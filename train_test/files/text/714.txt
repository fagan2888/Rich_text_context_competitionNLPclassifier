Background and Purpose--Elevated serum total homocyst(e)ine [H(e)] is an independent risk factor for stroke. Few
studies, however, have examined this association in blacks.
Methods--Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n4534), a nationally representative
sample of US adults, were used to examine the relationship between H(e) and a physician diagnosis of stroke (n185)
in both black and white adults. Multivariate-adjusted logistic regression analyses were used to examine this relationship.
Results--Serum vitamin B12
and folate concentrations were significantly lower among participants in the highest H(e)
quartile (12.1 mol/L) than among participants in the lowest quartile (7.4 mol/L). Those in the highest quartile
were older, had higher mean cholesterol and blood pressure levels, and were more likely to smoke and to have completed
12 years of education. After adjustment for age, the odds ratio (OR) for stroke was 2.9 (95% confidence interval [CI],
1.4 to 5.7; highest versus lowest quartile). Adjustment for gender, race/ethnicity, education, systolic blood pressure,
cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, and smoking reduced the magnitude of the association (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2 to 4.6). The
association between H(e) and stroke did not differ by race [P0.265 for race-H(e) interaction term]. The multivariate
adjusted OR for the highest quartile versus the lowest was 2.5 (1.1 to 5.5) among whites and 1.4 (0.4 to 4.7) among
blacks.
Conclusions--In this nationally representative sample of US adults, H(e) concentration was independently associated with
an increased likelihood of nonfatal stroke. This association was present in both black and white adults. (Stroke.
1998;29:2473-2477.)
Key Words: epidemiology  homocyst(e)ine  race  stroke
Elevated serum total homocyst(e)ine [H(e)] concentrations
are an independent risk factor for stroke,1­3 coronary
heart disease,4­9 and peripheral vascular disease.10,11 H(e)
includes all molecular species that are measured and consti-
tute the risk factor: homocysteine, homocystine, and the
mixed homocysteine-cysteine disulfide. In a meta-analysis
examining the association between H(e) and coronary heart
disease, Boushey and colleagues12 reported that a 5-mol/L
increase in H(e) was associated with an OR of 1.6 in men and
1.8 in women. Because of the paucity of studies, however,
Boushey and colleagues were unable to comment on any
possible racial differences in the association between H(e)
and risk for cardiovascular disease.
H(e) concentrations can be affected by several nutritional
and genetic factors. Folate consumption is a major determi-
nant of H(e) concentration, and blacks tend to have substan-
tially lower folate consumption rates than their white coun-
terparts.13 We previously reported that the association
between low serum folate concentration and risk of stroke
was stronger among blacks than among their white counter-
parts.14 We hypothesized that this finding reflected a stronger
association between H(e) and stroke among blacks.
To date, most of the studies examining the association
between H(e) and stroke have been conducted in selected
populations that may not reflect the age, gender, and racial or
ethnic distribution of the general US population.1­12 In addi-
tion, few studies have included blacks or Mexican Ameri-
cans. We used data from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a nationally
representative sample of US adults, to examine the cross-

tal stroke and to determine whether this association was
stronger among black adults than among their white
counterparts.
Subjects and Methods
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center
for Health Statistics conducted the NHANES III between 1988 and
1994 to estimate the prevalence of common chronic conditions and
associated risk factors among a nationally representative sample of
the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population.15 The survey in-
cluded a household interview; a medical examination at a mobile
examination center; and phlebotomy to measure a number of
hematologic factors, including H(e).
The study sample included 4534 persons who were over age 35
and who underwent testing for H(e). Serum H(e) concentrations were
measured during phase II of the NHANES III survey (1992­1994).
Blood that was drawn during the medical examination was processed
with use of a standard protocol,16 and sera were stored at 70°C for
8 months to 3 years before analysis. The high-performance liquid
chromatography method of Araki and Sako17 was used to obtain H(e)
measurements at the US Department of Agriculture's Human Nutri-
tion Research Center on Aging. H(e) concentrations ranged from 3.1
to 132.0 mol/L and were grouped into the following quartiles:
7.4 mol/L, 7.5 to 9.3 mol/L, 9.4 to 12.0 mol/L, and
12.1 mol/L.
During the household interview, 185 participants (4.1%) answered
in the affirmative to the question, "Has a doctor ever told you that
you had a stroke?" Potential confounders in the association between
H(e) and nonfatal stroke included age, gender, race/ethnicity (white,
black, and Mexican American), education, systolic blood pressure,
cholesterol, and cigarette smoking. Systolic blood pressure was the
mean of the second and third blood pressure determinations taken
during the physical examination. Although serum folate and vitamin
B12
concentrations were not considered potential confounders in the
association between H(e) and stroke, we examined whether serum
folate and vitamin B12
concentrations differed by H(e) quartile and
stroke status. Because folate, vitamin B12
, and H(e) concentrations
were positively skewed, we log transformed the values and present
both arithmetic and geometric means for groups defined by H(e)
quartile and stroke status.
We used t tests and 2 tests to compare groups defined by H(e)
quartile and stroke status. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were
used to determine whether the likelihood for stroke differed by H(e)
quartile. The logistic regression model was adjusted for the following
cardiovascular disease risk factors: age, gender, race/ethnicity, educa-
tion, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol concentration, and smoking
status. An ordinal variable, with values ranging from 1 to 4 to denote the
4 H(e) quartiles, was included in the multivariate logistic regression
model to test for linear trend. The analysis was also stratified by race to
determine whether the association between H(e) and stroke differed by
race. The number of Mexican Americans who experienced a stroke
(n38) was too small to allow analysis of the association between H(e)
and stroke in this population. The NHANES III data were weighted to
make the results representative of the entire US population. To take into
account the complex sampling design in the NHANES III survey,
SUDAAN18 was used to obtain standard errors for the prevalence
estimates and ORs.
Results
Persons in the highest H(e) quartile were older and had higher
mean systolic blood pressure and cholesterol values than
those in the lowest quartile (Table 1). The percentage of
persons in the highest quartile who were men (56.0%) was
almost twice the percentage in the lowest quartile (29.2%).
The percentage of blacks in each quartile did not differ; in
contrast, the percentage of Mexican Americans in the highest
quartile (3.3%) was approximately half that in the lowest
quartile (5.9%). The prevalence of diabetes mellitus, low
educational attainment (12 years of education), and current
smoking increased with H(e) concentration. Finally, as ex-
pected, an inverse relationship was observed between serum
folate concentration and H(e) quartile (P0.001) and be-
tween vitamin B12
concentration and H(e) quartile (P0.001).

Persons in the lowest H(e) quartile had a mean serum folate
concentration of 10.7 ng/mL, while persons in the highest
quartile had a mean folate concentration of 5.5 ng/mL.
NHANES III participants who had suffered a stroke were
older and had higher systolic blood pressure values than
participants who had not suffered a stroke (Table 2). In
addition, stroke sufferers were more likely to have 12 years
of education, to be diabetic, and to be either current or former
smokers. There was no significant difference between the 2
groups in mean folate or vitamin B12
concentration. For H(e)
concentration, however, a significant difference was found:
persons who had suffered a stroke had a mean H(e) concen-
tration of 11.9 mol/L whereas those who had not had a mean
H(e) concentration of 10.2 mol/L (P0.001).
The likelihood for nonfatal stroke increased with H(e)
concentration (Table 3). The multivariate-adjusted ORs com-
paring the second, third, and fourth H(e) quartiles to the
lowest quartile were 1.7 (95% CI, 0.8 to 4.0), 2.5 (95% CI,
1.2 to 5.5), and 2.3 (95% CI, 1.2 to 4.6), respectively. An
interquartile increase in H(e) was associated with an OR of
1.2 (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.6). The association between H(e) and
stroke was similar in both whites and blacks (P0.265 for
race-H(e) interaction; see the Figure); comparing the highest
with the lowest quartile, the OR for stroke was 2.5 (95% CI,
1.1 to 5.5) among whites and 1.4 (95% CI, 0.4 to 4.7) among
blacks. Because of the limited number of stroke events among
blacks (n48), the analysis was repeated, with the division of
H(e) concentrations into the following tertiles: 8.0, 8.1 to
10.8, and 10.9 mol/L. The multivariate adjusted ORs
comparing the second and third tertiles with the lowest tertile
were 1.6 (0.5 to 5.6) and 1.7 (0.8 to 4.5) among blacks and 1.1
(0.5 to 2.4) and 1.8 (0.8 to 4.1) among whites, respectively.
Discussion
These are the first data from a nationally representative
sample of US adults to document an association between H(e)
and nonfatal stroke. Persons in the highest H(e) quartile were

approximately twice as likely to have suffered a stroke as
those in the lowest quartile. The results from this cross-
sectional study indicate that the association between H(e) and
prevalent stroke was similar among black and white adults.
Although the association between H(e) and stroke did not
achieve statistical significance among blacks, the results do
suggest a modest association between H(e) and stroke in this
population. The lack of statistical significance was largely
due to the limited number of prevalent stroke events among
blacks (n48). There were 20 strokes in each of the 4
quartiles and 10 strokes in the lowest 2 H(e) quartiles.
Repeating the race-stratified analysis by tertile increased the
stability of the ORs, as noted by the narrower CIs.
In the present study we found that several cardiovascular
disease risk factors were strongly associated with H(e)
concentrations, including age, systolic blood pressure, and
total cholesterol concentrations. These findings are consistent
with those of the Hordaland Homocyst(e)ine Study,19 another
cross-sectional study from Norway that examined the corre-
lates of H(e) in a sample of 7591 men and 8585 women aged
40 to 67 years.
In addition, we found that completing 12 years of
education was associated with higher H(e) concentrations.
Such an association may be mediated through the consump-
tion of the B vitamins B12
, B6
, and folate. Results from
NHANES II20 indicate that the percentage of persons with
low red blood cell folate values was higher for both men and
women with incomes below the poverty level; however, this
difference did not achieve statistical significance.
Both the present study and the Hordaland Homocyst(e)ine
Study19 found that cigarette smoking was positively associ-
ated with H(e) concentrations. Similarly, data from the Stroke
Prevention in Young Women Study21 found that as the
number of cigarettes smoked per day increased, so did H(e)
concentrations. Additional studies should examine whether
smoking cessation can reduce H(e) concentrations.
These results from NHANES III suggest that the percent-
age of blacks do not differ according to H(e) quartile, a
finding consistent with data from the Stroke Prevention in
Young Women Study,21 which reported similar H(e) distri-
butions in black and white women. These results may seem
surprising, given that blacks have substantially lower folate
intakes than their white counterparts.13 However, an impor-
tant genetic determinant of H(e), a polymorphism associated
with the thermolabile variant to the enzyme 5,10-methylene-
tetrahydrofolate reductase, appears to be substantially less
prevalent among blacks than among whites.22,23 This poly-
morphism has been associated with elevated H(e) concentra-
tions, particularly when folate concentrations are low.23
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
report any information on H(e) concentrations among Mexi-
can Americans. Reasons for the low percentage of Mexican
Americans among those in the highest H(e) quartile are
unclear. Data from NHANES III13 indicate that Mexican
Americans have folate intakes similar to or lower than those
of their white counterparts. In contrast, vitamin B12
intakes
were slightly higher among Mexican Americans in NHANES
III compared with their white counterparts. This finding was
particularly true among Mexican American women over age
60.13 Whether a lower prevalence of genetic polymorphisms
associated with H(e) concentration, such as the thermolabile
variant to the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase,
may also explain the lower H(e) concentrations among
Mexican Americans needs further exploration. In addition,
whether lower H(e) levels can partially explain the lower
stroke mortality rates among Hispanic adults should also be
examined in future studies.24 Unfortunately, the number of
stroke events among Mexican Americans was insufficient to
examine the association between H(e) and stroke in
NHANES III.
Elevated H(e) concentration appears to be an independent
risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and the increased
consumption of folate, vitamin B12
, and vitamin B6
may
reduce H(e) values. Whether increased consumption of these
B vitamins can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease has
not been determined. Currently, several primary and second-
ary cardiovascular disease prevention trials are attempting to
answer this question.

The present study has several potential limitations. First,
because the data were derived from a cross-sectional study,
one cannot infer the direction of the associations. However,
prospective studies3,25 have reported an association between
H(e) and stroke, and the magnitude of the association appears
to be similar to that presented in this report. Second, H(e)
concentrations were not obtained from fasting adults in all
cases. However, limiting the sample to those adults who were
fasting did not appreciably change the risk estimates. Finally,
we were able to evaluate only nonfatal stroke events. Data
from patients with coronary heart disease suggest that the
association between H(e) and coronary heart disease may be
stronger for fatal than for nonfatal events.26 If this finding is
also true for stroke, it is likely that the magnitude of the
association would have been even stronger if fatal stroke
events had been included.
In conclusion, data from this nationally representative
sample of US adults indicate that persons in the highest H(e)
quartile have approximately twice the likelihood of nonfatal
stroke as those in the lowest H(e) quartile. This increased
likelihood was noted in both blacks and whites. There is a
paucity of data on the relationship between H(e) and stroke
among Mexican Americans, and there is a clear need for
additional studies. Future studies, including primary and
secondary prevention trials, should include an adequate
number of persons from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds to
further examine the complex relationships between race/
ethnicity, folate, vitamin B6
, vitamin B12
, H(e) and the risk for
cardiovascular disease.
