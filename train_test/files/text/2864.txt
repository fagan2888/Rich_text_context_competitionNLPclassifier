INTERCOMPANY LOANS AND PROFIT SHIFTING
­ EVIDENCE FROM COMPANY-LEVEL DATA
Abstract
This paper is concerned with tax-planning strategies of multinational corporations. A
theoretical analysis discusses the choice of the capital structure in a setting where
intercompany loans can be used to shift profits to low-tax countries. Empirical evidence is
provided using micro-level panel data of virtually all German multinationals made available
by the Bundesbank. This comprehensive dataset allows us to exploit differences in taxing
conditions of almost eighty countries during a period of nine years. The empirical results
confirm a robust impact of tax-rate differences within the multinational group on the use of
intercompany loans, supporting the profit-shifting hypothesis. However, the implied tax-
revenue effects are rather small, suggesting that costs related to adjusting the capital structure
for profit-shifting purposes are substantial.

1 Introduction
Much of the discussion about international tax competition is centered around the impact
of taxes on multinational corporations' location and investment decisions (for surveys see
Hines, 1999, and de Mooij and Ederveen, 2003). However, it is often neglected that there are
many more dimensions along which the multinational corporation can structure its activities
internationally, and that decisions related to production and trade are only part of the story.
From a taxation perspective, the fact that those corporations hold affiliates in different
countries opens up many opportunities for tax planning with the aim to minimize their
overall tax burden. This might be quite important for the tax revenue from corporation
taxes and, furthermore, may significantly alter the way taxes affect location and investment
decisions and the business sector as a whole.
As is well noted in the literature (e.g., Hines and Rice, 1994, Gresik, 2001), a multinational
corporation has several ways to engage in tax planning other than choosing location and
level of investment. One important determinant of the tax burden is the transfer price
for goods and services traded within the corporation (for a theoretical discussion see e.g.,
Haufler and Schjelderup, 2000; for empirical evidence see e.g., Swenson, 2001, Clausing,
2003). Apart from transfer pricing, multinationals have enhanced opportunities with respect
to tax planning as they can use external as well as internal funds in order to adjust their
capital structure. This allows multinationals not only to arbitrage more easily across different
lending markets. It also opens up opportunities for tax planning by means of intercompany
loans. Borrowing from affiliates located in low-tax countries and lending to affiliates in high-
tax locations will allow the latter to deduct interest payments from profits and save taxes
(Mintz and Smart, 2004).
While several papers document some significant degree of profit shifting of multinationals
(e.g., Grubert and Mutti, 1991, or Hines and Rice, 1994), the empirical literature so far does
not provide conclusive evidence that intercompany loans actually play an important role in
1
this respect. Several papers show that the leverage of multinationals' affiliates is sensitive to
the tax rate in the host country (e.g., Jog and Tang, 2001, Mintz and Smart, 2004). However,
the tax shelter from debt gives rise to a tax-rate sensitivity of the leverage of any corporation,
including multinationals' affiliates as well as domestic corporations. For instance, Gordon
and Lee (2001) find a strong tax sensitivity of the leverage of US corporations.
Only some recent papers explicitly consider intercompany loans. Desai, Foley, and Hines
(2004a) analyze the capital structure of US multinationals and report a significant tax sen-
sitivity of both external and internal debt. Mintz and Weichenrieder (2005) and Buettner
et al. (2006) confirm their findings for German multinationals. As the main result of Desai
et al. is that internal debt serves as a substitute to external debt, it is, however, not clear
whether the tax sensitivity of intercompany loans reflects profit shifting or the standard tax
shelter from debt. In fact, as shown by Mintz and Smart (2004), profit shifting by means of
intercompany loans should not be sensitive to the local tax rate but to the tax-rate difference
between the lending and the borrowing affiliate within the multinational group.
This paper, therefore, studies how those tax-rate differences within the multinational group
affect the capital structure of multinationals and, in particular, the use of intercompany
loans. For this purpose we use a large micro-level panel database of virtually all German
multinationals made available for research by the German Bundesbank. This comprehensive
dataset allows us to exploit tax-rate differences in 79 countries, among those many low-tax
or tax-haven countries. For each affiliate within the multinational group the appropriate
tax-rate difference is calculated relative to the lowest tax rate observed among all affiliates.
The empirical results strongly support a significant impact of this tax-rate differential on
intercompany loans, implying that intercompany loans are indeed used to shift profits from
high- to low-tax countries. However, the implied tax revenue effects are rather small. This
finding is indicative for substantial costs of adjusting the capital structure for profit-shifting
purposes.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we model a corporation which is active at
2
different locations, including low-tax countries. The corporation is assumed to maximize
profits by optimally allocating internal funds with respect to differences in international
taxation. From the optimality conditions we obtain testable empirical implications, which
are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 gives a short description of the dataset and discusses
the investigation approach. Section 5 provides descriptive statistics. The basic results are
presented in Section 6. Some further evidence showing how the results change with the share
of ownership is presented in Section 7. Section 8 provides our conclusion.
2 Theoretical Considerations
Consider a multinational group with affiliates at N locations. For simplicity, let us assume
that each location is situated in a different country such that the tax system varies between
locations. The profit function of the group is given by
 =
N
i=1
f (ki
) (1 - i
)
-
N
j=1
N
i=1
[ij
ji
ki
] (1 - i
)
-
N
j=1
N
i=1,i=j
[ij
µji
ki
] (1 - i
) +
N
j=1,i=j
N
i=1
[ij
µji
ki
] (1 - j
)
- r
N
i=1
1 -
j
ji
ki
-
N
i=1
ci
(1i
, ..., ji
, ..., N,i
, µ1i
, ..., µji
, ..., µNi
) ki
, with µii
= 0.
Let us briefly discuss the components of this profit function. The first line captures the
contribution of output, f(ki
), taking account of the fact that a part of the corresponding
profit is taxed away. The host country statutory tax rate is denoted with i
. The second
line shows the interest costs which, similarly, enter profits only after tax deduction. ij
is
3
the corresponding lending rate at location j. Note that this term captures also the interest
costs related to intercompany loans, provided the corporation raises a credit at country j
and transfers the money to the affiliate in country i such that ji
> 0. The third line is
also concerned with intercompany loans but reports the contribution of pure profit shifting
where some financial capital is shifted from one location to the other, without increasing
outside debt. The fourth line reports the cost of capital financed with equity. The fifth line,
finally, captures cost of borrowing in addition to the market lending rate which are assumed
to increase with the various types of debt in the model.2,3 Note that the general specification
used here assumes that the additional cost of borrowing of affiliate i are increasing not only
in the share of capital financed with external debt ji
. In fact, the analysis follows Mintz
and Smart (2004) and assumes that the additional cost of borrowing will also increase in the
share financed with internal debt µji
as this also implies a decline in the equity share of the
lending affiliate. Note that the cost function is indexed with the host country to reflect the
potential role of this country's credit-market regulations for the underlying conflict between
debtors and creditors.4
2The additional cost of borrowing function is assumed to be convex. More specifically, we assume
ci
ji
> 0, ci
µji
> 0, 2ci
2
ji
> 0, 2ci
µ2
ji
> 0.
3The corporate finance literature (see Tirole, 2006, for an overview) justifies the existence of those addi-
tional cost of debt on several grounds. A first set of arguments refers to the possible cost of financial distress
including bankruptcy as well as agency costs related to the conflict between debtors and creditors (e.g.,
Myers, 2001). Another strand of the literature (e.g., Aghion and Bolton, 1989, and Hart, 1988), emphasizes
the role of agency costs between shareholders and management. From this perspective, some debt might be
useful to ensure control rights of investors in bad states, for instance, if a firm goes bankrupt. But, since
equity allows the manager to control the corporation in good states, a tax-induced increase in the debt-asset
ratio relative to the optimal level would imply an inefficiency which contributes to the additional cost of
borrowing.
4Note that increasing additional cost of intercompany loans would also arise if the host country imposes
restrictions on the use of intercompany loans for profit shifting (see below).
4
The optimality conditions are

ji
= -ij
(1 - i
) ki
+ rki
-
ci
ji
ki
!
= 0

µji
= -ij
(1 - i
) ki
+ ij
(1 - j
) ki
-
ci
µji
ki
!
= 0.
In the general case, the loan from affiliate j to affiliate i financed with a credit from country
j is, among other determinants, a function of the corresponding after-tax rate of interest
ji
= gi
( r - ij
(1 - i
) , ... ) with
gi
ij
(1 - i
)
< 0. (1)
The loan from affiliate j to affiliate i financed with equity depends on the tax-rate difference
µji
= hi
( ij
(i
- j
) , ... ) with
hi
ij
(i
- j
)
> 0. (2)
If we impose somewhat more structure on the analysis, we can generate more specific pre-
dictions:
A restrictive case is provided by Buettner et al. (2006), who are concerned with the leverage
of a single foreign affiliate held by a German parent. In this case, the fact that Germany is
a high-tax country makes it rather unlikely to observe a positive tax-rate differential that
gives an incentive to shift profits from foreign affiliates into Germany. Thus, with tj
> ti
, µji
is zero, and all intercompany loans from j to i reflect external debt for the lending affiliate.
Therefore, in this case, the leverage is determined by the corresponding after-tax cost of
interest according to Equation 1.
Mintz and Smart (2004) consider another case where all intercompany loans relate to profit
shifting. In our approach this case is obtained if r < ij
(1 - i
) and, hence, ji
is zero. In
this case, the leverage is determined by the tax-rate difference between the affiliates located
5
in i and j evaluated with the lending rate.
For our purposes let us consider a slightly more general case with a simplified cost function
where we aggregate among different kinds of loans. If we assume that loans of the same kind
are perfect substitutes the cost function can be written as
ci
= ci
ii
,
j=i
ji
,
j=i
µji
. (3)
This cost function distinguishes three kinds of debt. As a consequence, the first-order condi-
tions for all intercompany loans of the same kind involve the same marginal cost. If interest
rates differ, this implies that the leverage related to intercompany loans refinanced with
external capital
j=i
ji
, is determined by the local tax rate and the lowest lending rate
among all locations
ji
> 0, where j = arg min
k
ik
, and zero otherwise. (4)
With this condition, ji
follows from Equation 1. In contrast, the other kind of intercompany
loans
j=i
µji
, which are not refinanced externally, is determined by the largest tax-rate
difference evaluated at the lending rate
µji
> 0, where j = arg max
k
ik
(i
- k
) , and zero otherwise. (5)
With this condition, the optimal level of µji
is determined by Equation 2.
3 Empirical Implications
The analysis below aims at testing the empirical implications of the above model. Basically,
our analysis is concerned with the implications of the first-order conditions and considers
the empirical determinants of the debt-asset ratio where we focus on intercompany loans.
6
The debt-asset ratio Li
of each affiliate i consists of three components
Li
 ii
+
j=i
ji
+
j=i
µji
ICLi
, (6)
where the first component is the amount of debt directly raised from external creditors, the
second and third components together make up the amount of intercompany loans (ICLi
).
The theory distinguishes intercompany loans re-financed with external credit, which are used
to arbitrage across capital markets (ji
), from loans not externally re-financed (µji
), which
are used to shift profits. However, this distinction is generally not observable empirically.
Instead, balance-sheet data, like those used in the current study, usually provide some figures
for Li
and ICLi
.
Abstracting from possible differences in the lending rate, the optimality conditions for ij
and µij
suggest that the share of capital of an affiliate financed with intercompany loans
should not only be affected by the local tax rate but also by a positive tax-rate differential
with regard to other locations where the multinational holds affiliates.5 As we have seen
above, the empirical implications of the theory depend on the function for the additional
cost of borrowing. Assuming that this cost function follows (3) such that intercompany loans
of the same kind but from different locations are perfect substitutes, the share of capital of
an affiliate i held by corporation k financed with intercompany loans ICLi,k
should be a
function of the local tax rate i
and the maximal tax-rate difference (i
- min
k
) with regard
to all other affiliates in the multinational group (min
k
is the lowest local tax rate among all
affiliates of the group as implied by Equation 5). In other words, the theory suggests not only
5We abstract from differences in the lending rate since our basic database does not provide corresponding
information and external data sources are not available for the large number of countries involved. In our
empirical analysis, however, we control for differences in the lending rate driven by country characteristics
such as country risk, creditor rights, and the size of the credit market by including country fixed effects.
Firm specific differences in the lending rate are controlled by variables such as the turnover and by company-
and group-specific fixed effects.

to take account of the local tax rate faced by an affiliate in order to capture the traditional
tax shelter of debt finance. Instead, we should also take account of the tax-rate difference
to the lowest tax rate among all affiliates of a multinational group as this determines the
potential tax savings from profit shifting.
4 Data and Investigation Approach
A basic problem in the empirical analysis of the tax effects on corporate decisions is to
formulate an approach with sufficient empirical variation in the incentives generated by
the tax system. In the current study we utilize a micro-level panel dataset of German
multinationals which offers substantial variation in three dimensions:
1. A first dimension relates to the international perspective, as the dataset reports the
capital structure of each of the foreign affiliates of a multinational that operates in
various countries. While the database considers the multinational's activities globally,
the empirical analysis is based on a sample of 79 countries for which reliable information
with regard to corporate income taxation is available.
2. Another dimension that offers variation in the taxing conditions is the time dimension.
The panel data covers each multinational's activities as well as the taxing conditions
on an annual basis in the period from 1996 until 2004.
8
3. The third dimension is related to the heterogeneity of the affiliates that vary in the tax-
rate difference relative to the lowest level of the tax rate observed among all affiliates
in the group. Note that this type of variation refers to each individual affiliate in the
dataset.
In order to test the empirical implications as outlined in the previous section, we employ a
micro-level dataset for German multinationals (MiDi) provided by the Bundesbank. This
contains a comprehensive annual database of foreign direct investment positions of German
enterprizes held abroad. The data provides information about each foreign affiliate's balance
sheet and some further information about the ownership and about the German investor. In
its current version, firm-level panel data for foreign affiliates are available for the period 1996
to 2004.6 Each German multinational has to report its foreign assets, including both directly
and indirectly held FDI, conditional on some lower threshold level for mandatory reporting.7
Basically, the estimation sample comprises balance-sheet information of virtually all German
outbound investments from 1996 to 2004, regardless of the legal form, of whether directly
or indirectly held, and of whether subsidiaries are wholly or only partly owned. While
the dataset reports the capital share of intercompany loans received by foreign affiliates,
comparable information is not available for the German parent. As a consequence, the focus
of our study is on the capital structure of foreign affiliates.
With regard to the lending part of intercompany loans, the dataset distinguishes intercom-
pany loans received from the parent as well as intercompany loans received from other foreign
affiliates.8 This allows us to restrict the focus of the empirical analysis even more closely
6Data collection is enforced by German law, which determines reporting mandates for international
transactions as part of the Law on Foreign Trade and Payments and corresponding regulations.
7Since 2002 FDI has to be reported if the participation is 10% or more and the balance-sheet total of the
foreign object is above 3 million euro. For details see Lipponer (2006). Though previous years showed lower
threshold levels, we apply this threshold level uniformly for all years in the panel.
8The corresponding position is "...liabilities to affiliated enterprizes ... outside of Germany" (see Lipponer,
2006).
9
to intercompany loans granted as well as received by foreign affiliates, since, as Germany is
a high-tax country, there is little reason to expect German parents to issue intercompany
loans to their foreign affiliates for profit-shifting purposes.
Figure 1 provides a graphical illustration of the focus of the analysis by depicting a multina-
tional corporation with two foreign affiliates, where the parent as well as one of the affiliates
are located in high-tax countries but a third affiliate is located in a low-tax country.9 In
this setting, intercompany loans granted by the foreign affiliate in the low-tax country might
be used to shift profits into this country. While this might involve loans to the parent as
well as to the foreign affiliate in the high-tax country, as discussed above, the focus of the
current paper is only on the latter relationship, depicted by the vertical arrows in the figure.
As a consequence, the empirical analysis is concerned with multinational corporations with
affiliates in more than one foreign country ­ binational corporations are excluded.
As we focus on intercompany loans granted as well as received by foreign affiliates, we
implicitly assume that the taxing conditions for these foreign affiliates are decisive for the
company group. This might be questioned in a context where the parent company would
have to pay taxes on worldwide profits, as in a regime of foreign tax credit. However,
note that for German multinationals as well as for most other European multinationals
the exemption principle applies. This could be different in the U.S. case, where foreign
earnings are taxed subject to a foreign tax credit. However, recent literature argues that the
anti-abuse controlled foreign corporation (CFC) provisions are not effective (e.g., Mutti and
Grubert, 2006). Thus, tax planning of U.S. corporations might be similar.
Since taxing conditions vary in more than one dimension, we can further exploit the micro-
level structure of the dataset and explore the capital structure of multinationals using panel-
data techniques. Following our discussion of the empirical implications, the analysis is based
9The company structure can be, of course, much more complicated in the data. On average, we observe
about five foreign subsidiaries per multinational in our basic estimation sample.

where (i,t

) is the affiliate-specific tax-rate difference and i,t
is the statutory tax
rate applicable to affiliate i. The dependent variable, ICL, is defined by the amount of
intercompany loans received by a foreign affiliate i from other foreign affiliates within the
multinational group k divided by total capital.
Note that the basic specification includes time effects, t
, possibly capturing differences in
the treatment of foreign earnings in the home country (Germany) of the multinational and
other aggregate shocks. The specification also takes account of a specific effect for each multi-
national group, k
. This is important in the current context since group-specific risk would
affect the lending rate and the additional cost of borrowing (Desai, Foley, and Hines, 2004a).
11
Using group-specific fixed effects also allows us to condition on the international structure
of each group. This is important since we exploit the differences in the group structure in
order to identify tax incentives but do not model the choice of the group structure. We
also employ affiliate-specific control variables, xk,i,t
, which capture some heterogeneity in the
borrowing costs across affiliates. Borrowing costs might also be related to country-specific
conditions in the lending market such as bankruptcy laws, creditor rights, etc. This would
suggest to further include country-specific effects. Finally, since borrowing costs may also
vary with the branch of the affiliate, sector-specific effects could also be included.
5 Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 provides some information about the basic characteristics of the sample of multi-
nationals. Three different samples are distinguished: the full sample comprises all foreign-
direct-investment observations available. A reduced sample excludes all binational corpora-
tions, where a structure as in Figure 1 cannot be observed, obviously, and considers only
affiliates where information about the local tax rate is available. Whereas we use information
from the second sample in order to compute the lowest tax rate within the group, the third
is the ultimate estimation sample where some further restrictions apply (see below).
The last two columns report the capital of all considered affiliates where a significant share
is held by the reporting multinational. Comparing the aggregate stock of capital in the first
and second sample, we see that, even if many countries are excluded, still between 80% and
90% of all reported capital is covered by the second sample. This is different with the third
sample, which is the basic sample for the regression analysis below. This sample further
excludes affiliates with zero turnover. While this restriction implies a considerable decline
in the number of observations, the reason is to focus on the capital structure of productive
affiliates as in the above theoretical model.10
10Note, however, that our estimation results proved to be robust against the inclusion of affiliates with

Capital consists of registered capital, capital reserves, profit reserves, as well as internal and external
debt. The total capital figure is an unweighted annual average for the period from 1996 to 2004. Sam-
ple 1 comprises all foreign direct investment observations (outbound investment), Sample 2 employs
all affiliates where corporate tax rate information is available and excludes binational corporations,
Sample 3 further excludes all observations with zero turnover.
As has been discussed above, we employ affiliate- and group-specific indicators of the tax
incentives for profit shifting. More specifically, we proceed in two steps. First, we determine
for each multinational the lowest corporate income-tax rate observed among all of its foreign
affiliates based on Sample 2. (For ease of exposition we will refer to the corresponding
affiliate as the lowest-tax affiliate.) In a second step, we use this group-specific minimum tax
rate as the benchmark for the group and compute the tax-rate differential of the local tax
rate to this benchmark for each of the affiliates. As a consequence, high-tax affiliates will
show large positive tax-rate differentials, whereas the tax-rate differential for the lowest-tax
affiliate is zero.
Let us emphasize once more that the tax-rate differential with regard to the lowest-tax affili-
ate is not determined on basis of the estimation sample but on basis of the more comprehen-
sive Sample 2 of Table 1. In other words, while we focus on the finances of the productive
entities of multinational corporations, we take into account in a much more comprehen-
sive way the incentives for profit shifting and include the incentives for using intercompany
loans in order to shift profits to foreign affiliates, including purely non-productive tax-haven
zero turnover.

affiliates.
Table 2 provides some information about which countries typically host the lowest-tax affil-
iates. The second column lists the number of all affiliates reported in each of the countries.
The third column, denoted with  = 0, lists all observations where the respective country
hosts the lowest-tax affiliate. While we see that most affiliates are reported in the U.S., in
the U.K., and in France, the lowest-tax affiliate is quite often found in Switzerland, Hungary,
Poland, and Austria.
Table 3 displays descriptive statistics for variables used in the empirical analysis. While the
tax-rate variable is measured at the level of the country, all other variables including the
tax-rate differential vary by affiliate. A first impression of the relative importance of debt as
a means of profit shifting as compared to the standard tax shelter from debt is given by the
three different borrowing variables. While the total leverage is almost 60%, intercompany
loans make up only a capital share of 24.2%. This figure still includes intercompany loans
from the German parent to foreign affiliates which, given Germany's high tax rate, is quite
unlikely related to profit shifting. Intercompany loans received from other foreign affiliates
amount only to an average capital share of 10.6%.
Table 4 provides further descriptive evidence for the impact of taxes on intercompany loans.
It displays the share of capital financed with different kinds of debt for the basic sample
as well as for various sub-samples. For ease of comparison, column (1) repeats the mean
values as reported above. Columns (2) and (3) report the share of intercompany loans
observed among the affiliates of those multinational corporations which hold at least one
affiliate in a low-tax country. Column (2) defines the low-tax country as a country with
a tax rate below the 10% percentile of the tax-rate distribution, column (3) uses the even
stricter definition based on the 5% percentile of the tax-rate distribution. If corporations
use intercompany loans for profit shifting, we should expect the mean to be higher for those
multinational corporations. In fact, the capital share of intercompany loans (excluding those
obtained from the German parent) is higher by about 30 to 40%, indicating that the use of

intercompany loans is much more prevalent among multinationals with affiliates in low-tax
countries. Conversely, the affiliate experiencing the lowest tax rate within the group should
display a much lower capital share of intercompany loans. As reported in column (4), the
mean capital share for those affiliates is lower by about 25%. This confirms the theoretical
view, as there should be little incentive to shift profits out of those countries.
6 Basic Results
Table 5 reports basic regression results following Equation 7. In order to control for group-
specific risks, all estimations employ fixed effects for the company group. Moreover, time
dummies are included in order to capture differences in the taxation of the parent. Given
the limited information in the balance sheet of the affiliates, only two direct control variables
are included. Since the effective tax reduction from using debt might be zero if an affiliate
carries forward any losses for tax purposes (see MacKie-Mason, 1990), we include a variable
indicating whether some loss carry-forward is reported. Some specifications will also include
the turnover of the affiliate, since a larger cash-flow might be associated with less credit-
market constraints and, hence, might facilitate access to external credits.
Throughout the different specifications, the tax-rate differential shows a significantly positive
effect, whereas the host-country tax rate proves insignificant. This confirms the theoretical
prediction in the sense that corporations use intercompany loans to shift profits. At the
same time, the insignificance of the tax rate indicates that the intercompany loans between
foreign affiliates do not play an important role in minimizing the cost of capital by engaging
in arbitrage across lending conditions of affiliate locations. Given the magnitude of this
other type of intercompany loans, this function might well be carried out by loans from the
German parent (cf. Table 3).
Qualitatively, there is not much difference between specifications. Column (4) includes a

control for a loss-carry forward as the incentive to save taxes is reduced in this case. The
positive sign possibly reflects the desire of shareholders to get more control of an affiliate's
management if the performance is weak. It might also simply reflect the substitutive rela-
tionship to external debt (Desai et al., 2004a). This could also explain the negative sign for
turnover which is taken into account in column (5). The specifications in columns (6) to (9)
additionally employ industry-level dummies following a classification of affiliates according
to 71 industries. This might help to further control for differences in the financial risk related
to an affiliate's activities. Columns (8) and (9), finally, use controls for the host country in
order to make sure that no country-specific characteristics are driving the results. While the
results prove to be robust, some part of the variation is swallowed up by the country-specific
dummies. Hence, we would consider column (7) of Table 5 as the preferred specification.
Since in many cases the amount of intercompany loans received by an affiliate is zero, Table 6
reports results where those observations are excluded. However, the results show only minor
differences.
Quantitatively, we see from the preferred specification (7) of Table 5 that a ten percent-
age point increase in the tax-rate difference to the group-specific lowest-tax affiliate leads
to an approximately 0.68 percentage point higher internal-debt ratio. Expressed as a semi-
elasticity, a tax-rate difference by ten percentage points triggers a response in the correspond-
ing capital share by 6.4 percent. This figure is not much different from existing estimates
of the tax-rate sensitivity of debt. Corresponding calculations based on the estimates by
Desai et al. (2004a) yield a semi-elasticity of 10.2% (5.5%) for the sensitivity of an affiliate's
capital share of internal (external) debt. The findings of Buettner et al. (2006) suggest a
corresponding semi-elasticity of 6.2% (5.1%).
In order to get an impression of the magnitude of the effect on the tax base, consider the
case of an affiliate i with a stock of capital of $1 million. Suppose (pre-tax) profits are
$200,000. From the mean value of the leverage we would expect the affiliate to receive an
intercompany loan of about $106,000. Furthermore, let us assume a lending rate of 20%.

Deduction of interest costs reduces the tax base by $21,200, or 10.6%. Suppose now that the
corporation opens up a tax-haven affiliate j, where the corporation tax equals zero. Then,
assuming affiliate i's previous tax-rate difference is equal to the sample mean (12.4%) and
the statutory tax rate in country i is also equal to the mean (33.4%), the tax-rate difference
increases by 21 percentage points (33.4%­12.4%). Our estimate suggests that in this case the
intercompany loan would be increased by $14,280 (0.068×0.21×$1,000,000). Consequently,
the affiliate i's tax base further declines by $2,856, or 1.6%.
Consider another example, where we observe a tax reform in the host country of affiliate i.
Let us assume that the tax rate declines by ten percentage points and, thus, that also the
tax-rate differential declines by ten percentage points. Then, the intercompany loan would
decrease by $6,800 (0.068×0.1×$1,000,000). In this case, under the above assumptions,
affiliate i's tax base increases by $1,360, or 0.8%.
7 Results for Different Shares of Ownership
The rather small revenue effects might indicate that there are some important costs or re-
strictions which prevent corporations from using profit-shifting loans more aggressively. For
instance, host countries might enact specific policies which restrict the use of intercompany
loans. However, it is difficult to quantify the role of those restrictions. In fact, it proved
impossible to augment the current analysis based on almost 80 countries with informa-
tion about the existence and nature of corresponding rules such as thin-capitalization or
earnings-stripping rules. But, there might be other reasons why firms experience high costs
in adjusting the capital structure. While additional costs of using intercompany loans are
basically not observed in the dataset, some of their potential determinants are. Desai et.al
(2004b) argue that shared ownership of foreign affiliates is associated with coordination costs
which impede tax efficient structuring of worldwide operations. This view is supported by
Mintz and Weichenrieder (2006) who find a higher tax-rate sensitivity of intercompany loans
21
for wholly-owned subsidiaries. In terms of the above theoretical framework, this could imply
that the additional costs related to intercompany loans are lower and exhibit a smaller gra-
dient when the ownership share is higher. Thus, we might expect to find that intercompany
loans are used more if the ownership share is higher. We might also expect to find that
the sensitivity of intercompany loans to the tax-rate differential with regard to the lowest-
tax affiliate is increased when taking into account only majority holdings or wholly-owned
subsidiaries.
In order to test for differences in the sensitivity of intercompany loans to profit-shifting op-
portunities captured by the tax-rate differential, we augment the above estimation approach
(7) by interaction terms with dummies capturing the ownership share.11
Table 7 shows results for our basic sample. For ease of comparison, the first column re-
peats the basic result as displayed in column (7) of Table 5. Column (2) reports results
where we augment the basic approach with dummy variables for the ownership share. Both
dummy variables are highly significant, pointing at an increased use of intercompany loans
by majority- and wholly-owned subsidiaries. Note that the definition of majority-owned
subsidiaries does not include wholly-owned subsidiaries. Thus, the results indicate that
wholly-owned (partly-owned) subsidiaries show an about 5 (2) percentage points higher cap-
ital share of intercompany loans than affiliates without a majority participation.
Column (3) reports results where also the tax-rate differential is interacted with the two
dummy variables for the ownership share. The results support significant differences in the
tax-rate sensitivity. While the sensitivity with regard to the tax-rate differential shows a
negative effect for minority participation, a positive effect is supported for majority-owned
subsidiaries. The tax rate sensitivity for wholly-owned subsidiaries, however, is substantially
higher. Adding up coefficients we find that the coefficient of the tax-rate differential is about
11Dummies are preferred against a continuous interaction term for the ownership share since the dis-
tribution of the ownership share shows strong concentration at the 51% and 100% thresholds. However,
qualitatively, the results of corresponding estimates show no differences.

0.104 for wholly-owned subsidiaries. This indicates that a ten percentage point increase in
the tax-rate difference with regard to the lowest-tax affiliate leads to an approximately 1
percentage point higher internal-debt ratio. Expressed as a semi-elasticity evaluated at the
mean capital share for wholly-owned subsidiaries (0.120), a tax-rate change by ten percentage
points triggers a response in the corresponding debt ratio by about 8.7 percent.
From the theoretical discussion we know, however, that the additional cost function may
affect not only the sensitivity with regard to the tax-rate differential but also the sensitivity
with regard to all other indicators of the relative cost of equity and intercompany loans.
Therefore, columns (4) and (5) report results where the other determinants are interacted
with the ownership-share dummy variables as well. However, some of these interaction terms
are insignificant and the results on the sensitivity with regard to the tax-rate differential prove
to be robust.
In order to get an impression of how much the magnitude of the effect on the tax base is
increased with wholly-owned subsidiaries, let us again consider a case of a subsidiary with
a stock of capital of $1 million. From the mean leverage for wholly-owned corporations, we
would expect such a subsidiary to receive an intercompany loan of about $120,000. At a
lending rate of 20%, deduction of interest costs reduces the tax base by $24,000, or 12%.
Suppose now that the tax rate, and, therefore, the tax-rate difference, is decreased by 10
percentage points. Our preferred estimate of column (3) suggests that, in this case, the
intercompany loan would be reduced by $10,400 (0.104×0.1×$1,000,000). Consequently, the
tax base in the high-tax country would increase by $2,080, or 1.2 %. Although this is a
stronger effect than the one obtained for the whole sample, it still appears to be rather
small.

8 Conclusion
We have set up a model of a multinational corporation which uses intercompany loans for
two purposes. The first is to minimize cost of capital by making use of external credit and
engaging in arbitrage across affiliate locations. The second is to shift profits to low-tax ju-
risdictions. The theoretical analysis shows that the first purpose suggests that the use of
intercompany loans will be affected by the local tax rate. The second purpose, however,
causes intercompany loans to depend on the tax-rate differences between the lending and
the borrowing companies within the multinational group. Only this latter relationship is
indicative of profit shifting. Therefore, existing empirical evidence on the tax-rate sensi-
tivity of debt even if related to multinationals and intercompany loans does not reveal the
importance of profit-shifting activities.
Our empirical investigation studies whether the tax-rate differences within a multinational
group will help to predict intercompany loans. The analysis makes use of a large micro-
level panel dataset of virtually all German multinationals made available for research by
the Bundesbank. This comprehensive dataset allows us to exploit differences in the taxing
conditions in 79 countries, including many low-tax countries, in a period of nine years. For
each affiliate within the multinational group, we calculate the appropriate tax-rate difference
relative to the lowest tax rate observed among all foreign affiliates.
The empirical results confirm a robust significant impact of tax-rate differences within the
multinational group on the use of intercompany loans, supporting the profit-shifting hypoth-
esis. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that the implied magnitude of tax-revenue losses
is rather modest even for wholly-owned firms. To conclude, our findings are indicative for
substantial costs of adjusting the capital structure for means of profit shifting. As a conse-
quence, if profit-shifting is important as the literature suggests, multinationals seem to take
resort to alternative strategies of tax-planning. This would imply that further restrictions
imposed by tax policy on the capital structure of multinationals would not substantially
curb profit-shifting.

Datasources and Definitions
Firm-level data are taken from the micro-level dataset of the Bundesbank, see Lipponer
(2006) for an overview. The dependent variable, ICL, is determined by a balance-sheet
position capturing liabilities of foreign affiliates to other foreign affiliates within the
multinational group divided by the total stock of capital. The latter is defined as
the sum of registered capital, capital reserves, profit reserves, as well as internal and
external debt.
Corporate taxation data are taken from the International Bureau of Fiscal Documenta-
tion, and from surveys provided by the tax advisory companies Ernst&Young, PwC,
and KPMG. The statutory tax rate variable contains statutory profit-tax rates mod-
ified by applicable restrictions on interest deductions. The data covers a group of 79
countries in a period of nine years from 1996 until 2004.
