Anemia is prevalent among African American children. When evaluating pediatric patients for
anemia, clinicians refer to the normative hematological reference values in reference text-
books. These reference values are used in spite of evidence that healthy African American peo-
ple of all ages have average hemoglobin concentrations from 0.5 to 0.73 g/dl below those of
Whites. In an earlier study, using samples from 2,161 healthy African American children from
2 to 18 years old, we found a statistically significant difference (P < 0.0001) in the mean hemo-
globin value for each age group as compared to reference normative mean hemoglobin values.
Here we present the results of a comparative analysis of the data set from our previous study
and the data set from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys III (NHANES III)
1988­1994. We found no statistically significant difference between these data sets with
respect to the hemoglobin values for any age or sex group, confirming that African American
children and adolescents have lower mean hemoglobin values than do Whites. Use of the refer-
ence hemoglobin values presented here will help prevent the misdiagnosis of anemia in African
American children and thereby minimize unnecessary hematological workups and treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Anemia is one of the most common abnormalities
encountered by general pediatricians. The causes of ane-
mia during childhood and adolescence are well known.
In 1979, Dallman and Siimes [1] established percentile
curves for hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume
for children between 5 and 16 years of age based on a
large sample of white children of nonindigent parents.
By design, these authors gathered information from
9,946 \White children," only making reference to the
fact that the hemoglobin concentrations would have
been lower if \Blacks" had been included in the survey.
When evaluating pediatric patients for anemia, clini-
cians usually check their suspicion of this disorder by re-
ferring to the normative hematological reference values
for children and adolescents in reference textbooks, such
as that by Nathan and Oski [2]. These standard refer-
ence values are uniformly used for all racial and ethnic
groups. They are used in spite of evidence in the medical
literature, originating as far back as 1930, that healthy
people of all ages who are of African extraction have av-
erage hemoglobin concentrations ranging from 0.5 to
0.73 g/dl below those of Whites, independent of statisti-
cal matching, and controlled for selected variables,
including iron deficiency, age, sex, hemoglobinopathies,
and socioeconomic factors [3,4].
A review of the medical literature over the past few
decades suggests that African Americans have lower
baseline hemoglobin concentrations than do Whites.
Differences in socioeconomic status or iron deficiency
and other causes of anemia do not account for this dif-
ference [5­7]. Anemia remains common among African
American children, having been identified as one of the
five most prevalent conditions in this population [8].
According to the Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance 2002
report [9], 19.3% of black children were diagnosed with
anemia between 1993 and 2002. The same report stated
that while anemia has continued to decline since the

1980's, it has declined least among African American
and Asian or Pacific Islander children. Studies done in
the 1960's attributed lower hematological values in Afri-
can Americans to diet and nutritional status but this has
since been disproved [10]. Nduka et al. [11] compared
hematologic indices of 512 Africans and 196 Caucasians
residing in the same Nigerian town and found marked
differences between the two groups, with Caucasians
having higher hemoglobin levels. The hemoglobin val-
ues for African women, in particular, were much lower
than those previously reported, but the authors made no
mention of diet, living conditions, or hygiene as possible
causes of this difference. The National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey II (NHANES II), 1976­
1980 [12], not only confirmed racial differences in mean
hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, with African Ameri-
cans having consistently lower mean values than those
of Whites, but also found that those differences were
independent of gender, age, poverty status, or nutrition,
although there was some variation with age. This survey
provided clinicians and researchers with suggested refer-
ence ranges for specific population subgroups.
In a previous study [13], we obtained samples from
3,000 healthy African American children, 2­18 years
old. These children were from three independent pedi-
atric practices in Manhattan, a borough of New York
City. These practices have a service area spanning
Central and East Harlem, Morningside Heights,
Washington Heights, and the Upper West Side, areas
having high populations of African Americans. In its
methodology, this study addressed some of the limita-
tions of earlier studies. The methodology included a
complete dietary history and excluded individuals
with iron deficiency, b thalassemia trait, and sus-
pected a thalassemia trait. Adolescent patients were
subcategorized by age and sex to account for the
effects of both maturation and sex on hemoglobin lev-
els. Of the 3,000 samples collected, 839 were excluded
because of patients' nutritional history, iron defi-
ciency, or the presence of thalassemia trait. Among
the remaining 2,161 samples, this study found a statis-
tically significant difference (P < 0.0001) in the mean
hemoglobin value for each age group when compared
to reference normative mean hemoglobin values.
These findings were consistent with previous reports
of significant racial differences in mean hemoglobin
values.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
To establish hematologic reference values for Afri-
can American children and adolescents, we performed
an analysis of two existing data sets. The first data
was from our previous study of a sample of 2,161
healthy African American children between the ages
of 2­18 years. The second and larger data set was
obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Surveys III (NHANES III) 1988­1994 [14],
which contained data from 33,994 individuals 2 months
old and older with subsamples of White (n ¼ 6,321),
Mexican American (n ¼ 3,616), other Hispanic (n ¼
313), and African American (n ¼ 3,593). The NHANES
III data files were organized in a manner suitable for
comparative analysis. We used the subsample of chil-
dren and adolescents of ages 2­18 years from the
NHANES III subsample. Of the 3,593 African Ameri-
can children, 2,878 were of the appropriate age for
this analysis.
The number of African American children from the
NHANES III study, 2,878, was comparable to the 2,161
African American children in our study. Mean hemoglo-
bin and hematocrit values for each ethnic group were
extracted from the NHANES III data files with the
appropriate statistical analysis software (SAS) code. The
mean hemoglobin values for non-Hispanic Whites from
the NHANES III subsample was compared to the mean
hemoglobin values from the NHANES III African
American subsample using Students T-test. These data
files were sorted into groups as in our previous study: 2­
5 years, 6­10 years, 11­15 years, and 16­18 years, with
data from those over the age of 10 years also sorted into
male and female groups.
We compared the NHANES III subsample of he-
moglobin values for African American children and
adolescents to the data from our earlier study.
Because our data were collected from a single demo-
graphic area of the United States, they may not be
representative of all African Americans. The NHANES
III study, in contrast, was a cross-sectional study and
is considered to be more representative of the United
States population.
RESULTS
Statistically significant differences in hemoglobin
values were found between all age and sex groups
(Table I). The mean hemoglobin values from the
NHANES III subsample of non-Hispanic Whites
were similar to the published reference standards cur-
rently available. Comparing the data for African
Americans from the NHANES III study group and
our own study group, we found no statistically signifi-
cant differences in mean hemoglobin by age and sex
group (Table II). This finding confirmed that African
American children and adolescents have lower mean
hemoglobin values than do Whites. The similarity in
all age and sex groups of the mean hemoglobin values
for the two study groups demonstrates that the sam-
ples used in our analysis were indeed representative of
African American children and adolescents. We deter-
mined normative hemoglobin values based on the
similar mean hemoglobin values of the two studies.

DISCUSSION
According to the 2004 U.S. census, African Ameri-
cans make up 12.3% of the country's population.
African American children represent an even higher
proportion of the pediatric population in the United
States, accounting, according to the 2004 census, for
16.5% of children less than 5 years of age [15].
The purpose of establishing the normative values for
African American children and adolescents is not to cre-
ate confusion for general pediatricians, but to emphasize
the fact that hemoglobin values vary by ethnicity. With
the ethnic diversity of the United States and its ever-
changing demographic patterns, practitioners need to be
aware of how ethnicity and mixed ethnicity can influence
what may be considered a normal hemoglobin value.
These new reference values are intended to be used only
as guidelines; they are not designed to replace good clini-
cal judgment and appropriate hematological workups.
However, this newly developed reference table does pro-
vide documentation and a quick reference source for the
racial differences in hemoglobin values between African
American children and adolescents and non-Hispanic
White children of the same ages.
Although this information has been available in the
NHANES database for years, and although the medi-
cal literature has, for decades, clearly demonstrated
that normal hemoglobin values differ between African
Americans and non-Hispanic Whites, a reference
database for African Americans has never before
been developed. Table III shows the normative hema-
tological values for African American children of the
ages of 2­18 years.

CONCLUSIONS
These guidelines presented here, which present
mean hemoglobin concentrations and À2 std values
for age and gender, will help pediatricians evaluate
anemia in African American children. With the costs
and restrictions of present-day health care, unneces-
sary anemia evaluation and treatment should be
avoided. These guidelines will not only identify
patients who need additional anemia evaluation, but
also prevent the misdiagnosis of anemia in African
American children and adolescents.
