conservative treatments for
idiopathic clubfoot: Ponseti's
versus non-Ponseti's
methods
Jin-Peng He1, Jing Fan Shao1 and Yun Hao2
Abstract
Objective: Various methods are applied in the clinical treatment of idiopathic clubfoot.
The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of different conservative treatments.
Methods: Studies were pooled and odds ratio (ORs) with corresponding confidence intervals
were calculated for evaluation of the results, relapses, and requirement for major surgery.
Results: A final analysis of 1435 patients from 9 eligible studies was performed. The combined OR
indicated that significantly more fair and poor results were achieved and that major surgery was
required significantly more often when using non-Ponseti's methods (OR ¼ 3.33 and OR ¼ 7.32,
respectively), but no significant difference was detected in the occurrence of relapse (OR ¼ 1.34).
Pooled OR evaluation showed a significantly higher rate of fair and poor results, relapse, and
requirement for major surgery when using Kite's method than when using Ponseti's method
(OR ¼ 3.93, OR ¼ 2.53, and OR ¼ 3.19, respectively), but no significant difference was detected
between the French method and Ponseti's method (OR ¼ 3.01, OR ¼ 0.72, and OR ¼ 1.26,
respectively).
Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicates that Ponseti's method is safe and efficient for
conservative treatment of clubfoot and decreases the number of surgical interventions required.
It is recommended as the first-choice conservative treatment for idiopathic clubfoot.

Introduction
Idiopathic clubfoot is a severe congenital
paediatric orthopaedic deformity that may
lead to a handicapped status, an inability of
the patient to pursue his or her vocation,
and claudication when treatment is delayed
or neglected.1 Treatments involving splints,
physical therapy, and corrective casts have
been widely used, but these conservative
treatments have been replaced by surgical
operations such as soft tissue release during
the past several decades.2,3 For many years,
extensive and complex operations were the
major management techniques for clubfoot,
but the long-term results were not excel-
lent,2,3 and surgical release procedures were
used to lengthen the tight soft tissues on the
medial and posterior aspects of the club-
foot.4 Excellent results were not achieved
until Ponseti introduced a novel casting
method with which to correct the forefoot
adduction, hindfoot varus, equinus, and
cavus in patients with clubfoot. The classic
surgical correction of clubfoot has been
abolished because the resultant poor func-
tion and painful foot were thought to be a
result of the surgical procedure itself,5 and
such treatment has been replaced by
Ponseti's method.6
Ponseti's method is a nonsurgical tech-
nique that has been extensively proven to be
safer and more efficient than surgery for the
treatment of clubfoot.7,8 Ponseti's method is
now widely recommended as the gold stand-
ard for treatment of idiopathic clubfoot, and
it has been approved on a worldwide basis.
Although some other methods are still
widely applied in the clinical setting, such
as Kite's method and the French method,9
few studies have compared the effects of
these different conservative treatment
methods for clubfoot, and no definitive con-
clusions have been reached. The purpose of
this study was to determine whether Ponseti's
method is the most efficient technique in the
conservative treatment of congenital idio-
pathic clubfoot based on a meta-analysis of
the current scientific literature.
Methods
Search strategy
Embase, Medicine, PubMed, and Web of
Science were searched from an undefined
beginning time point to 19 December 2016.
The following search terms were used:
``clubfoot,'' ``Ponseti,'' and ``treatment'';
((clubfoot) AND treatment) AND Ponseti).
References of included articles and reviews
were also manually investigated to avoid
omission. In cases of duplication, the most
recent or complete study was included. This
meta-analysis was performed according to
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
statement criteria.
Two independent reviewers assessed the
eligibility of the studies by reviewing the
titles and abstracts. The inclusion criteria
were as follows:1 conservative treatment of
patients with clubfoot,2 comparison between
Ponseti's method and at least one non-
Ponseti's method,3 publication in English,4
and enough data to calculate the odds ratio
(OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The
exclusion criteria were as follows:1 similar
studies including the same patients and2 lack
of comparison between those similar studies.
Statistical analysis
ORs were calculated to compare Ponseti's
method and non-Ponseti's methods.
Heterogeneity between the studies was
considered statistically significant if the
P value was <0.10; heterogeneity was also
quantified using the I2 metric (I2 ¼ 0%, no
heterogeneity; I2 < 25%, low heterogeneity;
He et al. 1191
I2 ¼ 25%­50%, moderate heterogeneity;
and I2 > 50%, strong heterogeneity).10­12 If
heterogeneity was present, we used a
random-effects model instead of a fixed-
effects model.12,13 All P values were two-
sided. Review Manager (RevMan) software
version 5.2 (The Cochrane Collaboration,
The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen,
Denmark) was used for this meta-analysis.
Results
In total, 422 studies were identiEed using
the research strategy (Figure 1). Of these,
413 conference abstracts, editorials, studies
on unrelated topics, duplicate studies, or
studies involving comparison with an oper-
ation method were excluded. Therefore, 9
studies14­22 involving a total of 1435 patients
were included in this meta-analysis (Table 1).
Non-Ponseti's methods versus Ponseti's
method
Five studies involving a total of 973 feet
treated with conservative methods were
meta-analysed. Because of severe heterogen-
eity (I2 ¼ 78%), a random-effects model was
selected for the analysis. The pooled OR
was 3.33 (95% CI, 1.34­8.27; Z ¼ 2.59;
P ¼ 0.010), illustrating that non-Ponseti's
methods resulted in more fair and poor
correction results than did Ponseti's method
(P ¼ 0.010) (Figure 2(a)).
Five studies involving a total of 971 feet
treated with conservative methods were
meta-analysed. A random-effects model
was selected for the analysis because severe
heterogeneity was detected (I2 ¼ 80%). The
pooled OR was 1.34 (95% CI, 0.61­2.95;
Z ¼ 0.73), illustrating that no significant
difference in relapse was present between
non-Ponseti's methods and Ponseti's method
(Figure 2(b)).
Eight studies involving a total of 1274 feet
treated with conservative methods were
meta-analysed. Due to severe heterogeneity
(I2 ¼ 93%), a random-effects model was
selected for the analysis. The pooled OR
was 7.32 (95% CI, 1.85­29.02; Z ¼ 2.83;
P ¼ 0.005), illustrating that more operations
with the exception of Achilles tenotomy

were needed after non-Ponseti's method
than after Ponseti's method (P ¼ 0.005)
(Figure 2(c)).
Kite's method versus Ponseti's method
The rates of poor and fair results, relapse,
and requirement for additional operations
were investigated in three studies. The
results showed that there were signiEcant
differences in all three factors between Kite's
method and Ponseti's method (Figure 3). All
three rates were significantly lower with
Ponseti's method than with Kite's method.
(P < 0.05) (Figure 3).
French method versus Ponseti's
method
The rates of poor and fair results, relapse,
and requirement for additional operations
were investigated in two studies. The results
showed that there were no signiEcant differ-
ences in any of these three factors between
the French method and Ponseti's method
(Figure 4).
Discussion
Clubfoot, termed congenital talipes equino-
varus, is a complex paediatric foot deformity
with an incidence of about 1 in every 1000
births.23 It is characterized by three-
dimensional deformities such as forefoot
adductus, midfoot cavus, hindfoot varus,
and ankle equinus. Several surgical tech-
niques (soft tissue release, arthrodesis) have
been used to correct clubfoot in the past few
decades. However, conservative treatment
(physiotherapy, casts, and braces) is cur-
rently considered the most effective method
and has been widely accepted by paediatric
orthopaedic surgeons. Surgically treated
clubfoot may be associated with many
complications, including scar contracture,
neurovascular injury, wound infection, and
limb length discrepancy. Although conser-
vative treatment is generally considered a

good choice, treatment of clubfoot in its
advanced stages remains challenging for
paediatric orthopaedic surgeons. This
meta-analysis suggests that the application
of Ponseti's method appears to yield a lower
likelihood of the need for major clubfoot
surgery. Although we found no signiEcant
difference in relapse between Ponseti's
method and non-Ponseti's methods, this
meta-analysis of data from eight compara-
tive studies showed that Ponseti's method is
superior to non-Ponseti's methods with
respect to better results and less need for
additional operations.
Laaveg and Ponseti4 claimed that 89% of
patients who underwent treatment using
Ponseti's method required no additional
major surgical operations. Cooper and
Dietz24 reported that 78% of patients had
an excellent or good functional prognosis in a
retrospective study with a 30-year follow-up
period after treatment by Ponseti's method.
Although Ponseti's method is extensively
recommended and has become widely used,
this is the first meta-analysis to compare non-
Ponseti's methods with Ponseti's method and
the first meta-analysis to compare Ponseti's
method and the French method.
Clubfoot was historically treated by a
nonoperative casting method introduced by
Kite.19,25 The reported success rates were
unsatisfactory, ranging from 11% to 58%.19
The present meta-analysis showed signiEcant
differences in the correction, relapse, and
operation rates between Kite's method and
Ponseti's method (Figure 3). All three factors
were significantly lower with Ponseti's
method than with Kite's method (P< 0.05)
(Figure 3). Moreover, the treatment duration
was longer with Kite's method than with
Ponseti's method,14­16 and the need for
casting was higher with Kite's method than
with Ponseti's method14,15 (Table 1).
Considering all of these findings, Ponseti's
method is a more effective conservative
treatment technique than Kite's method for
idiopathic clubfoot.
Functional treatment, also known as
French physiotherapy, was described by
Paul Masse in the 1970s and subsequently
developed by several different paediatric
orthopaedic surgeons.18,26 The general phil-
osophy is very progressive and gradual
correction by daily manipulation; various
elements of the deformity are corrected
separately and in a speciEc order.18 In
contrast to Ponseti's method, a wide variety
of results have been reported with French
functional treatment.26­28 The complexity
and duration of the French method might
account for this greater variation in out-
comes. The technical skill and experience of
the physiotherapist are major factors for
successful treatment of clubfoot. A gait
analysis of patients treated with the French
method and Ponseti's method was per-
formed.29 The joint range of motion in the
sagittal plane was better after the French
method (65%) than after Ponseti's method
(45%). However, the present meta-analysis
showed no signiEcant difference between
Ponseti's method and French functional
therapy in terms of the correction, relapse,
and need for additional operations.
Ponseti's method has been widely
accepted as a conservative treatment regi-
men because of the reported good results
during long-term follow-up. The present
meta-analysis showed that Ponseti's
method avoided major surgery in an average
of 84.9% patients among different institu-
tions, succeed in an average of 75.6%
patients among different institutions, and
achieved an excellent or good functional
prognosis in an average of 91.1% patients
among different institutions. However,
better correction and a lower relapse rate
are still desired. Brace application is a useful
method for preventing relapse after correc-
tion. Noncompliance with or nonadherence
to the brace protocol has been considered
the predominant risk factor for relapse of
clubfoot, which is still a challenging
problem.9
He et al. 1197
The differences in bracing and the dur-
ation of follow-up among different studies
could have contributed to the differences in
the reported results; the importance of bra-
cing in Ponseti's method was widely high-
lighted, and the number of relapses with
surgical indications increased as the follow-
up period progressed.30 An objective measure
of clubfoot severity, such as the Dimeglio
score, was not available in each study
included in this meta-analysis. The overall
severity of clubfoot treated may have differed
among the different methods, thereby con-
founding the results. Additionally, Achilles
tenotomy was commonly performed among
the studies included in this meta-analysis.
Thus, Achilles tenotomy also should have
been considered a factor affecting the thera-
peutic efficacy for clubfoot.
Some limitations of this meta-analysis
should be noted. First, the heterogeneity was
quite high in this meta-analysis. The above-
mentioned characteristics may make the
pooled results less reliable. Second, some
biases may have been introduced because
studies in languages other than English were
excluded. Thus, we could not perform a
uniform analysis from the quite different
results.
This meta-analysis has shown that
Ponseti's method can be successfully used
to correct idiopathic clubfoot and is the
most effective of all conservative methods.
Ponseti's method is a safe, efficient conser-
vative treatment method for clubfoot and
decreases the number of surgical interven-
tions required.
