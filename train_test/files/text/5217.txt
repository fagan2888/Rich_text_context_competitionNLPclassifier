Introduction
Recent studies in the field of developmental psychology
have led to an increasing interest in mental health and early
identification of mental disorders in the school-aged popula-
tion (Ahlen, Breitholtz, Barrett, & Gallegos, 2012; Alesi,
Rappo, & Pepi, 2014). To date, insufficient literature has
been produced addressing the study of this issue in children
with borderline intellectual functioning (BIF) and gifted
intellectual functioning (GIF). Nevertheless, in spite of their
high occurrence, these two intellectual conditions are under-
treated and often misinterpreted. They hold heterogeneous
groups of children showing some similarities, despite their
apparent contrasting nature given by slowness in BIF and
precocity in GIF.
First, an ample variety of names is used to label participants
falling into these two groups. More clearly, children with BIF
are often labeled slow learners or backward learners (Vianello,
2008). Similarly, gifted intellectual children are called chil-
dren with high intellectual functioning or intellectual "precoc-
ity," high-level potentialities, or talented children.
This overlapping of linguistic labels underlies complex
theoretical and methodological issues. We argue that these
terms cannot be assumed as synonymous, because they differ
in meaningful ways. For example, the expression BIF refers
to a condition of boundary between typical and atypical
intellectual level, while the expression slow learners taps the
long time spent in acquiring school skills or to complete
achievement tasks. Similarly, gifted and talented children are
not terms to be used interchangeably; giftedness indicates an
aptitude in a specific domain (e.g., music, art, athletics, writ-
ing . . . ), while talent denotes the result of the giftedness
(Majid & Alias, 2010).
Second, other similarities between the two intellectual
conditions can be found in their underestimated occurrence,

Emotional Profile and Intellectual
Functioning: A Comparison Among
Children With Borderline Intellectual
Functioning, Average Intellectual
Functioning, and Gifted Intellectual
Functioning

Abstract
Insufficient literature has been produced addressing children with borderline intellectual functioning (BIF) and gifted intellectual
functioning (GIF). The goal of this work is to compare levels of self-esteem, depression, anxiety at school, and insecurity
among children with BIF and GIF, and a control group of average intellectual functioning (AIF). There were participants of
104 children (fourth grade of primary school). Analyses revealed that children with BIF showed a lower level of self-esteem
and higher levels of depression and school anxiety. Moreover, our findings highlight the co-occurrence of school anxiety,
depressed mood, and insecurity among the BIF and AIF groups. One of the issues that emerge from this study is the need
to implement prevention programs aimed at identifying children with lower or higher levels of intellectual functioning. These
findings highlight the importance of establishing what the most appropriate educational and clinical interventions are in
reducing the risks of mental disorders in this population.

which is largely based prevalently on their IQ values. BIF
can be commonly identified as scoring between one and two
standard deviations below the IQ mean (range = 70-85) and
has a prevalence of 13.6% in the general population.
However, this rate decreases to 7% assuming the adaptive
functioning as required by the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5; American
Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). " . . . differentiating
borderline intellectual functioning and mild intellectual dis-
ability (intellectual developmental disorder) requires careful
assessment of intellectual and adaptive functions and their
discrepancies, particularly in the presence of co-occurring
mental disorders that may affect patient compliance with
standardized testing procedures."
Moreover, the main features appear to be the delay and
the slowness in the acquisition of motor and cognitive com-
petences. Specifically, children with BIF show late informa-
tion processing abilities, narrow working memory capacity,
limited executive functioning, and selective-attention prob-
lems (Ninivaggi, 2001; Schuchardt, Gebhardt, & Maehler,
2010). Social abilities such as perspective taking and the
interpretation of social situations are particularly impaired.
The cause of this impairment would seem to be an inade-
quate system of Social Information Processing (SIP) closely
linked to the slowness in selective attention, decreased work-
ing memory capacity, and increased inhibition processes
(Van Nieuwenhuijzen, Vriens, Scheepmakerc, Smitc, &
Porton, 2011).
However, Gifted Intellectual Children commonly score
two standard deviations over the IQ mean (more than 130)
and have a prevalence of 2.3% in the general population.
Revol and Bléandonu (2012) outlined the profile of these
children and have identified nine behavioral characteristics:
variety of interests, extraordinary curiosity, persistence in
front of difficulties, creativity or divergent thinking, leader-
ship, overdeveloped language abilities, high emotional com-
petences, sensitivity, and sense of justice. On the whole,
these children show quicker development in one or more
areas: physical, cognitive, linguistic, and social (Gur, 2011).
Gifted children are often described as intrusive and full of
energy; from early childhood, they are very curious, inquisi-
tive, and keen to discuss concepts of their interest and create
extensive descriptions. Moreover, they produce their first
words and sentences very early on, subsequently mastering a
broad vocabulary; they use their language in a creative way,
and they produce complex sentences, making up stories, and
are able to understand symbolic or abstract meanings. Often,
these children dislike cooperating with their chronological-
age peers because they do not share similar interests.
Consequently, they prefer working alone or with older chil-
dren and adults (Smutny, 2000).
Third, the elevated co-occurrence between the above-
described intellectual conditions and school complaints such
as learning disabilities (LD) and attention deficit hyperactiv-
ity disorders (ADHD; Vianello, 2008) is worth noting.
Ample evidence has been found associating BIF and LDs,
especially dyslexia. This comorbidity paradoxically seems to
contrast the diagnosis criterion of exclusion of impaired
intellectual level in children with LD. However, a close asso-
ciation between the two conditions has been postulated by
Vianello (2014), who argued that the comorbidity of BIF and
LD is 1 each 408 to 571 pupils on the basis of the guidelines
of Consensus Conference (AA.VV., 2009). Karande,
Kanchan, and Kulkarni (2008) documented the academic
history of 55 children with BIF and have found high rates of
comorbidity with poor school performance (89.1%) and dif-
ficulties in writing (92.7%) and mathematics (76.4%). This
is consistent with results of Fernell and Ek (2010) who
focused a great amount of academic difficulties, namely, the
struggle to cope with school tasks and classroom demands,
conduct disorders, and externalizing symptoms associated
with lower levels of inhibition. Through analyzing this issue
in depth, several possible explanations for the comorbidity of
BIF and LD can be hypothesized. First, an impaired process-
ing speed can be identified as a main factor that limits "the
amount of information that can be processed in a given time
interval" with longer reaction times (RTs) in cognitive tasks
and slower performance in intellectual tasks (Bonifacci &
Snowling, 2007). Second, the delayed cognitive develop-
ment and information processing characterizing the BIF cre-
ates memory or selective-attention problems, which in turn
compromise the capacity to successfully acquire school
capacities (Van Nieuwenhuijzen et al., 2011).
Moreover, epidemiological studies have revealed in chil-
dren and adolescents with BIF high rates of ADHD ranging
between 20% and 30% as well as behavioral problems about
58.2% (Karande et al., 2008).
However, the association between giftedness and LDs has
been controversial (Kirmani, Al-Kadi, Iftikhar, & Mayat,
2014; Majid & Alias, 2010). In his recent review, Vaivre-
Douret (2011) analyzed factors involved in the neuropsycho-
logical and psychopathological etiology of LDs in high-level
potentialities children. The first factors included written lan-
guage disorders such as dyslexia, spelling difficulties,
dyscalculia, and dysgraphia. The second factors embraced
underperforming, psycho-affective immaturity, anxiety, and
behavioral fluctuations. The author therefore argued how the
typical precocity of this population could make these chil-
dren more vulnerable in developing LDs because it consents
to use compensation strategies, which, in turn, mask eventual
learning difficulties and make difficult the diagnosis in
highly gifted children.
A certain number of studies reported the comorbidity
between giftedness and ADHD (Bénony, Van Der Elst,
Chahraoui, Bénony, & Marnier, 2007; Karande et al., 2008;
Kirmani et al., 2014). Specifically, multiple and contradic-
tory causes have been identified in this population: (a) the
typical motor instability associated with hyperactivity and
impulsivity, (b) boredom in the classroom due to out-of-ordi-
nary intellectual capacities determining a higher processing
Alesi et al. 3
speed, (c) the quickness to complete school tasks before
classmates, and (d) the affective development and relational
difficulties with peers (Revol & Bléandonu, 2012).
Fourth, a variety of authors documented children with
BIF as a population at high risk of mental health disorders
(Cooper, Smiley, Morrison, Williamson, & Allan, 2007;
Einfeld et al., 2006: Emerson & Hatton, 2007). It has been
demonstrated that a large number of children with BIF are
more likely to show higher rates of anxiety and depression as
well as developing neurotic and personality disorders as
opposed to typically developing peers (Emerson, Einfeld, &
Stancliffe, 2010; Fernell & Ek, 2010).
Anxiety disorders are considered the most prevalent men-
tal impairments in typical and atypical children (Kozina,
2014). Anxiety is a discomfort reaction associated with
unpleasant emotions and a state of distress occurring in
response to situations or tasks that are perceived as threaten-
ing to self-worth (Pereira, Barros, & Mendonça, 2012).
Moreover, anxiety disorders are frequently in comorbidity
with depressive symptoms with rates ranging from 16% to
50% increasing in chronicity and severity (Jacobson &
Newman, 2014). A common core of high negative affects is
the leading cause of this comorbidity. The consequence is the
interference with daily functioning for a sizable population
of children (Cooper et al., 2007; Wright, Banerjee, Hoek,
Rieffe, & Novin, 2010). However, scholars and practitioners
agree that natural concerns clearly follow developmental
waves during the growth. Fears regarding separation anxiety
decrease during early childhood, whereas fears about school
and school anxiety increase during later childhood (Grills-
Taquechel, Fletcher, Vaughn, & Stuebing, 2012). So school
anxiety is the most frequent fear occurring during school
age. It describes a discomfort reaction associated with
unpleasant emotions and a state of distress occurring in
response to situations involving school learning tasks that
are perceived as threatening to self-worth.
At this age, the close relationship between depressive
symptoms and anxiety is largely reinforced by lower levels
of school self-esteem (Bernaras, Jaureguizar, Soroa, Ibabe,
& Cuevas, 2011). Karande et al. (2008) explain this loss of
self-esteem by claiming the significant emotional distress
linked to difficulties in school, social, or vocational compe-
tences. Often, lower levels of school self-esteem are associ-
ated to poor achievement at school. Specifically, higher
achievers are more likely to develop positive school emo-
tions and affects, which, in turn, reinforce their engagement
and motivation in school activities, while students with
school underachievement are more likely to show lower
global self-esteem and to report increasing anxious and
depressive symptomatology.
Similarly, gifted children were reported to be highly vul-
nerable in developing mental health disorders. From a devel-
opmental perspective, this risk already manifested during
childhood may grow and become significant in
adolescence; gifted adolescents often show anxiety and
depressive symptoms associated with inhibition and academic
disinvestment as well as immature affective development and
relational difficulties with their peers. In turn, distress and
anxiety reinforce a loss of interest in learning by creating intel-
lectual inhibition and refuse to cope with challenging tasks
(Vaivre-Douret, 2011). Mood and conduct disorders are the
direct consequence of this situation (Bénony et al., 2007;
Guénolé et al., 2013). As Majid and Alias (2010) state "ironi-
cally, the gift does not only bring joy and happiness, but it also
brings with it danger, anxiety and disappointment" (p. 63).
Moreover, giftedness can become a limit if the gap between
cognitive and emotional development is too wide. This may
lead to the phenomenon "Shattered Idealism," which is char-
acterized by a negative self-awareness and maladaptive moti-
vational profile, which has an effect on disruptive behaviors
(Alesi, Rappo, & Pepi, 2012; Blakeley, 2001).
Given the literature findings and speculative interpreta-
tions, comparisons of ratings of depression, school anxiety,
insecurity, and self-esteem at school endorsed by pupils with
different levels of intellectual functioning (BIF, AIF, GIF
groups) were assessed. In particular, the following hypothe-
ses will be tested in this research:
Hypothesis 1: The intellectual functioning, in our sam-
ple, would follow a normal distribution with the majority
of children showing an average level of intellectual
functioning.
Hypothesis 2: Pupils with AIF would have higher scores
on self-esteem at school and lower levels of school anxi-
ety, depressed mood, and insecurity than pupils with BIF
and GIF.
Hypothesis 3: The correlations of rated school self-
esteem, anxiety, depressed mood, and insecurity would be
statistically significant and would be shown by all the
three groups.
Method
Participants
Participants were 104 non-clinical children whose mean age
was 9.5 years (range = 8.7-9.9 years). With regard to sex,
there were 35 female and 69 male participants. They were
selected from a sample of 265 pupils on the basis of their
level of intelligence. All children were attending fourth
grade of the primary school and fell into three groups on the
basis of level of intelligence: (a) BIF, (b) AIF, and (c) GIF.
The BIF group was composed of 25 children, aged 9.6
(range = 8.8-9.9 years), with Raven's scores lower than 15
percentile and mental age greater than 8 years. The AIF
group was composed of 62 children aged 9.4 (range = 8.7-
9.7 years), with Raven's scores from 35 to 75 percentile.
Finally, the GIF group was composed of 17 children aged
9.4 (range = 8.9-9.5 years), with Raven's scores higher
than 88.

Prior to the start of the study, written informed consent
was provided by each participant's parents. Moreover, appro-
priate local ethics committee approval was obtained from the
University of Palermo.
Materials
Raven's Progressive Matrices. The Raven's (2008) Progressive
Matrices were administered to measure general intelligence.
This test evaluates the development of logical thinking.
Given a matrix of geometric shapes, children were required
to select the correct missing shape among a set of items. For
each item, evaluation was binary, with a score of 1 being
attributed to each correct item, and 0 to incorrect items.
OL test. The Organizzazioni Logiche (OL; Vianello & Marin,
1997) test was administered to determine mental age of the
participants. The OL test consists of 18 items subdivided into
three areas of logical operation (ordering, numbering, and
classification). Evaluation was binary for each item, with a
mark of 1 being attributed to each correct item and 0 to each
incorrect item. The raw data thus obtained were then trans-
formed into a measure of mental age (range = 4-8 years)
using appropriate conversion tables. The OL test shows good
validity, with a .68 correlation with Wechsler Intelligence
Scale and a.78 correlation with the Columbia Mental Matu-
rity Scale. The reliability of the OL test is .87.
School self-esteem.The Test Multidimensionale Autostima
(TMA)­Multidimensional Test of Self-Esteem, realized by
Bracken (1992), was used to measure self-esteem at school.
This test assesses the global self-worth by means of six dif-
ferent scales of self-esteem (Social, Competence, Affect,
School, Family, and Physical).
The administration was individual. In particular, for our
research, we used the scale to evaluate the school self-
esteem. This scale consisted of 25 items, positive and nega-
tive, related to the way pupils feel about themselves in the
school domain. Participants were asked to express their level
of agreement with statements such as I am proud of my
schoolwork or I do not understand much what I read. Each
item was presented on a 4-point Likert-type scale from abso-
lutely true to absolutely false. The test­retest reliability of
the battery was r = .90.
School anxiety.Self Administrated Psychiatric Scales for
Children and Adolescents (SAFA) was an Italian test
(Cianchetti & Fancello, 2001) aimed at assessing mental
impairments in children and adolescents with age ranging
from 8 to 18 years.
Specifically, SAFA was a battery that consisted of six
scales, subdivided in subscales, suitable to be administrated
separately. The scales were Anxiety (SAFA A), Depression
(SAFA D), Obsessive­Compulsive Symptoms (SAFA O),
Somatic Symptoms and Hypochondria (SAFA S), Phobias
(SAFA F), and Psychogenic Eating Disorders (SAFA P).
Moreover, each scale consisted of two versions suitable
for participants aged 8 to 10 years and 11 to 18 years.
Each item was scored from 0 to 2.
In our study, SAFA A and SAFA D were administered.
The first measured the school anxiety, with 12 items, such as
When I go to school I often feel very nervous. The second
measured the depressed mood, with six items, such as I often
feel sad without any reason, and the insecurity, with six
items, such as I am sure of myself.
Each item was presented on a 3-point scale from true to false.
The test­retest reliability of the battery was r = .90.
Procedure
At the beginning of the research, a screening was done on all
fourth graders from two public schools located in quarters of
medium socioeconomic level. The screening was carried out
in 3 months. All children were assessed with the Raven's
Progressive Matrices to evaluate their level of intellectual
functioning. To evaluate mental age in BIF group, children
were assessed with the OL test.
All children with Raven's scores lower than 15 percentile
were administered with the OL test to identify their mental
age. Only the children who had a mental age greater than 8
were grouped with BIF.
All children with Raven's scores from 35 to 75 percentile
were grouped with AIF.
All children with Raven's scores higher than 88 were
grouped with GIF.
After the screening, 104 children were selected and subdi-
vided into 3 groups: group BIF (n = 25 pupils) characterized
by low level of intellectual functioning, group AIF (n = 62
pupils) characterized by average level of intellectual func-
tioning, group GIF (n = 17 pupils) characterized by high
level of intellectual functioning.
All children were administered School Self-Esteem,
School Anxiety, Depressed Mood, and Insecurity tests. The
order of presentation of the four tests was balanced.
The administration modality was individual, and it did not
last more than 25 min.
Results
The first goal of this study was to verify whether intellectual
functioning, in our sample, would follow a normal distribution.
The Levene's test revealed that the distribution of intel-
lectual functioning in our sample of 265 children with mean
age of 8.5 years was nearly normal (p < .001; see Table 1).
We found a nearly normative distribution in which most
pupils (66.03%) showed average levels of intellectual func-
tioning. Pupils with BIF were 15.47%, and pupils with high
intellectual functioning were 6.42%.
The second goal of this study aimed to investigate the
level of school self-esteem, school anxiety, depressed mood,
and insecurity in the three groups of children with different
levels of intellectual functioning (BIF, AIF, GIF groups).
Alesi et al. 5
To investigate this issue, a one-way ANOVA was per-
formed using the level of intellectual functioning as an inde-
pendent variable, while the dependent ones were school
self-esteem, school anxiety, depressed mood, and insecurity.
The one-way ANOVA was calculated. The level of signifi-
cance was set at p < .05. The SPSS software (Version 20 for
Windows) was used.
One-way results revealed significant differences for self-
esteem, F(2, 101) = 3.086, p = .05; school anxiety, F(2, 101)
= 4.341, p = .016; and depressed mood, F(2, 101) = 4.592, p
= .012. There were no significant differences for insecurity,
F(2, 101) = 1.019, p = .356.
After the application of Bonferroni post hoc test (p < .05),
we observed significant differences between the BIF group
and the GIF group. To be more precise, pupils with BIF
showed a lower level of self-esteem (M = 95.96) than pupils
with high intellectual functioning (M = 104.35).
With regard to the level of school anxiety, the analysis of
Bonferroni post hoc test (p < .05) revealed that the BIF group
(M = 55.12) showed higher level of school anxiety than the
AIF group (M = 46.97).
Finally, the BIF group (M = 49.68) revealed higher level
of depressed mood than the AIF group (M = 45.10) and the
GIF group (M = 44.53; see Table 2 for means and standard
deviations of self-esteem, school anxiety, depressed mood,
and insecurity by group).
Regarding the relationship between self-esteem, school
anxiety, depressed mood, and insecurity, our analysis showed
a significant positive correlation between school anxiety,
depressed mood, and insecurity, and a significant negative
correlation between school anxiety and school self-esteem
was found in the BIF and AIF groups.
We observed, also, a significant negative correlation
between insecurity and self-esteem, and a significant posi-
tive correlation between insecurity and depressed mood in
the GIF group (see Tables 3, 4, and 5 for correlations).
Discussion
This study set out to determine whether intellectual function-
ing would follow a normal distribution. We further extended
previous studies by examining simultaneously three levels of
intellectual functioning: (a) BIF, (b) AIF, and (c) GIF. We
choose to study two opposite intellectual conditions because
both BIF and GIF are often under-recognized and misdiag-
nosed (Revol & Bléandonu, 2012; Schuchardt et al., 2010).
Moreover, epidemiological research reveals that increasing
demands of contemporary society for higher levels of intel-
lectual functioning enable these groups to be at considerable
risk of psychopathology from early childhood. As a conse-
quence, we compared the emotional profile, composed by
the levels of self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and insecurity
among children with low, average, and high intellectual
functioning. First, we found a nearly normative distribution
in which the majority of children (66.03%) showed an aver-
age level of intellectual functioning, while a minority showed

a level of intellectual functioning below or above the median
IQ. Specifically, children with BIF were 15.47%, and chil-
dren with GIF were 6.42%. These rates are consistent with
other research, which found an occurrence for individuals
with BIF of about 12% to 13% in the general population if
we consider only the scores on the intelligence scales with-
out measures of adaptive functioning (Ninivaggi, 2001;
Vianello, 2008). Other studies report the prevalence of 2.3%
for intellectual gifted children in the general population
(Revol & Bléandonu, 2012).
Second, we found significant differences between our
three groups in the emotional profile. Children with BIF
showed the lowest level of self-esteem and, conversely, the
highest levels of school anxiety and depressed mood.
There are similarities between this emotional profile and
that described by previous work in this field highlighting how
low levels of school self-esteem and self-concept are com-
monly associated with intellectual functioning below the
median IQ (Bénony et al., 2007; Majid & Alias, 2010).
Individuals who experienced repeated failure, such as those
with BIF, are more likely to show higher rates of anxiety and
depression as well as to develop neurotic and personality dis-
orders as opposed to their typically developing peers
(Emerson et al., 2010; Fernell & Ek, 2010). When faced with
some perceived or real threats, novel or ambiguous events,
children with BIF are more likely to make cognitive errors or
distortions characterized by a negative bias in the interpreta-
tion of facts (Pereira et al., 2012). Moreover, anxiety disor-
ders are frequently associated with depressive symptoms with
rates ranging from 16% to 50% increasing in chronicity and
severity (Jacobson & Newman, 2014). The consequence is
the interference with daily functioning (Wright et al., 2010).
Nevertheless, gifted children show an emotional profile
characterized by significant higher self-esteem and lower
depression levels than children with BIF. This is in contrast
with previous studies, which underlie the close association
between the lack of school self-esteem and depressive disor-
ders in gifted children as the result of the asynchrony among
their cognitive and emotional abilities (Karande et al., 2008).
In the attempt to explain our result, we raise a developmental
issue. More precisely, this emotional profile in our group of
children with giftedness may be explained by the young age
of our participants. First, we hypothesize that deficits may
become increasingly evident over the time when the gap
between cognitive and emotional abilities increases and
environmental demands enhance. Second, if we consider the
changes in self-worth across the life span and the age trajec-
tory, self-esteem is generally quite elevated and not stable
during childhood (Pepi, Faria, & Alesi, 2006; Trzesniewski,
Donellan, & Robins, 2003).
Other findings to emerge from this research were the cor-
relations between the emotional variables. Consistent with
our third hypothesis, in the groups of pupils with BIF and
AIF, significant positive correlations between school anxi-
ety, depressed mood, and insecurity were observed. A possi-
ble explanation for this might be that anxiety and depression
regularly co-occur with rates ranging from 0.40 to 0.70 both
in clinical and non-clinical samples (Wright et al., 2010).
This comorbidity bases on common high negative feelings.A
lower intellectual functioning enhances the perception of
negative self-competence and increases negative affects such
as depressed mood, reduced pleasure and interest, irritability,
fatigue, and weakened concentration.
Conversely, school anxiety and school self-esteem were
negatively correlated. As mentioned by Bernaras et al.
(2011), lower levels of self-esteem reinforce the anxiety. In
other words, negative self-perception and self-worth increase
the discomfort reaction occurring in response to threatening
events. Taken together, these results indirectly suggest the
key role of environmental factors such as family and school
as sources of anxiety. Consistently, wide research shows that
negative parents'and teachers'behaviors or information pro-
vided to children are associated with increased fear and anxi-
ety. Specifically, the following factors have been found to
predict anxiety disorders in children: parents' or teachers'
anxiety, parents' or teachers' criticism and rejection, adults'
overcontrol and overprotection, insecure parent­child attach-
ment, and maladaptive parenting behaviors, parental warmth,
and family cohesion (Drake & Ginsburg, 2012).
No differences were found between children with BIF and
GIF. The reason for this might be related to the fact that the
development of negative thoughts and worries depends on
logical reasoning and elaborate decisional processes.
Therefore, we have to acknowledge that children with BIF
have an IQ level not significantly below the median IQ. It is
possible that, at this age, their intellectual level preserve their
perception and awareness of their own abilities. Moreover,
our results may be attributed to the age of participants and
need to be interpreted as evidence in favor of a linear increase
of risk to develop anxiety and depression symptoms by age.
In other words, the development of negative thoughts and
worries is not stable but increases over time and is largely
influenced by failure experiences that accumulate with
growth (Alesi et al., 2014).
Finally, in the GIF group, we found a significant negative
correlation between self-esteem and emotional insecurity as
well as a significant positive correlation between depressed
mood and insecurity. These findings were unexpected and
suggest the key role of family to influence the emotional pro-
file of these children. According to the Emotional Security
Theory (Cummings & Davies, 1996), children's emotional
insecurity is strongly influenced by environmental factors
such as family sense of protection and safety. Therefore, the
insecurity is more likely negatively associated with self-
esteem because it demonstrates the failure of the above-men-
tioned process aimed at maintaining the sense of safety and
security. This failure results in emotional dis-regulation
experiences and a negative worth of self. In turn, emotional
insecurity is designated as an explanatory mechanism for
internalizing and externalizing problems (Cummings,
Cheung, & Davies, 2013; Cummings, George, McCoy, &
Davies, 2010). It seems possible that the insecurity is related
Alesi et al. 7
to low self-esteem only in the GIF group given the typical
sensitivity and psycho-affective immaturity of these chil-
dren, which make them particularly sensitive to environmen-
tal claims.
However, it is interesting to note in all three groups of this
study the positive correlation between insecurity and
depressed mood. A possible explanation lies in the nature of
these emotional conditions sharing a common basis of nega-
tive feelings, which enables children at high risk of mental
disorders.
To sum up, it is crucial to acknowledge that future research
is needed to build on the shortcoming of this study. The most
important limitation lies in the fact that we did the assess-
ment of intellectual functioning only on the basis of the IQ.
A further study to assess both IQ and adaptive behaviors is
therefore recommended. Moreover, in future investigations,
it might be possible to investigate learning profiles of chil-
dren with low, average, and high intellectual functioning.
Another source of weakness in this study is the participants'
age ranging from 8.7 to 9.9 years. This range is small and not
necessarily representative of the population of Italian school-
children, a factor that may limit the generalizability of the
results. Additional research should extend the sample to
older students to assess our hypothesis that the gap between
intellectual and emotional functioning increases with age.
Nevertheless, challenges and future directions should
incorporate research that addresses issues concerning envi-
ronmental factors and also examine mechanisms mediating
family/school sources and children's temperamental vulner-
ability to develop maladaptive emotional profiles.
Despite this, our work provides support for the need of a
multifaceted approach of study considering simultaneously
intellectual and emotional functioning. To our knowledge,
the literature is lacking on the relationship between intellec-
tual levels, anxiety, and depression in school-age children.
This is an intriguing one, which could be usefully explored in
further research.
Implications
The evidence from this study suggests the importance of the
prevention programs aimed at identifying at an early age
high-risk cases showing increased levels of depression and
anxiety in children with lower or higher levels of intellectual
functioning. These programs would result in positive signifi-
cant effects to limit or reduce anxious or depressive behav-
iors and to prevent mental health problems or personality
dysfunctions in adulthood (Allison, Nativio, Mitchell, Ren,
& Yuhasz, 2014; Cuijpers, Van Straten, Smits, & Smit, 2006;
Jacobson & Newman, 2014). Generally, the intervention pro-
grams aim to train coping and problem-solving strategies to
face controllable and uncontrollable problems and reduce the
risk of high anxiety by favoring the self-regulation and the
management of stressful school situations. Indeed, school is
the ideal context to provide preventive interventions to a
large number of children before a disorder occurs in full
scale. One of the most valued preventive programs is the
FRIENDS for Life program. It is a short cognitive-behav-
ioral intervention, delivered by classroom teachers, and
aimed to reduce both anxiety and depressive symptoms
(Ahlen et al., 2012).
It is of worth to note another intervention program com-
bining educational and clinical approaches. This is the cogni-
tive-behavioral therapy (CBT)­based training. It is a program
based on coping and problem-solving strategies to reduce
cognitive maladaptive strategies in schoolchildren aged 9 to
10 years. This program is delivered in classroom by teachers
previously trained by school psychologists. The effective
findings highlight the importance to associate appropriate
educational and clinical interventions.
More specifically, Shaw (2008) postulated the necessity
to improve the education of students with BIF. The author
planned an educational program aimed at developing the
instructional practices to improve resilience skills. In turn,
these skills allow pupils with BIF to cope with emotional and
behavioral dysregulation as well as problematic social
functioning.
Second, parental intervention programs are needed. Poor
parenting profiles were often referred (Fenning, Baker,
Baker, & Crnic, 2007). Specifically, mothers of children with
BIF were found to be less positive and sensitive than mothers
of typically developing children as well as lacking of explan-
atory models for their children's difficulties.
However, the education of gifted children necessitates
special programs and adapted school curricula able to ade-
quately stimulate the cognitive abilities of these pupils. The
Personalized Model of Education for Gifted Children is an
appreciated educational program, which takes into consider-
ation the psychological and behavioral characteristics of
gifted children (Kelemen, 2010). It is a program to control
and reduce emotional and environmental risk factors, which
may cause underachievement and social-emotional malad-
justments. The goal is to develop an autonomous personality
and improve the level of self-esteem resulting in the preven-
tion of maladaptive self-awareness, perfectionism, and social
isolation (Majid & Alias, 2010).
