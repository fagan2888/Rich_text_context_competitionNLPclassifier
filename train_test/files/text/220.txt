Objective. This study examined whether economic and care obligations for family and kin salience influence retire-
ment decisions and whether such influences differ by race, gender, and marital status.
Data. Data from the first 2 waves of the National Survey of Families and Households were used. The sample con-
sisted of individuals who were employed at baseline and aged 55­75 at follow-up (N  897). Cox proportional hazard
regressions were used.
Results. Economic kin obligations impeded the likelihood of retiring. Individuals who made financial contributions
to children outside the household and White women with resident children in the household were less prone to retire.
Among Blacks, household composition effects were more complex and seemed to depend on the mix of care obliga-
tions, financial obligations, and financial contributions by resident kin. Kin salience also impinged on retirement deci-
sions. Some groups who lacked family ties (e.g., nonmarried childless men) were less inclined to retire, whereas other
subgroups (e.g., nonmarried men with monthly pre-retirement contacts with children) were more likely to retire.
Conclusions. Our data suggest the importance of family obligations and relationships in retirement decisions and
demonstrate considerable diversity in these processes. Models of retirement should pay greater attention to the interde-
pendence of work and family spheres and to the diversity of retirement processes among various population groups.
REDICTORS of retirement behavior or labor force
withdrawal in the later years are typically derived from
rational choice models that focus on individuals' own char-
acteristics (Szinovacz & Ekerdt, 1995) and often rely exclu-
sively on male samples (Hayward, Friedman, & Chen,
1996, 1998). Using concepts from the life course perspec-
tive (Bengtson & Allen, 1993; Elder, 1995; Moen, 1996;
O'Rand, 1996), we tested a model of retirement decisions
that pays tribute to marital and familial contingencies of re-
tirement processes and cultural embeddedness. Our objec-
tive was to assess whether selected family obligations and
relationships influence retirement decisions and whether
these influences differ by gender, race, and marital status.
We used data from the National Survey of Families and
Households (NSFH) for the analyses.
Theoretical Background
The life course perspective emphasizes interdependence
of life spheres and contextual embeddedness of life transi-
tions (Bengtson & Allen, 1993; Elder, 1995; Moen, 1996).
Interdependence of life spheres means that work and family
spheres are linked throughout individuals' lives and that life
experiences in one domain are connected with experiences
in the other domain. This interdependence implies that re-
tirement decisions derive not only from individual circum-
stances but also from the family situation. Contextual em-
beddedness draws attention to individuals' placement in the
social structure. Both work and family experiences differ
among societal subgroups, and these divergent experiences
are likely to inform retirement decisions. In line with these
assumptions, we based our theoretical model on the premise
that economic and care obligations for family, as well as sa-
lience of kin ties, influence retirement decisions. Further-
more, we expected that the impact of these family obliga-
tions and ties would vary by gender, race, and marital status.
Interlinked life spheres.--Family considerations that
may enter retirement decision processes include economic
family demands, care responsibilities that compete with
work obligations, and the salience of the family sphere. Past
research has suggested that retirement decisions are driven
by economic considerations such as benefit eligibility, fi-
nancial assets, and the expected economic utility of remain-
ing in or leaving the labor force (Burr, Massagli, Mutchler,
& Pienta, 1996; Fronstin, 1999; Honig, 1996, 1998; Pienta,
1999; Pienta, Burr, & Mutchler, 1994; Wray, 1996). Finan-
cial obligations for family members can also impinge on re-
tirement decisions. Individuals with financial obligations
for dependents tend to remain in the labor force and adopt
less positive attitudes toward retirement (Clark, Johnson, &
McDermed, 1980; Hayward et al., 1998; Henkens, 1999;
Henkens & Tazelaar, 1997; Turner, Bailey, & Scott, 1994).
Financial support to family members outside the household
may further curtail the feasibility of retiring. Because indi-
P
FAMILY OBLIGATIONS AND RETIREMENT S21
viduals' main financial responsibilities in later life are to-
ward their children, we focused on such obligations. Specif-
ically, we expected a lower probability of retirement among
individuals who either have children in the household or fi-
nancially support children outside the household.
Women, especially, often find it difficult to simulta-
neously attend to family and work obligations (Ferree,
1990; Lopata, 1995). Whereas care obligations for children
compete with work demands during parents' early life and
midlife, care obligations for other family members (e.g., ill
parents or spouses) may take precedence in the later years.
Earlier research showed effects of care for ill spouses on la-
bor force withdrawal, but the direction of this effect remains
unclear (Hayward et al., 1998; Honig, 1996; Szinovacz &
DeViney, 2000; Talaga & Beehr, 1995). Similarly, care ob-
ligations for kin may impinge on retirement decisions. Pre-
vious research linking care obligations for ill relatives to
employment decisions yielded contradictory evidence
(Hatch & Thompson, 1992; Pavalko & Artis, 1997; Ruhm,
1996; White-Means & Chollet, 1996). Most of these studies
included caregivers at different life stages. For persons who
are close to or have reached retirement age, withdrawal
from the labor force for caregiving purposes may be more
feasible than for younger caregivers. However, care for ill
relatives sometimes involves financial costs that may render
retirement more difficult (Ruhm, 1996). Thus, the overall
impact of caregiving on retirement decisions most likely de-
pends on the balance between required care effort and the
financial costs of the care arrangement.
Past research has demonstrated the viability of disposi-
tion factors for retirement decisions. Individuals' propensity
to retire has been linked to work commitment, workplace at-
tributes, and perceived benefits and costs of retirement for
personal or marital pursuits (George, Fillenbaum, & Pal-
more, 1984; Henkens, 1999; Henkens & Tazelaar, 1997;
Honig, 1998; Ruhm, 1996; Szinovacz & DeViney, 2000;
Taylor & Shore, 1995). Family ties may influence disposi-
tion toward retirement as well. Employment curtails how
much time individuals can devote to family activities, but it
also offers chances for social contacts and self-fulfillment
outside the family context. We expected that salient kin ties
would motivate individuals to retire, especially if their work
obligations precluded frequent kin interactions. On the other
hand, individuals lacking salient family ties may be less in-
clined to retire anticipating that withdrawal from the labor
force will curtail opportunities for social and personal ful-
fillment.
Contextual embeddedness.--Family ties and obliga-
tions differ among diverse subpopulation groups. Most im-
portant among these are variations by gender, race, and
marital status.
Although men continue to be viewed as main economic
providers, women carry major responsibility for noneco-
nomic family responsibilities and the management of kin re-
lationships (Ferree, 1990; Rossi & Rossi, 1990; Silverstein,
Lawton, & Bengtson, 1994). This gender difference is likely
to influence how kin obligations and relationships affect
men's and women's retirement decisions. We expected that
men's retirement decisions would reflect financial kin obli-
gations (see also Pienta, 1999; Pienta et al., 1994; Talaga &
Beehr, 1995), whereas care obligations and salience of kin
ties would be more influential for women's retirement deci-
sions.
In view of data limitations (the small number of ethnic
minorities other than African Americans), we were able to
assess differences between Whites and Blacks only. Many
studies have indicated that the kin networks of African
Americans are particularly close and characterized by mu-
tual economic and support exchanges, within and often
across households (Chatters & Jayakody, 1995; Scott &
Black, 1994). Furthermore, African American kinship net-
works seem to be matrifocal, that is, organized through fe-
male kinship ties (Scott & Black, 1994). We therefore ex-
pected a stronger influence of family obligations and
relationships for Blacks than for Whites and that this rela-
tionship would prevail among women.
Because kin relationships are typically managed by
women, men's access to kin is often mediated through their
wives' efforts (Antonucci, 1990; DiLeonardo, 1987), and
unmarried men sometimes lack close kin ties (Cooney &
Uhlenberg, 1990; Szinovacz, 1992). Although unmarried
women rarely lose contact with kin, they may develop a
strong commitment to their work and the social contacts
such employment affords, and they often lack financial re-
sources (O'Rand, 1996). Consequently, we expected kin ob-
ligations and relationships to have a stronger impact on
married than on nonmarried individuals' retirement.
METHODS
Sample
We used data from the National Survey of Families and
Households (NSFH), conducted in 1987­88 and 1992­94.
The NSFH is a multistage area probability sample consist-
ing of 13,008 respondents at Time 1 (for a detailed descrip-
tion of the study, see Sweet, Bumpass, & Call, 1988).
Weights adjust for nonresponses to the survey at Time 1 and
attrition between waves.
Because labor force withdrawal and self-definitions of re-
tirement can diverge (Ekerdt & DeViney, 1990; Flippen &
Tienda, 2000; Gibson, 1991; Hayward, Hardy, & Liu, 1994;
Mutchler, Burr, Pienta, & Massagli, 1997; Szinovacz &
DeViney, 1999), we relied on a subsample that consisted of
respondents at "risk" of retirement and excluded individuals
who were looking for a job and those whose retirement was
ambiguous (i.e., who left the labor force but self-defined as
not retired or who were employed and self-defined as re-
tiree). We considered individuals at risk of retirement if
they were employed 20 h/week or more at Time 1 and aged
55­75 at Time 2. We chose 20 work hours at Time 1 to
eliminate individuals engaged in sporadic employment ac-
tivities. These criteria led to exclusion of 13% of cases. Sen-
sitivity analyses (comparison of results based on different
sample specifications) indicated that effects of the family
variables considered in our analyses were unaffected by
sample selection. Because of these exclusions, our findings
pertain to retirement and may not be applicable to displaced
workers or to persons with sporadic employment.
Missing cases may lead to biased results, especially when
S22 SZINOVACZ ET AL.
cases are not missing completely at random, as was the case
for our data (Little's MCAR test p  .001; Little & Rubin,
1987). To avoid such bias, we created nine complete-case
data sets using the imputation regression method provided
by SPSS (SPSS, 1997). The results were based on multiple
imputation inference using NORM (Schafer, 1997). Com-
parison of results derived from the imputation regressions
with those we obtained using expectation-maximization im-
putation suggested that imputation method did not alter
findings.
Dependent Variable
The dependent variable was time to exit from the labor
force, measured in months, from Wave 1 to the date the re-
spondent stopped working. If he or she did not retire, time
was measured from the Wave 1 to the Wave 2 interview. A
dummy variable for stopped working was used as right-
hand censuring variable. In our weighted sample, 35% of
respondents retired between waves.
Family Obligations and Relationships
Presence of children in the household served as an indica-
tor of financial obligations. It was derived from household
rosters and was captured by two dummy variables--those
with one child and those with more than one child in the
household. Those without children in the household served
as reference. We also constructed other measures of chil-
dren's presence in the household (by children's gender and
age). Results pertaining to these measures are not shown in
the tables but are addressed in the text.
At baseline respondents were asked whether they or their
spouse regularly provided financial assistance to children
aged 19 or more. Respondents indicated each child to whom
such assistance was given. Because very few respondents fi-
nancially supported more than one or two children, we cre-
ated a dichotomous measure (1  "financial assistance
given," 0  "no financial assistance given").
Care obligations were based on questions about whether
and for whom respondents provided care inside the house-
hold and on questions pertaining to spouse's health. We
constructed two dichotomous measures, differentiating be-
tween care for spouses and care for other family members.
Spousal care was coded 1 for respondents who reported that
they cared for a disabled spouse in the household or whose
spouses indicated that they either had limitations in activi-
ties of daily living or that their health was poor or very poor.
Care for other family members was derived from questions
about respondents' care obligations. Those providing care
were coded 1. Note that care for spouses and other family
members could overlap although this was very rare.
We relied on three indicators to assess salience of kin
ties: whether respondents had children, whether their par-
ents were still alive, and the frequency of contacts with chil-
dren outside the household. Childlessness and both parents'
deaths (1  "yes," 0  "no") were both represented as di-
chotomous variables. The NSFH contains questions about
frequency of face-to-face contacts ("How often do you
see . . . ") with each adult child outside the household (1 
"not at all," 6  "several times a week"). We constructed
two dummy variables: respondents reporting at least weekly
visits with any child and those reporting fewer than weekly
but at least monthly visits (1  "has weekly visits," 1 
"has monthly visits"). Respondents who saw their children
less frequently (several times a year or less) served as refer-
ence category.
Controls
Numerous studies (for reviews, see Beehr, 1986; Feld-
man, 1994; Leonesio, 1996; Ruhm, 1996) have dem-
onstrated that retirement decisions are influenced by the
economic feasibility of retiring (i.e., whether continued em-
ployment is economically necessary or beneficial), barriers
to continued employment (illness, job displacement), and
disposition toward retirement (psychological and social
benefits and costs of leaving the labor force). The NSFH
contains some indicators for each of these domains but
lacks detailed information on pension eligibility and antici-
pated pension wealth. Because pension eligibility and
wealth tend to be closely associated with industry (core ver-
sus periphery), occupational characteristics, and work his-
tory (DeViney & Solomon, 1995; O'Rand, 1986; O'Rand &
Maclean, 1986), we initially performed models that in-
cluded indicators for core and periphery industry, major
Census occupation groups (managerial, technical, service,
farm, crafts, labor), earnings, work hours, years in the labor
force, and nonwage income and savings in addition to the
work and economic variables maintained in the models and
described later. These variables had no significant effect on
likelihood of retirement in our models, and their inclusion
or exclusion did not influence the effect of the family vari-
ables. We consequently dropped them from the final analy-
ses to enhance parsimony and reduce potential multicol-
linearity. It is, of course, conceivable that other variables
not contained in the NSFH (e.g., pension eligibility and
wealth) may alter the impact of the family variables consid-
ered here.
Individuals' economic ability to leave the labor force was
captured by indicators of benefit eligibility, socioeconomic
status, and variables related to employment history. The
NSFH does not contain direct measures of Social Security
eligibility. Instead, we employed age categories (60­61, 62­
64, 65 and over). Persons under age 60 were the reference.
Concerning pensions, NSFH respondents reported whether
they were enrolled in a pension plan and whether they ex-
pected to or were then receiving a pension. The wording of
the last two items is such that it was impossible to distin-
guish individuals who had reached pension eligibility but
deferred their claims from those who had not reached eligi-
bility. However, we could distinguish persons who were en-
rolled in pension plans from those who were not (1  "no
pension").
In addition to benefit eligibility, we included indicators of
work context and employment history. Occupational pres-
tige influences work commitment (Hayward et al., 1998)
and also helps define pension eligibility (DeViney, 1995;
O'Rand, 1996). Occupational prestige was obtained from
descriptions of respondents' current or most recent job and
was based on Stevens and Cho's (1985) recoding of the
1980 Census occupational classification scheme. In view of
the restricted pension measure and reference to current
FAMILY OBLIGATIONS AND RETIREMENT S23
rather than main career job, we further included several
work context variables that may help distinguish individuals
in bridge jobs from those who were still in their main career
job at Time 1. These variables were work disruptions between
waves (but prior to retirement if it occurred) and self-employ-
ment. The measure of work disruptions relied on detailed
work histories and was coded as a dichotomous variable (1 
"did disrupt employment"). Self-employment was based on
whether respondents derived income from self-employment
(1  "yes"). Because spouse's earnings or pensions contrib-
ute to an individual's economic situation and have previ-
ously been linked to retirement decisions (Anderson, Clark,
& Johnson, 1980; Burkhauser, Couch, & Phillips, 1996;
Clark et al., 1980; Fronstin, 1999), we further added indica-
tors for spouses' employment (1  "employed at Time 1")
and enrollment in a pension plan (1  "yes") to our models.
Health in general and disability in particular exert a
strong influence on people's decisions to remain in the labor
force (Bound, Schoenbaum, & Waidmann, 1995; Burr et al.,
1996; Hayward et al., 1998; Pienta et al., 1994; Pienta,
1999; Santiago & Muschkin, 1996; Wray, 1996). Self-
reported health was measured with the question: "Com-
pared to other people your age, how would you describe
your health?" (1  "very poor," 5  "excellent"). Disability
was measured by reporting of health problems that limit
employment (1  "yes"). Some individuals may have en-
countered health problems between waves. We could not date
such changes, and their inclusion as a predictor of retirement
would hence be problematic. However, we tested whether
inclusion of change in health between waves affected the in-
fluence of the family variables and found no effect.
Past research has further suggested that individuals' work
commitment may motivate them to remain in the labor force
(George et al., 1984; Hayward & Grady, 1990; Hayward et
al., 1998; Taylor & Shore, 1995). This possibility was mea-
sured with an indicator of job dissatisfaction. Respondents
were asked if they agreed or disagreed with the following
statement: "The job I do is one of the most satisfying parts
of my life" (1  "strongly agree," 5  "strongly disagree").
Background
Background characteristics were marital status (1  "not
married"), race (two dummy variables, one for Blacks and
one for all other minorities; White was the reference cate-
gory), and gender (1  "female"). Some individuals' mari-
tal status changed between waves. However, inclusion of
such changes had no effect on the influence of the family
variables. We assessed all independent variables except age
at baseline to ensure accurate causal attributions. Means and
standard deviations of the independent variables are shown
in Table 1.
Data Analyses
Cox proportional hazard regressions were used for the
analyses (Allison, 1984; Yamaguchi, 1991). Cox propor-
tional hazard models (often called event history analysis)
are a statistical method for the analysis of duration or sur-
vival data. Cox models allow for censored data--that is, not
all events (e.g., retirement) need to occur for all persons--
and account both for the occurrence of an event (retirement)
and when it occurred (time of retirement for those who re-
tired). In Table 2 we present hazard ratios (the exponenti-
ated regression coefficient). A ratio greater than 1 means
that a predictor increases the chance of retirement, and a ra-
tio less than 1 denotes a decreased chance of retirement.
The analyses proceeded in three steps. We first estimated
a model that included all variables other than family obliga-
tions and relationships (Model 1 in Table 2). The second
model added family obligations and relationships (Model
2). We then tested (Models 3­5) systematically for interac-
tions (Aiken & West, 1991) between the family variables
and gender, race, and marital status, starting with three-way
interactions (either Gender  Race  Family Variable or
Gender  Marital Status  Family Variable). We had too
few cases to test for Race  Marital Status interactions or
for higher order interaction terms. We tested interaction
terms with each family variable in separate models to limit
multicollinearity. If the three-way interaction was not sig-
nificant, we then tested (again in separate models) for lower
order interactions (e.g., Gender  Family Variable, Race 
Family Variable). Because higher interaction terms are of-
ten difficult to interpret from mere examination of the re-
gression coefficients, we further calculated linear predic-
tions from the estimated models for the pertinent subgroups.

These data are not shown but we used them to explain the
reported interaction effects.
All of the analyses were performed with sampling
weights. The NSFH Wave 2 weights accounted for over-
samples, nonresponses at baseline, and attrition. Use of
weights, in combination with robust estimates of variance
specifically designed for complex samples, allows adjust-
ment for dependency within the primary sampling units in
the NSFH and for stratification (Stata, 1999). Variance in-
flation tests (Fox, 1991) suggested that multicollinearity
was not a problem in our analyses.
RESULTS
Results from the proportional hazard regressions are pre-
sented in Table 2. The first model presented in the table in-
cludes exclusively individual characteristics, Model 2 adds
family variables, and Models 3­5 add significant interaction
terms. Because our main interest was in family variables,
the discussion focuses on results pertaining to these vari-
ables. The inclusion of family obligations and relationships
contributed significantly to model fit as indicated by com-
parisons of fit statistics for the individual and family model

FAMILY OBLIGATIONS AND RETIREMENT S25
.001 for all respondents). This finding supported our main
assumption that family experiences contribute to retirement
decisions. The only significant main effect, however, was
that persons providing financial help to children outside the
household were less prone to retire (Table 2, Model 2). This
trend seemed to hold across subpopulations (i.e., there were
no significant interactions).
Although only one main effect emerged, several interac-
tion effects were detected. The effect of children in the
household differed by race and gender (see Table 2, Model
3). Black women with one child in the household were more
likely to retire, whereas White women and Black men with
one child in the household were less inclined to retire. Addi-
tional analyses (not shown) further revealed that Blacks (re-
gardless of gender) with two or more children in the house-
hold demonstrated a particularly high propensity toward
retirement. Although the latter interaction by race was sig-
nificant (b  1.23, p  .01), inclusion of this interaction
term did not contribute to model fit.
Because care obligations for ill relatives (other than
spouses) inside the household were quite rare, we could
only test for simple interactions (by gender, race, marital
status). Nonetheless, the data (not shown) suggested that ef-
fects of care inside the household varied by race. Blacks
showed a decreased tendency to retire when they had care
obligations for relatives inside the household (interaction b 
1.56, p  .05). However, inclusion of this interaction term
did not contribute to model fit.
An interaction effect involving childlessness, gender, and
marital status was also identified (Table 2, Model 4).
Women with children were more prone to retire, whereas
childless married women and childless nonmarried men
were less inclined to retire. Similarly, there were interaction
effects comprising contacts with children, gender, and mari-
tal status (Table 2, Model 5). Men who did not have weekly
contacts with their children were more and women lacking
weekly contacts with children were less likely to retire. Fur-
thermore, nonmarried men with monthly contacts were par-
ticularly prone to retire, whereas women (regardless of mar-
ital status) and nonmarried men who did not see their
children on a monthly basis were less inclined to retire.
DISCUSSION
Our main objective in this study was to investigate
whether family obligations and relationships relate to retire-
ment decisions and whether such relationships differ by
gender, race, or marital status. Our results suggest the im-
portance of family obligations and ties for retirement deci-
sions, as indicated by the substantial enhancement in model
fit when family variables are added to individual predictors
of retirement. Specifically, individuals with financial re-
sponsibility for children are less likely to retire. This could
suggest that continued financial liabilities, even for adult
children who have left the household, may render retirement
economically more difficult. It is also possible, however,
that respondents who do not plan to retire within the fore-
seeable future are more willing than those with more imme-
diate retirement plans to provide financial supports to chil-
dren. This finding is compatible with a life course
perspective, which emphasizes the interconnection of work
and family spheres (Moen, 1996; Szinovacz & Ekerdt,
1995) and suggests that individual-oriented models of re-
tirement processes are incomplete.
There also is evidence for gender, race, and marital status
variations in the influence of selected family variables, con-
firming the diversity of retirement processes across popula-
tion groups (Calasanti, 1993, 1996; Szinovacz, 1991). Spe-
cifically, Black women with one child in the household tend
toward retirement, whereas White women and Black men
with one child in the household are less prone to retire. Ad-
ditional findings (not shown) further reveal that household
composition effects may differ by co-resident children's
gender and age. Because gender, age, and number of chil-
dren in the household correlate, we cannot determine which
of these factors is most relevant. The complexity of the
household composition effects suggests that children's pres-
ence in the household reflects a variety of conditions with
diverse consequences for retirement decisions. It can imply
an economic liability but may also denote care obligations
(for younger or disabled children and, perhaps, co-resident
grandchildren) or even economic help from children to par-
ents. Clearly, more research is needed to unravel the mean-
ing of household composition for retirement decisions.
There is little support for our assumption that care for ill
spouses or other disabled family members relates to retire-
ment decisions. This finding needs to be viewed with some
caution. Other analyses based exclusively on NSFH couples
have suggested that men with care responsibilities for their
wives are more prone to retire (Szinovacz & DeViney,
2000). As far as care for other family members is con-
cerned, our analyses are seriously restricted by the small
number of caregivers in the sample and the lack of informa-
tion on extent of care responsibility. These limitations may
also account for contradictory findings concerning the im-
pact of caregiving on employment in previous studies
(Hatch & Thompson, 1992; Pavalko & Artis, 1997; Ruhm,
1996; White-Means & Chollet, 1996). Furthermore, some
care may involve financial costs, thus hindering rather than
promoting withdrawal from the labor force, and these ef-
fects may cancel each other out.
Salience of family ties seems to play some role in retire-
ment decisions. Effects are most pronounced for ties to chil-
dren, most likely due to individuals' greater stake in rela-
tionships with their offspring than with other kin (Giarrusso,
Stallings, & Bengtson, 1995). Once again, these influences
seem to be subgroup-specific. Effects of childlessness differ
by gender and marital status. That nonmarried childless men
are particularly unlikely to retire is in line with our expecta-
tion that lack of salient family ties may induce individuals
to remain in the labor force. Of course, childlessness could
itself derive from very high work demands or, alternatively,
long-term exposure to marginal economic positions that re-
duce retirement benefits and hence options for voluntary
earlier retirement (Hayward et al., 1998). Childless married
women may be particularly career oriented and conse-
quently inclined to postpone their retirement. Thus, lack of
salient family ties could influence retirement decisions ei-
ther through its direct impact on disposition toward retire-
ment or through its association with and reflection of career
opportunities and decisions over the life course.

There also is some support for our contention that fre-
quency of contacts with children relates to retirement deci-
sions. The reduced likelihood of retirement among nonmar-
ried men who have no monthly contacts with children may
again be indicative of this group's special situation both in
regard to kin salience and work history. Similarly, women
who lack weekly or monthly contacts with children are less
inclined to leave the labor force. These women may be
faced with undue barriers (e.g., geographical distance, es-
trangement) to enhance contacts after retiring and thus be
less disposed toward retirement. On the other hand, some
men (those who do not have weekly contacts with children
and unmarried men with monthly contacts) may see in re-
tirement an opportunity to catch up with their children.
Taken together, our analyses suggest that kin relations
play a role in retirement decisions. However, data limita-
tions and the complexity of findings (especially subgroup
differences) preclude unambiguous causal interpretations.
Specifically, the relatively small sample size for the present
analyses and consequently small cell frequencies for se-
lected subgroups render testing of interactions difficult.
Multiple hypothesis testing involving the search for signifi-
cant interactions can result in Type I error. Although we re-
stricted our interpretation to interactions that significantly
contributed to model fit, the potential for such error cannot
be fully discarded. In addition, the NSFH lacks information
on several established predictors of retirement, especially
pension eligibility and wealth. Although we find that inclu-
sion of pension-related variables in the models does not al-
ter results pertaining to the family variables, better indica-
tors for the potential economic consequences of retirement
may be related to and modify effects of family variables on
retirement decisions. The intersection of work and family
spheres over the life span also may evolve into distinct pre-
retirement conditions that can either deter or promote labor
force withdrawal. Future research should address these lim-
itations. Furthermore, detailed measures of family eco-
nomic liabilities, care responsibilities, and fulfillment of
contact needs with close relatives are necessary for re-
searchers to adequately assess family influences on retire-
ment processes. It may also be useful for researchers to in-
vestigate economic transfers from relatives as possible
anticipated sources of retirement income. Especially under-
privileged populations still rely to some extent on family
strategies to secure old age economic well-being, as was the
case prior to the establishment of Social Security (Haber &
Gratton, 1994).
Despite these caveats, our findings have implications for
retirement research and policy. They provide evidence that
inclusion of both marital and family characteristics in retire-
ment models can help enhance model specification. It is im-
portant to note, however, that addition of family variables
has no impact on the effects of other variables typically con-
sidered in retirement models. Thus, models excluding mari-
tal and family variables are not misspecified but incom-
plete; that is, additional refinement of retirement models can
be achieved through inclusion of marital and family charac-
teristics. Similarly, our findings underline the need for
greater acknowledgment of diversity in retirement pro-
cesses among diverse subpopulations. They indicate that
this diversity cannot be fully captured by reference to health
and economic limitations among minorities but requires
more complex understanding of life course processes and
family transactions. Recognition of these complex pro-
cesses will not only enhance theory development but is also
necessary for policy. Retirement policies rely on the pre-
dictability of individuals' retirement behaviors. Refined
model specification can enhance such predictability and
thus the efficiency of measures to secure old age provisions
into the future. Because Social Security constitutes the main
basis of retirement income for economically underprivi-
leged groups (O'Rand, 1996; Pampel, 1998), the conse-
quences of inadequate old age provisions will fall most
heavily on these groups.
