Abstract
Background: Patients' views are being given more and more importance in policy-making.
Understanding populations' perceptions of quality of care is critical to developing measures to
increase the utilization of primary health care services. Using the data from the South African World
Health Survey (WHS), the current study aims to evaluate the degree of health care service
responsiveness (both out-patient and in-patient) and comparing experiences of individuals who
used public and private services in South Africa.
Methods: A population-based survey of 2352 participants (1116 men and 1236 women) was
conducted in South Africa in 2003, the WHS ­ as part of a World Health Organization (WHO)
project focused on health system performance assessment in member countries.
Results: Health care utilization was among those who attended in-patient care 72.2% attended a
public and 24.3% a private facility, and of those who attended out-patient care 58.7% attended a
public and 35.7% a private facility. Major components identified for out-patient care responsiveness
in this survey were highly correlated with health care access, communication and autonomy,
secondarily to dignity, confidentiality and quality of basic amenities, and thirdly to health problem
solution. The degree of responsiveness with publicly provided care was in this study significantly
lower than in private health care. Overall patient non-responsiveness for the public out-patient
service was 16.8% and 3.2% for private care. Discrimination was also one of the principal reasons
for non-responsiveness in all aspects of provided health care.
Conclusion: Health care access, communication, autonomy, and discriminatory experiences were
identified as priority areas for actions to improve responsiveness of health care services in South
Africa.
Background
The majority of South Africans depend on the public
health sector for their health care needs [1]; the percentage
of adults who reported that they have medical aid in the
Demographic and Health Survey in 2003 was 14.2% [2].
Shisana et al. [3] found in a nationally representative sur-
vey that the majority (70%) indicated that they usually
attended public health care services, while 23.3%
attended private health care services, and a small propor-
tion (0.1%) utilised traditional health practitioners. In
many areas of South Africa, the Primary Health Care
(PHC) facilities are the only available or easily accessible
health service for local communities. As a result, PHC
services, providers and facilities carry a large burden and

responsibility for the provision of health care in South
Africa. PHC is the basic mechanism for providing health
care [4]. It was formally introduced in South Africa in
April 1994 as the major principle for health care provision
with the implementation of two policies, "Free health care
for pregnant mothers and children under the age of six
years" as well the "Universal Access to PHC for All South
Africans" [4]. The Department of Health's strategic frame-
work for 2002­2004 identifies improvements of quality
of care as one of the four key challenges currently facing
the health sector in South Africa [5]. Quality of care is con-
cerned with the interface between provider and patients,
between health services and community. A quality per-
spective changes the focus of health systems development
from establishing structures to addressing what happens
in the structures. Improving quality can, therefore, be
regarded as a second phase of health care transformation
in South Africa. The first phase was concerned with creat-
ing coherent health care structures and the second phase
with ensuring quality of service delivery [5].
Variations in the perception of quality occur as a result of
the heterogeneous nature of the definition of quality.
Studies have pointed to variations in perception of quality
by different socioeconomic groups as well as the environ-
mental aspects such as the social, organisational and tech-
nological context of the service [6]. Van Vuuren and Botes
[7] found among a culturally diverse population in an
urban area in South Africa (greater Bloemfontein) that
variables such as population group, age and employment
status influence their attitudes towards professional
health care. They further emphasise the importance of
bringing these issues to the attention of health care policy
makers. Peltzer [8] found in a community survey in rural
South Africa a low acceptability of primary health care:
78% felt that the medical services are poor. Bediako, Nel
and Hiemstra [9] found among hospital and out-patients
in the North-West Province that more than half of the
patients (56.8%) were not satisfied with the availability of
medicines and other supplies. Approximately two thirds
of patients (65.2%) did not know about the quality of tel-
ephone services rendered. There was a high level of dissat-
isfaction (63.1%) among patients regarding accessing
doctors after hours. Most patients were satisfied with the
general attitude of health workers (62.1%) but 21.2%
were dissatisfied. De Jager and Du Plooy [10] found
among in- and out-patients in a provincial hospital in
Gauteng significant differences between in- and out-
patients. Personal safety and cleanliness of facilities were
regarded as the most important variables in the assurance
and tangibility dimensions. The level of satisfaction was
the highest for clear information and communication at
an understandable level in the tangibility and assurance
categories, respectively. The South African Department of
Health [2] found that there was an increase in the percent-
age of adults who expressed dissatisfaction with all types
of health services, except for traditional healers, compar-
ing the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of 1998
and 2003. Generally, the results show that considerably
more people are dissatisfied with the services rendered in
hospitals, both public (23.3%) and private (11.6%). Even
the levels of dissatisfaction with the services rendered by
solo practitioners in the private sector (7.9%) seem to be
on the increase during the period between the surveys.
The major reasons for dissatisfaction with the public sec-
tor hospitals and community health centres were long
waiting times (41.5% and 38.1% respectively), staff atti-
tudes (22.8% and 25.9% respectively), non-availability of
prescribed medication (15.8% and 17.7% respectively)
and shortages of staff (doctors/pharmacists). Major rea-
sons for dissatisfaction in the private hospital/clinic sector
and private doctor were also long waiting times (26.7%
and 7.4% respectively), staff attitude (18.0% and 7.1%
respectively), and cost (15.2% and 24.8% respectively)
[2]. Myburgh, Solanki, Smith and Lalloo [11] used a 1998
national population-based survey and found that both
race and socio-economic status (SES) were significant pre-
dictors of levels of satisfaction with the services of the
health care provider; White and high SES respondents
were about 1.5 times more likely to report excellent serv-
ice compared with African Black and low SES respond-
ents, respectively.
Patients' views are being given more and more impor-
tance in policy-making. Understanding populations' per-
ceptions of quality of care is critical to developing
measures to increase the utilization of primary health care
services.
A population-based survey was conducted in South Africa
in 2003, the WHS ­ as part of a WHO project focused on
health system performance assessment in member coun-
tries. Among the surveyed aspects was the evaluation of
health care provision, based on the concept of "respon-
siveness" [12]. Using the data from the South African
WHS, the current study aims to evaluate the degree of
responsiveness with provided health care (both out-
patient and in-patient), and comparing the experiences of
individuals who used public and private services in South
Africa.
Methods
Sample and procedure
The country sample (n = 2352) was nationally represent-
ative and probabilistically selected using a multistage clus-
ter design. All respondents were selected using a Kish table
for selection within a household. The study included: (1)
all individuals who had been hospitalized in the previous
five years (stayed overnight in a hospital or other type of
long-term care facility), and (2) among those who had not

been hospitalized in the previous five years, all individu-
als who had used an out-patient health service in the past
12 months. Only the participants who had used an in-
patient and/or out-patient health services were requested
to complete the responsiveness questions. The number of
responses obtained was a function of the overall response
rate as well as the rate of service utilization in the previous
12 months for out-patient and 5 years for in-patient serv-
ices. More detailed information about the World Health
Survey is available on its website http://www.who.int/
healthinfo/survey/en/index.html. To adjust for the popu-
lation distribution as represented by the UN Statistical
Division and for non-response, post-stratification correc-
tions were made to the sampling weights.
Participants were interviewed face-to-face by lay people
with at least a high school-level education; interviewers
were trained in a week-long course using a standard man-
ual and audiovisual aids as well as role-plays. Practice
field interviews were reviewed by supervisors before actual
data collection. All questionnaires were translated into
major languages in South Africa and back-translated using
a standard WHO protocol. The quality of translations was
independently verified by bilingual experts before field
implementation. Informed consent was obtained from all
respondents and the study was cleared by ethics review
committees.
Outcome measures
The questionnaire included in this analysis used the
health system responsiveness module. Responsiveness
relates to patient's experiences with the health system,
with a focus on the interpersonal aspects of the care, and
differs from patient satisfaction, a construct that reflects
people's expectations in addition to their experiences
[13].
Questions covered the following aspects: traveling time to
the health care provider (item wording: For your last visit
[or hospital stay], how would you rate the traveling time
to the health care provider [or hospital]?); waiting time
before being attended to; being greeted and talked to
respectfully; respect for intimacy during physical exami-
nation and care; clarity of explanations by the health care
providers; availability of time to ask questions about the
health problem or treatment; possibility of obtaining
information on other types of treatment or tests; partici-
pation in decision-making on the health care or treat-
ment; patient's freedom to speak privately with the health
professionals; personal information kept confidential;
freedom to choose the health care provider; inside the
facility cleanliness including toilets; and available space in
waiting and examination rooms. For participants who
received in-patient care, two additional aspects were
included: ease in receiving visits by family members (item
wording: For your last hospital stay, how would you rate
the ease of having family and friends visit you? and con-
tact with the outside world) [13]. Response options for
these responsiveness items were 1 = very good, 2 = good,
3 = moderate, 4 = bad, and 5 = very bad. These item
responses were dichotomised into "1" and "2" = 1, and 3­
5 = 0. In addition, there were three items for both out-
patients and in-patients related to the health profes-
sional's skills (item wording for out-patients: In your
opinion was the health care provider's skill adequate for
your treatment? and item wording for in-patients: In your
opinion, was the skill of the health care providers ade-
quate for your treatment?), availability of medicines, and
adequacy of equipment in the care; response options for
these items were "yes" or "no". Cronbach alpha for the 16
items out-patients responsiveness scale was .89 for this
sample and for the 18 items in-patient responsiveness
scale .90 for this sample. Further, participants were asked

whether they felt they had been treated worse by the
health care providers (whether they felt discriminated) for
on any of the following reasons: sex, age, lack of money,
social class, ethnic group or skin color, type of illness, or
nationality. Response options for these 7 items were "yes"
or "no" [13].
Data analysis
The first stage of this work included a descriptive analysis
of the degree of responsiveness based on a set of variables
that expressed the user's degree of experience, according to
five response levels (1 = very good to 5 = very bad). For
each of the items, the degree of responsiveness was esti-
mated by the percentage of "good" or "very good" answers
and the percentage of positive answers to three other
dichotomous variables (yes or no), related to the health
professional's skills, availability of medicines, and ade-
quacy of equipment in the care. Percentages of patients'
experiences were analyzed by "type of care" (out-patient
or in-patient) and by public and private health care service
utilization [13].
To explain total variation in the data set using a smaller
number of factors, the second stage of the analysis used
principal component analysis with varimax rotation.
Logistic regression was conducted for public versus private
health care provider, and linear regression for the total
responsiveness scale (16 responsiveness items for out-
patients and 18 responsiveness items for in-patients), sep-
arately for public and private health care utilization.
Demographic variables included sex, two age groups (18
to 39 and 40 years and above), two educational groups
(up to primary school completed and above) [13], dis-
criminatory experiences were summed up and converted
into a binary variable with 1 = indicating any of the six dis-
criminatory experiences and 0 = no such experiences.
For the statistical analysis the data were weighted accord-
ing to the sampling design using Stata software version
10.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA).
Results
The final sample included 2352 participants (1116 men
and 1236 women) with a mean age of 37.6 years (SD =
14.3), range 18 to 97 years; the household response rate
was 80% and the individual response rate was 90%. Aver-
age item missing rates were less than 1% (range 0­1.8%)
for the responsiveness questions. Of the 2352 interview-
ees, 656 (28.3%) reported in-patient care in the five years
prior to the survey. Of these, 72.2% attended a govern-
ment public facility, 24.3% a privately operated health

facility, 1.3% an NGO and 2.4% other. Among the partic-
ipants, 449 (19.4%) had received outpatient care at least
once in the year prior to the interview. Of these, 58.7%
attended a government public facility, 35.7% a privately
operated health facility, 0.9% an NGO and 4.7% other.
Overall, 5.1% reported to have health insurance. The type
of the last out-patient health care provider visited was
52.6% medical doctor, 36.9% nurse, 5.5% dentist, 2.5%
physiotherapist and 2.4% other, none indicated tradi-
tional health practitioner.
According to the evaluation of out-patient care (see Table
1), "waiting time for care" showed the lowest degree of
responsiveness (51.2%) among all the areas analyzed.
While, the aspects related to health professionals' skills
(92.3%), adequate equipment (91.6%), adequate availa-
bility of medicines received (87.1%), and respect for inti-
macy during physical examination (77.9%) had the
highest responsiveness scores. The percentage of users
who gave "good" or "very good" ratings was lower among
users of the public health care system for all aspects stud-
ied, both for out-patient and inpatient care. The percent-
age of users who rated their experiences with "bad" or
"very bad" was 16.8% for public and 3.2% for private out-
patient care (see Table 1).

Among all the aspects of in-patient care responsiveness
(Table 2), the lowest percentage of responsiveness was
attributed to "freedom to choose the health care provider"
(55.7%), while areas related to adequate health care pro-
vider skills, equipment, and availability of medicines had
the highest health system responsiveness.
A significant proportion of out-patient care users experi-
enced discrimination for the following reasons: 11.9%
reported feeling they had been treated worse than others
because of lack of money and 9.3% because of their social
class. Among users of the public services these figures were
15.9% and 13.3%, respectively. Of all users, 6.4%
reported they had been treated worse because of their skin
colour. Interviewees who had been hospitalized in the
previous five years reported lower discrimination rates
than out-patients, with "lack of money", race and "social
class" as major factors. Users of in-patient and out-patient
public health care reported significantly higher discrimi-
nation rates than private health care patients (see Table 3
and 4).
Principal component analysis found for out-patient care
responsiveness three main factors explaining 58.5% of the
variance and for in-patient care responsiveness four fac-
tors explaining 62.9% of the variance. The three factors for
out-patient care responsiveness included 1) six items with
two each on time, communication and autonomy
(explaining 38.6% of the variance), 2) six items with each
two items on dignity, confidentiality and quality of basic
amenities (explaining 12.5% of the variance), and 3)
three items on health problem solution (explaining 7.4%
of the variance). The four factors for the in-patient care
satisfaction included 1) six items with two each on com-
munication, autonomy and confidentiality (explaining
37.1% of the variance), 2) four items with two each on
time and dignity (explaining 11.7% of the variance), 3)
three items on health problem solution (explaining 8.0%
of the variance), and 4) four items with two each on qual-
ity of basic amenities and access to family and community
support (explaining 6.2% of the variance). The overall
responsiveness score was for out-patients 67% and for in-
patients 68% (see Table 5).
The results of the multivariate analysis of the joint influ-
ence of sex, age group, formal education, public versus
private health care, and discrimination experience on
health care responsiveness are presented in Table 6. Only
private health service and lower discrimination experi-
enced were consistently associated with the total patient
satisfaction score.
Discussion
The study conducted among a nationally representative
sample in South Africa found that of those who attended
in-patient care 72.2% attended a public and 24.3% a pri-
vate facility, and of those who attended out-patient care
58.7% attended a public and 35.7% a private facility,
none indicated traditional health practitioner. Similarly,
Shisana et al. [3] found in a nationally representative
study that the majority (70%) indicated that they usually
attended public health care services, 23.3% attended pri-
vate health care services, and 0.1% utilised traditional
health practitioners.
The international comparison of health care responsive-
ness using the same measures and analysis found that
overall South Africa (67% for out-patients and 68% for in-
patients) had much lower responsiveness than Brazil
(80% for out-patients and 76% for in-patients) and Israel
and 14 European countries (81% and higher) for both
out-patient and in-patient care. Looking at different com-

ponents of responsiveness, South Africa scored particu-
larly low on waiting time (58% for out-patients and 66%
for in-patients) and autonomy (60% for out-patients and
61% for in-patients) care compared to Brazil (65% and
69% for out-patient and in-patient experiences respec-
tively for waiting time and 70% and 66% respectively for
autonomy), Israel (69% and 77% for waiting time and
80% and 79% for autonomy) and European countries
(72% and 81% for waiting time and 83% and 72% for
autonomy. The relative rankings of the domains among
out-patients were similar in South Africa and Brazil, with
the three highest rankings on confidentiality, dignity and
communication, and the three lowest on waiting time,
autonomy and quality of basic amenities. Regarding rela-
tive rankings on the domains among out-patients rank-
ings were similar in South Africa and Brazil, with quality
of basic amenities ranking third, after dignity and confi-
dence. Rankings for European countries were similar, with
the exception that quality of basic amenities was ranked
higher than in middle income countries (Brazil and South
Africa) (see Table 7) [13-15].
Principal component analysis found in this study that
responsiveness in out-patients included as major factors
waiting time/communication/autonomy followed by dig-
nity/confidentiality/basic amenities, and for in-patients
communication/autonomy/confidentiality, waiting time/
dignity and lastly quality of basic amenities/support. Sim-
ilarly, Valentine, Darby and Bonsel [16] found from gen-
eral population surveys of "health systems
responsiveness" in 41 countries that most respondents
selected prompt attention as the most important domain.
Dignity was selected second, followed by communica-
tion. Access to social support networks was identified as
the least important domain. The factor solutions from this
study did not confirm the domain structure of 7 domains
of previous studies [17]. This study underlines different
clustering patterns of responsiveness for out-patients and
in-patients in South Africa, in the Brazilian WHYS study
[13] and in a study in Taiwan that found five factors
(respect, access, confidentiality, basic amenities, and
social support) [18]. For example, "autonomy" was in this
and the Taiwanese study [18] not conceptualized as a
unique domain. Further, studies are needed to identify the
structure of health systems responsiveness domains in
developing countries.
Regarding health care provider skills among out-patients
in this study similar results were found between this study
and the Brazilian WHS: 92.3% and 92.9% respectively,
adequate equipment 91.3% and 91.6% respectively, and
adequate availability of medicines 80.8% and 87.1%, and
also among inpatients 91.3% and 93.7% for satisfactory
health care provider skills, 92.3% and 91.8% for adequate
equipment, and 92.9 and 89.7 for availability of medicine
[13].

Major components identified for out-patient care respon-
siveness in this survey were highly correlated with health
care access, communication and autonomy, secondarily
to dignity, confidentiality and quality of basic amenities,
and thirdly to health problem solution. Thus, from the
perspective of health service users in South Africa, health
care responsiveness was primarily related to health care
access, communication and autonomy. Each of the three
components got the lowest responsiveness ratings (59%­
77%) compared to the other components (dignity, confi-
dentiality, basic amenities and health problem solution)
(76%­84%).
The degree of responsiveness with publicly provided care
was in this study significantly lower than in private health
care; a finding which was also found in local studies [2,8]
and in the Brazilian WHS [13]. Overall lack of responsive-
ness for the public out-patient service was 16.8% in this
study, which is lower to the DHS survey (23.3%) measur-
ing patient dissatisfaction [2]. Both studies were con-
ducted in the same year, 2003. Possible explanations for
the above differences may lie in the better quality of pri-
vate services or that expectations are already high among
the population, both for users and nonusers, and because
the different measures used in terms of getting a lower
score with the responsiveness measure as compared to a
dissatisfaction measure. In this study 15.4% of public out-
patients were dissatisfied with the availability of medi-
cines, which seem lower than in some local studies,
56.8% [9]. In multivariate regression analysis sex, age and
educational level were not found to be associated with
health care responsiveness unlike in some other studies
[7,11,13,17].
Another problem identified in this study and also con-
firmed in the Brazilian WHS [13] was the high percentage
of individuals who felt discrimination, regardless of pub-
lic or private health care. Discrimination was also one of
the principal reasons for dissatisfaction in all aspects of
provided health care. The principal sources of discrimina-
tion identified by respondents were lack of money, social
class and race. Gueveiva et al. [13] also found among the
Brazilian WHS lack of money and social class as major fac-
tors of health care discrimination. It is important to note
that the percentages of individuals who felt they had been
treated worse than others on grounds of social exclusion
were consistently higher among users of the public health
care system, a practice that runs counter to the Bhato Pele
(People first) guiding principles of the South African
health care system. According to a qualitative study by
Mashego and Peltzer [19] discrimination was also identi-
fied among primary public care users.
Unlike in some other studies [7], this study did not find
significant associations between socio-demographic vari-
ables (age, sex and formal education) and patient satisfac-
tion.
Conclusion
Health care access, communication, autonomy, and dis-
criminatory experiences were identified as priority areas
for actions to improve responsiveness and patient satisfac-

tion in South Africa. Implications for policymaking
include that the result from the survey can be used to pri-
oritize efforts when resources are limited. The data seem
to provide a clear message to prioritize reforms that
improve prompt attention, but not at the expense of
patient dignity and communication, which may damage
the acceptability of health services to users, and result in
barriers to access.
Study limitations
In this survey all respondents who had been hospitalized
in the five years prior to the survey were asked about their
most recent hospitalization, and all others were asked
about their most recent ambulatory visit in the previous
year. The result is that the set of respondents who
answered the questions about ambulatory care is small
and not representative of the general population, but
rather of the population that had not been hospitalized
during the previous five years. The cross-sectional study
design did not permit an investigation of the cause-effect
relationship between responsiveness and independent
variables. Recall bias of study participants cannot be
excluded, especially on the 5 year recall period for hospi-
tal admission.
