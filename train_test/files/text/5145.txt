Introduction
Since the war-on-terror, information gathering and the
monitoring of everyday life is pervasive and, in some
cases, expected by the general public. This expectation is
particularly prevalent during outbreaks of violent social
unrest or any other situation that simulates the often latent
culture of fear (Furedi, 2002; Green & Smith, 2004; Lyon,
2006; Mythen & Walklate, 2006; Rule, 2002). While there
is less familiarity with pain and suffering, debilitating dis-
ease and death, in developed countries, than ever before,
fear has become an omnipresent part of everyday life. A
central element of this culture is the inherent conviction
that humanity continually faces threats, which challenge
daily existence; consequently fear becomes an all-pervad-
ing force in the everyday life (Furedi, 2002). A culture of
fear is driven by "risk perceptions," as Furedi asserts "fears
about the future are linked to anxieties about problems
today' (2002, p. 18); thus, risk perceptions are expressed
through shared cultural beliefs and political judgments
about an uncertain future (Wilkinson, 2001a, 2001b, and
2010). After the Cronulla riots in December 2005,
Sydneysiders risk perceptions escalated from the threat of
further violence to terrorism. In an effort to restore social
order, the government introduced legislative changes that
increased police powers; hence, the text messages used to
promote and expedite the Cronulla riots became a target of
police surveillance. The general reactions to the policing
of text messaging were crude links to the wide-ranging risk
perceptions situated within a culture of fear. To provide a
theoretical framework for these risk perceptions, Anthony
Gidden's ontological security is explored to offer empiri-
cal examples of the distinction between reality and possi-
bility, which are the bases for all risk perceptions (Beck,
1992; Wilkinson, 2001a, 2001b, and 2010). This paper
argues in order to manage fear in a present or perceived
threat individuals are disposed to mediate any actual or
perceived risks by bracketing out anxieties in order to
manage their everyday lives.
Background: The Cronulla riots
To understand the risk perceptions that existed during this
time, a background of the Cronulla riots is essential.
Cronulla Beach is situated on Sydney's south coast; it is the
only Sydney beach on the metropolitan railway system and
is easily accessible by train or car from the Western sub-
urbs. These suburbs of Sydney are historically lower socio-
economic areas and friction between Cronulla "locals" and
Western suburbs "outsiders," particularly on the beachfront
has a turbulent past (Morgan, 2005, 2007; Poynting, 2007,
2009). On the afternoon of Sunday 4th December 2005, an
altercation occurred on Cronulla Beach between four young

Balancing Trust and Anxiety in a Culture
of Fear: Text Messaging and Riots
Jayde Cahir1
Abstract
To date, there is no empirical research on the risk perceptions of Sydneysiders following the Cronulla riots nor are there
any connections made between risk perceptions and ontological security in the mobile communication literature. This article
addresses this gap by exploring the risk perceptions of individuals in the wake of these riots, specifically, their reactions
to the new surveillance measures and policing of text messaging. This qualitative study uses empirical data collected from
30 one-on-one interviews conducted 12 to 16 months after the riots. To provide a theoretical framework for these risk
perceptions Anthony Giddens' notion of ontological security, the inner balance between trust and anxiety is used. The data
analysis shows that while individuals risk perceptions are complex and contradictory, they use a range of methods to create
a balance between trust and anxiety. This article argues that to manage fear in a present or perceived threat, individuals are
disposed to mediate any actual or perceived risks by bracketing out anxieties to manage their everyday lives.

men and three off-duty volunteer lifesavers (Evers, 2009;
Michaels, 2006; Poynting, 2007, 2009; The Daily Telegraph,
2005). Strong, coarse language was used by both groups of
men and physical aggression followed, resulting in one life-
saver sustaining a cut near his eye and the other two suffer-
ing facial bruising (Lawrence & Gee, 2005; Poynting,
2009). In newspaper reports, the four young men were posi-
tioned as the perpetrators of this attack and were described
as being "of Middle Eastern appearance" (Lawrence &
Gee, 2005; Malkin, Tadros, & Kennedy, 2005; McIlveen &
Jones, 2005). The label "of Middle Eastern appearance" has
a history of use in Australian broadcast media dating back
to the late 1990s and peaking in the aftermath of the terror-
ist attacks in New York on 11th September 2001 (Collins,
Noble, Poynting, & Tabar, 2000; Poynting, Noble, Tabar, &
Collins, 2004). This relatively unremarkable squabble
between seven young men at Cronulla Beach resulted in an
outpour of public indignation. Commencing on Monday
5th December, popular commercial media demanded a
tough crackdown on "the `Middle Eastern' assailants"
(Poynting, 2007, p. 159). Radio talkback programs, news-
paper editorials, opinion pieces, and letters to the editor all
contributed to the rising hysteria (ACMA, 2007; Jones,
2005; Poynting, 2007, 2009); at the same time, chain text
messages and emails began to circulate summoning
Australian "patriots" for a "Leb and wog bashing day"
(McIlveen, 2005, p. 39; Morgan, 2007, p. 144; Lattas, 2007,
p. 321; Poynting, 2009, p. 46). On 10th December, NSW
State Police Commissioner Ken Moroney issued a state-
ment saying that there would be no tolerance of antisocial
or violent behavior, and advised everyone to ignore text
messages and emails enlisting people to attend Cronulla
Beach the following day. In this public statement, Police
Commissioner Ken Moroney said that his officers had
launched an investigation into who was responsible for ini-
tiating the chain text messages (Australian Broadcasting
Corporation [ABC], 2005a; Moroney, 2005).
On Sunday 11th December, the words "100% Aussie
Pride" were marked out in the sand at North Cronulla Beach
(Morgan, 2005; Taylor, 2009). Five thousand people report-
edly gathered at the site, encouraged by the week's events
and fuelled by sun and alcohol, the crowd marched through
the streets of Cronulla, attacking anyone who they identified
as "Middle Eastern" (Morgan, 2005; Poynting, 2007). One
victim recalled how the violence erupted when a man deemed
to be "of Middle Eastern appearance" was walking along the
beachfront with his girlfriend and "two girls turned around
and screamed . . . `get off our f__king beaches'[and then] the
whole street turned on them" (M. Brown, 2005, p. 7). Police
officers recollected how one young man was badly beaten
after having bottles smashed across his back, and they found
another man lying in a pool of blood (Overington & Warne-
Smith, 2005). The violent rampage continued, and by the
afternoon, it was reported that at least 13 people had been
injured and 12 had been arrested (Kennedy, Murphy, Brown,
& Colquhoun, 2005).
After Sunday 11th December, text messages sent and
received in the days before the violence were labelled "mes-
sages that incited violence" in Australian newspaper reports
and positioned as an "uncontrolled" broadcast system (ABC,
2005b; Lawrence & Gee, 2005; McIlveen, 2005; McIlveen
& Jones, 2005; Pearlman, Paine, & Baker, 2005) and the ini-
tial response from the NSW State Government was to
increase police powers. On 15th December 2005, amend-
ments to the Law Enforcement Legislation (Public Safety)
Act 2005 No. 119 were presented and passed through the
NSW State Legislative Council (NSW Parliament
Transcripts, 2005). These emergency powers for police
included the ability to
seize and detain, for a period of no more than 7 days, a vehicle,
mobile phone or other communication device if the seizure and
detention of the vehicle, phone or device will assist in preventing
or controlling a public disorder . . . The Local Court may, on the
application of a police officer, authorise the continued detention
of a vehicle, mobile phone or other communication device . . .
for an additional period not exceeding 14 days if satisfied that its
continued detention will assist in preventing or controlling a
public disorder. (NSW Legislation, 2005, p. 10)
In the week before the Cronulla riots, another form of sur-
veillance to monitor text messages was initiated by the
Australian Federal Government and Federal Police. Special
police units were given access to text messages stored on the
servers of telecommunication network providers through the
Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored
Communications) Act 2004 (ComLaw, 2004, No 148, section
3), which defined stored communication as
a communication that is stored on equipment or any other thing,
but does not include:
(a) a voice over Internet protocol (VOIP) communication; or
(b) any other communication; stored on a highly transitory basis
as an integral function of the technology used in its transmission.
The design of the text message system supports this form
of surveillance. Text messaging is a store-and-forward ser-
vice: A text message is not sent directly to the recipient's
mobile phone. Instead, the message is stored on the Short
Message Service Centre (SMSC), for days if necessary, until
the recipient turns the mobile phone on or moves into range,
at which point the message is delivered (Hillebrand, 2002;
Trosby, 2004). The storage of text messages on the SMSC
provides easy access for those wishing to monitor their con-
tent. Access to text messages on the SMSC is technically
uncomplicated, but permissions for this access still depend
on obtaining an Interception Warrant.
Cahir 3
The Interception Warrant for National Safety issues can only be
issued by the Attorney General . . . Warrants issued for the
interception of any communication medium, are provided only
[once authorities have] confirmed the extent of the offence and
are convinced that all other methods of surveillance have been
duly exhausted. (SS8 Networks, 2007, p. 7)
It was not until after the Cronulla riots that this process
was revealed as applying to text messages stored on telecom-
munication servers.
During the Cronulla events more than 270,000 SMS messages
were obtained from the carriers and analysed. It was only then
that the names of those involved and their service numbers could
be determined. By accessing messages without the knowledge
of the sender or receiver, police were able to arrest those who
were inciting violence or about to commit crimes. (Australian
IT, 2007; The Sydney Morning Herald, 2007)
This quote from a media report published on two online
sites relates to the authority of the Telecommunications
(Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Act
2004. These amendments allowed law enforcement agen-
cies to analyze the time and date of phone calls and the con-
tent of text messages as "stored communication" with the
carriers, without the knowledge of sender or receiver
(Telecommunications [Interception] Amendment [Stored
Communications] Act 2004; SS8 Networks, 2007, p. 5).
More than a quarter of a million text messages were obtained
from the telecommunication carriers before, during, and
after the Cronulla riots, although this figure does not repre-
sent the number actually subjected to this form of surveil-
lance, which could be considerably higher. The news reports
also signify that the text messages in question were recorded
and stored within other systems, such as police records, to
be used as evidence against those responsible for sending
"messages that incited violence." Subsequent arrests were
made as a result of this form of surveillance. Twelve days
after the riot, police made their first arrest, when a 33-year-
old man was charged with using "a carrier service to menace
and harass" as well as "publish to incite a crime" (Box &
Stapleton, 2005, p. 1; Burke & Cubby, 2005, p. 7). In
February 2006, police made three more arrests for using a
telecommunication carrier to harass and offend (Australian
Associated Press [AAP], 2006a, 2006b). The legislation that
supports this surveillance technique and the material infra-
structures that enable it effectively established that individu-
als are accountable for their communications.
Literature Review: Text Messaging,
Risk Perceptions, and Ontological
Security
There are many academic texts that have focused on explor-
ing the social and cultural dimensions of mobile phones and
text messaging in various everyday contexts with ample
attention given to young people (B. Brown, Green, & Harper,
2001; Glotz et al., 2005; Goggin, 2006, 2008; Green &
Haddon, 2009; Harper et al., 2005; Ito et al., 2005;
Kasesniemi, 2003; Katz, 2005, 2008; Katz & Aahkus, 2002;
Kavoori & Arceneaux, 2006; Kopomaa, 2000; Ling, 2004,
2008; Pertierra, Ugarte, Pingol, Hermandez, & Decanay,
2002). There are also many research studies which have
explored the notion of accountability in mobile communica-
tions (see Green, cited in B. Brown et al., 2001), the chal-
lenges mobile communications present to government
authorities (Agar, 2003; Goggin, 2006; Pertierra et al., 2002;
Rheingold, 2002), and the risks attached to the overuse of
mobile communications, with a particular focus on health
and public safety (see Ling, 2004; Goggin, 2006; Green &
Haddon, 2009; Lai, 2012). Despite this significant attention
to mobile communications, there are only a few studies that
have predominantly focused on text messaging and chal-
lenges to government authorities (Hirsch & Henry, 2005),
the most famous being Txt-ing Selves: Cellphone and
Philippine Modernity (Pertierra et al., 2002). There are also
only a few short reflections and analysis on the Cronulla riots
and "the messages that incited violence" (see Goggin, 2006,
pp. 124-125; Lattas, 2007, p. 321; Poynting, 2009, p. 46);
however, to date, there is no empirical research on the risk
perceptions of Sydneysiders following these riots nor are
there any connections made between risk perceptions and
ontological security in the mobile communication literature.
The following paragraphs will explore research on text mes-
saging and how it has posed threats to government control,
risk perception literature, and Anthony Giddens' notion of
ontological security.
It is often celebrated that mobile phones open communi-
cation possibilities, as their inherent mobility means that
conversations can happen "anywhere, anytime." It is equally
significant to observe that opening up communication pos-
sibilities has on occasion presented challenges to the state
and its authorities. A well-publicized international example
of such a case was when Filipino people began to gather at
Epifanio de los Santas Avenue (EDSA) in Manila, sum-
moned by the text message "go 2EDSA, wear blck" (Pertierra
et al., 2002, p. 107; Rheingold, 2002, pp. 157-158; Agar,
2003, pp. 108-110). This chain text message was sent to
organize and coordinate a protest rally against the Filipino
Government during President Joseph Estrada's impeachment
trial. According to popular belief, "text power" was respon-
sible for the eventual demise of the Estrada government
(Rheingold, 2002, p. 157; Agar, 2003, pp. 108-110); how-
ever, the social unarrest was present before the text messag-
ing campaign. The contribution of text messaging in EDSA,
similar to the Cronulla riots, was its capacity to expedite the
arrangement of the masses (Goggin, 2006; Pertierra et al.,
2002), which has posed various challenges to governments
and authorities, particularly when used by large numbers of
people in unison. The use of mobile technologies can chal-
lenge how information is distributed and controlled, as a
4 SAGE Open
digitally written discourse generated through mobile phones,
whether it is through Internet or the store-forward-service of
text messaging, leaves traces of conversations on all the
technological devices the message encounters. In the United
Kingdom, records of mobile phones use are kept and in
exceptional circumstances can be used by State authorities in
criminal cases through the Data Protection Act 1998 (Green,
2001). One of the most recent illustrations of this practice is
the 2011 London riots and the use of Blackberry messenger
(BBM). These messages were widely reported as being
"untraceable"; however, Research in Motion (owners of
Blackberry) reportedly surrendered BBMs to the Scotland
Yard in an effort to control the coordination of further vio-
lence (Dodd & Davies, 2011; Prodhan & Sharp, 2011). These
reports illustrate that the extension of police powers was bur-
ied within the language of "risk," which Wilkinson asserts is
strategic measure "for the purpose of refining techniques of
surveillance and social control" (2010, p. 84).
Adiscourse-historical approach to key political crises in the
last millennium shows a repetition of the same tactics to unite
the populous (Graham, Keenan, & Dowd, 2004). When social
solidarity is placed under some kind of threat, people react by
evoking shared beliefs about an impending disaster (Beck,
1992; Douglas & Wildavsky, 1982; Furedi, 2002;Graham
et al., 2004; Wilkinson, 2001a, 2001b). Since the terrorist
attacks in technologically advanced global cities of New York,
Madrid, and London, methods of surveillance have expanded
(Arvanitakis, 2008; Mason, 2006), which is justified by the
rhetoric that "increasingly taps into individualised insecurities
and fears" (Mythen & Walklate, 2006). The wider ramification
of this broad insecurity is an explosion of anxieties that
become embedded to form a culture of fear and uncertainty
(Furedi, 2002; Mythen & Walklate, 2006). The Cronulla riot is
a case in point. The violence on 11th December 2005 at
Cronulla was linked to wayward text messaging practices;
moreover, the racist slants in the text messages, the broadcast
media representations, and the public reactions crudely con-
nected this violent behavior to terrorism. The rhetoric of
"keeping up" with changes in technology to fight terrorism
was the Australian Government's justification for changing
the laws to increase police powers and to access and intercept
text messages (Grubel, 2006).
The perpetuation of a risk society relies upon the concept
of risk being bound to modernization and the insecurities
induced by it (Beck, 1992). Social scientists like Ulrich Beck
have been criticized for not embarking on an empirical inves-
tigation of the reality of risk perception (Wilkinson, 2001a,
2001b). Empirical data from risk perception research reveals
it to be considerably more complex and obscure than Beck
portrays in his seminal "risk society" thesis (Wilkinson,
2001a, p. 5). There is evidence that the heightened anxieties
of "late twentieth-century society [are] . . . connected with
the extent that we are becoming more risk conscious"
(Wilkinson, 2001a, p. 5). Content analysis of Western news-
papers in the 1990s found that the word "risk" was used as a
synonym for "hazards," "threats," and "disasters" (Lupton,
1999, pp. 9-10). The broadcast media's attention to `risk'
may have contributed to a risk conscious society, but it is
more likely an expression of anxiety than of risk conscious-
ness. However, Wilkinson (2001a) asserts it is debatable to
conclude that `society is more anxious because it is more risk
conscious' (p. 8).The anxious condition of individuals in
modern society has been interpreted as "a product of the
social conflicts and cultural contradictions which comprise
their experience of day-to-day life" (Wilkinson, 2001a, p. 9).
To provide a theoretical framework for these risk perceptions
Anthony Giddens' notion of ontological security, the inner
balance between trust and anxiety will be explored.
Ontological security is a central but small component of
Giddens' (1990, 1991) theoretical basis for understanding
sociality and modernity. In its broadest sense, ontological
security is "the confidence that most human beings have in
the continuity of their self-identity and in the constancy of
the social and material environments of action" (Giddens,
1990, p. 92). Giddens defines security as resting between "a
balance of trust and acceptable risk" (1990, p. 36), with onto-
logical security being just one form of security, albeit a "very
important form" (1990, p. 92). Ontological security is an
emotional experience and situated within the unconscious,
but its source lies within a sense of "being." Ontological
security, therefore, is "an emotional inoculation which pro-
tects against existential anxieties to which all humans are
potentially subject" (1990, p. 94). It must be understood pre-
dominantly in the "context of trust and forms of risk or dan-
ger," as it acts as an anxiety-controlling barrier (Giddens,
1990, p. 100). Giddens articulates ontological security as a
"defensive carapace" or a "protective cocoon" that allows
individuals to detach themselves from risks or dangers, thus
"screening off" anxieties associated with day-to-day life
(Giddens, 1991, pp. 39-40). Thus, individuals screen off any
negative possibilities in favor of "a generalised feeling of
hope that derives from basic trust." Basic trust is considered
foundational to ontological security, operating as a defensive
carapace to any thoughts that might cause distress (1991, p.
40). Anything that disrupts the practical consciousness that
anchors feelings of ontological security is rationalized
through the natural attitude, a tacit acceptance, that "brackets
out questions about self, other and the object world which
have to be taken for granted in order to keep up with every-
day activity" (Giddens, 1991, p. 37).
Research Method: Exploring
Participants Attitudes and Perceptions
of Text Messaging
This is a qualitative study. The aim was not to draw statistical
conclusions; instead, the study intended to produce nuanced
understandings of how people use text messaging to com-
municate with their social networks in everyday life.
Experience is central for studying and researching everyday
Cahir 5
life (Pickering, 2008), although it is acknowledged that anal-
ysis of an individual's experience can be troublesome as it is
never pure or transparent. To balance this, three methodolog-
ical approaches were used: dialogic, deconstructive, and
contextual. This approach to empirical research lies in the
interplay between lived experience, discourses, and the
social context, which are always representative of more than
one lived reality (Saukko 2003). The chosen method of data
collection was one-on-one interviews; prerequisites for
inclusion in the sample were knowledge of how to send and
receive text messages, age between 18 and 40 years, and liv-
ing in Sydney. According to Silverman (2000), qualitative
methods like one-on-one interviews "exemplify a common
belief that they can provide a deeper understanding of social
phenomena that would be obtained from a purely quantita-
tive data" (p. 80). This particular form of data collection was
selected to gain a "thicker description" and to bring to light
the many subtle contradictions of the sociocultural dimen-
sions of everyday text messaging practices (Geertz, 1973).
During a 5-month period, 17 women and 13 men (Table
1) were recruited using two forms of nonprobability sam-
pling: convenience and snowballing. To keep the sample to a
manageable size, 30 one-on-one interviews were conducted
using an interview guide to stimulate conversation about
each research participant's text messaging experiences, prac-
tices, and opinions about the technology. The same topics
were raised in each interview, but as the interviews were
based on open-ended questions, their durations ranged
between 30 min and 2 hrs.
The interviews were transcribed and coded initially under
four broad categories: convenience, privacy, regulation, and
safety. In using the three methodological approaches--
dialogic, deconstructive, and contextual--it is essential to be
aware of any bias through continual reflection, sensitivity
toward social contexts, and an awareness that social worlds
are constantly shaped by the historical and political (Saukko,
2003). After reflecting on this initial analysis, the interview
transcripts were re-coded to explore an extension of the orig-
inal four categories as it became evident that the research
participants' comments were shaped by wide-ranging social
and cultural influences (Saukko, 2003), particularly when
discussing text messaging and the Cronulla riots (see the
appendix). When the conversation turned to this topic, there
was evidence of a balancing act between trust and anxiety in
the research participants' comments. This article is represen-
tative of this aspect, specifically, the discussion and analysis
of the research participants' responses to the recent changes
in Australian law. This research was conducted between 12
and 16 months after the Cronulla riots; however, the social
context was still a fresh memory for the research partici-
pants. In each interview, an explanation was given regarding
the new amendments to NSW State and Commonwealth law.
The NSW Law Enforcement Legislation (Public Safety) Act
(No. 119, 2005), and in Commonwealth law, amendments
were made to the Telecommunication (Interception and
Access) Act 2006 (ComLaw, 2006). During the research
interviews, participants were asked for their opinions on the
amendments to State and Commonwealth laws and the polic-
ing of text messaging. In the following sections, the research
participants' responses and comments are analyzed using the
theoretical framework of ontological security to enrich an
understanding of risk perceptions in a climate of fear and
uncertainty. As Michael Pickering (2008) argues, theory pro-
vides an understanding of how social worlds are configured,
but unless these experiences are explored, there are no
insights into the lived and living landscapes to which the
theory relates.
"It Is Absolutely a Good Thing":
Policing Text Messages
In all the interviews, the topic of the text messaging system
was discussed. Some participants confirmed they knew that
their messages could be accessed by their service provider;
either through personal experience, knowledge of the new
surveillance laws, or understanding of how the store-forward

system functions. A few participants openly expressed dis-
comfort in thinking about the new laws or any form of poten-
tial monitoring. The most extreme example was Dave, who
chose to completely disengage by asking "Can we go to the
next question please?" Disengaging from the discussion or
from even thinking about an issue is an overt form of "brack-
eting out" anything that is the cause of uneasiness. A more
subtle form of bracketing was seen in pragmatic rationales,
one example of which was Olivia's response:
Yes [pause] I don't really think about it too much, I mean I don't
put really private information in there but obviously people
don't delve into your business or your own private affairs.
In using text messaging for daily communications,
Olivia does not think "too much" about her service provider
having access to her text messages, but at the same time,
she does not put "private information" in text messages.
This daily practice suggests that she is conscious of the pos-
sibility of surveillance. Olivia's comment evidences a
"defensive carapace," in trying not to think about surveil-
lance practices as well as in her conviction that information
about her private life remains uncompromised. Her stance
of "invulnerability" blocks any negative possibilities, in
favor of a generalized attitude that derives from "basic
trust," the foundation to ontological security (Giddens,
1991, p. 40).
"Basic trust" operates as a defensive carapace; thus, if any
thoughts disrupt a sense of stability, barriers are set in place.
In the research, participants' matter-of-fact responses to the
knowledge that telecommunication companies have access
to text messages revealed this demarcation.
John: I don't mind because they are not going to check my
messages, I think, I hope, because they have so many customers.
I mean they may pick people randomly but because I do statistics
I know the chance of them picking me is very small.
So what about word searches?
John: I don't know.
John relies upon his knowledge of statistics that gives his
rationale a groundedness, but the thought of computerized
word searches is dismissed with a simple reply of "I don't
know" to end the conversation. To manage day-to-day life,
individuals' main emotional support is a "defensive cara-
pace": Feelings of security rely firmly upon "basic trust" that
functions by "screening off" any "risks or dangers in the sur-
rounding settings of action and interaction" (Giddens, 1991,
pp. 39-40). Here, John achieves stability in the surrounding
social and material environment by actively placing a defen-
sive carapace against certain thoughts (Giddens, 1991). In
general, the participants' uneasiness in thinking about the
new surveillance measures was shown in their simple dis-
missal or rationalization of the measures as applying only to
terrorists or other criminals. The demarcation therefore is the
distancing of self from the any form of surveillance.
Being "at risk"
is subject to a variety of influences . . . social and cultural climate
[being one] . . . many panics or overreactions . . . provide
interesting insights to how society makes sense of itself. Such
reactions can only be understood in relation to the wider social
processes. (Furedi, 2002, p. 17)
In this social context, the violence at Cronulla and the
way it was organized using a number of communication
mediums (although text messages were the focus of most
media reports) meant that people felt safer knowing that text
messaging was being policed.
Sylvia: I think that it is a good thing. If they can do anything to
stop the violence, if it helps people stay out of trouble, then I
think that it is absolutely a good thing.
Sylvia's comment was a response to the "stop and search"
surveillance technique used after the Cronulla riots. The
NSW State Police action of randomly searching people's
mobile phones was an effort to discipline the wayward text
messaging practices after the riots. Sylvia's opinion that this
was "absolutely a good thing" denotes her belief that this
form of policing would somehow make everyone safer. Her
repetitive statement "that is a good thing . . . that is absolutely
a good thing" suggests that the policing of text messages
appeases her anxiety about further violence. The salient
aspect of Sylvia's comment is not so much fear or insecurity
about further rioting but her conservative attitude. It is noted
that often analysis of risk "does not make a connection
between the preoccupation with safety and the impulse of
conservatism [as a consequence] safety and the attitude of
caution are treated as inherently positive principles" (Furedi,
2002, p. 9).
In a period of uncertainty, people fear any form of risk
(Furedi, 2002), and chain text messages were seen as putting
people at risk. As outlined, young men "of Middle Eastern
appearance" were linked to a range of threats, terrorism
being one of those. This had a cumulative effect of increas-
ing the imagined risk and threatening stability and certainty
(Arvanitakis, 2008). Safety was a prime consideration for the
research participants when discussing the Cronulla riots and
the formal surveillance measures.
Will: I don't mind it. Obviously with the Cronulla riots, the text
messages going round didn't really help anything. So I guess, if
they were able to track who, I don't know, the organisers or
whatever, through text messaging I was quite happy about that.
Will's comment shows satisfaction with this form of sur-
veillance, relating not only to the policing of text messages
but also to the knowledge that they could be traced and used
as evidence. His expression "quite happy" denotes a curt
Cahir 7
emotional experience. It can also be likened to an affective
state, a feeling of being happy because the materiality of text
messaging allows it be used as a trace. This particular use of
text messages by police could promote stability and coher-
ence, a settled feeling that contrasts with the occasional
chaos in social worlds. As Giddens asserts, ontological secu-
rity is "an emotional inoculation which protects against exis-
tential anxieties" (1990, p. 94). According to these research
participants, the policing measures appeased anxieties about
public safety by seemingly assuring a broader sense of secu-
rity and certainty.
"Yeah, Anything to Stop Terrorism":
Mapping Risk Perceptions
The surveillance measures sanctioned through the
Telecommunication (Interception and Access) Act prompted
many of the research participants to link this form of policing
with terrorism or other criminal activities. Some participants
used the words terrorist, terrorism, or terrorist activities to
explain why these surveillance measures were necessary. In
their responses, a process of "bracketing" was evident, as
some participants were convinced that the amendments to
the law would have no impact on them but instead would
allow monitoring of illegal activities. John's comment here
evidences his "defensive carapace" as he expresses a sense
of disbelief that anyone would scrutinize his text messages:
John: I am not a terrorist so who would be interested in any of
the messages that I send?
The "invulnerability" expressed in this comment is like a
protective cocoon rather than a firm conviction of security; it
is a defense against any possibility that could threaten or
cause discomfort. John's differentiation allows him to
"bracket out a host of actual and potential happenings"
(Giddens, 1991, p. 128). Isolating himself from any kind of
suspicion by concluding that formal surveillance would tar-
get only terrorists, John, like many of the participants,
equates access and interception of text messages exclusively
with terrorist or other criminal activities.
Chantal: I knew that it was something that they could do but it is
not something that I consider because most of my texts are
pretty mundane. It is not like I am organizing terrorist activities.
To maintain a sense of security and stability in individuals
or surrounding environments, a certain level of positiveness
is required (Giddens, 1991). This is seen in Chantal's com-
ment as she makes a joke about her text messages being
monitored. In his analysis of "adaptive reactions" to risk,
Giddens (1990) analyzes, "pragmatic acceptance" which
involves not withdrawal from the outside world but "prag-
matic participation" that focuses on day-to-day difficulties
and tasks (1990, p. 135). It is John's and Chantal's basic trust
in the law and the actions of the authorities that sustains the
notion that any form of policing text messages functions to
safeguard against terrorist activities. This was the dominant
position taken by the research participants.
A sense of being at risk, according to Furedi, "has become
a permanent condition that exists separately from any par-
ticular problem" (2002, p. 5). Risk is often discussed and
referenced in "sweeping terms" which transforms the notion
into an independent and ubiquitous force, ultimately convert-
ing any human experience into a "safety situation" (Furedi,
2002, p. 5). When discussing Cronulla and new regulations
for text messaging, the participants in this study produced a
spectrum of different interpretations of how text messaging
was a threat to public safety. The consensus in their responses
was that risks existed in the form of terrorism or other crimi-
nal activities, bullying or other forms of harassment, and thus
open surveillance was deemed necessary. In Wilkinson's
analysis of risk perception, he states that people may express
a pessimistic view about risks in society, but the majority of
people will not relate it to their own lives (2001a). In the
participants' responses, this was mostly the case. This accep-
tance of the new surveillance laws by the participants is an
expression of ontological security as they bracket off any
potential threat to their safety, not only through basic trust
but also by applying the risks to others. For example, during
Cameron's interview, the Cronulla riots and how the police
used the "stop and search" technique to check people's
mobile phones for "messages that incited violence" were dis-
cussed, and he said:
Cameron: I think that is good. Yeah anything to stop terrorism
and rioting or acts of violence is good.
So you wouldn't care if the police said that they wanted to check
your phone?
Cameron: Yeah I would care because I haven't done anything
wrong. I would find it an invasion of privacy but I think that it
is good that they can and I wish that they would go through
more . . . messages . . . anything that will stop acts of violence.
In the context of Cronulla riots, this police action seemed
a necessary safety measure to Cameron, but when asked
about his response to the police potentially checking his
mobile phone, his position changed. Wilkinson (2001a)
argues that risk perception can be so abstract that people
often dissociate themselves from the process. Thus, Cameron
finds it an "invasion of privacy" but also believes it is "good"
that police can monitor text messaging practices. In this case,
Cameron relates the risk of an invasion of privacy to others
who used text messages to incite violence but not to himself.
Within the wide spectrum of diversity in participants' com-
ments, this was the only other dominant agreement, namely,
that text messages are a record of a dialogue and could there-
fore be used as evidence that a conversation or an event took
8 SAGE Open
place, but this accountability attached to text messaging
communications was not necessarily connected to their
everyday lives.
Awareness of the potential use of text messages as a form
of evidence reveals the participants' internalization of the
traceability of this digitally written discourse. There is a
sense of safety in knowing that text messages are monitored
and an innate belief that such monitoring will always be used
for the common good.
Michelle: If there was a criminal case and you could prove
something through a text message then [long pause] yeah gosh I
guess at the moment it feels really safe . . . but if that started to
change and there were cases of people being violated or some
kind of abuse . . . If that was to happen then yes I think, like in
cases of abuse, harassment . . . like when relationships have
gone into that really bad space like when one of the partners is
constantly texting or if there have been threats or if it is used for
any sort of racist things or at schools with bullying.
Michelle contextualizes her response to the new laws
through potential cases of abuse or harassment, demonstrat-
ing a positive stance about the surveillance of text messages.
In Giddens' lexicon, this position would amount to "prag-
matic acceptance" as it seemingly relieves the burden of
anxiety (1990, p. 133). Michelle separates herself from this
situation that "at the moment it feels really safe," but in her
description of the potential danger of text messages, she is
articulating anxieties as well as appeasing them with the
thought that the text can be used to "prove something."
Correspondingly, Olivia advocates open surveillance when
discussing the policing of text messaging:
Olivia: Yeah, just because there are so many threats now, it has to
be open. The same as phone tapping and all of that . . . [there is]
a point where it does need to be something that people can trace.
Olivia's comment speaks to one of Furedi's (2002) central
arguments "that the perception of being at risk expresses a per-
vasive mood in society [which] influences action" (2002,
p. 20). Furedi describes a "free-floating" risk consciousness
that is attached to everyday experiences, which combats a
potential threat with a safety measure (2002, p. 20). Olivia's
belief that "there are so many threats now" and her assertion
that there needs to be a "trace" of conversations links the vio-
lence at Cronulla with the notion of formal surveillance in the
interest of public safety. A "generalised climate of risk,"
Giddens asserts, becomes "a source of unspecific anxieties"
for most people (1991, pp. 181-208). This is the ideal environ-
ment for the acceptance of increased surveillance measures.
"I've Got Nothing to Hide": Safety in
Surveillance
One of the most common responses to idea of formal surveil-
lance of text messages was the attitude--"I've got nothing to
hide." This is not a unique finding; other studies on changes
to privacy laws have reported a similar rhetoric (Solove,
2007). "I've got nothing to hide" is a defensive carapace
based on the proposal that if you have nothing to hide, you
would have no problem with formal surveillance measures.
A few participants used the exact phrase "I've got nothing to
hide," and other participants' comments complemented this
stance by arguing that the surveillance measures concerned
only criminals or terrorists. The significance of this position
is that it denotes the fusion between anxieties and the partici-
pants' expressions of ontological security in an environment
of heighten fear (Furedi, 2002, 2005). Susanne's comment is
a synthesis of this:
Susanne: I have no problems with it because I have nothing to
hide and I think in the [Cronulla] situation that was absolutely
right. I think that it is the same as anything isn't it, like if the
police want to pull you over and search your vehicle then they
have every right to do that and so they should. It's in the interest
of public safety. So yeah I don't have any problems with that, I
think that it is more than appropriate in this day and age.
Furedi argues that fear dominates public life; he asserts
that "we have become very good at scaring one another and
being scared" (2005, p. 1). Policing text messages, according
to Susanne, is "more than appropriate in this day and age,"
and her comment suggests that society is unsafe in compari-
son with the past. Susanne's comment indicates that she has
internalized a fear about potentially being unsafe, thus she
supports the formal surveillance of text messages, arguing
that it is "in the interest of public safety." In this approach,
she simultaneously expresses anxiety about not being safe
and assurance that these laws do not apply to her because she
has "nothing to hide." In justifying the recent change in the
law, Susanne likens the formal surveillance of text messages
to the "stop and search" technique of other personal posses-
sions. Morgan also relies on this claim to validate the exten-
sion of police powers:
Morgan: I guess [it's] the same as having a search warrant, to
search the house, and to search someone's belongings. I think
it's ok. I've got nothing to hide.
Equating the formal surveillance measures of text mes-
saging to other surveillance techniques provides a sense of
familiarity and security. Morgan's "natural attitude," "I've
got nothing to hide," also indicates that she believes these
changes to legislation do not apply to her. Solove (2007)
cites a range of rhetoric associated with the "I have nothing
to hide" argument, one of the most compelling is underlying
this phrase an individualized attitude "I don't care what hap-
pens so long as it doesn't happen to me" (p. 751). Susanne's
and Morgan's approach to surveillance is similar to Mirko
Bagaric's argument that "if you have done nothing wrong,
you have nothing to fear . . . Privacy is often no more than
code for the `rights to secrecy,' which is destructive of an
Cahir 9
open and free society" (Bagaric, 2008, p. 22). The "nothing
to hide argument" essentially rests within the rationale that
"there is no threat to privacy unless the government uncovers
unlawful activity, in which case a person has no legitimate
justification to claim that it remain private" (Solove, 2007, p.
745). While this argument, its history, and critique extend
beyond the boundaries of this article, it highlights the balanc-
ing of "risks." Being safe, the feeling of being safe, trumps
any threat to privacy. Balancing trust and anxiety requires the
research participants to have confidence the new surveil-
lance laws, while creating a barrier between them and the
implementation of any surveillance techniques. Cameron
states a comparable position:
Cameron: Oh yeah it is an invasion of privacy but if they want
to be that pathetic and read the messages that I am sending then
[laughs] I think the only time that you would be concerned is
that if you are doing something dodgy. I don't do anything
dodgy . . . so it doesn't really worry me.
A crucial part of maintaining ontological security is reli-
ance on deflecting any potential risks by adopting an outlook
of "what could go wrong?" thereby pushing any doubts out of
mind (Giddens, 1991, p. 129). Cameron casually refers to pri-
vacy being jeopardized through formal surveillance of text
messages but simultaneously claims that the likelihood of
some authority going through his text messages is minimal.
He laughs while making this comment, using humor to ratio-
nalize how people would only need privacy if they were doing
something unlawful. While saying this Cameron describes any
potential interest in his text messages as "pathetic"; this is
another form of a defensive carapace against any thoughts that
may arouse anxiety (Giddens, 1990, 1991).
Conclusion
This article argued to manage fear in a present or perceived
threat individuals are disposed to mediate any actual or per-
ceived risks by bracketing out anxieties to manage their
everyday lives. The empirical analysis provided an under-
standing of the complex, and sometimes contradictory, bal-
ance between trust and anxiety. The research participants'
reactions to the policing of text messages revealed how they
either bracket out anything that is the cause of uneasiness by
offering pragmatic or matter-of-fact responses as a defensive
carapace (Giddens, 1990, 1991). Disengagement from wider
political processes, such as the ever-expanding forms of sur-
veillance and how that facilitates accountability for all digi-
tal discourse, highlights the approach of a predominantly
anxious society. Equally, the generalized attitude of accep-
tance derives from "basic trust" which is the foundation of
ontological security (Giddens, 1990, 1991). While disen-
gagement and acceptance could be considered as binary
opposites, both display the spectrum of an emotional
response to any perceived risk.
Opening up communication possibilities through text
messaging has produced another form of surveillance as this
store-forward service leaves traces of conversations on all
the technological devices the message encounters. The
research participants in this study did not show concern
about the surveillance of their words nor the extension of the
law enforcement legislation to include mobile phones. In
fact, the trust they placed in the authorities balanced any
anxieties about further threats to public safety. The policing
of text messages was linked by many of the research partici-
pants' to terrorism, thus the expansion of surveillance was
rationalized as a necessary safety measure. Risk perceptions
are often contradictory; as Wilkinson (2001a) argues, many
people express a pessimistic view about risks in society, but
the majority of people will not relate it to their own lives.
This was the case in this study as the research participants
again produced a range of "adaptive reactions to risk"
(Giddens, 1990, p. 135) expressed as invulnerability, posi-
tiveness and a reliance upon the discourse "I have nothing to
hide," which is commonly attached to privacy and surveil-
lance debates.
A sense of being at risk is subject to a variety of social
influences the social and cultural climate being one (Furedi,
2002) accordingly the timing of this research is significant as
it was only 12 to 16 months after the Cronulla riots. The
research participants' comments indicate that concerns for
public safety were paramount and the empirical analysis
demonstrated how various expressions of ontological secu-
rity act as an anxiety-controlling barrier (Giddens, 1990).
While this article presented an empirical based study that
addressed a gap in mobile communication literature by
exploring the relationship between risk perceptions, onto-
logical security, and text messaging, future research could
investigate gender and risk perceptions, understandings of
privacy in relation to text messaging and the public and pri-
vate dimensions in mobile communication technologies con-
sidering this research outlines the impact text messaging has
on notions of surveillance and public space.
