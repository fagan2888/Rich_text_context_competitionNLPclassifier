Introduction.The geriatric functional measures and syndromes collected 5 years apart in Waves 1 and 2 of the
National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) data set included: difficulty with activities of daily living and
instrumental activities of daily living, the timed up and go, a 3-m timed walk, repeated chair stands, self-reported physical
activity, accelerometry-assessed (in)activity, falls, fractures, and frailty. The purpose of this paper was to describe the data
collection methods and report preliminary population estimates for each measures.
Method. Frequencies, means, or medians were estimated for each measure stratified by age and gender, using the
age-eligible samples in Wave 1 (n = 3,005) and Wave 2 (n = 3,196). An adapted phenotypic frailty scale was constructed
in the sample common to both waves (n = 2,261). Changes over 5 years were reported for four measures common to
both waves.
Results. The functional measures worsened with age (p < .001). The syndromes were more prevalent with age except
"all fractures" (p value range < .001­.03). Functional measures were worse among females than males except chair
stand performance and the accelerometry-assessed (in)activity measures (p value range < .001­.01). The syndromes
were more common among females than males except Wave 2 falls and Wave 2 hip fractures (p value range < .001­.03).
Changes from Wave 1 to 2 revealed 11.5%­25.2% of individuals reported better health and 21.3%­44.7% reported
worse health.
Discussion. The NSHAP provides a comprehensive assessment of geriatric health. Our findings are consistent with
the literature and support the construct of the study measures.
Key Words:
Accelerometry--Falls--Fracture--Frailty--Functional assessment--Gait--Older adults--Physical
activity.
Evaluating functional status and geriatric syn-
dromes are critical to the health assessment of older
adults and are often used to help predict their subsequent
health outcomes. Both subjective and objective evalua-
tions of geriatric functional measures (GFM) and geriat-
ric syndromes (GS) exist. These measures may be used
individually or collectively in indices. Older adults con-
stitute a rapidly growing and increasingly heterogeneous
population (Engelman, Canudas-Romo, & Agree, 2010),
and accurate assessments of their functional status and the
presence of geriatric syndromes are essential for efficient
delivery of high-quality and cost-effective care. The utility
and application of prognostic tests has, therefore, become
a central issue in efforts to individualize and optimize
medical care.
To inform these efforts, this paper describes several
key functional and geriatric syndrome measures col-
lected in Wave 1 (W1) and Wave 2 (W2) of the National
Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP). The
GFM collected in W1 and/or W2 of the NSHAP data
set include disability in activities of daily living (ADL)
or instrumental ADL (IADL), timed up and go (TUG),
timed walk (TW), timed chair stands (TCS), and both
self-report and accelerometry-measured physical activity
(Figure 1). The GS measured in W1 and W2 of NSHAP
includes a history of falls, prior fracture, incontinence,
depression, cognitive impairment, and pain (Figure 1).
We also propose a frailty scale based on Fried's frailty
phenotype utilizing NSHAP's available measures for use
in W2. For each GFM and GS, excluding incontinence,
depression, cognitive impairment, and pain which are
presented in other papers in this issue (citation to fol-
low), we describe the data collection and preliminary
findings of the NSHAP by age and gender subgroups. We
also report the change in these measures between W1 and
W2 for the sample included in both waves. We conclude
by reviewing some considerations for data use in future
studies.

Method
NSHAP W1 and W2 Overview
NSHAP was designed to evaluate the health and well-
being of older adults within the context of their romantic
partners and social context. The NSHAP data set includes
survey and biomeasure data collected from a nationally
representative sample of community-dwelling older adults.
Baseline data (W1) were collected in 2005­2006 (Waite,
L. J., Laumann, E. O., Levinson, W., Lindau, S. T., &
O'Muircheartaigh, C. A. National Social Life, Health, and
Aging Project (NSHAP): Wave 1. ICPSR20541-v6. Ann
arbor, MI: Inter-university Consortium for Political and
Social Research [distributor], April 30, 2014. doi:10.3886/
ICPSR20541.v6); 5-year follow-up data (W2) were collected
in 2010­2011 (Waite, L. J., Cagney, K., Dale, W., Huang,
E., Laumann, E. O., McClintock, M., O'Muircheartaigh, C.
A., Schumm, L. P., and Cornwell, B. National Social Life,
Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP): Wave 2 and Partner
Data Collection. ICPSR34921-v1. Ann Arbor, MI: Inter-
university Consortium for Political and Social Research [dis-
tributor], April 29, 2014. doi:10.3886/ICPSR34921.v1). All
assessments were conducted in the home by trained NORC
interviewers. In W1, 3,005 adults between the ages of 57 and
85 were interviewed. These W1 respondents were reinter-
viewed between 2010 and 2011 with their coresident spouses
or partners in addition to newly recruited respondents and
partners, for a total of 3,377 completed interviews; however,
only a subset of partners were considered "age-eligible" and
fell between the ages of 62 and 91 (O'Muirchaigtaigh et al.,
this issue). Excluding age-ineligible respondents, the total
W2 sample was 3,196. Of the total age-eligible sample inter-
viewed in W1 and W2, 2,261 individuals were included in
both W1 and W2 assessments. Respondents were selected
using a multistage area probability design, with oversam-
pling among men and minorities. The detailed sampling
design, respondent recruitment, and study methods have
been reported elsewhere (O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman, &
Smith, 2009).
W1 and W2 Evaluations
The W1 data collection contained two main parts: (a) the
1.5-hr in-person computer-assisted interview (CAPI) with a
core biomeasure assessment, and (b) a leave-behind ques-
tionnaire (LBQ), a paper-and-pencil questionnaire com-
pleted by the respondent on their own time. In addition to
these key portions, there were six substudies containing
various combinations of additional questions and additional
biomeasures. W1 respondents were randomly assigned a pri-
ori to complete one of six evaluation pathways which deter-
mined: (a) which additional questions and biomeasures were
to be administered and (b) whether the additional questions
were to be given in the CAPI or in the LBQ. These pathways
have been previously described (Smith et al., 2009).
In W2, all respondents were also administered a CAPI
with a core biomeasure assessment and LBQ. W2 had three
additional biomeasure substudies which were administered
in a subset of respondents following random assignment to
an interview path (Jaszczak et al., this issue). In addition, a
randomized subset of the W2 sample (n = 738) participated
in an Actigraph Study which included the accelerometry
protocol and a separate self-report sleep activity log. W2
pathways are described in detail elsewhere in this journal
issue (Jaszczak et al., this issue).
Functional Assessment
ADL and IADL.--Difficulty with ADL and IADL were
assessed by self-report in W1 and W2 in the CAPI portion
of the interview. All W1 and W2 participants were asked to
report degree of difficulty completing the following ADL
activities: (a) walking one block, (b) walking across a room,
(c) dressing, including putting on shoes and socks, (d) bath-
ing or showering, (e) eating, such as cutting up food, (f)
getting in or out of bed, and (g) using the toilet, includ-
ing getting up and down. All W1 participants were asked to
report degree of difficulty completing the following IADL
activities: (a) driving a car during the day and (b) driving a
car during the night. Only W2 participants were asked to
report degree of difficulty completing the IADL activities:
(a) preparing meals, (b) taking medications, (c) managing
money such as writing checks and keeping track of bills,
(d) shopping for groceries, (e) performing light housework
such as dishes, light vacuuming, or dusting, (f) using a tel-
ephone, (g) driving a car during the day, and (h) driving
a car during the night. Answer options for all ADL/IADL
questions in both waves included (a) no difficulty, (b) some
difficulty, (c) much difficulty, or (d) unable to do. In W2,
interviewers also recorded whether the respondent stated
they have never previously done the IADL.

GERIATRIC SYNDROMES AND FUNCTIONAL STATUS IN NSHAP
For the current analysis, we created anADL scale for both
W1 and W2 and an IADL scale for W2 to measure func-
tional ability. To create the scales, we assigned one point for
each activity that was reportedly done without difficulty. We
summed the points for each activity to give a total score. For
theADL scale, we included the following activities: walking
a block, walking across the room, dressing, bathing, eating,
transferring in and out of bed, and toileting. For the IADL
scale, we included meal preparation, money management,
shopping, light housework, medication administration, tel-
ephone use, driving during the day, and driving during the
night. The ADL scales ranged from 0­7, a score of 7 indi-
cating the best function. The IADL scale ranged from 0­8,
a score of 8 indicating the best function. (Researchers may
consider an alternative scale that consolidates the two walk-
ing ADL functions. For example, respondents able to "walk
a block" should be able to "walk across a room" and could
be assigned only 1 point; respondents only able to "walk
across a room" could be assigned 0.5 point.)
Timed up and go.--In W1 only, approximately half of
the respondents (N = 1,506) were randomly assigned to
complete a 3-m TUG test (Podsiadlo & Richardson, 1991)
((Respondents who were wheelchair bound or were unsafe to
complete the gait or chair stands exercise were also identified
as "unable to do" and considered the group with the poorest
functional status for that measure.). Using a chair from the
home setting and a 3-m length of string placed on the floor
starting at the chair legs and extending directly outward, the
interviewer first demonstrated the activity and then asked the
respondent to complete the task. Respondents were allowed
to use walking assistive devices and were recommended to
walk at a "comfortable and safe" pace. Time was recorded
at the end of three intervals during the TUG test: (a) start-
ing with respondent seated in the chair and ending when the
respondent reached the end of the 3-m string, (b) starting
with the respondent turn and ending when the respondent
reached the chair, (c) starting with the respondent initiation
of sit movement and ending with respondent fully seated.
The total time to complete this test was calculated by sum-
ming the three intervals. Interviewers recorded any observed
gait abnormalities (Gait abnormalities noted include: walked
unsteadily; limped, shuffled or dragged a leg; had an unsteady
turn; used a cane or walker; or stated the walk was painful).
The TUG test was scored using previously published guide-
lines (Podsiadlo & Richardson, 1991). Respondents complet-
ing the task in 10 or fewer seconds were considered to have
a "normal" performance; respondents requiring 11­20 s to
complete the task were considered to have a "delayed" per-
formance; respondents requiring more than 20 s to complete
the task were considered to have an "impaired" performance.
Gait speed.--In W2 only, respondents completed a 3-m
TW which was completed two times (Respondents who
were wheelchair bound or were unsafe to complete the gait
or chair stands exercise were also identified as "unable to do"
and considered the group with the poorest functional status
for that measure). The TW exercise was derived from the
Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) (Guralnik et al.,
1994). The interviewer first demonstrated the exercise for
the respondent. The respondents were asked to stand at the
beginning of a 3-m piece of string. When given a cue, they
walked the length of the string at their "usual pace." Walking
devices such as a cane or walker were allowed during the
task. Interviewers recorded the total time required to com-
plete each walk. Exercise limitations were identified when
present (Exercise limitations noted included: there was an
equipment problem; the respondent tried but was unable to
complete the task; the respondent could not walk unassisted;
the walk was not attempted due to respondent or interviewer
safety concerns; the respondent could not understand the
instructions; or other reasons prevented completion of task).
Interviewers also noted any observed gait abnormalities as
described above. Scoring of the fastest TW was based on the
gait speed score for the SPPB, which originally applied to a
4-m walk (Guralnik et al., 1994) but scoring was later pro-
vided for an 8-foot walk (Guralnik et al., 2000): 1 point if the
time to walk 3 m was 5.7 s, 2 points if 4.1­5.6 s, 3 points
if 3.2­4.0 s, and 4 points if 3.1 ss (Guralnik et al., 1994).
Chair stands.--TCS were measured in W2 only
(Respondents who were wheelchair bound or were unsafe to
complete the gait or chair stands exercise were also identified
as "unable to do" and considered the group with the poor-
est functional status for that measure). The TCS exercise was
adapted from the SPPB (Guralnik et al., 1994). Respondents
were first asked to complete a single chair stand using a chair
in the home setting without the use of their arms. The inter-
viewer first demonstrated the activity: feet were planted firmly
on the ground leaving approximately one hand's width of
space between the knee and the chair, arms were folded across
the chest, and the person attempted to stand keeping the arms
folded. At the end of the task, interviewers noted any exer-
cise limitations as described above. If the single chair stand
was successful, the respondent was asked to perform the TCS
exercise, five serial chair stands, as quickly as possible. The
time was recorded after the respondent completely stood up
on the fifth stand. Exercise limitations were again identified
as previously described. Scoring of the TCS was based on the
original TCS score from the SPPB: 1 point if time to complete
the exercise was 16.7 s, 2 points if the time was between 13.7
and 16.6 s, 3 points if time was between 11.2 and 13.6 s, and 4
points if time was 11.1 s (Guralnik et al., 1994).
Physical Activity
NSHAP measured physical activity in two ways: (a)
self-report in both waves and (b) accelerometry in Wave
2. Accelerometers have been applied extensively in clini-
cal and research settings to objectively measure physical
S179
Megan Huisingh-Scheetz ET AL.
activity (Cheung, Gray, & Karunanithi, 2011; Kowalski,
Rhodes, Naylor, Tuokko, & Macdonald, 2012; Prince et al.,
2008). NSHAP used Actiwatch Spectrum accelerometers to
evaluate physical activity objectively in a subset of W2 study
respondents.
Physical activity measurement: self-report.--In W1, all
respondents were asked a single question about their exercise
habits: "How often do you participate in physical activity such
as walking, dancing, gardening, physical exercise, or sports?"
Response options included: (a) 3 or more times per week, (b)
1­2 times per week, (c) 1­3 times per month, (d) less than 1
time per month, (e) never, (f) don't know, or (g) refused.
In W2, self-reported physical activity was assessed using
four questions. All respondents were asked to report their
participation in vigorous physical activity with the follow-
ing question: "On average over the last 12 months, how
often have you participated in vigorous physical activity or
exercise? By vigorous physical activity, we mean 30 MIN
OR MORE of things like sports, exercise classes, heavy
housework, or a job that involves physical labor." Answer
choices included (a) 5 or more times per week, (b) 3 or 4
times per week, (c) 1­2 times per week, (d) 1­3 times per
month, (e) less than 1 time per month, or (f) never. In the
current analysis, respondents reporting "3 or 4 activities per
week" or "5 or more activities per week" were combined
into a single category to be able to compare it to W1 data.
Additionally in W2, respondents in the Actigraph Study
(n = 793 total; n = 738 age eligible) were given a take-home
sleep activity log. Respondents were asked about the frequency
of their involvement in three intensities of activity. First, "How
often do you take part in sports or activities that are vigorous,
such as running or jogging, swimming, cycling, aerobics or
gym workout, tennis, or digging with a spade or shovel?"
Second, "How often do you take part in sports or activities
that are moderately energetic, such as gardening, cleaning the
car, walking at a moderate pace, dancing, or floor or stretching
exercises?" Third, " How often do you take part in sports or
activities that are mildly energetic, such as vacuuming, laun-
dry, or home repairs?"Answer options were the same for each
question: (a) more than once a week, (b) once a week, (c) one
to three times a month, and (d) hardly ever or never.
Physical activity measurement: actigraphy.--A random
sample (n = 738) of the W2 respondents was included
in the Actigraph Study. The Actiwatch Spectrum model
(Actiwatch Spectrum; Philips Respironics, Andover, MA),
a uniaxial, omnidirectional, piezo-electric, waterproof
accelerometer worn on the wrist (Respironics, 2013), was
used in the NSHAP Actigraph Study to objectively measure
sleep and physical activity patterns. It continuously collects
acceleration/deceleration data at a rate of 32 Hz; the move-
ments are then averaged in real time over 15-s intervals
called "epochs" and recorded as an activity "count." If no
activity occurs during the epoch, such as during sleep or
rest, 0 is recorded for that activity count. There are 5,760
activity counts recorded per day. The Actiwatch Spectrum
is optimized to collect movement in the 0.35­7.5 Hz range.
To help distinguish sleep and awake intervals, theActiwatch
Spectrum model also records ambient light exposure and
wearers can record when they go to bed and when they
awaken. The Actiwatch Spectrum is 48×37×14mm in
size and weighs 30g. Data stored in the accelerometer can
be downloaded and analyzed using the Actiware software
available from the manufacturer (Respironics, 2013). Once
the data are downloaded, rest and wake intervals can be
identified using manufacturer-suggested guidelines, cues
from respondent recordings, and the light data (Lauderdale
et al., this issue). Several commonly used accelerometer
measurements, including the rest and wake intervals, are
also available in the public NSHAP W2 data set.
Respondents were given instructions during the interview
on use of the accelerometer monitors. Then, a copy of the
instructions was mailed with the monitors to the participating
respondents. Respondents were asked to place the monitors
on their nondominant wrist and to wear the monitors for 72hr
(notremovedduringwateractivitieslikebathing.)Sleepactiv-
ity booklets were also provided and respondents were asked
to record daily events including date, time arising, number of
minutes napped, and time to bed. Respondents also pushed
a button on the monitors to indicate when they went to bed
and when they got up from bed. After confirming the mailing
address, interviewers called respondents to arrange a time of
package delivery.After use, the monitors were returned to the
project in a prepaid mailing box. When the accelerometers
were returned, the data were downloaded using the Actiware
software. Preliminary findings are reported for the follow-
ing measures: mean count over the total wear time, peak
count during total wear time, and percent of day spent at rest
(count = 0). For each gender/age subgroup, we presented the
95th, 75th, 50th, 25th, and 5th percentile values.
Geriatric Syndromes
Falls.--Respondents' falls history was collected via
self-report in both W1 and W2 of NSHAP. In W1, respond-
ents were first asked whether they had fallen in the past
12 months. If the respondents answered "yes," they were
then asked, "How many times have you fallen in the past
12 months?" Responses were recorded as integers. In W2,
all respondents were asked if they had fallen 0, 1, or 2 or
more times in the last year in the LBQ. For this analysis, we
separately reported the percent of participants in W1 and
W2 who reported falling once in the past year and the per-
cent who reported two or more times in the last year.
Fracture.--History of fracture was assessed by self-
report in W1 and W2. In W1, respondents were asked in
their interview whether they had a fracture or broken a bone
S180
GERIATRIC SYNDROMES AND FUNCTIONAL STATUS IN NSHAP
after the age of 45. For those answering "yes," a follow-
up question asked respondents to identify which bone
was broken (hip, leg, wrist, vertebrae/backbone, or other).
If respondents reported "other" bone, they were asked to
specify. In W2, an interviewer asked all respondents if a
doctor had ever told them they had a hip fracture. In the
LBQ, respondents were also asked whether they have had
a fracture or broken bone in the past 5 years (e.g., since the
W1 survey). Those who responded yes were asked to iden-
tify which bone was fractured (hip, leg, wrist, vertebrae/
backbone, nose, skull, or other). If respondents reported
"other" bone, they were asked to specify. In this analysis,
we reported results for the LBQ question.
Frailty.--Frailty measurement. Several proposed mod-
els for measuring frailty exist including the accumulated
deficits index first proposed by Rockwood et al. (Mitnitski,
Mogilner, & Rockwood, 2001), a set of phenotypic crite-
ria proposed by Fried and colleagues (2001), and a physi-
cian index proposed by Studenski and colleagues (2004).
Several frailty measurements could be constructed using
the NSHAP data set. As an example, we proposed adapted
frailty phenotypic criteria in W2 based on the original
five criteria: (a) unintentional weight loss, (b) weak grip
strength, (c) slow gait speed, (d) presence of exhaustion,
and (e) low physical activity (Fried et al., 2001).
All five of the criteria were either directly measured
or a surrogate measure was available in the subset of W2
respondents included in both waves. Presence of exhaus-
tion was determined using two modified Center for
Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale ques-
tions (Radloff, 1977). Respondents were asked how often
over the last week they felt that everything was an effort and
how often they felt that they could not get going. Answer
options for both questions included: (a) rarely or none of
the time, (b) some of the time, (c) occasionally, or (d) most
of the time. A point for exhaustion was assigned to respond-
ents who answered "occasionally" or "most of the time" to
either of these questions. Gait speed was measured directly.
A point for slow gait speed was given to individuals requir-
ing 5.7 s to complete the TW and to individuals who were
wheelchair bound or could not complete the exercise safely.
Physical activity was assessed using a single self-reported
question described above in W2. Respondents were given a
point for low physical activity if they reported participating
in physical activity "1­3 times per month," "less than 1 time
per month," or "never." TCS was used as a surrogate meas-
ure for grip strength. Respondents were assigned a point for
weakness if they required 16.7 s to complete the exercise
or were wheelchair bound or could not complete the task
safely. Weight loss was calculated by determining the dif-
ference in measured weight between W1 and W2 for each
respondent. A weight loss point was assigned to individuals
losing 10% of their weight or more. A frailty score, ranging
0­5, was created by summing the points for each criteria.
A similar but abbreviated frailty scale could be constructed
in W1 using self-reported exhaustion, TUG performance in
place of gait and chair stands, and self-reported physical
activity participation; weight loss was not measured in W1.
Change Over Time
Several GFM and GS measures were available in both
waves allowing comparison of trend over time: self-reported
physical activity, gait/chair stand evaluation, ADL func-
tion, and falls. For these measures, we reported the follow-
ing changes over time: (a) proportion of respondents who
improved, (b) proportion of respondents who stayed the
same, and (c) the proportion of respondents who declined
over 5 years. In addition, the 5-year incidence was also cal-
culated for the following measures: those reporting 3 vig-
orous activities per month, those declining to the slowest
25th percentile of the sample for gait and chair stand perfor-
mance, those reporting dependence in at least oneADL, and
those reporting two or more falls in the prior year.
Since gait and chair stand function were evaluated
together using the TUG in W1 and separately in W2 using
the TW and TCS, we summed the fastest walk time from
the TW and the time to complete the TCS. Comparing the
W1 TUG measure to the combined W2 measure yielded
the best correlation factor of all attempted combinations of
the variables: 0.29 (Figure 2). To indentify the proportion
of the sample who performed better, worse, or stayed the
same on their walk and chair stand performance, we calcu-
lated the change in quantile among respondents with non-
missing values for both measures. To report the incidence
of the poorest performers, we identified the proportion of
respondents whose time to complete the exercises dropped
into the lowest 25th percentile in W2

Statistical Analysis
Version 2.1 of the NSHAP data set was used for all analy-
ses. Sample design weights were used in the analyses to
account for the complex survey design and to obtain point
estimates and standard errors that reflect the national popula-
tion composition. Proportions, means, or medians were esti-
mated for each functional measure and geriatric syndrome
stratified by age/gender subgroups using the age-eligible
respondents in W1 and W2. Standard errors are presented for
all values. The significance of age and gender was assessed
using linear (log TUG, log gait speed, log chair stands, mean
activity count, peak activity count, percent time spent at rest)
and logistic regression (physical activity: 0­2 vs. 3­4; ADL:
0­6 vs. 7; IADL: 0­7 vs. 8; falls ­ 0­1 vs. 2+; all fractures:
no vs. yes; hip fractures: no vs. yes; osteoporotic fractures: no
vs. yes; frailty: 0­2 vs. 3+) as appropriate for each functional
measure and geriatric syndrome, though only p values for t
tests are reported in the text. Stata 13 (StataCorp, 2011) was
used for all analyses except to calculate medians and quan-
tiles. TUG, TW, and TCS medians and quantile summaries of
actigraphy data were obtained using the R 2.15 (R Core) (R
Development Core Team, 2012) svyquantile function avail-
able in the "survey" package (Lumley, 2004, 2012).
Results
Functional Assessment
ADLs and IADLs.--Using the ADL scale in W1, mean
ADL functional ability was 6.2 (SE = 0.04) for the total sam-
ple. ADL function significantly declined with age (p < .001)
and was worse among females (p < .001). Therefore, the
oldest age groups had the worst ADL function (men = 5.9,
SE = 0.2; women = 5.7, SE = 0.1). Using the ADL scale in
W2, mean ADL functional ability was 6.2 (SE = 0.05) for
the total sample. Difficulty with ADL functions was more
common with advancing age (p < .001) and among females
(p = .001). The oldest age groups has the worst ADL func-
tion (men = 5.7, SE = 0.1; women = 5.7, SE = 0.1). Using
the W2 IADL scale, mean IADL functional ability was 7.0
(SE = 0.6) for the total sample. Difficulty with IADL func-
tions was also more common with advancing age (p < .001)
and among females (p < .001). The oldest groups had the
worst IADL function (men = 6.6, SE = 0.2; women = 6.0,
SE = 0.2).
TUG.--In the W1, 1,506 respondents were randomized
to complete the TUG test (Table 1). The median time to
complete the TUG for the entire sample was 10.8 s (range
3­118 s). TUG performance was significantly slower
among women than among men (p = .003) and worsened
with age (p < .001). Of the total sample, 7.1% (SE = 1) took
greater than 20 s to complete the exercise, whereas 41.3%
(SE = 2) completed the exercise within 10 s, the fastest per-
formance category.
Gait speed.--All of the age-eligible respondents in W2
were asked to complete two, 3-m TWs (n = 3,196). One
walk time was recorded as 0 s. Since 0 s is not physi-
ologically possible, this value was recoded as missing.
Excluding this respondent, the median gait speed for the
total sample was 4.1 s (range 2­60 s). Gait speed sig-
nificantly declined with age (p < .001) and was generally
slower among women (p = .01). Of the faster of the two
walks, approximately 29.6% (SE = 1.5) of the age-eligible
sample took 5.7 s or longer to walk 3 m, whereas 16.2%
(SE = 1.2) were able to walk the same distance in less than
or equal to 3.1 s.
Chair stands.--All of the W2 age-eligible respondents
were asked to complete the TCS (n = 3,196). One TCS
time was recorded as 1 s. Since 1 s is not physiologi-
cally possible, this value was recoded as missing. The
median time to complete the five repeated chair stands
was 12.6 s (range 1­76 s). Time to complete the TCS
significantly increased with age (p < .001) and was gen-
erally higher among women though this was not a sig-
nificant trend (p = .09). In this sample, 20% (SE = 1.4)
took 16.7 s or longer to complete the exercise, whereas
29.1% (SE = 1.6) completed the exercise in  11.1 s, the
fastest category.
Physical activity.--In W1, 62.7% (SE = 1) of respond-
ents reported participating in physical activity three
or more times per week, a percentage thought to be
much higher than actual physical activity participation.
Frequency of reported physical activity declined with age
(p = .02) and was lower among females (p < .001). Of the
3,196 age-eligible respondents in W2, 41.9% (SE = 1.3)
reported participating in vigorous activities three or more
times per week. Frequency of reported physical activity
declined with age (p < .001) and was lower among females
(p < .001). The variation in reported activities between W1
and W2 is likely due, in part, to differences in question
wording.
Actigraphy data was collected in 793 W2 respondents;
only 738 of them were age-eligible (Table 3). The mean
activity count and the peak activity count significantly
declined with age (p < .001 for both), while percentage of
time spent at rest increased with age (p = .005). The mean
activity count was significantly higher among females than
males (p < .001); peak activity count and percentage of
time spent at rest did not vary by gender (peak activity
count p = .59, percentage time spent at rest p = .26). The
5th percentile of the mean activity count for this sample
was 16.3 counts (SE = 0.7); the 95th percentile of the mean
activity count was 63.0 counts per day (SE = 2.4). The
median percent of time spent at rest was 50.2% (SE = 0.9),
but this measure varied widely: its 5th percentile was 38%
of the day (SE = 0.9), while its 95th percentile was 65.2%
of the day (SE = 0.7).

Geriatric Syndromes
Falls.--In W1, 9.4% (SE = 0.6) and 11.5% (SE = 0.8)
of the respondents had experienced one and two or more
falls, respectively, in the previous year (Table 1). In W2,
17.4% (SE = 0.8) and 12.1% (SE = 0.8) of respondents
reported having experienced one and two or more falls,
respectively, in the previous year (Table 2). Reporting
two or more falls was significantly more common with
advancing age (W1 p = .002, W2 p < .001) and among
females in W1 (W1 p = .002, W2 p = .06) such that the
oldest women were the most likely to have reported two or
more falls in both W1 and W2 (W1: 14.7%, SE = 2; W2:
16.7%, SE = 2.1).
Fractures.--Prevalence of all fractures after the age
of 45 was 23.1% (SE = 0.9) in the entire W1 group; it
was higher among females than males (p < .001) in all
age groups and increased with age (p < .001) (Table 1).
Frequency of reported osteoporotic fractures (hip, verte-
bral, wrist) was 5.9% (SE = 0.6). Overall prevalence of
hip fracture since age 45 in W1 was 1.2% (SE = 0.3). In
W2, prevalence of all fractures in the prior 5 years in the
total sample was 12.7% (SE = 1) (Table 2). Prevalence
was significantly higher among women than men
(p < .001) and was highest among the 70­79 year olds
for both gender groups (women: 19.7%, SE = 2.7; men:
10.9%, SE = 2.1) rather than in the oldest age category
(trend with age p = .08), a finding perhaps related to
fracture-related institutionalization. In the 5-year interval
between W1 and W2, 3.9% (SE = 0.6) of W2 respondents
reported having an osteoporotic fracture. In W2, 1.1%
(SE = 0.2) reported having a hip fracture since W1. Both
hip and osteoporotic fractures were significantly more
common with advancing age (hip p < .001, osteoporotic
p = .03). Osteoporotic fractures but not hip fractures were
significantly more common among females (hip p = .34,
osteoporotic p = .03).
Frailty.--All five frailty criteria were calculated in the
subsample of W2 respondents who were also included in
W1 (n = 2,261) (Table 4). In this group, 11.5% (SE = 1.1)
were categorized as having significant weight loss, 29.1%
(SE = 1.5) were categorized as having slow gait speed, 28.6
(SE = 1.9) of the W2 respondents were categorized as hav-
ing slow chair stands, 23.5% (SE = 1.4) were categorized as
having exhaustion, and 38.4% (SE = 1.7) were categorized
as having low physical activity. Combining these findings
into a 5-point frailty scale for W2 respondents classified
1.7% (SE = 0.5), 5.8% (SE = 0.6), and 11.4% (SE = 1.0)
as frail (5, 4, and 3 points, respectively); 19.0% (SE = 1.2)
and 29.7% (SE = 1.1) as pre-frail (2 and 1 points, respec-
tively); and 33% (SE = 1.8) as nonfrail (0 points). Frail sta-
tus was significantly associated with older age (p < .001)
and female gender (p < .001).
Functional Change Between Wave 1 and Wave 2
Change in the GFM and GS measures were compared
among the common.--W1/W2 study sample. Those who
were included in W1 but not W2 were significantly differ-
ent from those who were included in both waves (Table 5).
While the common sample was slightly older (Age: W1
only = 71.2, W1-2 = 72.2, p value = .03), they were more
educated (<High school education: W1 only = 28.0%,
W1-2 = 15.8%, p value <.001) and had overall better func-
tion than the sample included only in Wave 1. They reported
more physical activity (3+ activities/week:W1 only = 51.7%,
W1-2 = 65.9%, p value <.001), had a higher level of ADL
independence (ADL score: W1 only = 5.6, W1-2 = 6.3, p
value <.001), fewer had two or more falls in the prior year
(2 falls: W1 only = 19.4%, W1-2 = 9.5%, p value <.001),
and fewer had impaired gait on the TUG at baseline (20 s:
W1 only = 15.1%, W1-2 = 4.9%, p value <.001).
Comparing the change in GFM and GS measures among
the common W1/W2 study sample revealed that 44.7%
(SE = 1.2) of the respondents reported less physical activ-
ity, the gait and chair stand performance rank dropped by
10 percentiles or more in 44.7% (SE = 1.5) of the sample,
21.3% (SE = 1.1) had fewer independent activities, and
22.7% (SE = 1.1) reported more falls at W2 (Table 6). In
contrast, 11.5% (SE = 0.8) reported more physical activ-
ity, the gait and chair stand performance rank improved by
10 percentiles or more in 25.2% (SE = 1.5) of the sample,
14% (SE = 0.8) reported more independent activities, and
11.6% (SE = 0.9) reported fewer falls in W2. Five-year inci-
dence of low physical activity was 28.6% (SE = 1.1), of
those declining to the slowest 25th percentile of gait and
chair stand performance was 17.2% (SE = 1.6), of loss of
complete independence was 13.6% (SE = 0.9), and of two
or more falls in the prior year was 9.2% (SE = 0.9).
Discussion
The NSHAP data set provides rich subjective and objec-
tive functional data in a large, nationally representative
sample of community-dwelling older adults. The con-
sistent application of objective functional measures like
TCS, TW, and accelerometry across several studies (e.g.,
Study of Osteoporotic Fractures; Health, Aging, and Body
Composition; Minority Aging Project) allows for compari-
son between the NSHAP cohort and other large, American
cohorts. NSHAP's baseline and 5-year follow-up data fur-
thermore allow the evaluation of functional status trends
over time. Below we highlight several ways in which the
NSHAP data could be used in future research and note
issues that researchers should consider when using the data.
The NSHAP GFM and GS are appropriate for use as
either primary outcome variables or covariates. For exam-
ple, two or more falls could be used as an outcome in studies
investigating fall risk factors. In contrast, studies compar-
ing the size of social networks among subgroups might

consider the effect of a prior fall on socialization. Declines
in functional status can be considered both a consequence
of disease and an indicator of disease burden, depending
on the study. Slow gait speed, for example, may occur as a
result of worsening heart failure (an outcome of the disease)
and can also help identify people with more severe stages
of heart failure (disease burden). The NSHAP functional
measures allow for these important comparisons in older
adult health studies.
Self-reported measures have been used widely among
nationally representative datasets given its relative brev-
ity and ease of administration (e.g., National Health and
Nutrition Evaluation Survey, Health and Retirement Study).

impairment--there is concern regarding accuracy of self-
reported data (Kuczmarski, Kuczmarski, & Najjar, 2001;
van Uffelen, Heesch, Hill, & Brown, 2011; Yong & Saito,
2012). While NSHAP excluded people with a history of
dementia, it is not uncommon for early cognitive impair-
ment to go undiagnosed in the community (Bradford,
Kunik, Schulz, Williams, & Singh, 2009) and, indeed, vary-
ing levels of cognitive functioning were identified in this
population (Kotwal et al., this issue). NSHAP uniquely
offers several objective measures in this national data set
providing for numerous opportunities to evaluate subjective
versus objective survey measurements.
Actigraphy-measured physical activity is a distinctive
feature of the NSHAP data set; however, several points
should be considered when using the actigraphy data. The
Actiwatch Spectrum is one of several Actiwatch models

(Actiwatch 64, Actiwatch 2, Actiwatch Spectrum) manu-
factured by Philips Respironics (Respironics, 2013). Each
Actiwatch model has unique features; the Actiwatch 2 and
Actiwatch Spectrum have a more durable accelerometer
than the Actiwatch 64. Data output between these models,
however, is highly correlated ("Equivalence of Activity
Recordings and Derived Sleep Statistics: Actiwatch-64,
Actiwatch-2, and Actiwatch Spectrum," 2008). Older
Actiwatch models have been used to validate the acceler-
ometer against indirect calorimetry (Chen et al., 2003; Van
Remoortel et al., 2012). The output (activity counts) from
the Actiwatch models are moderately correlated (r = .53)
with minute-to-minute metabolic equivalents (kcal/kg
× hr) measured by indirect calorimetry in older, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease adults performing a set of
lab-based exercises mimicking typical day-to-day activities
(Van Remoortel et al., 2012). Activity counts are also sig-
nificantly correlated (0.65±0.09) with indirect calorimeter-
measured energy expenditure in kilocalories among young
to middle-aged, healthy but sedentary women (Chen et al.,
2003). The value of individual activity counts can, there-
fore, be used to help identify periods of higher or lower
intensity activity or inactivity.
A few Actiwatch Spectrum limitations are also worth
noting. The Actiwatch is worn on the wrist and does not
readily detect (a) the increase of intensity when activities
are performed on an incline or (b) acceleration when activi-
ties are performed on stationary units (i.e., ergometers). For
the NSHAP data set, activities such as stair-climbing or
stationary bicycle use may be underrepresented. Previous
researchers have published an equation to predict kilocalo-
rie energy expenditure from the Actiwatch activity counts
(Chen et al., 2003). Predicted energy expenditure is only
modestly correlated with measured energy expenditure and
typically underestimates measured kilocalories, particularly
at higher intensity activity (Chen et al., 2003).
Frailty, defined as a state of increased vulnerability and
loss of ability to maintain homeostasis (Rockwood, Fox,
Stolee, Robertson, & Beattie, 1994), is an important clini-
cal concept carrying significant prognostic weight, predict-
ing subsequent disability, falls, and mortality. A number of
indexes of frailty for older adults have been suggested, each
with advantages and disadvantages. While we proposed
adapted frailty phenotype criteria, other frailty measures
could easily be constructed using the NSHAP data set and
studied (Fried et al., 2001; Mitnitski et al., 2001).
The modifications to the frailty phenotype criteria raise
several notable considerations. Respondents may be more
likely to meet the frailty criteria for exhaustion using the
NSHAP alterations to the wording in the CES-D ("occa-
sionally" replaced "occasionally or a moderate amount of
time."). In the Cardiovascular Health Study, Fried and col-
leagues (2001) noted that 17% of the total sample had self-
reported exhaustion, while the NSHAP study found 24.9%
in W1 and 24.3% in W2. In addition, depressed respondents
may be classified as prefrail using the proposed frailty scale
based on exhaustion as a symptom of their depression rather
than a symptom of their physical decline.
The TW is not adjusted for height or gender like the
original 15-foot walk in the frailty phenotype (Fried et al.,
2001). Not accounting for these factors could conceivably
overestimate the presence of slow gait speed among those
with short stature or among women compared with men. In
addition, the W1 and W2 gait exercises differed. Comparing
gait performance in W1 to W2 may be best done through
change in quantile for each respondent.
Measured weight loss is calculated over the course of
the 5-year follow-up from W1 to W2. While the original
frailty phenotype criteria used 5% or more of unintentional
weight loss over 1 year, extrapolations of this criteria have
been applied over longer intervals (Xue, Bandeen-Roche,
Varadhan, Zhou, & Fried, 2008). We suggest using 10% or
more weight loss as the adapted criteria; however, investi-
gators may have reasons for choosing an alternative cutoff.
NSHAP did not distinguish intentional from unintentional
weight loss and may consequently overestimate frailty, par-
ticularly among the respondents who were actively trying
to lose weight during this time frame. However, given the
sedentary lifestyle of most U.S. adults (Li et al., 2011) as
well as the difficulty sustaining weight loss for 5 years once
achieved through lifestyle modifications (Kraschnewski
et al., 2010), this type of overestimation is probably rare.
Finally, using chair stands as a surrogate for grip strength
may additionally introduce an estimation of balance and
proprioception into what should be strictly a sarcopenia
measure. Since loss of balance and proprioception have also
been shown to correlate with frailty measures, substituting
chair stands for grip strength is reasonable (Deshpande,
Metter, & Ferrucci, 2010; Martínez-Ramírez et al., 2011).
Studying change over time in the function and geriatric
syndrome measures creates a unique opportunity to study,
not only decline in health, but also improvement in health
as we have shown. Of particular importance in our aging
society is studying the social environment predictors of
improvement in health. While we attempt to prevent any
avoidable circumstances that might precipitate functional
loss, some acute events such as hospitalization will inevi-
tably occur among elders. NSHAP can be used to help
study the factors that promote function recovery. It should
be noted that some of the functional measures were simi-
lar but not identical between waves. In particular, W1 used
the TUG while W2 used a separate TW and TCS. Caution
is strongly advised when comparing these measures across
waves. It should also be noted that the sample participants
who dropped out of the study after W1 were less educated
and more functionally impaired at baseline. Studying trends
over time will not reflect this group and should be consid-
ered a limitation in future studies.
In conclusion, functional measures are some of the most
important indicators of health status and tools for prognosis

in older adults. NSHAP provides a rich resource for study-
ing functional status among a nationally-representative
sample of older community-dwelling adults. These impor-
tant clinical measures combined with the detailed data on
social networks, disability, cognitive function, medication
use, mental health, comorbidity, and mortality provide a
key resource for investigating trends in health status among
older adults in the United States.

Key Points
· Functional measures are critical to understanding the
health status of older adults and helping to determine
prognoses.
· The NSHAP data set provides rich functional data in a
large, nationally representative sample of community
dwelling older adults. Measures include timed walk,
repeated chair stands, falls, fracture, and accelerom-
etry. Indicators of frailty status are also available.
· The NSHAP functional measures combined with the
detailed data on social network, disability, cognitive
function, medication use, mental health, comorbid-
ity, and mortality collected at baseline and at 5-year
follow-up.
