ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION
Variation in the Tendency of Primary Care
Physicians to Intervene
Brenda E. Sirovich, MD, MS; Daniel J. Gottlieb, MS; H. Gilbert Welch, MD, MPH; Elliott S. Fisher, MD, MPH
Background: Research has documented dramatic varia-
tion in health care spending across the United States that
has little relationship to health outcomes. Although high-
spending areas have more physicians per capita, it is not
known whether this disparity fully explains the differ-
ences in spending or whether individual physicians in
high-spending regions have a greater tendency to inter-
vene for their patients. We sought to measure the ten-
dency of primary care physicians to intervene across re-
gions that differ in their levels of local health care
spending.
Methods: We used data from the Community Track-
ing Study Physician Survey, a telephone survey of a na-
tionally representative sample of 5490 primary care phy-
sicians who provided care to adults in 1998-1999
(response rate 59%). Local health care spending in phy-
sicians' communities was determined by assigning each
participating physician to 1 of 306 US hospital referral
regions. The tendency of physicians to intervene was mea-
sured by evaluating their responses to 6 clinical vi-
gnettes in which they were asked how often they would
order a test, referral, or treatment for the patient de-
scribed.
Results: In 5 of the 6 vignettes, physicians in high-
spending regions were more likely to recommend inter-
ventions than those practicing in low-spending regions.
For example, for a 35-year-old man with back pain and
foot drop, physicians in high-spending regions would rec-
ommend magnetic resonance imaging 82% of the time,
compared with 69% for physicians in low-spending re-
gions (P.001). For a 60-year-old man somewhat both-
ered by symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, phy-
sicians in high-spending regions would make a urology
referral 32% of the time, while those in low-spending re-
gions would do so only 23% of the time (P.001). Our
findings that physicians in high-spending regions have
a greater tendency to intervene persisted in analyses strati-
fied by physician specialty (family/general practice vs in-
ternal medicine).
Conclusion: Varying rates of health care spending
across the United States reflect the underlying tendency
of local physicians to recommend interventions for their
patients.

THERE IS WIDESPREAD RECOG-
nition that health care
spending varies widely
acrosstheUnitedStates.Per
capita Medicare expendi-
ture in the areas of highest spending is
double that in the lowest-spending areas,
even though in some cases these repre-
sent neighboring areas. Because higher
spending does not appear to result in bet-
ter outcomes or quality of care,1,2 there is
intense interest in understanding the rea-
sons for the wide variation in utilization
of services. Average illness severity var-
ies little across regions1; therefore, atten-
tion has focused increasingly on the role
of physicians who, through their actions
and recommendations, control most health
care resources and thereby direct most
health care spending.
There are, however, competing expla-
nations of how physicians might contrib-
ute to higher health care spending. On the
one hand, high-spending areas have more
physicians per capita,3 and on average, pa-
tients in these areas each see a greater num-
ber of physicians.1 Even if each physi-
cian's shared ordering pattern is identical
to those in lower-spending areas, utiliza-
tion (and spending) per capita would be
higher in areas with a greater number of
physicians. On the other hand, physi-
cians in high- and low-spending regions
may have entirely different ordering pat-
terns. Specifically, physicians in high-
spending areas may be more prone to in-
tervene--to order tests, referrals, and
treatments--for individual patients.
We sought to determine whether phy-
sician behavior is at least in part respon-
sible for widely varying spending and
utilization patterns across the United
States--that is, to what extent individual
physicians in high-spending regions have
a greater tendency to intervene for indi-
vidual patients.

METHODS
OVERVIEW
We used Medicare data to categorize regions of the United States
according to health care spending within the region. We then
used data from a national physician survey to examine the ten-
dency of physicians practicing in regions with different spend-
ing levels to intervene (to order tests, referrals, or treatment)
in specific clinical situations.
STUDY POPULATION
We analyzed data from the second round of the Community
Tracking Study (CTS) Physician Survey, 1998-1999,4 a tele-
phone survey of a nationally representative sample of physi-
cians conducted for the Center for Studying Health System
Change. The survey uses a complex design that includes 60 com-
munity sites and a small, independently drawn national sample.5
Using the master files of the American Medical Association and
the American Osteopathic Association, the CTS sampled ac-
tive nonfederal physicians (n=12 280) in a variety of clinical
specialties who spent at least 20 hours per week in direct pa-
tient care. Physicians in training were excluded.
Because the present study focuses on clinical decisions en-
countered in adult primary care, we included only primary care
physicians (identified by the CTS specialty designations family/
general practice and internal medicine) who care for adult pa-
tients (n=5490). All physicians were surveyed by telephone be-
tween August 1998 and November 1999 in interviews that
averaged 21 minutes. The overall response rate was 61%; the
response rate among all primary care physicians was 59%. Ad-
ditional information on the CTS Physician Survey can be found
elsewhere.6,7
MEASURES
Exposure: Local Spending
We used as our measure of local spending the End-of-Life Ex-
penditure Index (EOL-EI),1,2 a previously derived measure based
on health care expenditures in the last 6 months of life. The
EOL-EI is calculated as age-, sex-, and race-adjusted spending
(measured with standardized national prices) on hospital and
physician services provided to Medicare enrollees in their last
6 months of life. We elected to use EOL-EI to compare spend-
ing across different regions of the United States because it is
very closely related to overall spending1,2 but unrelated to ill-
ness (every patient included in the measure had the same life
expectancy of exactly 6 months). In previous work, members
of our research team have shown that the greater than 2-fold
differences that exist across US regions in the intensity of care
at the end of life are highly predictive of differences in overall
spending but unrelated to differences in patient preferences at
the end of life8 or illness level.1,9
We calculated the mean EOL-EI for each of 306 US hospi-
tal referral regions (HRRs) from mid-1994 to 1997; HRRs were
then sorted in order of increasing EOL-EI and divided into quin-
tiles of approximately equal population size based on the en-
tire Medicare population aged 65 or older. Mean EOL-EI (cal-
culated for each quintile by weighting each HRR according to
its Medicare population) ranged from $9074 in the lowest quin-
tile to $14 644 in the highest quintile. Based on the county of
his or her primary practice location, each physician was as-
signed to an HRR and in turn to a quintile of health care spend-
ing. Results are displayed using 3 categories for the exposure
variable: low spending (the lowest quintile of EOL-EI), mod-
erate spending (the middle 3 quintiles combined), and high
spending (the highest quintile of EOL-EI).
Outcomes: Physician Practice Intensity
Our analyses were based on responses to 6 clinical vignettes
from the CTS Physician Survey. Vignettes were developed to
present discretionary decisions commonly encountered in out-
patient practice--decisions that do not have a clear "correct"
response.10,11 In each question, physicians were presented with
a vignette and a proposed intervention (a treatment, referral,
or diagnostic evaluation) and were asked, "For what percent-
age of such patients would you recommend [an interven-
tion]? Consider all your patients with similar clinical descrip-
tions." Physicians could respond with any numerical percentage
between 0% and 100%. Summary measures included in
Figure 1 and Figure 2 represent the mean percentage of pa-
tients for whom physicians in a given spending quintile would
recommend an intervention.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All reported tests for trend were based on linear regression in
which the individual physician's response was the dependent
variable and the independent variable was spending in the phy-
sician's region, expressed as a continuous variable. All analy-
ses used the appropriate weights and clustering information pro-
vided by the CTS to account for sampling probability and
nonresponse, such that the results presented here are repre-
sentative of the population of nonfederal physicians providing
direct patient care to adults within the continental United States.
All analyses were carried out using SUDAAN statistical soft-
ware, version 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Tri-
angle Park, NC).
RESULTS
The sample of primary care physicians consisted of both
family/general practitioners (57%) and general inter-
nists (43%). Most were male (76%), middle-aged (mean
age, 47 years), and board certified in their specialty (80%).
The most common practice setting was a solo or 2-per-
son practice (37%).
Regions in the quintile of highest spending averaged
$8325 per capita in annual Medicare spending and 242
physicians per 100 000 persons compared with $6087 per
capita and 193 physicians per 100 000 in moderate-
spending regions and $4911 per capita and 185 physi-
cians per 100 000 in regions of low spending (Table).
The supply of hospital beds and physicians of all spe-
cialties was more abundant in regions of higher spend-
ing, with the exception of family practitioners, whose
numbers declined as local spending increased.
Physicians' clinical practice intensity varied accord-
ing to local health care spending. In 5 of 6 vignettes, pri-
mary care physicians in high-spending regions were more
likely to recommend interventions than those practic-
ing in low-spending regions (Figure 1). The sole excep-
tion was a vignette in which physicians across all spend-
ing levels were equally likely to order a cardiology
consultation for a 50-year-old man with new-onset ex-
ertional chest pain and positive results on an exercise tol-
erance test. For each of the other 5 vignettes, the aver-

age physician in a high-spending region would
recommend intervention in approximately 10 addi-
tional patients per 100 seen than would a physician in a
low-spending region. For example, the average physi-
cian in a high-spending region would recommend cho-
lesterol-lowering therapy for 53% of men whose only car-
diac risk factor was a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
level of 150 mg/dL (3.89 mmol/L), compared with 44%
for physicians in low-spending regions. As shown in
Figure 2, the association between area-level spending and
physician practice intensity was observed for both family/
general practitioners and general internists.
COMMENT
This study shows that widely differing levels of health care
spending across the United States reflect the tendency of
local physicians to recommend interventions for patients.
In high-spending areas, physicians would order further
evaluationortreatmentforapproximately10additionalpa-
tients of every 100 patients seen compared with physi-
cians in low-spending areas. This finding held true for ev-
ery clinical situation save one, in which the overwhelming
majority of physicians in all areas would have referred a
middle-aged man with chest pain and abnormal findings
on an exercise tolerance test to a cardiologist.
Several concerns may be raised about the present study.
First, because the measure of our exposure--local spend-
ing--was based on utilization of Medicare services, it
might not accurately reflect spending for the remainder
of the population (ie, persons younger than 65 years).
However, prior studies have shown strong correlations
at the area level between practice patterns for the popu-
lations younger and older than 65 years12,13 and at the
state level between Medicare spending and total per capita
health care spending.14
Second,ourfindingscouldbeinfluencedbysurveynon-
response. However, the response rate of 59% compares fa-
vorably with rates from other national telephone surveys
of physicians, which generally range from 48% to 65%.15-20
Furthermore, for nonrespondents to account for the as-
sociation between local spending and physicians' ten-
dencytointervene,theirnumberandcharacterwouldhave
to vary systematically with local spending.
Finally, some may be concerned with the use of clini-
cal vignette responses to measure physicians' tendency
to intervene for patients. Ideally, practice intensity would
be determined by ascertaining physicians' ordering and
prescribing habits for actual (identical) patients. How-
ever, because individual patients and panels of patients
differ from provider to provider, a comparison of prac-
tice intensity based on actual practice is not feasible. Clini-
cal vignettes provide a measure of actual clinical prac-
tice that is inherently case-mix adjusted: every provider
is "seeing" the same patient, portrayed in each vignette
by an adequately rich patient description. Similar meth-
ods of presenting hypothetical patient scenarios form the
basis of other important provider comparisons, notably
medical board-certifying examinations.21-23 Moreover, the
validity of using clinical vignettes as a method of assess-

ing actual physician practice has been demonstrated in
a number of studies comparing vignette responses to pro-
vider behavior with standardized patients.24-26
Others have suggested that physicians in different geo-
graphic areas practice differently. Early work showed that
the aggressiveness of a physician's proposed treatment
plan (in response to clinical vignettes) was directly as-
sociated with the per capita number of physicians in his
or her practice area (itself a close correlate of health care
spending).27 Prior work has also shown that physicians'
reported treatment and testing preferences for breast can-
cer surgery28 and cardiac catheterization29 vary mark-
edly across regions. Nevertheless, although it has long
been estimated that physicians' decisions govern the way
that 90% of each health care dollar is used,30 uncer-
tainty has remained about whether differences in health
care spending across regions reflect differences in phy-
sician behavior. Our findings demonstrate that they do.
While we have shown that physicians who practice
in areas of higher local health care spending are more
prone to intervene, we are unable to distinguish among
3 potential explanations: (1) more aggressive physi-
cians may be attracted to certain areas; (2) physicians may
adopt the practice style (or standard of practice) of the
community where they locate; or (3) characteristics of
the market itself, such as greater difficulty maintaining
target incomes in a more competitive marketplace, could
lead to a lower threshold for referral and test ordering.
Determining which of these factors is primarily respon-
sible should be the subject for further investigation.
It is unlikely that physician behavior is the sole expla-
nation for higher levels of spending in some areas. Hav-
ing more specialists or more hospital beds in an area, for
example, likely plays a role in higher levels of local spend-
ing. It is also possible that--notwithstanding similar end-
of-life preferences--differences in patient expectations and
demands across different regions impact the level of local
health care spending via direct influence on physician de-
cision making. However, in the present study we have been
able to show that, when faced with the same patients, phy-
sicians in higher-spending areas are more likely to inter-
vene, and this undoubtedly accounts for some portion of
the higher spending seen in some US regions.
