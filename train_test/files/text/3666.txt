The Expanding Role of Managed Care in the
Medicaid Program: Implications for Health
Care Access, Use, and Expenditures for
Nonelderly Adults
Kyle J. Caswell, PhD1 and Sharon K. Long, PhD1
Abstract
States increasingly use managed care for Medicaid enrollees, yet evidence of its impact on health care outcomes is mixed.
This research studies county-level Medicaid managed care (MMC) penetration and health care outcomes among nonelderly
disabled and nondisabled enrollees. Results for nondisabled adults show that increased penetration is associated with
increased probability of an emergency department visit, difficulty seeing a specialist, and unmet need for prescription drugs,
and is not associated with reduced expenditures. We find no association between penetration and health care outcomes for
disabled adults. This suggests that the primary gains from MMC may be administrative simplicity and budget predictability for
states rather than reduced expenditures or improved access for individuals.

Original Research
Introduction
States have turned to managed care as a strategy to control
health care expenditures and improve the quality of care in
the Medicaid program, with the role of managed care
expected to increase with the 2014 Medicaid expansion
under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).1-3 By focusing on effi-
cient and effective care delivery, Medicaid managed care
(MMC) is expected to lower expenditures and provide
greater administrative simplicity and budget predictability
for states and, potentially, improve access to care and health
outcomes for program enrollees. The risk, however, is that
the incentives for reduced expenditures under managed care
lead to restrictions on access and lower quality of care for
Medicaid enrollees. By 2010, 35 states and the District of
Columbia had implemented some level of fully capitated
managed care in their Medicaid programs.4 The scope of
MMC penetration varied across states, as did the population
groups affected. In general, MMC penetration is greater for
children and parents, although states are increasingly turning
to managed care for aged and disabled populations.2
The growing use of managed care by states for their
Medicaid populations has continued despite a lack of consis-
tent evidence that managed care has reduced expenditures or
improved access to care for enrollees.i Existing research
finds little evidence that managed care substantially reduces
health care expenditures, if at all, among nonelderly Medicaid
enrollees overall,5-7 or among nonelderly adults with dis-
abilities.8 Recent work by Marton et al. is one exception,
which focused on all children with Medicaid in 2 distinct
managed care programs in Kentucky during the late 1990s.9
That study found that managed care results in spending
reductions, albeit the reductions vary with different types of
managed care programs. Conversely, there is some evidence
that overall expenditures may actually have increased with
the expansion of MMC among welfare-eligible enrollees
(adults and children) in California.10
The evidence on the association between managed care and
Medicaid enrollees'access to care is also mixed. For example,
Herring and Adams found that, among nonelderly Medicaid
enrollees overall (including children), increased managed care
penetration is associated with an increase in the number of
emergency department (ED) and medical practitioner visits,
and a decrease in the number of inpatient stays and surgeries.5
They also find that higher MMC penetration increased reli-
ance of the ED as a usual source of care. In contrast, work by
Garrett and Zuckerman, who study an earlier time period,

found that mandatory health maintenance organization
(HMO) programs decreased the probability of an ED visit
among nonelderly adult Medicaid enrollees.11 The work by
Marton et al. for children discussed above finds that MMC
decreased outpatient utilization, while increasing child well-
ness visits.9 The findings for professional provider utiliza-
tion, which did not occur in a hospital outpatient or inpatient
setting, were mixed--increasing under 1 MMC model and
decreasing under the other. Among disabled adults, Burns
found that mandatory MMC enrollees did not experience
improvements in access to care,12 whereas Coughlin et al.
found that MMC led to some improvements in access to
care.13
This study builds on prior work to examine the impacts of
increasing managed care penetration on health care access,
use, and expenditures for nonelderly adults within the
Medicaid program, taking advantage of the variation in fully
capitated MMC enrollment within and across states.ii In its
approach, this work is closest to that of Herring and Adams,5
yet it is distinct along several dimensions. First, the main
independent variable in this analysis, the proportion of
Medicaid enrollees in fully capitated managed care (ie,
MMC penetration), is defined at the county level rather than
the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as in the work by
Herring and Adams.5 This difference is important as MMC is
generally implemented at the county level when states
expand their managed care delivery systems. Consequently,
there can be variation in managed care across counties within
a given MSA. Second, our work covers a more recent period
of time (2006-2009) compared with 1996 through 2003. The
more recent time period is important insofar as more time
has passed since many counties implemented MMC and the
impacts of MMC may take time to materialize, and health
care markets change over time. Third, our work distinguishes
between nonelderly Medicaid adults receiving Supplemental
Security Income (SSI), who are, by definition, severely
disabled,iii and the non-SSI Medicaid population, whereas
the work by Herring and Adams combines the two popula-
tions and adults and children. The ability to identify SSI
enrollees is important because they have different medical
needs than the non-SSI population and face different man-
aged care options under Medicaid. Finally, our work utilizes
actual medical spending data, rather than imputed expendi-
tures. In short, our study offers a more timely and stronger
assessment of the impacts of expanding MMC than has pre-
viously been available.
Results show that a higher level of county MMC penetra-
tion was associated with an increase in non-SSI enrollees'
probability of an outpatient ED visit, reported difficulty see-
ing a specialist, and reported unmet need for prescription
drugs. We also observe no evidence of reduced expenditures
associated with higher MMC penetration for this population.
Results specific to the SSI population reveal little association
between MMC and health outcomes. We find no evidence
that MMC is related to changes in access to care, use of med-
ical services, or reduced expenditures for the SSI population;
however, small sample sizes make those estimates imprecise.
Overall, the results for the non-SSI population generally cor-
roborate those from Herring and Adams of some evidence of
poorer access and no evidence of reduced expenditures. This
implies that policy makers considering expanding managed
care for their current Medicaid population, or new enrollees
in states that expand Medicaid under the ACA, should not
necessarily expect reduced expenditures or improvements to
access to health care. The primary gain from MMC for the
states may be administrative simplicity and budget predict-
ability rather than either reduced expenditures or improved
access.
Methods
Data and Sample
Several sources of data are used in this study. First, house-
hold survey data are from the Medical Expenditure Panel
Survey­Household Component (MEPS-HC), which is repre-
sentative of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population.
We pool 4 data files representing calendar years 2006 through
2009. From the MEPS-HC, we utilize detailed information
on enrollees' health care access, use, and expenditures, as
well as health insurance, disability status, and demographic
characteristics (discussed in detail below). The MEPS has a
complex survey design and sampling weights, and all point
estimates, standard errors, and significance tests reported in
this study incorporate these features of the data.
The MEPS data are supplemented with county-level
MMC penetration rates constructed from the Medicaid
Statistical Information System (MSIS) person summary files
for years 2006 through 2009.iv This is our main explanatory
variable of interest. The MSIS is a source of administrative
data, provided by each state and the District of Columbia to
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).14
From the MSIS data, we utilize information on monthly
Medicaid enrollment status among all Medicaid enrollees by
type of Medicaid (e.g., comprehensive managed care) and
basis of enrollment (e.g., disability). These penetration rates
are our key independent variable of interest (discussed in
detail below). These data were merged with the MEPS data
for individuals by county of residence and calendar year.v
In addition, we supplement the MEPS and MSIS data
with county- and state-level information culled from multi-
ple sources. These data, which are discussed in more detail
below, were used to control for important characteristics cor-
related with both the outcomes of interest and county MMC
penetration. These data are from the Behavioral Risk Factor

We imposed several restrictions on the MEPS sample
given the focus of this study. First, we limit the sample to
nonelderly Medicaid enrollees aged 19 to 64 years. Second,
we exclude dual Medicaid-Medicare enrollees given that
they face very different managed care choices. Third, we
exclude enrollees with less than full-year coverage given our
focus on health care access and expenditures over the prior
year. This insures that the access, use, and expenditure mea-
sures correspond to an equivalent period of Medicaid cover-
age. Finally, we distinguish between severely disabled
enrollees, defined as those who received SSI at any point
during the year, and nondisabled enrollees.
The pooled 2006-2009 MEPS data contain 135 030 indi-
vidual records, 124 511 of which are out of the age range for
this study or did not have Medicaid coverage at any point
during the year (restriction 1). An additional 1274 enrollees
were dual eligibles (restriction 2) and 4200 had less than full-
year coverage (restriction 3). Finally, we exclude an addi-
tional 225 records due to missing data for the control
variables included in the analysis (74) or a sampling weight
equal to 0 (151). The final sample for the analysis includes
4820 Medicaid enrollees, of whom 1011 were disabled adults
receiving SSI benefits.
Empirical Model
Managed care can have both direct and indirect effects on
health care access and expenditures for Medicaid enrollees.
For Medicaid enrollees in managed care plans, we would
expect direct effects on health care use and expenditures due
to changes in provider incentives. Changing incentives under
managed care can affect both the price of care and the quan-
tity of care provided to enrollees,23 although given the low
provider reimbursement rates under Medicaid there may be
little room to lower prices to providers under managed care.6
For Medicaid enrollees who remain in fee-for-service
Medicaid, there is the potential for spillover effects from
changes in the market and care delivery patterns as managed
care expands. Examples include Medicaid delivery system
consolidation, changes in provider practice style, and pres-
sure from market competition. 24-26
In this study, we estimate reduced form models of the
overall association between MMC penetration and enrollees'
health care access, use, and expenditures, controlling for
characteristics of the enrollee and his or her county and state.
In cases where an outcome is continuous--counts of medical
use and expenditures--we estimate 2-part models where the
first part estimates the probability of any medical use or
expenditures, and the second part estimates the level of use
or expenditures conditional on nonzero use or expenditures.

and icst is an error term. Exact definitions are discussed in
detail below. The parameter estimate of interest is 
 , which
measures the direct and indirect association of MMC pene-
tration with the outcomes of interest. Models are estimated
for the non-SSI and SSI populations in turn. This is because
the medical needs of the 2 populations are likely to differ in
ways that we cannot control for in the analysis (discussed
below) and, consequently, the impacts of managed care may
also differ for the 2 groups. Furthermore, as managed care
enrollment is higher for the non-SSI population, the param-
eter estimate 
 is likely to capture more of the direct effects
of managed care for non-SSI enrollees.
To measure the association between MMC penetration
and health care access, and any health care use or any expen-
ditures--measured as any use of particular medical services
and any medical expenditure--the function g in Equation 1
is defined as the logistic function. This is appropriate as these
outcomes are all binary. The associations between MMC
penetration and positive medical use are estimated as zero-
truncated Poisson models, and the associations with positive
medical expenditures are estimated as gamma generalized
linear models (GLMs) with a log link.
Dependent Variables (Yicst
)
The dependent variables in this analysis cover 3 broad cate-
gories: health care access, use, and expenditures. Specifically,
we study 5 access to care outcomes, where enrollees indi-
cated whether in the past year they had (1) a usual source of
care, excluding the ED; (2) any unmet need for medical care,
tests, or treatments; (3) any unmet need for prescription
drugs; (4) difficulty seeing a specialist; and (5) difficulty see-
ing a specialist, among those who reported the need to visit a
specialist.vi
Similarly, we study 4 types of medical care use. For each,
we study whether a respondent reported any use of a given
type during the last year, and among those who reported use
we study the quantity of use over the year. Types of medical
care use include inpatient stays, outpatient ED visits,vii gen-
eral doctor visits, and specialist visits. Doctor and specialist
visits include those that take place in either an outpatient- or
office-based setting.
Finally, we examine 3 different measures of medical
expenditures: total medical expenditures (all payers com-
bined, including out-of-pocket expenditures), total out-of-
pocket expenditures, and total expenditures by the Medicaid
program. As our data span several calendar years, we inflate
pre-2009 calendar year expenditure data to real 2009 US

dollars. Total expenditures and Medicaid expenditures were
inflated using the National Income and Product Accounts,
price index for gross domestic product (GDP).27 Out-of-
pocket expenditures were inflated using the all urban con-
sumers, Consumer Price Index.28 The results are not sensitive
to the choice of deflator.
MMC Penetration ( )
Pct
County MMC penetration, the main independent variable of
interest, is defined as the share of a given county's nondual
Medicaid population aged 19 to 64 enrolled in fully capitated
managed care in a given year. As noted above, the penetra-
tion rates were calculated from the MSIS data by enrollee
type (SSI and non-SSI) and account for less than full-year
enrollment status.viii In presenting the results, we focus on
the average marginal effect (AME) of these penetration rates
from the relevant logistic models, zero-truncated Poisson
models or GLM models .
As discussed above, MMC penetration captures both
direct and indirect effects of managed care on the outcomes
of interest, compared with the direct effects of individual
MMC enrollment. MMC penetration also has the advantage
of moving away from the individual enrollment decision,
which likely results in nonrandom take-up of managed care
and, thus, the potential of biased estimates of the link between
MMC enrollment and the outcomes of interest.ix Using the
penetration rates, however, may also result in biased esti-
mates if counties or states shifted from fee-for-service to
MMC in reaction to factors that also affect the health care
outcomes (such as limited provider availability). To address
this latter concern, we include an array of relevant county-
and state-level characteristics in the model (discussed
below).
Other Independent Variables X C S
it ct-1 st-1
, ,
( )
We control for a rich array of individual characteristics asso-
ciated with the outcomes of interest ( )
Xit . Demographic
controls include sex, age (19-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-64),
race/ethnicity (white/non-Hispanic, black/non-Hispanic,
Hispanic, and other/non-Hispanic), marital status (married,
never married, widowed/divorced/separated), US citizenship
status, and highest educational attainment (less than high
school, high school graduate, greater than high school).
Health characteristics include both physical and mental
health status (excellent or very good, good, fair or poor) and
the number of chronic and nonchronic health conditions.
Family-level controls (defined over health insurance eligibil-
ity units [HIEUs])x include family income with respect to the
Federal Poverty Level (FPL; less than 50%, 50%-100%,
100%-150%, 150%-200%, 200% and greater), the number of
dependent family members,xi and whether there was some-
one in the family with a chronic condition other than the
sample member.
To further isolate the link between county MMC penetra-
tion and the outcomes of interest, we include lagged county-
and state-level variables to address the potential of MMC
policy endogeneity and to control for important environmen-
tal factors that are likely to affect the outcomes, such as pro-
vider supply ( ).
C ,S
ct- st-
1 1 Policy endogeneity would arise if
there were characteristics of a state (or its counties) that
affected both the outcomes of interest and the state's policy
decisions with respect to MMC, such as whether to imple-
ment or expand MMC. Failing to control for such factors in
the analysis would lead to biased estimates.xii
The county and state measures come from multiple
sources and were merged with the MEPS data by the indi-
viduals' county/state of residence by year. To account for the
state policy environment, we include 3 state-level variables.
The first 2 are state expenditures as percent of revenues,18
and state GDP per capita,16,17 which serve as proxies for bud-
getary pressures in the state. Increased pressure may influ-
ence the decision to shift from fee-for-service to managed
care if it is perceived to result in savings. The third state
policy environment variable is state Medicaid income eligi-
bility as percent of FPL for a working-parent family of 3,19
which is a proxy for the state's Medicaid eligibility generos-
ity. States with more generous programs will have more eli-
gibles, all else equal, and are possibly more motivated to
seek savings by shifting to managed care.
Local (county level) health care market characteristics
will affect the Medicaid enrollees' access to and use of care,
and may also affect decisions on the implementation of
MMC across geographic areas in a state. We include 4
county-level controls to capture the supply side of the local
environment: the number of hospital beds per 1000 individu-
als, the number of primary care physicians per 1000 indi-
viduals, whether the county has 1 or more Federally Qualified
Health Centers, and the number of hospitals with an ED per
1000 individuals.16 A relatively low capacity to provide med-
ical care may impact enrollees' access to care, treatment set-
ting, and expenditures, which in turn may influence decisions
to shift to managed care. We also include the Medicare +
Choice Hospital Insurance aged payment rate as a proxy for
the price of medical services in the county.16 Higher prices
for services, holding quantity and other factors constant,
influence expenditures on services, which is important to
control for by itself. Nonetheless, higher prices could influ-
ence counties' decisions to shift to managed care for per-
ceived savings.
To capture health care needs in the local market, we
include the share of adults diagnosed with diabetes15 and
median household income per capita at the county level.20
These are rough proxies for population health that in turn
influences the quantity of medical services demanded in the
local market. And depending on the capacity of the local
health care market, it may impact access and use of services,
expenditures, and county decisions to shift to managed care.
We also include county population per square mile,16 as
Caswell and Long 5
urban areas, with their larger population bases, are more con-
ducive to managed care. Finally, we include a binary variable
that indicates whether the county participates in Primary
Care Case Management (PCCM) for its Medicaid enrollees,
calculated from the MSIS administrative data.xiii This is
important as PCCM is distinct from capitated managed care,
and PCCM penetration is correlated with capitated managed
care penetration as PCCM is often a first step toward capi-
tated managed care. Likewise, though similar, PCCM health
care delivery systems produce different incentives for pro-
viders than capitated programs that may influence the out-
comes studied here.
Additional Specifications
Although the MMC penetration rate is our primary indepen-
dent variable of interest, we supplement these findings with
5 alternative specifications to evaluate the robustness of our
results. First we estimate models where the penetration rate
is lagged 1 year, as lagged penetration is arguably more
exogenous than contemporary penetration.xiv Second, we
estimate models where the penetration rate corresponds only
to counties with mandatory MMC, where the rate equals 0 in
nonmandatory counties. Data on mandatory MMC come
from CMS, National Summary of State Medicaid Managed
Care Programs, and Medicaid Managed Care Enrollment
Report.21,22 Third, models are estimated with a binary vari-
able indicating whether the county has mandatory MMC
program by subpopulation,xv and a fourth specification with
a binary indicator for whether there is any MMC in the
county for a given subpopulation. The final specification
includes a binary indicator from the MEPS data, where
respondents reported that they are enrolled in a MMC plan.
Limitations
Our estimates of the link between county MMC penetration
and health care access, use, and expenditures do not neces-
sarily identify causal effects. Although we estimate rich
models, there may be important omitted variables that affect
both county MMC penetration and the study outcomes that
could bias our estimates of the effect of MMC. For example,
although we attempt to control for MMC policy endogeneity,
factors influencing state policy decisions do so with a lag
that is likely to be longer than that which we are able to con-
trol for. Thus, it is likely that we reduce but do not eliminate
such bias. Second, we focus on adults with full-year Medicaid
to link access, use, and expenditures over the year to
Medicaid coverage for the same time period. However, as a
substantial share of non-SSI Medicaid enrollees cycle in and
out of coverage, the results reported here may not be gener-
alizable to the full Medicaid population. Third, we focus on
national estimates, knowing that Medicaid and MMC vary
considerably across the states. The results reported here pro-
vide the average effects across the nation and are not neces-
sarily applicable to individual states or counties. That is, our
sample is too small to control for state (or county) fixed
effects, which is a limitation of the data. Finally, we focus on
payments for health care services in this analysis and so do
not capture the full expenditures of administering the
Medicaid program under managed care and fee-for-service
Medicaid.
Results
Summary Statistics
Table 1 reports on the distribution of county MMC penetra-
tion faced by non-SSI and SSI Medicaid enrollees in the
MEPS, combined over years 2006 to 2009. MMC penetra-
tion was generally greater among non-SSI enrollees than SSI
enrollees. For example, average MMC penetration among
respondents in the MEPS subsample equals 33.4% for SSI
enrollees and 64.1% among non-SSI enrollees (see Table 1).
Likewise, one-half of non-SSI enrollees resided in counties
with MMC penetration equal to 80.8% or higher, whereas
half of SSI enrollees resided in counties with MMC penetra-
tion at 21.1% or higher. In addition to MMC penetration,
three-quarters of non-SSI respondents reported they were
enrolled in a managed care plan, as did approximately 63%
of SSI enrollees (see Table A1 of the appendix). Finally,
82.4% of non-SSI enrollees resided in an area with manda-
tory MMC, whereas less than half (45.9%) of SSI respon-
dents resided in mandatory MMC areas over the period
(Table A1).
Table 2 reports summary statistics on health care access,
use, and expenditures--the dependent variables in this anal-
ysis--by SSI status. Nearly 90% of the SSI and 80% of the

non-SSI enrollees reported that they had a usual source of
care other than the ED during the year. Less than 8% of SSI
enrollees and less than 4% of non-SSI enrollees reported
unmet need for medical care or prescription drugs during the
year. Reflecting their higher health care needs, health care
use and expenditures were greater among SSI enrollees,
although the majorities of both groups have some medical
spending during the year. For example, nearly 95% of SSI
enrollees, and 85% of non-SSI enrollees, reported nonzero
medical spending during the year. Table A1 reports summary
statistics for the control variables used in this analysis by SSI
status.
Average Marginal Effects
Table 3 reports estimates of the Average Marginal Effect
(AME) associated with changes in county MMC penetration
from the health care access, use, and expenditures models.
These are estimates of the change in the probability of a
given event, unit of service, or change in medical spending,
corresponding (approximately) to a 1 percentage point
change in county MMC penetration.xvi Table A2 of the
appendix provides an example of the complete estimation
results for whether non-SSI enrollees reported an outpatient
ED visit (logit model), and Tables A3 and A4 provide the full
range of alternative modelspecifications.
Among non-SSI enrollees (left, Panel A, Table 3), who are
more likely to be enrolled in MMC, we find that an increase in
county MMC penetration is associated with an increase in the
probability of reporting unmet need for prescription drugs
(P < .10) and difficulty seeing a specialist (P < .10 among all
non-SSI enrollees, and P < .05 for those who reported need to
see a specialist). Furthermore, increasing county MMC pene-
tration increases the probability of reporting an ED visit (P <
.01) among non-SSI enrollees. (Below we report results over
the entire range of county MMC penetration to illustrate the
magnitude of the main findings.) Results from the additional
specifications, reported in Table A3, generally corroborate the
results discussed here.xvii Despite the finding of increased dif-
ficulty seeing a specialist, we find no evidence that increased
MMC penetration decreased the probability of visiting a spe-
cialist (Panel A), or the number of specialist visits among
those who visited one (Panel B). We also find no evidence of a
significant change in the probability of positive medical
expenditures. Nor do we find any evidence that MMC penetra-
tion is associated with the quantity of medical use more gener-
ally among those who use services, or medical expenditures
among those with positive expenditures (Panel B, Table 3).
Results for the SSI population are generally insignificant
(right, Table 3). Although there appears to be some evidence
of a positive association between MMC penetration and the
number of inpatient visits, results appear sensitive alternative

generally shift additional groups of individuals into man-
aged care so that MMC penetration increases by more
than a small margin.
Panel A of Figure 1 shows the predicted probability of any
outpatient ED visit at different levels of county MMC pene-
tration among nonelderly adult non-SSI enrollees. For exam-
ple, at 10% MMC penetration, the probability of any
outpatient ED visit (Panel A) is estimated to be 19.3%,
whereas at a MMC penetration of 80%, the probability of ED
visit increases to 24.2%. That is, an increase in MMC pene-
tration from a relatively low level to MMC as the dominant
care delivery system increases the probability of any outpa-
tient ED visit by 4.9 percentage points for non-SSI enrollees,
which is a 25.4% increase.
Figure 1 also plots the predicted probabilities for reported
difficulty seeing a specialist among those who reported the
need to see one (Panel B) and among all non-SSI enrollees
(Panel D), and unmet need for prescription drugs (Panel C) at
different levels of county MMC penetration. As shown, the
estimated probability of reported difficulty seeing a special-
ist, among those who reported need to see one, increases 9.5
percentage points (from 32.3% to 41.8%, for an increase of
29.4%) as MMC penetration rises from 10% to 80%. The
proportional increase for reported difficulty seeing a special-
ist is similar, from 10% to 80% penetration, among the entire
non-SSI population (Panel D): 27.5% or 2.8 percentage
points (from 10.2% to 13.0%). Finally, the probability of
reported unmet need for prescription drugs (Panel C)
increases by 100.0%, or 1.7 percentage points (from 1.7% to
3.4%) with the same shift in MMC penetration.
Discussion
This study finds that increased MMC penetration in a county
is associated with an increase in the probability of an ED
visit, and reported difficulty seeing a specialist and unmet
need for prescription drugs among nonelderly non-SSI
Medicaid adults. Furthermore, we find no evidence of
reduced expenditures associated with increased MMC pene-
tration for the non-SSI population. For nonelderly SSI
Medicaid adults, we observe no consistent evidence that
MMC penetration influences medical care access, use, or
expenditures. We do not, however, interpret this as evidence
that MMC has no impact on the outcomes examined. Our

SSI sample is small, raising concerns about the precision of
our estimates for this subpopulation, a limitation of the
MEPS sample size.
Overall these results, especially among non-SSI Medicaid
enrollees, seemingly contradict conventional theories on the
expenditures and benefits of managed care. That is, man-
aged care is generally intended to provide access to appro-
priate care in a timely, efficient, and cost-effective way by
shifting the locus of care from higher cost settings to pri-
mary care. If successful, one would expect higher levels of
primary care use, lower levels of specialist use that could be
provided in primary care settings, lower levels of unmet
need for care, and lower levels of inpatient stays and ED
visits for ambulatory care sensitive conditions, and, as a
result, reduced expenditures associated with those changes.
Nonetheless, incentive structures created by managed care
organizations may not always result in intended/desired
outcomes.
There are characteristics of states' Medicaid programs
that may lead to outcomes that are inconsistent with conven-
tional managed care theory. The largest factor, perhaps, is
the programs' low reimbursement rates. Low rates, com-
bined with incentives to reduce expenditures within man-
aged care organizations, could lead to reductions in
appropriate access to care and/or quality of care should it
limit the number and/or quality of providers available (e.g.,
narrow limits on number or type of prescription drugs or
specialist care). Furthermore, reductions in appropriate care
could eventually lead to more high-cost care (e.g., inpatient
and/or ED care). Furthermore, the opportunities for both
more cost-effective and lower cost care delivery will depend
on a given state's starting point. That is, states with low
reimbursement rates and/or efficient care delivery systems
will offer fewer opportunities for changes that generate
reduced expenditures. Finally, specific incentives faced by
providers and hospitals, defined by managed care organiza-
tions, are not the same across organizations and may impact
populations in different ways as demonstrated in the work
by Marton et al.9
Results in this study for non-SSI adult enrollees are quali-
tatively consistent with those in the work by Herring and
Adams.5 If enrollees are more likely to utilize the outpatient
ED, along with no perceptible decrease in general doctor
and/or specialist visits as MMC penetration increases, enroll-
ees may not necessarily experience less access to care.
However, it is not clear that this would improve the welfare
of enrollees. Herring and Adams,5 who studied the SSI and
non-SSI nonelderly populations together (including chil-
dren), found that increased MMC penetration associates with
medical care use patterns which the authors interpret as not
welfare improving--such as increased reliance on the ED for
a usual source of care, and increased number of ED visits.
Finally, the lack of effect of MMC on Medicaid expenditures
in our work is also consistent with these authors' research, as
well as more recent work by Duggan and Hayford.6
Taken together, these results raise concerns about the fea-
sibility of states achieving their goals of controlling health
care expenditures and improving care by expanding use of
MMC. The greatest gains for states may be administrative
gains and budget predictability rather than either reduced
expenditures or improved access.
The implication of these findings are of particular concern
for the SSI population, given their greater health care needs
and higher health care expenditures; however, more research
with larger sample sizes is needed to more fully address the
implications of MMC for this subpopulation. Given the limi-
tations of national data sources for the SSI population, this
work highlights the need for state-specific studies that could
provide the sample size needed to better assess the implica-
tions of MMC for these vulnerable adults. Recent work by
Marton et al.,9 who study children in 2 managed care plans in
Kentucky, is a step in this direction. However, further work
that focuses on the disabled, adults, and additional states is
needed. In addition, future work would benefit from going
beyond the general measures available in MEPS to consider
additional dimensions of care. For example, quality of care
and patient experiences based on the Healthcare Effectiveness
Data and Information Set (HEDIS), or the Consumer
Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS),
could be insightful.
Our findings for the non-SSI population will help to
inform the trend toward medical homes and accountable care
organizations (ACOs). That is, to the extent that medical
homes and ACOs in Medicaid are based on the MMC model,
the benefits generated from these alternatives may also be
limited. Silow-Carroll et al.,3 however, highlight that the
ACO model with its focus on greater integration and coordi-
nation of care, and greater emphasis on high-risk individuals,
could offer greater improvements in care than have been
generated by the traditional MMC model to date. These
authors also note that many managed care organizations,
including MMC organizations, are shifting toward the ACO
model. Consequently, if the ACO model is more successful
in achieving its intended benefits than the current MMC
model, such a move could improve MMC. Going forward, it
will be important to study whetherACOs and medical homes,
whether stand-alone models or models developed as part of
MMC plans, can produce the improvements over fee-for-
service Medicaid that to date have largely proven elusive
with MMC.

Note. Results are estimates of average predicted probabilities for medical use over the range of Medicaid managed care penetration from logistic models. See the "Methods"
section for details on model specification. Results in bold correspond to 10% and 80% MMC penetration, respectively, and which are the levels emphasized in Figure 1 and in
the text.

Notes
i. See a recent and comprehensive review of the literature on
Medicaid managed care (MMC) and its relationship with
expenditures, access, and quality of health care by Sparer.1
ii. States also rely on partially capitated managed care, which
tends to cover a single service, such as behavioral health, den-
tal care, or transportation, or Primary Care Case Management
(PCCM) programs, which provide a supplement to fee-for-
service rates for care coordination.
 iii. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) provides cash assistance
to low-income aged and disabled individuals, with most SSI
beneficiaries automatically eligible for Medicaid by virtue of
their receipt of SSI.29
iv. During the time this research was conducted, the 2009
Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) person sum-
mary file was the most recent available, which is why we use
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data through 2009
(and not 2010).
 v. The research in this article was conducted at the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Data Center in
Rockville, MD. .
 vi. This information is from the self-administered adult question-
naire that includes the question (number 16),30 "In the last 12
months, did you or a doctor think you needed to see a special-
ist?" If affirmative, the subsequent question is "In the last 12
months, how often was it easy to see a specialist that you needed
to see?" to which they could choose "never," "sometimes,"
"usually," or "always." We define "difficult seeing a specialist"
as responses equal to "never [easy]" or "sometimes [easy]."
 vii. Outpatient emergency department visits are those that do not
result in an inpatient admission.
viii. To account for the fact that beneficiaries had less than full-year
enrollment, penetration rates are defined as the sum of eligibil-
ity months over a given 12-month period divided by the num-
ber of eligibles in a given month over a given 12-month period.
 ix. Although more of an issue in voluntary MMC programs, self-
selectionisalsoaconcerninmandatoryprograms,whereexemp-
tions and exclusions from managed care are often available.
x. Health insurance eligibility units (HIEUs) are defined as group
family members who are normally eligible for health insurance
through the adult family members' health insurance policy.
For more details, see documentation on the 2010 MEPS­
Household Component (MEPS-HC) data file, p. C-29.31
xi. Dependents are defined as children aged 0 to 19, and
young adults 18 to 23 who are full-time students and never
married.
xii. Ideally, these variables would be specified with a longer lag.
However, we are limited by data availability for previous years.
For other literature which controls for policy endogeneity, see
work by Besley and Case, and, more recently, Monheit et al.32.33
xiii. County PCCM is the only county-level control variable not
specified with a lag, resulting in a slight abuse of notation.
This is because we do not have MSIS data for years prior to
2006. As a result, including this information with a lag will
result in dropping all MEPS observations from calendar year
2006. We consider the benefit of adding this information with-
out a lag greater than the cost of dropping a year of MEPS data
or omitting the control variable.
xiv. These specifications result in smaller sample size, omitting
data for 2006, as we do not have penetration rates for years
prior to 2006.
 xv.
The correlation between the penetration rate and the binary
mandatory MMC flag is (predictably) very high (approxi-
mately .75). Consequently, models that include both explan-
atory variables simultaneously most likely suffer from
multicollinearity and are not reported here.
xvi.
As the penetration rates are continuous, these estimates
represent instantaneous rates of change associated with a
change in the penetration rate. Below we report results over
the full range of MMC to shed light on the magnitude of
these results at all values of MMC.
xvii.
Although there is some evidence that MMC penetration is
associated with increased probability of a general doctor
visit in Table 3, there is less evidence to support this finding
among the alternative specifications in Table A3.
xviii.
Among statistically insignificant estimates common to both
subpopulations, confidence intervals of estimates for the SSI
population are generally much wider. That is, the "zeros" are
less precisely estimated for the non-SSI enrollees.
