DOSE-RESPONSE CURVES IN CHEMICAL CARCINOGENESIS
William J. Waddell  Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School
of Medicine, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY
 Extrapolation from studies of chemical carcinogenicity in rodents, at high doses, to humans, at the
typically low doses to which we are exposed, has been one of the most controversial issues in toxicology.
Many chemical carcinogenesis experiments currently are evaluated on a linear scale for dose. Log
dose has been the standard for decades in pharmacology and toxicology for noncancer toxicities
and there is no reason to think that it should not apply to chemical carcinogenesis. Furthermore,
log dose is consistent with fundamental principles of chemistry. Direct comparisons of linear and
logarithmic scales for dose illustrate the deceptive nature of linear plots for dose; low doses, which is
where our interest lies in comparing human exposures, are compressed beyond evaluation by a linear
scale. Unequivocal thresholds for carcinogenicity are shown when the dose-response curves for animal
studies done at high doses are evaluated on a log scale for dose. This observation now raises the issue
of the relevance to human exposures of these high-dose experiments in animals. Studies analyzed by
this log dose to linear response procedure demonstrate that the thresholds from animal experiments
can be used to calculate safety factors for human exposure and that humans are more resistant than
animals to carcinogenesis from chemicals.

INTRODUCTION
The shapes of dose-response curves were first analyzed critically by
Gaddum (1945) when he recognized empirically that dose should be plotted
on a logarithmic scale for a linear quantal response. Pharmacologists have
been plotting dose on a logarithmic scale ever since that publication. Toxi-
cologists have also used that scale for noncancer experiments but, for some
unexplained reason, most authors of chemical carcinogenesis experiments
have instead preferred a linear scale for dose. Gaddum did not offer a basic
scientific reason for the logarithmic scale, but Waddell (2002) proposed that
this was consistent with the concept of chemical potential and the law of mass
action and that it should apply to all quantal responses, including chemical
carcinogenesis. The linear plot for dose is very deceptive and compresses low
doses so that evaluation in that range is impossible; however, this has not
heretofore been clearly recognized. This paper is an attempt to demonstrate
that deception and the difficulty in evaluating effects at low doses. More

complete demonstrations of thresholds for carcinogenesis are presented
in previous publications (Waddell, 2002, 2003a, 2003b, 2003c, 2003d). The
Rozman scale (Rozman, et al., 1996) was used in all these analyses because
it is ideally suited for evaluation of chemical carcinogenesis. The thresholds
that are demonstrated from the animal experiments can be used to calculate
safety factors for human exposure. In some instances human exposures are
at or very near the thresholds in animal experiments (Waddell, 2003d). This
indicates that humans are more resistant to the carcinogenic effect of at least
some chemicals.
METHODS
SlideWrite Plus, Version 6, from Advanced Graphics Software, Encinitas,
California, was used for all of the calculations and graphs, except of course
the figures reproduced from the original ED01 report. Data from the ED01
(Littlefield et al., 1980) and the Peto et al. (1991) reports were used to plot the
percent liver and esophageal tumors, respectively, against dose on either a lin-
ear (as was done in the original reports) or a logarithmic scale. The Rozman
et al. (1996) scale is ideal for the abscissa; it was used for the logarithmic
scale for three reasons. First, it is logarithmic for dose and linear for effect,
which is consistent with fundamental principles of chemistry (Waddell and
Bates, 1969). Second, it is continuous down to one molecule, which allows
comparison of all doses. And third, it uses molecules per kilogram instead
of mg/kg, ppm, and so forth, which allows direct comparison of compounds
with different molecular weights.
RESULTS
Figure 1 is reproduced from Figure 4 of the Littlefield et al. (1980) pub-
lication to show how the original results of the ED01 study on 2-acetylamino-
fluorene for liver neoplasms were presented for evaluation. Note that both
abscissa and ordinate are linear scales and that the values for tumors in the
unexposed animals are shown at zero dose. Figure 2 shows the same data,
on the same scales, after subtracting the number of tumors in each of the
control groups. The linear extrapolations for each of the three time intervals
do indeed appear to be pointed in the general direction of the 0, 0 origins;
however, it should be noted carefully that the lines do not extend exactly
to those origins. Figure 3 shows the range of doses that were studied in the
ED01 report; it also indicates how the extrapolations lie in the narrow space
for doses approximately at or below 1019. This is, of course, where our inter-
est lies for extrapolation to doses to which humans likely might be exposed.
Figure 4 shows the same doses that were used in the ED01 study plotted on the
logarithmic scale of Rozman et al. (1996) which demonstrates how much the
linear scale compressed the doses below 1019 and made it virtually impossible

to discern the exact value of their intercepts. Figure 5 shows the same data
that were presented in Figure 2, but now plotted on the logarithmic scale
for dose. With this plot all doses are placed in perspective and the intercepts
with the abscissa are readily evaluated.
Figure 6 shows the data from Table 3 of the Peto et al. (1991) publication
for the percent esophageal tumors produced in rats from N-nitrosodiethyl-
amine in the drinking water. The data are plotted on linear scales for both
the abscissa and the ordinate as was done in the Peto et al. article. This
demonstrates how compression of the low doses deceptively suggests that the
extrapolation may indicate that there is no threshold for tumor production
from the chemical. Indeed, that was the conclusion of those authors. How-
ever, careful inspection does show an intercept of the line on the abscissa
above zero. It is the compression of the scale, for low doses that is decep-
tive. Figure 7 shows the same data plotted on the logarithmic scale, where all
doses are placed in perspective and the intercept of the extrapolation with
the abscissa well above a single molecule is clearly shown.
Figure 8 shows a hypothetical chemical that produces tumors in 3.1% of
the animals when administered 55 mg/kg/day. The extrapolation is based on
the assumption that the data extend linearly to the 0, 0 origins. With this same
interpretation, in order to have only one tumor in a million individuals, the
dose would be 0.002 mg/kg/day. Figure 9 illustrates how the same numbers

could be used to extrapolate to one in a million deaths from actual data
on highway deaths in the United States per thousand injuries at a speed of
55 mph (Baker et al., 1992). This same thinking would set the speed limit at
0.002 mph.

DISCUSSION
The precise relationship of the dose of a chemical to its effect on bio-
logical systems has always been important to pharmacologists and toxicol-
ogists. Indeed, it is the basis of the distinction between pharmacology and

the linearized multistage. Data at 55 mph are from Baker et al. (1992).

toxicology. The transition from a useful, therapeutic, or pharmacological
effect to an adverse or toxic effect depends on the dose, and the nature
of that transition is described by the dose-response curve. Gaddum (1945)
was the first to recognize and describe, based merely on empirical observa-
tions, that biological measurements (and in particular dose of a chemical)
should be considered on a logarithmic scale in order to effect a linear quan-
tal response. He further introduced the additional statistical correction for
normal distributions by incorporating the standard deviation into his "log-
normal distribution" graphs or probit plots. Pharmacologists have used probit
paper to obtain linear correlations between doses of chemicals and effects
for decades. There seems to be no criticism of this time-honored relation-
ship. Toxicologists have also considered this relationship as standard for all
noncancer adverse effects. However, it is curious that, when carcinogenesis
is under discussion, dose is usually considered on a linear scale. Perhaps this
arose from the notion that a single molecule might produce cancer and that
just a few molecules were important; consequently, logarithmic notation was
considered unnecessary.
This "linear-dose" thinking has predominated in the analysis of chemical
carcinogenesis and, in particular, in extrapolation from experiments in ani-
mals to risk assessment in humans. The principle of this thinking presumes
that any dose or doses that cause a statistical increase in tumors in experi-
mental animals can be assumed to decrease linearly, with dose on a linear
scale, to zero dose. This assumes that, in a sufficiently large population, zero
tumors will be produced only with a zero dose of the chemical. Humans are
being exposed to an increasing number of chemicals that have been shown
to be carcinogenic in animals, and epidemiological studies frequently do not
concur that there is an increase in cancer in humans exposed to these same
chemicals. Consequently, many observers have questioned this assumption
of a linear extrapolation to zero dose (e.g., to cite but a few, Waddell 1993,
1996, 2003d; Rozman et al., 2001).
Although Gaddum (1945) recognized empirically that dose on a logarith-
mic scale effected a linear quantal response, he apparently did not recognize
the fundamental principle that explained it. The logarithmic relationship of
dose to any quantal response emanates from basic principles of chemistry.
The chemical potential of a substance, when its chemical potential in the
standard state is zero, may be stated as follows: Âµ = RT ln a, where Âµ is the
chemical potential whose activity is represented by a, R is the gas constant,
and T is the absolute temperature. Alternatively, differences in chemical po-
tential between two activities (concentrations) are directly proportional to
the logarithm of the ratios of the activities: Âµ1
- Âµ2
= RT ln a1
- RT ln
a2 or Âµ1
- Âµ2
= RT ln (a1/a2). Another consideration is the law of mass
action: A + B  C + D, where A, B, C, and D represent concentrations of
reactants and products, respectively. The displacement from equilibrium, or
Dose-Response Curves in Chemical Carcinogenesis 19
steady state, of this reaction by the addition of an additional quantity of A
will depend on the concentration of A at the initial equilibrium (or steady
state). For example, the addition of 1 mmol of A will have a greater effect on
the reaction if the concentration of A is 1 mmol at initial equilibrium than it
will if the initial concentration of A is 100 mmol.
The direct comparisons of dose on linear and logarithmic scales in this
paper are intended to demonstrate the artifactual problem with the linear
plot. Not only is it not consistent with the basic principles of chemistry, but
it makes discernment of events in the low-dose range impossible.
Previous publications using the Rozman scale for the analysis of chemical
carcinogenesis experiments in animals mostly show thresholds in animals
well above doses to which humans are exposed (Waddell, 2002, 2003d). In
these cases a safety factor can be shown. In other studies, human exposures
are at or very near the animal thresholds, yet no human cancers are seen at
these doses (Waddell, 2003d). This is interpreted to indicate that humans are
more resistant to the carcinogenic effect of these chemicals and gives some
reassurance of safety even when humans are exposed to the threshold dose
in animals.
Figures 8 and 9 are merely intended to illustrate the severe flaw in a
linear extrapolation that forces the line through the 0, 0 origins. By ignoring
information in the low-dose (or low-mph) range, absurd results are obtained.
For example, the number of deaths at only 1 or 2 mph may already be zero
without extension to 0.002 mph. The shape of the dose-response, or deaths
at different highway speeds, curves needs to be determined without forcing
the response through the 0, 0 origins.
