Non-technical summary
Research question
The communication costs between the headquarters of multinational firms and the em-
ployees at foreign production plants are higher than those between the headquarters and
employees at domestic production plants, for example due to telecommunication costs,
language or time zone differences. They inhibit the diffusion of knowledge within multi-
national firms. The present paper studies how these communication frictions affect the
optimal organization of knowledge in multinational firms.
Contribution
The paper provides the first in-depth study of the organization of knowledge in multina-
tional firms. The paper shows that the organization of knowledge in multinational firms
provides a single theoretical mechanism that explains both the geography of multinational
firms' sales and investments and the emergence of multinational firm wage premiums, two
issues that have been separately analyzed in the literature so far.
Results
The paper develops a theoretical model that studies how firms optimally split knowledge
between their headquarters and their production plants. The model shows that multi-
national firms systematically assign more knowledge to both their foreign and domestic
plants than non-multinationals due to the communication frictions with the foreign plants.
This helps explain why multinational firms pay higher wages to their production work-
ers than non-multinational firms, and why their sales and their investment probability
decrease across space. Multinational firms use corporate transferees to transfer know-
ledge within their bounda-ries. Empirical evidence from data on corporate transferees
confirms the model predictions for multinationals' organization of knowledge. Data on
German multinational firms from the Microdatabase Direct investment (MiDi) corrobo-
rate the implications of the model in relation to the geography of multinationals' sales
and investments.

foreign and domestic plants than non-multinationals. This helps explain why multi-
national firms pay higher wages to their production workers than non-multinational
firms, and why their sales and their investment probability decrease across space.

1 Introduction
In today's economy, knowledge is an essential production factor. Knowledge is typically
tacit and embodied in individual employees. Production processes are complex and in-
volve many different employees. The efficient organization of knowledge is therefore a
key ingredient for firms' success. It determines in which part of the production process
employees specialize, and to whom they turn for help if they encounter a problem that
they are not able to solve. Firms organize knowledge to match the problems that arise in
production to the employees with the knowledge to solve them.
A growing body of literature studies the organization of knowledge in firms. So far,
the literature assumes that the costs of communication between employees are constant
throughout a firm, so searching for help is equally costly for all employees. This assump-
tion is a good approximation for the interaction of employees in small firms, active in a
single location. However, it is likely to be overly simplistic in the study of large firms
with production plants in different locations, and it certainly does not apply to multina-
tional firms, a very important subgroup of firms.1 Multinational firms have headquarters
in their home country that communicate with plants in the home country and in for-
eign countries. The communication costs between the headquarters and the plants vary
across countries. Language barriers, time zone differences, and lack of face-to-face in-
teraction render cross-border communication within a multinational production network
more difficult than communication within a domestic firm. Such communication frictions
impede the diffusion of knowledge within multinational firms and hamper the access of
foreign plants to headquarter knowledge. Yet, the question of how multinational firms
optimally organize knowledge in the presence of heterogeneous communication costs is so
far unexplored.
This paper provides the first in-depth study of the organization of knowledge in multi-
national firms. The paper develops a theory and confirms its predictions using novel data
on the flows of corporate transferees between countries and data on German multinational
firms.
In particular, I construct a stylized model of multinational firms in the spirit of
the knowledge hierarchies framework (e.g., Antr`
as, Garicano, and Rossi-Hansberg, 2006;
Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg, 2012; Garicano, 2000). To keep the model analytically
tractable and make the special features of multinational firms' organization transparent,
I assume that the total knowledge level of firms is exogenously given and fix the number
1The share of multinational firms in all firms is low, but they account for a substantial fraction of
aggregate output and employment: less than 1% of U.S. manufacturing firms are multinationals, but
they account for a third of manufacturing output and 26% of manufacturing employment (Bernard and
Jensen, 2007).

of hierarchical layers. Firms consist of two layers: managers in the domestic corporate
headquarters and workers in production plants that can be located in the same country as
the headquarters, or a foreign country, or both. Firms endogenously choose the number
of managers and workers, as well as the proportion of the total knowledge that they learn.
To derive the consequences of the organization of knowledge for firm behavior, I embed
the model of the organization of knowledge in a heterogeneous firm model of foreign direct
investment (FDI) similar to Helpman, Melitz, and Yeaple (2004). I assume that firms are
heterogeneous with respect to their total knowledge level. Each firm optimally organizes
its knowledge. The organization of knowledge yields endogenous marginal production
costs that are heterogeneous across firms. This makes it possible to derive predictions on
firms' sales and on the self-selection of firms into FDI.
Three results summarize the main insights on the optimal organization of knowledge
in multinational firms. First, the optimal knowledge level at a plant increases with the
communication costs between the plant and the headquarters. A multinational firm thus
assigns more knowledge to its foreign plant than to its domestic plant to avoid the higher
cross-border communication costs. Foreign plants master a higher share of the production
process by themselves and approach the headquarters for help less frequently.
Second, multinational firms assign less knowledge to their headquarters than non-
multinational firms (i.e., purely domestic firms or exporters). This is because foreign
plants use headquarter knowledge less frequently than if they were domestic plants due to
their higher knowledge level. Consequently, the utilization rate of headquarter knowledge
in multinational firms is lower than the utilization rate in non-multinationals. Providing
knowledge at headquarters is costly, though. A multinational firm chooses to maintain a
lower level of knowledge at its headquarters to balance its utilization rate and its costs.
Third, the lower level of knowledge at the headquarters of a multinational firm also
affects its domestic production plants: Multinational firms assign more knowledge to their
domestic plants than non-multinational firms. Multinationals' headquarters have less
knowledge than the headquarters of non-multinational firms, so multinationals' domestic
plants have to learn more knowledge to ensure the efficiency of production. The knowledge
level of a multinational's domestic plants is typically still lower than the knowledge level of
the foreign plants, so the optimal knowledge levels at the different plants of a multinational
firm are heterogeneous.
The optimal organization of knowledge yields endogenous marginal production costs.
The marginal costs depend on the total knowledge level of the firm and home and for-
eign country characteristics because these variables affect the organization of knowledge.
A special feature of multinational firms with foreign and domestic production plants is
that their marginal costs are interdependent across countries. This result arises because
2
several production plants share common headquarters. In consequence, and consistent
with the empirical evidence (Antr`
as and Yeaple, 2014; Tomiura, 2007), multinational and
non-multinational firms with the same marginal costs endogenously coexist in the home
and the foreign country, unlike in models that assume firms to be heterogeneous in pro-
ductivity. Through the endogenous marginal costs, the organization of knowledge helps
explain distinct stylized facts concerning multinational firms.
It is well-known and empirically documented that multinational firms pay higher wages
to their production workers than equally productive domestic firms (so-called "resid-
ual multinational firm wage premiums", see, e.g., Aitken, Harrison, and Lipsey, 1996).
Nonetheless, theoretical explanations are scarce. The organization of knowledge helps ex-
plain the residual multinational wage premiums: Multinationals assign more knowledge
to their production plants than non-multinationals, and this knowledge is remunerated.
The wage premiums vary with home and foreign country characteristics because these
affect the organization of knowledge. The model thus explains why multinational wage
premiums depend on the nationality of the acquirer (as found by Girma and G¨
org, 2007).
The self-selection of firms into FDI reinforces the wage premiums.
Likewise, it is a well-known stylized fact that foreign sales and investment probability
decrease with the distance of a country from a multinational's home country (e.g., Antr`
as
and Yeaple, 2014).2 The organization of knowledge provides a novel explanation for this
empirical regularity. The endogenous marginal costs increase with the communication
costs between a foreign plant and the headquarters of a multinational firm. Foreign sales
and the probability of foreign entry correspondingly decrease with the communication
costs, that are correlated with geographic distance. The organization of knowledge thus
helps understand distinct features of multinational firms' behavior that have hitherto been
analyzed separately in the literature.
It is difficult to test the model predictions of the organization of knowledge as know-
ledge is intangible and typically proprietary. Knowledge flows within multinational firms
are very hard to observe. To overcome this problem, I use unique data on the flows
of corporate transferees between countries. The data are ideally suited to testing the
model because multinationals use corporate transferees predominantly to transfer know-
how (e.g., Djanani, L¨
osel, and L¨
osel, 2003). To the best of my knowledge, I am the first to
exploit corporate transferees as a visible reflection of firms' organization of knowledge. I
find that the proportion of corporate transferees in the employment of multinationals sys-
tematically increases with the communication costs between two countries, as measured
by the overlap in office hours, linguistic proximity, communication technology and flight
2The pattern is often called the "gravity of FDI", see, e.g., Irarrazabal, Moxnes, and Opromolla (2013),
Keller and Yeaple (2013).

time. This finding is consistent with the prediction that the optimal level of knowledge
at a foreign plant increases with the communication costs with the headquarters.
Using firm-level data for German multinational firms, I provide evidence consistent
with the interdependence of marginal costs of multinational firms across countries. Fur-
thermore, I confirm the implications of the model for the geography of multinationals' sales
and investments. In line with the model predictions, German multinationals have higher
sales in countries that are characterized by lower communication costs with Germany,
even after controlling for firm heterogeneity. The findings hold for regressions including
geographic distance and other trade cost measures, and are robust to adding further deter-
minants of foreign sales, e.g., the quality of the investment climate. Sector-level analyses
of the choice between exporting and FDI confirm that higher communication costs dis-
courage foreign investment: The ratio of aggregate affiliate sales to aggregate exports in a
sector and foreign country decreases with higher communication costs between Germany
and the foreign country, and increases with higher trade costs. The predictions for wages
are not testable due to the lack of appropriate data.
The paper contributes to several strands of literature. First, the paper adds to the
literature on firms as knowledge hierarchies (Garicano, 2000; for a survey, see alsoGaricano
and Rossi-Hansberg, forthcoming).3 Within this literature, the paper is closest to that of
Antr`
as et al. (2006), who study the formation of cross-country teams, a form of vertical
FDI, and to the work on the organization of exporters by Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg
(2012) and Caliendo et al. (forthcoming). To the best of my knowledge, this paper is the
first to study heterogeneity in the communication costs within firms and show that this
heterogeneity can be useful to understand the specific features of the behavior of firms
with several plants.
Second, the paper provides new insights into the emergence of multinational firm wage
premiums (for surveys of the empirical evidence, see Harrison and Rodr´
iguez-Clare, 2010;
Malchow-Møller, Markusen, and Schjerning, 2013).4 By focusing on the particular fea-
tures of the organization of knowledge, the paper proposes an explanation that is specific
to multinational firms and distinct from the scale-related arguments used to explain ex-
porter wage premiums.5 Previous theories on residual MNE wage premiums build on fair
3For related work on information processing in organizations, see Radner (1993); Bolton and Dewa-
tripont (1994).
4Many papers document that affiliates of multinational firms pay higher wages than domestic firms.
The wage premium decreases, but remains significant if regressions control for firm and industry charac-
teristics, and account for the endogeneity of foreign take-overs. It tends to be higher in developing than
in developed countries (e.g., Aitken et al., 1996; Hijzen, Martins, Schank, and Upward, 2013). Although
worker heterogeneity accounts for part of the variation, it does not fully explain the multinational wage
premium (Malchow-Møller et al., 2013). Likewise, multinational parent companies pay higher wages than
domestic firms (Heyman, Sj¨
oholm, and Tingvall, 2007).
5In particular, the mechanism differs from that of Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012), who show
4
wage preferences (Egger and Kreickemeier, 2013).
Third, the paper contributes to the literature on the role of headquarter inputs for local
affiliate production (Keller and Yeaple, 2013; Irarrazabal et al., 2013). Previous papers
in this literature focus on the geography of FDI and extend the framework in Helpman
et al. (2004) to incorporate productivity-shifting mechanisms.6 This paper is distinct in
modeling the organization of multinational firms. It introduces a novel angle to the study
of multinational firms as it endogenously determines how firms adjust the characteristics
of their headquarters to their mode of internationalization.7 The paper thus provides a
coherent rationale for both the geography of FDI and MNE wage premiums.
Fourth, the paper adds a theoretical perspective to a series of predominantly empiri-
cal papers showing that communication costs inhibit investments by multinational firms
(Bahar, 2014; Cristea, forthcoming; Defever, 2012; Oldenski, 2012).8
Finally, the paper contributes to the literature on the spatial diffusion of knowledge
(for a comprehensive survey, see Keller, 2004). Investments by multinational firms are
an important channel of international knowledge diffusion.9 The paper highlights that
spatial communication frictions have a substantial impact on multinational firms. Conse-
quently, investment promotion policies should not only improve the business climate inside
a country, but also reduce communication costs with source countries of FDI. Improving
language training, investing in the communication infrastructure and other targeted mea-
sures to facilitate bilateral communication may prove useful in attracting FDI and thus
bringing new technologies to a country.
The following section develops the model of the organization of knowledge and consti-
tutes the core of the paper. Section 3 derives the model implications for multinationals'
that increased demand after trade liberalization leads to adjustments in the organization of knowledge
that explain why exporter wage premiums may emerge. The exporter wage premium is thus based on
size, whereas the multinational wage premium proposed here results because several plants share common
headquarters.
6In Keller and Yeaple (2013), firms can either produce intermediaries locally but subject to efficiency
losses due to sector-specific communication frictions with the headquarters, or import intermediaries from
home, subject to transport costs. Irarrazabal et al. (2013) assume that headquarter inputs are required
in the production process of affiliates, but decay due to iceberg-type transport costs. In both papers,
the marginal costs of production are independent across countries and do not vary with the production
quantity.
7Earlier papers assume that headquarter services are public goods, i.e., foreign affiliates can use
them without additional investment (e.g., Helpman et al., 2004; Keller and Yeaple, 2013; Irarrazabal
et al., 2013), or study the impact of constraints to the managerial capacity or span of control (e.g.,
Ramondo, 2014; Yeaple, 2013). Ethier and Horn (1990) study adjustments to managerial capacity, but
in a monitoring hierarchy.
8Fort (2014) studies the impact of communication technology on the fragmentation of production
processes.
9Take-overs of domestic firms by multinational firms cause productivity increases in take-over targets
through restructuring and the introduction of new technologies (Arnold and Javorcik, 2009). Knowledge
spillovers lead to productivity gains for multinationals' suppliers and customers (Harrison and Rodr´
iguez-
Clare, 2010).

sales and the probability of investment, as well as their wage setting behavior. Sec-
tion 4 describes why data on corporate transferees provide evidence on the organization
of knowledge in multinational firms and presents the regression results. Section 5 con-
tains the empirical evidence concerning the geography of multinational firms' sales, and
explains how the analyses allow discrimination between a knowledge based mechanism
and a monitoring model. The last section concludes.
2 The optimal organization of knowledge
2.1 Set up
The model economy consists of two countries, the home country j = 0 and the foreign
country j = 1. The countries are populated by Nj
agents each endowed with one unit
of time. The analysis abstracts from capital market and contractual imperfections for
clarity.10
Establishing firms. Agents choose between supplying their time in the labor market
and being entrepreneurs. An entrepreneur in the home country hires f units of labor in
the domestic labor market to pay the entry cost and establish a firm. The entry cost is
thereafter sunk. Upon paying the entry cost, each entrepreneur receives the blueprint of
a differentiated product, a level of knowledge ¯
zi
and the option to establish a corporate
headquarters. The knowledge level ¯
zi
corresponds to the state of a firm's technology.
Mathematically, knowledge is an interval ranging from zero to a firm-specific upper bound
¯
Zi
. ¯
zi
denotes the length of a knowledge interval [0, ¯
Zi
] (i.e., its Lebesgue measure).
Knowledge levels ¯
zi
follow a known distribution G(¯
z), which is symmetric in the two
countries. Given ¯
zi
, the entrepreneur decides whether to establish headquarters and
produce, or instead to provide his time in the labor market.
If the entrepreneur decides to set up a corporate headquarters and produce, he spends
his unit of time providing leadership services in the headquarters. He decides whether
to sell in the domestic country, the foreign country, or both, and whether to set up a
production plant at home, in the foreign country, or in both countries. He hires em-
ployees in the headquarters and the production plant(s) and determines the organization
of knowledge. These activities capture non-rival headquarter services similar to those
in Markusen (1984) and the subsequent MNE literature. The entrepreneur receives the
market wage as well as profits.11
10Fuchs, Garicano, and Rayo (forthcoming) is an example of recent work on the emergence of hierar-
chical structures similar to the knowledge hierarchies studied in this paper in a contracting framework.
11The entrepreneur receives the market wage because his outside option is to supply time to the labor
6
To study the differences between the optimal organization of knowledge of domestic
and multinational firms in a transparent manner, I restrict the parameter space so the
entrepreneur always finds it optimal to hire employees in the headquarters and the pro-
duction plant(s) (see Appendix A). All firms thus consist of employees in the headquarters
and at least one production plant. The nh
employees hired in the headquarters are called
managers and the nj
employees working in the production plant(s) are called workers.12
The term "multinational firm (MNE)" refers to any firm with a foreign production plant.
To simplify the exposition, section 2 focuses on a single firm established to produce output
using the knowledge level ¯
z. Section 3 extends the analysis to many firms indexed by i
with heterogeneous knowledge levels ¯
zi
.
Producing output. Production is a problem solving process based on labor and know-
ledge (as in Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg, 2012; Garicano, 2000). For each unit of labor
employed in production, problems are realized with a mass 1. Transforming labor into
output requires that the problems be solved. An agent solves a problem if it is realized
within his knowledge interval. The problems are distributed according to an exponential
probability distribution function:
f(z) = e-z
where z  [0, ) refers to the domain of possible problems and  > 0 denotes the problem
arrival rate. A higher value of  implies that the mass of the probability distribution is
concentrated close to zero. Intuitively, this means that the production process is more
predictable as problems in the tail of the probability distribution occur with lower prob-
ability, so more output can be produced with a given amount of labor and knowledge.
The output qj
of nj
units of labor input with knowledge ¯
z can be calculated as nj
times the value of the cumulative distribution function:
qj
= nj
(1 - e-¯
z).
Learning and communicating. The firm's knowledge ¯
z is only useful if its employees
learn it. The underlying idea is that employees have to know how to employ production
technologies to use them fruitfully. The knowledge can be learned by workers or man-
agers.13 Learning knowledge is costly: Employees have to hire teachers to train them.
market.
12Managers are hired only at the headquarters. This assumption can be micro-founded by assuming
that the entrepreneur provides a moderation service in the headquarters that decreases the communication
costs between the headquarters and the plants below the level of communication costs that prevails in the
economy. Alternatively, unit constraints at the managerial level provide a micro-foundation for domestic
management.
13The entrepreneur's time is fully used to provide leadership services.

Teachers have to spend cj

ation wj

zk
. The entrepreneur remunerates his employees for the time they spend in
production and for their learning expenses (as in Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg, 2012).14
The workers and the managers can communicate and leverage the potentially different
knowledge levels. Communication is costly. As is standard in the literature (e.g., Bolton
and Dewatripont, 1994; Garicano, 2000), the receiver of a message bears the communi-
cation costs: he has to spend time listening. The communication costs, i.e., the amount
of time that the receiver spends listening, depends on whether the sender is located in
the same or another country. The receiver in country j spends kj
 0 units of time
listening to senders in country k. The assumption that 10
> 00
and 11
= 00
, 01
= 10
captures the fact that there are frictions in cross-border communication compared to
communication within a country.
Organizing knowledge. The entrepreneur designs the optimal organization of know-
ledge, i.e., he decides which part of the firm's knowledge is learned by the workers and
which part is learned by the managers. Analogous to the results for firms with a single
production plant in Garicano (2000), only workers supply labor and managers use their
time solely for communication because this specialization makes it possible to achieve
the optimal utilization rate of costly knowledge. The production process thus works as
follows. During each unit of time that they spend in production, the workers immedi-
ately solve the problems realized in their knowledge interval and produce output. The
workers communicate all problems that are not covered by their knowledge interval to
the managers. The managers solve all problems covered by their knowledge interval. Any
problems that are not covered by the knowledge intervals of either the workers or the
managers remain unsolved.15
Both workers and managers are optimally characterized by knowledge levels that are
uniform within each group and different between the two groups. Uniform knowledge
14I follow Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012) as their approach allows a straightforward general
equilibrium analysis. The results of my paper do not depend on these specific assumptions. They merely
require that the entrepreneur remunerates the employees for the learning of knowledge. One could
alternatively assume that there are multiple time periods and that firms have to hire and remunerate
employees during a training period. Very low search costs then suffice to ensure that firms find it optimal
to pay trained employees higher wages.
15The model describes production processes in which workers execute routine tasks, and consult an
expert if non-routine problems arise. For example, manufacturing firms teach workers the common
functionalities of machines, but employ experts for exceptional applications. In service firms, counter
personnel deals with common requests of clients, and refers them to specialists for particular needs. As
Garicano and Hubbard (2007) show, the framework describes how law firms split tasks between associates
and lawyers.
8
levels reduce communication time by diminishing the time spent searching for a competent
contact. Workers know that only managers may know solutions to problems that they
themselves cannot solve, and that it does not matter which manager they approach. To
minimize the probability that costly communication is necessary, the knowledge level of
workers covers the solutions to more frequently occurring problems, whereas managers
know the solutions to problems that occur more rarely (Garicano, 2000). The knowledge
interval of workers correspondingly starts at 0, where the mass of the problem density is
highest, and ranges to an endogenous country specific upper bound Zj
, j = 0, 1. zj
denotes
the length of the knowledge interval of workers [0, Zj
]. The managers learn to solve
infrequent problems. Under the parameter restrictions imposed above (see Appendix A), it
is never optimal that the employees do not learn part of the firm's knowledge interval [0, ¯
Z].
More knowledge enables the firm to produce more output with a given amount of labor
input and thus decreases marginal costs. The upper bound of managerial knowledge and
the upper bound of the knowledge interval of the firm coincide. The knowledge interval
of managers ranges from a lower bound Zh
to ¯
Z. zh
denotes the length of this interval
[Zh
, ¯
Z].16 The entrepreneur chooses the knowledge levels zj
and zh
as well as the number of

and managers nh

and zh
, the firm determines the upper bound
of the workers' knowledge interval(s) Zj

2.2 The optimization problem
The entrepreneur chooses the optimal organization of knowledge to minimize the pro-
duction costs. The costs consist of the cost for personnel at the production plant(s) and
at the headquarters, as well as the entrepreneurial wage. Each employee is remunerated
with the market wage wj
per unit of time spent working for the firm and for the learning
expenses wj
cj
zk
, k = h, j.
The cost minimization problem applies to a firm with production plants in the home
and the foreign country, and comprises a firm with only a domestic or a foreign plant as
special cases. The entrepreneur optimally chooses the number of workers {nj
}1
j=0
, their
country specific knowledge level {zj
}1
j=0
, the number of managers nh
, and the managerial
knowledge level zh
.

The production quantities {qj

they are endogenized in subsection 3.1. Wages {wj

are endogenized in subsection 3.2.
The problem arrival rate , communication costs {j0

j=0
, and learning costs {cj

are
positive exogenous parameters determined by the predictability of the production process
and the geography and institutions of a country.
When choosing {nj
}1
j=0
, nh
, {zj
}1
j=0
and zh
, the entrepreneur faces four types of con-
straints:
Eq. (2): The firm has to produce a total output nj
(1 - e-¯
z) of at least qj
units.
Eq. (3): The managers or the workers have to learn the firm's knowledge. This is
ensured if the workers' knowledge level zj
and the managers' knowledge level
zh
add up to at least the knowledge level of the firm ¯
z.
Eq. (4): The entrepreneur has to hire a sufficient number of managers such that the
managers are able to listen to all problems brought to them. The number of
problems sent by each plant is calculated as the mass of problems generated
through labor input nj
times the probability that the solution is not found by
the workers in j, e-zj . This term is multiplied by the communication costs
j0
.
Eq. (5, 6): All choice variables are restricted to be positive. Employees' knowledge cannot
exceed the total knowledge of the firm.
Equation (3) indicates that overlaps between managerial knowledge and the knowledge
of workers may occur. This is specific to MNEs with production plants in the home and the
foreign country. In a setting with only one plant, overlaps cannot be optimal: The overlap
of managerial knowledge and workers' knowledge increases costs, but remains unused at
the headquarters (Garicano, 2000). If the firm has two plants, overlaps between the
knowledge at one plant and managerial knowledge may occur as long as the overlapping
managerial knowledge is used to solve problems communicated by the workers from the
other plant.17
17In principle, gaps between managerial knowledge and the knowledge of workers may also occur.
Knowledge gaps render the analysis analytically less tractable, so they are treated in Appendix B.4.

country characteristics. The knowledge constraint (3) is binding for at least one country:

If the knowledge constraint is non-binding for both countries, the overlap of managerial
knowledge and workers' knowledge remains unused. This cannot be optimal.

The knowledge constraint is, ceteris paribus, more likely to be binding in the home country
due to the lower communication costs, and in the country with higher wages and learning
costs.20
Only firms with a sufficiently high knowledge level ¯
z choose asymmetric knowledge
levels of workers. The savings due to less frequent communication with the headquarters
have to outweigh the cost increase due to higher worker knowledge levels. This is more
likely for higher ¯
z, because managerial knowledge increases with ¯
z (see subsection 2.3).
More asymmetric country characteristics also render asymmetric knowledge levels more
likely (see Appendix B.1).

workers is omitted from equations (10) and (11), as are domestic wages from equation (10).
A comparison of equations (9), (10) and (11) shows that the optimal organization of
knowledge systematically differs between firms with one and two production plants. The
knowledge levels of managers and workers in a firm with one production plant depend
only on variables that are exogenous to the firm. They are independent of the production
quantity. In contrast, a firm with two production plants additionally takes the production
quantity into account in allocating knowledge. As is shown in subsection 3.1, the firm
organizes in such a way that results in greater cost reduction for a plant the larger its
output.

Proof. See Appendix B.2.
The optimal organization of knowledge varies with the characteristics of the home and
foreign countries. The firm may have a production plant in the home country, or in the
foreign country, or plants in both countries. In this case, the knowledge constraint may
be binding at both plants, or binding at one and slack at the other plant. The country
characteristics usually have similar effects on the organization of knowledge of the firm in
the different cases.
Most importantly, higher communication costs j0
always increase the knowledge level
of workers zj
to reduce the number of problems that need to be communicated to the
headquarters.21 Managerial knowledge zh
decreases in the communication costs if the
knowledge constraint zj
= ¯
z - zh
is binding, and is independent of the communication
costs if it is slack.
Higher learning costs cj
increase the remuneration for every single worker, so it is
optimal to reduce the knowledge they hold to mitigate cost increases. Correspondingly,
managerial knowledge increases in the learning costs, except if the knowledge constraint
is not binding. This result may seem counterintuitive at first. If the knowledge level of
workers decreases, the number of problems sent to headquarters increases. This entails
21This prediction is consistent with empirical findings in Bloom, Sadun, and Van Reenen (2012) who
show, using survey data, that plant managers have fewer responsibilities if the CEO is on site than if he
is off site.
14
an incentive to reduce the marginal costs of using the headquarters w0
(1 + c0
zh
), which is
achieved by decreasing managerial knowledge. This is possible as the knowledge constraint
is not binding. Analogously, higher wages wj
decrease the knowledge level of workers and
affect managerial knowledge in MNEs.22
If a larger quantity qj
is to be produced, more workers need to be hired, each of
whom receives wj
(1 + cj
zj
). A firm with two production plants can mitigate this cost
increase by adjusting the optimal organization of knowledge within its organization.23 The
production quantity does not affect the workers' optimal knowledge level for firms with
only one production plant. An increase in the production quantity leads to a proportional
increase in the number of workers, which in turn causes a proportional increase in the
number of managers. Similarly, wages scale the total costs of production for a firm with
only a domestic production plant. The effect of learning costs and communication costs
is different. The entrepreneur faces a trade-off also if he produces at a single location:
Assigning more knowledge to the workers increases the costs at the production plant, but
decreases the costs that accrue due to communication between workers and managers.24
The knowledge level of the workers and the knowledge level of managers both increase
with the total knowledge of the firm ¯
z. The problem arrival rate  has an ambiguous
effect on the knowledge level of workers and managers. A higher value of  decreases the
probability that the workers do not find the solution to a problem for a given value of zj
.
This sets an incentive to reduce workers' knowledge to save costs. At the same time, a
higher value of  implies that the number of managers responds more strongly to changes
in zj
. More managers need to be hired if zj
is decreased, which dampens the negative
effect of  on zj
.
Taking the first order conditions for managerial knowledge (9), (10), and (11), and
the comparative statics together reveals that the optimal level of managerial knowledge
in MNEs is systematically different from the optimal managerial knowledge in domestic
firms.
Proposition 2. Multinational firms systematically choose lower levels of managerial
knowledge than domestic firms if 00
w1
c1
< 10
w0
c0
.
22If the knowledge constraint is binding at both plants, the comparative statics only apply to foreign
workers' knowledge. Managerial knowledge decreases in domestic wages. The domestic workers' know-
ledge level thus increases. The domestic learning costs have an ambiguous effect on managerial and
domestic workers' knowledge.
23MNEs with asymmetric worker knowledge levels always decrease the workers' knowledge zj
when qj
increases. MNEs with symmetric knowledge levels decrease the workers' knowledge if zj
is the country
with the higher ratio of wj cj
j0
and increase it otherwise. They thereby reorganize towards asymmetric
workers' knowledge.
24The results for domestic firms match the results for single-establishment firms in Bloom, Garicano,
Sadun, and Van Reenen (2014).
15
Proof. See Appendix B.3.
Intuitively, MNEs choose a lower level of managerial knowledge than domestic firms
to ensure an efficient utilization rate of knowledge. Workers in foreign plants have higher
levels of knowledge than if they were employed in a domestic plant because of the higher
cross-border communication costs. They thus turn to headquarters for help less frequently
than workers in domestic firms. This decreases the utilization rate of managerial know-
ledge. At the same time, managerial knowledge is equally costly for domestic firms and
MNEs. MNEs consequently decrease the amount of managerial knowledge to balance its
utilization rate and its costs.25
In summary, section 2 shows that the optimal organization of knowledge in firms differs
with the firm's multinational status. MNEs assign systematically higher levels of know-
ledge to their workers and systematically lower levels of knowledge to their headquarters
to avoid the higher communication costs with the foreign market. MNEs with two pro-
duction plants may choose asymmetric knowledge levels for their domestic and foreign
workers. Their organization of knowledge depends on the foreign and domestic produc-
tion quantities, whereas the production quantity does not influence the organization of
knowledge in single-plant firms.
3 The implications for MNEs' foreign sales and wages
3.1 The self-selection of firms into foreign investment
The analysis of the choice between domestic activity, exporting, and FDI focuses on a
firm in the home country j = 0, and analogously applies to firms in the foreign country
j = 1. There are many monopolistically competing firms in both countries (similar to
Helpman et al., 2004). Each firm i produces a distinct variety and is characterized by its
firm-specific knowledge ¯
zi
.
Consumers have symmetric CES preferences:

where j

25As will become clearer below, the parameter restriction 00

c1
< 10

is likely to hold for the
majority of foreign investments: Foreign investment is only worthwhile if foreign wages and learning costs
are sufficiently low to outweigh the comparatively high communication costs between the foreign plant
and the headquarters.
16
of substitution and xj
(¯
zi
) is the individual consumption level in country j of the variety
produced by firm i with knowledge input ¯
zi
. The set of varieties i
, the mass of firms Mj
and the density of their knowledge levels µ(¯
z) are determined in general equilibrium in
the next subsection.
The total demand is given by the population Nj
multiplied by the individual demands:
qj
(¯

) = Nj
xj
(¯

Each entrepreneur chooses the location(s) of the production plant(s) and the produc-
tion quantities to maximize profits. The location decision affects the optimal organization
of knowledge, so each choice is associated with distinct endogenous marginal production
costs. Each option entails fixed costs in units of domestic labor. Firms can sell their
output in the home country at fixed costs fD ("domestic firms"). With additional fixed
costs fX, "exporters" ship output to the foreign country. Alternatively, the entrepreneur
can establish a foreign production plant solely to sell output abroad at fixed costs fI, and,
for additional fixed costs of fV , export output back to the home country. Such firms are
called "vertical MNEs" what follows. To ship output from country k to country j = k,
the firm incurs iceberg transport costs  > 1.26 "Horizontal MNEs" serve consumers from
two local production plants at fixed costs fD + fI.
I assume that fI > -1fX > Q1P-1

fD and fV < 1- Q0

fI. It is thus never
optimal to export but not to serve the domestic market, or to establish only a foreign
production plant and not export back home.
The entrepreneur first determines the optimal production quantities and then chooses
the location(s) of the production plant(s) associated with the maximum resulting profits.
In what follows, optimal quantities are characterized by the mode, using the superscripts
D for domestic firms, X for exporters, V for vertical MNEs, and I for horizontal MNEs.27

The optimal production quantity of a domestic firm is determined by similar consid-
erations.
Optimal quantities vary by mode. As is well-known, an exporter or vertical MNE sells
larger quantities in the country with the production plant than in the country served via
trade by  > 1,  > 1, so concentrating production in one location is more profitable the
lower the transport costs .
Quantities sold domestically by a horizontal MNE are lower than domestically sold
quantities would be if the firm produced only domestically:
qD
0
(¯
zi
) = qX
0
(¯
zi
)  qI
0
(¯
zi
). (21)
This result arises because the entrepreneur cannot tailor the headquarters of a horizontal
MNE to domestic needs. Correspondingly, domestic profits are lower in the case of FDI
than in the case of exporting or domestic activity. Analogously, quantities sold in the
foreign market are higher if the firm conducts vertical FDI than if it conducts horizontal
18
FDI:
qV
1
(¯
zi
)  qI
1
(¯
zi
). (22)
The higher fixed costs and the sales foregone with two production plants are only
worthwhile if the quantities sold in the second country exceed the quantities that could
be sold via trade:
qI
1
(¯
zi
) > qX
1
(¯
zi
); qI
0
(¯
zi
) > qV
0
(¯
zi
), (23)
i.e., if foreign production quantities in case of horizontal FDI exceed foreign export quan-
tities, and domestic production quantities in case of horizontal FDI exceed domestic reim-
ports.
Optimal quantities also vary with country characteristics.
Proposition 3. The foreign marginal costs 1
(¯
zi
, w0
, w1
) of vertical MNEs increase with
the communication costs 10
, the foreign wages w1
, and the foreign learning costs c1
.
Consequently, foreign production quantities and sales are higher in countries with lower
communication costs 10
, lower wages w1
and lower learning costs c1
.
Proof. See Appendix C.1.
As equation (19) shows, the optimal foreign production quantity of a vertical MNE
varies negatively with the foreign marginal costs. The foreign marginal costs increase
with the communication costs 10
, the foreign learning costs c1
, and the wages w1
, so the
foreign quantity decreases with these country characteristics.
Proposition 4. The foreign marginal costs 1
(¯
zi
, qI
0
(¯
zi
), w0
, qI
1
(¯
zi
), w1
) of horizontal MNEs
increase with the communication costs 10
. They decrease with the foreign production
quantity qI
1
(¯
zi
) and increase with the domestic production quantity qI
0
(¯
zi
). Analogously,
domestic marginal costs 0
(¯
zi
, qI
0
(¯
zi
), w0
, qI
1
(¯
zi
), w1
) decrease with the domestic production
quantity qI
0
(¯
zi
) and increase with the foreign production quantity qI
1
(¯
zi
). Consequently,
the foreign production quantities and sales are generally higher in countries with lower
communication costs 10
.
Proof. See Appendix C.2.
Examining equation (16) indicates that the optimal production quantities of horizontal
MNEs vary negatively with the marginal costs of production. However, the relationship
between foreign country characteristics and the optimal production quantities is more
complex than in the case of vertical MNEs. The marginal costs depend on the domestic
and foreign production quantities due to their influence on the optimal organization of
knowledge.
19
A horizontal MNE chooses the optimal organization of knowledge in such a way that
favors plants with larger output: the larger the output of a plant j, the lower the marginal
costs j
at the expense of higher marginal costs k
, k = j. The foreign country charac-
teristics thus have a direct and an indirect effect on the production quantities. Higher
communication costs increase the foreign marginal costs of production. This exerts a
direct negative effect on foreign output. As the output affects the optimal organization of
knowledge, higher communication costs also have an indirect positive effect on the foreign
marginal costs of production. The entrepreneur adjusts the organization of knowledge
due to the lower foreign production quantity, so the foreign marginal costs increase even
further, depressing foreign output and foreign sales.28
It is more difficult to determine the impact of the foreign learning costs and wages on
the optimal foreign production quantities of horizontal MNEs because it is not possible
to determine their effect on the foreign marginal costs of production in an unambiguous
manner. Foreign wages w1
and learning costs c1
have a positive direct effect on the
foreign marginal costs of production, but changes in wages and learning costs also affect
the organization of knowledge. These adjustments work against the direct positive effect,
i.e., they decrease the marginal costs.29 The total effect of foreign wages and learning
costs on the marginal costs is thus analytically ambiguous.
Communication frictions between two countries arise due to foreign languages, time
zone differences, or weak communication infrastructure. Some of these factors are cor-
related with the geographic distance between two countries. The negative effect of the
communication costs between the home and the foreign country on the foreign sales thus
provides a novel explanation for the stylized fact that MNEs' foreign sales decrease with
the distance between the foreign country and the home country of the MNE (e.g., Antr`
as
and Yeaple, 2014, Sec. 2).
Investment decision. Given the optimal production quantities, the entrepreneur chooses
the production mode (D, X, V , I) with the maximum total net profits.
The different production modes affect the organization of knowledge and thus the
marginal production costs. In particular, horizontal FDI leads to the reorganization of
knowledge in the firm compared to the case with only one production plant. Unlike
previous models of horizontal FDI (e.g., Helpman et al., 2004), the marginal production
costs are interdependent across countries. Domestic (or, in the case of vertical FDI,
foreign) marginal costs are affected by the decision to set up a second plant, so total net

profits--domestic and foreign net profits--with two plants have to exceed the total net
profits of exporting or producing only abroad.
The choice between exporting and purely domestic activity only depends on whether
the foreign variable export profits exceed the fixed costs of exporting. The firm produces
additional output without adjusting its organization, so domestic profits are not affected.
3.2 Aggregate exports and foreign sales
The general equilibrium analysis determines how MNEs' organization of knowledge affects
the aggregate foreign investment flows between countries. For simplicity, I assume that
the foreign and the domestic country are symmetric with respect to the learning costs
c1
= c0
= c and the population N1
= N0
= N. This implies that equilibrium outcomes
are symmetric in both countries. Serving both countries using a foreign production plant
cannot be optimal as the positive effect of communication costs on marginal costs is not
outweighed by differences in the other country characteristics. Firms either sell their
product only domestically, or export it to the foreign market, or conduct horizontal FDI,
and have to incur the fixed costs associated with each of these options. fD, fX and fI
are such that domestic firms, exporters and foreign investors co-exist. As indicated at the
beginning of the theory section, each entrepreneur draws the blueprint of a differentiated
product and a firm-specific knowledge level ¯
zi
upon paying the sunk entry costs f. The
knowledge levels follow a known distribution G(¯
z) that is defined for an interval [¯
zmin
, ¯
zmax
]
determined by the parameter restriction in Appendix A.
The general equilibrium conditions determine the symmetric cut-off knowledge levels
for activity ¯
z, for exporting ¯
zX, and for FDI ¯
zI, the mass of firms M, wages w, and total
income Q. The domestic price index is normalized to unity, so the foreign price index is
equal to one: P1
= P0
= 1. The parameters , c, kj
and N are exogenous. Appendix C.3
contains the proofs.
The question of interest is how the frictions in cross-border communication affect
the aggregate export and foreign investment flows. Three zero-cut-off profit conditions
describe how firms self-select into the different options, based on the results of subsec-
tion 3.1. The least productive active firm is indifferent between producing domestically
and remaining inactive: its variable profits are equal to the fixed costs of production fD.
The first zero cut-off profit condition determines the knowledge level ¯
z of the marginal
entrant as a function of wages w.

The marginal MNE is indifferent between exporting and FDI. The net total export profits

Inspection of the zero-cut-off profit conditions shows that MNEs have a higher know-
ledge level ¯

than exporters, which in turn are more knowledgeable than domestic firms:

so exporters have lower marginal production costs than domestic firms, as in Melitz (2003).
As the marginal costs 0

, ¯
zX > ¯
z results. Taking wages
as given, an increase in  implies that the exporting cut-off knowledge level ¯
zX increases:
It is profitable to export to more distant destinations only for firms with lower marginal
costs.
¯
zI > ¯
zX results because the fixed costs of FDI are higher than the fixed costs of
exporting by a factor of more than -1, so firms have to have a higher knowledge level to
carry out FDI profitably. Domestic profits decrease in the case of FDI as the headquarters
are no longer tailored to domestic needs but balance domestic and foreign requirements.
Compared to a model with independent marginal costs of production, the marginal costs
cut-off is thus shifted downwards.
Given wages, the knowledge cut-off ¯
zI increases with the communication costs 10
between the host country and the MNE's home country, and decreases with the trans-
portation costs  between the home and the host country because export profits decrease
with  and profits from FDI decrease with 10
.
To determine the other equilibrium variables, it is necessary to consider the remaining

The labor market clearing condition determines the number of firms M. Labor is
used to cover the sunk cost of entry, the fixed costs of production, exporting and FDI,
and the demands for labor in production, management, and teaching. Labor demand for

By symmetry, the trade balance condition is fulfilled.
Inspection of the free entry condition shows that the parameters have an additional ef-
fect on the export and FDI knowledge cut-offs through wages. Equilibrium wages decrease
with higher transport costs  and communication costs 10
, because they decrease the net
value of entry. The decrease in wages dampens the increase in the export knowledge cut-
off with transport costs and the increase of the FDI cut-off with communication costs. It
amplifies the negative effect of higher transport costs on the FDI cut-off, and leads to a
decrease in the export cut-off with higher communication costs. In sum, the export know-
ledge cut-off thus increases with transport costs and decreases with the communication
30The free entry condition assumes a unique cut-off knowledge level for FDI. As both the export and
FDI profits are strictly increasing and concave in ¯
z, several cut-offs may exist. The results hold, but are
less tractable.

costs, and the minimum knowledge level required for foreign investment decreases with
the transport costs and increases with the communication costs. MNEs' aggregate foreign
sales thus increase relative to aggregate exports if the transport costs rise, and decrease
with higher communication costs.
3.3 Multinational wage premiums
In addition to the results for the geography of MNEs' investments, the model provides
novel insights into MNE wage premiums. Consistent with empirical evidence (e.g., Harri-
son and Rodr´
iguez-Clare, 2010; Heyman et al., 2007), MNEs are predicted to pay higher
remuneration to workers than non-MNEs both in the home and the foreign countries.32
The wage premiums arise via two different channels: due to firm organization and due to
a selection effect.
Firm organization provides a new and MNE-specific explanation for residual MNE
wage premiums, i.e., for wage premiums paid by MNEs compared to non-MNEs with
the same observable characteristics such as sales. As outlined in section 2, MNEs choose
an organization of knowledge with higher levels of worker knowledge than if they were
non-MNEs. The higher communication costs involved in foreign production increase the
optimal level of knowledge at their foreign plant. MNEs therefore decrease managerial
knowledge to balance the utilization rate and costs, and increase the knowledge level of
their domestic workers.
Empirical studies typically compare MNEs and non-MNEs with the same observable
characteristics. As the marginal costs decrease with total firm knowledge, a non-MNE
with the same marginal costs as an MNE has lower knowledge ¯
z than the MNE. This
reinforces the difference in workers' knowledge levels. Thus, MNEs pay higher remunera-
tion to workers than non-MNEs with the same marginal costs of production and the same
sales.
Proposition 5 summarizes the results.
Proposition 5. Vertical MNEs pay higher remuneration to foreign workers than non-
MNEs in the foreign country with the same marginal costs and foreign sales. Horizontal
MNEs pay higher remuneration to domestic workers than non-MNEs in the home coun-
try with the same marginal costs and domestic sales if 00

and c1
 c0
. The parameter
restrictions are sufficient, but not necessary conditions.
32The model abstracts from contractual imperfections, which are relevant in understanding the evolu-
tion of managerial wages (e.g., Marin, Schymik, and Tarasov, 2014). This section therefore focuses on
predictions for workers' remuneration.
24
Proof. Follows from Proposition 2, see also Appendix B.3.
Inspection of the parameter restriction 00

c0
shows that the model pre-
dicts residual MNE wage premiums both for developed to developed and developed
to developing country FDI. Foreign wages and learning costs must not exceed domes-
tic wages and learning costs by more than the friction in cross-border communication:
w1
c1
< 10
00
w0
c0
. This includes the case w0
c0
 w1
c1
, which is likely to apply to FDI from
developed countries to other developed countries. Learning costs are likely to be higher in
developing than in developed countries, for example due to lower literacy rates. Market
wages are typically much lower. Wage premiums occur whenever the difference in market
wages outweighs the difference in learning costs. Higher communication frictions increase
the likelihood that this is the case. The wage premium in the foreign country is higher
the greater c1
is. Consistent with the empirical evidence (e.g., Aitken et al., 1996; Hijzen
et al., 2013), MNE wage premiums are thus predicted to be stronger for developing than
for developed countries. As the communication costs and relative wages and learning
costs are heterogeneous across countries, the model explains why wage premiums vary
with the nationality of the acquirer, as found in Girma and G¨
org (2007).
The organization of knowledge is an MNE-specific explanation of MNE wage pre-
miums. The mechanism is reminiscent of but different from that of Caliendo and Rossi-
Hansberg (2012), who study exporter-wage premiums using a knowledge-hierarchy model.
In their framework, firms reorganize after an increase in output due to trade liberalization.
In contrast, the residual MNE wage premium stems from an organizational friction--
domestic headquarters for potentially multiple production plants--that is characteristic
of MNEs.
In addition, the model features MNE wage premiums due to the self-selection of firms
into FDI. Only firms with a higher knowledge level ¯
z become MNEs.33 These firms pay
on average higher wages than non-MNEs to managers and workers, both in their home
country and the foreign country, due to the positive effect of ¯
z on zh
, z0
and z1
(see
Proposition 1). This wage premium does not stem from multinationality per se, but
from a firm characteristic--knowledge--that favors FDI and leads to higher wages. The
channel is similar to explanations that attribute MNE wage premiums to differences in
firm characteristics between MNEs and non-MNEs, such as differences in labor demand
volatility or closure rates (see the survey in Malchow-Møller et al., 2013).
33Only higher ¯
z firms select into vertical FDI whenever V

4 Corporate transferees and the organization of know-
ledge
Proposition 1 describes how the optimal organization of knowledge in MNEs varies with
the communication costs between a plant and the headquarters, as well as country and
firm characteristics. Its predictions are very difficult to test: Knowledge is intangible in
nature, and typically proprietary. Within-MNE knowledge flows are thus very hard to
observe.
To overcome this problem, I use unique and novel information on the flows of corporate
transferees between pairs of countries. Corporate transferees are employees who MNEs
transfer from their regular place of work to operations of the MNE in another country for
a limited period of time, for example from the headquarters to a foreign affiliate.34 Trans-
ferring knowledge is the predominant motive for such within-MNE employee relocations
(e.g., Bonache and Brewster, 2001). In recent surveys of Canadian and German firms,
three quarters of firms state that they use corporate transferees for knowledge transfer,
making knowledge transfer their most frequent purpose (Canadian Employee Relocation
Council, 2013; Djanani et al., 2003, p. 34f.).35 Transferring knowledge is even more im-
portant for large firms: Almost 90% of German firms with 2,001 to 10,000 employees use
corporate transferees to transfer knowledge compared to 79.5% in the group with 501 to
2000 employees, and 60.9% of firms with up to 500 employees. Corporate transferees are
thus a visible reflection of the organization of knowledge in MNEs, and information on the
flows of corporate transferees can be used to obtain evidence concerning the predictions
of Proposition 1.
Proposition 1 shows that the optimal knowledge level at a foreign plant increases with
the communication costs between the plant and the headquarters. MNEs have two options
to increase knowledge at a foreign plant through corporate transferees: Either they send
knowledgeable employees to the foreign operations, or they train foreign employees at the
headquarters. In either case, Proposition 1 predicts that the observed share of corporate
transferees in MNEs' employment should increase with the communication costs between
34Many countries provide special visa for corporate transferees, for example the US L-1 visa. Such
visas are typically available only for managers, specialists, and trainee employees (e.g., European Union,
2014).
35The Canadian Employee Relocation Council (CERC) conducted a survey of Canadian firms in Octo-
ber 2013. Djanani et al. (2003) surveyed all listed stock corporations in Germany in 2003. Both surveys
allowed multiple responses. Though firms also use corporate transferees for other purposes--to support
the establishment of foreign operations (65.3%) and improve communication within the firm (55.8%) in
Germany, and to address talent shortages in the local labor market (61%) and for career development
(43%) in Canada--Bonache and Brewster (2001) argue that only knowledge transfer consistently explains
the use of corporate transferees by MNEs, in particular why their use has increased despite advances in
communication and information technologies.
26
the two countries.
Prediction 1. The share of corporate transferees from country j in country k in MNEs'
employment increases with the bilateral communication costs jk
between the two countries.
4.1 Data
Obtaining evidence for Prediction 1 requires data on the bilateral flows of corporate
transferees and MNEs' employment, as well as measures for the bilateral communication
costs.
Corporate transferees. The data on the corporate transferees come from Finaccord,
a market research company. The data contain information on the number of corporate
transferees from 25 source countries in 29 host countries, as well as selected source-host
country pairs with significant expatriate populations for the year 2009. The information
covers transfer periods of between one and five years.36 The data are left-censored at 100,
and do not distinguish between transferees sent from the headquarters to the foreign op-
erations and foreign employees being trained at the headquarters. Appendix D.1 provides
a list of source and host countries.
MNEs' employment. To measure bilateral FDI flows, I use data on employment by
MNEs from country j in country k provided by the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD). Although the data are comprehensive, they do
not contain information on all country pairs in the corporate transferee data. Bilateral
employment is available for 316 country pairs. Appendix D.1 provides details concerning
the variable construction.
Communication costs. To approximate the bilateral communication costs jk
, I em-
ploy the overlap of office hours, the flight time between the main economic cities of the
source and host countries, several measures for the similarity of languages, and the in-
ternet bandwidth as a measure of communication technologies. I refrain from generic
measures with various alternative interpretations, such as distance. Table 2 provides an
overview of the model parameters, their empirical analogs, and the data sources.
The office hours overlap captures the fact that time zone differences inhibit communi-
cation between the foreign operations and the MNEs' headquarters. Personnel at either
location may have to work overtime to communicate. Using e-mail as a time-independent
36Back of the envelope calculations using the survey data from Djanani et al. (2003) suggest that more
than two thirds of corporate transferees are transferred for periods longer than one year.

means of communication only mitigates the problem because questions cannot be ad-
dressed directly, which causes delay. The lower the office hours overlap, the higher the
proportion of problems is that a foreign plant has to address on its own. The lower the
office hours overlap, the higher the share of corporate transferees should be. The variable
is computed as max{10 - |time difference in hours|, 0}.
The flight time captures how quickly managers can travel to the foreign operations
and address potential issues in the production process on site.37 Despite technological
advances, face-to-face communication is often indispensable to ensure successful produc-
tion (e.g., UNCTAD, 2004). As higher flight times impede communication, the share of
corporate transferees should increase with the flight time.
37I use Frankfurt for the flight times from and to Germany for consistency with section 5.
28
Linguistic proximity captures difficulties in the direct communication between two
individuals. I employ the common official language indicator, the common spoken and
common native language measures, as well as the linguistic proximity index from Melitz
and Toubal (2014). "Common spoken language" measures the probability  [0, 1] that two
randomly chosen individuals from two countries speak the same language, and "common
native language" encompasses the probability that they share their native language. The
variable "linguistic proximity" captures the notion that it is easier to learn a language and
to express oneself precisely the closer that language is to one's mother tongue. Undoubt-
edly, international business communication often takes place in English. Still, non-native
English speakers tend to develop their own English dialect, strongly influenced by their
native languages and often difficult for native English speakers to understand (Gardner,
2013). Linguistic proximity is therefore appropriate to capture frictions in communication
despite the use of English in business contexts.
To measure the quality of communication technologies, I use data on the internet
bandwidth. Internet bandwidth is comparable across countries, which is not the case for
price data that may capture the unobserved quality of service. It is available for many
countries, and is arguably exogenous to bilateral FDI flows, unlike the telecommunications
traffic for example.
Summary statistics are provided in Appendix D.2.
4.2 Empirical specification
I specify the following regression equation to provide evidence concerning Prediction 1:
ln
# corporate transfereesjk
Employmentjk
+ Employmentkj
= 0
+ 1
jk
+ 2
dcens
+ k
+ j
+ jk
(30)
The dependent variable is the share of corporate transferees in the total bilateral employ-
ment of MNEs in countries j and k. I take the log because the distribution of the share
in levels is right-skewed. As indicated above, MNEs may send corporate transferees from
the headquarters to foreign operations, or train foreign employees at the headquarters.
The transferee data do not distinguish between the two modes, so I put the sum of em-
ployment by MNEs from the source country j in the host country k, Employmentjk
, and
employment by MNEs from country k in country j, Employmentkj
, in the denominator.
The explanatory variable of interest is jk
, the communication costs between the two
countries. The expected sign of 1
depends on the measure of jk
. dcens
is a dummy for
observations with censored information on the transferee flows. j
, k
denote source and
host country dummies to capture other determinants of the corporate transferee flows.
Proposition 1 shows that the host country learning costs and wages affect the knowledge
29
level at an affiliate. However, it is difficult to derive their impact on the flow of corporate
transferees without information on whether the transferees are sent from headquarters to
affiliates or vice versa. More generally, the host and source country fixed effects capture
any factors that generally increase or decrease the number of corporate transferees sent
from or to certain countries. jk
is an error term.
Alternatively, I could specify a Tobit model with the number of corporate transferees
as the dependent variable. I prefer the above specification for two reasons. First, the
specification permits the use of source and host country fixed effects. A Tobit model
with fixed effects entails an incidental parameters problem: around 60 fixed effects are
estimated from around 300 observations. Second, the employment of MNEs is a control
variable in the Tobit specification, resulting in simultaneity bias because the size of foreign
operations depends on the organization of knowledge reflected in the corporate transferees.
Appendix D.3 reports the results of Tobit regressions without fixed effects that are in line
with the main results.
4.3 Descriptive evidence and regression results
Figure 1 provides graphical evidence of the relationship between the share of corporate
transferees in total bilateral employment by MNEs and the communication costs. The
figure plots the mean share of corporate transferees for the quartiles of the communication
cost measures.38
Figure 1 lends strong support to Prediction 1: As expected, the share of corporate
transferees in the total employment of MNEs increases with higher bilateral communica-
tion costs. The mean share of corporate transferees is lower for higher quartiles of the
distribution in office hours overlap. Likewise, it is lower for higher quartiles of the prob-
ability that two randomly chosen individuals speak the same language, and for higher
quartiles of the log internet bandwidth. The mean share of corporate transferees is higher
for higher quartiles of the flight time.
The regression results in Table 3 confirm the graphical evidence. Columns 1 to 4
separately include the different measures for the communication costs. The regression
results imply that an overlap in office hours of one hour longer is associated with a
decrease in the share of corporate transferees of 12%. A one hour longer flight time
leads to an 8% increase in the share of corporate transferees. The language variables
all enter negatively. Only common spoken language and the linguistic proximity index
38Figure 1 provides bar plots as scatter plots are difficult to interpret for three of the four communication
cost measures: the office hours overlap is categorical, the internet bandwidth takes on a limited number
of values as it is a host country characteristic, and the common spoken language variable has a point
mass at 0. Appendix D.3 provides the scatter plot for the flight time.

Figures 1a-1d plot the share of corporate transferees in total bilateral employment by MNEs for quartiles
of communication cost measures: office hours overlap (1a), flight time (1b), the probability that two
randomly chosen individuals speak the same language (1c), and log bandwidth (1d). The figures include
only uncensored observations.
are (marginally) significant, consistent with the ease of communication being decisive for
corporate transferee flows.39 Quantitatively, a higher probability of 10 percentage points
that two randomly chosen individuals speak the same language is associated with decrease
in the share of corporate transferees of 5%. Linguistic proximity only takes four values:
0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75. Closer linguistic proximity--for example, an increase from 0.5 to
0.75 if two languages belong to the same sub-branch and not only the same branch of
a language tree--increases the share of corporate transferees by 7%. An increase in the
internet bandwidth of 10% leads to a 3% decrease in the share of corporate transferees.
In column 5, the significant covariates from columns 1 to 4 are jointly included. Signs
are robust, but the significance levels decrease, reflecting that the different measures are
39Jointly included in regressions, common official, native, and spoken languages capture different as-
pects of language: common native language captures the impact of common ethnicity and trust, common
official language the effect of institutions, and common spoken language the ease of communication (Melitz
and Toubal, 2014).

correlated. The office hours overlap turns insignificant. Columns 6 and 7 add source
country dummies. As overlap and flight time are most strongly correlated, the models
separately include the two variables and restore their significance levels. The common
spoken language variable turns insignificant, but the significant linguistic proximity vari-
able shows that language matters. Column 8 adds host country dummies. The bandwidth
drops as it is a host country characteristic. As before, only one of office hours overlap
and flight time is significant. Common spoken language is insignificant, but linguistic
proximity is negative and significant.
In summary, the findings confirm Prediction 1: The share of corporate transferees
increases with the communication costs. As corporate transferees are predominantly used
for knowledge transfer, the findings imply that MNEs assign higher levels of knowledge to
foreign affiliates if their communication costs with the headquarters are higher, consistent
with Proposition 1.

5 Communication costs and MNEs' foreign sales
5.1 Data
I use detailed firm-level data on German MNEs to obtain empirical evidence concerning
the model implications for the distribution of MNEs' foreign sales derived in section 3. I
augment the data with sector-level export data. The data are uniquely suited to studying
the model predictions. Germany has long been one of the largest source countries of both
exports and FDI worldwide: According to WTO and UNCTAD information, Germany
was the largest or second largest exporter in the world and held the fourth largest foreign
investment position during the 1999-2010 sample period. The communication costs be-
tween the home and the foreign country are the main driver of the model predictions, so
the empirical analyses put particular emphasis on them. The implications for wages are
not testable due to the lack of appropriate data.
Foreign sales. I use the German central bank's Microdatabase Direct investment (MiDi).
The database consists of a panel of yearly information on virtually the universe of foreign
affiliates of German MNEs from 1999 to 2010. German residents are legally obliged to
report information on the financial characteristics of their foreign investments once these
meet the reporting requirements (Lipponer, 2009). The database contains detailed bal-
ance sheet information, including the sales, the number of employees, and the financial
structure of every affiliate. The data also include parent and affiliate sectors, mostly at
the two-digit level. From 2002 onwards, information on the domestic sales and the number
of employees is available.
I clean the data (see Appendix E.1 for details), and restrict the sample to majority-
owned affiliates. The model applies to situations in which the parent is actively involved
in the local production. This is unlikely if other shareholders own the majority of the
affiliate. The great level of detail in the MNE data makes it possible to obtain evidence
concerning the model predictions for the distribution of foreign sales both at the firm and
the sector level.
Exports. I use data on German exports from BACI, a trade database provided by
CEPII and containing cleaned trade information from the Comtrade database. The data
are at the six-digit product level. The database does not contain firm information. I
translate the product codes into two-digit sector codes using conversion tables from the
United Nations Statistics Division to use the export data and the foreign sales data in
sector-level analyses.
33
Communication costs and other covariates. I employ the same communication
cost measures as in section 4, with the exception of linguistic proximity. The linguistic
proximity variable in Melitz and Toubal (2014) only takes four values. The classification
of languages by Ethnologue provides seven linguistic nodes for German, so I construct
a refined linguistic proximity measure as a function of the number of linguistic nodes
common to German and each language spoken by at least 20% of people in the host
country following Spolaore and Wacziarg (2009). I take the simple average in the case of
several languages.40
The home country k is Germany for all MNEs in my sample. As the communication
cost measures are mostly time-invariant, using host country fixed effects is not possible. I
therefore control for the other model parameters and potential omitted variables. Table 2
provides an overview of the model parameters, the empirical analogs, and the data sources.
I use data on GDP and GDP per capita to measure variation in demand due to
differences in the market size and income across countries. I measure the learning costs
using the average years of schooling41 and employ information on the unit labor costs to
measure wages.42
I employ data on the bilateral geographic distance, the average effectively applied
tariffs in the parent sector, and the costs of importing and of enforcing contracts to
measure trade costs. Taken together, these data cover many of the aspects of trade costs
that Anderson and van Wincoop (2004) list in their survey.43 To account for factors that
may influence sales but are not included in the model, I add measures of the investment
climate: the statutory tax rate and indicators on the rule of law, government effectiveness,
corruption, and regulatory quality.
I take the logarithms of the covariates if their distribution in levels is skewed. Ap-
pendix E.2 provides summary statistics.
40Specifically, I use # common nodes-7
7
, slightly modifying the formula in Spolaore and Wacziarg
(2009).
41The data are for 2000, 2005, and 2010. I assign the value of the closest year to my 1999-2010 sample.
In unreported regressions, I use the public expenditure on education and PISA scores, and obtain similar
results.
42I have experimented with the Occupational Wages around the World Database by Freeman and
Oostendoorp. However, its overlap with the MiDi database is limited. Data are available for only 20%
of observations.
43Data on cif/fib­values are not available for Germany, so the physical transport costs are difficult to
capture.
34
5.2 Communication costs and the within-firm distribution of
sales
The high level of detail in the MiDi database makes it possible to provide empirical
evidence concerning the MNE-level predictions of the model. Propositions 3 and 4 show
that both horizontal and vertical MNEs' foreign sales decrease with the communication
costs between the headquarters and the foreign plant. This yields the second empirical
prediction.
Prediction 2. An MNE's foreign sales in a host country j decrease with the bilateral
communication costs jk
between country j and the home country k of the MNE.
5.2.1 Empirical specification
To ensure consistency in the level of analysis of the model, I aggregate the affiliate­level
information at the parent­country­year level. The data set contains 164,604 parent­
country­year observations. I log-linearize the theory expression for sales pj

ln (pj

estimate a reduced-form version of the resulting equation. Due to the non-linear nature
of the original equation, it is not possible to provide a structural interpretation of the
resulting parameter estimates.

including trade costs and investment climate measures, to ensure that coefficient estimates

MNE­country­year specific error term. The MNE­year fixed effects absorb the effect
of ¯
zi
and, more generally, of any MNE characteristics that may influence performance
across destinations. To account for correlations of sales across countries and over time,
the standard errors are clustered by MNE.
The empirical approach controls for firm heterogeneity as source of differences in
MNEs' performance across markets and thus mitigates bias due to the self-selection of
firms across countries. Nonetheless, the set of locations is a choice variable of the firm
and does not vary exogenously. It is difficult to guarantee that the estimation conditions

all information available to the MNE, so the results may be biased due to unobservable
MNE­country-specific factors. Subsection 5.3 addresses the issue of self-selection. It is
necessary to keep it in mind when interpreting the regression results in this subsection.44
5.2.2 Regression results
Table 4 presents the regression results for Prediction 2. The table displays seven specifica-
tions. Columns 1 and 2 contain the model parameters: the communication and learning
costs, the wages, and the market size. The specifications are displayed separately because
the wage data are only available for OECD countries, so the sample size decreases once
wages are included. Columns 3 to 5 add the trade costs. Columns 6 and 7 additionally
include measures for the quality of the investment climate.
Table 4 displays the number of MNEs, the number of country combinations, and the
number of countries in the regression sample, together with the number of observations.
The number of country combinations is the number of distinct combinations of countries in
which the MNEs in the sample are active. The number is decisive because the variation
within MNEs across countries drives the regression results.45 The number of country
combinations exceeds the number of MNEs because MNEs change the set of investment
destinations over time.
The regression results lend strong support for Prediction 2. The office hours overlap
has a positive effect on foreign sales typically significant at the 5% or 1% level. The flight
time generally has a highly significant negative effect on foreign sales. The two measures
are not always both significant, as they are strongly correlated, similar to the regression
results in section 4. At least one of the language variables has a significantly positive effect
through specifications, except for column 5, where the sample size is low. Higher internet
bandwidth significantly increases foreign sales. The coefficient is positive and of a similar
size, but insignificant in column 5, which probably also stems from the smaller number of
observations. Consistent with the model, the regressions show that communication costs
affect MNEs' foreign sales, even if other determinants of foreign sales are controlled for.
The other covariates have plausible effects. Foreign sales tend to be higher in larger
countries as measured by log GDP. Log GDP per capita has a negative effect on foreign
sales once labor costs are controlled for. Given the market size and the labor costs,
MNEs tend to sell less in less populous countries. Lower learning costs, as measured
44A natural experiment, i.e., an exogenous change in the communication costs with a subgroup of
countries, would help to address this problem. Estimating a Heckman selection model, as in Keller and
Yeaple (2013), is an alternative option, but would not permit a focus on within-MNE variation across
countries as using firm­year fixed effects is not possible.
45Due to missing values for the covariates, not all the countries are always included in the regression
sample.
36
by higher average years of schooling, significantly increase foreign sales, as do lower unit
labor costs. In terms of the impact of learning costs and wages on foreign sales discussed
in subsection 3.1, this finding implies that the direct negative effect of these variables is
not outweighed by indirect adjustments to the organization of knowledge.
Higher trade costs--as reflected by higher distance and higher tariffs--increase for-
eign sales, consistent with a horizontal motive of foreign investment. The positive effect
of distance is notable: Once communication costs are controlled for, distance does not
decrease foreign sales. The trade cost measures are all insignificant in column 5, which
is most probably driven by the low number of observations as the costs of importing and
enforcing contracts are only available for a relatively small number of countries and years.
MNEs tend to sell more in countries with a higher statutory tax rate. This probably
reflects the fact that higher sales are necessary to produce profitably despite the higher tax
rates. MNEs also tend to sell more in countries with better governance. One coefficient
is surprising: The rule of law measure enters as significantly negative. Taken together,
though, the investment climate measures still speak in favor of a better investment climate
increasing foreign sales.

5.2.3 Evidence of the interdependence of MNEs' sales
The comprehensiveness of the MiDi database also makes it possible to provide evidence
concerning the prediction that MNEs' sales are interdependent across countries.
Prediction 3. An MNE's foreign sales in a host country j decrease with the production
quantities at other investment destinations qk
, k = j of the MNE.
Prediction 3 is based on the second implication of Proposition 4: The sales of an MNE
in different countries are interdependent because the affiliates share common headquarters.
The MNE organizes knowledge such that the marginal costs of production are lower the
larger an affiliate, at the expense of higher marginal costs in other locations. Consequently,
output in country k = j, ceteris paribus, has a negative impact on the sales in country j.
Providing evidence regarding this prediction entails several difficulties. First, regress-
ing sales in j on sales in k is subject to endogeneity bias due to simultaneity. Second,
firms non-randomly establish and shut down affiliates. Finally, an MNE's output and
sales depend on total firm knowledge. The model takes knowledge as given, but in prac-
tice, MNEs may have an incentive to innovate if their affiliates grow. Thus, high sales
in k may lead to high sales in j through adjustments in firm knowledge.
To address these issues, I focus on foreign affiliates of German MNEs in one foreign
country. I choose France, because it yields the highest number of observations for the
following analyses. I follow the French affiliates from the first year in my sample and study
whether their sales growth is negatively correlated with the sales growth of their parents'
affiliates in other countries. I focus on sales growth rather than sales in levels to take
account of the fact that high foreign sales may lead to adjustments in firm knowledge that
increase sales across countries. To address the simultaneity bias, I apply an identification
strategy proposed by Desai, Foley, and Hines (2009) and use GDP growth as an exogenous
determinant of the sales growth in instrumental variable (IV) regressions. I instrument
the observed sales growth of an MNE in other countries with the GDP growth at the 1999
locations of the firm. Thus, the estimation is robust to non-random entry and exit.
Specifically, I estimate the following regression:
Sales growthi France t
= 0
+ 1
Sales growthi j=France t
+ s
+ t
+ uit
(32)
i.e., I regress sales growth in France on sales growth at the MNE's other locations, and
a set of sector and year dummies s,t
. I estimate two variants of the equation. First, I
use the difference in log sales in France as the dependent variable and the log difference
of average sales at the MNE's other locations as the independent variable. I instrument
the latter with the log difference of average GDP at the MNE's 1999 locations. Second, I

beginning and end of period values.
calculate sales growth rates following Desai et al. (2009), and instrument the sales growth
rates at the MNE's other locations using GDP growth rates and, to make them directly
comparable, the growth rates of GDP per capita.
Table 5 displays the regression results. Higher sales growth at the other locations of
the firm is associated with higher sales growth in France according to the OLS regression
in column 1. The magnitude of the coefficient is similar to the coefficients found in
Desai et al. (2009). Column 2 presents the results of the IV specification that takes the
endogeneity of the sales growth at the other locations due to simultaneity and due to
innovations in the knowledge level into account. Consistent with the predictions of the
model, I find that higher sales growth at the other locations of an MNE is associated with
lower sales growth in France. The coefficient is marginally significant with a P-value of
10.1%. Columns 3 and 4 confirm this result.
The results support Prediction 3: Higher growth at an MNE's other foreign locations
is associated with lower growth in France. This finding may seem at odds with the finding
of Desai et al. (2009), who show that higher foreign employment and asset growth are
associated with higher domestic growth in these variables. In fact, though, the different
findings are easily reconcilable within the model of the organization of knowledge in
MNEs. On the one hand, Proposition 4 predicts that the sales of an MNE decrease
with the production quantities at the MNE's other location, consistent with Table 5. On
the other hand, foreign activity may lead to employment growth in the home country--
even if the domestic production quantity decreases--because the MNE hires additional
managers at headquarters. In addition, multinational parents may expand domestic assets
40
and employment because foreign growth entails an incentive to innovate, as also pointed
out by Desai et al. (2009).
Although Table 5 thus supports the predictions of the model in this paper, it is im-
portant to note that various forces may drive the results. Other than the organization of
knowledge, financial or managerial constraints may lead to a negative association in sales
across countries (see, e.g., Manova, Wei, and Zhang, forthcoming; Yeaple, 2013). Unfor-
tunately, disentangling the sources is not possible as it requires more detailed information
on MNEs' organization and activities.
5.3 Communication costs, aggregate exports and affiliate sales
The effect of the bilateral communication costs on single MNEs, together with the model
predictions on the self-selection of firms into foreign destinations, implies that communi-
cation costs have an important impact on aggregate foreign investment flows.
Prediction 4. The ratio of aggregate affiliate sales to aggregate exports in a host country j
decreases with the communication costs between country j and the home country k, jk
.
It increases with the trade costs between country j and the home country k, jk
.
5.3.1 Empirical specification
To test Prediction 4, I aggregate the affiliate-level information on foreign sales in the MiDi
data at the country­affiliate sector­year­level. I aggregate across affiliate sectors because
the model predicts that foreign affiliate sales and exports are substitutable. I merge the
aggregate affiliate sales data with the sector level export data from the BACI database.
I specify a regression equation similar to Helpman et al. (2004) and Oldenski (2012):

The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the ratio of total affiliate sales to
total export sales in a sector s in country j and year t. The covariates of interest are
the bilateral communication costs j0t
and the trade costs j0t
between a foreign country
j and Germany, country 0. The other covariates are defined as above. s
is a vector
of sector fixed effects that capture sectoral differences in the fixed costs of exporting
and FDI, differences in the size dispersion of firms across sectors, and other sectoral
characteristics that may affect the choice between exporting and FDI (for the impact of

The model predicts that higher communication costs have a negative effect and higher
trade costs have a positive effect on the ratio of affiliate sales to exports. One component of
the trade costs are information costs (Anderson and van Wincoop, 2004). The measures
for the bilateral communication costs are likely to be correlated with the information
costs. In fact, both language and flight time empirically affect trade flows (e.g., Melitz and
Toubal, 2014; Hummels and Schaur, 2013), although Helpman, Melitz, and Rubinstein
(2008) have shown that language predominantly affects the self-selection of firms into
exporting. This introduces a bias against finding an effect from the communication costs
because the negative effect of the communication costs on the aggregate foreign sales has
to outweigh the positive influence of information costs on exports.
The sector-level regressions mitigate the bias due to the self-selection of MNEs into
foreign countries that may be present in the MNE-level regressions. Aggregating over firms
integrates out random unobservables that affect both the performance and the investment
decision of firms. At the same time, the sector level regressions may still be biased if
exports or foreign sales are zero for some sector­country combinations: Observed zeros
are non-random and result if no firm in a sector is sufficiently productive to invest in
or export to a certain country (Helpman et al., 2008). I observe positive exports in all
sectors to all foreign countries with a full set of covariates, so I do not need to account for
self-selection into exporting. However, I do not observe positive foreign sales in all sector­
foreign country pairs. I therefore adapt the two-stage estimation procedure in Helpman
et al. (2008) and estimate a selection equation for foreign investment using the costs, time,
and number of procedures of starting a business and the existence of a bilateral investment
treaty as exclusion restrictions (see Appendix E.3 for details). I then insert non-linear
transformations of the predicted probability to conduct FDI in estimation equation (33).
Specifically, I insert the Mill's ratio and polynomials of the sum of the Mill's ratio and
the inverse predicted probability of FDI, as Helpman et al. (2008).
5.3.2 Regression results
Table 6 displays the regression results. Columns 1 to 3 contain the measures for the trade
costs, market size, learning cost, and wages, i.e., only known determinants of the export­
FDI trade-off. Column 4 adds the communication costs. Columns 5 and 6 additionally
include investment climate measures. Column 7 takes selection into foreign investment
into account.46
Consistent with the literature, higher trade costs--as reflected in greater geographic
46The number of observations drops in column 7 because the costs of starting a business used as an
exclusion restriction are only available from 2003, and all MNEs invest in all countries in three sectors,
so it is not possible to estimate a selection equation including sector dummies for these sectors.

distance and higher tariffs--shift the decision between exporting and affiliate sales towards
affiliate sales. The effects are significant, with the exception of column 3. Column 3 in-
cludes the costs of importing and enforcing contracts as additional trade cost measures.
The costs of importing take up the effect of distance and tariffs. Higher costs of enforcing
contracts, although listed as trade costs in Anderson and van Wincoop (2004), have a
stronger negative effect on affiliate sales than exports, most likely reflecting their correla-
tion with the quality of the investment climate. Notably, the effect of the average tariffs is
of similar size throughout the specifications, whereas the coefficient of distance increases
substantially once the communication costs measures are included. This finding is consis-
tent with the interpretation that distance picks up the effect of omitted communication
cost measures in gravity regressions of foreign affiliate sales, which leads to a negative
coefficient of distance in the gravity regressions and a downward bias in the coefficients
in columns 1 to 3.
The results for the impact of the communication costs strongly support the model
predictions. A larger overlap in office hours increases the ratio of affiliate sales to exports.
The effect is highly significant and of similar magnitude throughout the specifications. A
longer flight time has the predicted negative effect on the dependent variable. The effect
is insignificant if the specification accounts for selection into foreign investment, although
this is probably driven by a loss of precision reflected in the much larger standard error. A
higher probability of a common spoken language or higher linguistic proximity increases
the ratio of affiliate sales to exports. A common native and official language are mostly
insignificant, consistent with communication being the decisive driver of the effect of
language on foreign affiliate sales (see also the discussion in section 4). The positive effect
of linguistic proximity in column 7 is particularly noteworthy: Helpman et al. (2008)
find that language does not affect exports once the selection of firms into exporting is
taken into account. In contrast, higher linguistic proximity increases affiliate sales even
if the regressions account for the self-selection into FDI. This underlines the relevance
of communication costs for MNEs. Higher internet bandwidth has a positive effect on
the dependent variable. Internet bandwidth has a positive effect on firms' self-selection
into foreign countries (see Table E.2 in Appendix E.3), but does not affect the ratio of
affiliate sales and exports once the self-selection is accounted for. The regression results
thus confirm that communication costs have a substantial effect on the aggregate foreign
investment flows.
Concerning the other covariates, GDP has a positive effect, as has the average years
of schooling. GDP per capita and foreign wages have negative effects, all as in the MNE-
level regressions. GDP is less significant and GDP per capita is insignificant in column 7,
indicating that much of their effect in columns 1 to 6 is driven by the self-selection of firms
44
into exporting and FDI. Higher regulatory quality and lower corruption increase foreign
sales relative to exports, which is plausible, but they are not robustly significant.
In summary, the estimates strongly support that communication costs are an impor-
tant determinant of aggregate foreign sales and make a convincing case in support of the
general equilibrium implications of the model of the organization of knowledge in MNEs.
5.4 The organization of knowledge vs. monitoring
One could be concerned that the empirical results capture the effect of monitoring and not
the effect of the organization of knowledge on MNEs' behavior, for example because the
communication costs measures are correlated with monitoring costs. Two recent papers
find that investment in a plant increases after a new airline route between the firm's head-
quarters and the plant location is introduced (Giroud, 2013), and that greater distance
between the establishment and headquarters is associated with shorter establishment sur-
vival (Kalnins and Lafontaine, 2013). Both articles attribute their findings to monitoring
problems and information asymmetries between firm headquarters and establishments.
While I do not deny that monitoring is an important factor in firm efficiency, I would like
to stress that monitoring does not fully explain the behavior of MNEs for three reasons.
First, the data on corporate transferees provides direct evidence that higher communi-
cation costs increase within-MNE knowledge transfers. Monitoring is not even mentioned
as a motivation for the use of corporate transferees in the surveys of German and Canadian
firms.
Second, a monitoring model does not explain why MNE wage premiums emerge. In-
stead, the predictions of monitoring-based models are at odds with the empirical evidence.
Assume that the costs of monitoring vary across countries and that the cross-border mon-
itoring costs exceed the within-country monitoring costs. Then, only firms with better
monitoring technology self-select into FDI. This implies that MNEs pay lower wages in
the home country than domestic firms: Firms with better monitoring technology are able
to implement optimal effort levels with lower wage payments. This is at odds with em-
pirical evidence on home country wage premiums. Likewise, a monitoring model cannot
explain residual MNE wage premiums in the foreign country because it predicts that for-
eign affiliates and domestic firms in the foreign country with the same marginal costs pay
the same wages. Appendix F sketches a formal analysis of this argument.
Third and finally, the bilateral communication costs have an effect on foreign sales
even if the monitoring costs are controlled for by including bilateral trust as a proxy
variable in the regressions. Higher bilateral trust decreases monitoring costs and allows
firms to decentralize more easily (Bloom et al., 2012). Table 7 displays regression results
including bilateral trust between countries from the Eurobarometer survey as a covariate.
45
Bilateral trust does not have a significant effect on the MNE-level distribution of sales
or on the ratio of aggregate affiliate sales to exports. I obtain similar estimates for the
communication costs, even though the number of observations is substantially reduced.
Thus, monitoring cannot explain the communication cost estimates in subsections 5.2
and 5.3.
In summary, the empirical analyses provide convincing evidence in favor of the predic-
tions in the model of the organization of knowledge in MNEs. Evidence concerning the
flows of corporate transferees between countries confirms the prediction of the effect of
the bilateral communication costs on the organization of knowledge. MNE-level analyses
support the predictions regarding the relationship between the communication costs and
MNEs' sales, and the interdependence of sales across countries. The effect of the bilateral
communication costs on aggregate foreign sales and exports is likewise consistent with
the model. Finally, the analyses confirm that alternative possible explanations, such as
monitoring, cannot explain the estimation results.

6 Conclusion
This paper provides the first systematic analysis of the organization of knowledge in
MNEs. It shows that the optimal organization of knowledge in MNEs differs from the
organization of knowledge in domestic firms: MNEs assign higher knowledge levels to pro-
duction workers than if they were non-multinational. The knowledge levels of production
workers increase with the communication costs between the plant and the headquarters,
and they are interdependent across countries. These features of the organization of know-
ledge in MNEs are useful in understanding why MNEs' sales and their probability of
entry decrease with the distance of a country from the home country of the multinational
firm. They also explain why MNEs pay higher wages than equally productive domestic
firms in the home and the foreign countries, and why MNE wage premiums vary with the
nationality of the parent firm. The paper provides comprehensive empirical evidence in
support of the different aspects of the model using novel data on the flows of corporate
transferees between countries and data on German multinational firms.
The paper offers relevant insights for the design of policies aimed at promoting in-
vestment and the diffusion of knowledge across countries. Creating well-paid, relatively
knowledge-intensive new jobs is one of the main objectives of investment promotion efforts
(Javorcik, 2012). The results of this paper generally support the presumption that employ-
ment in MNEs is likely to be more knowledge intensive and better paid than employment
in domestic firms. In their efforts to reap these benefits, countries may be tempted to
focus on investing in targeted information campaigns and a good investment climate in
terms of administration, governance, and the education of their workforce. As this paper
demonstrates, targeted foreign language training and good communication infrastructures
may be equally relevant in fostering FDI inflows as they facilitate multinationals' task of
efficiently organizing knowledge across countries.

where zh and zj are defined by equations (7), (8), and (9); and
00e-(¯
z-zh)(1 + c0zh) - c0zh  0 (A.2)
where zh is defined by equation (10). Furthermore, the fixed costs of FDI fI ensure that en-
trepreneurs only self-select into FDI if they draw a knowledge level ¯
z such that
10e-(¯
z-zh)w0(1 + c0zh) - w1c1zh  0 (A.3)
where zh is defined by equation (11).
Assumption 1 restricts the parameter space such that the following requirements hold:
1. The set of possible values for ¯
z is such that the employees never learn knowledge that the
entrepreneur would not adopt were he free to choose the overall knowledge level (upper
bound).
2. Both employees at the headquarters and employees in the production plants are optimally
involved in the domestic and foreign production process (lower bounds).
To derive equation (A.1), assume that the entrepreneur chooses the total knowledge level z
subject to the constraint that it cannot exceed the knowledge draw: z  ¯
z. For the simplicity
of exposition, I study a domestic firm, where the constraints (2) to (4) substitute zj, nj and nh:

Concerning the lower bounds, in an organization with a headquarters and a production
affiliate, each worker learns zh units of knowledge less than in an organization in which one layer
of employees learns all of the firm's knowledge. A two-layer organization is thus optimal if the
resulting cost decrease c0zh per worker exceeds the costs of hiring managers 00e-(¯
z-zh)(1+c0zh)
(equation A.2). The condition decreases with ¯
z. It ensures zh > 0, because otherwise it would be
better to produce without a headquarters. An analogous condition holds for the foreign country
(equation A.3).

The first order condition is a U-shaped function of zh. Condition (B.1) ensures that the first
order condition is negative at its minimum, so the roots of the first order condition exist. It
is possible to ensure that only firms with values of ¯
z for which the asymmetric solution exists
select into FDI by assuming that fI is sufficiently large. Multiplied by 2q^

B.3 Managerial knowledge (Proposition 2)
Horizontal MNEs. 00w1c1 < 10w0c0, so the knowledge constraint is binding in the home
country: z1  z0 = ¯
z-zh. Take a domestic firm and a horizontal MNE with the same knowledge
level ¯
z. A comparison of equations (9) and (10) shows that zI
h
< zD
h
, i.e., MNEs assign less
knowledge to the headquarters than domestic producers with the same total knowledge ¯
z. At
zh = zD
h
, equation (9) is not fulfilled, but positive. As equation (9) is increasing in zh, zI
h
< zD
h
.
For the MNE wage premiums, the comparison with foreign domestic firms is also relevant.
The proof applies to the comparison of MNEs and domestic firms in the foreign country if c1  c0
because this condition ensures that domestic firms in the foreign country assign at least as much
knowledge to the headquarters as domestic firms in the domestic country.
Vertical MNEs. w1c1 < w0c0, otherwise, vertical FDI is not worthwhile, so 00w1c1 <
10w0c0. Take a domestic firm and a vertical MNE with the same knowledge level ¯
z. Domestic
firms determine zD
h
via 00e-(¯
z-zD
h
)w0(c0 + (1 + c0zD
h

zV
h
via 10e-(¯
z-zV
h
)w0(c0 + (1 + c0zV
h
)) - w1c1 = 0. The equations are increasing in zh. As
10 > 00 and w0c0 > w1c1, zV
h
< zD
h
.
For the MNE wage premiums, the comparison with foreign domestic firms is also relevant.
Take a foreign domestic firm and a vertical MNE with the same knowledge level ¯
z. Foreign
domestic firms determine zD
h
via 11e-(¯
z-zD
h
)w1(c1 + (1 + c1zD
h
) - w1c1 = 0. Vertical MNEs
determine zV
h
via 10e-(¯
z-zV
h
)w0(c0 + (1 + c0zV
h
)) - w1c1 = 0. The equations are increasing in
zh. As 10 > 11 and w0c0 > w1c1, zV
h
< zD
h
.

Neither knowledge gaps at both locations, i.e., zj < ¯
z -zh j, nor overlaps at both locations,
i.e., zj > ¯
z - zh j, are optimal: in the former case, the MNE could produce more output at the
same costs by shifting managerial knowledge to close the gap; the latter case entails waste of
resources.
As the choice set of the MNE is constrained--0 < zk < ¯
z, k = j, h--a solution featuring a
knowledge gap at one and an overlap at the other location does not always exist.

Managerial knowledge depends on the production quantities {qj}1

in both countries, which
leads to an interdependence in the organization of knowledge and the marginal costs of produc-
tion.

The communication costs ~

have a positive direct effect on z~
j
. Due to the non-linearities of the
optimization problem, the total effect cannot be signed analytically. It is positive in simulations.

. The profit maximization problem is an optimization
problem in two variables, q0 and q1. qj affects the optimal solution for qk, k = j, through its
impact on the marginal costs of production k.
To determine the impact of some characteristic xj on the optimal output, I totally differentiate
the system of first order conditions:

The effect of wages w1 is analogous to the effect of c1. Results on sales follow by sales increasing

C.3 General equilibrium
Existence. I follow Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012) to show that a unique equilibrium
exists.
Zero cut-off profit condition: The zero cut-off profit condition starts at the point (0, 0) and
is strictly increasing in the ¯
z, w-plane by:
dw
d¯
z
= -
d0
d¯

Free-entry condition: The free entry condition starts at the point (0, ^
w), where ^
w > 0. Its
60
slope is given by:
dw
d¯
z

N(¯

The free entry condition is increasing up to the intersection with the zero cut-off profit condition
and decreasing otherwise.
A unique intersection exists by the intermediate value theorem.
Comparative statics. To determine the equilibrium effects of transport costs and communi-
cation costs on the export and FDI cut-offs, I totally differentiate the equilibrium conditions (24),
(25), (26) and (27). This yields, with j,I  j(¯
zI, q0(¯

d10

d¯

d10

z
d10
< 0, i.e., the expected profits at entry increase. The sunk costs of entry are
constant. Therefore, the wages increase. This is a contradiction to dw
d10
< 0.
Aggregate implications.
· As the export cut-off ¯
zX is increasing and the FDI cut-off ¯
zI is decreasing in the transport
costs, and the export sales are decreasing in the transport costs, aggregate exports decrease
in the transport costs. Aggregate affiliate sales increase in the transport costs because the
FDI cut-off is decreasing and wages decrease.
· As the FDI cut-off ¯
zI is increasing in the communication costs, and the foreign sales
are decreasing in the communication costs, aggregate MNE foreign sales decrease in the
communication costs. Aggregate exports increase in the communication costs because the
export cut-off is decreasing, the FDI cut-off is increasing and wages decrease.

Corporate transferees. The Finaccord data contain information on corporate transferees
· from the source countries Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany,
Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United
Kingdom, the United States
· in the host countries listed as source countries, as well as in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.
In addition, the data contains information on corporate transferees from the source country
Indonesia in the host countries Hong Kong, Japan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Taiwan,
from the source country Mexico in the host countries Canada and Spain, from the source country
Morocco in the host countries France and Spain, from the source country the Philippines in the
host countries Canada, Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan, from the source country Thailand in the
host countries Japan and Taiwan, and from the source country Vietnam in in the host countries
China, Japan and Poland.
Employment by MNEs. I use information on the total employment by MNEs from the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The data contain infor-
mation reported by the host and the source country. To measure the employment of MNEs
from country j in a country k, I use the data on inward employment reported by country k.
To measure the employment of MNEs from country k in country j, I use the data on outward
employment reported by country k. I only use information reported by the source (host) country
j to measure inward (outward) employment of country k if the report from country k is missing.
The employment data are not available for all country pairs with corporate transferees
information, predominantly because some countries are not OECD members and/or do not
report. Table D.1 displays the country pairs in the final dataset.

sample.
D.3 Additional regression results
The data on the corporate transferees is left censored at 100. I assume that the error term is
normally distributed jk  N(0, 1) and estimate the Tobit model:
ln(# corporate transfereesjk
) = 0 + 1 ln(employmentjk
+ employmentkj
) + 2jk + jk (D.1)
The Tobit model does not allow to include source and host country fixed effects because they
entail an incidental parameters problem: almost 60 fixed effects are estimated off 300 observa-
tions. Further, the Tobit model suffers from simultaneity bias because the employment at MNEs
has to be included as control variable.

E Foreign sales
E.1 Data cleaning
The Microdatabase Direct investment (MiDi) contains virtually the universe of German FDI
because residents are legally obliged to report information on their investments to the central
bank once their investments meet the reporting requirements. The reporting requirements vary
across years. Until 2002, information on stakes of at least 10% in a firm with a balance sheet
total of more than 5 million euro and stakes of at least 50% in a firm with a balance sheet total
of more than 0.5 million euro had to be reported. Since 2002, information on stakes of at least
10% in a firm with a balance sheet total of more than 3 million euro has to be reported. The
same information has to be provided on branches or permanent establishments if their operating
assets exceed the reporting threshold (Lipponer, 2009).
I drop observations on 26,042 affiliates (7.9% of all observations) of investors that are govern-
ment institutions, private households, agriculture or mining companies and housing enterprises.
I drop agriculture and mining companies because natural resources are decisive for their invest-
ments, but ignored in the theory and the empirics. I drop housing enterprises because they often
report sales of zero, even though they are not small, which would lead to measurement error in
the analysis.
I restrict the data so that all observations meet a uniform threshold: I keep reports on
affiliates with a balance sheet total of at least 5 million euro and a degree of participation of at
least 10%, or with a balance sheet total between 3 and 5 million euro, but parent stakes of at
least 50%. 36,754 observations drop from the sample (12.0% of the remaining observations).
65
Some affiliates are reported several times, because an investor has direct and indirect inter-
ests, or because multiple investors hold participating interests in them. I therefore aggregate
direct and indirect participation shares per affiliate before restricting the sample to majority
owned affiliates. 22,425 observations (8.3% of the remaining observations) drop from the sample
because the affiliates are not majority owned. The resulting data set contains 246,394 affiliate­
year observations.

assuming symmetry of the foreign country j and the home country j = 0. The market size ln Q
drops from the equation. It is straightforward to show that the equation can be generalized to
several and potentially asymmetric countries. The foreign market size then influences the trade-
off because the foreign marginal costs 1(·) are a function of the foreign production quantity and
thus of market size.
Helpman et al. (2008) show that selection bias arises if V X
j
= 0 because ¯
zX > ¯
zmax, i.e.,
because no firm has sufficient knowledge to export profitably. As there are positive exports in
all sector-country-year pairs with a full set of covariates, such a selection problem does not arise.
Analogously however, selection bias arises if ¯
zI > ¯
zmax, i.e., if no firm has sufficient knowledge
to invest abroad profitably.
Following Helpman et al. (2008), it is possible to address this bias by estimating a selection
equation for the self-selection of firms in sector s into FDI in country j in year t. I use the costs,
time and number of procedures of starting a business and the existence of a bilateral investment
treaty, denoted by the vector Zjt. I specify the selection equation
sjt = Pr(Affiliate salessjt > 0|observed variables)
= (0 + 1j0t + 2j0t + 3Qjt + 4cjt + 5wjt + 6Xjt + 7Zjt + s + t)
and, as Helpman et al. (2008), include the following transformations of the predicted probability

F Sketch of a monitoring based model
A MNE consists of nh managers in the headquarters in the home country, and nj production
workers in the home country j = 0 and the foreign country j = 1. Production workers input
labor to the production process and the managers supervise them.
As in Qian (1994), output depends on the effort level aj exerted by the production workers
in country j: qj = njaj. Exerting effort is costly. The cost of effort is described by the function
g(a) with g (a) > 0. The managers supervise the production workers to ensure that they exert
a sufficient amount of effort. I assume that the managers exert full effort ah = 1 in supervision,
as in the literature. Production workers know that they are monitored at any point in time with
probability Pj.
The workers receive the wage wj if they are monitored and exert a sufficient amount of effort
aj  a
j
or if they are not monitored, and nothing if they are supervised and found to exert
insufficient effort aj < a
j
. It is necessary to assume that they receive the wage whenever they
are not monitored because the firm would otherwise have an incentive to claim that they are
never monitored. If workers can prove whether they are monitored or not, the first best solution
is implementable (Qian, 1994).
The optimal wage is determined by the incentive compatibility constraint that
wj - g(a
j
)  Pj · 0 + (1 - Pj) · wj - g(aj) aj < a
j
,
so wj = 1
Pj
g(a
j
). Wages increase in the optimal effort level a
j
and decrease in the monitoring
probability Pj.
The firm chooses the country and firm specific optimal monitoring probabilities Pj and the
optimal effort levels a
j, j=0,1
to minimize the overall costs of production, which are made up of
factor input costs and monitoring costs. The costs j to monitor a worker vary by country. It is
generally assumed that 1  0, so foreign workers are more costly to monitor. The monitoring
costs are influenced by the firm specific monitoring technology , where lower  corresponds to
a better monitoring technology. The cost minimization problem of a MNE is given by
C(q0, q1) = min
{Pj,a

The remuneration of managers is normalized to 1.
The optimal effort levels are uniform across countries:

The optimal monitoring probabilities are given by
Pj =
g(aj)
1 + j

The optimal monitoring probabilities thus decrease in the monitoring costs j, and increase in
better monitoring technologies -1. Within firms, foreign workers consequently receive higher
optimal wages, and the marginal costs of production are higher, in countries with higher cross
border monitoring costs. The mechanism is therefore suitable for rationalizing the within-firm
differences in sales revealed in subsections 5.2 and 5.3.
As foreign marginal costs increase in j, only firms with better monitoring technolgies -1
are able to profitably invest abroad. Consequently, the remuneration of domestic production
workers of MNEs is lower than the remuneration of production workers of domestic firms, as
P0 = g(a
0
)
1+0
1
2 decreases in  and w0 decreases in P0. Workers at foreign affiliates of MNEs
and workers at domestic firms in the foreign country with the same marginal costs receive the
same wages. These implications are at odds with the empirical evidence.
