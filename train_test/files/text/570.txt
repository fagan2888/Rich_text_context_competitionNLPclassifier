for Hemorrhage-Related Adverse Events From
Clopidogrel Plus Aspirin and From Warfarin

Background: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) with clo-
pidogrel plus aspirin is a well-established antithrom-
botic strategy, with hemorrhage being the chief adverse
event (AE) of concern. Outside of clinical trials, few pub-
lished data describe the magnitude and nature of hem-
orrhage-related AEs from DAT.
Methods: To estimate the numbers and rates of emer-
gency department (ED) visits for hemorrhage-related AEs
(hemorrhage or evaluation for potential hemorrhage) from
DAT in the United States and put them in the context of
those from warfarin, we analyzed AEs from the National
Electronic Injury Surveillance System­Cooperative Ad-
verseDrugEventSurveillanceproject,2006-2008,andout-
patient prescribing from the National Ambulatory Medi-
cal Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey, 2006-2007.
Results: Based on 384 cases, there were an estimated 7654
(95% confidence interval [CI], 3325-11 983) ED visits
annually for hemorrhage-related AEs from DAT com-
pared with 2926 cases and an estimated 60 575 (36 117-
85 033) ED visits from warfarin. Approximately 60% of
ED visits for DAT consisted of epistaxis or other minor
hemorrhages (eg, bleeding from small cuts). The risk of
hospitalization for ED visits involving acute hemor-
rhages was not significantly different between DAT and
warfarin (risk ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.38-1.08). The esti-
mated rate of ED visits involving acute hemorrhages from
DAT was 1.2 per 1000 outpatient prescription visits vs
2.5 per 1000 outpatient prescription visits for warfarin
(risk ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.15-0.83).
Conclusions: These findings indicate that the acute hem-
orrhagic risk with DAT is clinically significant and rein-
force the importance of practitioners and patients rec-
ognizing and anticipating this risk.

mains the standard of care for the treat-
ment of a wide range of thromboembolic
disorders (eg, venous thrombosis, pulmo-
nary embolism, and inherited hyperco-
agulability syndromes), because of the
complexity of warfarin management, its
narrow therapeutic index, and its numer-
ous drug interactions,6-8 the strategy of
DAT has also recently gained increased at-
tention as a potential alternative to war-
farin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fi-
brillation (AF) who are at increased risk
for thromboembolic complications but are
judged to be suboptimal candidates for
warfarin therapy.9-12
In the United States, more than 1 mil-
lion percutaneous coronary intervention
procedures are performed annually, half
of which are in patients older than 65 years
with multiple risk factors for falls or hem-
orrhagic events, and there are almost 2 mil-
lion people with chronic AF, half of whom
are older than 75 years.13,14 This, com-
bined with the growing indications for
DAT and the introduction of new oral an-
tiplatelet agents, suggests that the use of
DAT is likely to expand substantially.15,16

these types of AEs, we placed these data in
the context of similar data for warfarin, an
agent with a related AE profile.

METHODS
We estimated the number of AEs for patients receiving DAT
and for those receiving warfarin based on data from the Na-
tional Electronic Injury Surveillance System­Cooperative Ad-
verse Drug Event Surveillance (NEISS-CADES) project, a na-
tional stratified probability sample of 63 hospitals in the United
States and its territories.19-21 For this analysis, only data from
the 58 participating nonpediatric hospitals were used. In brief,
trained coders at each hospital review clinical records of every
ED visit to identify physician-diagnosed adverse drug events
(ADEs) and report up to 2 medications implicated in each ADE
and any concomitant medications listed in the medical rec-
ord. Coders also record narrative descriptions of the inci-
dents, including physician diagnosis and clinical testing. Nar-
rative descriptions are coded using the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), an international terminol-
ogy used to analyze ADE reports.
For this investigation, an ADE case was defined as an inci-
dent ED visit made by a patient older than 17 years between
January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008, in which (1) clopi-
dogrel, aspirin, or warfarin was implicated in the ED visit and
(2) the ED visit was the result of either an unintentional over-
dose from an antiplatelet or anticoagulant agent (as evidenced
by hemorrhage, laboratory coagulation variable abnormality,
or other toxic effects) or workup for hemorrhage in a patient
receiving an antiplatelet or anticoagulant agent (ie, an ED visit
due to a fall or injury while receiving an antiplatelet or anti-
coagulant agent). The Standardized MedDRA Query for hem-
orrhage, a grouping of relevant MedDRA terms that assists in
retrieval of ADE terms related to a specific condition of inter-
est, was used to identify cases involving hemorrhage. All im-
plicated and concomitant medication fields were searched to
identify the presence of warfarin, clopidogrel, or aspirin. Cases
were excluded if the ED visit was unrelated to a patient's own
medication (eg, as with a patient mistakenly taking an anti-
platelet or anticoagulant medication prescribed to another in-
dividual). The ED cases were categorized as being due to clo-
pidogrel plus aspirin if use of both drugs was documented and
use of neither an anticoagulant medication (warfarin, hepa-
rin, or low-molecular-weight heparin) nor another antiplate-
let medication (dipyridamole or ticlopidine) was docu-
mented. The ED cases were categorized as being due to warfarin
if warfarin was implicated in the AE and use of no other anti-
coagulant medication (heparin or low-molecular-weight hep-
arin) or antiplatelet medication (aspirin, clopidogrel, dipyri-
damole, or ticlopidine) was documented.
We estimated the number of ambulatory care visits at which
clopidogrel plus aspirin or warfarin therapy was prescribed or
continued based on 2 national cross-sectional surveys of am-
bulatory medical care services: the National Ambulatory Medi-
cal Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambula-
tory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS).22 These surveys involve
a multistage sampling design of ambulatory care visits to non­
federally employed office-based physicians and to EDs and out-
patient departments of noninstitutional general and short-
stay hospitals, exclusive of federal, military, and Veterans
Administration hospitals.22 For this investigation, we refer to
all NAMCS/NHAMCS ambulatory care visits at which these
medications were prescribed or continued as "outpatient pre-
scription visits." We used public use data files for 2006 and 2007
(the most recent available) to identify ambulatory care visits
at which clopidogrel plus aspirin (with no concomitant war-
farin documented) or warfarin (with no concomitant clopido-
grel or aspirin documented) was prescribed or continued in pa-
tients older than 17 years. Each drug was identified by searching
the 8 medication fields in each NAMCS/NHAMCS data set for
the Multum Lexicon Drug Database code for the generic in-
gredients.23-25
Each selected NEISS-CADES, NAMCS, and NHAMCS
record was accompanied by a sample weight based on inverse
probability of selection, adjusted for nonresponse and post-
stratified to adjust for the number of annual hospital ED visits
(NEISS-CADES) and adjusted for nonresponse and popula-
tion changes incorporating weight smoothing (NAMCS/
NHAMCS).19,22,26,27 National estimates of ED visits and outpa-
tient prescription visits and corresponding 95% confidence in-
tervals (CIs) were calculated using the SURVEYMEANS pro-
cedure in SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North
Carolina) to account for the sample weights and complex sample
designs. The resulting frequency estimates and CIs derived from
NEISS-CADES data were divided by 3, and those derived from
NAMCS/NHAMCS data were divided by 2, to obtain annual es-
timates. Estimates based on small numbers of cases (20 cases
for the NEISS-CADES project and 30 cases for the NAMCS/
NHAMCS) or with a coefficient of variation greater than 30%
were considered statistically unstable and are noted in the tables.
To assess the risk of selected outcomes (ED visits for any acute
hemorrhage; for epistaxis, skin, or other minor hemorrhages; and
for gastrointestinal tract hemorrhages and ED visits resulting in
hospitalizations) associated with clopidogrel plus aspirin therapy
relative to the risk associated with warfarin use, we divided the
proportion of selected ED visits (for all hemorrhage-related AEs,
those for acute hemorrhages, or those for gastrointestinal tract
hemorrhages) resulting in each specific outcome for DAT by the
comparable proportion for warfarin. The 95% CIs for the com-
ponent proportions (risks) incorporated the inherent variability
in the numerator and the denominator of each risk estimate by
applying the domain estimation feature of the SURVEYMEANS
procedure. The 95% CIs for the risk ratios (RRs) similarly incor-
poratedthevariabilityinthenumeratorsanddenominatorsofboth
component risk estimates.28 The risks of specific outcomes in the
2 separate patient populations were treated as independent (and,
thus, as having zero covariance). A sensitivity analysis indicated
that the conclusions based on the CIs for these RRs were in al-
most all instances robust against moderate to strong correlation
between the 2 estimated risks.
A similar approach was used to assess the relative risks of
ADEs per outpatient prescription visit. We first divided the es-
timated annual number of ED visits for ADEs (for hemorrhage-
related AEs overall and for any acute hemorrhage from the
NEISS-CADES project) by the estimated annual number of out-
patient prescription visits at which clopidogrel plus aspirin or
warfarin was prescribed (from the NAMCS/NHAMCS) to ob-
tain a risk estimate for each prescription group. These risk es-
timates were then used to calculate ratios of the risks associ-
ated with clopidogrel plus aspirin to the comparable risks
associated with warfarin. The accompanying 95% CIs for the
component risks and RRs again recognized variability in the
numerator and denominator of each risk estimate.28 The com-
ponent risk estimates were again assumed to be independent
across patient populations (and, as previously stated, this as-
sumption was complemented by a sensitivity analysis that sug-
gested robustness against nontrivial correlations).
RESULTS
Based on 384 NEISS-CADES cases, an estimated 7654 ED
visits (95% CI, 3325-11 983) were made annually for hem-
orrhage-related AEs by patients receiving clopidogrel plus
aspirin (Table 1). In comparison, based on 2926
NEISS-CADES cases, an estimated 60 575 ED visits (95%
CI, 36 117-85 033) were made annually by patients re-

ceiving warfarin. The median age was 73 years (age range,
27-100 years) for patients taking clopidogrel plus aspi-
rin and 75 years (range, 18-101 years) for patients re-
ceiving warfarin. The number of ED visits for hemorrhage-
related AEs increased with age for clopidogrel plus aspirin
and for warfarin. Females accounted for a nominally lower
proportion of ED visits involving clopidogrel plus aspi-
rin (46.9%; 95% CI, 41.1%-52.8%) than of visits involv-
ing warfarin (53.6%; 48.7%-58.6%).
Almostexclusively,EDvisitsforhemorrhage-relatedAEs
bypatientsreceivingclopidogrelplusaspirinwereforacute
hemorrhages, and an estimated two-thirds of ED visits for
warfarin complications involved acute hemorrhages
(Table 2). The remainder of visits involving warfarin were
for abnormalities in laboratory coagulation variables (eg,
elevationintheinternationalnormalizedratio)withnoevi-
dence of hemorrhage or for evaluation of potential hem-
orrhage from a fall or injury while taking warfarin (26.7%
of ED visits; 95% CI, 21.3%-32.1%) and for toxic effects
otherwise not described (5.7%; 1.6%-9.9%).
For DAT and warfarin, most ED visits for acute hem-
orrhages were composed of epistaxis, skin, or other mi-
nor hemorrhages (59.4%; 95% CI, 44.8%-74.0% and
54.3%; 48.6%-60.0%, respectively). Considering only ED
visits for acute hemorrhages, the risk of epistaxis, skin,
or other minor hemorrhages for clopidogrel plus aspi-
rin therapy was similar to that for warfarin therapy (RR,
1.09; 95% CI, 0.81-1.38). Few DAT-related ED visits for
epistaxis, skin, or other minor hemorrhages resulted in
hospitalization (17 cases), whereas 19.8% (95% CI, 14.0%-
25.6%) of warfarin-related ED visits for these types of hem-
orrhages resulted in hospitalization. Gastrointestinal tract
hemorrhages composed approximately one-third (30.5%;
95% CI, 17.9%-43.1%) of ED visits for acute hemor-
rhages associated with clopidogrel plus aspirin and one-
quarter (22.8%; 16.9%-28.7%) of ED visits for acute hem-
orrhages associated with warfarin use. Considering only
ED visits for acute hemorrhages, the risk of gastrointes-
tinal tract hemorrhages was nominally higher for clopi-
dogrel plus aspirin therapy than for warfarin therapy, but
the difference was not significant (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.70-
1.98). For the subset of ED visits involving gastrointes-
tinal tract hemorrhages, the risk of hospitalization was
similar for both groups (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.81-1.23).
There were too few central nervous system hemor-
rhages (9 cases) with clopidogrel plus aspirin to calcu-
late a national estimate, whereas 3.2% (95% CI, 1.6%-
4.9%) of ED visits for acute hemorrhages due to warfarin
were central nervous system hemorrhages (82 cases).
ConsideringEDvisitsforhemorrhage-relatedAEsover-
all, the risk of hospitalization was significantly lower for
DAT (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.37-0.98). However, when only
ED visits involving acute hemorrhages were consid-
ered, the difference was not statistically significant (RR,
0.73; 95% CI, 0.38-1.08). Specific descriptions of hem-
orrhagic complications from clopidogrel plus aspirin
therapy and from warfarin use are provided in Table 3.
Adjusted for prescribing frequency, the estimated rate
of ED visits for hemorrhage-related AEs overall was ap-
proximately 3 times higher for patients receiving warfarin
vs patients receiving clopidogrel plus aspirin (3.7 vs 1.2 ED
visits per 1000 outpatient prescription visits) (Table 4).
These estimates translated into an RR (for clopidogrel plus
aspirinrelativetowarfarin)significantlybelow1.0(RR,0.34;
95% CI, 0.10-0.57). When only acute hemorrhagic events
were considered, the rate of ED visits for warfarin dropped
(to 2.5 ED visits per 1000 outpatient prescription visits),
whereas the rate for clopidogrel was nearly unchanged.
However, the corresponding RR remained significantly be-
low 1.0 (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.15-0.83).

risks and benefits, and these national public health sur-

veillance data can improve the understanding of the risks
of hemorrhage-related AEs outside the rigorous con-
trolled settings of clinical trials. In absolute terms, the
estimated number of ED visits for hemorrhage-related
complications from DAT (7654 annually) was just more
than one-tenth that from warfarin (60 575 annually). Ac-
counting for prescribing frequency, this difference was
less pronounced but remained statistically significant. We
found that, on average, for every 815 outpatient visits at
which clopidogrel plus aspirin was prescribed, 1 patient
presented to an ED for related bleeding or evaluation for
bleeding; for every 274 outpatient visits at which warfa-
rin was prescribed, 1 patient presented to an ED for re-
lated bleeding or evaluation for bleeding. Treatment with
warfarin has demonstrated clear benefits in numerous set-
tings in which DAT does not have an established role,
and the choice to use warfarin as a comparator is not in-
tended to imply that these safety data can dictate one
choice of antithrombotic strategy over the other; how-
ever, these population-based data contextualizing the
hemorrhagic risks of DAT relative to those of an agent
such as warfarin help identify several important issues
about the scope and magnitude of hemorrhage-related
AEs associated with clopidogrel plus aspirin use.
First, we found that an estimated 60% of ED visits for
clopidogrel plus aspirin­related acute hemorrhages in-
volved epistaxis, skin, or other minor hemorrhages (eg,
bleeding from the mouth, small cuts, bruising, pete-
chiae, and ecchymosis). Although the immediate harm
from these types of hemorrhages may not be severe, this
finding is concerning because these "nuisance" bleed-
ings have been linked to early discontinuation of clopi-
dogrel therapy,29,30 which, in turn, has been associated
with in-stent thrombosis and poor clinical outcomes in
patients who have undergone coronary stenting.31-34 Re-
cent guidelines emphasize the need to educate patients
regarding the potentially serious negative consequences
of premature discontinuation of DAT after coronary stent-
ing.34 The high frequency of ED visits for these types of
hemorrhages reinforces the need for practitioners to un-
derstand the avoidance and management strategies for
these AEs and to incorporate information on minor hem-
orrhages into patient education so that patients know to
anticipate and recognize such events, seek appropriate
treatment, and not discontinue therapy abruptly.34,35
Second, regarding the severity of AEs, life-threatening
hemorrhages, including central nervous system and pul-
monary hemorrhages, seem to be less common with clo-
pidogrel plus aspirin therapy; however, a substantial pro-
portion (almost one-third) of clopidogrel plus aspirin­
related ED visits for hemorrhage-related AEs were serious
enough to require hospitalization. When only visits in-
volving acute hemorrhages were considered (and not el-
evations in laboratory variables or falls/injuries while un-
dergoing antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy), the risk of
clopidogrel plus aspirin­related ED visits resulting in hos-

pirin­related ED visits were for gastrointestinal tract
hemorrhages, and almost 80% of these patients required
hospitalization, also similar to the proportion of patients
hospitalized with gastrointestinal tract hemorrhages due
to warfarin use.
Third, although we found the overall risk of hemor-

than for clopidogrel plus aspirin, a little more than one-
half of the ED visits for acute hemorrhages due to war-
farin were composed of minor hemorrhages and one-
quarter of warfarin-related ED visits, overall, were for
elevation of laboratory coagulation variables without
documentation of hemorrhage. When only visits with
documentation of acute hemorrhage are considered,
the risk of ED visits was only 2-fold higher for warfarin
than for clopidogrel plus aspirin. Although this still

represents a lower risk of hemorrhage with DAT than
with an agent such as warfarin, unlike warfarin, whose
bleeding risk can be successfully minimized by im-
provements in warfarin management, including careful
dose titration, international normalized ratio monitor-
ing, patient education, and comprehensive warfarin
management programs,36-39 there remain few similar in-
terventions for mitigating bleeding harm from anti-
platelet medications.
The rate of ED visits per outpatient prescription visit for
clopidogrel plus aspirin is higher than previously found for
drugs considered potentially inappropriate in elderly pa-
tients, which have been estimated to cause approximately
0.06 ED visits per 1000 outpatient prescription visits (95%
CI, 0.03-0.08).40,41 Although these potentially inappropri-
ate medications have been widely incorporated into nu-
merous patient safety and quality initiatives, including na-
tional measures of prescribing safety,42-44 few, if any,
measures are currently available that identify patients re-
ceiving DAT as being at high risk for AEs.45 Because the
role of clopidogrel plus aspirin is expanding in the pri-
mary and secondary prevention of thromboembolic dis-
orders, incorporation of DAT into patient safety measures
that identify this combination as an important contribu-
tor to serious AEs will be important.
Fewpopulation-basedstudieshavereportedontherates
of hemorrhage with DAT. Most of these studies17,46-49 were
conducted in single centers and focused on specific pa-
tient populations (eg, after myocardial infarction) or evalu-
ated DAT combined with oral anticoagulation therapy pri-
marily in patients undergoing coronary stenting. Direct
comparisonofthepresentfindingswiththoseofthesestud-
ies is made difficult by the heterogeneity of data sources
and bleeding definitions used and by the patient popula-
tions and indications for DAT under study. Likewise, few
data are available from clinical trials that have prospec-
tively compared specific hemorrhagic risks of DAT with
those of warfarin.10,50-52 A recent pooled analysis52 of ran-
domized controlled trials of secondary stroke prevention
estimated total bleeding rates to be 10.1% with clopido-
grel plus aspirin therapy vs 16.8% with anticoagulation
therapy and annualized major bleeding rates (defined by
the authors as any bleeding necessitating hospital admis-
sion) to be 1.7% with clopidogrel plus aspirin therapy vs
2.5%withanticoagulationtherapy.Inthemostrecentclini-
cal trials10,11 of DAT in patients with AF at high risk for
stroke, major bleeding rates for DAT were 2.0% to 2.4%
per year. Rates of major bleeding with DAT in these pa-
tient populations were not statistically significantly differ-
ent than those with warfarin.10
This study's findings should be interpreted in the con-
text of the limitations of public health surveillance data.
First, regarding ED visit data, information on medical his-
tory is limited in the NEISS-CADES project, so all pa-
tients, regardless of indication for antithrombotic therapy,
aspirin dose,53 or other known hemorrhage-related risk
factors, were included in this analysis. Second, because
these data are based on ED record review, medication his-
tory may be incomplete; however, omission of antiplate-
let medication or warfarin during the workup for an ED
visit involving hemorrhage or evaluation for potential
hemorrhage is likely minimal. Third, comparisons of ED
visits for epistaxis, skin, or other minor hemorrhages be-
tween DAT and warfarin therapy may have been af-
fected by the fact that patients receiving warfarin are more
likely to have longer durations of treatment (eg, lifelong
treatment in patients with AF) relative to patients re-
ceiving DAT (eg, 12-month treatment after percutane-
ous coronary intervention). For this reason, patients re-
ceiving warfarin may be more familiarized with minor
hemorrhages and less likely to seek ED treatment for such
hemorrhages than may patients undergoing DAT. Re-
gardless, this does not negate the substantial contribu-
tion of these types of hemorrhages to the overall burden
of ED visits from DAT.
Regarding prescription data, first, it is possible that as-
pirin use was underreported in patient medical histories
givenitsover-the-counterstatus;however,thisismuchless
likely for patients who have a clinical indication for DAT
compared with patients who are receiving aspirin mono-
therapy as primary or secondary prevention for other car-
diovascular indications. Also, a large percentage of over-
the-counter medications are captured during physician
office, hospital outpatient department clinic, or ED visits
that compose the NAMCS/NHAMCS samples.54 Second,
NAMCS/NHAMCS prescription estimates exclude tele-

phone and e-mail contacts and prescriptions initiated in
nursing homes, in ambulatory surgery centers, and dur-
ing hospitalizations or provided at hospital discharge,22
which may explain why the present estimates of warfarin
prescribing are lower than what has been reported in other
ambulatory prescription data sources.18 Assuming that the
NAMCS and the NHAMCS underestimate prescription vis-
its equally and in the same direction for clopidogrel plus
aspirin and for warfarin, and because these analyses relied
largely on the relative risks of ED visits per outpatient pre-
scription visits, we would expect this bias in the number
of ambulatory prescriptions to minimally affect the con-
clusions about the magnitude of DAT-related hemor-
rhagic risk relative to that of warfarin. Third, outpatient
prescriptionvisitsareacrudemeasureofexposureforcom-
paring warfarin use (likely associated with frequent fol-
low-up outpatient visits) with clopidogrel plus aspirin use
(likely associated with fewer follow-up outpatient visits).
However, reporting the number of AEs relative to the num-
ber of ambulatory care visits at which DAT or warfarin was
prescribed or continued provides good context forthe risks
that DAT imparts with every patient encounter.
The beneficial role of DAT is well established in pa-
tients with acute coronary syndromes and may poten-
tially expand to a subset of patients with AF. Ultimately,
for each patient, the hemorrhagic risk associated with DAT
will be determined by his or her specific demographic
and clinical risk factors, underlying diagnosis, treat-
ment setting, and quality of clinical care. Broadly, how-
ever, these nationally representative findings on AEs in-
dicate that the hemorrhagic risk of clopidogrel plus aspirin
therapy is substantial and suggest a need to approach that
risk with vigilance. The high frequency of minor hem-
orrhages with clopidogrel plus aspirin suggests that ef-
forts targeted at educating patients to anticipate and rec-
ognize such events so as to optimize patient adherence
to therapy will be important.
