Both ancient and recent polyploidy, together with post-polyploidization loss of many duplicated gene copies,
complicates angiosperm comparative genomics. To explore an approach by which these challenges might be
mitigated, genetic maps of extant diploid and tetraploid cottons (Gossypium spp.) were used to infer the approximate
order of 3016 loci along the chromosomes of their hypothetical common ancestor. The inferred Gossypium gene order
corresponded more closely than the original maps did to a similarly inferred ancestral gene order predating an
independent paleopolyploidization () in Arabidopsis. At least 59% of the cotton map and 53% of the Arabidopsis
transcriptome showed correspondence in multilocus gene arrangements based on one or both of two software
packages (CrimeStatII, FISH). Genomic regions in which chromosome structural rearrangement has been rapid
(obscuring gene order correspondence) have also been subject to greater divergence of individual gene sequences.
About 26%­44% of corresponding regions involved multiple Arabidopsis or cotton chromosomes, in some cases
consistent with known, more ancient, duplications. The genomic distributions of multiple-locus probes provided early
insight into the consequences for chromosome structure of an ancient large-scale duplication in cotton. Inferences
that mitigate the consequences of ancient duplications improve leveraging of genomic information for model
organisms in the study of more complex genomes.

The generally more-rapid evolution of gene arrangement in an-
giosperms (flowering plants), relative to other higher eukaryotes
such as animals, appears to be at least in part due to polyploidy
and its consequences (Bowers et al. 2003). Polyploidy may result
from the merger of more than one genome from species whose
chromosomes can pair and recombine (autopolyploidy), or from
species with divergent chromosomes that normally do not pair
or recombine (allopolyploidy). It has long been suspected, based
on differences among taxa in chromosome number and size, that
many angiosperm genomes may have undergone ancient poly-
ploidization (Stebbins 1966). Bearing out early hints based on
parallel arrangements of duplicated DNA marker loci (Kowalski et
al. 1994; Paterson et al. 1996), the demonstration of large-scale
duplication in the Arabidopsis genome (The Arabidopsis Genome
Initiative 2000; Blanc et al. 2000; Paterson et al. 2000), its reso-
lution into multiple events (Vision et al. 2000; Simillion et al.
2002; Bowers et al. 2003), and the dating of a subset of these
events to near () or before () the monocot­dicot divergence
suggest that virtually all angiosperms are paleopolyploids (Bow-
ers et al. 2003).
Burgeoning genomic data are revealing that not only do
most angiosperms share a few ancient whole-genome duplica-
tions, but many have also undergone more recent lineage-
specific duplications. For example, a duplication detected in the
rice sequence (Goff et al. 2002; Paterson et al. 2003) is shared by
the major cereals but not by more distant monocots such as Musa
(banana) and Allium (Paterson et al. 2004). Recent investigations
of large numbers of ESTs suggest genomic duplications in many
additional lineages (Blanc and Wolfe 2004). The curious failure of
this EST-based approach to validate the rice duplication suggests
that such methods underestimate the extent of genomic dupli-
cation, for reasons that are not yet understood.
Better understanding of polyploidy and its consequences are
central to comparative biology. Traditional models (Ohno 1970)
suggest that polyploidy may free one duplicated gene copy to
evolve new function, with the fitness of the organism buffered by
the second copy. However, several recent findings are at odds
with this model, in particular, the reduced species-wide polymor-
phism levels associated with recently duplicated genes in Arabi-
dopsis (Moore and Purugganan 2003) and the long period for
which duplicated genes retain partially redundant functions (Gu
et al. 2003). Theoretical considerations suggest that the fates of
duplicated genes are closely associated with effective population
size (Ne
) for a taxon (Lynch and Conery 2003). Thus, insights
from microbes such as yeast with large Ne
may not extend well to
crown eukaryotes with small Ne
.
The high frequency of duplications (especially in compari-
son to dioecious organisms such as most animals) and experi-
mental facility of angiosperms, together with their much smaller
Ne
than yeast, make them attractive models for dissecting the

evolutionary consequences of polyploidy in higher eukaryotes.
These consequences may have many dimensions--for example,
patterns of distribution of QTLs within a nucleus, across taxa,
and across environments (Jiang et al. 1998; Wright et al. 1998;
Ming et al. 2001), together with intricate patterns of organ-
specific reciprocal expression silencing (Adams et al. 2003) all
suggest that nonlinear interactions between duplicated genes
and genomes may contribute novel attributes to some polyploid
crops.
The complicated genome structure that results from re-
peated cycles of genome duplication, each followed by loss of
one member of many duplicated gene pairs ("diploidization"--
[Eckardt 2001b]), adds much complexity to deciphering the evo-
lutionary history of plants. Understanding the relative relation-
ships between taxon divergence and genome duplication is es-
sential to making truly orthologous comparisons among
angiosperm genomes (Kellogg 2003). Such information adds a
powerful new tool to help resolve the fates of individual genes
and gene family members by more definitive determination of
orthology and more precise links between gene duplication and
taxon divergence than have been realized using molecular clock-
based methods.
Gossypium (cotton) is an especially appropriate system in
which to explore the comparative genomics of paleopolyploids.
While the cereals have often been preferred models for angio-
sperm comparative genomics, the relative lack of knowledge of
non-Poaceae monocots is presently a hindrance in studying an-
cient genomic duplications. The Malvales (including cotton) are
presently the nearest relative to Arabidopsis outside of the Bras-
sicales, for which a detailed genetic map has been described.
Dating of the  event to after the cotton-Arabidopsis divergence
assures that the two lineages differ by at least this ancient dupli-
cation event (Bowers et al. 2003). Cultivated cottons are tetra-
ploids of relatively recent (ca. 1 Mya) origin from A- and D-
genome diploid ancestors that may themselves have shared com-
mon ancestry about 10 Mya (Cronn et al. 2002; Wendel and
Cronn 2003). Colinearity among these genomes has been well
characterized (Rong et al. 2004). Further, the A- and D-genomes
share common gametic chromosome number (13) with all six
other genome types in the genus (B, C, E, F, G, K). That several
related genera have many species with n = 6 has long hinted at
the possibility of ancient duplication in the cotton lineage, how-
ever, solid evidence of such an event or its consequences has
been lacking. Finally, the cotton-Arabidopsis comparison offers
practical benefits--research into the genetic control of the seed-
borne epidermal fibers that account for most of cotton's eco-
nomic importance may benefit greatly from progress in under-
standing the growth and development of hair-bearing epidermal
cells (trichomes) in Arabidopsis (Larkin et al. 2003; Schiefelbein
2003). The recent discovery that a cotton Myb could rescue an
Arabidopsis gl1 mutant, and also induce seed trichome produc-
tion in Arabidopsis (Wang et al. 2004) is particularly exciting.
As a further step toward unraveling the complexities that
polyploidy introduces into comparative genomics, we explore in
detail the comparative chromosome structural evolution of Gos-
sypium and Arabidopsis. Detailed genetic linkage maps of the tet-
raploid and D-diploid cotton genomes (Rong et al. 2004) are used
to infer the probable arrangement of mapped genes in a hypo-
thetical common ancestor, mitigating both the consequences of
diploidization and the inability of genetic mapping studies to
detect DNA polymorphism at all duplicated loci. Analysis of this
inferred gene order substantially improves the degree of corre-
spondence in gene arrangement detected between the hypotheti-
cal ancestors of cotton and Arabidopsis. The first insights into
structural genomic consequences of an ancient whole-genome
duplication in cotton are revealed. This work points the way to
more effective leveraging of genomic information from botanical
models in the study and improvement of major crops, and im-
proved understanding of mechanisms underlying botanical di-
versity.
Results
Inferring gene order along the chromosomes of the
hypothetical ancestor of the A and D genomes of Gossypium
To improve our ability to identify intragenomic duplication in
cotton, existing genetic maps (Rong et al. 2004) were supple-
mented with 147 new DNA markers that were likely (based on
Southern blot data) to detect two or more duplicated loci in a
highly polymorphic cross between diploids G. trilobum and G.
raimondii, adding 290 new segregating loci. This yielded a total of
1243 loci from the At subgenome (i.e., the 13 tetraploid chromo-
somes derived from an A-genome diploid ancestor), 1218 loci
from the Dt subgenome (the 13 tetraploid chromosomes derived
from a D-genome diploid ancestor), and 1014 loci from the D
diploid genome (Supplemental Table 1).
A total of 781 probes were mapped to two or more loci in
cotton. Alignments among homoeologous At, Dt, and D chro-
mosomes were readily established based on 333 pairs of loci ar-
ranged in extensive blocks with corresponding order and orien-
tation. An additional 87 pairs of loci revealed blocks of corre-
sponding order but opposite orientation (reflecting inversions).
Homoeologous reference loci were used as a framework to inter-
polate the probable locations of additional markers that could be
mapped in only a subset of the homoeologs. In the vast majority
of cases, this reflects lack of genetic polymorphism. Even in in-
terspecific crosses, per-locus polymorphism rates in tetraploid
cotton are modest (e.g., Rong et al. 2004), and the likelihood of
finding polymorphisms at each of two homoeologous loci is
small.
Several lines of evidence show that gene loss per se is infre-
quent in the At and Dt genomes. First, the vast majority of cDNA
or other low-copy probes detect multiple "alloallelic" restriction
fragments in tetraploid cotton, which comigrate with fragments
in diploid progenitors (Reinisch et al. 1994). In a survey of 40
gene pairs based on high-resolution SSCP, 100% of the 40 genes
studied were represented in tetraploid cotton by two homoeolo-
gous copies (Adams et al. 2003), suggesting a rate of gene loss that
is no more than 2.5%. Lack of rearrangement following poly-
ploid synthesis in cotton (Liu et al. 2001) and identical gene
composition along corresponding At and Dt cotton BACs
(Grover et al. 2004) support this view. While we cannot preclude
the possibility of occasional gene loss, all available evidence
points to it playing a minor role in the inability to map homoe-
ologs in tetraploid cotton.
In the absence of appreciable gene loss, the same principles
that apply to the inference of nonpolymorphic sites across the
At, Dt, and D genomes are appropriate for inference of approxi-
mate gene arrangement along the chromosomes of their hypo-
thetical common ancestor. To infer the probable gene order
along the chromosomes of a hypothetical common ancestor of
the At, Dt, and D genomes, the Dt genome was used as the pri-

mary map into which the other maps were merged. We chose Dt
as the reference map because (1) it is virtually collinear with the
D diploid map, in contrast to extensive rearrangement of the At
genome relative to its A ancestor (Brubaker et al. 1999), and (2)
because the Dt map had 20% more markers than the D diploid
map so less inference is necessary. All
common colinear loci within the same
homoeologous group were used as an-
chor loci to start the construction of
consensus maps by simple interpolation
based on the relative spacings of nonan-
chor loci between consecutive anchors.
The D map was merged into the Dt map
first, followed by the At map, with the
exception of chromosome ends (from
the end to the first or last common
marker). For regions that differed by in-
version, marker locations were interpo-
lated based on the Dt order (Fig. 1A,B;
Supplemental Fig. 1; Table 1).
Differences in polymorphism asso-
ciated with terminal markers may cause
the respective maps to have somewhat
different coverage of their respective
chromosomes. As a best estimate of the
coverage of the respective maps, we con-
sidered the centiMorgan length of the
respective maps from the last common
marker to the terminus. If the ends of
the At or D maps were longer than the
corresponding segments of the Dt map,
the longer segment was used as the pri-
mary map for the affected end. The Dt
map was the longest for only three chro-
mosomes (2, 4, 6), thus, the maps of the
other 10 chromosomes are therefore
somewhat longer than the Dt map
(Supplemental Fig. 1; Table 1). To deal
with translocations between tetraploid
(At) Chrs. 2 and 3, and 4 and 5, the af-
fected chromosomes were split, with the
appropriate regions merged into differ-
ent D genome homologs (Supplemental
Table 1). To implement the rules that we
outline above for inferring the approxi-
mate gene arrangement along the chro-
mosomes of a hypothetical common an-
cestor of the At, Dt, and D genomes, a
computer program was written in PHP.
In partial summary, we assembled
13 maps representing the inferred gene
orders along the chromosomes of the
hypothetical common ancestor of the A
and D genomes of Gossypium. Each con-
sensus map was named according to the
name of the diploid D genome chromo-
some, but with the prefix C ("consen-
sus"). The inferred map of the hypo-
thetical ancestral cotton chromosomes
included 3016 loci, spanning 2324.7 cM,
with the largest gap being 14.5 cM
(Table 1).
Cotton sequences having Arabidopsis homologs
A total of 2162 (92.5%) of probes detecting 2800 (92.8%) of loci
in the inferred ancestral cotton map could be sequenced (Table 1;
Supplemental Table 1). Among these, 1738 (62.1%) of the se-

were used to interpolate the probable locations of additional markers (e.g., M1/M2) that could be
mapped in only a subset of the homoeologs (for details, see Methods). (B) Consensus map of cotton

and green represented inverted regions on diploid D and At chromosomes, respectively, compared
with the inferred map. The vertical ellipses highlighted with blue represent possible locations of
centromeres, inferred as described elsewhere (Rong et al. 2004). Superscripted numbers in parenthe-
ses indicate centiMorgan locations that could not be shown between major gridlines on the map due

the centiMorgan locations indicated (parentheses), due to space.

quenced loci had one or more unambiguous homologs in the
Arabidopsis genome based on 7437 BLAST matches that met a
threshold of E < 1010 (listed in Supplemental Table 2). A total of
1005 cotton loci matched 3106 Arabidopsis genes that fell within
30 genes of one another along the inferred pre- gene orders, and
thus, were considered tandem or proximal duplicates likely to
have arisen by illegitimate recombination and/or transposition.
Similarly, 386 Arabidopsis genes matched pairs of cotton loci <5
cM apart, which were also considered proximal duplicates (the
rationale for setting these proximity thresholds are in Methods).
To avoid the detection of false correspondence based on multiple
matches to proximal duplications, only one member of these
groups of genes was kept for further analysis. Removal of 2305
proximal duplicates from the match file left 5132 matching pairs
that were considered "potential orthologs" and used in compara-
tive analyses.
Distribution of Arabidopsis putative orthologs along inferred
ancestral cotton chromosomes
The distribution of best-matching Arabidopsis sequences on in-
ferred ancestral cotton chromosomes was not random. Among
1720 pairs of neighboring cotton loci, 220 (12.8%) corresponded
to genes from the same Arabidopsis -duplicated segment
(Supplemental Table 2), significantly (P = 3.02  1063) more
than the 75 explicable by chance, if cotton genes were ran-
domly distributed across the 34 -duplicated segments that col-
lectively comprise 89% of the Arabidopsis genes. In addition, 143
(8.3%) pairs of loci corresponding to genes from the same Arabi-
dopsis-duplicated segment(s) were separated by only one conflict-
ing locus (corresponding to a different Arabidopsis duplicated seg-
ment), significantly higher than the 71 explicable by chance
(P = 1.14  1017).
Inferred ancestral Arabidopsis gene arrangement shows more
conserved synteny with cotton than modern Arabidopsis gene
order
To explore the extent and distribution of conserved synteny be-
tween cotton and Arabidopsis, two software packages, CS2 and
FISH (each described in the Methods), were each used to analyze
the 5132 pairs of "potential orthologs." CS2 and FISH, respec-
tively, detected 187 clusters, including 800 pairs of matching loci
and 310 blocks, including 715 pairs of matching loci. Details of
corresponding regions are summarized in Supplemental Tables 3
and 4 and presented in full in Supplemental Table 2.
To explore the consequences of duplication/diploidization
in Arabidopsis for genomic comparisons, we compared the in-
ferred ancestral cotton map with both the modern Arabidopsis
genome and with inferred pre--duplication Arabidopsis gene or-
ders (Bowers et al. 2003). When CS2 was used for comparison of
cotton to the modern Arabidopsis genome, 270 (33.8%) of the
800 pairs of matching loci no longer occurred in clusters, reflect-
ing gene loss in modern Arabidopsis chromosomes following the
 event. As an example (Fig. 2), a region of 31.1 cM with 67 loci
was selected from C06. Among 39 cotton loci that had homologs
in Arabidopsis, 24 showed conserved synteny with pre- duplica-
tions, but only 17 with modern Arabidopsis. Using the inferred
ancestral Arabidopsis gene order increases the detection of con-
served synteny, so it was used in further studies.
Patterns of conserved synteny between cotton and Arabidopsis
While both CS2 and FISH revealed cotton-Arabidopsis correspon-
dence between many common regions, there were also notewor-
thy differences in reciprocal comparisons that used cotton
(Supplemental Table 3) or Arabidopsis (Supplemental Table 4) as
the foundation. Based on evaluation of matching loci in their
distribution along the cotton chromosomes, CS2 detected corre-
spondence over nearly twice as much of the genome as FISH,
both in total and along each chromosome. Most regions detected
by CS2 were larger than, and inclusive of the regions detected by
FISH, excepting regions determined with only two pairs of
matching loci (CS2 requires at least three matching pairs for sig-
nificance). Overall, a total of 1372.1 cM, or 59.0% of the cotton
consensus map, showed nonrandom correspondence, putatively
synteny, with at least one Arabidopsis -duplicated segment
based on CS2. Different cotton chromosomes varied in the por-
tion over which correspondence could be inferred, from 81.1%
for C05 to 40.4% for C10 (Supplemental Table 3).
In most cases (81.1% with CS2, 96.8% with FISH), a single
genomic region in the hypothetical ancestral cotton map corre-
sponded to only one to two Arabidopsis-duplicated segments.

These percentages varied among chromosomes--for example,
over 80% of correspondence on C01 and C10 involved only one
Arabidopsis  region, while on C03, nearly 70% of correspon-
dence involved two or more Arabidopsis regions. Evaluation of
putative orthologs (as described above) in their distribution
along the Arabidopsis genome (measured in the number of genes
along the segments) also showed much correspondence with cot-
ton (detailed in Supplemental Table 4). Segments of Arabidopsis
pre- gene orders covering 12,402 genes (53.5%) showed corre-
spondence with the cotton consensus map using CS2. Again,
FISH detected lower correspondence (27.8% of the Arabidopsis
transcriptome) across the whole genome, and on all but three
individual pre- segments (01, 17, S07).
Ancient duplication in the cotton
genome since its divergence from a
common ancestor shared with
Arabidopsis
Previously (Rong et al. 2004), we noted
some hints of segmental duplication
within individual cotton subgenomes.
We further investigated this in two
ways. First, 39,079 ESTs for G. arboreum
(a diploid A-genome genotype) were as-
sembled into unigene sets using Phrap
with minmatch 20, minscore 100, and
repeat stringency 0.95. Next, genes
(ESTs) were blasted against one another,
and the synonymous substitution rate
for the best-matching sequence was cal-
culated using standard methods. This
yielded a marked peak at a Ks value of
about 0.45 (Fig. 3), suggestive of a large-
scale duplication about 15­30 Mya, de-
pending on the neutral substitution rate
used (Gaut et al. 1996; Koch et al. 2000).
In either case, this is too recent to be
shared with Arabidopsis, in that the cot-
ton and Arabidopsis lineages appear to
have diverged no later than 83­86 Mya
based on evidence from fossilized pollen
(Benton 1993). A second peak at about
Ks
1.5 may perhaps reflect the Arabidop-
sis  event, but needs further investiga-
tion. Similar patterns of distribution of
Ks
values were recently reported by oth-
ers (Blanc and Wolfe 2004).
To explore the consequences of
possible paleopolyploidy of cotton at
the level of chromosome structure, loci
that were duplicated on nonhomoeolo-
gous chromosomes and/or within the
same subgenome were mapped to each
of their multiple locations on the in-
ferred ancestral map and identified by
the addition of a lower-case letter at the
end of the probe name (Fig. 1; Supple-
mental Fig. 1; Supplemental Table 1).
FISH and CS2 were used to analyze the
distribution of these multiple loci. CS2
showed correspondence over 1200.1 cM,
or 51.8% of the genome, more than
twice the correspondence detected with FISH (564.1 cM, 24.3%:
Supplemental Table 5; Fig. 4). Individual corresponding regions
detected with CS2 were generally larger and often included the
regions detected by FISH (Supplemental Table 5; Fig. 4). Indi-
vidual chromosomes varied widely in the portion for which cor-
respondence to other parts of the genome could be identified,
from 7.4% (C10 with FISH) to 68% (C02 with CS2).
Both FISH and CS2 suggested occasional correspondence of
individual regions of one subgenome to multiple regions of the
other, an observation that on the surface may indicate still more
ancient duplication events in the cotton lineage. However, such
associations are suspect in that they accounted for a dispropor-
tionately large share of the incongruities between inferences

other duplications, or no synteny. Duplicated Arabidopsis genes contributing to assembly of inferred
gene orders were linked with dashed lines.

made using the two packages. Overall, the lengths of correspond-
ing regions on individual chromosomes as estimated by CS2 ver-
sus FISH were significantly correlated with one another, but only
at a modest level (r = 0.28). There was very strong agreement
(r = 0.51) in the portions of individual chromosomes that
matched only one other region of the genome. However, there
was virtually no relationship between the two packages
(r = 0.017) in portions matching two other regions. Higher-order
matches lacked adequate data for meaningful comparison. A
one-to-one relationship was indicated for 50% and 74% of the
corresponding regions by CS2 and FISH, respectively. As illus-
trated in Figure 4, the number of corresponding regions, in par-
ticular those detected by CS2, appears to be related to marker
density of the consensus map. Postulated centromeric regions
appear to be especially high in both marker density and CS2-
inferred correspondence among chromosomal segments. How-
ever, we question whether the multiple associations among chro-
mosomes in these regions truly represent conserved synteny--
other work in our group (Bowers et al. 2005) has suggested that
intercentromeric gene movement may be associated with evolu-
tion of bivalent chromosome pairing in recently formed poly-
ploids. We speculate that such gene movement may cause CS2 to
falsely infer conserved syntenies. More information is needed to
carefully evaluate this hypothesis, in particular, the exact loca-
tions of all cotton centromeres (which are presently approxi-
mated). However, at present, we remain cautious of these multi-
chromosomal associations, and suggest that the more stringent
FISH algorithm may better represent true synteny (or lack
thereof) in these regions.
Further improving the detection of conserved synteny
between cotton and Arabidopsis
The combination of cotton segments showing paleo-
homoeology with one another appears likely to further improve
the identification of conserved synteny between cotton and Ara-
bidopsis. Two corresponding chromosomal segments from C05
and C09, respectively (Fig. 5), show six corresponding loci in
collinear order (Gate2BC05, pAR0050, Gate4CD03, Unig26C03,
pAR0945, and Gate2DH05), except for an inversion between
pAR0945 and Gate2DH05 at the ends of two chromosome seg-
ments. If a consensus gene arrangement is constructed from the
two segments, additional conserved syntenies are identified. For
example, when each cotton segment was considered separately,
no one showed conserved synteny with 03 on Arabidopsis chro-
mosome 1. But, when the two cotton homoeologous segments
are merged, correspondences to two new portions of 03 are
identified (Fig. 5). Based on a consensus arrangement inferred
from interleaving the two segments, a total of 11 additional Ara-
bidopsis segments showed correspondence, with a maximum of
two corresponding to the same cotton region. Sufficient data to
apply this approach on a genome-wide scale in cotton may
greatly extend the length of chromosomal segments over which
conserved synteny can be inferred.
Discussion
The relatively close relationship of cotton and Arabidopsis, de-
tailed genetic map for cotton, and potential importance of using
functional genomic information and tools from Arabidopsis to
aid in dissecting economically important pathways in cotton
make this system an excellent case study for exploring compari-
sons of gene order among divergent taxonomic families. The
inferred map of 3016 loci spanning 2324.7 cM in the genome of
a hypothetical common ancestor of the A and D Gossypium ge-
nomes, by itself, is a valuable tool for a wide range of applica-
tions. Due to the modest levels of DNA polymorphism among
modern (AD) polyploid cottons, we can genetically map both
members of a homoeologous gene set in only about 20% of cases,
even using interspecific crosses. The inferred map predicts the
locations of the remaining 80% of homoeologs that cannot be
mapped in any one cross, resolving many incongruities between
maps of different tetraploid species (which often segregate for
polymorphic alleles at different homoeologs). The inferred map
is an excellent resource from which markers can be selected for
marker assisted selection, identification of introgression lines,
QTL mapping, and SNP discovery using sensitive new techniques
that permit identification of informative DNA marker alleles in
sequence-tagged sites such as these that had previously been
mapped as RFLPs. A growing number of such studies have been
done or are in progress (Jiang et al. 1998, 2000a,b; Wright et al.
1998, 1999; Saranga et al. 2004).
The inferred ancestral map is especially important for link-
ing the tetraploid cotton genetic map to emerging BAC-based
physical maps, in that it mitigates not only the omission of
monomorphic loci, but also any gene loss associated with "dip-
loidization" subsequent to AD polyploid formation. Most of the
mapped sequences have been used to anchor high-coverage bac-
terial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries of G. hirsutum, G. bar-
badense, and G. raimondii (see http://www.plantgenome.uga.edu/
cotton/CottonDBFrames.htm), the latter of which is also being
completely fingerprinted (http://www.plantgenome.uga.edu/
projects.htm#Cotton). This will permit us to resolve more pre-
cisely the true arrangements of loci that are too closely linked to
order with confidence based on genetic recombination.
The inferred ancestral map of cotton, together with similar
pre- Arabidopsis gene orders, far surpassed the usefulness of
comparisons made between extant Arabidopsis and cotton gene
orders to reveal conserved synteny. Cotton and Arabidopsis may
have shared a common ancestor about 83­86 Mya (Bowers et al.
2003), only about 20­30 Myr before the divergence of the cereals
that are often considered models for comparative genomics. In-
stances of synteny or collinearity have been identified (Eckardt
Figure 3. Patterns of DNA sequence similarity mong G. arboreum ESTs.
By analyses described in the text, similarity among best-matching se-
quences shows a marked peak at a K
s
value of about 0.45, suggestive of
a large-scale duplication about 15­30 Mya, depending on the neutral
substitution rate used (Gaut et al. 1996; Koch et al. 2000).

2001a) even for species that are thought to have diverged from
Arabidopsis as much as 100 Mya or more (Paterson et al. 1996; Ku
et al. 2000; Mayer et al. 2001; Rossberg et al. 2001; Salse et al.
2002) based largely on sequenced BACs or other large DNA frag-
ments. However, to the degree that gene loss followed poly-
ploidization events in these lineages, these studies chronically
underestimated the degree of conserved synteny that existed
(Bowers et al. 2003; Kellogg 2003). These issues are at least partly
mitigated by the comparison of the inferred ancestral cotton map
and the pre- Arabidopsis gene order, which permits us to identify
conserved syntenies between individual cotton chromosomes and
typically three to five Arabidopsis -duplicated segments (Fig. 5).
Herein, we begin the process of unraveling the conse-
quences of an ancient duplication so far only known in the Gos-
sypium genus, beginning to reveal the sizes and locations of du-
plicated regions. Growing evidence suggests that historical esti-
mates of the role of paleopolyploidy in angiosperm evolution
(Stebbins 1966) were underestimates, and that the evolutionary
history of all angiosperm genomes includes one or more cycles of
polyploidization (Bowers et al. 2003; Blanc and Wolfe 2004). Our
findings in cotton were foreshadowed by classical cytogenetic
studies (Muravenko et al. 1998) hinting that the ancestors of
cultivated allotetraploid cotton experienced polyploidization
events that far predate the formation of modern allotetraploids
in the Pleistocene. Wendel and Cronn (2003) systematically re-
viewed the research results in this area and proposed that present
AD-genome allotetraploids are likely to be at least paleooctaploid.
Much remains to be done. While we have found tentative
correspondence of segments covering about half of the genome,
we must assume that many small rearrangements within these
segments have escaped detection by the coarse resolution af-
forded by the (albeit relatively large) number of genetically
mapped DNA markers in hand. Additional genetic information
and eventually genomic sequence will further clarify the prob-
able patterns of gene arrangement that predated this duplication
in the cotton lineage.
Although we have concentrated in this work on duplication
events that occurred more recently than the divergence of the
cotton and Arabidopsis lineages from a common ancestor, the
effects of still more ancient duplications shared by the lineages
are also evident. In several cases, different Arabidopsis -dupli-
cated segments matching the same cotton region corresponded
to one another as a result of more ancient  or  duplications
found by Bowers et al. (2003) (Supplemental Table 2). For ex-
ample, the cotton chromosomal region shown in Figure 2 mainly
corresponded with 11 and 14, except for two loci having con-
served synteny with 20. The loci showing conserved synteny
between C06 and four members of these two  duplications were
largely collinear on both cotton and Arabidopsis chromosomes.
From Bowers et al. (2003), the homoeologous regions of 11 and
14 are both thought to derive from the more ancient gene order
called 4.
The true properties of the "other half" of the genome, in
which we have not yet found even early evidence of ancient
duplication, remain to be clarified. For many of these we may
simply have too little information to discern a "signal" of struc-
tural conservation from among the many factors that may con-
tribute noise to this data set. However, genomic regions in which
chromosome structural rearrangement has been rapid (leaving
no conserved synteny), appear also to have been subject to rapid
divergence of individual gene sequences. In analysis of potential
orthologs with FISH and CS2, 802 (46.1%) detected nonrandom
correspondence, putatively conserved synteny between cotton
and Arabidopsis (Table 1; Supplemental Table 2). To evaluate their
patterns of distribution across the genome, the consensus maps
were subdivided into bins of 10 cM in length. While all chromo-
somes (ranging from 89.5% to 95.1%: Table 1) and most bins
(Fig. 6) contained very similar proportions of sequenced loci, the
percentage of loci showing putative synteny with Arabidopsis was
highly variable. We further plotted the percentage of loci for
which an Arabidopsis homolog could not be identified (Table 1).
There was a strong negative correlation (r = 0.57) between the
percentage of loci (per bin) showing conserved synteny with Ara-
bidopsis, and the percentage of loci showing no match in Arabi-
dopsis. This indicates that different genomic regions may tolerate
rearrangement at different rates, a hypothesis that has previously
been suggested based on the failure to identify ancient duplica-
tions in centromeric regions of both Arabidopsis and rice. A fas-
cinating question for further study is whether such rapidly evolv-
ing regions contain a disproportionate share of genes that ac-
count for morphological or physiological divergence between
taxa, including reproductive isolation.
Ongoing improvement of analytical tools may also help to
better resolve long-range comparative data. The main difference
between CS2 and FISH is the method by which individual points
in the data matrix are taken as evidence for conserved synteny. In
CS2, Euclidean distance was used and if points are spatially close
enough, they will be flagged as correspondence. This algorithm
may thus be especially prone to false positives in regions of the
genome in which low recombination per unit physical distance
results in high marker cosegregation and inability to resolve true
orders of genes along the chromosome. As we noted, CS2 tended
to detect more correspondence and longer segments in marker-
rich genomic regions, but multiple associations in these regions
appear likely to include some false positives. In contrast, in FISH,
Manhattan distance was used and only the points close enough
to meet likelihood thresholds and also in a roughly diagonal line
are taken as evidence of correspondence. However, deviations
from such a diagonal may be caused by a number of factors. For
example, localized inversions (Grant et al. 2000; Vision et al.
2000; Salse et al. 2002) are relatively frequent and often cause
recently arisen deviations from an overall pattern of ancient cor-
respondence. Further, in comparisons of genetic maps to se-
quences (or transcript maps as done herein), differences between
recombinational and physical distances will again cause devia-
tions from the diagonal. Finally, with relatively sparse data from
genetic maps, many corresponding segments may only be com-
prised of the minimal set of three (CS2) or even two (Brownstein
et al. 2003) data points. These factors motivated our decision to
compare the two different algorithms. While the ultimate solu-
tion to these limitations will be to sequence the underlying ge-
nomes, in the meantime, many investigators may reap much
benefit from botanical (or other) models in advancing the study
of a wide range of additional genomes by careful consideration of
the consequences of paleopolyploidy, using these or other ap-
proaches.

somes, reported by Rong et al. (2004), were used in the construc-
tion of the inferred ancestral cotton map. A total of 290 new loci
were added to the D genome map since publication of the prior
map. The probes, procedures, and population used for mapping
these new loci were as reported by Rong et al. (2004).
It was previously noted that many probes detected multiple
polymorphic loci (Rong et al. 2004). Many of the duplicates were
distributed at collinear locations on the At, Dt, and D chromo-
somes, respectively, permitting us to identify homoeologous
groups of At, Dt, and D chromosomes. Inferred ancestral maps
were assembled from the chromosomes of a homoeologous
group by using common colinear loci for alignment. The Dt ge-
nome was used as the primary map to which the other maps were
merged into. The D map was merged first, followed by the At
map, with the exception of chromosome ends (from the end to
the first common marker). If the ends of the At or D maps were
longer than the corresponding fragments of the Dt map, the
longer fragment was used as the primary map for the mapping of
this end (Fig. 1A). While this imposes modest bias in the recom-
binational lengths of terminal regions, it was necessary to accom-
modate the likelihood that the longest terminal interval covers
more chromatin than the others. If the markers are in a collinear
order, but in the opposite direction, the order on the Dt chro-
mosome was used. Loci that are duplicated on the homoeologous
chromosomes but not in collinear order, or on nonhomoeolo-
gous chromosomes, are identified by the addition of a lower-case
letter at the end of the probe name in the consensus map. Rela-
tive spacing along the consensus map of the loci in regions be-
tween two consecutive markers shared by At or D and Dt are
calculated as follows:
M2 = (M1  Y1)/(X1  Y1)  (X2  Y2) + Y2.
Here, M is the marker located on At or D and intended to be
merged into the inferred map. M2 is the relative location (dis-
tance from the top of the inferred maps, cM) of the marker (M) in
the inferred map (Fig. 1A). M1 is the original location of marker
M on At or D. Y1 and Y2 are the location (distance from the top
of the each homoeologous chromosome, cM) of the first com-
mon marker (Y) on the At (or D) and inferred map, respectively.
X1 and X2 are the location of the second common marker (Y) on
the At (or D) and inferred map, respectively. To efficiently build
the inferred map according to the rules and formula mentioned
above, a Web-based computer program was compiled using
PHP. The code of the program is available at http://www.
plantgenome.uga.edu/MapMerger/.

Computer software
The FISH (Calabrese et al. 2003) and CrimeStatII (Levine 2002)
software packages were both used to identify putatively dupli-
cated genomic regions within the hypothetical ancestral cotton
genome, as well as putatively corresponding regions between cot-
ton and Arabidopsis. Both packages treat single locus matches
between a pair of genomes as point features that occur in a two-
dimensional grid. The problem of identifying significant regions
of colinearity between two genomes is thus reduced to the prob-
lem of finding significant clusters of points in Euclidean space.
FISH was designed for Fast Identification of Segmental Ho-
mologs (Calabrese et al. 2003). FISH preprocesses the matched
locus data between two genomes to enforce symmetry and re-
move noise from the data set, and then identifies sets of neigh-
bors. A dynamic programming algorithm is then used to follow a
trace-back path that picks the string of neighbors that will yield
the maximally extended block. To be considered neighbors by
FISH, the Manhattan distance

where m = number of points, n = number of cells, and T = the

FISH under the assumption that each cell contains a

The CS2 package was developed by Ned Levine and Associ-
ates (Levine 2002) under funding from the National Institute of
Justice and has been made freely available for educational and
research purposes (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/
crimestat.html). Although initially developed for the analysis of
crime-occurrence data, the package performs measurements of
central tendency, spatial autocorrelation, and hot-spot analysis
that can be applied to any spatial data set. Interoperability with
existing GIS programs such as ArcView (http://www.esri.com)
and integrated Dynamic Data Exchange protocols make CS2 a
flexible tool for both analyzing and visualizing spatial datasets.
This package has proven to be useful to scientists studying spatial
patterns in ecology (Worrall et al. 2004) epidemiology (Brown-
stein et al. 2003), and cellular biology (Fuss and Linn 2002) and
could prove to be a powerful tool for assessing spatial patterns in
genomic data sets.
One CS2 tool useful to genomics is the nearest neighbor
hierarchical clustering analysis, which provides a means of de-
lineating significant clusters of points in Euclidean space. This
tool identifies clusters by finding nearest neighbors that are sepa-
rated by a Euclidean distance

that is less than a minimum threshold distance. This threshold
distance is defined to be a one-tailed confidence interval around
the expected random values for distance to nearest neighbors
such that,

where A is the Area being surveyed, N is the number of sampled
incidents, and t is the t-value associated with a probability level
from the Student's t-distribution. These nearest neighbor sets are
joined into hierarchical clusters with a minimum size and prob-
ability level set by the user. CS2 will accept cluster sizes as low as
two points, and can join points with probability values ranging
from P = 0.00001 up to P = 0.999. The output from this analysis
is a text file identifying points and their cluster association, as
well as an ellipsoid shape file that may be exported to ArcView for
visualization of the distribution of clusters.
Identification of ancient duplications in the hypothetical
cotton ancestor
Excluding the collinear anchor loci used in the construction of
consensus maps, many duplicated loci were found at nonhomoe-
ologous locations. To evaluate whether these reflected ancient
whole-genome or large-scale duplication in the hypothetical an-
cestor, these loci were analyzed with FISH and CS2. For FISH, all
markers were arranged in their recombinational order along the
map, with co-segregating markers arranged alphabetically (i.e.,
arbitrarily) at a locus. A total of 13 map files were established,
with one file per chromosome. Match files are composed of pairs
of loci from the same probe (named as matching loci). A total of
169 match files (13  13) were created for FISH analysis, using
the following parameters: minimum block size, 2 (default is 3);
minimum bit score, 200 (as default); T, 0.05 (as default).
For CS2, the same set of match data as in FISH was used.
Instead of the marker name used in the above match files, the
accumulated distances from Chromosome 1 (C01) to C13 were
calculated and used as the locus name for all chromosomes. Only
one file was therefore created for all 13 chromosomes and is
composed of two columns, numbers in each column represent-
ing one of the matching loci. The first column was displayed as
the x-axis and the second as the y-axis. CS2 analysis used the
following parameters: minimum points (pairs of matching loci)

per cluster, three; number of standard deviations for ellipses, one;
simulation runs, 0. The likelihood was set to 1%.
The lengths of conserved syntenic blocks were estimated by
calculating the distance between the delimiting markers in the
block detected by FISH or in the cluster detected by CS2.
Arabidopsis gene duplication database
Assembly of inferred ancestral gene orders along duplicated seg-
ments in the Arabidopsis genome is described elsewhere (Bowers
et al. 2003). Briefly, a total of 26,028 Arabidopsis gene sequences
were downloaded from NCBI, encoded by their chromosomal
order and transcriptional orientation, and compared with each
other using BLASTP. A total of 23,172 genes were shown to be in
duplicated regions and grouped into 34 nonoverlapping chromo-
somal segments. Name and linear order of these 23,172 genes in
the assembled duplications was explained by Bowers et al. (2003)
and can be found at http://www.nature.com/nature or http://
www.plantgenome.uga.edu/ploid.html.
Cotton probe DNA sequencing and BLAST search against
Arabidopsis sequence database
Mapped cotton probes were sequenced as reported by Rong et al.
(2004) and listed in Supplemental Table 1. Cotton sequences as
query were compared with Arabidopsis gene sequences by search-
ing all 26,028 genes in the Arabidopsis sequence database using
BLASTX. Here, cotton query sequences are DNA sequences and
Arabidopsis are translated protein sequences. The top 10 matches
that met a threshold of E < 1010 were used for further analysis.
Evaluation of conserved synteny between cotton and
Arabidopsis
Both FISH and CS2 were also applied in the analysis of conserved
synteny between cotton and Arabidopsis, and the same param-
eters used as in the identification of ancient duplication in the
hypothetical cotton ancestor. Cotton-mapping data used here
was the same as that in the identification of cotton ancient du-
plication by CS2 with the following modifications. The location
of a given marker was determined by the accumulated locus
number along chromosomes instead of the accumulated genetic
distance. The marker location for a given marker was standard-
ized by multiplying the marker location of a given locus by the
ratio of the total Arabidopsis gene number to cumulative cotton
gene number. This was based on the assumption that cotton and
Arabidopsis have a similar gene number. This was done so that
the two genomes could be aligned on x- and y-axes and direct
comparisons made in CS2 and have the same chance to be com-
pared in FISH.
Similarly, all 34 Arabidopsis  duplications were combined
consecutively into a single unit in ascending order of the dupli-
cate segment numbers (in the nomenclature of Bowers et al.
2003). The location of a given Arabidopsis gene was assigned as
the accumulated gene number. In order to avoid bias from proxi-
mal duplicated genes on the estimation of conserved synteny
between cotton and Arabidopsis, the distance (gene number)
among the top 10 Arabidopsis matches to each cotton query se-
quence were calculated before running FISH and CS2. If the best
matches were <30 genes apart along the Arabidopsis duplicated
segment, we tentatively considered the genes to be proximal du-
plicates, and only one gene from such groups was kept for further
analysis. The middle gene in the proximal duplicates was kept
because it was the best representative of all proximal genes. If
there was an even number of genes in the proximal duplication,
the first of the middle two genes was kept. We used the number
30 because it was statistically unlikely (5%) that more than one
match fell in an interval of this size by chance, even allowing
consideration of the top 10 matches. Similarly, if a single Arabi-
dopsis gene matched multiple cotton loci <5 cM apart, we
counted only a single match.
