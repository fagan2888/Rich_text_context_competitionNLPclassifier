Abstract
Activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 and heat-shock protein
90/heat-shock factor-1 signal-transduction pathways plays a central role in combatting cellular oxidative damage and related
endoplasmic reticulum stress. Electrophilic compounds have been shown to be activators of these transcription-mediated
responses through S-alkylation of specific regulatory proteins. Previously, we reported that a prototype compound (D1, a
small molecule representing a proelectrophilic, para-hydroquinone species) exhibited neuroprotective action by activating
both of these pathways. We hypothesized that the para-hydroquinone moiety was critical for this activation because it
enhanced transcription of these neuroprotective pathways to a greater degree than that of the corresponding ortho-hydro-
quinone isomer. This notion was based on the differential oxidation potentials of the isomers for the transformation of the
hydroquinone to the active, electrophilic quinone species. Here, to further test this hypothesis, we synthesized a pair of para-
and ortho-hydroquinone-based proelectrophilic compounds and measured their redox potentials using analytical cyclic
voltammetry. The redox potential was then compared with functional biological activity, and the para-hydroquinones demon-
strated a superior neuroprotective profile.

Introduction
Living tissues and their associated cells maintain a deli-
cate balance between reductive and oxidative processes to
survive. Perturbation of this homeostatic redox balance is
thought to significantly contribute to various disorders,
including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (Hara
and Snyder, 2007; Satoh and Lipton, 2007; Bredesen,
2008; Kim et al., 2008; Nakamura and Lipton, 2009).
Recently, considerable attention has focused on electro-
philic and proelectrophilic drugs (PEDs) as well as their
related analogues because of their ability to activate cel-
lular defense systems (Satoh et al., 2006; Calabrese et al.,
2010; Groeger and Freeman, 2010; Satoh et al., 2013).
PEDs such as carnosic acid (CA; Figure 1) are natural
products found in herbs such as rosemary and sage
(Aruoma et al., 1992; Satoh et al., 2008a, 2008b).
In addition, related natural product-inspired hydroqui-
none-based synthetic compounds (i.e., D1 and D3;
Figure 2) have recently been reported by our team and
were shown to be bioactive (Satoh et al., 2011).

Importantly, CA and D1 (Figure 1), examples of PEDs,
themselves are not electrophilic until they are activated at
a site of tissue injury undergoing oxidative stress (Satoh
et al., 2011).
PED activation under conditions of oxidative stress
occurs because quinone formation is influenced by the
cellular redox state, and in particular the Cu2þ/Cuþ
recycling system (Wang et al., 2010; Satoh et al., 2013).
Figure 1. Chemical structures of the proelectrophiles evaluated in this study. The present study highlights compounds D1 (a) and D3 (b).
CA (d) was evaluated as a neuroprotective compound in prior studies and is used here as a reference compound (Satoh et al., 2008a,
2008b). The compound notated as D2 (c) served as an inactive negative control for D1 in previous studies (Satoh et al., 2011). Note that
D1 and D2 are para-hydroquinone isomers, while D3 and the natural product CA are ortho-hydroquinone isomers. CA ¼ carnosic acid.
Figure 2. CV of D1 (red line) and D3 (blue line) recorded in 0.1 M (Bu)4
NClO4
in acetonitrile (100 mV/s scan rates), with corresponding
anodic peak (Ep
an), cathodic peak (Ep
cat), and half-wave (E1/2
) potentials. Upon oxidation, the compounds adopt the oxidized quinone forms
in a two-electron process. Both para- and ortho-hydroquinones are converted to electrophilic quinones, but the meta-hydroquinone isomer
is not converted. Para- and ortho-hydroquinones, but not meta-hydroquinone, can activate the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway (Satoh and Lipton,
2007; Satoh et al., 2013). CA ¼ carnosic acid; Nrf2 ¼ nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2.

The redox-active transition metal copper can catalyze
oxidative activation of a number of phenolic compounds
via Cu2þ/Cuþ cycling (Bensasson et al., 2008; Satoh et al.,
2009; Wang et al., 2010; Johansson, 2012). Under normal
conditions, PED hydroquinones are very slowly oxidized
to the quinone form, whereas this rate is greatly increased
in the presence of Cu2þ/Cuþ recycling (Wang et al., 2010;
Satoh et al., 2013). In addition, after conversion to the
active form, PEDs display superiority to classical antioxi-
dant molecules because of their sustained action and
amplification via the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived
2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and heat-shock factor-1 (HSF-1) tran-
scription-mediated signaling pathways (Satoh et al.,
2013). These dynamic processes afford the potential for
generating a pathologically activated therapeutic (or
PAT) drug (Lipton, 2004, 2006, 2007). Importantly, we
have also shown that several PEDs display an excellent
absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity,
and pharmacokinetic profile in the central nervous
system, making them strong drug candidates (Satoh
et al., 2008a; Rezaie et al., 2012; Satoh et al., 2013).
First, we focused on the Kelch-like ECH-associated
protein 1 (Keap1)/Nrf2 pathway as one of the targets
of PEDs for neuroprotection (Satoh et al., 2008b, 2011,
2013). After conversion to electrophilic quinones, PEDs
activate the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway (Satoh and Lipton,
2007; Satoh et al., 2008b, 2013). We have shown that it
is possible to take advantage of this intracellular mech-
anism of electrophilic activation to develop a novel strat-
egy for drug development against neurodegenerative
diseases. As an illustration, CA activates the Nrf2 tran-
scriptional pathway and protects various cells and organs
against redox stress (Takahashi et al., 2009; Kosaka et al.,
2010; Mimura et al., 2010; Tamaki et al., 2010; Maruoka
et al., 2011; Satoh et al., 2011; Rezaie et al., 2012;
Yanagitai et al., 2012). We have developed a potential
strategy for clinical translation of this work based on
the following chemical principles (Satoh and Lipton,
2007; Satoh et al., 2013).
1. Novel PEDs and related analogues are better tolerated
than electrophiles, in part because electrophilic com-
pounds can deplete glutathione in healthy, unstressed
cells (Bensasson et al., 2008; Satoh et al., 2009; Wang
et al., 2010; Johansson, 2012).
2. PEDs combat the oxidative stress that converts them to
electrophiles through activation of the Nrf2 pathway
(Bensasson et al., 2008; Satoh et al., 2009; Wang et al.,
2010; Johansson, 2012).
Second, we focused on the heat-shock protein
(HSP)90/HSF-1 pathway as one of the targets of PEDs
for neuroprotection (Satoh et al., 2011, 2013). HSP90/
HSF-1 (Zou et al., 1998; Morimoto, 2008; Takii et al.,
2010), like Keap1/Nrf2 (Talalay, 2000; Itoh et al., 2004;
Zhang et al., 2011), provides cell protection through acti-
vation of endogenous gene networks involved in antioxi-
dant response element (ARE) defense (Satoh and Lipton,
2007; Satoh et al., 2013). Several activators of Nrf2 via
reaction with Keap1 also covalently bind to cysteine resi-
dues of HSP90 to activate HSF-1 and other HSPs (Satoh
et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011) through binding to AREs
and heat-shock factor response elements (HSE), respect-
ively, to provide neuroprotection against oxidative and
nitrosative insults (Satoh et al., 2011; Zhang et al.,
2011). Thus, S-alkylation of critical cysteine residues by
electrophilic compounds can activate both of these tran-
scriptional pathways, representing what has been called
an electrophilic counterattack response (Satoh et al.,
2006; Satoh and Lipton, 2007; Groeger and Freeman,
2010; Satoh et al., 2013). Because the capacity of neurons
to protect themselves from redox insults can be easily
overwhelmed, such backup systems are important
homeostatic regulation processes that insure the continu-
ation of normal neuronal signaling (Satoh et al., 2006;
Satoh and Lipton, 2007; Groeger and Freeman, 2010;
Satoh et al., 2013). D1 is a novel proelectrophilic com-
pound that activates both the Nrf2 and HSF-1 pathways
and can thus protect against both oxidative and endo-
plasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Satoh et al., 2011; Zhang
et al., 2011).
Importantly, potential clinical relevance for the use of
PEDs in vivo has been obtained in models of age-related
macular degeneration (AMD; Rezaie et al., 2012; Satoh
et al., 2013) and cerebrovascular disease (stroke; Satoh
et al., 2008b). While antioxidants were generally believed
to have some effect in preventing AMD, their actions are
fairly marginal (Prasad, 2009; Cano et al., 2010;
Ramkumar et al., 2010). The use of antioxidants is not
very effective because tissue penetrance is not reliable and
often the action is not sustained. Similarly, while tissue
plasminogen activator can dissolve clots, no effective neu-
roprotective treatment has been proven for stroke
damage in the brain (Satoh et al., 2008a, 2008b). Most
importantly, the novel PEDs, such as D1 described in this
article, increase the chances of producing clinically toler-
ated therapeutics because they are only changed to the
active state by oxidative insult at the site of impending
injury (Satoh et al., 2013).
Based on these inherent attributes and the potential
clinical relevance of PEDs, we investigated their effects
on various types of cell lines. For example, because of the
potential involvement of oxidative stress in AMD, we
used the human apical retinal pigment epithelial cell
line, ARPE-19 (Wada et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2003;
Mandel et al., 2009). Because of the potential involve-
ment of oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease, vascular
dementia, and stroke, we used the mouse hippocampal
cell line, HT-22 (Hara and Snyder, 2007; Satoh and
Lipton, 2007; Bredesen, 2008; Kim et al., 2008;
Satoh et al. 3
Nakamura and Lipton, 2009). Glutamate may be directly
toxic to cultured neuronal cells via two different processes
(Tan et al., 1998; Sagara et al., 2002). The first pathway is
mediated by glutamate receptors. The second pathway is
activated by a reduction in intracellular glutathione
levels, leading to an imbalance in the homeostasis of
the cell's redox state (Tan et al., 1998; Sagara et al.,
2002). This second pathway can be blocked by the add-
ition of antioxidants. In particular, glutamate toxicity of
HT22 cells has been used to model oxidative stress-
induced cell death in hippocampal neurons (Tan et al.,
1998; Sagara et al., 2002).
The objective of this study was to determine which
isomer (para- vs. ortho-hydroquinone) could provide max-
imal activation of the Nrf2/ARE and HSF-1/HSE path-
ways. We sought to combine chemical and biological
perspectives on this issue to define the best chemical struc-
ture of an electrophilic core for use as a PED. To test the
para-hydroquinone electrophilic core of D1 versus an iso-
meric ortho-analogue, we synthesized compound D3 (the
ortho-hydroquinone variant of D1) having the same chem-
ical scaffold (Figure 1). We then compared the para- and
ortho-forms in terms of chemical and biological actions by
monitoring oxidation potential, transcriptional activa-
tion, induction of phase 2 enzymes and HSPs, as well as
protection against oxidative and ER stress.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Antibodies
Antibodies and reagents were obtained as follows: anti-
heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) polyclonal rabbit IgG
(OSA-150, Assay Design, Ann Arbor, MI), anti-
NADPH quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1) polyclonal
rabbit IgG (2618-1, Epitomics, Cambridge, MA), anti-
HSP70 monoclonal mouse IgG (200-301-A27,
Rockland, Pottstown, PA), IRDye 800CW goat anti-
rabbit (green fluorescent; LI-COR, Lincolon, NE,
catalogue number 926-32211), and IRDye 680LT goat
anti-mouse (red fluorescent; LI-COR, Lincolon, NE,
catalogue number 926­68020). Other reagents including
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), sodium glutamate, fluores-
cein diacetate (FDA), hydrogen peroxide (HP), tunica-
mycin (TM), and Hoechst 33 258 stain were obtained
from Sigma (St Louis, MO). The chemical synthesis of
D1 has been described previously (Satoh et al., 2011).
Synthesis of analogues D1 and D3 are described later.
General Procedure for the Synthesis of Compounds,
D1 and D3
To a 20-ml microwave vial was added methyl 10-bromo-
decanoate (1.0 equiv.) and triphenylphosphine (2.0
equiv.). The mixture was placed under an argon
atmosphere and subjected to heating via microwave
irradiation at 100C for 45 min. The resulting mixture
was then cooled to room temperature, followed by add-
ition of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF; 10 ml) and
mild heating and vortexing until a solution was formed.
To the resulting phosphonium salt solution was then
added 1.0 M sodium bis-trimethylsilylamide (1.0 equiv.)
dropwise over a 1-min period. This mixture was stirred at
0C in an ice/brine bath for 45 min followed by addition
of the corresponding ortho- or para-dimethoxybenzalde-
hydes (1.48 M in THF). The reaction was allowed to pro-
ceed, with stirring, at room temperature over 16 hr. The
reaction product was then concentrated and reconstituted
in 20 ml of ethyl acetate (EtOAc)/water (50/50 v/v), after
which the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was
extracted with EtOAc (3 Â 8 ml) and combined with the
organic layer, and the mixture was then dried over
MgSO4
. The product was subsequently filtered, concen-
trated, and subjected to SiO2
flash column chromatog-
raphy (Biotage SP4 system, Uppsala, Sweden) using 5%
to 18% EtOAc to afford the olefinic esters as a colorless
oils (46%­68%). These intermediates were used directly
in the next step.
To a 5-ml round-bottom flask containing the mixed
olefinic ester intermediates was added anhydrous metha-
nol (0.1 M) followed by addition of 10% Pd/C (0.1
equiv.). The reaction was placed under a hydrogen
atmosphere and stirred vigorously for 16 hr. After such
time, the mixture was filtered through a plug of celite/
SiO2
and concentrated to yield the crude aliphatic ester
in quantitative yield. To the crude ester were added equal
amounts of THF and 2 M LiOH(aq)
solution (4 equiv.),
and this mixture was then stirred at 40C overnight. The
reaction product was concentrated, dissolved in EtOAc,
and then acidified (to pH 1­2) via addition of 1 N HCl.
The layers were separated, and the acidic aqueous layer
was extracted three times with EtOAc. The combined
extracts were dried over Na2
SO4
, filtered through a
SiO2
solid phase extraction cartridge, and concentrated
to yield the crude acids affording colorless oils. The oils
were diluted through addition of anhydrous CH2
Cl2
and
cooled to À78C in a dry ice/acetone bath. To this solu-
tion was added 1 M BBr3
(2.1 equiv.) in CH2
Cl2
, and this
mixture was allowed to gradually return to room tem-
perature over a period of 4 hr. Thereafter, the tempera-
ture was reduced to 0C. The reaction was quenched with
deionized water and extracted three times with EtOAc.
The combined extracts were dried over Na2
SO4
, filtered
over celite, and concentrated. The crude product was dis-
solved in methanol and subjected to purification via pre-
parative liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry using
mass-directed fractionation. Combined fractions were
concentrated using a Biotage V-10 evaporation system
to afford compounds D1 or D3 as white/off-white solids
(20%­35% isolated yield over three steps).

Cyclic Voltammetry Experimental Protocol
All experiments were performed using an electrochemical
analyzer (CH Instruments, Austin, TX, model 600 E),
glassware (cells), hardware, and electrodes (glassy
carbon working, platinum counter, Ag/AgCl reference).
All glassware was cleaned with concentrated nitric acid
and rinsed with deionized water prior to experimentation.
Prior to and between cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans, the
glassy carbon electrode was polished with 0.05-micron
alumina, the platinum wire auxiliary electrode was
cleaned in 0.1 M H2
SO4
, and the Ag/AgCl reference elec-
trode was stored in 1.0 M KCl. All substrates were pre-
pared as 1 mM solutions in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium
perchlorate in anhydrous acetonitrile and degassed under
argon for 10 min prior to and between CV scans. Anodic
and cathodic potentials were recorded after at least 10
cycles to insure reproducibility, except for resorcinol,
which was recorded for the first cycle due to rapid current
decrease upon subsequent cycles (Nasr et al., 2005;
Astudillo et al., 2007; Nematollahi and Mohammadi-
Behzad, 2009).
Cell Culture (ARPE-19 Cells)
To study the biochemistry and molecular biology of oxi-
dative stress in retina, several investigators have used
in vitro culture of ARPE-19 cells. For example, exposure
of ARPE-19 cells to HP is known to induce apoptosis and
has thus been used as an in vitro model of retinal degen-
eration triggered by oxidative stress (Satoh et al., 2011).
The cells were maintained in 10-cm dishes containing
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supple-
mented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were intro-
duced into wells of a 24-well plate at a density of 1 Â 105
cells/cm2 and incubated for 24 hr. The medium was then
changed to serum-free medium containing the designated
concentrations of the test compounds, and the cultures
were incubated for 24 hr. Then, HP or TM was added,
and the cells were incubated for 4 hr or 24 hr, respectively.
Finally, the cells were stained with FDA (1 mM) and
Hoechst 33258 (5 mg/ml) and observed by epifluorescence
microscopy.
Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction
For reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-
PCR) analysis, total RNA was obtained by use of
TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) from
ARPE-19 cells that had been incubated with vehicle
(DMSO), D1 (5 mM), or D3 (5 mM) in serum-free
medium for 24 hr (Satoh et al., 2000, 2003; Sasaki et al.,
2011, 2013). Total RNA (1 mg) from each source was
exposed to Superscript III (Invitrogen) in the presence
of RNasin (20 U), random hexamers (2.5 mM), dNTPs,
and the supplied reverse transcription buffer. The reac-
tion (20 ml) was allowed to continue for 15 min at 42C. A
volume of 1/100th of this mixture from each source was
then subjected to PCR conducted with the appropriate
primer sets. At completion of the PCR, 10 ml of the PCR
products were mixed with 2 ml of loading buffer, and this
mixture was electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gel in the
presence of 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide. The amplified
DNA fragments were visualized with UV detection.
RT-PCR analysis was performed as described previ-
ously (Satoh et al., 2000, 2003; Sasaki et al., 2011, 2013)
with the following primers (number of PCR cycles and
size of PCR product in parentheses):
50-TGA CTG ACT ACC TCA TGA AG-30 (F) and
50-TTG CCA ATG GTG ATG ACC TG-30 (R) for b-actin
(22 cycles, 202 bp);
50-GAG TTG CAG CTG CTG AG-30 (F) and
50-GCA TGC CTG CAT TCA CAT G-30 (R) for ho-1 (24

50-CTC CAT GTA CTC TCT GCA AG -30 (F) and
50-GTG GTG TCT CAT GAG TGT GC -30 (R) for nqo1 (30
cycles, 203 bp); and
50-AGA TTC ATG ACG TCG TCC TG-30 (F) and
50-GGA TGC CAT TAG CAT CAA TG-30 (R) for hsp70 (28
cycles, 468 bp).
Western Blot Analysis
ARPE-19 cells were incubated for 24 hr with vehicle
(DMSO), D1 (5 mM), or D3 (5 mM) in 10-cm dishes con-
taining serum-free DMEM (Satoh et al., 2000, 2003;
Sasaki et al., 2011, 2013). The cells were lysed in buffer
(M-PER mammalian protein extract reagent, catalog
Satoh et al. 5
#78503, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented
with a protease inhibition cocktail (Complete Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets; catalog #11836170001,
Roche, Waltham, MA). Total cell lysates (10 mg each)
were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and then transferred onto polyvinyli-
dene fluoride membranes. HO-1, NQO1, HSP70, and gly-
ceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were
detected with specific antibodies, and the signals were
detected using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibo-
dies. The protein signals were enhanced by use of a
chemiluminescence assay (ECL Western blotting;
Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ).
Luciferase Assay
We used pGL-GSTYa ARE core-luciferase (Satoh et al.,
2008, 2011) and ptK-hHSP70-luc (Takii et al., 2010) for
assessment of transcriptional activation via ARE and
HSE, respectively. ARPE-19 cells were seeded at a dens-
ity of 1 Â 105 cells/cm2 into wells of a 48-well plate con-
taining 1 mg of plasmid DNA plus Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen), and then incubated for 5 hr in PBS contain-
ing 1 mg of plasmid DNA plus Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). The cells were then washed in PBS and incu-
bated for another 24 hr with vehicle, D1 (5 or 10 mM), or
D3 (5 or 10 mM). Firefly luciferase activity in cell lysates
was measured with a luminometer for reporter gene
assays (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection efficiency
was normalized to b-galactosidase activity assessed by co-
transfection with pSV-b-gal (Promega). For reporter gene
assays, cells were transfected with 1 mg of the reporter
construct (pGL-GSTYa ARE core-luciferase or ptK-
hHSP70-luc) and 0.2 mg pSV-b-gal for 1 hr. Cells were
then washed in PBS and incubated in serum-free culture
medium for another 24 hr with vehicle, D1 (5 or 10 mM),
or D3 (5 or 10 mM). Firefly luciferase activity and b-galac-
tosidase activity in cell lysates were measured by using a
luciferase system and b-galactosidase enzyme assay
system, respectively (Promega).
Culture of HT22 Cells
Mouse hippocampal HT22 cells were maintained in
10-cm dishes containing DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal calf serum (Satoh et al., 2000, 2003; Sasaki
et al., 2011, 2013). The cells were seeded onto 24-well
plates at a density of 8 Â 104 cells per well in 500 ml of
serum-containing DMEM. One hour after seeding, the
cultures were incubated for 1 hr with vehicle (DMSO)
or various concentrations of D1 or D3. One hour later,
the cells were exposed to 5 mM glutamate for 24 hr to
induce oxidative damage. Subsequently, viability of the
HT22 cells was determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-
2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction,
as described elsewhere (Satoh et al., 2000, 2003; Sasaki
et al., 2011, 2013). Cell death was also measured by the
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity detection kit
(TAKARA, Otsu, Shiga, Japan), which quantitatively

Redox State of Compounds
The redox behavior of D1 and D3 was analyzed using CV
in solution. Their voltammograms were compared with
that of 1,2-dihydroxybenzene (catechol), 1,3-dihydroxy-
benzene (resorcinol) and 1,4-dihydroxybenzene (hydro-
quinone), which were measured as control compounds
in parallel to that of D1 and D3 (Nasr et al., 2005;
Astudillo et al., 2007; Nematollahi and Mohammadi-
Behzad, 2009). The CVs of catechol and hydroquinone
were recorded in theÀ0.5 V to 1.5 V potential range
versus Ag/AgCl, where one anodic peak (oxidation to
quinone form) and one cathodic peak (reduction back
to the hydrogenated form) are observed. Table 1 sum-
marizes the potential values for all compounds. Redox
processes in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate in
acetonitrile electrolyte are not reversible because the
anodic and cathodic peaks are separated by over
600 mV. This was expected and consistent with values
reported in the literature for these substrates/electrolyte
combinations, and in particular hydroquinone is

confirmed to oxidize more readily than catechol by 0.1 V.
The CVs of resorcinol show only one oxidation peak at
0.3 V to 0.4 V higher potential than the other two isomers,
which is consistent with the lack of electron delocaliza-
tion on the nonconjugated meta-substitution pattern of
the molecule (Nasr et al., 2005; Astudillo et al., 2007;
Nematollahi and Mohammadi-Behzad, 2009). The CVs
of the oxidation processes of D1 and D3 are shown in
Figure 2. The anodic peak for D1 is found at 1.01 V, and
that of D3 is recorded at 1.13 V. With cathodic peaks at
0.21 V and 0.40 V, respectively, the half-wave potentials
for D1 and D3 are at 0.61 V and 0.77 V. This is consistent
with the values found for the hydroquinone and catechol
model compounds (Table 1 and Figure 1) and confirms
that all redox processes involving the oxidation of D1
occur at 0.1 V to 0.2 V lower potentials than D3, that is,
D1 is oxidized more readily than D3.
Activation of the Nrf2 and HSF-1 Pathways
We hypothesized that D1 activated Nrf2 and HSF-1
more than D3 based on the redox potential and ease of
oxidation to the cysteine-reactive quinone form. To con-
firm this notion, we performed luciferase assays in
ARPE-19 cells transfected with plasmid DNAs under
the transcriptional control of the ARE or HSE
(Figure 3). D1 (5 mM) significantly activated both tran-
scriptional elements, indicating that D1 can stimulate
both the ARE and HSE systems. In contrast, the ortho-
isomer D3 (5 mM) activated the Nrf2/ARE pathway to a
lesser extent than that of the para-isomer. At 10 mM,
D1 was still more potent than D3. D3 at 10 mM but not
5 mM activated the HSE transcriptional element. These
observations are consistent with the notion that
the para-isomer (D1) activates the Keap1/Nrf2 and

medium was changed to serum-free medium containing vehicle (DMSO) versus D1 or D3 (5 mM or 10 mM). Cell lysates were obtained after
24 hr incubation and subjected to the luciferase assay. Values are the mean Æ SD; *p <.05. ARE ¼ antioxidant response element; HSE ¼

HSP90/HSF-1 pathways more effectively than the ortho-
isomer (D3).
Induction of Phase 2 Enzymes
We hypothesized that the biological activity of com-
pounds D1 and D3 would be closely related to their abil-
ity to activate the Nrf2/ARE pathway. The previous
DNA microarray study showed that compound D1
induced expression of HSPs in addition to phase 2
enzymes. Incubation with D1 resulted in activation of
Nrf2 and HSF-1 transcriptional elements, thus inducing
phase 2 enzymes and HSPs, respectively (Satoh et al.,
2011). In this manner, D1 protected neuronal cells from
both oxidative and ER-related stress. First, in this article,
to compare the induction of the genes encoding phase 2
enzymes and HSPs by 5 mM D1 and D3, we performed an
RT-PCR analysis using primers for the ho-1 and nqo1
phase 2 genes, and for hsp70 and hsp90 (Figure 4(a)).
D1 significantly induced each of these genes, although
the magnitude of induction varied from gene to gene.
Induction by D3 was significantly weaker than that by
D1. Next, we confirmed the induction of HO-1, NQO1,
and HSP70 at the protein level by performing immuno-
blot analysis (Figure 4(b)). D1 induced HO-1 in a dose-
dependent manner, whereas D3 did so only weakly, as
confirmed by quantitative analysis (Figure 4(c)). While
D1 and D3 induced the expression of NQO1 and
HSP70 proteins, the basal levels of expression were
already high in this cell line. Taken together, these data
suggest that D1 induced both phase 2 enzymes and HSPs
both more potently and efficaciously than D3.
Protective Effects in ARPE-19 Cells
An important biological attribute of PEDs is that they
offer protection from oxidative stress (Satoh and Lipton,
2007; Satoh et al., 2013). Thus, we examined whether D1

could protect neuronal cells against oxidative stress
(Figure 5). As an in vitro model of cell death related to
AMD (Wada et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2003; Mandel et al.,
2009), we exposed ARPE-19 cells to HP (1 mM) for 4 hr
in serum-free medium (Figure 5(a) and (b)). In our stu-
dies, we found that ortho-D3 was about twofold less
potent than para-D1.
In addition to oxidative stress, we hypothesized that
PEDs could also render cells resistant to ER stress by
inducing HSPs, as shown previously (Satoh et al.,
2011). Hence, we tested if the addition of D1 could pro-
tect ARPE cells from ER stress elicited by 3 mM TM. As
shown in Figure 5(c) and (d), exposure to TM (3 mM)
induced cell death, but D1 (2-5 mM) provided significant
protection. D3 was also effective against both oxidative
and ER stress, but proved to be a less potent proelectro-
philic analog. In addition, although compound D3
afforded protection against TM, it did not activate the
HSE. One possibility is that Nrf2 can induce HSPs in
addition to phase 2 enzymes without affecting the HSE
(Satoh et al., 2011).
Protective Effects in HT22 Cells
To confirm that para-D1 exhibited more potent neuro-
protection than ortho-D3, we undertook an additional
series of experiments examining neuronal cell death in
the face of oxidative stress. We examined the protective
effects of D1 and D3 against oxidative glutamate toxicity
in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells. In these cells, high

concentrations of glutamate induce cell death through
depletion of glutathione, which is caused by inhibition
of the glutamate-cystine antiporter (Satoh et al., 2008a,
2008b). We performed both the MTT assay for cell sur-
vival and LDH release assay for cell death. D1 signifi-
cantly protected cells against oxidative glutamate
toxicity, whereas D3 was less potent, as assessed by
MTT assay (Figure 6(a)). Again, ortho-D3 was about
twofold less potent than para-D1. These protective effects
were confirmed by the LDH release assay (Figure 6(b)).
Discussion
In the present study, we compared the chemical and bio-
logical effects of ortho- and para-PEDs in providing neu-
roprotective activity. We performed a series of
biochemical experiments, measuring oxidation potential,
transcriptional activation, induction of phase 2 enzymes
and HSPs, and neuroprotection, to compare the com-
pounds D1 and D3, which share similar chemical struc-
tures except that they are para- and ortho-hydroquinones,
respectively. The para-electrophilic compound D1 acti-
vated neuroprotective signaling pathways to a greater
degree than the ortho-compound D3. These results are
consistent with our CV experiments showing that the
sequence of oxidation potential modulation for theses
isomers is para (hydroquinone) > ortho (catechol) > >
meta (resorcinol) as shown in Table 1. We
consistently found that the oxidation potential for
the para-hydroquinone D1 was lower than that of the
ortho-hydroquinone D3 (Figure 2). Overall, the para-
compound exhibited at least a twofold increase in the
potency of neuroprotection over the ortho-compound.
Whether this improvement will be reflected when para-
versus ortho- compounds are compared in in vivo disease
models remains to be determined in future studies.
In terms of developing clinically tolerated drugs, we
sought to learn principles from other recent ventures in
successful central nervous system drug development.
Along these lines, our development of the FDA-approved
drug memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor
antagonist, was in part based on the principle that
drugs should interact with their target only during
states of pathological hyperactivation and not during
normal physiological function (Lipton, 2004, 2006,
2007). Drugs that have been developed using this strategy
are designated PAT drugs. PEDs are candidate PAT
drugs because conversion to the active quinone form is
redox-controlled and thus enhanced by the very oxidative
stress that these drugs then counteract (Satoh and Lipton,
2007; Satoh et al., 2008b, 2013). Moreover, in terms of
their druggability, published work has shown that these
PEDs can translocate into the retina and brain of mice
and rats at levels sufficient to protect against significant

oxidative insults, including light-induced retinal degener-
ation and middle cerebral artery occlusion (Satoh and
Lipton, 2007; Satoh et al., 2008b, 2013).
Overall, our results support the notion that compound
D1 activates both Nrf2 and HSF-1, while compound D3
activates these pathways less potently. Moreover, the
measured electrochemical oxidation potentials of these
PEDs can be used to predict their activation of protective
pathways. The differential ability of PEDs to activate the
transcription factors in these pathways is inversely corre-
lated to their potential for oxidation from the hydroquin-
one to the quinone form (Figure 7). Importantly, the
redox state of the cells also affects the ability to transform
PEDs to their active quinone form. The Cu2þ/Cuþ redox
system regulates oxidative reaction from hydroquinone to
quinone (Satoh et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010), and this
system is highly influenced by the availability of electron
acceptors in the cell; under pathological conditions, such
electron acceptors are represented by reactive oxygen spe-
cies (Satoh et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010). Redox state-
dependent regulation of quinone formation dictates that
PEDs, such as CA and D1, are PATs in the sense that
they are converted from the hydroquinone to the quinone
by the very reactive oxygen species that they then combat
via transcriptional activation (Lipton, 2004, 2006, 2007).
Accordingly, activated PEDs S-alkylate critical cysteine
residues on KEAP1 and HSP90, leading to activation of
the transcription factors Nrf2 and HSF-1, respectively
(Satoh et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011). This approach
thus represents a novel strategy against neurodegenera-
tive disorders, providing disease-modifying electrophilic
drugs in the context of pathological insult.
For many years, the herb rosemary has been reported
to manifest antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity.
We have previously shown that CA, present in rosemary
extract, crosses the blood­brain barrier to exert neuro-
protective effects by upregulating endogenous antioxi-
dant enzymes via the Nrf2 transcriptional pathway
(Rezaie et al., 2012; Satoh et al., 2013). The antioxidant
and neuroprotective activities in retinal cell lines exposed
to oxidative stress and in a rat in vivo model of light-
induced retinal degeneration suggest that PEDs, such as
D1 and CA, may potentially have clinical application to
retinal diseases, including AMD and retinitis pigmentosa,
in which oxidative stress is thought to contribute to dis-
ease progression (Rezaie et al., 2012).
In conclusion, our findings suggest that para-hydro-
quinones are both more potent and efficacious than their
ortho-hydroquinone homologues in terms of transcrip-
tional activation, induction of phase 2 enzymes and
HSPs, and neuroprotective effects against oxidative and
ER stress. Nonetheless, other factors that determine
druggability, such as pharmacokinetics, bioavailability,
stability, metabolism, and translocation into the brain,
will also be important in determining which structures
are most effective in vivo. Critically, however, this is the
first report to our knowledge to demonstrate that pos-
itional isomers of proelectrophilic hydroquinones are an
important determinant in the activation of Nrf2- and HSF-
1-mediated stress responses, and the disparate effect of
these isomers is closely tied to their oxidation potentials.
