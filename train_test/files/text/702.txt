Age More Successfully?

Background. Long-lived individuals are rare and may be se-
lected in part for the genetic factors that promote successful
aging. The children of long-lived parents may therefore age
more successfully than the children of short-lived parents.
Methods. We used three major cross-sectional population-
based surveys to study the association of parental longevity
with successful aging in offspring. The measures of aging were
hand-grip strength, cognitive performance (Mini Mental State
Examination and a cognitive composite score), self-reported
diseases, and self-rated health.
Results. For every additional 10 years the parents lived, their
children's grip strength increased by 0.32 kg (95% CI 
0.00­0.63), Mini Mental State Examination score by 0.20
points (95% CI  0.03­0.37), and cognitive composite score
by 0.24 points (95% CI  0.07­0.40). A 10-year increment of
parental life was associated with a reduction by approximately
0.20 in the adjusted odds ratio for their children having each
of the following conditions: diabetes; hypertension; ischemic
heart disease; heart failure; stroke; or fair, poor, or very poor
self-rated health. Almost all the effects were seen solely in the
cohort of 70-year-olds, but not among middle-aged or nona-
genarian subjects.
Conclusions. Parental life span is positively associated with
the children's physical and cognitive functioning and avoid-
ance of some of the common chronic diseases. However, the
effects are small and are seen among offspring who are
elderly, but not among the middle-aged or the oldest old.

Key words: aging, twins, oldest-old, parents, longevity, hand strength, cognition.
Maintenance of high physical and cognitive
functioning and avoidance of disease and dis-
ability are central to "successful" aging.1 Ever
since Rowe and Kahn1 introduced the concept of suc-
cessful aging, a number of mainly environmental predic-
tors (eg, education, income, social network, physical
activity, and smoking status) have been shown to influ-
ence the components of successful aging.2,3 In recent
years, researchers have also begun to investigate the
contribution of genetic factors to successful aging.4­6
Studies of elderly twins suggest that genetic factors ac-
count for a substantial proportion of the variance in
physical7 and cognitive8,9 functioning, and a moderate
proportion of variance in life span.10 An important ge-
netic component to some of the major diseases of aging,
such as cardiovascular diseases,11 diabetes and impaired
glucose tolerance,12 and some cancers (breast, prostate,
and colorectal),13 has also been found. Long-lived indi-
viduals are rare and may be selected in part for the
genetic factors that promote successful aging. The chil-
dren of long-lived parents may therefore age more suc-
cessfully than the children of short-lived parents. What-
ever the mechanism, not much is known about the
interplay between parental longevity and the aging of
offspring. Here we use three major Danish nationwide
surveys of middle-aged, elderly, and oldest-old people to
study the association of parental life span with the re-
spondents' physical and cognitive functioning, as well as
specific illnesses.

of Aging Danish Twins--3rd wave (LSADT),15 and the
Danish 1905 Cohort Survey (1905),16 which have all
been described in detail previously. In brief, participants
in the MADT and LSADT studies were identified in the
Danish Twin Register,17 and participants in the 1905
survey were identified in the Danish Civil Registration
System, both nationwide, population-based registers
that are continuously updated. The eligible participants
in the MADT study represented a random sample of 120
twin pairs from each of the 22 birth cohorts in 1931­
1952. The eligible participants in the LSADT were
Danish twins age 70 years and older in 1999, and those
in the 1905 study were all Danes born in 1905. All
surveys were conducted in periods of 3­6 months in
1998­1999. The participation rates were 83.1% in the
MADT (N  4,314), 69.9% in the LSADT (N 
2,709), and 62.8% in the 1905 cohort study (N 
2,262). All three studies used a highly comparable struc-
tured interview, which was home-based and included
physical and cognitive testing performed by lay inter-
viewers from the Danish National Institute of Social
Research. All interviewers had substantial experience
interviewing the elderly and furthermore completed a
detailed training program by a physician and were
closely monitored during the interview periods.
All studies were approved of by the Danish scientific
ethical committees, and all participants provided in-
formed consent.
Parental Age at Death
Information on parental age at death was obtained
during the interview in the LSADT and 1905 studies
and through a mailed questionnaire (1996­1998) before
the MADT study. The twins within the intact pairs
(both twins in a pair participating) reported their fa-
ther's age at death with a correlation of 0.99 (95%
confidence interval [CI]  0.99­0.99) in the MADT
study and 0.96 (95% CI  0.95­0.96) in the LSADT
study, and their mother's age at death with a correlation
of 0.98 (95% CI  0.98­0.99) in the MADT and 0.98
(95% CI  0.97­0.98) in the LSADT study. In the
MADT and LSADT studies both twins in a pair were
excluded if they differed by 5 or more years in their
report of either their father's or mother's age at death
(N  244 individuals). The average of the fathers' and
mothers' ages at death, as well as fathers' and mothers'
ages at death separately, was used in the analyses.
Physical Functioning
Hand-grip strength, which has been shown to reflect
overall muscle strength,18 was measured with a hand
dynamometer (Smedley's dynamometer TTM, Tokyo).
We identified the maximum value of three measures
with each hand in the LSADT and MADT studies, and
of three measures with the preferred hand in the 1905
study. Participants with fewer than three attempts, or
with a difference of 20 kg or more between two mea-
sures, were excluded from this analysis (N  268).
Cognitive Functioning
Integrated in the interview was a series of cognitive
tests including the Mini Mental State Examination
(MMSE) (in the LSADT and the 1905 studies only), a
test of fluency (number of animals named in 1 minute),
forward and backward digit span, and a modified 12-
word learning test. The scores of the four latter tests
were standardized and summed to form a cognitive com-
posite score that was used in the analysis.
Health
In all surveys the participants were asked whether a
physician had ever told them that they suffered from
various diseases. Participants who answered "Yes, previ-
ously" or "Yes, currently" were subsequently asked to
confirm that this was a diagnosis made by a doctor,
before the answer was accepted as valid.
Data Analysis
We divided participants into five groups by average
parental age at death (54, 55­64, 65­74, 75­84, and
85) and compared these groups with regard to physical
and cognitive functioning as well as a number of self-
reported diseases. Several potential confounding charac-
teristics (body mass index, smoking habits, alcohol con-
sumption, and education) were confirmed to be
unrelated to parental life span. Both parents were de-
ceased for about half of the participants in the MADT
study. In the LSADT study only 15 participants had one
parent still alive, and in the 1905 cohort study none of
the participants had living parents. All measures were
age- and sex-adjusted by subtracting age (in 5-year in-
tervals) and sex-specific means from the actual scores.19
The residuals are presented in the figures. In all subse-
quent analyses, participants with parents who on average
died before age 54 were excluded (N  243) as a result
of the large proportion of deaths not related to the
biology of aging (eg, accidents and suicides) before this
age. After this, the effect of increasing the mean parental
age at death by 10 years was assessed by entering the
categorized value as a continuous measure in a multivar-
iate linear regression model for continuous outcomes
(grip strength and cognitive tests) or in a logistic regres-
sion model for dichotomous outcomes (self-reported dis-
eases), controlling for the age and sex of the participants.
A model with parental age at death as a continuous
variable and a model with parental age at death in
10-year groups gave virtually the same results and com-
parable Bayesian information criteria. To account for
the nonindependence of the observations on twins,
twins from pairs in which both participated were ana-

lyzed as clusters of two in the multivariate models. Thir-
teen twins born in 1905 participated in both the 1905
and the LSADT survey. The data from both surveys of
these participants were used in the analyses because they
were so few and sampled with an interval of 6 months.
Results
Table 1 shows the basic characteristics of the partic-
ipants in the three surveys. Table 2 shows the number of
participants across categories of parental longevity. At
least one parent was still alive among 1,920 (20.7%),
and information regarding age at death was missing
among 887 (9.6%, Table 2). In the MADT study, the
twins in 1,978 (99.2%), 1,581 (99.2%), and 1,306
(98.9%) intact pairs reported their father's, mother's, or
both parents' age at death within 4 years. In the
LSADT, the twins in 473 (88.6%), 490 (89.4%), and
428 (80.8%) intact pairs reported their father's, moth-
er's, and both parents' age at death within 4 years.
Mean parental age at death was only modestly asso-
ciated with physical and cognitive functioning, as seen
in Figures 1­3 and Table 3. For each 10-year increase in
parental life span, average grip strength increased by
only 0.32 kg (95% CI  0.00­0.63) (Table 3). The
effect was seen only in the LSADT cohort (mean age
mid-70s), but not among the twins who were middle-
aged (MADT), or the cohort of nonagenarians (1905).
Likewise, the relation of cognitive functioning to paren-
tal age at death was seen solely in the LSADT cohort;
each 10-year increase in parental age at death was asso-
ciated with an increase of 0.20 (95% CI  0.03­0.37)
MMSE points and 0.24 (95% CI  0.07­0.40) cognitive
composite points (Table 3). The analyses used for Table
3 were repeated using parental age at death as a contin-
uous variable in the multivariate linear regression mod-
els. The coefficients were, when multiplied by 10, vir-
tually identical to the ones in Table 3 (results not
shown).
A number of self-reported diseases were associated
with parental life span (Table 4). Again the effect was
mainly present in the LSADT cohort. In this cohort the
age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for having either
previous or current diabetes, hypertension, ischemic
heart disease, heart failure, or stroke each decreased by
roughly 0.20 for every 10-year increase in mean parental
age at death (Table 4). Also, the odds for having fair,
poor, or very poor self-rated health were associated with
parental age at death: OR  0.8 (0.7 to 0.9) in both the
MADT and LSADT cohorts by 10-year increase in
parental age at death. Pulmonary disease, cancer, osteo-
arthritis, and osteoporosis were not associated with pa-

rental life span in any cohort (Table 4). In the 1905
cohort, parental life span was not associated with any
disease or self-rated health. In the MADT cohort there
was a borderline association of parental life span with
hypertension and stroke, but not with any other disease
(Table 4). Because the associations observed between
parental life span and stroke, ischemic heart disease, and
heart failure could reflect confounding from the associ-
ation also seen with hypertension and diabetes, we sub-
sequently used a model for stroke, ischemic heart dis-
ease, and heart failure including hypertension and
diabetes only in the LSADT sample. The point esti-
mates from these models for these three diseases were
virtually unaltered.
Discussion
The relationship between long-lived parents and suc-
cessful aging has been reported in one previous paper.20
Vaillant studied a cohort of 188 males age 65 years who
had been recruited in 1940­1942 as healthy students
from the top half of their classes in college (Harvard
University). When the 16% with longest maximum
ancestral longevity were compared with the 16% with
shortest ancestral longevity, long-lived ancestors pre-
dicted "sustained health" on a crude 1­5 scale.
A number of issues in our study need to be addressed.
The information about parental life span was based on
self-report from the participants, which could be subject
to error, although it is reassuring that the twins within
the intact pairs reported their parents' age at death with
high correlations. The proportion able to report the
parental age at death (3 years) compared with death
certificates has previously been found in Sweden to be
between 82.8% and 86.5% for fathers and 86.7% and
90.2% for mothers.21
To estimate the effect of potential misclassification of
parental age at death, we repeated the analyses exclud-
ing those in which the interviewers stated that the
interview was completed with difficulties (of any kind
and severity) (N  1,324). The point estimates after this
restriction were very similar to those reported here,
although the confidence intervals widened.
We report here the results of the analyses using the
average of the mothers' and fathers' age at death as the
covariate of interest. This approach enabled us to use the
FIGURE 3. MMSE score by parental longevity (age- and
sex-adjusted residuals) among participants in two surveys: the

(LSADT), and the Danish 1905 Cohort Survey (1905).

information from those with two long-lived parents, a
group that could be expected to experience "successful
aging." To get an impression of parental-specific effects,
we also analyzed the effects of fathers' and mothers' ages
at death separately. However, the results were not sys-
tematically different between the two (results not
shown). The results from the participants with one or
two parents still alive were censored from the analyses.
As seen in Table 2, the number of participants omitted
for this reason was only considerable in the MADT
cohort and may have contributed to the lack of associ-
ation between parental age at death and the outcomes in
this cohort.
Participants who did not provide information on pa-
rental age at death were more cognitively impaired than
the rest (Figures 2­3). These participants were also ap-
proximately 10 years older (mean 81.2  14.2) than
participants without missing information (mean 70.9 
15.8). The direction of the potential bias introduced by
the lack of information from these participants is not
evident.
When analyzing MMSE score as the outcome, we
used methods that rely on a normal distribution of the
data. Because the MMSE score is highly skewed, we
repeated the regressions using bootstrap methods.22 The
confidence intervals differed only in the third decimal
place (data not shown).
We found that parental life span is associated with
physical and cognitive functioning and health in the
cohort of 70 year olds. Age-related differences in func-
tioning and health among middle-aged individuals may
not be large enough to detect a small effect of parental
longevity. In the nonagenarian 1905 cohort, it would
have been surprising if parental life span had had an
impact, because reaching an age of 92 may in itself be
regarded as successful aging.
In conclusion, we found that at older ages parental
life span is positively associated with physical and cog-
nitive functioning and avoidance of some of the quan-
titatively important diseases. However, the overall ef-
fects are small in absolute terms and are seen only among
