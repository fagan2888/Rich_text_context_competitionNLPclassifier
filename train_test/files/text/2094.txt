Pediatric Obesity
Introduction
Childhood obesity is increasingly recognized as a public
health concern in the United States and globally. Data from
the 2007­2008 NHANES show that the prevalence of obes-
ity in the United States is 16.9% among all children ages
2­19, and the prevalence has been reported as high as 29%
among certain racial/ethnic groups (1). Obesity in child-
hood is associated with an increased risk for many adverse
physical and psychosocial health outcomes (2). As a growth-
promoting process that affects almost every organ system
in the human body (3), obesity has been shown to affect
the timing of puberty in boys and girls (4). Before puberty,
overweight children are significantly taller than their age-
matched peers (5). Given its association with accelerations
in growth and maturation it is reasonable to hypothesize
that obesity affects the timing of tooth eruption.
Tooth eruption is the movement of a tooth from its position
in the osseous crypt into the oral cavity. Although the exact
mechanisms underlying this process are not entirely known,
many factors appear to play a role. Demographic factors, such
as race, sex, and age may influence the process (6). Physiologic
factors thought to be involved include molecular signaling (7)
and several hormones and mediators that affect growth (8).
Growth of the mandible is known to be influenced by pubertal
timing (9). Deciduous tooth eruption may be altered in con-
junction with certain systemic disorders, such as diabetes mel-
litus and congenital abnormalities (10,11). Alterations in the
timing of tooth eruption can significantly impact oral health
due to its potential to cause malocclusion (the improper posi-
tioning of the teeth and jaws) and/or crowding, which may in
turn lead to poor oral hygiene and periodontal disease (12,13).
In addition, the length of time a tooth is present in the oral cav-
ity affects its risk for dental caries. Furthermore, sequencing of
eruption may impact occlusion which may have consequences
for periodontal and temporomandibular joint disorders.
A relationship between the timing of a child's primary teeth
andbothpostnatalgrowth(14,15)andnutritionalstatus(16­18)
has been observed; however, few studies have been conducted
to examine the effects of obesity on the timing of permanent
tooth eruption. One longitudinal study conducted in Mexico
City found that among 110 children, obese children had more
erupted teeth than nonobese children, after accounting for sex
and age at baseline (19). A US study of 104 children found that
obesity was associated with accelerated dental development

and Tooth Eruption

Obesity is a growth-promoting process as evidenced by its effect on the timing of puberty. Although studies are
limited, obesity has been shown to affect the timing of tooth eruption. Both the timing and sequence of tooth eruption
are important to overall oral health. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between obesity and
tooth eruption. Data were combined from three consecutive cycles (2001­2006) of the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) and analyzed to examine associations between the number of teeth erupted (NET)
and obesity status (BMI z-score >95th percentile BMI relative to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) growth reference) among children 5 up to 14 years of age, controlling for potential confounding by age, gender,
race, and socioeconomic status (SES). Obesity is significantly associated with having a higher average NET during
the mixed dentition period. On average, teeth of obese children erupted earlier than nonobese children with obese
children having on average 1.44 more teeth erupted than nonobese children, after adjusting for age, gender, and race/
ethnicity (P < 0.0001). SES was not a confounder of the observed associations. Obese children, on average, have
significantly more teeth erupted than nonobese children after adjusting for gender, age, and race. These findings
may have clinical importance in the area of dental and orthodontic medicine both in terms of risk for dental caries
due to extended length of time exposed in the oral cavity and sequencing which may increase the likelihood of
malocclusions.

Pediatric Obesity
(assessed as the difference between chronologic age and den-
tal age) after adjusting for age and gender (20). Tooth eruption
has been linked to developmental stage, which in turn is also
related to body fatness (21,22). A cross-sectional study of 102
12-year-old girls from Hong Kong found that sexual maturity
was related to body weight, height, and tooth eruption. Girls
who were classified as "early maturers" had more erupted per-
manent canines, premolars, and second molars compared to
"late maturers" (23). These aforementioned studies were limited
by the study of small nonrepresentative samples of children.
The purpose of the current study was to perform a cross-

sectional analysis of the association between childhood obes-
ity and tooth eruption, accounting for age, sex, and race in a
nationally representative data set, the NHANES. Differences
in the average number of permanent teeth erupted (NET)
between obese and nonobese children by age were examined.
We hypothesized that obesity would be associated with accel-
erated tooth eruption, and that differences in age-specific tooth
eruption would differ by race/ethnicity and by gender.
Methods and Procedures
Study population
Data were obtained from the NHANES, a continuing survey of the
civilian, noninstitutionalized US population (24). The oral health
examination in the NHANES is completed by a dentist who has under-
gone extensive training, including a calibration phase in which the
degree of correlation between the dental examiners and a standard
examiner is assessed. Complete information on procedures and assess-
ment included in the oral health component can be found at http://
www.cdc.gov/ nchs/data/nhanes/oh-e.pdf. To achieve a sample size
required for reliable estimates for testing differences between sub-
domains (25), three cycles of NHANES (2001­2002, 2003­2004, and
2005­2006) were combined for this analysis. Variables for this analy-
sis were extracted from the demographic, body measures, and dental
health publicly available data files, and merged based on the sequence
number (SEQN) (ID) variable for each relevant cycle for this analysis
and one file was created by appending the 2003­2004 and 2005­2006
cycles to the 2001­2002 file.
Overall 31,509 participants comprise the combined data file. All analy-
ses were restricted to the 5,838 participants between 5 (the minimum age
at the dental exam) up to 14 years of age (the end of the mixed dentition
period). Excluded from the analytic data set were participants who were
not both interviewed and examined (n = 200), pregnant (n = 1), and
those who were missing data on tooth count or BMI (n = 203). After these
exclusions, 5,434 participants remained for analysis.
Selection of variables
Several key variables were created for this analysis. The NET was calcu-
lated by taking the sum of all permanent teeth erupted for each subject
(excluding the 3rd molars). A permanent tooth was considered to be
erupted if it was coded as a "permanent tooth" or a "permanent dental
root fragment" and considered to be non-erupted otherwise. Obesity sta-
tuswasdefinedbasedonBMIz-scoreasbeinggreaterthanorequaltothe
95th percentile (obesity) or between the 85th and 95th percentile (over-
weight), based on the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) growth charts (26). Age, race/ethnicity, gender, and the poverty
income ratio (PIR), were examined as independent predictors or con-
founders of the association between NET and obesity. Race/ethnicity
was categorized as other, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, other
Hispanic, or non-Hispanic white. PIR is a measure of socioeconomic sta-
tus(SES)andiscalculatedastheratioof
householdincometothepoverty
threshold after accounting for inflation and 
family size.
Domain variables were created for subpopulation analyses and speci-
fied the study population of interest while retaining all other observations
from the data set. To incorporate the sample weighting in this study,
a new sample weight was calculated for the merged 6-year sample by
multiplying the 2-year examination sample weight by one-third (1/3),
as recommended (27). This approach utilizes the sampling scheme in
NHANES and properly estimates variance.
Statistical analyses
Analyses were accomplished using SAS (Version 9.2; SAS, Cary, NC).
Exploratory data analyses were performed by examination of visual repre-
sentationsandsummarystatisticsforthevariablesofinterest.Comparisons
of the two groups (obese and nonobese) were made using independent
samples t-test for continuous variables and 2 tests for categorical variables.
We also examined the relationship between NET and weight status using
three categories: normal weight (<85th percentile), overweight (85th and
<95th percentile), and obese (95th percentile). Normal weight subjects
were used as the reference category in this secondary analysis.
Simple linear regression was used to explore the association between
the NET and obesity. To assess secular trends across the three waves
of data, a variable representing the cycle year was added to the model,
including an interaction term for obesity and cycle year.
The association between the NET and each potential confounder (age,
gender, race, and PIR) was evaluated using simple linear regression analy-
sis. Each predictor was then added to a model that included obesity to
check for confounding. All significant predictors and confounders were
included in an adjusted model, and collinearity was examined. Effect
modification was evaluated by including all two-way interaction terms
between obesity and age, gender, race, and PIR. An  of 0.05 was used to
declare statistical significance.
Results
Table 1 shows the differences in sociodemographic character-
istics between obese and nonobese children. Obese subjects
had a higher mean age than nonobese subjects. In addition,
there was a higher proportion of Mexican Americans in the
obese group and a lower proportion of non-Hispanic white
Americans. Obese subjects also had a lower median PIR. There
was no significant difference in the proportion of males and
females in the two groups.
Bivariate analyses revealed several differences in NET. NET
was significantly associated with obesity status (P < 0.0001).
Obese subjects had a higher median NET. NET was also
significantly associated with being female (P < 0.0001) and
race/ethnicity (P < 0.0001). As expected, there was a strong
positive correlation between NET and age (Pearson r = 0.93,
P < 0.0001). NET was not significantly correlated with PIR
(P = 0.30; Spearman correlation), however.
Table 2 and Figure 1 show NET by age category and obes-
ity status at the mean and median, respectively. In all age cat-
egories from age 7 onward, obese subjects had significantly
greater mean NET than nonobese subjects. The greatest dif-
ferences in NET are seen at age 10 and age 11, with obese
subjects exceeding nonobese subjects by a mean of 2.7 and a
median of six teeth.
Table 3 shows the results of the linear regression analyses.
In an unadjusted analysis (model 1) obesity is significantly
associated with NET, and 1% of the variation in tooth erup-
tion explained by this model. Cycle year was not significantly
associated with NET in the presence of obesity. When poten-
tial confounders were examined independently, age, gender,

and race/ethnicity were all significant confounders of the asso-
ciation between obesity and NET. PIR was not significantly
associated with NET in the presence of obesity. In a full model
adjusting for significant confounders, age, gender and race/
ethnicity all remained statistically significant, with no evidence
of collinearity, secular trend across the survey cycles, or other
two-way interactions.
The final model is presented as model 2 in Table 3. On
average, obese subjects have 1.44 more teeth erupted than
nonobese subjects after controlling for age, gender, and race/
ethnicity (P < 0.0001). The R2 for this model is 0.85 and rep-
resents a significantly better fit compared to the unadjusted
model. Racial differences in tooth eruption, after adjusting for
obesity, were also observed. Participants classified as Mexican
American, non-Hispanic black, and of other race have signifi-
cantly greater NET on average compared to participants classi-
fied as non-Hispanic white.
In secondary analyses, overweight subjects had 0.52 more
teeth erupted on average compared to normal weight subjects,
after adjusting for age, gender, and race/ethnicity (P = 0.02).
With these same statistical adjustments, subjects classified
as obese had 1.55 more teeth erupted than normal weight

subjects (P < 0.0001).

Discussion
In this study, the NET was significantly and positively associ-
ated with obesity after controlling for age, gender, and race/
ethnicity. The predictive model that includes obesity status,
age, gender, and race explains almost 85% of the variability in
NET. Some variability may be attributable to characteristics
not included in the current analysis, such as nutrition, tempo-
ral variations, season of birth, climate, and/or developmental
conditions such as Down's syndrome. We also found the NET
was elevated in association with overweight, but the magni-
tude of the positive association was smaller.
An association between the timing of tooth eruption and
BMI has been observed previously in nonrepresentative sam-
ples. A recent longitudinal study conducted over a 4-year
period in 88 Mexican school children found a significant rela-
tionship between BMI category and tooth eruption patterns
(19). At baseline (mean (s.d.) age 7.1 (0.32) years), children in
the overweight category had 4.29 more teeth erupted on aver-
age than children classified as "thin" (BMI between the 5th and
less than the 50th percentiles). Based on the results of a longi-
tudinal mixed model, the overweight group had about 5 more
teeth at age 11 than the thin group, after adjustment for age
at baseline, sex, SES, and primary teeth present. This differ-
ence far exceeds the 1.44 difference in the NET observed in our
analysis; however, the reference category (children classified as
thin) used for both the baseline and longitudinal analyses was
very different than the one used in our study. In a small cross-
sectional study that assessed the difference between dental age
and chronologic age in relation to BMI, dental age difference
significantly increased with increases in BMI (mean (s.d.) den-
tal age difference was 0.63 (1.31) for normal weight subjects,
1.51 (1.22) for overweight subjects, and 1.58 (1.28) for obese
subjects) (20).
The findings in this study have clinical importance in the area
of caries risk and risk for malocclusion. Disturbances in the
timing of tooth eruption can affect new emerging teeth (28),
which influences timing of treatment. Failure to treat early
enough may lead to increased oral health problems such as
malocclusion, crowding, and impaired oral hygiene (10). Failed
planning in the timing of treatment may also necessitate addi-
tional treatments later on. The results of this study indicate that
teeth may be erupting sooner in obese children, underscoring
the need for comprehensive periodic oral evaluation.
Several limitations to our study are noteworthy. First, during
the tooth count portion of the dental exam, teeth are coded
as "not present" if they have not yet emerged. This is often
the situation for very young subjects. However, teeth are also
coded as not present if they have been extracted. This might
be the case for slightly older subjects who have had orthodon-
tic surgery. This dual coding likely leads to misclassification
for subjects who have had teeth extracted. In addition, tooth
emergence itself is a gradual process, with potential for some
misclassification in coding a tooth as erupted or not. Both of
these sources of error would be expected to be non-differential
(similar by obesity status), and would attenuate the differences
observed. Furthermore, tooth extraction itself can lead to alter-
ations in the timing of tooth eruption (29). However, due to
the young age of the study population, the number of extracted
teeth is likely very small and similar in both groups and thus
would not be expected to affect the results of this study. After
the third cycle (1988­1994), NHANES did not assess matu-
rational timing, such as Tanner stage, which precluded our
ability to explore maturation as a mechanism for accelerated
eruption. The PIR has been criticized for its failure to include
tax burden or account for regional differences in cost of living
(30). Nonetheless, it remains the measure of choice in analyses
of nationally representative data in the United States (31,32).
It is important to note that 404 participants (7% of the ana-
lytic sample) missing values on one or more variables were not
included in the linear regression analysis. These subjects were
older, were of higher SES, and included a higher proportion
of whites and Hispanic Americans. Our analysis was able to
examine only the cross-sectional association between obes-
ity status and tooth eruption; it was not able to explore the
timing of the onset of obesity. Variations in this timing may
affect this association and should be explored in future studies.
Among the study's strengths was the use of a nationally rep-
resentative sample of US children whose dental examination
followed a standardized research protocol. Obesity status was
similarly based on a standardized anthropometric examina-
tion with BMI defined based on the CDC growth reference.
The sample available for these analyses was large enough to
examine age-specific comparisons between obese and non-
obese participants.
Our results suggest that obese children's teeth erupt ear-
lier than nonobese children's teeth. In this analysis, obesity
was shown to be significantly associated with the NET dur-
ing the mixed dentition period, independent of gender, age,
and race/ethnicity. Differences in NET were greatest before
puberty; the later onset of puberty among nonobese subjects
may provide time for them to "catch-up". On average, obese
children had 1.44 more teeth erupted than nonobese children.

This difference is substantial and noteworthy because these
findings may have implications for the planning and timing
of oral health care for obese children. It is not clear from this
study whether the altered timing in tooth eruption affects
the oral health of obese children, but future studies should
explore this potential outcome. Future research should also
examine the timing of the onset of obesity with respect to
tooth emergence to establish how incidence will affect this
association. Finally, more research is needed to examine the
association between obesity and the order of tooth emer-
gence, as this may also impact oral health. These findings may
have implications for dental and orthodontic health care.
