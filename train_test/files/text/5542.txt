Introduction
Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of renal
failure. It is defined by proteinuria > 500 mg in 24 hours in
the setting of diabetes, but this is preceded by lower degrees
of proteinuria, or "microalbuminuria." Microalbuminuria
is defined as albumin excretion of 30­299 mg/24 hours.
Without intervention, diabetic patients with microalbuminu-
ria typically progress to proteinuria and overt DN. This pro-
gression occurs in types 1 and 2 diabetes. The pathological
changes to the kidney include increased glomerular
basement membrane (GBM) thickness, microaneurysm for-
mation, mesangial nodule formation (Kimmelsteil-Wilson
bodies), and other changes. As many as 7% of patients with
type 2 diabetes may already have microalbuminuria at the
time they are diagnosed with diabetes.1
DN, or nephropatia diabetica, also known as
Kimmelstiel-Wilson syndrome, or nodular diabetic glomer-
ulosclerosis and intercapillary glomerulonephritis, is a pro-
gressive kidney disease caused by angiopathy of capillaries
in the kidney glomeruli. It is characterized by nephrotic

Abstract
Introduction: The objective of this article is to investigate the combination of telmisartan with vildagliptin therapy versus
monotherapy of vildagliptin and telmisartan on diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus rats.
Materials and methods: In adult rats streptozotocin (65 mg/kg) and nicotinamide (110 mg/kg) were injected intraperitone-
ally to produce diabetic nephropathy. Rats of either sex allotted to the following groups: (i) triple therapy: metformin
(120 mg/kg, o.d.) + pioglitazone (1.25 mg/kg, o.d.) + glimepiride (0.7 mg/kg, o.d.); (ii) dual therapy: vildagliptin (8.76 mg/
kg, o.d.) + telmisartan (6.48 mg/kg, o.d.); (iii) vildagliptin (8.76 mg/kg, o.d.); and (iv) telmisartan (6.48 mg/kg, o.d.); therapy
was carried out for 35 days orally. Weekly at days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35, blood pressure, blood glucose level, body weight,
blood serum creatinine level, protein albumin level in urine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were estimated. Renal
structural changes were observed.
Results: Blood pressure, blood glucose level, blood serum creatinine level, protein albumin level in urine, BUN and renal
deterioration increased significantly in diabetic rats compared with normal control rats. The vildagliptin + telmisartan
treatment group showed no weight gain and controlled blood pressure, renovascular structural and biochemical param-
eters in diabetic neuropathy rats.
Conclusions: The addition of telmisartan to vildagliptin demonstrated the best control over blood pressure, glycemia and
diabetic nephropathy markers, renal structural changes and improvement of renal function as opposed to monotherapy
with either drug, possibly because of the dual inhibitory effect on the renin­angiotensin system.

syndrome and diffuse glomerulosclerosis. It is due to
longstanding diabetes mellitus and is a prime indication for
dialysis in many Western countries. DN is a common
complication of diabetes mellitus in which there is long-
term damage to the kidneys as a result of long-term poorly
controlled diabetes. The renal vessels and the glomerulus
are the main areas affected. DN is characterized by the
presence of a protein called albumin in the urine, hyperten-
sion (high blood pressure), edema (swelling) and progres-
sive renal insufficiency.2
Vildagliptin is an antihyperglycemic agent that selectively
inhibits the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzyme. Such
inhibition prevents the degradation of the incretin hormones
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent
insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). This results in improved
glycemic control as determined by glycated hemoglobin
(HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels and, in
addition, an enhancement of pancreatic - and -cell func-
tion. Vildagliptin is indicated in the European Union and
elsewhere in the world for the management of type 2 diabe-
tes mellitus in combination with metformin, a sulfonylurea
or a thiazolidinedione in patients with inadequate glycemic
control following monotherapy. Vildagliptin is also available
as a fixed-dose formulation with metformin.3
One study has demonstrated that treatment with tel-
misartan significantly decreased fasting blood glucose
(FBG). The antidiabetic activity of telmisartan may be
due to improved glucose metabolism via the blocking of
the inhibitory effect of angiotensin II (Ang II) on insulin
signal transmission and telmisartan's function as a mod-
erately potent partial peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor gamma (PPAR-) agonist activating the receptor
to 25­30% of the levels of the full agonists, such as the
thiazolidinedione agents. There are structural resem-
blances between the angiotensin II receptor blocker
(ARB) agents and the full PPAR- agonists, such as
rosiglitazone and pioglitazone.4
Oral vildagliptin in combination with metformin, a
sulfonylurea or a thiazolidinedione, improved glycemic
control in adults with type 2 diabetes and appeared to
slow the progression of -cell degeneration in trials of
24­52 weeks' duration. In trials in patients with diabetes
inadequately controlled with metformin, vildagliptin
provided an additional reduction of HbA1c levels of
1.1% and was shown to be as effective as pioglitazone as
add-on therapy in a noninferiority trial. Vildagliptin had
a low risk of hypoglycemia, was weight-neutral overall
and was generally well tolerated.3
Further investigation is required to accurately position
vildagliptin relative to other drugs. This further investiga-
tion may be based on a combination of vildagliptin and
several angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors /ARBs.
Randomized studies have demonstrated that ARBs, control-
ling systemic blood pressure, delay progression of pro-
teinuria, reduce microalbuminuria, prevent progression to
macroalbuminuria and maintain renal function in patients
with DN. Telmisartan is a member of the ARB class and is
being investigated in the most ambitious and far-reaching
research program ever conducted with anARB. Telmisartan
has a number of features that may make it particularly suit-
able for the treatment of DN. In addition to its long duration
of action and almost exclusive fecal excretion, its high lipo-
philicity should assist in tissue penetration.5
So, the present study focuses on dual therapy of vilda-
gliptin and telmisartan on DN in experimentally induced
type-2 diabetic mellitus rats.
Materials and methods
Animals
Adult Wistar Albino Rats weighing 150 to 250 g bred in
the Animal House, Gyan Vihar School of Pharmacy,
Suresh Gyan Vihar University, were used. All animal
experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal
Ethical Committee (Gyan Vihar School of Pharmacy),
Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of
Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA) No. 1234/a/08/
CPCSEA. The animals were housed in polycarbonate
cages in a room with a 12-hour (h) day-night cycle, tem-
perature of 24 ± 2°C and humidity of 45 to 64%. During
the whole experimental period, animals were fed with a
balanced commercial diet and water ad libitum.
Induction of diabetic neuropathy
Nicotinamide-streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetes in
the rat6­9.Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was
induced in overnight fasted rats by a single intraperitonial
injection of 65 mg/kg body weight STZ, 15 minutes (min)
after the intraperitonial administration of 110 mg/kg body
weight of nicotinamide. STZ was dissolved in citrate buffer
(0.1 M, pH 4.5) and nicotinamide was dissolved in normal
saline. The injection site was the dorsal midpoint between
the pelvis and ribs close to the right side of the spine.
Hyperglycemia was confirmed by the elevated glucose lev-
els in plasma, determined at 72 h and then on day 7 after
injection. Animals with blood glucose concentration more
than 200 mg/dl were used for the study.
Drugs and chemicals
Ketamine (Themis Medicare Ltd, Mumbai, India), STZ
(Sigma Aldrich), nicotinamide (Lobal Chemie), vildaglip-
tin (Novartis Pharma) and telmisartan (Aristo Pharma Ltd.
Mumbai, India) were used in the current study.
Experimental protocol
Animals used included insulin-resistant (IR) type 2 diabetic
rats (induced by intraperitoneal STZ and nicotinamide). IR
rats of either sex were randomly allotted into different
412 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)
experimental groups, each containing six animals. Drug
treatment (i) triple therapy: metformin (120 mg/kg, o.d.) +
pioglitazone (1.25 mg/kg, o.d.) + glimepiride (0.7 mg/kg,
o.d.); (ii) dual therapy: vildagliptin (8.76 mg/kg) + tel-
misartan (6.48 mg/kg); (iii) vildagliptin (8.76 mg/kg); and
(iv) telmisartan (6.48 mg/kg) was carried out for 35 days
with the help of an oral catheter every morning. Weekly at
day 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35, blood pressure, blood glucose
level, body weight, blood serum creatinine level, protein
albumin level in urine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was esti-
mated in STZ-nicotinamide-induced DN in rats (Table 1).
Collection of blood samples
At the end of drug treatment, all the animals were fasted
overnight but allowed free access to water. The next morn-
ing, a blood sample was withdrawn by retro orbital sinus
under mild ether anesthesia. The blood samples were col-
lected into vacutainers precoated with ethylenediaminetet-
raacetic acid (EDTA) as anticoagulant. Blood samples were
centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min in a refrigerated centri-
fuge (i.e. temperature 4°C). The plasma separated as
straw-colored supernatant was used for various biochemi-
cal parameters. It was stored at -20°C until the completion
of the analysis.
Collection of urine sample
At the end of drug treatment, all the animals were kept in
metabolic cages for 24 h. Animals were fasted but allowed
free access to water. Urine samples were collected after 24
h in urine-collecting bottles.
Biochemical estimations
Measurement of renal function and biochemical parameters
1) Blood glucose was measured by Accu-Chek Active
glucose strips. The blood glucose estimation was
performed weekly after administration of the test
compound.
2) Albumin excretion rate and total protein excre-
tion rate in urine were measured using Span and
Ranbaxy diagnostic kits by autoanalyzer (Echo,
Logotech Pvt. Ltd, India).
3) BUN values were measured by the BUN GLDH kit
(Bhat Bio-tech Pvt. Ltd, Bangalore, India) tech-
nique as per instructions of the kit manufacturers.
A BUN test measures the amount of nitrogen in blood
that comes from the waste product urea. Urea is made when
protein is broken down in the body. Urea is made in the
liver and passed out of the body in urine.
A BUN test is performed to see how well the kidneys are
working. If the kidneys are not able to remove urea from
the blood normally, the BUN level rises. Heart failure,
dehydration, or a diet high in protein can also make the
BUN level higher. Liver disease or damage can lower the
BUN level.
4) Serum creatinine rate was measured using
CREATININE KIT by Mod. Jaffe's Kinetic Method
(Coral Clinical System, Goa, India).
Creatinine is the catabolic product of creatinine phos-
phate, which is used by the skeletal muscle. The daily pro-
duction depends on muscular mass, and it is excreted out of
the body entirely by the kidneys. Elevated levels are found
in renal dysfunction, reduced renal blood flow (shock,
dehydration, congestive heart failure) and diabetes acro-
megaly. Decreased levels are found in muscular dystrophy.
5) Blood pressure was monitored using the tail-cuff
method for all of the groups.
Histopathological examination
At the end of the experiments, all rats were sacrificed and
pathological analysis of the kidney was performed. The
kidney tissues were preserved in buffered neutral formalin
and stored at -20 ºC until processed for histopathology.
Tissues were preserved in 1% w/v glutaraldehyde and 4%
w/v formaldehyde in phosphate buffer, pH -7.2 at 4ºC
until processed for electron microscopy. Tissues were pro-
cessed for histopathology at room temperature and
involved the following steps: (a) fixation, (b) processing

preparation and cutting of sections, and (d) attaching sec-
tions to slides. After processing, sections were stained
with hematoxylin-eosin stain using Harris's alum hema-
toxylin and stock 1% w/v alcohol eosin solution. The
stained sections were finally mounted in DPX Mountant.
Statistical analysis
Results were shown as mean ± SEM. The paired Student's
t test was used to analyze differences in variables before
and after treatment. Comparison between different groups
was performed using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by a Student-Newman-Keuls method.
P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Statistical analysis was performed by using Sigma Stat 3.5.
Results
Glycemic control
After the completion of the study protocol, glycemic con-
trol improved in both treatment groups during the study; a
similar proportion of animals in each treatment group
achieved a decrease in FBG, vildagliptin + telmisartan
(181.55 ± to 120 ± mg/dl, p < 0.001), and vildagliptin alone
(169.16 ± to 131 ± mg/dl, p < 0.01) as compared to the
diabetic group (Table 2; Figure 1).
Albumin excretion rate in urine
The vildagliptin + telmisartan treatment group showed a
significant decrease in urine albumin level (UAL) (96.02 ±
4.13 to 56.52 ± 2.45 mg/day, p < 0.001), while vildagliptin
alone caused a decrease in UAL (96.02 ± 4.13 to 69.66 ±
3.48 mg/dl, p < 0.001) as compared to the diabetic group
(Table 3; Figure 2).
Serum creatinine level
The vildagliptin + telmisartan treatment group showed a
significant decrease in serum creatinine level (206.69 ±
7.36 to 126.06 ± 7.51 µmol/l, p<0.001), while vildagliptin
alone caused a decrease in serum creatinine level (206.69 ±
7.36 to 141.23 ± µmol/l, p<0.01) as compared to the dia-
betic group (Table 4; Figure 3).
Body weight
During the study a significant increase in body weight was
observed in the metformin + glimepiride + pioglitazone
(control) group, while in the vildagliptin + telmisartan and
vildagliptin-only groups, no weight gain was seen as
compared to the diabetic group (Table 5; Figure 4).
BUN
BUN was significantly increased in the diabetic group
(20.91 ± 0.32 mg/dl to 105.66 ± 4.11 mg/dl, p<0.001) as
compared with the normal control group. There was a sig-
nificant decrease in BUN in the vildagliptin + telmisartan-
treated group (105.66 ± 4.11 mg/dl to 39.16 ± 3.93 mg/dl,
p < 0.001) compared with the untreated diabetic group
(Table 6; Figure 5).
Blood pressure measurement of different groups
Blood pressure was significantly increased in the diabetic
group (105.62 ± 2.72 mmHg diastolic; 145.85 ± 4.02

Histopathology study in different groups
Histopathological examination of kidney tissues was
performed at the end of the experiment. After 35 days of
examination, the rats were sacrificed by a single intraperito-
nial injection of kitamine. Light microscopy study in kidney
tissue sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin revealed glo-
merulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis, tubular vacuoliza-
tion (TV), thickening of the GBM, mesangial matrix
expansion (ME) and nodular lesion (NL). In the diabetic
group (Figure 8) maximum renovascular degeneration was
found, but in the treatment groups these changes were
attenuated. The vildagliptin plus telmisartan-treated group
(Figure 10) showed maximum renoprotection as compared
to vildagliptin alone (Figure 10) and the standard (pioglita-
zone + glemipiride + metformin)-treated group (Figure 9)
because of the absence of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial
fibrosis, NL and improvement of GBM thickness and
mesangial ME. In the diabetic group (Figure 8), increased
glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis, TV, thickening
of the GBM, mesangial ME and NL was observed as com-
pared to the normal group (Figure 7), but in the treatment
groups these changes were attenuated, possibly because of
the different drugs' renoprotective mechanisms.
Discussion
Captopril, lisinopril, quinapril and fosinopril are cur-
rently used ACE inhibitors to treat DN. ACE inhibitors
increase the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) and
activate nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) by inhibiting

synthesis of Ang II. Lisinopril inhibits the formation of
transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-ß) and tubuloint-
erstitial fibrosis in DN patients. Proteinuria, glomerular
hypertrophy and tubulointerstitial fibrosis were reduced
by fosinopril in experimental DN. Quinapril reduces
proteinuria, cholesterol levels, glomerular lesions and
podocyte damage in DN. AT1
ARBs like candesartan and
telmisartan have been noted to attenuate DN by reducing
proteinuria. ABT-62 and endothelin (ETA) receptor
antagonists have been noted to reduce proteinuria in
experimental DN.10,11
Palosuran, a novel and selective urotensin-II receptor
blocker, was noted to reduce albuminuria in renal disease.
Fenofibrate activates the peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor- (PPAR-) and produces a renoprotective effect
by suppressing renal plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1
(PAI-1) in experimental DN.12
PPAR- agonists such as pioglitazone and rosiglita-
zone significantly reduced glomerulosclerosis and tubu-
lointerstitial fibrosis in patients with DN. In addition,
pioglitazone markedly reduced glomerular hypertrophy,
mesangial expansion and urinary albumin excretion in
patients with DN.13

Recently it has been suggested that suppression of the
Rho-kinase pathway by fasudil, a selective Rho kinase
inhibitor, could be a novel strategy to treat DN by down-
regulating TGF-ß and reducing reactive oxygen species
(ROS) formation. Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl coen-
zyme A (HMG-CoA)-reductase by statins like atorvastatin,
pravastatin and cerivastatin was noted to activate eNOS,
maintain glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal cortical
blood flow and consequently reduce glomerular lesions.
Resveratrol, a polyphenolic phytoalexin and potent antioxi-
dant present in red wine, attenuated renal dysfunction by
reducing proteinuria and ROS formation in rats with DN.
On the basis of this discussion, it may be suggested that the
above-mentioned drugs may have improved renal function
in nephropathy because of their properties of protecting the
function of vascular endothelium.14
Our study has demonstrated that treatment with vilda-
gliptin and telmisartan significantly decreased FBG. The
antidiabetic activity of vildagliptin is due to improved
insulin secretion and peripheral insulin sensitivity. The
DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin is a novel class of antidiabetic
medication. Inhibition of DPP-4 by vildagliptin prevents
degradation of GLP-1 and reduces glycemia in patients
with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with a low risk for hypogly-
cemia and no weight gain. Vildagliptin binds covalently to
the catalytic site of DPP-4, eliciting prolonged enzyme
inhibition. This raises intact GLP-1 levels, both after meal
ingestion and in the fasting state.14
The combination of vildagliptin and telmisartan has
shown to significantly decrease symptoms of DN. Diabetic
rats treated with vildagliptin and telmisartan showed a
reduction in albumin excretion rate, serum creatinine rate,
BUN, FBG and renal structural changes. There were also
reported markedly changes in albuminuria, protenuria that
is a marker and potential contributor to renal injury that
accompanies DN. Interventions that have ameliorated the
progression of DN have been associated with a reduction in
urinary protein excretion.
Recent large landmark clinical studies have shown that
intensive glucose control reduces the risk of the develop-
ment and progression of DN, and the blockade RAS is
also an important target for both metabolic and hemody-
namic derangements in DN. It has been demonstrated that
treatment with telmisartan significantly decreases FBG.
The antidiabetic activity of telmisartan may be due to
improved glucose metabolism via blocking of the inhibi-
tory effect of Ang II on insulin signal transmission and
telmisartan's function as a moderately potent partial
PPAR- agonist activating the receptor to 25­30% of the
levels of the full agonists, such as the thiazolidinedione
agents. There are structural resemblances between the ARB
agents and the full PPAR- agonists, such as rosiglitazone
and pioglitazone.4
Renoprotective therapy should aim to achieve the maxi-
mal antialbuminuric effect. There are several mechanisms
whereby increased microalbuminuria and activation of the
RAS has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of
renal diseases. Hyperglycemia as an observed symptom in
diabetes greatly activates the RAS.Activation of RAS leads
to Ang II formation. AT-1 receptor stimulation by Ang II
may directly induce synthesis of TGF-1.Ang II, the effector
molecule of RAS, stimulates extracellular matrix protein
synthesis through induction of TGF-1 in mesangial cells,
renal interstitial fibroblasts and proximal tubular epithelial
cells. Thus, the reduction in plasma TGF-1 concentration
with telmisartan, demonstrated in the present study, may
reflect attenuated TGF-1 synthesis by all of these renal
cell types. Pro-inflammatory cytokines may play a signifi-
cant role in the development of renal injury in type 2 diabetes.
Therefore, results from experimental studies indicate that
inhibition of Ang II receptor activity is associated with
beneficial renal effects, suggesting that modulation of this
cytokine may have a real clinical application for the
treatment of DN.8,9
Blood pressure is the most important clinical driver/pro-
gression factor of DN. Careful monitoring is thus a must in
any DN study. In the present study, blood pressure in DN
rats was monitored. Vildagliptin has a poor blood pressure
effect, whereas the telmisartan group had better systolic
and diastolic blood pressure control. However, the combi-
nation of vildagliptin and telmisartan acts synergistically
and has the best control over blood pressure, glycemia and
DN markers. We have shown that the dual therapy of
vildagliptin and telmisartan resulted in a greater decrease
in blood glucose, albumin excretion rate, serum creatinine
rate, BUN and renal structural changes than treatment with
vildagliptin alone. The result of the present work was that
the combination of vildagliptin with telmisartan could be
more proficient in preventing STZ-induced type 2 DN than
an individual drug therapy or triple therapy, and our results
support our hypothesis. Histopathological findings also
have demonstrated recovery in glomerulosclerosis, intersti-
tial fibrosis, NL, TV, mesangial ME and thickening of
GBM by the combination of vildagliptin and telmisartan.
Conclusion
The hypothesis of the present work was to compare the dual
therapy of vildagliptin with telmisartan versus vildagliptin
alone on STZ-induced type 2 DN in rats. Our results show
that the combination of vildagliptin with telmisartan is
more effective in ameliorating DN than vildagliptin or
telmisartan single-drug therapy or triple therapy, by sup-
pressing blood pressure, albumin excretion rate in urine,
total serum creatinine rate and BUN during the develop-
ment of STZ-induced type 2 DN. Finally, the significant
effect of combined therapy (vildagliptin plus telmisartan)
could be a result of synergistic/potentiative action on the
RAS, and together they may be able to target multiple
mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of DN.
