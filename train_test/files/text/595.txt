Summary
This study examined whether physical, social, cultural and economical environ-
mental factors are associated with obesogenic dietary behaviours and overweight/
obesity among adults. Literature searches of databases (i.e. PubMed, CSA
Illumina, Web of Science, PsychInfo) identified studies examining environmental
factors and the consumption of energy, fat, fibre, fruit, vegetables, sugar-
sweetened drinks, meal patterns and weight status. Twenty-eight studies were
in-scope, the majority (n = 16) were conducted in the USA. Weight status was
consistently associated with the food environment; greater accessibility to super-
markets or less access to takeaway outlets were associated with a lower BMI or
prevalence of overweight/obesity. However, obesogenic dietary behaviours did not
mirror these associations; mixed associations were found between the environ-
ment and obesogenic dietary behaviours. Living in a socioeconomically-deprived
area was the only environmental factor consistently associated with a number of
obesogenic dietary behaviours. Associations between the environment and weight
status are more consistent than that seen between the environment and dietary
behaviours. The environment may play an important role in the development of
overweight/obesity, however the dietary mechanisms that contribute to this
remain unclear and the physical activity environment may also play an important
role in weight gain, overweight and obesity.

Introduction
Obesity is a major cause of morbidity and mortality from
chronic diseases such as cardiovascular and musculoskel-
etal diseases, some cancers and negative psychological well-
being (1,2). The prevalence of overweight and obesity is
high and ranges from 40% to 60% among adults in devel-
oped countries (2,3). In the last two decades there have
been marked increases in the prevalence of overweight and
obesity (4). Overweight and obesity results in substantial
health and economic burdens, and these negative conse-
quences are predicted to escalate as the population ages
(5,6).
Overweight and obesity are the result of positive energy
balance. Low levels of physical activity and/or dietary
behaviours that deviate from recommendations are thought
to contribute to the epidemic of obesity. In terms of dietary
factors, population trends in overweight and obesity would
suggest that energy intake exceeds energy expenditure (7).
High energy intakes have been associated with higher fat

intakes, greater intakes of energy-dense foods, including
takeaway foods, higher intakes of foods providing `empty
calories' (e.g. sugar-sweetened drinks), lower intakes of
foods and nutrients that may have appetite-controlling
properties (i.e. fruit and vegetables, fibre) and meal patterns
that interfere with the regulation of energy intakes (e.g.
skipping breakfast) (7). Despite the health-related benefits
of consuming a diet that promotes a healthy weight, many
adults do not consume a diet consistent with these recom-
mendations. Population-level dietary estimates show that
fat intakes exceed recommendations by at least 10%, the
majority of the population do not consume sufficient fruit,
vegetables or fibre and a significant proportion of the popu-
lation skip meals (8­11).
Given the rapid rise in overweight and obesity among
populations of developed countries, many health practitio-
ners and health researchers have postulated that the envi-
ronment, rather than individual-level factors, may be
driving the obesity epidemic. Policymakers are increasingly
considering environments for the development of policy,
however, have been limited by insufficient research docu-
menting the role of the environment. Recent studies have
shown that overweight and obesity cluster within areas,
suggesting that shared environments may contribute to a
positive energy balance (12­14). The postulated relation-
ships between the environment and weight status is shown
in Fig. 1. The current review primarily focuses on environ-
mental factors that may influence dietary behaviours. `Obe-
sogenic' food environments are thought to facilitate high
energy intakes by increasing access to stores that promote
unhealthy food choices, such as takeaway and fast food
shops, convenience stores and other outlets that are less
likely to sell healthy food choices (15­17). Areas charac-
terized by obesogenic food environments may also be asso-
ciated with physical activity environments that promote
decreased energy expenditure and sedentariness. The pre-
sumed importance of these environmental factors has
resulted in a myriad of policies and interventions aimed at
improving food environments (4,18,19). Despite wide-
spread support for these policies and interventions, the
discourse about their supposed importance has largely been
discussed in position papers and narrative reviews, without
synthesis of the evidence on how food environments
are associated with overweight and obesity and the
mechanisms by which environmental factors contribute to
overweight/obesity.
Two systematic reviews examining environmental corre-
lates of obesogenic dietary intakes were conducted in 2004
(20,21). At this stage, there were few replicated studies that
examined associations between obesogenic dietary intakes
and the food environment. Given the increased research
activity on environmental determinants of health-related
behaviours in recent years, we sought to review the more
recent literature on how features of the food environment
are associated with both dietary intakes and overweight/
obesity to identify factors to be targeted in policy and
interventions to reduce overweight/obesity and to ascertain
how shared environments may contribute to the obesity
epidemic.
Method
Study scope
This review focused on studies of dietary intakes among
adults (i.e. 18 years). The prevalence of overweight and
obesity is greatest in adulthood (especially middle-age),
and significant weight gains continue to occur in early and
middle adulthood (6). The review examined studies con-
ducted among developed countries, as defined by the World
Bank (22).
Environmental factors
For the purposes of this study, the environment was defined
as physical and infrastructural features of areas. A frame-
work used in previous reviews (20,21,23) was used to
guide the classification of different environmental factors
during the review process. The framework shares common
features with ecological models (24,25), stressing the
importance of multiple types of environmental influences.
The four categories that form this framework are:
1. Accessibility and availability. Including physical and
financial accessibility of products and shops that are needed
for an (un)healthy diet (e.g. access to shops, and availability
of high fat foods and less healthy snacks);
2. Social conditions. These arise from inter-personal
interactions (e.g. marketing) and social support;

3. Material conditions. Including unfavourable
working, housing and neighbourhood conditions (e.g.
neighbourhood deprivation).
These may affect behaviour through one of the previous
environmental factors. For instance, living or working in an
unfavourable environment might induce stress, which may
relate to indifference concerning a healthy diet.
Obesogenic dietary factors
Dietary factors influence overweight/obesity through the
energy balance pathway; excess energy intake is arguably
the most important dietary factor in relation to weight gain
and the development of overweight/obesity (26). As there
are physiological limitations on the quantity of food/drink
that can be consumed by individuals, excess energy intakes
are often the consequence of energy-dense diets (i.e. high in
kilojoules per unit weight) (7). Population-based studies
have shown that energy-dense diets are characterized by:
high intakes of fat and sugar, and low intakes of water-
holding factors, such as fibre, fruit and vegetables, high
intakes of sugar-sweetened beverages (e.g. soft drinks) and
irregular meal patterns (27­30). These factors are sus-
pected to contribute to overriding the normal physiological
regulation of appetite and food intakes, and are associated
with weight gain and overweight/obesity (6,26,29,31,32).
Therefore, the dietary factors examined in this review
included intakes of energy, total fat, fibre, fruit, vegetables,
sugar-sweetened beverages and meal patterns.
Weight status
Any measure of weight status, including absolute weight
or any equivilized weight scale such as body mass index
(BMI), weight for height or categorization of weight status
into groups was included in the current study.
Search strategy
Databases and search terms
A review protocol based on guidelines from the Cochrane
Reviewer's Handbook (33) was used. Studies conducted
among human subjects between 1 January 2005 and 1
October 2008 were located by searches of several major
databases (i.e. PubMed, CSA Illumina, Web of Science and
PsychInfo).
Broad search terms were used in the database searches
to ensure that all potentially relevant articles entered
the screening process. Each database was searched using
database-specific indexing terms; suitable search terms
were selected from lists of the database indexing system.
For databases that did not have their own indexing terms
(i.e. CSA Illumina) we searched for keywords in titles. The
sensitivity of searches was tested by examining whether
they located several key articles. The searches yielded 6014
potentially relevant titles (3580 in PubMed, 84 in CSA
Illumina, 2322 in Web of Science and 28 in PsychInfo). The
search terms and syntax used for each database are avail-
able from the authors on request.
Inclusion criteria
This review only included studies published in the peer-
reviewed literature. Therefore, information from web sites,
reports and conference abstracts were not included. Studies
must have been published in English and conducted among
a population-based sample (i.e. studies examining disease
or patient sub-groups were excluded) of adults (i.e. 18
years of age). They must have examined at least one of the
in-scope dietary factors, which could be summarized either
as quantity consumed (e.g. grams of fruit consumed per
day), frequency of consumption (e.g. how many times fruit
was consumed per week) or compliance with recommen-
dations (e.g. whether consumed two or more portions of
fruit per day) or weight status. In-scope studies were
required to have assessed at least one environmental factor.
Studies that combined in-scope dietary factors with out-of-
scope factors into summary indices of diet (e.g. dietary
outcomes derived from factor analyses) were excluded as
associations with the obesogenic dietary factors could not
be distinguished from other dietary factors.
Title scanning
The title screening process was performed by two reviewers
(KG and FvL), and took place in three steps. First, the titles
located from the search results were scanned, to exclude
those out of the scope of the current study. Fifty-five studies
were selected at this stage. Subsequently, the Abstracts of
all titles were independently examined by the two review-
ers. At this step, each reviewer read all study abstracts, and
produced a list of in-scope articles. Discrepancies between
reviewers in the selected articles were discussed, and a
consensus was reached on whether or not the article(s) in
question would be incorporated. A total of 31 articles were
identified for inclusion at this stage. Third, the reference
lists of these articles were scanned and literature searches
on major authors in the area were performed, a further five
publications were included at this step. Seven manuscripts
were subsequently excluded at the data extraction phase
due to not meeting scope/inclusion criteria of the study.
Therefore, 28 articles were included in the current review.
Data extraction and summary
Study details (i.e. country, study name, sample size,
response rate, dietary assessment method, dietary/weight
status outcome variable, environmental measure and the
direction and magnitude of associations found) were sum-
marized in data extraction tables. Because each study was

designed to address different outcomes and associations,
we reported associations adjusted for the relevant con-
founders (i.e. gender, age), where available. Some studies
examined associations with more than one outcome of
interest, in which case they were considered in more than
one data extraction table.
Differences in intakes between environmental factors
were ascertained by statistical significance and clinically
relevant differences. In terms of clinically relevant differ-
ences, a 3% relative difference in energy intakes between
groups equates to a weight gain of 2­4 kg year-1 for an
average-sized adult (26), therefore differences of this mag-
nitude are likely to have a marked long-term influence on
BMI and overweight/obesity. Studies have shown that a
10% reduction in total fat intake is associated with
a reduction in weight of 1.5­2 kg year-1 (34). Likewise, a
10% increase in dietary fibre intakes is estimated to con-
tribute to a weight loss of 1.5­2 kg year-1 (26). Greater
fruit and vegetable intakes are associated with a lower body
weight among adults; however, there is insufficient evidence
examining the magnitude of weight changes associated
with intakes (35). Therefore, an arbitrary cut-off of a 10%
difference in intakes of fruits and vegetables was used.
The magnitude of differences between environmental
exposures was ascertained by calculating the relative dif-
ference between groups differing in their exposure to the
environmental factor. This was calculated by:

Odds ratio estimates for differences were reported for
dichotomous outcome variables.
Relative differences were considered small if they were
10% (or OR 0.80­1.0), moderate if relative differences
were 10­20% (or OR 0.70­0.80) and large if relative
differences were 20% (or OR  0.70).
Findings
The characteristics of the 28 studies included in the review
are shown in Table 1. Twenty-three of these were con-
ducted among separate study samples, and five studies were
sourced from two study populations. The vast majority of
in-scope studies (n = 16) were conducted in the USA, with
other studies taking place in Australia or New Zealand
(n = 7) and Japan (n = 2). Three Australian studies were
sourced from one sample (SESAW), and two American
studies were sourced from one sample (Stanford Heart
Disease Prevention Program). Only three of the studies
were conducted in Europe ­ two of these were among
British samples (16,36) and one among a Dutch sample
(37). With the exception of one natural experiment (16), all
studies were cross-sectional. Study sample sizes ranged
from 102 to 714 054 participants, with the majority of
studies (n = 22) having sample sizes above 1000 partici-
pants. Response rates ranged from 10% to 87%, just under
one half of the studies had response rates of 60% and one
quarter (n = 7) did not report response rates.
Most studies (n = 13) examined fruit and vegetable con-
sumption, two investigated energy intakes, six assessed fat
intakes and three examined fibre intakes. Four of the
in-scope studies examined takeaway or fast food consump-
tion and three studies explored meal patterns (i.e. breakfast
consumption and/or the regularity of meals). No study
examined environmental factors in relation to the consump-
tion of sugar-rich beverages. Eight studies assessed associa-
tions between environmental factors and weight status.
Most (n = 18) examined accessibility factors; social
factors and material factors were explored in three and
seven studies, respectively. Only two studies looked at asso-
ciations between cultural factors and obesogenic dietary
intakes. The majority of studies used food frequency ques-
tionnaires to ascertain dietary intakes and measured height
and weight to assess weight status. Most (n = 16) measured
environmental factors using objective measures, nine
studies assessed environmental factors using self-reported
information and the remaining three studies used a combi-
nation of objective and self-reported data.
Accessibility factors
Associations between accessibility factors and obesogenic
dietary intakes or weight status are shown in Table 2.
For fruit and vegetable consumption, access to supermar-
kets, grocery/convenience, takeaway and fruit and veg-
etable stores was examined in 14 associations. The number
of associations measured was greatest and most consistent
for access to supermarkets; five out of six associations
found that greater accessibility to supermarkets was not
associated with fruit and vegetable consumption. Three
out of four associations assessing access to takeaway
outlets and fruit and vegetable consumption showed no
significant/meaningful differences. Furthermore, there were
no consistent associations between availability/shelf space
of fruits and vegetables and their consumption.
Five associations measured differences in weight status
by access to supermarkets; four of these found that people
with greater access to supermarkets had lower BMI/
prevalence of overweight/obesity compared with those with
less access. These differences were small-to-moderate in
magnitude (i.e. differences of between 1­35%). The major-
ity of associations (five out of eight) examining access to
takeaway food outlets and weight status found that greater
access was associated with greater BMI/prevalence of
overweight/obesity. However, associations with access to

grocery/convenience stores were found to be mixed. Five
associations looked at takeaway consumption in relation to
takeaway outlets, shelf space and prices of healthy foods,
and also found no association with takeaway consumption.
Another five associations examined access to restaurants/
cafes and weight status, three of these found no differences
in weight status by access.
Social factors
Table 2 summarizes associations between social factors and
dietary intakes or weight status. There were mixed associa-
tions found between social support and fruit and vegetable
consumption. Only one study examined community par-
ticipation, and found no association with fruit and veg-
etable consumption.
Cultural factors
Associations between cultural factors and obesogenic
dietary intakes are summarized in Table 3. Only two
studies were located, and these found mixed associations
with TV viewing and consumption of fruit and vegetables
or takeaway foods (Table 4).
Material factors
Study findings examining associations between material
factors and obesogenic dietary intakes are shown in
Table 5.
The two studies examining area deprivation and fruit
and vegetable consumption found that living in a socioeco-
nomically advantaged area was associated with greater
fruit and vegetable consumption or a higher likelihood of
their consumption. Only two studies looked at fruit and
vegetable consumption in relation to urban/rural residence
and shift work; these found that residing in a rural area and
not being a shift worker were associated with higher fruit
and vegetable intakes.
There was only one study examining associations in
takeaway consumption with each of the following material
factors: area deprivation, urban/rural residence and receipt

of welfare. Only living in an urban area was associated
with higher takeaway consumption. Two associations that
examined area deprivation and meal patterns found that
living in a socioeconomically advantaged area was associ-
ated with more regular meal patterns.
Discussion
We conducted a systematic review of the literature exam-
ining environmental factors associated with obesogenic
dietary intakes and overweight/obesity. Weight status was
most consistently associated with features of the environ-
ment; residents of areas with greater access to supermarkets
or lower accessibility to takeaway outlets had a lower
prevalence of overweight/obesity compared with those
living in areas with limited supermarket access or a greater
accessibility to takeaway outlets. Paradoxically however,
the findings of studies examining environmental factors in
relation to obesogenic dietary behaviours were less consis-
tent, with mixed associations reported. The only exception
to this was area-level deprivation, with residents of socio-
economically deprived areas having a greater likelihood
of obesogenic dietary intakes than their counterparts in
advantaged areas.
The current review updated two systematic reviews con-
ducted in 2004 that examined environmental correlates
of energy, fat, fruit and vegetable intakes (20,21). These
previous reviews found that most studies focussed on
work conditions and seasonal/day-of-the-week variations
in dietary intakes. However, the current review found an
increasing amount of research that examined accessibility
factors (i.e. locations of supermarkets, takeaway food
stores, availability of healthy food choices within stores)
and area-level socioeconomic deprivation than reported in
previous reviews. Furthermore, we found a greater number
of studies that examined these environmental factors in
relation to the distal outcome, weight status, rather than
the more `intermediate' outcome of dietary intakes.
Greater access to takeaway outlets may increase the ease
at which people make food choices less consistent with
dietary recommendations by minimizing barriers to making
these choices (15,38). A limited access to supermarkets
may result in reliance on convenience stores or takeaway
outlets; these stores tend to sell foods less consistent with
long-term health (16,39,40). Living in a socioeconomically
deprived area may influence dietary behaviours by limiting
access to supermarkets (through lower servicing of these
areas by supermarkets or lower access to transport) and
increasing access to corner/convenience stores (40). This
later association is predominantly seen in the USA,
however, is not consistently observed in other countries
(41). Despite an increase in research examining accessibility
factors, relatively few studies have examined other environ-
mental factors implicated in the obesity epidemic, such as:
portion sizes and the marketing of energy-dense foods
(4,18).
We found more consistent evidence of associations
between environmental factors and weight status than
studies examining associations between environmental
factors and dietary intakes. If the environment is hypoth-
esized to influence weight status, we would expect to find
an association between environmental factors and diet, and
between environmental factors and weight status. A poten-
tial explanation of this finding is that environmental factors
may influence BMI through a more complex interplay of
factors, including physical activity, which has not been well

explored in other studies. However, this is difficult to ascer-
tain as no known studies have assessed features of the
environment, dietary intakes, physical activity and weight
status simultaneously. This may also be due (in part) to the
complexity in measuring dietary intakes and physical activ-
ity; calculating these requires accurate recall and descrip-
tion of dietary intakes and physical activity (42). This is
particularly difficult to achieve in studies of population-
representative samples, where the self-administered data
collection methods frequently used generally involve a high
degree of participant burden (42). Furthermore, obesogenic
food and physical activity environments may co-exist,
making it difficult to attribute which feature of the envi-
ronment contributes to the development of overweight and
obesity. This is an area that requires increased research
activity to disentangle the pathways that contribute to the
spatial patterning in weight status in urban areas that has
been documented in a number of studies from North
America (13,43,44), Europe (45) and Australia (12).
The majority of studies included in the current review
were conducted in the USA, UK or Australia/New Zealand.
It is therefore unclear whether findings from this review can
be generalized to other regions. Previous research has
shown that the USA represents an anomaly with respect to
the geographic size of urban areas and the residential seg-
regation of socioeconomic and ethnic groups compared
with other developed countries (41,46). This has raised the
issue of whether the associations seen between environmen-
tal factors and dietary behaviours in the USA are relevant
to other developed countries, especially in the European
region (41).
This study considered a number of dietary outcomes;
however, the findings showed that associations between
obesogenic dietary behaviours and environmental factors
have been studied most frequently for fruit and vegetable
intakes. This may be because fruit and vegetable consump-
tion is positively associated with other healthy dietary
intakes and behaviours, such as intakes that are less energy
dense, lower in fat, higher in fibre and less frequent con-
sumption of fast food (20,47). However, it is likely that
environmental factors are associated with each nutrient,
food group or dietary intake pattern differentially (18,20).
For example, accessibility to fruit and vegetable shops may
influence fruit, vegetable and fibre consumptions; however,
it is less plausible that accessibility to fruit and vegetable
shops may influence the consumption of sugar-rich bever-
ages or meal patterns. Therefore, it is important for future
research to investigate environmental influences on all
dietary factors that may contribute to obesogenic dietary
intakes.
Several limitations of our review must be considered in
light of our findings. Our search strategy only located
studies that were published in peer-reviewed journals and
referenced in electronic databases, excluding `grey' litera-
ture. We tried to minimize any potential bias that may be
induced from only examining peer-reviewed literature by
also performing searches in smaller and more specialized
databases (e.g. CSA Illumina). There was also great varia-
tion between studies included in the current review in terms
of the conceptualization, measurement and summary of
both the environmental factors and dietary behaviours
which may have contributed to heterogeneous findings.
Furthermore, although strict inclusion criteria were used,
environmental or dietary intake measures sometimes dif-
fered markedly between studies. Little is known about
appropriate confounders to adjust for when examining
associations between environmental factors and dietary
intakes/weight status (20). Some studies may have `over-
corrected' for such factors, which may diminish the mag-
nitude or significance of associations with environmental
factors. Whereas other studies that did not correct for
appropriate individual-level confounders and therefore
may over-estimate the strength or significance of these asso-
ciations. Furthermore, most of the studies included in this
review were cross-sectional, making it difficult to ascertain
causality between environmental factors and obesogenic
dietary intakes.
The current review suggested that accessibility to
supermarkets/takeaway outlets or residing in a socioeco-
nomically deprived area are environmental factors that
may contribute to overweight or obesity and/or obesogenic
dietary behaviours. These factors need to be targeted in
multilevel health promotion interventions and policies
aimed at decreasing overweight/obesity. The role of other
environmental factors, however, should not be discarded
without further investigation, namely those whose associa-
tions with dietary behaviours/weight status were not exam-
ined or are not possible to infer from the limited number of
studies. Despite the limitations in the evidence base to date,
we should not refrain from policies and interventions
promoting healthy environments because waiting for such
evidence to emerge before action is taken may simply rep-
resent a delay to addressing the obesity epidemic. To under-
stand the role of environmental factors, studies are required
that simultaneously examine a broad range of environmen-
tal factors, obesogenic dietary behaviours and physical
activity and that utilize prospective study designs.
