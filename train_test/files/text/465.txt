Purpose: This article examines the extent to
which positive and negative support from children
prior to and after spousal loss and changes in sup-
port from pre- to post-loss affect widowed older
adults' depressive symptoms, anxiety, and anger
18 months following widowhood. Design and
Methods: Analyses are based on the Changing
Lives of Older Couples, a prospective study of 1,532
married individuals aged 65 years and older. The ana-
lytic sample includes 148 widowed persons who have
at least one living child and participated in the base-
line and two follow-up interviews conducted 6 and
18 months following widowhood. Results: The
analyses revealed that higher levels of positive sup-
port from children 6 months following widowhood
were associated with fewer depressive symptoms at
the 18-month follow-up, whereas higher levels of
negative support 18 months after loss and a decrease
in positive support following loss were associated
with more depressive symptoms. Greater negative
support both prior to and after loss was associated
with greater anxiety, whereas greater negative
support 6 months after loss and an increase in neg-
ative support following loss were related to greater
anger. Implications: Given their differential im-
pact on widowed persons' psychological adjustment,
both positive and negative aspects of social support
as well as its changing nature should be considered
in working with bereaved older adults.
Key Words: Spousal bereavement, Grief, Negative

Although widowhood is an extremely stressful
life event (M. S. Stroebe, Hansson, Stroebe, &
Schut, 2001), clinical studies note significant varia-
tions among widowed individuals in their capacity
to cope with the distress of widowhood. Although
most people recover from major depression within
1 year after losing a spouse, some people experi-
ence prolonged depressive and grief symptoms
over an extended period (Beem, Maes, Cleiren,
Schut, & Garssen, 2000; Onrust & Cuijpers,
2006).
In search of a social mechanism that explains
this variation, many studies have examined the
role of social support in adaptation to widowhood
(Norris & Murrell, 1990; Silverstein & Bengtson,
1994; W. Stroebe, Stroebe, Abakoumkin, & Schut,
1996; W. Stroebe, Zech, & Stroebe, 2005; van
Baarsen, 2002). In particular, much research has
investigated whether preexisting social support
protects (i.e., buffers) one from experiencing severe
psychological outcomes upon spousal loss (Norris &
Murrell; W. Stroebe et al., 1996) and whether
social support accelerates recovery from distress
(W. Stroebe et al., 2005). However, few studies
have explored how changes in social relationships

following widowhood, especially in terms of nega-
tive social interactions, influence widowed persons'
psychological adjustment.
The purpose of this article was to examine the
extent to which widowed older adults' positive
and negative support from adult children influence
their coping with depressive and grief-related
symptoms (i.e., anxiety and anger) over the course
of bereavement. Particular attention is given to
two important issues that are not sufficiently ad-
dressed in the previous literature: (a) longitudinal
effects of positive and negative support and (b) im-
plications of changes in positive and negative sup-
port following widowhood. In the following
section, I elaborate on these overlooked issues and
review relevant literature.
Effect of Positive and Negative Support on
Widowed Persons' Psychological Adjustment
The first objective of this article is to investigate
both the concurrent and the lagged effects of
positive and negative support from children on
widowed older adults' psychological adjustment.
Previous research suggests that close social relation-
ships, such as parent­child relationships, consist of
not only positive but also negative social exchanges
(Akiyama, Antonucci, Takahashi, & Langfahl, 2003;
Birditt, Miller, Fingerman, & Lefkowitz, 2009).
A significant body of literature also suggests that
these two aspects of social support are not at
opposite ends of the spectrum (Rook, 1984) and
that each aspect has a distinct impact on older
adults' well-being (Ingersoll-Dayton, Morgan, &
Antonucci, 1997; Lincoln, 2008).
Positive and negative support can exert unique
influences on widowed persons' psychological ad-
justment as well. On the one hand, positive sup-
port from children can help older adults better
cope with the loss through decreased feelings of
loneliness and isolation (Rook, 1984). On the oth-
er hand, negative support, such as demands and
criticism, can create the feelings of unhappiness
and ambivalence toward children among widowed
parents (Talbott, 1990), which may lead to in-
creased psychological distress.
In the past two decades, a growing body of
literature has examined how positive and nega-
tive aspects of social relationships differentially
affect psychological well-being. Some of the key
findings of this literature are that negative aspects
of social relationships, in general, have more po-
tent effects than positive social relationships on
psychological well-being (Newsom, Nishishiba,
Morgan, & Rook, 2003; Schuster, Kessler, &
Aseltine, 1990) and that negative exchanges are
more distressing for people who have experi-
enced many life events (Ingersoll-Dayton et al.,
1997). However, very few studies have investi-
gated this issue specifically among widowed older
adults, and most of the existing studies are based
on cross-sectional data.
Among the studies that focus on widowed older
adults, a cross-sectional study found that negative
social interactions have a more potent effect than
do positive interactions on the life satisfaction of
older widows (Rook, 1984). In terms of loneliness,
however, this study found that positive interac-
tions exerted a stronger influence than negative
ones, suggesting that positive and negative social
support may have a differential impact depending
on the outcome.
Among the studies that use samples drawn from
the general population, a handful of studies have
examined how the effects of positive and negative
support change over time using longitudinal data.
Based on a sample of community-dwelling older
adults, Finch and Zautra (1992) found that in pre-
dicting concurrent depression, both positive and
negative support were significant. However, in
predicting depression assessed 1 month later, they
found only negative support was significant. In an-
other longitudinal study of older adults, Newsom,
Mahan, and Rook (2008)) found that stable nega-
tive social exchanges have a significant negative
impact on physical health outcomes both concur-
rently and 2 years later. However, they did not ex-
amine the relative effects of positive versus negative
social exchanges on health.
Despite growing utilization of longitudinal data
in examining the impact of positive and negative
support, no study has yet specifically investigated
the extent to which positive and negative support
from children both prior to and after spousal loss
affect widowed persons' ability to cope with the
distress of losing a spouse over time. With cross-
sectional data, we cannot exclude the possibility of
a reverse causation--that initial levels of psycho-
logical distress among widowed older adults may
have led to greater negativity in social relation-
ships, rather than vice versa (Newsom et al., 2003;
Rook, 1997). Thus, by using prospective data on
bereavement, the current study aims to enhance
the understanding of the longitudinal associations
of positive and negative support from children with
widowed older adults' psychological adaptation.
Vol. 50, No. 4, 2010 473
Specifically, two hypotheses are proposed. First,
consistent with the findings from previous litera-
ture (Newsom et al., 2003), it is hypothesized that
higher levels of positive and lower levels of nega-
tive support from adult children will be associated
with lower psychological distress among older
widowed persons both concurrently and in the
long term. Second, given previous findings that
negative exchanges are especially detrimental
when individuals are experiencing multiple stresses
(Ingersoll-Dayton et al., 1997), it is hypothesized
that negative support from adult children will exert
a greater influence on widowed persons' psycho-
logical adjustment than will positive support.
Effects of Changes in Social Support Following
Spousal Loss
Another important gap in the current literature
on positive and negative support is that previous
research has rarely paid attention to the implica-
tions of the changing nature of social relation-
ships during a stressful life transition. Even in the
vast literature focusing on the beneficial effects of
social support, most previous studies have exam-
ined how preexisting or currently existing social
support protects widowed persons from experi-
encing severe psychological outcomes, without
considering the effect of changes in social support
following spousal loss (Wethington & Kessler,
1986).
One reason for this dearth of research focusing
on the impact of changes in social support may be
that researchers have conceptualized social sup-
port as a resource that remains stable over time.
In fact, much theoretical and empirical work in
previous literature suggests that people maintain a
stable network of close social relationships
(Carstensen, 1992) from which they can draw
support. However, the quality of social relation-
ships may change during times of stressful life
transitions (Guiaux, van Tilburg, & van Groenou,
2007; Ha, 2008), and such changes may have an
impact on the psychological well-being of older
adults.
Research has shown that, shortly after widow-
hood, older adults experience an increase in posi-
tive and a decrease in negative support from
children (Ha & Ingersoll-Dayton, 2008). Further-
more, bereaved older adults use strategies such as
revitalization of old social ties and development of
new ties to compensate for their loss (Zettel &
Rook, 2004). However, few studies have looked
into the implications of these changes in social re-
lationships. Zettel and Rook note that older adults'
substitution of social ties following widowhood
does not necessarily lead to better psychological
well-being. However, to date, no study has fol-
lowed this line of research to examine whether or
how positive and negative support from adult
children affect widowed persons' psychological
outcomes.
Given that the parent­child relationship is one
of the most enduring relationships of all, under-
standing the ways in which changes in relation-
ships with children following spousal loss influence
older adults' psychological well-being is critical.
The different ways that children respond to spou-
sal loss and how widowed persons perceive these
responses may have important implications for
widowed persons' psychological adjustment. Thus,
the current study examines the effect of changes in
support from children on widowed parents' psy-
chological outcomes. It is hypothesized that those
who experienced an increase in positive support
and a decrease in negative support 6 months fol-
lowing widowhood will show lower psychological
distress 18 months after spousal loss. On the
other hand, those who experienced a decrease in
positive support and an increase in negative sup-
port will show greater psychological distress at
the 18-month follow-up.
Methods
Sample
Analyses are based on data from the Changing
Lives of Older Couples (CLOC; Carr & Utz, 2002),
a prospective study of a two-stage area probability
sample of 1,532 married men and women from the
Detroit area. To be eligible for the study, respon-
dents had to be English-speaking members of a
married couple in which the husband was aged 65
years or older. Sample members were community
dwelling and were capable of participating in a
2-hr face-to-face interview. Baseline interviews
were conducted between June 1987 and April
1988. Approximately 68% of those contacted par-
ticipated in the interview.
After baseline interviews, CLOC researchers
monitored spousal loss by reading the daily obitu-
aries in three Detroit-area newspapers and by using
monthly death records provided by the state of
Michigan. The National Death Index was used to
confirm the deaths and obtain the causes of death.
Of the 319 respondents who lost a spouse during
The Gerontologist
474
the study, 86% (n = 276) participated in at least
one of the follow-up interviews conducted 6 months
(Wave 1), 18 months (Wave 2), and 48 months
(Wave 3) after the death. The primary reasons for
nonresponse were refusal to participate (38%) and
ill-health or death at follow-up (42%).
The analytic sample of this article focuses on
148 widowed persons who participated in the
Wave 1 and the Wave 2 interviews and had at least
one living child. This sample comprises approxi-
mately 65.7% of all widowed persons who par-
ticipated either in the Wave 1 or in the Wave 2
interviews (n = 225). Of 225 individuals, 47 people
participated in the Wave 1 interview only and 14
people participated in the Wave 2 interview only.
Attrition analysis showed that respondents who
are older, have greater functional difficulty, and
are more depressed at Wave 1 showed lower pro-
pensity to participate in the Wave 2 interview,
given participation in the Wave 1 interview (t-test
results were significant at a = .05). For this reason,
findings may not be generalizable to the oldest old
or widowed persons with severe functional diffi-
culty or depressive symptoms. Also, the attrition
of those who are severely depressed at Wave 1 may
lessen the variability in depressive symptoms
among the resulting sample and thus reduce the
power to detect the effects of positive and negative
support on depressive symptoms at Wave 2. Data
from Wave 3 interviews were not included because
only 83 widowed respondents participated in all
three follow-up interviews. The sample sizes are
weighted to account for nonresponse and different
probabilities of selection.
Measures
Dependent Variables.--One general (depressive
symptoms) and two grief-related symptoms (anger
and anxiety) are used as dependent variables. The
depressive symptoms variable at Wave 2 (a = .81)
consists of a subset of 11 (9 negative and 2 posi-
tive) items from the 20-item Center for Epidemio-
logical Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale (Radloff,
1977). The scale is standardized on the mean and
standard deviation of the baseline sample. Higher
scores reflect more depressive symptoms. Anxiety
at Wave 2 (a = .71) was assessed with the fol-
lowing three items: (a) afraid of what is ahead,
(b) felt anxious or unsettled, and (c) worried
about how you would manage your day-to-day
affairs. Anger at Wave 2 (a = .68) was assessed
with the following three items: (a) felt resentful
or bitter about your spouse's death, (b) felt that
the death of your spouse was unfair, and (c) felt
anger toward God. Both anxiety and anger as-
sessed grief symptoms during the past month
and response categories included (a) no, never;
(b) yes, but rarely; (c) yes, sometimes; and (d) yes,
often. Higher scores reflect higher levels of anxiety
and anger.
Independent Variables.--The analysis controls
for depressive symptoms, anxiety, and anger at
Wave 1 in order to capture changes between Wave
1 and Wave 2. These measures are assessed with
the same items as at Wave 2.
"Positive support from children" (a = .70 at
baseline) is assessed with the following questions:
"How much do your children make you feel
loved and cared for?" and "How much are they
willing to listen when you need to talk about
your worries or problems?" Response categories
are a great deal, quite a bit, some, a little, and
not at all. The scale is standardized based on the
mean and standard deviation of the baseline
sample. Higher scores indicate greater positive
support.
"Negative support from children" (a = .48 at
baseline) is assessed with the following questions:
"How much do you feel they make too many de-
mands on you?" and "How much are they critical
of you or what you do?" Response categories are
the same as the positive support items. The scale is
standardized, and higher scores indicate greater
negative support. The measures of positive and
negative support are assessed at baseline, Wave 1,
and Wave 2 using the same questions.
The measure of negative support from children
has low reliability, likely due to the fact that the
scale tries to capture diverse aspects of negative so-
cial interactions (e.g., being critical and demand-
ing) in one measure, resulting in low internal
consistency reliability. In order to address this is-
sue, I conducted a supplementary analysis with in-
dividual components of this scale (i.e., demands
and criticism). This result is summarized in the
Discussion section. Although a low reliability
makes it harder to detect the significant relation-
ship between independent and dependent variables
by attenuating the correlations between them, the
broader range of content may increase the validity
of the measure in covering various dimensions of
social support. Thus, a composite scale is used in
the main analysis.
Vol. 50, No. 4, 2010 475
"Changes in positive and negative support" from
baseline (prior to loss) to the Wave 1 (6-month
follow-up) interview are assessed first by subtract-
ing the Wave 1 support score from the baseline sup-
port score (unstandardized scores are used for this
calculation). Then, two dummy variables are cre-
ated to capture those who experienced an increase
in support and those who experienced a decrease in
support. The reference category includes those who
did not experience any changes in positive and neg-
ativesupport,respectively(i.e.,baselinescore-Wave
1 score = 0). Changes in positive and negative sup-
port from the Wave 1 (6-month follow-up) inter-
view to the Wave 2 (18-month follow-up) interview
are also considered in the preliminary analyses but
none of these indicators showed significant effects.
Thus, these results are not reported in this article
(results are available from the author).
Confounding Factors.--The analysis controlled
for four possible confounding factors (i.e., sudden-
ness of death, coresidence status of children, atten-
dance at religious services, and functional
limitations) that are closely linked to psychological
adaptation to loss (Brown, Nesse, House, & Utz,
2004; Ha & Carr, 2005; Krause, 1991). Sudden-
ness of death is a dichotomous variable where 1
indicates that the spouse's death occurred either
due to accident, murder, or suicide or the respon-
dent did not have any forewarning about the death
and 0 indicates that the respondent had a fore-
warning about the death. Presence of a coresident
child(ren) at Wave 2 is a dichotomous variable
where 1 indicates that the respondent has a coresi-
dent child and 0 indicates that the respondent
does not have any coresident child. Attendance at
religious services at Wave 2 assesses how often
the respondent usually attends religious services.
Responses ranged from 1 = never to 5 = more than
once a week, and a standardized measure of this
variable is used in the analysis. Functional difficulty
at Wave 2 (a = .77) is a four-item scale indicating
how much difficulty the respondent has (a) bath-
ing by oneself, (b) climbing a few flights of stairs, (c)
walking several blocks, and (d) doing heavy house-
work. Response categories are a little, some, a lot,
and cannot do. The scale is standardized, and higher
scores indicate higher levels of functional difficulty.
Control Variables.--Additionally, the analyses
controlled for two demographic variables--race
(1 = White and 0 = Black) and education (in years)--
that have been found to be related to positive and
negative support (Lincoln, Chatters, & Taylor,
2003; Lincoln, Taylor, & Chatters, 2003). Respon-
dent's age, gender, and number of children are con-
sidered in the preliminary analyses but are dropped
in the final models because they were not signifi-
cantly associated with the outcomes and also did
not influence the association between support from
children and psychological well-being. Descriptive
statistics for these variables are provided in Table
1. Finally, the duration (in months) between the
baseline and follow-up interviews is controlled.
Analytic Plan
First, descriptive statistics of the variables will
be presented. Next, ordinary least squares (OLS)
regression models are used to examine the concur-
rent and lagged effects of positive and negative
support on depressive and grief symptoms assessed
18 months after spousal loss. Finally, OLS regres-
sion models are used to examine the effects of
changes in positive and negative support.
Results
Sample Characteristics
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics of the ana-
lytic sample. Means and standard deviations of the
measures included in the analyses and of addition-
al demographic variables are presented. The mean
level of depressive symptoms increases at Wave 1
(6-month follow-up) and then decreases at Wave 2
(18-month follow-up), suggesting that on average,
widowed persons experienced more depressive
symptoms 6 months following widowhood but
this elevated level of depressive symptoms subsides
over time. A decrease in the mean CES-D score
from Wave 1 to Wave 2 could reflect either recov-
ery or selective attrition. Widowed persons may
experience fewer depressive symptoms at Wave 2
because they recovered from intense grief; however,
it is also possible that those who remain severely
depressed at the Wave 2 interviews are more likely
to drop out of the sample, thus lowering the average
CES-D score. Anxiety and anger remained at simi-
lar levels at Wave 1 and Wave 2. Measures of anx-
iety and anger were not assessed at baseline (prior
to loss) and thus are not presented in the table.
On average, levels of positive support in-
creased from baseline to Wave 1, whereas levels
of negative support decreased from baseline to
Wave 1. In terms of demographic characteristics,
The Gerontologist

the sample consists of predominantly White women,
with women comprising 71% and White subjects
comprising 88% of the sample. The average age
of respondents at Wave 2 was about 73 years.
Other characteristics of the sample are also de-
scribed in the table.

Effect of Positive and Negative Support From
Children on Widowed Older Adults' Psychologi-

and negative support from children both prior to
and after spousal loss relate to depressive symp-
toms, anxiety, and anger at Wave 2, controlling
for outcome measures at Wave 1. Effects of sup-
port at each wave were examined separately
because of high correlations among support
measures over time (correlations matrix of the
support measures and models with support from
all waves entered together are available from the
author).
First, looking at the effects of positive and nega-
tive support from children on depressive symptoms,
we see that support prior to loss does not have a sig-
nificant influence on the outcome (Model 1). How-
ever, positive support 6 months after widowhood
(Model 2) and negative support 18 months after
widowhood (Model 3) were significantly associated
with depressive symptoms at Wave 2. Specifically,
those who reported higher levels of positive support
from children at Wave 1 showed fewer depressive
symptoms at Wave 2 (b = -.16, p = .023), and
those who experienced higher levels of negative
support from children at Wave 2 showed greater
depressive symptoms at Wave 2 (b = .22, p < .001).
In terms of grief-related anxiety symptoms,
higher levels of negative support at all waves were
associated with higher levels of anxiety at Wave 2.
However, positive support did not exert any
significant influence. In terms of anger, those who
reported higher levels of negative support from

children 6 months after spousal loss experienced
greater anger at Wave 2 (b = .1, p = .046).
Previous level of psychological well-being had
a strong and significant influence on the Wave
2 outcomes. Among control variables, higher
education predicted fewer depressive symptoms,
whereas more functional limitations predicted
higher levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety.
Having a coresident child and the experience of
sudden death were associated with greater anger,
whereas frequent attendance at religious services
was associated with lower levels of anger.
Effect of Changes in Positive and Negative
Support on Psychological Well-Being
Table 4 shows the extent to which changes in
positive and negative support from pre-widowhood
to 6 months after widowhood influence psycho-
logical well-being at Wave 2, controlling for the
outcome at Wave 1. The results show that com-
pared with those who did not experience any
change in positive support, those who experienced
a decrease in positive support show higher levels of
depressive symptoms (b = .48, p = .013). Changes
in negative support did not have any significant
influence on depressive symptoms. Anxiety was
not significantly influenced by changes in either
positive or negative support. In terms of anger,
those who experienced an increase in negative
support showed higher levels of anger (b = .33,
p = .008). The effects of control variables were sim-
ilar to the results shown in Table 3.
Because including both the baseline and the
change measure of support can create a multicol-
linearity problem, in a supplementary analysis, I
also examined models without the baseline mea-
sure of support as a control variable. Omitting the
baseline measure, however, did not significantly
change the result and the effects of changes in pos-
itive and negative support in these models were
similar to the ones reported earlier (results are not
shown but available from the author).
Discussion
Summary of Findings
This study extends our understanding of the
relationship between different aspects of social
support and widowed older adults' psychological
Vol. 50, No. 4, 2010 479
adjustment in three ways. First, the findings from
the current study provided partial support for the
proposed hypotheses that there will be a significant
association between positive and negative support
and psychological outcomes and that negative
support will have a more potent effect than posi-
tive support. The relative impact of positive and
negative support differed depending on the out-
comes, but in general, negative support appeared
to have a greater impact than positive support.
Specifically, higher levels of children's positive
support at Wave 1 were associated with fewer
depressive symptoms at Wave 2; otherwise, the ef-
fects of positive support on psychological outcomes
were minimal. On the other hand, the effects of
negative support were notable across different
outcomes, although the significance of these ef-
fects depended on the timing of negative support.
In the case of anxiety, negative support at all waves
was significantly associated with higher levels of
anxiety.
In interpreting these findings, however, we
should be cautious about the possibility of a Type
II error. That is, given the small sample size of this
study, the lack of significant association between
positive support and grief symptoms may be due
to the lack of power or a measurement error. Fu-
ture studies should build upon this study and ex-
amine more thoroughly how different aspects of
social support (e.g., positive and negative support)
affect grief-related psychological functioning and
investigate the mechanisms by which social sup-
port affects older adults' psychological adjustment
upon spousal loss using a bigger sample. Further-
more, future research should explore under what
circumstances or contexts negative support is most
likely to result in detrimental psychological conse-
quences among widowed older adults.
Second, with regard to the concurrent and long-
term effects of social support, the findings suggest
that the timing of support may be an important
determinant of the effectiveness of support. On the
one hand, except in the case of anxiety, neither
positive nor negative support prior to widowhood
had a significant impact on widowed persons' psy-
chological well-being. On the other hand, support
assessed after widowhood--either Wave 1 or 2--
was significantly associated with psychological
distress. There may be several ways to interpret
these findings. One possibility is that support pro-
vided when parents are in need or under stress--
that is, after widowhood--may be more critical
than previously available support. Another possi-
bility is that psychological outcomes are more
susceptible to concurrent than to lagged support
or negative exchanges, especially in the case of
depressive symptoms. The small sample size may
be also contributing to the lack of significant as-
sociation between pre-loss support and psycho-
logical adjustment. Although with the available
data it is difficult to pinpoint the exact driving
force, this finding encourages researchers to more
thoroughly examine how the appropriate timing
of support may play a role in helping bereaved
older adults.
A final contribution of this study is that it con-
sidered the changing nature of social support, an
aspect of support that has been relatively over-
looked. Although only a few effects were signifi-
cant, the findings suggest that changes in support
from pre- to post-loss may have an important in-
fluence on widowed persons' psychological adap-
tation. In particular, a decrease in positive support
was associated with greater depressive symptoms
and an increase in negative support was associated
with greater anger. These findings suggest that re-
searchers and practitioners should not only attend
to the stress-buffering effect of preexisting support
but also consider how different responses of close
social relationships in the event of crisis affect old-
er adults' well-being. Adult children, in particular,
are expected to provide support when their aging
parents are in need (Hogan & Eggebeen, 1995).
When children do not meet this expectation of in-
creased positive support, parents may show more
depressive symptoms. Likewise, surviving spouses
may experience greater anger when they feel that
their children are critical or demanding while they
are going through a stressful life transition into
widowhood.
Limitations
This study has a number of limitations. First, as
addressed in other studies (e.g., Okun & Keith,
1998), this study bears the problem of low reliabil-
ity and low variability in social support measures,
especially in assessing the degree of negative sup-
port. As noted previously, in order to address the
problem of low reliability in the negative support
scale, I conducted an individual component analy-
sis examining the separate effects of children's
demands and criticism on outcomes (data are not
shown). The analyses revealed that anxiety is re-
lated to children's demands rather than to criti-
cism, whereas depressive symptoms and anger are
The Gerontologist

related more closely to children's criticism than to
demands.
Another limitation in the measures of positive
and negative support is that the items used to as-
sess these constructs may not have equal intensity
(Rook, 1997). Newsom and colleagues (2003) ad-
dress this issue by using comparably structured
questions to assess positive and negative social in-
teractions (e.g., "In the past month, how often did
the people in your life do things that made your
life easier" vs. "In the past month, how often did
the people in your life do things that made your
life harder"). Efforts such as these will help us bet-
ter understand the relative effects of positive and
negative support in future work.
Finally, the measures of social support grouped
all children together, although there may be vast
differences in the quality of relationships with re-
spect to individual children. Future studies should
examine how different characteristics of children
(e.g., child's gender, geographic proximity) add to
within-family variability in the ways that intergen-
erational relationships affect older adults' adapta-
tion to widowhood.
Because of the small sample size, the current
study was also not able to explore diversity within
the widowed population. Levels of positive and
negative support may have different implications
for different subgroups of the population. For ex-
ample, given that men experience greater difficulty
than women in terms of keeping ties with family
following spousal loss (Campbell & Silverman,
1996), high levels of positive support may yield
greater benefits for widowers than for widows. Fu-
ture studies should further explore these questions
building on the current research findings.
Implications for Practice
The findings have important implications for
practice in developing various intervention strate-
gies to help bereaved older adults and their fami-
lies. First, the findings highlight the importance of
considering both the positive and the negative as-
pects of social relationships when helping older
adults cope with spousal loss. Because the health-
promoting effect of social support is well estab-
lished (House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988) and
appeals intuitively, interventions have often over-
looked the potential negative consequences of so-
cial relationships. However, the literature suggests
that there are stressful aspects of social support
(Carstensen & Fremouw, 1988; Rook, 1990) espe-
cially in close relationships, such as the parent­
child relationship, and that even positive support,
when it is excessive, can lead to negative psycho-
logical consequences (Silverstein, Chen, & Heller,
1996). Previous studies have also suggested that in-
teractions with children can lead to negative reac-
tions on the part of widowed older adults, such as
fears about bothering or burdening them, and of
increased emotional dependence on their children
(Talbott, 1990). Practitioners can help bereaved
older adults evaluate the helpful and nonhelpful
aspects of intergenerational relationships and
empower them to think about ways to improve
the quality of the relationship by asking what
kind of help is most useful or not useful and what
changes in intergenerational relationships would
benefit them. In particular, practitioners can help
older adults identify potential sources of conflict
or tension in intergenerational relationships
by discussing different expectations and social
norms that widowed persons and their children
hold.
The findings also underscore the importance of
assessing and evaluating the impact of changing
relationships over time. As bereaved older adults
move from early stages of acute grief to long-term
adjustment, practitioners should reevaluate the
availability of their widowed clients' social sup-
port as well as their changing needs. Attending to
whether there have been any significant changes in
intergenerational relationships and discussing with
clients ways to maintain, reshape, or foster healthy
relationships can benefit bereaved persons' psy-
chological adjustment.
In conclusion, the current study adds important
information to our understanding of the relation-
ship between social support and adjustment to
widowhood by exploring both the concurrent and
the long-term influences of positive and negative
support from children on various psychological
outcomes and by investigating the effects of chang-
es in support. The findings underscore the impor-
tance of considering both positive and negative
aspects of social support as well as the changing
nature of social support in working with bereaved
older adults. By maintaining contact with wid-
owed individuals over the course of bereavement,
and by assessing their available support as well as
the areas that they need to make changes in social
relationships to better meet their needs, practitio-
ners can maximize the benefits of social support
and minimize the potentially harmful aspects of
social relationships.
