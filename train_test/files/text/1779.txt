Abstract
Objective: The objective of the present study was to assess whether weight status,
nutrient intake and dietary adequacy were associated with breakfast consumption
patterns.
Design: A representative sample of the US population was used in a secondary
analysis of nutrient intake/diet quality and weight status by breakfast consump-
tion patterns.
Setting: The 1999­2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES).
Subjects: The study sample included African-American (AA) children aged 1­12
years (n 1389).
Results: Forty-five per cent of children aged 1­5 years and 38 % of those aged 6­12
years consumed ready-to-eat cereal (RTEC) at breakfast; while 7?4 % and 16?9 % in
those age groups skipped breakfast, respectively. The lowest mean BMI (P # 0?05)
and mean waist circumference (P # 0?05) was found in children 1­12 years of age
who consumed RTEC at breakfast compared with other consumption groups. RTEC
breakfast consumers had the highest mean intakes of vitamins A, B6
and B12
,
thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, folate, Ca, Fe and Zn (P # 0?05) and the highest Mean
Adequacy Ratio (P # 0?05). RTEC breakfast consumers also had the highest intake
of carbohydrates and total sugars, and the lowest intakes of total fat (P # 0?05).
Conclusions: Consuming RTEC at breakfast was associated with improved weight
and nutrient adequacy in AA children. AA children in all breakfast categories still
had mean intakes of most nutrients below recommended levels. The implications
are that consuming a breakfast meal should be encouraged in these children, and
that RTEC at breakfast provides important nutrients and may help promote a
healthy weight.

Weight
The prevalence of overweight in children has increased
markedly over the past several decades, with African-
American (AA) children having a higher percentage of
overweight or at risk for overweight than their European-
American (EA) counterparts(1­4). Over the 30-year period
from 1971­1974 to 1999­2002, the prevalence of over-
weight increased approximately threefold (4 % to 13 %)
among 6­11-year-old EA children but fivefold (4 % to
20 %) among AA children(2). The prevalence of over-
weight in AA boys aged 6­11 years increased from 12?3 %
in 1988­1994 to 17?0 % in 1999­2002, while the pre-
valence of overweight in AA girls increased from 17?0 %
to 22?8 % in this age group(5).
Overweight and obesity in childhood is associated with
elevated blood pressure(6), dyslipidaemia(7), metabolic
syndrome(8), type 2 diabetes mellitus(9) and reduced
insulin sensitivity(10). Overweight in childhood is also
predictive of obesity in early adulthood, and the relative
risk of becoming an obese adult is significantly greater for
overweight children compared with normal-weight chil-
dren(11). A longitudinal analysis showed that 84 % of
overweight AA girls and 82 % of AA boys aged 5­14 years
will be obese in early adulthood, compared with 65 %
and 71 % of EA girls and boys, respectively(3). Secular
increases in childhood overweight are predicted to
increase the burden of adult disease(2).
In addition to disparities in the prevalence of over-
weight, AA and EA children have dissimilar nutrient
intakes(12,13). AA males 1­10 years of age are more likely
than EA males of the same age to have intakes of vitamin E,

Ca and Zn two-thirds or less than the Recommended
Dietary Allowance (RDA)(14), while AA girls are at risk for
inadequate intakes of vitamins A and E, Ca, Fe and Zn(14).
Vitamin E, Ca, Mg, K and fibre have been identified as
shortfall nutrients for all children by the 2005 Dietary
Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC)(15).
Breakfast has been described as the most important
meal of the day(16­20). Compared with children who con-
sumed breakfast regularly, those who skipped breakfast
were more likely to have an inadequate diet, with poorer
nutrient intakes, and a decreased likelihood of eating
lunch or dinner on a regular basis(16,21). Skipping breakfast
was associated with lower energy intakes, but higher
BMI(19,22,23). Skipping breakfast was also associated with
infrequent exercise(24), suggesting that those who skipped
breakfast had a less healthy lifestyle than those who did
not. Compared with breakfast skippers, children who ate
breakfast also had improved behaviour and school per-
formance(17,25). Although research has consistently shown
that breakfast consumption improved diet quality and
adequacy, it was the most commonly skipped meal(25,26).
In the USA, 92 % of ready-to-eat cereals (RTEC) are
fortified with essential micronutrients(27) and these may
be an excellent food source to help children meet their
nutrient recommendations. Consuming RTEC at breakfast
has been associated with higher intakes of Fe, folate,
vitamin C and Zn, and with lower intakes of total fat
and cholesterol(16,28­30). Increased intakes of milk and Ca
have also been observed in children who eat RTEC for
breakfast(31). Additionally, breakfasts that include RTEC
have been associated with lower BMI(29,30). Thus, RTEC
breakfast may play a role in maintaining a healthy weight
status and adequate nutrient intake in children(29,30).
The impact of breakfast consumption patterns on
weight and dietary adequacy in AA children has been
understudied. The aims of the present study were to
determine the association between weight status, nutrient
intake and dietary adequacy in AA children who skip
breakfast, consume a breakfast that includes RTEC or
consume a breakfast without RTEC.
Subjects and methods
Data collection
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) is a continuous programme that collects
information about the nutrition and health status of the US
population using a complex, multi-stage, probability sam-
pling design. In the 1999­2002 cohort, each participant
represented approximately 50 000 non-institutionalized
civilian Americans(32). Trained examiners completed
an in-person interview and a physical examination of
participants. The physical examination protocols used to
obtain anthropometric measures are described in detail
in the NHANES protocol manual(33).
A single, multiple-pass, 24 h dietary recall was con-
ducted during the interview using computer-assisted
software to record dietary intake data from partici-
pants(34). Detailed descriptions of the dietary interview
methods are provided in the NHANES dietary inter-
viewer's training manual, which includes pictures of the
Computer-Assisted Dietary Interview system (CADI)
screens, measurement guides, and charts used to collect
dietary information(35). Parents or caregivers reported
dietary intakes for children less than 6 years of age, while
subjects aged 6­11 years were assisted by an adult. The
name of the meal occasion, e.g. breakfast, brunch, lunch,
dinner/supper, drink/snack, was self-reported as such.
Subjects and breakfast categories
The NHANES data collected from 1999 to 2002 were used
in a secondary analysis to compare weight measures
and nutrient adequacy in AA children aged 1­12 years.
Classification of race was self-reported and based on US
census categories(36). Children were categorized into one
of three breakfast consumption groups: (i) breakfast
skippers (those who did not eat breakfast or brunch);
(ii) RTEC breakfast consumers (regardless of what else
was consumed at the breakfast/brunch meal); and (iii) other
breakfast consumers (no RTEC was consumed at the
breakfast/brunch meal). Due to the nature of the analysis
(secondary data analysis) and the lack of personal iden-
tifiers, the present study was exempted by the Institu-
tional Review Boards of the Louisiana State University
AgCenter and the Baylor College of Medicine.
Nutrient analysis
Nutrient analysis was accomplished using databases from
the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural
Research Service (Beltsville, MD, USA). The USDA Food
and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) ver-
sion 1 was used in NHANES 2001­2002, while the USDA
1994­98 Survey Nutrient Database was used to process
the dietary interview data in NHANES 1999­2000. In the
original release of NHANES 1999­2000, data on vitamin A
intake were available only in mg retinol equivalents,
vitamin E intake data were available only in mg a-toco-
pherol equivalents, only total folate (mg) intake data and
no vitamin K (mg) or sugars (g) intake data were avail-
able. Currently, Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin A,
vitamin E and folate are expressed as mg retinol activity
equivalents (mg RAE), mg a-tocopherol (mg AT) and
dietary folate equivalents (DFE), respectively(37,38). We
used the special database released by the USDA to
determine vitamin A as mg RAE and vitamin E as mg AT
(USDA Database of Vitamin A (mcg RAE) and Vitamin E
(mg AT) for National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey 1999­2000). The FNDDS was used to append the
intakes of folate (DFE), vitamin K (mg) and total sugars
(g) to the NHANES 1999­2000 database. Added sugars
food composition data were obtained from the Pyramid

2?0. Added sugars were defined by the USDA as white
sugar, brown sugar, raw sugar, corn syrup, corn syrup
solids, high-fructose corn syrup, malt syrup, maple syrup,
pancake syrup, fructose sweetener, liquid fructose,
honey, molasses, anhydrous dextrose, crystal dextrose
and dextrin that are eaten separately or used as an
ingredient in processed or prepared foods.
In order to rule out the possibility that the nutrient
contribution of eating RTEC for breakfast was attributable
to milk added to the cereal, the daily nutrient intake
of breakfast consumption groups was compared after
deleting the nutrient intake from milk combined with
RTEC consumed at breakfast. Daily nutrient intake from
all foods except milk combined with RTEC consumed at
breakfast was determined by summing the nutrient intake
from all foods reported in the 24 h recall after excluding
any fluid milk other than soya milk combined with RTEC
eaten at breakfast.
The Mean Adequacy Ratio (MAR) was calculated by
expressing micronutrient intake as a percentage of the
Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), truncated to no
more than 100 %, and averaged over thirteen micro-
nutrients: vitamins A, E, C, B1
, B2
, B6
and B12
, niacin,
folate, P, Mg, Fe and Zn(39,40). A score of 90 and above
was considered nutritionally adequate for MAR(39).
Statistical analyses
Sample-weighted data were used in all statistical analyses,
and all analyses were performed using the SUDAAN soft-
ware package release 9?0?1 (Research Triangle Institute,
Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) to adjust the variance
for the complex sample design. The sample-weighted
percentages (and standard error of the percentages) of
children in breakfast consumption groups were calcu-
lated using PROC CROSSTAB of SUDAAN. Unadjusted
means and SE for total energy were also calculated
using PROC DESCRIP of SUDAAN. Least-square means
and SE were calculated using PROC REGRESS of SUDAAN.
The energy-adjusted prevalence of overweight was
determined by calculating the least-square mean of a
dichotomous variable using PROC REGRESS of SUDAAN.
Children with BMI $ 95th percentile of BMI-for-age on
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Growth Charts were classified as overweight. Percentiles
and Z scores of BMI-for-age and weight-for-age were
calculated using the SAS [Statistical Analysis Software]
Program for CDC Growth Charts (US Department of
Health and Human Services, Hyattsville, MD, USA).
Sample-weighted LSMEANS and SE were estimated for
micro- and macronutrients consumed. In comparing
the three breakfast consumption groups, covariates were
energy (kJ/kcal), gender and age (years); covariates were
not used for MAR calculations. The unadjusted means for
total energy and adjusted means of breakfast consump-
tion groups were compared using the Bonferroni method
to adjust the significance level for multiple comparisons.
Because there were three comparisons, i.e. breakfast
skippers v. RTEC breakfast consumers, breakfast skippers
v. other breakfast consumers, RTEC breakfast consumers
v. other breakfast consumers, the a value of P # 0?05
was divided by 3, and the means of the groups were
significantly different only if the P value of the contrast
was ,0?01667. Guidelines for statistical procedures for
analysis of NHANES data are available online(41).
Results
Percentage of African-American children in
breakfast consumption groups by age and gender
The percentages of AA male and female children who
were assigned to each breakfast consumption category
are shown in Table 1. There were 7?4 % of 1­5-year-old
children and 16?9 % of 6­12-year-old children who skip-
ped breakfast. The percentage of children aged 1­5 years
who consumed RTEC at breakfast was 45?0 %, compared
with 38?0 % of children aged 6­12 years. There were
47?6 % of children 1­5 years of age and 45?2 % of children
6­12 years of age who consumed other breakfasts.
Mean weight measures
AA children who consumed RTEC for breakfast had lower
mean BMI (P # 0?05) and waist circumference (P # 0?05)
than those who either skipped breakfast or consumed
other types of breakfast (Table 2). There was a lower
percentage of overweight children in the RTEC breakfast
consumption group (13?1 %) compared with breakfast
skippers (26?1 %), but there were no differences in the
prevalence of overweight between the RTEC breakfast

and the other breakfast consumption group. No differ-
ences in percentiles or Z scores of BMI-for-age or weight-
for-age were observed between breakfast consumption
groups in children.
Mean daily energy and micronutrient intakes
Table 3 shows mean daily energy and micronutrient
intakes by breakfast consumption group for children 1­12
years of age. Breakfast skippers had lower mean energy
intakes than children who consumed RTEC or other
breakfasts; energy intakes of children in the other two
groups did not differ significantly. Compared with those
who either skipped breakfast or consumed other break-
fasts, children in the RTEC breakfast category had the
highest mean daily intakes of vitamins A and B12
, thiamin,
riboflavin, folate and Fe (P # 0?05 for all). No differences
were found in mean daily intakes of vitamin B6
, niacin, Ca
and Zn between breakfast skippers and other breakfast
consumers; however, RTEC breakfast consumers had
higher intakes of these nutrients (P # 0?05) than the two
other groups. RTEC breakfast consumers had a lower
intake of vitamin E than breakfast skippers (P # 0.05).
Comparisons of micronutrient intakes among breakfast
consumption groups without milk on RTEC showed that
Ca, P and K in RTEC breakfast consumers were lower
than other breakfast consumers, but not significantly
different from breakfast skippers (data not shown). AA
children aged 1­12 years who ate RTEC at breakfast had a
higher percentage MAR than breakfast skippers or those
consuming other breakfasts (P # 0?05).
Protein, carbohydrate, fat, cholesterol and
fibre intakes
Children who consumed RTEC for breakfast had the
highest intakes from carbohydrate and total sugars and the
lowest intake from total fat when compared with either
breakfast skippers or other breakfast consumers (P #0?05)
(Table 4). RTEC breakfast consumers had lower SFA intake
than breakfast skippers and lower cholesterol intake than
other breakfast consumers (P# 0?05). Breakfast skippers
and other breakfast consumers had higher intakes of MUFA
and PUFA than RTEC breakfast consumers (P #0?05).
When RTEC consumption at breakfast without milk on
cereal was considered for children 1­12 years of age,
macronutrients followed the same patterns of association
with breakfast consumption groups, except mean SFA
intake was lowest in RTEC breakfast consumers compared
with both breakfast skippers and other breakfast con-
sumers (data not shown). No differences were seen in total
dietary fibre among breakfast consumption categories.

Discussion
Our data suggest that older children are more likely to
skip breakfast. This finding is consistent with results from
other studies(30,42). Further research is needed to deter-
mine the reasons, but breakfast skipping may be partially
attributable to environmental or behavioural changes that
occur with increasing age, such as the changes in food
choices available at school or changes in behaviour that
are influenced by peers(26,42,43). Investigation into why
children aged 6­12 years skip breakfast more than those
aged 1­5 years may help to identify correlates that can be
then used to implement appropriate interventions.
The lower mean BMI and waist circumference observed
in AA children who ate RTEC for breakfast suggests that
consumption of RTEC at breakfast may contribute to a
healthier weight status. Despite having higher weight
measures, breakfast skippers had a lower energy intake
than RTEC and other breakfast consumers. This finding
also confirms other research(24,44). The lower mean BMI
and waist circumference suggest that children who con-
sume breakfast may have healthier lifestyles than those
who skip breakfast. Under-reporting of energy intake may
also have occurred in these children, since the BMI of the
parent or child may affect reporting in a 24 h recall(45).
Children 1­12 years of age who skipped breakfast
also had significantly lower intakes of most of the
micronutrients compared with RTEC breakfast consumers
or other breakfast consumers. Although there is a lack of
published research on the relationship of weight and diet
adequacy to breakfast and RTEC breakfast consumption
in AA children, comparisons of our results with those
conducted with other age and ethnic groups reveal
similar findings(28,29,44,46). In a representative sample of
4­12-year-old children, Albertson et al. found that the
frequency of RTEC consumption over a 2-week period
was positively correlated with micronutrient intake(29).
van den Boom et al. concluded that frequency of RTEC
consumption was positively related to improved nutri-
tional profiles in Spanish children(44). Further, a repre-
sentative sample of British children aged 4­18 years
found that intakes of Fe and vitamins B and D were
positively associated with daily percentage of energy
obtained from RTEC(46). The increased nutrient intake
associated with RTEC consumption may be due to for-
tification of RTEC or milk that is commonly consumed
with RTEC, if children who did not consume these foods
did not obtain these nutrients from other foods consumed
during the day. The Bogalusa Heart Study showed that
children who skipped breakfast did not make up the
differences in dietary intakes at other meals(28). Similarly,
a study of AA children found that skipping breakfast
resulted in substantial deficits in dietary intakes of nutri-
ents(16); more than a third of breakfast skippers consumed

less than 50 % of the RDA for vitamins A, E, B6
and folate,
and nearly a quarter consumed less than 50 % of the RDA
for energy, vitamin C, Ca and Fe(16).
Mean Ca intake was higher for RTEC breakfast con-
sumers than for breakfast skippers and other breakfast
consumers. Consumption of milk, which is high in Ca and
K and is commonly consumed with cereal, may explain
this finding as it is consistent with other research(31). Ca
and K were identified by the 2005 DGAC as two of the
shortfall nutrients in the diets of children 9 years of age or
older(15). AA males aged 1­10 years were more likely than
same-age EA males to have Ca intakes two-thirds or less
than the RDA(14), while AA girls were at risk for inade-
quate intake of Ca(14). Consumption of milk with RTEC
could improve Ca intake in this group.
Although our study did not show differences in fibre
intake among breakfast consumption groups, others have
shown RTEC as a significant source of fibre for chil-
dren(30,47,48). Children in our study may have consumed
low-fibre cereals, which would suggest the need to pro-
mote increased intake of RTEC with higher fibre content
or the need to supplement RTEC with additional fibre(47).
The present study had several limitations. NHANES is a
cross-sectional study and causal inferences cannot be
drawn. Dietary intakes were self-reported and relied on
memory of the participants or their parent or guardian;
therefore data were subject to non-sampling errors, such
as under-reporting of energy and examiner effects(36).
Parents or guardians who reported or assisted children
with the recalls may not know all foods that children in
day care or school consumed the previous day. Further,
24 h dietary recalls may not accurately reflect the usual
dietary patterns of participants(49,50); however, the col-
lection of group data from 24 h recalls with mean
reporting, as used by the NHANES, is an appropriate use
of 24 h diet recalls(51). Children's self-reported portion
size estimates are appropriate for ranking children's
relative intakes, but may result in sizeable errors in
quantitative estimates of food and energy intakes(52).
Another limitation was that physical activity, an
important contributor to weight status(53), was not used as
a covariate since physical activity information was not
collected using a standardized method across the age
groups. Further, RTEC were grouped together and
although the majority were fortified, those consumed may
have varied considerably in energy, carbohydrate, fibre,
total and added sugar content(27); whether RTEC were
pre-sweetened was also not considered in our study. It
was also not considered that RTEC consumed at other
meals may make an additional positive contribution to
nutrient intake and weight of all the breakfast consump-
tion groups. Finally, foods other than RTEC and milk that
were consumed by individuals in the RTEC breakfast
group may have influenced nutrient intake. A study to
determine the effects of other foods consumed with RTEC
is necessary to determine contributions to nutrient intake.
Conclusion and implications
In the present study, improved weight measures and
nutrient adequacy were associated with eating RTEC for

suming a breakfast meal should be encouraged in these
children, and that RTEC at breakfast provides important
nutrients and may help promote a healthy weight.
