Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the effect of pectoralis major myocutaneous (PMM) flap reconstruction on
upper extremity dysfunction.
Methods: Patients undergoing PMM flap reconstruction following head and neck cancer resection
were enrolled. The control group comprised age-, sex- and clinical characteristic-matched patients
undergoing non-PMM flap reconstruction. All patients completed the Disability of the Arm,
Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire preoperatively and >1 year postoperatively.
Results: There was no significant difference between pre- and postoperative DASH scores in the
control group (n ¼ 46; 2.38 Æ 3.33 and 2.99 Æ 4.21, respectively). In the PMM flap group (n ¼ 46),
the postoperative DASH score was significantly higher than the preoperative score (7.00 Æ 9.13
and 2.44 Æ 3.50, respectively). In the PMM flap group, flap size was significantly associated with
postoperative DASH score.
Conclusion: PMM flap reconstruction has a small but significant negative effect on upper
extremity dysfunction.

Introduction
The pectoralis major myocutaneous (PMM)
flap has been a popular procedure for head
and neck reconstructive surgery since its
introduction in the 1970s.1­3 This procedure
covers an extensive area, can be performed
in patients in generally poor health, and
requires no microvascular anastomosis.4,5

postoperative shoulder dysfunction, but
there are conflicting data regarding the
effect of PMM flap harvesting. Studies
have variously indicated that any loss in
shoulder function is well tolerated,6 while
others have presented patients who were
unable to return to normal function after
PMM flap surgery.7 The aim of the present
study was to investigate the effect of PMM
flap surgery on upper extremity function.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study recruited consecutive patients
who underwent PMM flap reconstruction
following head and neck cancer excision at
the First Affiliated Hospital of China
Medical University, Shenyang, China,
between January 2007 and December 2012.
The control group comprised patients who
received a non-PMM flap reconstruction
following head and neck cancer excision.
Control patients were matched to PMM
patients by sex, age (!5 years), tumour stage
(according to the International Union
Against Cancer 2002 classification8), pri-
mary tumour site and type of neck dissection
(selective vs modified radical). In all neck
dissections, the spine accessory nerve was
preserved and levels I, II and III were
dissected.
The China Medical University institu-
tional research committee approved the
study. All participants provided written
informed consent prior to enrolment.
DASH questionnaire
All patients completed the Disability of the
Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) ques-
tionnaire9 preoperatively and at >1 year
postoperatively. This questionnaire evalu-
ates symptoms and the ability to perform
everyday activities, and reflects upper-extre-
mity function regardless of which hand/arm
is used. DASH comprises two components:
disability/symptom questions (30 items,
each scored 1­5); and optional high per-
formance sport/music or work questions
(four items, each scored 1­5). The final
score ranges between 0 and 100, with
higher scores indicating more severe
disability.
Statistical analyses
Due to previous conflicting data it was not
possible to calculate the actual incidence of
postoperative complications and the
required least sample size. However, taking
the study's prospective design into consid-
eration, it was determined that a sample size
consistent with that used in earlier studies
would be reasonable.6,7,10­18
Data were presented as mean Æ SD
(range) or n (%) and compared using the
paired t-test. Pearson's and Spearman's
correlation coefficients were used to deter-
mine associations between clinical and
demographic factors, and postoperative
DASH score. All statistical analyses were
performed using SPSSÕ version 13.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for WindowsÕ.
P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
A total of 59 consecutive patients who
underwent PMM flap reconstruction com-
pleted the preoperative DASH question-
naire, but 13 died in the first postoperative
year. The study therefore included 46
patients (46 male/0 female; mean age
56.8 Æ 10.8 years; age range 44­78 years).
Of these, seven tumours were classified as
stage T3, and the remaining 39 were stage
T4. Mean PMM flap size was 66.5 Æ 20.3
cm2 (range 50­120 cm2). Partial necrosis
developed in six patients; there were no
cases of total necrosis. The control group
comprised 46 patients matched for age, sex
and clinical characteristics, who underwent

anterolateral thigh flap (n ¼ 33), submental
island flap (n ¼ 8), or platysma myocuta-
neous flap (n ¼ 5). Demographic and clinical
data for the study population are shown in
Table 1.
There was no significant difference
between pre- and postoperative DASH
scores in the control group. In the PMM
flap group, the postoperative DASH score
was significantly higher than the preopera-
tive score (P < 0.001; Table 1).
Correlation analyses revealed that flap
size was significantly associated with post-
operative DASH score in the PMM flap
group (r ¼ 0.901, P < 0.001). Preoperative
DASH score, age, sex, tumour site,
tumour stage, and the occurrence of
complications (flap necrosis) were not
significantly associated with postoperative
DASH score.
Discussion
The shoulder is an important component of
the upper extremity, and any factor that
negatively affects this joint may also have an
impact on upper extremity function. The
effect of neck dissection on shoulder func-
tion is well documented. Selective neck
dissection has a better outcome than radical
neck dissection, with the risk of injury
(including neural injury, local devasculari-
zation and decompression injury) to the
accessory nerve reduced if the level 5 nodes
are not included. Patients undergoing level
2­4 dissection have less shoulder dysfunc-
tion that those undergoing level 2­5 dissec-
tion,10 and those who undergo modified
radical neck dissection report more severe
disability (``shoulder syndrome'') than other
patients.11 Although the current study

found no significant increase in DASH score
in the control group, neck dissection can
inherently induce upper extremity dysfunc-
tion. It is therefore important that studies
are designed to exclude these effects of neck
dissection.
The few studies evaluating the associ-
ation between PMM flap reconstruction and
shoulder function did not take the effect of
neck dissection into account. A retrospective
study found that PMM flap reconstruction
resulted in minimal or low shoulder mor-
bidity.12 Another study compared both
shoulders in patients who underwent PMM
flap surgery, and found significantly reduced
flexion angle and strength, as well as higher
disability scores, in the donor shoulder
compared with the non-donor side.13
The effect of radiotherapy on upper
extremity function is unclear. Postoperative
radiotherapy in patients who undergo neck
dissection has been shown to result in a 20%
decrease in the range of shoulder motion
compared with patients who undergo neck
dissection but no radiotherapy.14 In add-
ition, a tendency towards reduced shoulder
function in patients undergoing postopera-
tive radiotherapy has been reported.15
However, others have found no apparent
negative effect of radiotherapy on shoulder
function.16,17 The current study did not
examine the effect of radiotherapy, and this
should be evaluated in future studies.
To our knowledge, the present study is
the first to evaluate the effect of PMM flap
reconstruction on upper extremity function
as determined by DASH score. The DASH
questionnaire is brief, self-administered and
multifactorial, and has sufficient detail to
identify subtle changes. It has high reliability
and credibility in assessing upper extremity
dysfunction.18,19 PMM flap reconstruction
resulted in significantly higher DASH scores
(i.e., more extensive upper extremity disabil-
ity) compared with preoperative values in
the present study. However, it should be
noted that all patients were evaluated !1
year after surgery, and early physical ther-
apy is known to improve the recovery of
shoulder function.20 Furthermore, the mean
postoperative DASH score after PMM flap
surgery was 7.0 (of a possible maximum of
100), indicating that any damage caused was
not severe.
There was a positive correlation between
flap size and DASH score in the present
study. This may be due to the greater extent
of muscle damage associated with a larger
flap, since the pectoralis major has an import-
ant role in rotation, flexion and adduction of
the shoulder. In a finding consistent with
others, there was no association between
postoperative DASH score and age.12
The present study had several limitations,
primarily the lack of randomization. In
addition, objective measurements would
allow evaluation of the mechanism by
which PMM flap reconstruction affects
upper extremity function.
In conclusion, after taking into account the
effect of neck dissection, PMM flap recon-
struction has a small but significant negative
effect on upper extremity dysfunction.
