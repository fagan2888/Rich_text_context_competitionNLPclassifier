Persistent Increase of Prevalence of
Metabolic Syndrome Among U.S. Adults:
NHANES III to NHANES 1999­2006
ARUPENDRA MOZUMDAR, PHD
GARY LIGUORI, PHD
OBJECTIVE -- To compare the prevalence in metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) between 1988­
1994 and 1999­2006 among U.S. adults of different races or ethnicities.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Analysis of data on 6,423 adult men and
nonpregnant women aged 20 years from Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) and 6,962 participants from the combined NHANES 1999­2006 were
done. The revised National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III definition
was used to calculate MetSyn.
RESULTS -- Both the unadjusted prevalence (27.9  1.1% to 34.1  0.8%, P  0.001) and
age-adjusted prevalence (29.2  1.0% to 34.2  0.7%, P  0.001) increased from NHANES III
to NHANES 1999­2006, respectively. Although MetSyn prevalence was highest in Mexican
Americans, significant increases in prevalence occurred among non-Hispanic whites and non-
Hispanic blacks, especially among younger women.
CONCLUSIONS -- The persistent increase of MetSyn among U.S. adults is a serious public
health concern because it raises the likelihood of increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes.
Diabetes Care 34:216­219, 2011
The metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) is
a constellation of metabolic abnor-
malities and is associated with in-
creased risk of developing diabetes (1),
cardiovascular disease (2), and higher
mortality from all causes (3). Among the
few studies using nationally representa-
tive samples on MetSyn (4­9), Ford et al.
(9) estimated an increasing trend of
MetSyn prevalence by comparing the
Third National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES III) and
NHANES 1999­2000 data. However, be-
cause of the smaller sample size of
NHANES 1999 ­2000, the change in
MetSyn prevalence for various subpopu-
lations, which is necessary to track age
and ethnicity specific trends, was not es-
timated. Therefore, the objective of this
study is to compare the prevalence of
MetSyn between NHANES III and
NHANES 1999­2006 among U.S. adults
of different races or ethnicities.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- We identified the cases
of MetSyn using the revised American
Heart Association/National Cholesterol
Education Program Adult Treatment
Panel III definition (10), including medi-
cation uses for appropriate MetSyn crite-
ria. Data for this study were obtained from
public-use datasets of the NHANES III,
NHANES 1988 ­1994 (data release
11#1A), and four continuous NHANES
data releases: 1999­2000, 2001­2002,
2003­2004, and 2005­2006. Details of
survey and laboratory procedure of
NHANES are published elsewhere (11­
13). Data from NHANES 1999­2006
were combined for this study to produce
estimates of MetSyn for demographic
subpopulations (e.g., sex-age-race/
ethnicity) with greater statistical reliabil-
ity. Because the data on fasting
triglycerides and fasting glucose were re-
quired to identify MetSyn and those mea-
surements were done on a subsample
population, the sample weights for the
subsample were used in this study.
The appropriate sample weights for
combined NHANES 1999­2006 were
constructed using National Center for
Health Statistics guidelines (14). To
maintain the consistency of blood pres-
sure data between the two surveys, the
procedure described by Ford et al. (9) was
followed.
The continuous NHANES measured
fasting glucose and serum triglycerides
from blood samples drawn in the morn-
ing; therefore, only participants who at-
tended a morning examination session for
NHANES III were included in this analy-
sis. Otherwise, the sample includes men
and nonpregnant women aged 20 years
who fasted for at least 8 h. The number of
participants in the final analysis was
6,423 for NHANES III and 6,962 for
NHANES 1999­2006. Statistical analyses
to calculate prevalence were performed
using the survey procedures in SAS soft-
ware version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC). The statistical significance of the
change in MetSyn prevalence between the
two surveys was examined by Student t
test, in which the square root of the sum
of the squared standard errors was uti-
lized to calculate the pooled standard er-
ror of the difference in the mean.
RESULTS -- The age-adjusted preva-
lence of four of the five metabolic abnor-
malities of MetSyn increased significantly
between the surveys for women: abdom-
inal obesity 46.0  1.4% to 58.0  1.1%,
P  0.001; hypertriglyceridemia 24.7 
1.2% to 27.6  0.8%, P  0.042; high
blood pressure (HBP) 27.8  0.9% to
36.6  0.8%, P  0.001; high fasting glu-
cose 24.2  1.2% to 29.2  1.0%, P 
0.002. However, for men, age-adjusted
prevalence significantly increased in ab-
dominal obesity (30.4  1.6% to 41.1 
1.1%, P  0.001) and HBP (32.0  0.8%
to 40.0  0.7%, P  0.001) only. The

age-adjusted prevalence of low HDL cho-
lesterol significantly decreased in both
sexes (men: 36.4  1.7% to 27.6  1.0%,
P  0.001; women: 39.6  1.4% to
33.8  1.1%, P  0.001) between the
surveys.
Both age-adjusted and age-specific
prevalence of MetSyn for NHANES
1999 ­2006 were significantly higher
than for NHANES III (Table 1). The un-
adjusted (P  0.012) and age-adjusted
(P  0.046) prevalence increased signifi-
cantly between the two surveys for men;
however, there was no significant change
in any of the three age-groups. For
women, both unadjusted and age-
adjusted (P  0.001) prevalence in-
creased significantly between the two
surveys, with a significant increase noted
in all three age-groups. Among non-
Hispanic White (NHW) subjects, both
men and women showed significant in-
creases in unadjusted (men: P  0.010;
women: P  0.001) and age-adjusted
(men: P  0.048; women: P  0.007)
prevalence of MetSyn. However, when
classified by age-groups, only women
aged 20­39 years showed significant in-
crease (P  0.010). Prevalence of MetSyn
did not change significantly among non-
Hispanic Black (NHB) men (P  0.050)
between the two surveys, but NHB
women aged 20­39 years showed a sig-
nificant increase in prevalence (P 
0.036). The age-adjusted prevalence of
MetSyn in NHANES 1999­2006 was
highest among Mexican Americans (men:
36.6  1.9%; women: 42.6  1.7%) with
little change in this group from NHANES
III. Using the unadjusted prevalence rates
from combined sample population of
NHANES 1999­2006, we estimated that
about 32.4 million men and 35.3 million
women in U.S. had MetSyn. Among U.S.
adults with MetSyn, 50.6 million were
NHW, 6.3 million were NHB, and 4.6
million were Mexican Americans.
The age-adjusted prevalence of U.S.
adults reporting diabetes (other than
pregnancy related) or having a fasting
blood glucose 126 mg/dl significantly
increased in both sexes (men: 8.1  0.6%
to 10.5  0.6%, P  0.005; women:
5.8  0.6% to 8.5  0.5%, P  0.001)
between the two surveys. The age-
adjusted prevalence of MetSyn among
U.S. men without diabetes did not change
significantly (27.6  1.4% to 30.6 
1.1%, P  0.08); however, the prevalence
significantly increased for women with-
out diabetes (24.0  1.2% to 29.4 
1.0%, P  0.001), including women aged
20­39 years (10.0  1.6% to 15.8 
1.2%, P  0.003) and aged 40­59 years
(25.8  2.4% to 31.6  1.7%, P 
0.049).
CONCLUSIONS -- Ford et al. (9) es-
timated that 50 million U.S. adults in
1990 and 64 million in 2000 had
MetSyn, representing a 28% increase in
prevalence. From the combined
NHANES 1999­2006 data, we estimated
68 million U.S. adults had MetSyn, or a
further increase of 6%. The prevalence of
MetSyn in U.S. adults in 1999­2006 was
34.1  0.8% (after age adjustment
34.2  0.7%), which is a significant in-
crease from 1988­1994, and more so in
women (28.4%) than in men (16.8%).
Further, in both NHW and NHB the prev-
alence of MetSyn significantly increased
in women, particularly younger women
(aged 20­39 years). The increased prev-
alence of MetSyn was primarily due to in-
creases in abdominal obesity and HBP.
An increase in MetSyn prevalence is
expected to be followed by an increase in
diabetes prevalence, though of a lesser
magnitude. Between the two surveys,
there was a 4.3% increase in age-adjusted
prevalence of MetSyn among adults with-
out diabetes and a 2.6% increase in dia-
betes. As we continue to see an increase in
MetSyn, especially in certain ethnic
groups and younger women, we will see a
concomitant increase in diabetes and its
comorbidities and associated medical
costs.
