OBJECTIVEdTo describe the prevalence of biochemical B12
deficiency in adults with type
2 diabetes taking metformin compared with those not taking metformin and those without
diabetes, and explore whether this relationship is modified by vitamin B12
supplements.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdAnalysis of data on U.S. adults $50 years of
age with (n = 1,621) or without type 2 diabetes (n = 6,867) from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1999­2006. Type 2 diabetes was defined as clinical
diagnosis after age 30 without initiation of insulin therapy within 1 year. Those with diabetes
were classified according to their current metformin use. Biochemical B12
deficiency was defined
as serum B12
concentrations #148 pmol/L and borderline deficiency was defined as .148 to
#221 pmol/L.
RESULTSdBiochemical B12
deficiency was present in 5.8% of those with diabetes using
metformin compared with 2.4% of those not using metformin (P = 0.0026) and 3.3% of those
without diabetes (P = 0.0002). Among those with diabetes, metformin use was associated with
biochemical B12
deficiency (adjusted odds ratio 2.92; 95% CI 1.26­6.78). Consumption of any
supplement containing B12
was not associated with a reduction in the prevalence of biochemical
B12
deficiency among those with diabetes, whereas consumption of any supplement containing
B12
was associated with a two-thirds reduction among those without diabetes.
CONCLUSIONSdMetformin therapy is associated with a higher prevalence of biochemical
B12
deficiency. The amount of B12
recommended by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (2.4 mg/day)
and the amount available in general multivitamins (6 mg) may not be enough to correct this
deficiency among those with diabetes.
Diabetes Care 35:327­333, 2012
It is well known that the risks of both
type 2 diabetes and B12
deficiency in-
crease with age (1,2). Recent national
data estimate a 21.2% prevalence of diag-
nosed diabetes among adults $65 years
of age and a 6 and 20% prevalence of bio-
chemical B12
deficiency (serum B12
,148
pmol/L) and borderline deficiency (serum
B12
$148­221 pmol/L) among adults
$60 years of age (3,4).
The diabetes drug metformin has been
reported to cause a decrease in serum B12
concentrations. In the first efficacy trial,
DeFronzo and Goodman (5) demonstrated
that although metformin offers superior
control of glycosylated hemoglobin levels
and fasting plasma glucose levels com-
pared with glyburide, serum B12
concen-
trations were lowered by 22% compared
with placebo, and 29% compared with
glyburide therapy after 29 weeks of treat-
ment. A recent, randomized control trial
designed to examine the temporal rela-
tionship between metformin and serum
B12
found a 19% reduction in serum B12
levels compared with placebo after 4 years
(6). Several other randomized control tri-
als and cross-sectional surveys reported
reductions in B12
ranging from 9 to 52%
(7­16). Although classical B12
deficiency
presents with clinical symptoms such as
anemia, peripheral neuropathy, depres-
sion, and cognitive impairment, these
symptoms are usually absent in those
with biochemical B12
deficiency (17).
Several researchers have made recom-
mendations to screen those with type 2
diabetes on metformin for serum B12
levels
(6,7,14­16,18­21). However, no formal
recommendations have been provided by
the medical community or the U.S. Preven-
tion Services Task Force. High-dose B12
in-
jection therapy has been successfully used
to correct the metformin-induced decline
in serum B12
(15,21,22). The use of B12
supplements among those with type 2
diabetes on metformin in a nationally
representative sample and their poten-
tially protective effect against biochemi-
cal B12
deficiency has not been reported.
It is therefore the aim of the current study
to use the nationally representative Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) population to deter-
mine the prevalence of biochemical B12
deficiency among those with type 2 diabe-
tes $50 years of age taking metformin
compared with those with type 2 diabetes
not taking metformin and those without
diabetes, and to explore how these rela-
tionships are modified by B12
supplement
consumption.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS
Design overview
NHANES is a nationally representative
sample of the noninstitutionalized U.S.
population with targeted oversampling
of U.S. adults $60 years of age, African
Americans, and Hispanics. Details of these
surveys have been described elsewhere
(23). All participants gave written in-
formed consent, and the survey protocol
was approved by a human subjects re-
view board.

Setting and participants
Our study included adults $50 years of
age from NHANES 1999­2006. Partici-
pants with positive HIV antibody test re-
sults, high creatinine levels (.1.7 mg/dL
for men and .1.5 mg/dL for women),
and prescription B12
injections were ex-
cluded from the analysis. Participants
who reported having prediabetes or bor-
derline diabetes (n = 226) were removed
because they could not be definitively
grouped as having or not having type 2
diabetes. We also excluded pregnant
women, those with type 1 diabetes, and
those without diabetes taking metformin.
Based on clinical aspects described by the
American Diabetes Association and previ-
ous work in NHANES, those who were
diagnosed before the age of 30 and began
insulin therapy within 1 year of diagnosis
were classified as having type 1 diabetes
(24,25). Type 2 diabetes status in adults
was dichotomized as yes/no. Participants
who reported receiving a physician's diag-
nosis after age 30 (excluding gestational
diabetes) and did not initiate insulin
therapy within 1 year of diagnosis were
classified as having type 2 diabetes.
Outcomes and follow-up
The primary outcome was biochemical B12
deficiencydeterminedbyserumB12
concen-
trations. Serum B12
levels were quantified
using the Quantaphase II folate/vitamin
B12
radioassay kit from Bio-Rad Laborato-
ries (Hercules, CA). We defined biochemi-
cal B12
deficiency as serum levels #148
pmol/L, borderline deficiency as serum
B12
.148 to #221 pmol/L, and normal
as .221 pmol/L (26).
The main exposure of interest was
metformin use. Using data collected in the
prescription medicine questionnaire,
those with type 2 diabetes were classified
as currently using metformin therapy
(alone or in combination therapy) ver-
sus those not currently using metformin.
Length of metformin therapy was used to
assess the relationship between duration
of metformin therapy and biochemical
B12
deficiency. In the final analysis, two
control groups were used to allow the
comparison of those with type 2 diabetes
taking metformin with those with type 2
diabetes not taking metformin and those
without diabetes.
To determine whether the association
between metformin and biochemical B12
deficiency is modified by supplemental
B12
intake, data from the dietary supple-
ment questionnaire were used. Informa-
tion regarding the dose and frequency
was used to calculate average daily sup-
plemental B12
intake. We categorized sup-
plemental B12
intake as 0 mg (no B12
containing supplement), .0­6 mg, .6­
25 mg, and .25 mg. The lower intake
group,.0­6 mg,includes6 mg,theamount
of vitamin B12
typically found in over-the-
counter multivitamins, and 2.4 mg, the
daily amount the IOM recommends for
all adults $50 years of age to consume
through supplements or fortified food (1).
The next group, .6­25 mg, includes 25 mg,
the amount available in many multivita-
mins marketed toward senior adults. The
highest group contains the amount found
in high-dose B-vitamin supplements.

Biochemical B12
deficiency and metformin therapy
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using
SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)
and SUDAAN version 10.1 (Research Tri-
angle Park, Durham, NC). Sample weights
and variances were applied throughout
the analysis to provide a representative
sample of the U.S. population $50 years
of age.
SAS survey procedures and SUDAAN
"proc descript" were used to estimate
means and proportions. SUDAAN "proc
crosstab" was used toestimatethe weighted
prevalence adjusted for age, race, and sex.
Tests of significance were performed us-
ing t tests for continuous variables and x2
test for categorical variables. Population-
attributable risk for metformin use on
biochemical B12
deficiency was calcu-
lated from the cross-sectional data using
the Fleiss equation (27).
Polytomous logistic regression was
performed in SUDAAN using "proc mul-
tilog" with a trilevel B12
-status outcome
(vitamin B12
deficiency, borderline defi-
ciency, and normal) to assess the associ-
ation of previously identified risk factors
with biochemical B12
deficiency and bor-
derline deficiency in our study popula-
tion. Risk factors previously identified
for biochemical B12
deficiency were as-
sessed as exposure variables along with
metformin therapy in a full model and
included age, race/ethnicity, sex, BMI
(calculated as weight in kilograms di-
vided by height in meters squared),
and the use of proton pump inhibitors,
H2
blockers, antacids, B12
supplements,
alcohol, and tobacco (12,28). The final
polytomous logistic model adjusted for
age, BMI, insulin, and B12
supplement
use. Alcohol use and smoking could not
be included in the model as .60% of
responses were missing.
RESULTSdIn the final analysis, there
were 575 U.S. adults $50 years of age
with type 2 diabetes using metformin,
1,046 with type 2 diabetes not using met-
formin, and 6,867 without diabetes. The
demographic and biological characteris-
tics of the groups are shown in Table 1.
Among metformin users, mean age was
63.4 6 0.5 years, 50.3% were male,
66.7% were non-Hispanic white, and
40.7% used a supplement containing
B12
. The median duration of metformin
use was 5 years. Compared with those
with type 2 diabetes not taking metfor-
min, metformin users were younger
(P , 0.0001), reported a lower preva-
lence of insulin use (P , 0.001), and
had a shorter duration of diabetes (P =
0.0207). Compared with those without
diabetes, metformin users had a higher
proportion of nonwhite racial groups
(P , 0.0001), a higher proportion of obe-
sity (P,0.0001),alowerprevalenceofmac-
rocytosis (P = 0.0017), a lower prevalence of
supplemental folic acid use (P = 0.0069),
a lower prevalence of supplemental vita-
min B12
use (P = 0.0180), and a lower
prevalence of calcium supplement use
(P = 0.0002). There was a twofold differ-
ence in the prevalence of anemia among
those with type 2 diabetes versus those
without, and no difference between the
groups with diabetes.
The geometric mean serum B12
con-
centration among those with type 2 di-
abetes taking metformin was 317.5
pmol/L. This was significantly lower than
the geometric mean concentration in
those with type 2 diabetes not taking met-
formin (386.7 pmol/L; P = 0.0116) and
those without diabetes (350.8 pmol/L;
P = 0.0011). As seen in Fig. 1, the
weighted prevalence of biochemical B12
deficiency adjusted for age, race, and sex
was 5.8% for those with type 2 diabetes
taking metformin, 2.2% for those with
type 2 diabetes not taking metformin
(P = 0.0002), and 3.3% for those without
diabetes (P = 0.0026). Among the three
aforementioned groups, borderline defi-
ciency was present in 16.2, 5.5, and
8.8%, respectively (P , 0.0001). Apply-
ing the Fleiss formula for calculating at-
tributable risk from cross-sectional data
(27), among all of the cases of biochemi-
cal B12
deficiency, 3.5% of the cases were
attributable to metformin use; and among
those with diabetes, 41% of the deficient
cases were attributable to metformin use.
When the prevalence of biochemical B12
deficiency among those with diabetes tak-
ing metformin was analyzed by duration of
metformin therapy, there was no notable
increase in the prevalence of biochemical
B12
deficiency as the duration of metformin
use increased. The prevalence of biochemi-
cal B12
deficiency was 4.1% among those
taking metformin ,1 year, 6.3% among
those taking metformin $1­3 years,
4.1% among those taking metformin .3­
10 years, and 8.1% among those taking
metformin .10 years (P = 0.3219 for
,1 year vs. .10 years). Similarly, there
was no clear increase in the prevalence of
borderline deficiency as the duration of
metformin use increased (15.9% among
those taking metformin .10 years vs.
11.4% among those taking metformin
,1 year; P = 0.4365).

supplement use. For those without
diabetes, B12
supplement use was associ-
ated with an ;66.7% lower prevalence of
both biochemical B12
deficiency (4.8 vs.
1.6%; P , 0.0001) and borderline de-
ficiency (16.6 vs. 5.5%; P , 0.0001). A
decrease in the prevalence of biochemi-
cal B12
deficiency was seen at all levels
of supplemental B12
intake compared
with nonusers of supplements. Among
those with type 2 diabetes taking met-
formin, supplement use was not associ-
ated with a decrease in the prevalence
of either biochemical B12
deficiency
(5.6 vs. 5.3%; P = 0.9137) or borderline
deficiency (15.5 vs. 8.8%; P = 0.0826).
Among the metformin users who also
used supplements, those who con-
sumed .0­6 mg of B12
had a prevalence
of biochemical B12
deficiency of 14.1%.
However, consumption of a supplement
containing .6 mg of B12
was associated
with a prevalence of biochemical B12
de-
ficiency of 1.8% (P = 0.0273 for linear
trend). Similar trends were seen in the
association of supplemental B12
intake
and the prevalence of borderline defi-
ciency. For those with type 2 diabetes
not taking metformin, supplement use
was also not associated with a decrease
in the prevalence of biochemical B12
de-
ficiency (2.1 vs. 2.0%; P = 0.9568) but was
associated with a 54% reduction in the
prevalence of borderline deficiency (7.8
vs. 3.4%; P = 0.0057 for linear trend).
Table 3 demonstrates the association
of various risk factors with biochemical
B12
deficiency. Metformin therapy was as-
sociated with biochemical B12
deficiency
(odds ratio [OR] 2.89; 95% CI 1.33­6.28)
and borderline deficiency (OR 2.32; 95%
CI 1.31­4.12) in a crude model (results
not shown). After adjusting for age, BMI,
and insulin and supplement use, metfor-
min maintained a significant association
with biochemical B12
deficiency (OR
2.92; 95% CI 1.28­6.66) and borderline
deficiency (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.22­3.85).
Similar to Table 2, B12
supplements were
protective against borderline (OR 0.43;
95% CI 0.23­0.81), but not biochemical,
B12
deficiency (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.34­
1.70) among those with type 2 diabetes.
Among those without diabetes, B12
sup-
plement use was ;70% protective against
biochemical B12
deficiency (OR 0.26; 95%
CI 0.17­0.38) and borderline deficiency
(OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.21­0.35).

Biochemical B12
deficiency and metformin therapy
deficiency as a high-priority topic for re-
search (1). Our results suggest several
findings that add to the complexity and
importance of B12
research and its relation
to diabetes, and offer new insight into the
benefits of B12
supplements. Our data
confirm the relationship between metfor-
min and reduced serum B12
levels beyond
the background prevalence of biochemical
B12
deficiency. Our data demonstrate that
an intake of .0­6 mg of B12
, which in-
cludes the dose most commonly found
in over-the-counter multivitamins, was as-
sociated with a two-thirds reduction of
biochemical B12
deficiency and borderline
deficiency among adults without diabetes.
This relationship has been previously re-
ported with NHANES and Framingham
population data (4,29). In contrast, we
did not find that .0­6 mg of B12
was as-
sociated with a decrease in the prevalence
of biochemical B12
deficiency or borderline
deficiency among adults with type 2 diabe-
testakingmetformin.Thisobservationsug-
gests that metformin reduces serum B12
by a mechanism that is additive to or dif-
ferent from the mechanism in older adults.
It is also possible that metformin may ex-
acerbate the deficiency among older adults
with low serumB12
. Our sample size wastoo
small to determine which amount .6 mg
was associated with maximum protection,
but we did find a dose-response trend.
We were surprised to find that those
with type 2 diabetes not using metformin
had the lowest prevalence of biochemical
B12
deficiency. It is possible that these
individuals may seek medical care more
frequently than the general population
and therefore are being treated for their
biochemical B12
deficiency. Or perhaps,
because this population had a longer du-
ration of diabetes and a higher proportion
of insulin users compared with metformin
users, they have been switched from met-
formin to other diabetic treatments due
to low serum B12
concentrations or un-
controlled glucose levels and these new
treatments may increase serum B12
con-
centrations. Despite the observed effects
of metformin on serum B12
levels, it re-
mains unclear whether or not this reduc-
tion is a public health concern. With
lifetime risks of diabetes estimated to be
one in three and with metformin being a
first-line intervention, it is important to in-
crease our understanding of the effects of
oral vitamin B12
on metformin-associated
biochemical deficiency (20,21).
The strengths of this study include
its nationally representative, population-
based sample, its detailed information on
supplementusage,anditsrelevantbiochemi-
cal markers. This is the first study to use a
nationally representative sample to examine
the association between serum B12
concen-
tration, diabetes status, and metformin use
as well as examine how this relationship
may be modified by vitamin B12
supple-
mentation. The data available regarding
supplement usage provided specific infor-
mation regarding dose and frequency.
This aspect of NHANES allowed us to
observe the dose-response relationship
in Table 2 and to compare it within our
three study groups.
This study is also subject to limita-
tions. First, NHANES is a cross-sectional
survey and it cannot assess time as a fac-
tor, and therefore the results are associ-
ations and not causal relationships.
A second limitation arises in our defini-
tion of biochemical B12
deficiency. There
is no general consensus on how to define
normal versus low serum B12
levels.
Some researchers include the functional
biomarker methylmalonic acid (MMA)
in the definition, but this has yet to be
agreed upon (30­34). Recently, an
NHANES roundtable discussion suggested
that definitions of biochemical B12
defi-
ciency should incorporate one biomarker
(serum B12
or holotranscobalamin) and

one functional biomarker (MMA or total
homocysteine) to address problems with
sensitivity and specificity of the individual
biomarkers. However, they also cited a
need for more research on how the bio-
markers are related in the general popula-
tion to prevent misclassification (34).
MMA was only measured for six of our
survey years; one-third of participants in
our final analysis were missing serum
MMA levels. Moreover, it has recently
been reported that MMA values are signif-
icantly greater among the elderly with di-
abetes as compared with the elderly
without diabetes even when controlling
for serum B12
concentrations and age, sug-
gesting that having diabetes may indepen-
dently increase the levels of MMA (35).
This unique property of MMA in elderly
adults with diabetes makes it unsuitable as
part of a definition of biochemical B12
de-
ficiency in our specific population groups.
Our study may also be subject to misclas-
sification bias. NHANES does not differ-
entiate between diabetes types 1 and 2 in
the surveys; our definition may not cap-
ture adults with type 2 diabetes exclu-
sively. Additionally, we used responses
to the question "Have you received a
physician's diagnosis of diabetes" to cate-
gorize participants as having or not having
diabetes. Therefore, we failed to capture
undiagnosed diabetes. Finally, we could
only assess current metformin use. We
cannot determine if nonmetformin users
have ever used metformin or if they were
not using it at the time of the survey.
Our data demonstrate several im-
portant conclusions. First, there is a clear
association between metformin and bio-
chemical B12
deficiency among adults
with type 2 diabetes. This analysis shows
that 6 mg of B12
offered in most multivita-
mins is associated with two-thirds reduc-
tion in biochemical B12
deficiency in the
general population, and that this same
dose is not associated with protection
against biochemical B12
deficiency among
those with type 2 diabetes taking metfor-
min. Our results have public health and
clinical implications by suggesting that
neither 2.4 mg, the current IOM recom-
mendation for daily B12
intake, nor 6 mg,
the amount found in most multivitamins,
is sufficient for those with type 2 diabetes
taking metformin.
This analysis suggests a need for fur-
ther research. One research design would
be to identify those with biochemical B12
deficiency and randomize them to re-
ceive various doses of supplemental B12
chronically and then evaluate any
improvement in serum B12
concentra-
tions and/or clinical outcomes. Another
design would use existing cohorts to de-
termine clinical outcomes associated
with biochemical B12
deficiency and how
they are affected by B12
supplements at var-
ious doses. Given that a significant propor-
tion of the population $50 years of age
have biochemical B12
deficiency and that
those with diabetes taking metformin
have an even higher proportion of bio-
chemical B12
deficiency, we suggest that
support for further research is a reasonable
priority.
