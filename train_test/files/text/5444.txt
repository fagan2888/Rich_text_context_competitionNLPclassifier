Harnessing the Power of Reputation: Strengths and Limits for Promoting
Cooperative Behaviors

Abstract: Evolutionary approaches have done much to identify the pressures that select for
cooperative sentiment. This helps us understand when and why cooperation will arise, and
applied research shows how these pressures can be harnessed to promote various types of
cooperation. In particular, recent evidence shows how opportunities to acquire a good
reputation can promote cooperation in laboratory and applied settings. Cooperation can be
promoted by tapping into forces like indirect reciprocity, costly signaling, and competitive
altruism. When individuals help others, they receive reputational benefits (or avoid
reputational costs), and this gives people an incentive to help. Such findings can be applied
to promote many kinds of helping and cooperation, including charitable donations, tax
compliance, sustainable and pro-environmental behaviors, risky heroism, and more.
Despite the potential advantages of using reputation to promote positive behaviors, there
are several risks and limits. Under some circumstances, opportunities for reputation will be
ineffective or promote harmful behaviors. By better understanding the dynamics of
reputation and the circumstances under which cooperation can evolve, we can better design
social systems to increase the rate of cooperation and reduce conflict.

Why Help?
Human cooperation is truly impressive. Humans regularly incur great costs to help
kin and non-kin. In terms of formal helping, in Canada in 2007 alone, 46% of people
volunteered 166 hours, on average, and 84% of people donated a total of almost 10 billion
dollars (Hall, Lasby, Ayer, and Gibbons, 2009). This formal help is dwarfed by the vast
amount of informal helping performed in favors, information exchange, tips, and even
restraint from performing selfish behaviors. Canadians are by no means alone in their
generosity, so we must ask: why are humans so generous to others, even towards non-kin?

A first pass glance at natural selection would suggest that helping others would be
disfavored when there are costs associated with helping, because those who avoid the costs
would have an advantage over those who pay them. Evolutionists have long known that
organisms do not act "for the good of the species". Nevertheless, costly helping is
ubiquitous, so the question is: why? What factors have caused cooperative sentiments to
arise? This is a central puzzle in evolution. An answer to this question can help us to foster
helpful behaviors by creating situations to promote helping. Given the importance of
cooperation on both local and global scales, it is crucial to understand the selective
pressures that maintain all forms of cooperation.
Why a Functional Approach is Necessary for Promoting Cooperation
Much research seeks to identify the proximate psychological mechanisms that
trigger helping behavior within individuals (e.g., neural pathways, specific emotions like
empathy (Batson et al., 1997) or "warm glow" (Andreoni, 1990)). Other research examines
how these psychological mechanisms develop within an individual's lifetime (e.g., learning
(Clark, 1975), gene-environment interactions (Knafo and Plomin, 2006)). These are both
important questions, but it is also important to understand the function of these cooperative
sentiments. Why do they exist at all? What are the advantages of possessing them? And
what selective pressures cause them to persist? Together, these three research areas ­
mechanism, development, and evolutionary function ­ represent three of Tinbergen's
(1968) four "Levels of Analysis" (the fourth being phylogeny), and an understanding of all
four levels is necessary.
In particular, it is important to understand evolutionary function in order to produce
social change. By understanding the function of cooperative behavior, we can change social
situations to allow for more of that behavior. For example, which would be more effective:
a) understanding what selective pressures have caused cooperative sentiment to arise, and
then using that knowledge to create (or mimic) situations that are conducive to long-term
cooperation because those selective forces are present; or b) investigating what specific
emotions are involved in charity in order to trigger those emotions, hoping that the
triggered emotional response is specific enough to affect charitable behavior, and hoping
that it is not subject to habituation or extinction from a lack of reinforcement? Compared
with the former, the latter seems hopelessly indirect, temporary, and possibly ineffective.
This is why identifying the function of cooperative sentiment is paramount for producing
lasting change.
To understand function, we need to know what consequences a cooperative person
tends to experience. Our evolved prosocial sentiments cause us to perform helpful
behavior, so how do others respond to this? I argue that cooperative behavior often
produces reputational benefits, which outweigh the costs. However, it is important to note
that not every instance of helping will result in such benefits, nor does it need to. Our
evolved sentiments may occasionally be triggered in ways that do not advance our fitness
(Haley and Fessler, 2005; West, El Mouden, and Gardner, 2011), and occasional errors are
inevitable in any decision-making process (e.g., Nesse, 2005; Todd, 2001). Instead,
prosocial sentiments like empathy are adaptive on average, because reputational
Harnessing the power of reputation

opportunities are often present and important, and the average reputational benefits of
acting on those sentiments outweigh the costs of occasionally helping when one cannot
acquire a reputation (Delton, Krasnow, Cosmides, and Tooby, 2012). As such, reputation
can continue to have a powerful effect on helpful behavior as long as real reputational
consequences arise frequently enough to make such helping occasionally worthwhile.
Why Generalized Helping?
There is much research on helping that benefits kin (e.g., Hamilton, 1964), has
direct personal benefits to the helper (e.g., Diekmann, 1985, Kümmerli et al., 2007),
benefits someone whom the helper has some stake in (Kokko, Johnstone, and Clutton-
Brock et al., 2001; Roberts, 2005), or is directly reciprocated by the recipient (Axelrod,
1984; Trivers, 1971). These situations are well-studied in evolutionary studies, and I have
reviewed them and their applications elsewhere (Barclay, 2011a; Barclay and Van Vugt, in
press). Because humans also cooperate with those who are neither kin nor reciprocal
partners, I will focus on one specific and particularly selective pressure ­ reputation ­ in its
various forms. By understanding these selective pressures, we can learn to harness them to
increase helpful behaviors.
Indirect Reciprocity
People who help others tend to receive help when they need it. Some of this help is
directly reciprocated by the recipient in the manner of "you scratch my back and I'll scratch
yours" (i.e., "direct reciprocity") (e.g., Axelrod, 1984). In addition, help is often indirectly
reciprocated by people other than the recipient (i.e., "indirect reciprocity") (Nowak and
Sigmund, 2005). Helpers earn a good reputation, and this makes them more likely to
receive aid than non-helpers. This pattern is shown to be evolutionarily stable in many
mathematical models and game theoretical simulations (reviewed by Nowak and Sigmund,
2005), and many experimental and field studies have shown that those who give are more
likely to receive, even from those whom they have never personally given to (e.g., Bolton,
Katok, and Ockenfels, 2005; Gurven, Allen-Arave, Hill, and Hurtado, 2000; Milinski,
Semmann, Bakker, and Krambeck, 2001; Seinen and Schram, 2006; Wedekind and
Milinski, 2000). There is even evidence for indirect reciprocity in cleaner fish: client fish
avoid cleaners who are observed to give "bad service" to other clients; good cleaners
receive more clients (Bshary and Grutter, 2006).
Punishment
Those who refuse to cooperate do not only face a lack of rewards; they may also
experience active punishment from others. Such punishment can include monetary fines
(Fehr and Gächter, 2002; Ostrom, 1990), public shaming and criticism (Barr, 2001; Fessler,
2002), negative gossip (Piazza and Bering, 2008), and possibly physical threats. These
punishments promote cooperation because they make it costly to refuse to cooperate. In a
recent example, the British government shamed comedian Jimmy Carr into stopping a
dubious tax avoidance scheme; this reputation-based shaming had strong tangible
consequences because it exposed actions that risked alienating his audiences (thereby
Harnessing the power of reputation
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(5). 2012. -871-
reducing his income).
Laboratory and field data show that people are very willing to impose costs upon
others who do not contribute their fair share of time, effort, or money to a common cause
(e.g., Cordell and McKean, 1992; Ostrom, Walker, and Gardner, 1992; Price, 2005;
Yamagishi, 1986). Studies using brain-scanning technology suggest that people experience
pleasure when non-cooperators receive punishment (de Quervain et al., 2004; Singer et al.,
2006). Punishment and indirect reciprocity can work together to promote cooperation
(Rockenbach and Milinski, 2006), though punishment may be more cost-effective in
situations where unanimous cooperation is required (Oliver, 1980). But why be the one to
perform the punishment, given the personal costs in terms of time, effort, and retaliation
risk (Oliver, 1980; Yamagishi, 1986)? One solution is that punishers receive reputational
benefits by signaling their dislike of unfairness, ability to punish, and intolerance of being
exploited (Barclay, 2006, submitted; Horita, 2010; Nelissen, 2008; though see Kiyonari and
Barclay, 2008). Altogether, punishment supports cooperation by targeting those with bad
reputations, and reputation can support punishment itself.
Costly Signaling
Suppose that you possess a desirable quality that you want to advertise to others,
such as wealth, genetic quality, or good character. How can you do so believably? One way
is to perform or possess something that would be too costly to be worth it for someone who
did not honestly possess that quality (Searcy and Nowicki, 2005). For example, a peacock's
tail is very costly to build, and the benefits of possessing a big one are only worth it for a
high quality peacock (Zahavi and Zahavi, 1997). Similarly, Ferraris and mansions likely
function as an honest display of wealth in humans (Veblen, 1899/1994). Such signaling
need not be conscious, just as a peacock does not consciously grow its tail to attract mates.
Extravagant generosity may similarly function as a (probably unconscious) display
of abilities or resource-holding potential. For example, philanthropy requires money to
spare, and Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are known in North America as much for their
philanthropy as for their wealth. Hunting big game requires many abilities, and good
hunters receive widespread recognition when they share their kills (e.g., Smith and Bliege
Bird, 2000); as a result, they have higher reproductive success than non-hunters (Smith,
2004), including more extra-marital affairs (Kaplan and Hill, 1985). Heroes are praised for
successfully taking physical risks for others, and recent evidence suggests they are more
desirable as mates (Farthing, 2005; Kelly and Dunbar, 2001). Audiences attend and
respond to such acts because they carry useful information about the helper's abilities
and/or resources, and the possibility of receiving something makes such acts particularly
attractive to attend to (Smith and Bliege Bird, 2000).
In addition to signaling resources or abilities, helpful behavior can signal
cooperative intent and concern for others. In long-term interactions, helpful behavior at
time A would not be worth it for someone who intends to defect at time B and face mutual
defection in each subsequent interaction (André, 2010). As such, one's helping at time A
predicts one's helping at time B, albeit imperfectly (e.g., Kurzban and Houser, 2005). Not
surprisingly, people are more trusting of those who give money to charities or to fellow
group members (e.g., Albert, Güth, Kirchler, and Maciejovsky, 2007; Barclay, 2004, 2006;
Harnessing the power of reputation
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(5). 2012. -872-
Keser, 2003). The costs of religious rituals may also function as signals of cooperative
intent because the subjective costs would not be worth it for non-believers. As a result,
costly religious rituals are associated with higher levels of trust (Sosis, 2004). Charitable
donations are often religious donations (Hall et al., 2009). It is also possible that other
groups require costly rituals, volunteering, or philanthropy in order to screen out
uncooperative applicants (e.g., fraternities, Masons, medical schools). For a more thorough
review of cooperation as an honest signal of abilities, resources, and cooperative intent, and
the empirical evidence for each, see Barclay (2010b).
Harnessing the Power of Reputation
The three theories above have their differences, but they all rely on people acquiring
reputations for (non-)cooperation. As such, their most obvious prediction is that people will
be more cooperative when they can acquire a good reputation (e.g., if their cooperation gets
announced to others, or if they receive some badge indicative of their cooperation). This
prediction has been abundantly confirmed in many domains, including experimental games
(e.g., Barclay, 2004; Hardy and Van Vugt, 2006; Hoffman, McCabe, Schachat, and Smith,
1994; Milinski, Semmann, and Krambeck, 2002; Rege and Telle, 2004), volunteering
(Bereczkei, Birkas, and Kerekes, 2007), contributions towards educating others about
climate change (Milinski, Semmann, Krambeck, and Marotzke, 2006), charitable donations
(Harbaugh, 1998; Karlan and McConnell, 2012), voter turnout (Gerber, Green, and
Larimer, 2008), blood donations (Low and Heinen, 1993), socially responsible purchasing
(Kimura et al., 2012), and simulated tax donations (Coricelli, Joffily, Montmarquette, and
Villeval, 2010). Making people think about status can increase benevolence (Griskevicius
et al., 2007). Even fear of gossip or disapproval can stimulate cooperation (Masclet,
Noussair, Tucker, and Villeval, 2003; Piazza and Bering, 2008; Xiao and Houser, 2009).
This increased cooperation is sometimes strategic (Semmann, Krambeck, and Milinski,
2004; Barclay and Willer, 2007), but not always; observation might even cause a genuine
increase in cooperative sentiments such as empathy, shame, or guilt. Whether strategic or
genuine, it should be easy to add reputational opportunities to many systems, which will
increase people's cooperation (e.g., announcing people's cooperation in any domain, or
giving identifiable cues or badges to cooperators) (Griskevicius, Cantú, and Van Vugt,
2012; Low and Heinen, 1993). For an additional review of this work, see Griskevicius and
colleagues (2012).
People are so sensitive to their reputations that they will respond to minimal cues of
being observed. Haley and Fessler (2005) showed that people donated more money to their
partners in an experimental game when there were stylized eyespots on their computer
screen than when such eyespots were absent. These results have been replicated numerous
times with other types of eyes (Burnham and Hare, 2007; Mifune, Hashimoto, and
Yamagishi, 2010) including three dots in an eyes-like configuration (Rigdon, Ishii, Watabe,
and Kitayama, 2009), and seem to be driven by implicit expectations of a good reputation
(Oda, Niwa, Honma, and Hiraishi, 2011). Field experiments have shown that the presence
of eyes increases the amounts that people pay for coffee on an "honour system" (Bateson et
al., 2006) and reduces the amount of litter that people leave in cafeterias (Ernest-Jones,
Harnessing the power of reputation
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(5). 2012. -873-
Nettle, and Bateson, 2011). This all suggests that reputation can be harnessed even with
minimal cues, though the effects of such minimal cues may only be transient (see limitation
#3 below; Sparks and Barclay, submitted).
People give more when observed, and they give the most when competing over
partnerships (Barclay and Willer, 2007). Engaging in competitive altruism makes people
more desirable as partners and gives them greater access to social partnerships (Barclay,
2004; Barclay and Willer, 2007; Roberts, 1998; Sylwester and Roberts, 2010), sometimes
including romantic partnerships (Barclay, 2010a; Iredale, Van Vugt, and Dunbar, 2008). In
such a market for partners, it pays to "keep up with the Joneses' generosity" and possibly
exceed it in order to get access to the best partners. Generosity is a relative term: someone
who gives more than average looks good, whereas someone who gives less than average
looks bad and risks losing the competition for partners. As such, people are highly sensitive
to others' cooperation, for example, they give more money to radio fundraising when told
about others' high contributions (Shang and Croson, 2006), and make more pro-
environmental decisions like cutting energy usage or re-using hotel towels when told that
most others do so (Allcott, 2011; Goldstein, Griskevicius, and Cialdini, 2007). Competitive
altruism explains why people are so sensitive about appearing less generous, as well as why
generosity can sometimes escalate. People are naturally competitive, and we can harness
this to foster competitive altruism including competitive sustainability (Griskevicius et al.,
2012). For example, we can advertise the contributions of the best cooperators, publicly
name the biggest philanthropists or the most prosocial individuals and corporations (Duffy
and Kornienko, 2006; Griskevicius et al., 2012), and increase people's ability to meet high
cooperators and assort into the most cooperative groups and partnerships (Barclay, 2011b).
Reputations are also important in business and consumerism (Frank, 2004). Many
companies and consumers are aware of this, and trader reputations are already used to
facilitate trust on Internet sites such as eBay, Amazon, and TripAdvisor. Consumers may
engage in "conspicuous conservation" when buying "green" products like a Toyota Prius
(Sexton and Sexton, 2011), especially after they are primed to think about their own
reputations (Griskevicius, Tybur, and Van den Bergh, 2010), or when they are presented
with social comparisons about what others do (Allcott, 2011; Goldstein et al., 2007). For
example, people purchase more fair trade products when being observed (Kimura et al.,
2012). Because of this, we can harness reputations to promote socially responsible
consumerism (or at least less harmful consumerism). This can affect corporate behavior;
companies often care about their reputation and this indicates that they are aware of the
need to appear somewhat socially responsible (or at least not harmful). After all,
corporations respond to market demands, and consumer boycotts have had some success at
influencing corporations. Having more competitors will increase companies' need for
social responsibility (or appearance thereof), as market size affects how generous one needs
to be in social competition (Barclay, 2011b). Furthermore, individual CEOs can be made to
care about their personal reputations if they are seen as responsible for the socially harmful
or beneficial policies of their companies. Thus, attaching reputations to socially
(ir)responsible products can alter both consumption and production patterns.

When Will Reputation Work?
The effectiveness of reputation at promoting an action will depend on how that
action is viewed. If an act is seen as "good", then reputational opportunities will result in
people performing it more often. In particular, "good" people will perform it more often
when the costs deter "bad" people, such that the act carries useful information about a
person's character. Also, "good" people should not do "bad things" knowingly (though see
limitation #7 below).
What determines whether an act is seen as "good", "bad", or "neutral"? This
question is not always easy to answer. Some acts are almost intrinsically good, such as
saving others' lives. Other acts are potentially ambiguous: is public smoking good, bad, or
neutral? What about drunk driving? Recycling? Purchasing biofuels? Supporting Cuba?
One must have information on how these acts help or harm others, otherwise they may
appear neutral. Someone who knows the harms (or benefits) of an act but does (or does not
do) it anyway can be inferred to be a "bad" person. Drinking and driving campaigns have
been successful at broadcasting these harms and creating reputational pressures against
drunk driving, and campaigns against littering and second-hand smoke have also enjoyed
some success. British propaganda in World War II generated social norms about
conservation. One can imagine similar campaigns to increase awareness of the social harms
of pollution, unsustainable consumption, and buying socially irresponsible products, and to
shame those who take part in these activities. Similarly, one could educate about the shared
benefits of sustainability, recycling, public transit usage, full tax compliance, tree-planting,
voting, social action, or any other campaign (see also Kazdin, 2009).
This education effectively increases reputational pressures. For example, people are
particularly likely to donate to the fight against climate change when they are non-
anonymous if they have already been educated about the dangers of climate change
(Milinski, van Dijk, DeCremer, and Wilke, 2006). Thus, education and reputation work
together such that education creates the reputational pressures, and reputational pressures
give people a big reason to care. Without reputational pressures, cooperation can decline
even among people who are fully aware of the effects of their actions - this is the logic of
the "tragedy of the commons" that reputation "solves" (Hardin, 1968; Milinski et al.,
2002).
Limitations and Unknowns about Harnessing Reputation
There are currently several important limitations and unknowns associated with
harnessing reputation, all of which could undermine or reverse any attempts to promote
positive behavior. The following limitations are in approximately increasing order of how
problematic each one is, and includes potential remedies (see also Barclay, 2011a).
1) Reputational benefits must outweigh the cost of helping
To be effective, incentives must be sufficient to outweigh costs of acting. This
point, although obvious, is easy to forget in practice. If the expected reputational benefits
do not outweigh the costs of helping, then they will not be effective at eliciting helping, and
Harnessing the power of reputation
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(5). 2012. -875-
may even suppress helping (see "crowding out" in limitation #6).
2) Reputational cues must be stronger than other situational factors
Some cues of reputation are very strong, like immediate monetary consequences or
a large audience of attractive members of the opposite sex. Other cues are relatively weak,
like eyespots in the background of one's environment (Haley and Fessler, 2005). Naturally,
stronger situations or cues should have more impact than weaker ones (e.g., Xiao and
Houser, 2009; see also Cooper and Withey, 2009). When non-reputational factors are
present and strong, like strong internalized social norms in a situation, then these may
overwhelm weak reputational cues. More research should determine which cues (e.g., sex,
status, and group membership of audiences) are most important to reputation.
3) People may habituate to non-informative cues of reputation
Humans are excellent learners, which includes eventually ceasing behaviors that
receive no reinforcement. If cues of reputation are not eventually followed by actual
reputation that matters, then people should eventually come to ignore these cues. For
example, eyespots are a (false) cue of reputation, and Sparks and Barclay (submitted) found
that eyespots lose their effectiveness at eliciting cooperation in experimental games if the
eyes are constantly present. Soetevent (2005) found that reputational cues were only
temporarily effective in eliciting church donations. We might also predict that people will
eventually respond less to the scrutiny of audiences who do not react to cooperation or free-
riding, or who cannot have any tangible effect on one's status or fitness (including by
communicating with fitness-relevant audiences). To remain effective, false cues of
reputation (e.g., eyespots) must be changed frequently, or occasionally followed by real
observation, and observation must occasionally be followed by reaction.
4) Not everyone values reputation
Some people may not need or value reputation (Barclay and Reeve, 2012; Rege and
Telle, 2004), such that reputational incentives will not work on them. These can include
individualists, high status people, autistic people, or psychopaths. These types may require
obvious, tangible, immediate, and strong reward or punishment. Alternately, social systems
should be designed to avoid having these non-responders drag down the cooperation of
others, possibly by focusing on the most cooperative people rather than the least
cooperative.
5) Reputation only pays off in the long-term
It is only worth acquiring a reputation if one will be around long enough to
eventually benefit from it. Accordingly, people who devalue the future tend to cooperate
less in experimental games (Harris and Madden, 2002), and are predicted to value
sustainability less (Griskvicius et al., 2012). Luckily, people's valuation of the future can
vary adaptively according to situational cues (Wilson and Daly, 2004) and life
circumstances (reviewed by Griskevicius et al., 2012). As such, anything that increases a
person's perceived "shadow of the future" should increase their sensitivity to reputation,
including a perceived future within a group.
Harnessing the power of reputation
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(5). 2012. -876-
6) Extrinsic incentives "crowd out" intrinsic motivations
Many people seem to have internalized norms about helping others such that they
genuinely value helping (Fehr and Fischbacher, 2004; Simpson and Willer, 2008).
However, much research shows that extrinsic incentives can reduce people's intrinsic
motivations (for reviews, see Deci, Koestner, and Ryan, 1999; Bowles, 2008). In addition
to being ineffective, extrinsic incentives can make situations even worse: Gneezy and
Rustichini (2000) found that parents were more likely to be late to pick up their children
from daycare when there were fines present. Similarly, punishment of non-cooperators
undermines trust, possibly because it obscures people's motivations for cooperating
(Mulder et al., 2006). Because of this, would-be social engineers must be very careful that
any extrinsic reputational benefits do not reduce or "crowd out" intrinsic motivations for
cooperation. One solution is to use implicit incentives like verbal rewards, which do not
reduce intrinsic motivations (Deci et al., 1999), yet can still be effective at promoting
positive behaviors (Barr, 2001; Masclet et al., 2003). Another solution is to give people
opportunities to create their own informal sanctions rather than relying on top-down
explicit incentives (though see limitation #4 above).
7) Reputation can promote negative behaviors
Wealth and power are often signaled through non-generous behaviors, such as
conspicuous consumption (Frank, 2000; Veblen, 1899/1994) or physical and social
displays which do not benefit others. Furthermore, individuals may also need to establish
their toughness, unwillingness to tolerate exploitation, or risk-acceptance (e.g., Chagnon,
1997; Daly and Wilson, 1988). As such, under some circumstances, reputational
opportunities can increase negative behaviors such as aggression (Griskevicius et al., 2009)
and risk-taking (Chen, Baker, Braver, and Li, 2000). In environments where such traits are
valued, would-be social engineers must ensure that they only create reputational
opportunities for positive behaviors (e.g., broadcasting people's cooperation but not their
other behaviors) or they must allow negative behaviors to be channeled toward good ends
(e.g., signaling toughness by punishing non-cooperators: Barclay, submitted).
8) Reputations can be manipulated
People will sometimes give to others when observed, only to be selfish when
anonymous (Barclay and Willer, 2007; Semmann et al., 2004). Gossip can also be used to
falsely increase or decrease someone's reputation (Hess and Hagen, 2006). Corporations
are well aware of this: "green-washing" refers to attempts to make environmentally harmful
products or actions appear environmentally responsible, and companies may try to
manipulate their online reputations on internet sites like eBay, Amazon, or TripAdvisor.
The greater the reputational pressures, the more worthwhile it is to manipulate one's
reputation or the reputation of one's competitors, even at significant cost. Potential
solutions to this include: increasing reputations to include all information necessary to
judge an issue, using public costly signals to guarantee honesty and commitment, or
increasing the degree of partner (or consumer) choice to make it easier to replace a
potentially dishonest partner with a genuine one. On a more public scale, increased funding
for watchdogs such as "Truth in Advertising" would help maintain the accuracy of the
Harnessing the power of reputation
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(5). 2012. -877-
information that people use to make their consumer choices.
9) Identifying reputational incentives may reduce them
If you thought that someone was acting morally solely to receive social benefits,
would you still trust them as much? Probably not. When someone's motivation for helping
is unclear, it can reduce the reputational benefits that he or she receives because it makes
the helping less effective as a signal of good character. People may even deliberately call
attention to such benefits in order to downplay the generosity of their competitors. This
may be currently difficult to resolve because there is little theoretical or empirical work on
the details of how signals of cooperative intent work. Some potential solutions include: a)
creating subtle opportunities for reputational benefit while strictly avoiding mention of
such benefits; b) announcing people's generosity on their behalf so they can avoid
"shameless self-promotion"; c) comparing people who acquire a reputation via helping
with people who don't help at all, or with people who acquire a reputation in less positive
ways like conspicuous consumption. A focus on the appropriate comparisons should help
maintain at least some reputational benefits.
Conclusions
Reputation represents a largely untapped resource for eliciting all types of
cooperative behaviors. The above limitations and unknowns about reputation are not
insurmountable problems, as careful planning can circumvent them. Some may inspire
more theoretical and empirical research about the dynamics and creation of reputation.
Because reputation focuses on the ultimate function(s) of cooperation instead of merely its
proximate psychological causes, a mature science of reputation can help to produce long-
lasting solutions for promoting cooperation.
