Since the 2010 general election, the Coalition government
has brought the issue of Islamophobia much more firmly into
the political and policy spaces than its New Labour predeces-
sor. This can be seen in the establishing of the All Party
Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Islamophobia, the Cross-
Government Working Group (CGWG) on Anti-Muslim
Hatred (CGWG), and in a more populist fashion, in the sug-
gestion by the cochair of the Conservative Party--Baroness
Sayeeda Warsi--that Islamophobia has passed "the dinner
table test" (Guardian, 2011): that the expression of anti-Mus-
lim and anti-Islamic sentiment has become socially accept-
able through conversational civility. To what extent also is it
evidence that the Coalition, unlike its New Labour predeces-
sors, is happy to "do God" (Guardian, 2010)? Irrespective of
the drivers, Islamophobia is now firmly established on the
political and policy radar; interesting given that since the
publication of the Commission on British Muslims and
Islamophobia's (CBMI) report by the Runnymede Trust in
1997 (the Runnymede report)--the first British policy docu-
ment relating to Islamophobia--policy responses to the phe-
nomenon have been scant, indirect, and somewhat implicit.
Consequently, developments and discourses emanating from
the Coalition are as unexpected as they are unprecedented.
Why then might Islamophobia be on the policy agenda now?
What has changed?
Given Islamophobia's timeliness, relatively little schol-
arly work has been produced, which focuses on governmen-
tal policy responses to tackling the phenomenon.
Consequently, such a consideration is possibly somewhat
overdue. Acknowledging this gap and the shift in Coalition
thinking, this article critically analyses British governmental
policy responses and approaches to Islamophobia over the
past two decades. Focusing on three key issues--definition,
evidence, and political differences--this article offers a brief
overview of what Islamophobia might--and might not--be.
From here, it contextualizes the contemporary setting

Passing the Dinner Table Test:
Retrospective and Prospective
Approaches to Tackling Islamophobia in
Britain
Chris Allen1
Abstract
Through establishing the All Party Parliamentary Group on Islamophobia and Cross-Government Working Group on Anti-
Muslim Hatred, the Coalition government has afforded significance to Islamophobia. Focusing on definition, evidence, and
politics, this article considers British governmental policy approaches to tackling Islamophobia over the past 15 years. Tracing
religiously based discrimination from the 1980s to the publication of the Runnymede Trust's 1997 groundbreaking report
into Islamophobia, this article explores how the New Labour government sought primarily to address Islamophobia through
a broadening of the equalities framework. Against a backdrop of 9/11 and 7/7, a concurrent security and antiterror agenda
had detrimental impacts. Under the Coalition, there has been a marked change. Considering recent developments and
initiatives, the Coalition has seemingly rejected Islamophobia as an issue of equalities preferring approaches more akin to
tackling Anti-Semitism. In conclusion, definition, evidence, and politics are revisited to offer a prospective for future British
governmental policy.

upon a wide range of policy and academic sources, docu-
ments from various governmental sources (including some
that are unavailable in the public domain) and research notes
from exploring Islamophobia at British and European levels
from the past decade are also drawn upon.
Acknowledging the international resonance of the phe-
nomenon, its different manifestations in different national
and international settings, and the differing approaches to
tackling it in these same locations, this article contributes
knowledge toward understanding governmental policy
approaches to tackling Islamophobia as well as Islamophobia
per se. The wider body of work remains embryonic where
the focus has been on theoretical analyses (Allen, 2010;
Malik, 2010; Sayyid & Vakil, 2010), media (Petley &
Richardson, 2011; Poole, 2002; Richardson, 2004), applied
contexts (e.g., education; Shaik, 2006), specific locations
(Reeves, Abbas, & Pedroso, 2009), political movements
(Allen, 2011a), or from within specific disciplines (Sheriden,
2006). As Campling (1997) observes from research into race
relations and equalities, it is easy to be overly "introspective,
over-theoretical and disconnected from policy concerns"
(p.1), something which is true of Islamophobia. Where
research has focused on policy, most have disproportionately
focused on associated topics or those conflated with Islam or
Muslims rather than with Islamophobia itself. This can be
seen in the focus on antiterrorism (Kundnani, 2009; Spalek
& McDonald, 2010) and integration (Joppke, 2009;
Mandeville, 2009; Modood, Triandafyllidou, & Zapata-
Barrero, 2006; Schain, 2010; Sinno, 2008) among others.
Alcock's (2003) reflection therefore has resonance: "the rac-
ism that black people in Britain experience is thus not the
same thing as reaction to ethnic differences" (p. 290). As the
Islamophobia Muslims experience in Britain is not the same
as reaction to religious or theological differences, what
Parekh (2006) suggests comes under the moniker the
"Muslim question." As Alcock clarifies, the focus "is thus
not race, but racism" (p. 290). Here, therefore, the focus is
Islamophobia.
Knowing Islamophobia
Recognition of Islamophobia, let alone political recognition,
spans little more than two decades (Allen, 2010; CBMI,
1997). Those two decades, however, have been marked by at
times emotive exchanges about what Islamophobia is and
what is not. British in coinage, the Runnymede report defined
Islamophobia as "a useful shorthand way of referring to the
dread or hatred of Islam . . . and, therefore, to fear or dislike
all or most Muslims" (CBMI, 1997, p. 1). In explanation, it
suggested that Islamophobia was identifiable through "recur-
ring characteristic[s] of closed views" (1997, p. 1). From its
typology of "closed views," Islamophobia was identifiable
where: Muslims and Islam were represented as or seen to be
the enemy, violent, aggressive, threatening, separate, and
"other". Despite the definition and typology having been
widely adopted, both have been shown to be flawed. For
Allen (2010), if the "closed views" equal Islamophobia, then
the opposite "open views"--set out in the report as a coun-
terbalance or more rational "view"--must equal Islamophilia,
itself as unwelcome and unwarranted as Islamophobia. For
those seeking to refute or reject Islamophobia, such a binary
approach offers convenience: Tackling Islamophobia neces-
sitates the imposition of an unmovable and uncritical
(Islamophilic) shield behind which all criticism and ques-
tioning of Islam and Muslims, irrespective of legitimacy is
deflected or repealed. For critics, therefore, all discussion
and debate is forced into being either "Islamophobic" or
"Islamophilic." In doing so, the nuance and complexity that
characterizes much of what sits between the binaries is inap-
propriately referred to in generalized terms and in largely
patronizing and phoney ways (Allen, 2010). This widespread
and uncritical adoption of the Runnymede definition and
typology is therefore seen to be causal in the failure to effec-
tively communicate not only what Islamophobia is but also
to convince politicians and policy makers that a response is
required (Allen, 2010).
Usage of the term Islamophobia is also problematic.
Shyrock (2010) suggests that the usage is oversimplified and
"impervious to nuance" (2010, p. 9), whereas for Allen
(2010), it is routinely conceived and used in weak and uncon-
vincing ways. Sayyid (2010) offers differentiation:
Analytically, Islamophobia is rendered "a nebulous and per-
petually contested category" (p. 2); polemically, it is locked
in the discourses of those with grievances, smugly pontificat-
ing or seeking the ear of politicians. For him, usage is inef-
fectual given the lack of meaning attributed to it by those
who use it. Similar criticisms are posited when charges of
Islamophobia are made, lacking specificity, relying on con-
jecture and accusation, therefore being open to challenge and
rejection (Vakil, 2010). As Vakil (2010) reflects, given such
contention, it might be easier to suspend engagement with
Islamophobia linguistically and conceptually. However, as
he adds, this miscasts the issue as the term is established in
the contemporary lexicon and has had considerable invest-
ment from critics and advocates alike. Relevant here is the
fact that the Coalition government is now openly using the
term. Although as before, what matters will be what is meant
by the Coalition's usage of the term.
Unsurprisingly, the government's definition and mean-
ings of Islamophobia remain protean.As evidence of this, the
APPG has prioritized the need for a working definition to
base its work program on (Allen, 2011a). So does the CGWG,
noting how "the term Islamophobia is not contained within
traditional dictionaries and there are many different interpre-
tations as to its meaning . . . the term may be misleading in
the truest sense" (Cross Party Working Group on
Islamophobia & Anti-Muslim Hate Crime, 2012b). Similar
can be seen at the European level also. Research commis-
sioned by the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and
Xenophobia (EUMC) following the events of 11 September
Allen 3
2001 (9/11) highlighted how despite member states being
asked to monitor levels of Islamophobia, less than half of had
a working definition of what exactly it was they were moni-
toring (Allen & Nielsen, 2002). At the European level, the
EUMC has pursued research into Islamophobia (EUMC,
2007a, 2007b). In one of two reports from 2006, the detri-
mental impact of there being no legally binding or widely
accepted definition of Islamophobia was noted (EUMC,
2007a). However, the EUMC did acknowledge the Council
of Europe's 2005 definition: "the fear of or prejudiced view-
point towards Islam, Muslims and matters pertaining to them
. . . [taking] the shape of daily forms of racism and discrimi-
nation or more violent forms, Islamophobia is a violation of
human rights" (EUMC, 2007a, p. 61). While admittedly
broad, the definition offers some advantages over the
Runnymede alternative. While Runnymede's Islamophobia
was an unfounded and irrational phenomenon, the Council of
Europe attempt goes further by recognizing the more routine,
consequential and exclusionary characteristics and conse-
quences, the "daily forms of racism and discrimination and
more violent forms."
The Council of Europe definition also has resonance with
theoretical models of Islamophobia. For Allen (2010), the
theory is that Islamophobia functions as an ideology, through
modes of operation (e.g., the media or political discourse),
and as exclusionary practices including violence as a tool for
exclusion. The latter function is crucial to the policy setting
as evidence of exclusionary practices will be that which best
convinces and prompts politicians and policy makers of the
need for change or at least a policy response. The Council of
Europe approach also resonates with Allen's notion that
Islamophobia is not always unfounded and irrational. Both
acknowledge that Islamophobia can be a "prejudiced view-
point" as much as fear, going beyond the pathological and
reductivism of the Runnymede approach. While still broad,
the Council of Europe definition therefore offers a way to
incorporate greater nuance and complexity, and so it is posi-
tive that the CGWG has used as a start point (Cross Party
Working Group on Islamophobia & Anti-Muslim Hate
Crime, 2012b). Whatever approach is preferred, however,
the APPG and the CGWG would clearly benefit from offer-
ing some clarity in defining Islamophobia. In doing so, they
might better manage expectations about what might be real-
istically achievable at the same time as proposing a policy-
friendly definition.
Before Runnymede
Discrimination on the basis of religion clearly precedes the
emergence of Islamophobia in the 1990s as does governmen-
tal engagement with faith and religious issues also. As well
as there being a greater political openness to the more social
and civic version of religion since the mid-1980s
(McLoughlin, 2010), so too has a greater impetus been iden-
tifiable toward tackling inequalities. While Jenkins and
Solomos (1989) rightly acknowledge how at the level of
national governmental there was "little agreement about
what should be done . . . to help break down racially dis-
criminatory barriers" (p. 3); for Cooper (2004), the same was
not always true away from Westminster. Those on the politi-
cal left in the urban conurbations were becoming increas-
ingly driven to find effective strategies to tackling what they
saw as rising inequalities and discrimination. Rather than
developing new policies and legislation, they focused on
extending prevailing principles of equality to those with
"new"--and controversial--markers of identity. Such mark-
ers went beyond traditional understandings, sexual orienta-
tion, for instance, being seen as more than a form of conduct.
Likewise, religion is seen as being more than beliefs and
practices. Achieving only minor breakthroughs at govern-
mental level, Cooper (2004) suggests these left a legacy that
duly influenced the way markers of discrimination were con-
ceived, formalized, and afforded protection years later.
Still, the recognition of discrimination on the basis of reli-
gion was largely invisible in the British political spaces for
much of the 20th century, excepting the Northern Irish con-
text. This changed in the late 1980s when calls for religious
discrimination to be made unlawful emerged in the aftermath
of the Satanic Verses. This acted, according to Weller (2006),
as both a lightning rod and magnifying glass for Britain's
Muslim communities: the lightning rod galvanizing Muslim
communities and organizations to use religion as a marker of
individual and corporate identity; the magnifying glass plac-
ing Muslims, their communities, and organizations under
increased public and political scrutiny. However, it was not
until the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) called for
religious discrimination to be made unlawful in 1991 that
some momentum became evident: "It is at present within the
law to incite hatred against a religious community and to dis-
criminate against a person because of their religion, unless
affiliation to a religion happens to be recognised as member-
ship of an ethnic group" (cited in Blakemore & Drake, 1996,
p. 115). Little evidence was, however, available. Given that
much of this was anecdotal or founded upon conjecture, so
the claims were largely rejected and dismissed as a conse-
quence of the "lightning rod."
The first Muslim organization to call for protection
against discrimination on the basis of religion was the UK
Action Committee on Islamic Affairs (UKACIA). Bolstered
by the CRE, UKACIA published a report in 1993 titled
"Muslims and the Law in Multi-Faith Britain: The Need for
Reform." Drawing upon the 1975 White Paper on racial dis-
crimination, the report called for comparative protection on
the basis of religion: "Where unfair discrimination is
involved, the necessity of legal remedies is now generally
accepted. To fail to provide a remedy against an injustice
strikes at the rule of law" (cited in Weller, 2006, p. 304).
Once again, a lack of evidence failed to convince politicians
and policy makers of such "an injustice." In trying to fill this
evidence gap, the CRE a year later conducted a survey of
4 SAGE Open
agencies that dealt with complaints of religious discrimina-
tion. As Weller (2006) notes, the findings were unconvincing
due to the low numbers of responses received. In the same
year, however, the Anti-Discrimination (Amendment) Act
1994 was introduced extending levels of protection afforded
to ethnic groups under the Race RelationsAct (RRA) 1976 to
monoethnic religious groups, namely, Jews and Sikhs. In
response, two leaflets emerged: one from the Inner Cities'
Religious Council's Challenging Religious Discrimination:
A Guide for Faith Communities and Their Advisers; the
other, the CRE's Religious Discrimination: Your Rights
(Weller, 2006, p. 305). Neither did the new legislation afford
protection to Muslims given their multiethnicity nor did the
leaflet refer to Islamophobia.
However, specific interest was being shown toward
Islamophobia. Via the Runnymede Trust, a report from the
Commission on Anti-Semitism noted how religious discrim-
ination was on the increase. Providing evidence to suggest
that levels of discrimination toward Jewish communities was
on the increase, the report added that the same was true of
Muslim communities also (Runnymede Commission on
Anti-Semitism, 1994). Although the report failed to substan-
tiate this with evidence, it did refer to it as Islamophobia.
From this, the CBMI was established and 3 years later, its
report, Islamophobia: A Challenge for Us All, was published
(CBMI, 1997). For Weller (2006), this "moved the terms of
the debate quite significantly," it "introduced into public dis-
course the notion that, alongside shared dynamics of dis-
criminatory experience, there may also be particularities of
Muslim experience signalled by the word `Islamophobia'"
(p. 306). Setting out 60 recommendations for national and
local government as well as the voluntary and private sec-
tors, the report sought "decisive action" across education,
employment, health, housing, and the media (CBMI, 1997,
p. iii). Although the report's definition and typology has
undoubtedly shaped understanding, its recommendations
were less impacting. Once more, the lack of clear evidence
failed to convince many, not just of the need to act against
Islamophobia but also of the phenomenon's very reality
(Allen, 2010).
Published soon after New Labour's 1997 electoral suc-
cess, this lack of political commitment became apparent at
the report's launch at the House of Commons. Launched by
the then Home Secretary (Jack Straw), Straw immediately
dismissed two major recommendations: equity for state-
funded, faith-based schools; and legislation to protect against
Islamophobia (Allen, 2010):
"[The Government] have immediate plans to legislate on racial
violence. I am sick to death of the mindless bigotry and thuggery
which damages and destroys the lives of so many people in this
country . . . It is a continuing shame to our society, and as a
society, we must not tolerate it." (Q News, November 1-20,
1997)
Despite the report seeking to establish Islamophobia as dis-
tinct, Straw instead conflated manifestations of Islamopho-
bia with those of "racial" violence. In failing to recognize
the necessary distinction between the two, the particularistic
nature of Islamophobia--one based on markers of Muslim-
or Islam-ness--seemed lost.
Things Can Only Get Better: New
Labour
New Labour, however, was more open to faith and religion
than its predecessor. For Gilliat-Ray (2004), Blair's language
of "social inclusion" went beyond material wealth and pov-
erty to incorporate citizenship and equality of opportunity.
The capacity for faith groups to provide voluntary services
also gave them economic viability (Gilliat-Ray, 2004). Other
drivers too were evident including the social deprivation of
some religious communities (Anwar & Bakhsh, 2003;
Woodhead, 2010), demographic changes necessitating the
establishment of nonhistorical religious traditions (Bruce,
1996; Davie, 1994), and an increasing number of people
choosing to identify themselves religiously (Oliver-Dee,
2009). For Harris, Halfpenny, and Rochester (2003), there
was also "the personal moral and Christian commitment of
several members of the government including the prime
minister" (p. 96). And, of course, there was the recognition
of growing anti-religious--anti-Muslim?--attitudes post-
9/11 (Allen, 2005; CBMI, 2004). McLoughlin (2003) and
Silvestri (2010) argue it was this that prompted New Labour's
unprecedented engagement with Muslim communities via
Muslim organizations. McLoughlin even suggests that the
Muslim Council of Britain was itself a creation of New
Labour for this very purpose.
In terms of tackling religious discrimination as opposed to
Islamophobia more specifically, New Labour oversaw two
developments soon after coming to government. The first
was the Human Rights Act (HRA) 1998. Although not
directly applicable to discrimination, it did constitutionally
establish the freedom to religion or belief. The second was
the commissioning of research into religious discrimination
in 1999. The report "Religious Discrimination in England
and Wales" (Weller, Feldman, & Purdam, 2001) found that a
majority of Muslim respondents believed that hostility and
abuse was on the increase. Overseen by Weller, he has since
written how this "involved walking something of a political
and publicity tightrope, suspended between community
expectations, scientific research methodologies, the political
context, the staff and perspectives of the Home Office's
Research, Development and Statistics Directorate" (2006, p.
308). At the time, some Muslims were unhappy with the
findings, critical for not being specific about Islamophobia
given their belief this was the most prevalent form of reli-
gious discrimination (Weller, 2006). Nonetheless,
Allen 5
recommendations for tackling religious discrimination
emerged including the extension of race relations legislation,
the HRA and the largely defunct blasphemy laws (Weller et
al., 2001). The creation of new laws--specific and generic--
was also posited and was afforded greater inquiry via the
HomeOffice2001report"TacklingReligiousDiscrimination:
Practical Implications for Policy-Makers and Legislators"
(Hepple & Choudhary, 2001).
In the background to these developments, the fallout from
9/11 was becoming evident. Government's focus shifted and
became fixed on security and the threat of Al-Qaeda inspired
terrorism. However, as research undertaken by the EUMC
highlighted, 9/11 also brought about an increase in anti-
Muslim incidents and hostility:
Muslims became indiscriminate victims of an upsurge of both
verbal and physical attacks following the events of 11 September.
From its findings, a new dynamism emanating directly from the
attacks on the US saw manifestations of anti-Muslim and anti-
Islamic expression become both more extreme and explicit, and
much more widely tolerated. (Allen & Nielsen, 2002, p. 43)
Soon after 9/11, New Labour's John Denham (2001) high-
lighted the government's fear of a real backlash, raising the
specter of a cancer-like "normative" Islamophobia spreading
through British society. However, Denham's statement was
anomalous. New Labour--whether advertently or inadver-
tently--repeatedly associated matters of security with reli-
gious discrimination at the same time as seemingly preferring
not to refer to a particularistic Islamophobia (Allen, 2011c).
Therefore, while government quickly introduced legislation
to protect those at risk from assault or abuse on the basis of
their religion, they did through the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and
Security Act 2001. Here, the law was expanded to afford
equitable protection against violence to religious communi-
ties, whether multi- or monoethnic, as for racial groups. Other
legislation was also introduced. The Criminal Justice Act
2003 extended sentencing provisions for offenses aggravated
by hostility toward victims because of their religion (as well
as sexual orientation or disability). The Racial and Religious
Hatred Act 2006 also made an offense of using threatening
words or behavior with the intention of stirring up hatred on
the basis of religion. This built upon the protection afforded
under the Public Order Act 1986.
While seeking to protect on the basis of religion, rarely
was Islamophobia specifically referenced. Neither was the
legislation overtly referred to in terms of protecting Muslims
or their communities. Where Muslims were referred to, how-
ever, was in the policy discourses linked to antiterror and
security. Whether seeking to curtail and control radicalism,
proscribe extremist groups, or introduce new offenses includ-
ing acts preparatory to or encouraging of terrorism and dis-
seminating terrorist publications, research shows how this
reinforced many of the public's fears and anxieties about
Muslims and Islam (Briggs, Fieschi, & Lownsbrough, 2006;
Khan, 2009). History may offer an interesting precedent.
Solomos (1989) and Ratcliffe (2004) write about the close
relationship between race relations legislation and immigra-
tion. For Ratcliffe, despite introducing the RRA 1968, the
Labour government of the time also needed to be seen to be
tough on immigration and so simultaneously introduced the
Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968. The same occurred
with the introduction of the RRA 1965 and the 1965 White
Paper on Commonwealth Immigrants. While recognizing
that religiously motivated discrimination (Islamophobia?)
was on the increase, it might also be that New Labour also
felt the need to be "tough" on security. Indeed, it could be
argued that the political situation dictated this rather more so
than any political ideology. Nonetheless, it is clear that
throughout this period, two quite disparate issues became
linked and that a particularistic Islamophobia seemed lost.
In the latter years of its government, New Labour oversaw
the extensive broadening of the equalities framework, includ-
ing extending protection against discrimination on the basis
of age, sexual orientation, and of course, religion or belief
and none. Described as a "radical change" by Riddell and
Watson (2011, p. 191), legislative protection on the basis of
religion or belief was first incorporated under the Equality
Act 2006 before being strengthened by the Equality Act
2010. Building on the European Employment Equality
(Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003, which extended pro-
tection across all forms of employment against discrimina-
tion, harassment, and victimization, the 2006 Act also
established the Equality and Human Rights Commission
(EHRC). As with Weller's research half a decade earlier,
some Muslims were again unhappy that Islamophobia was
seemingly negated and rarely mentioned by politicians or
policy makers.An example of this can be seen in the EHRC's
report "Religion or Belief: Identifying Issues and Priorities"
(Woodhead, 2010). While Islamophobia is referred to, the
report offers scant recognition of its prevalence or scale, per-
ceived or actual. This could be consequential once more of a
continued failure to necessarily evidence Islamophobia.
What impact, if indeed any, the paucity of acknowledg-
ment for Islamophobia under New Labour had is open to
question. As research published at the end of New Labour's
government highlights, society increasingly felt that Muslims
were likely to encounter prejudice on the basis of their reli-
gion (Botcherby, Glen, Iganski, Jochelson, & Lagou, 2011).
Eighty-three percent--from a representative cross section of
contemporary British society--believed that levels of preju-
dice were higher than 5 years previous. Public attitudes
toward Muslims and Islam had also changed. In the "2009-
2010 British SocialAttitudes Survey," not only were Muslims
the least popular religious community but more than half of
respondents also agreed they would be bothered by the build-
ing of a large mosque in their community. Only 15% felt the
same about a large church (National Centre for Social
Research, 2010). Such findings are not Islamophobic per se;
but they are indicative public attitudes becoming more
6 SAGE Open
negative. This deterioration was felt by Muslims themselves
with research showing they were most likely to fear attack
due to skin color, race, or religion (DCLG, 2011). Of those
Muslims who were victims, nearly half perceived this to be
incited because of their religion (DCLG, 2011). In addition,
despite the introduction of legislation to protect on the basis
of religion or belief, Muslims continued to feel they received
too little government protection (DCLG, 2011).
A Government That Does God: The
Coalition
As before, it is surprising the emphasis afforded by the
Coalition on the issue of Islamophobia since winning the
2010 election. Most notable has been its willingness to refer
to Islamophobia as a seemingly particularistic phenomenon.
Even more surprising is Riddell and Watson's (2011) view
that equality issues would unlikely be a priority for the
Coalition. Clearly not all the recent developments can be
solely attributed to the Coalition: the APPG was first called
for in March 2010 and so pre-dates the Conservative-Liberal
Democrat alliance. Launched months after the 2010 election
in November, the APPG had the remit to investigate the
forms, manifestations, and extent of discrimination against
Muslims in today's Britain; review the effectiveness of rele-
vant legislation; review existing mechanisms for recording
anti-Muslim hate crimes; and investigate the role of the media
in fostering intolerance toward Muslims (APPG, unpub-
lished). The APPG sought to replicate the successes of the
Anti-Semitism APPG. These included improving the report-
ing and recording ofAnti-Semitic incidents and attacks, mini-
mizing Anti-Semitic activity on university campuses, and
working toward greater international collaboration to tackle
Anti-Semitism online (APPG on Anti-Semitism, 2006).
The Islamophobia APPG was, however, dogged by con-
troversy soon after its launch. Following the appointment of
iENGAGE--a London-based Muslim organization--as the
Secretariat, a number of Parliamentarians publicly resigned
from the APPG, including the chair and vice-chair,
Conservative MP Kris Hopkins and Lord Janner of
Braunstone, respectively. The resignations were in response
to accusations in the media--including the influential
Conservative Home website--which suggested iENGAGE
and its associates were "Islamist sympathisers" (Allen,
2011a). What ensued was a series of highly polemical "tit-
for-tat" online articles from iENGAGE and their opponents.
Aside from the polemics, a number of commentators also
questioned whether iENGAGE had the necessary experience
or credibility for the role. A full narrative of unfolding events
can be found in the report "A Momentous Occasion" (Allen,
2011a) but after what has been described as an acrimonious
"trial by blog," the APPG's members voted to remove iEN-
GAGE as Secretariat in the autumn of 2011. Although wel-
comed by many, any focus on Islamophobia was "lost" in the
process and so set back the impetus that had been started
(Allen, 2011a). Since being relaunched in November 2011,
the APPG has achieved a tentative cross-party support and at
the time of writing, is devising a work program (Allen,
2011d).
Supporting the APPG, a CGWG was established in
January 2012 (Cross Party Working Group on Islamophobia
& Anti-Muslim Hate Crime, 2012a). In addition, and with
the proviso to collect concrete evidence, the Coalition is
financially backing the recently launched TELL MAMA
(measuring anti-Muslim attacks) project, a telephone and
online third-party reporting service where victims and wit-
nesses can record details about Islamophobic and anti-
Muslim incidents. The CGWG and TELL MAMA projects
have distinct similarities to initiatives that emerged out of the
Anti-Semitism APPG. Although too early to evaluate rela-
tive success or failure, the Coalition seems to have shifted
the policy direction for tackling Islamophobia, preferring to
align Islamophobia with Anti-Semitism more than with the
equalities framework. This can be seen in the backing of the
TELL MAMA project and its clear resonance with the
Community Safety Trust (CST), an equitable Jewish-run
organization which assists victims of Anti-Semitism at the
same time as monitoring attacks and incidents. The evidence
provided by the reporting of the CST is widely acknowl-
edged by the government, police, and media among others.
Comparing Approaches
Although developments are ongoing, there are some clear
differences between Coalition and New Labour approaches.
First, the Coalition seems much more comfortable in naming
Islamophobia and referring to it as distinct and particularis-
tic. Although a lack of definition remains apparent, those
such as Warsi have made bold and overt statements about
Islamophobia. So too does the Coalition seem more con-
vinced of the reality of the phenomenon albeit with the need
to evidence this. In addition, with that comes the subsequent
need to commit to tackling Islamophobia. In comparison,
New Labour appeared tentative, even reluctant, to overtly
refer to Islamophobia. On the few occasions it did, it was
seemingly as an aside or consequential. One might speculate
on the reasons for this. First, New Labour might not have had
a clear understanding or definition of what Islamophobia
was and so was reluctant to invest in either the term or con-
cept. However, the Coalition is no different in this respect
although they have taken initial steps to address this. Second,
New Labour could have been unconvinced of the evidence
for a particularistic Islamophobia. As per the EHRC, there
was a lack of evidence to substantiate the separation of
Islamophobia from other religiously based forms of discrim-
ination (Woodhead, 2010). Again, the same is true of the
Coalition. However, recently, it seems that the need for evi-
dence is being addressed through the APPG and CGWG.
Allen 7
In terms of definition and evidence, there is little differ-
ence between New Labour and the Coalition except in terms
of conception. For New Labour, Islamophobia was a phe-
nomenon incorporated within broader understandings of
equalities. As such, existing legislation was extended and
strengthened, in line with other forms of discrimination and
as part of its social inclusion agenda. Questions remain, how-
ever, because as the research has shown, a significant driver
for New Labour in its early years was the belief that
Islamophobia was on the rise (Allen, 2010, 2011b; Allen &
Nielsen, 2002). Why then did it not feature more particularly
in political and policy discourses? Indeed, as public attitudes
toward Muslims and Islam deteriorated over the New Labour
government, such an approach might be deemed to have
failed. For Daniels and Macdonald (2005), policy and legis-
lation do not in themselves change public attitudes: They
merely curb certain behaviors. Like Blakemore and Drake
(1996) stated, equalities policies "will not change the world"
adding, "they were never designed to . . . the policies were
designed to win majority consent rather than to force change"
(p.210). Maybe then, New Labour's equalities approach to
tackling Islamophobia failed to win "majority consent."
Under the Coalition, a clear shift away from aligning or
incorporating Islamophobia within equalities is evident.
More so, the Coalition's aligns it with Anti-Semitism. In this
way, Islamophobia--as Anti-Semitism beforehand--is seen
as rather more exceptional and extraordinary. Under the
Coalition, Islamophobia is seen to have distinct and differen-
tiable features and characteristics and is clearly particularis-
tic. Under New Labour, Islamophobia was quite different: It
was far more generalistic--ordinary and far from excep-
tional. Maybe the Coalition has drawn from the historical
roots of Islamophobia's emergence, first acknowledged in a
report into Anti-Semitism. Maybe also the Coalition has
acknowledged how far-right and neo-Nazi groups having
contemporarily adopted Islamophobia as the ideology of
choice, in preference of traditional anti-Jewish ideologies. A
few points require further consideration. The first is that the
protection afforded by the extended equalities framework
should not be discounted. In establishing an evidence base,
the disaggregation of the EHRC's monitoring data on the
basis of religion or belief could prove extremely useful.
Second, there is a need to recognize how, at times,
Islamophobia overlaps with other discriminatory phenomena
such as racism (Allen, 2010; Allen & Nielsen, 2002; CBMI,
1997; Sayyid, 2010). Understanding Islamophobia solely as
a distinct and different phenomenon might mean that its
more fluid edges are negated or overlooked, confusing the
extent and limits of the phenomenon. Maintaining the equali-
ties perspective at the same time as affording a greater par-
ticularistic discourse therefore has the potential to culminate
in a more complete approach to tackling Islamophobia
beginning to emerge.
The political discourses and settings of New Labour and
the Coalition also need to be considered. For New Labour, a
strong linkage between the discourses of tackling religiously
motivated prejudice, discrimination, and crimes with terror
and security was apparent. As Becker and Bryman (2004)
among others highlight, discourse is a recognized tool with
which politicians reiterate and reinforce policy and thinking.
This linking therefore had a potentially twofold impact. First,
it had the potential to further reinforce the public's fears and
anxieties about Muslims and Islamic. Second, it had the
potential to further place Muslims and their communities
under greater scrutiny and so bring about feelings of anger,
alienation, mistrust, and even increase the likelihood of radi-
calization (Khan, 2009). Set against a discursive backdrop of
those such as Jack Straw's suggestion that the wearing of the
niqab--full-face covering--presented a barrier to integra-
tion (Allen, 2010), John Reid's requesting Muslim families
look for "tell-tale" signs of extremism in their children (BBC
News, 2006), and the Department of Education requesting
universities to "spy" on students vulnerable to extremist ide-
ologies (BBC News, 2006) among others, the policy dis-
course of New Labour was not always differentiable from
some of the more explicit discourses emanating from the
populist far-right: the British National Party and English
Defence League (EDL). One might even question the extent
to which New Labour's discourses attributed greater legiti-
macy to the far-right especially given its unprecedented
growth during the three terms of New Labour government.
Future Policy Considerations for
Islamophobia
With the Coalition explicitly recognizing and using the term
Islamophobia, it might be suggested that it is a government
that is rather more "Islamophobia friendly." Given Warsi's
comments about Islamophobia having passed the "dinner
table test," maybe under the Coalition Islamophobia has now
passed the "political table test" also. In doing so, it would
seem that Islamophobia will remain on the political agenda
for the foreseeable future. With this in mind, it might be that
the same two problems that have dogged policy responses to
tackling Islamophobia continue to be relevant: namely, defi-
nition and evidence. With the APPG, CGWG, and TELL
MAMA projects having all identified the latter as being
important, it is hoped that some headway might be expected
in the not too distant future. As regards definition, the same
headway might be less forthcoming. Although a single, for-
mal definition is not an absolute requirement--there are
indeed many different and competing definitions and con-
ceptualizations of racism, for instance--such a definition
might provide a metaphorical safety net under Weller's
"tightrope" that the APPG, CGWG, and TELL MAMA proj-
ects will no doubt be forced to walk. However, maybe the
most pressing relates to Daniels and Macdonald's acknowl-
edgment that laws alone do not change attitudes.
Consequently, any legislation will need to be accompanied
by additional policy approaches that seek to address the
8 SAGE Open
social problems which are causal to and exacerbating of ten-
sions, prejudice, and by consequence, discrimination toward
Muslims also. Given that public attitudes toward Muslims
and Islam would seem to be becoming increasingly negative,
changing them--if indeed this is a task for government--
will present a very serious challenge. This challenge is fur-
ther compounded by the opposition that has been historically
shown toward policies that tackle discrimination and pro-
mote equality (Blakemore & Drake, 1996). The potential for
these challenges to have a neutralizing effect is therefore a
distinct possibility. Because of this, definition and evidence
will be crucially important in the need to explain in a clear
and grounded manner exactly what Islamophobia is, why it
is a problem, and why it needs to be tackled. Without defini-
tion or evidence, confusion and a lack of clarity will continue
to punctuate debates, discussions, and developments.
Undoubtedly, the way ahead for politicians and policy mak-
ers will remain fraught with obstacles and potential pitfalls
even if for the Coalition at least, Islamophobia has now
passed the dinner table test. Ensuring that Islamophobia
passes the political test--maintaining political (conversa-
tional) civility--may still be more difficult.
