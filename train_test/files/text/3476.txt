Introduction
Fetal programming by maternal malnutrition results in low
birth weight and reduction in nephron number1­3 increasing
the risk for adult development of cardiovascular and renal
diseases.4,5 Vikse et al.6 showed that in humans the low
birth weight increased in 70% the risk for end-stage kidney
failure in adults. Experiments have been demonstrated that
renal programming with nephron number reduction may
occur even when birth weight is normal.7,8 It is important
that the consequences of fetal programming are not limited
to the first generation and their effects may be prolonged to
subsequent generations.9 The nephron number reduction
and hypertension provoked by gestational protein restric-
tion may pass throughout for F1 and F2 generations in both
male and female programmed rats.10 The renal program-
ming has been studied in an extended number of animal
models and recently we showed that rats submitted to ges-
tational low protein diet presented 8% lower birth weight
and hypertension from the 10th week of life in parallel with
30% reduced nephron number.11,12 Also, studies in 16-week-
old offspring of maternal low-protein rats have shown that
renal sodium excretion was 50% lower and angiotensin II
receptors were strikingly reduced.11,12 Different animal
models and gestational diet regimes or insults may result in
distinct programming effects and also different compensa-
tive challenges to maintaining homeostasis from birth to
adult life. The renin­angiotensin system (RAS) has been

Abstract
Introduction: The present study investigates, in 23-day-old and adult male rats, the effect of severe food restriction
in utero on blood pressure (BP), and its association with nephron structure and function changes, angiotensin II (AT1R/
AT2R), glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptor expression.
Materials and methods: The daily food supply to pregnant rats was measured and one group (n=15) received normal
quantity of food (NF) while the other received 50% of that (FR50%) (n=15). Kidneys were processed to AT1R, AT2R,
MR, and GR immunolocalization and for western blotting analysis. The renal function was estimated by creatinine and
lithium clearances in 12-week-old offspring.
Results: By stereological analyses, FR50% offspring present a reduction of nephron numbers (35%) with unchanged
renal volume. Expression of AT1R and AT2R was significantly decreased in FR50% while the expression of GR and MR
increased in FR50%. We also verified a pronounced decrease in urinary sodium excretion accompanied by increased BP
in 12-week-old FR50% offspring.
Conclusion: The current data suggest that changes in renal function are conducive to excess sodium tubule reabsorp-
tion, and this might potentiate the programming of adult hypertension. It is plausible to arise in the current study an
association between decreasing natriuresis, reciprocal changes in renal AngII and steroid receptors with the hyperten-
sion development found in FR50% compared with age-matched NF offspring.

implicated in the major renal programming studies.13 The
more discussed mechanism involved in fetal programming
is the reduction in expression and/or activity of placental
11HSD-2 exposing fetus to high concentration of mater-
nal glucocorticoids.14,15 The action of maternal corticoster-
oids in mineralo- (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors
may have an impact on renal development.16,17 After birth,
the day-by-day adaptations of programmed rats to keep
water and salt homeostasis may involve changes in expres-
sion/localization of these receptors. Recently, Rosario et
al.18 have speculated that transplacental down-regulation of
nutrients flow; in particular, amino acid transporters may
be also evolved in fetal programming by gestational protein
restriction. The purpose of the present study was to deter-
mine whether maternal undernutrition during pregnancy
alters the kidney expression of angiotensin II (AT1R and
AT2R), MRs and GRs in 23-day-old and 12-week-old male
rats. Since we have verified in a protein restriction model
that the long-term changes in renal sodium tubule handling
are associated with arterial hypertension development, we
hypothesized that undernutrition hypertension may result
from decreased urinary sodium excretion in the offspring.
Thus, to comparatively analyze these two models, we stud-
ied the tubular sodium handling, evaluated by lithium clear-
ance, in conscious maternal undernourished rats compared
with their appropriate normal maternal food intake
controls.
Material and methods
Animals
The experiments were conducted on age-matched rats of
sibling-mated Wistar Hannover rats (0.250­0.300 kg) and
allowed free access to water and normal rat chow. The gen-
eral guidelines established by the Brazilian College of
Animal Experimentation (COBEA) were followed through-
out the investigation. Our local colonies originated from a
breeding stock supplied by CEMIB/Unicamp, Campinas,
SP, Brazil. Immediately after weaning at 3 weeks of age,
animals were maintained under controlled temperatures
(25°C) and lighting conditions (7:00­19:00), with free
access to tap water and standard rodent laboratory chow
(Nuvital, Curitiba, PR, Brazil) and followed up to 12 weeks
of age. Animals were then mated and the day that sperm
were seen in the vaginal smear was designated as day 1 of
pregnancy. The dams were divided into two groups:
throughout the entire pregnancy, the daily food supply of
one group (FR50%) was restricted to 50% of the food con-
sumed by the other group (NF), and fed ad libitum. All
groups returned to the ad libitum standard rodent chow
intake after delivery. Body weight and food consumption
were determined every day (subsequently normalized for
body weight). The male pups from 15 FR50% and 15 NF
different litters were followed and maintained with normal
chow ad libitum until 23 days old and adulthood.
Blood pressure measurement
The systemic arterial pressure was measured in conscious
6-, 8-, 9-, 10-, 11- and 12-week-old rats by an indirect tail-
cuff method using an electrosphygmomanometer (Narco
Bio-Systems, Austin, TX) combined with a pneumatic
pulse transducer/amplifier. This indirect approach allowed
repeated measurements with a close correlation (correla-
tion coefficient = 0.975) compared with direct intra-arterial
recording. The mean of three consecutive readings repre-
sented the blood pressure.
Morphometric measurements and
stereological estimation of kidney volume,
glomerular number and glomerular volume
At postnatal Day 23, rats were anesthetized with a mixture
of ketamine (75 mg.kg-1 body weight, i.p.) and xylasine (10
mg.kg-1 body weight, i.p.) and the kidneys were removed
and weighed. Left kidneys were weighted and the volume
was estimated by Cavalieri's principle. Then, they were lon-
gitudinally divided into two halves and 4 mm slices were
weighted. The slices were placed in 10% formalin for ste-
reological estimation of total nephron number. Total body
weight and the weights of kidneys were determined and NF
(n=5) and FR50% (n=7) obtained from different litters.
Tissue blocks were exhaustively sectioned at 5 µm and then
stained with hematoxilin-eosin. We used the "fractionators"
method to estimate the number of glomeruli and estimated
the total number of renal corpuscles per kidney considering
the analyzed fraction of the kidney corrected to the entire
organ as described by Mandarim-de-Lacerda.19
Renal function tests
The renal function tests were performed on the last day at
12 weeks of age in unanesthetized, unrestrained NF (n =
15) and RF50% (n = 11) male rats. Creatinine and lithium
clearance were performed as standard methodology.12,20
Calculations and biochemical analysis
Plasma and urinary sodium, potassium, and lithium concen-
trations were measured by flame photometry (B262;
Micronal, São Paulo, Brazil). Creatinine was determined
spectrophotometrically (362; Micronal, São Paulo, Brazil)
by the alkaline picrate method. The results are reported as
means ± SD per 100 g body weight. Renal clearance was
calculated by a standard formula (C = UV/P) using the
plasma creatinine and lithium levels for each period.
CCr
was used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate and
CLi+
was used to assess proximal tubule output. FENa+
and
FEK+
were calculated as CNa+
/CCr
and CK+
/CCr
, respectively.
FEPNa+
(fractional proximal sodium excretion) and FEPPNa+
(fractional post-proximal sodium excretion) were calculated
as CLi+
/CCr
× 100 and CNa+
/CLi+
× 100, respectively.11,20,21

Tissue extracts
Twenty-three-day-old and 12-week-old male rats from the
NF (n=5) and FR50% (n=5) groups were used. The rats
were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (75 mg.kg-1
body weight, i.p.) and xylasine (10 mg.kg-1 body weight,
i.p.) and the animal's abdominal cavity was opened to kid-
ney removal. The tissue was minced coarsely and homog-
enized immediately in 10 volumes of solubilization buffer
(10 mL/L Triton-X 100, 100 mM Tris[hydroxymethyl]
amino-methane (Tris) pH 7.4, 10 mM sodium pyrophos-
phate, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM ethylenediamine-
tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 10 mM sodium vanadate, 2 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PSMF) and 0.1 mg/mL
aprotinin at 4ºC, using a polytron PTA 20S generator
(model PT 10/35, Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY,
USA) operated at maximum speed for 20 s. The tissue
extracts were centrifuged at 11.000 rpm at 4°C for 40 min,
and the supernatants used as samples.
Tissue processing, histology, and
immunohistochemical procedures
Twenty-three-day-old and 12-week-old male rats from the
NF (n=5) and RF50% (n=5) groups were anesthetized with a
mixture of ketamine (75 mg.kg-1 body weight, i.p.) and xyla-
sine (10 mg.kg-1 body weight, i.p.) and the level of anesthe-
sia was controlled by monitoring the corneal reflex. The
animals were then perfused with saline containing heparin
(5%) for 15 min under constant pressure, followed by perfu-
sion with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 4%
(w/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.1 M sucrose for 25 min. After
perfusion, kidneys were removed, weighted, and representa-
tive samples were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered formalin
during 24 h for paraffin embedding. For immunohistochemi-
cal analysis we used anti-AT1R, AT2R, MCR, and GR anti-
bodies (Santa Cruz Biotech, Inc., CA, USA). Antigen
retrieval was performed using 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0)
boiling in a microwave oven (1,300 W) twice for 5 min each.
Proteins were immunohistochemically detected using the
avidin­biotin­peroxidase method. Briefly, deparaffinized
5-m-thick heart sections on poly-l-lysine coated slides were
treated with 3% H2
O2
in phosphate-buffered saline for 15
min, non-fat milk for 60 min, primary antibodies for 60 min,
and avidin­biotin­peroxidase solution (Vector Laboratories
Inc, CA, USA, 1:1:50 dilution). Chromogenic color was
accomplished with 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochlo-
ride (DAB, Sigma­Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) as the
substrate to demonstrate the sites of peroxidase binding. The
slides were counterstained with Harris's hematoxylin. Five
cortical and five medullar fields of each histological section
(n=3 for each group) were analyzed and the average of the
readings determined the immunoreactivity. Images were
captured with photomicroscope and analyzed by the Leica
Qwin 3.1 for windows.
Antibodies and chemicals
Protein quantification was performed using the Bradford
method. For quantification, both tissue and total extract
samples (250 µg protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE.
After electrophoretic separation, proteins were transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes and then blotted with specific
antibody. The samples were treated with Laemmli buffer
containing 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), heated in a boiling
water bath for 4 min and subjected to 8% sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in
a Bio-Rad minigel apparatus (Mini-Protean, Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA). Electrotransfer of proteins from the
gel to the nitrocellulose membranes was performed for 90
min at 120 V (constant) in a Bio-Rad miniature transfer
apparatus (Mini-Protean). The non-specific protein binding
to the nitrocellulose was reduced by preincubating the filter
for 2 h at 22°C in blocking buffer (5% non-fat dry milk, 10
mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.02% Tween 20). The nitro-
cellulose blots were incubated at 4°C overnight with pri-
mary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer (3% non-fat dry
milk, 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.02% Tween 20).

Immunoreactive bands were detected using the enhanced
chemiluminescence method (RPN 2108 ECL western blot-
ting analysis system; Amersham Biosciences) and were
detected by autoradiography using preflashed Kodak XAR
film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA) with Cronex
Lightning Plus intensifying screen (DuPont, Wilmington,
DE, USA) for 10 min. Images of the developed radiographs
were scanned (Epson Stylus 3500) and band intensities were
quantified by optical densitometry (Scion Image
Corporation).
Statistical analysis
All data were reported as means ± EPM. Comparisons
involving only two means within or between groups were
performed using Student's t-test. A p-value < 0.05 was con-
sidered to indicate significance.
Results
FR50% male offspring presented significant reduction in
birth body weight (5.67 ± 0.16 g vs. 6.84 ± 0.13 g in NF,
p<0.001) (Figure 1). Systolic blood pressure increased
(Figure 2) from sixth to 12th week (sixth, 149.1 ± 3.4
mmHg vs. 125.1 ± 3.2 mmHg in NF, p<0.001; 12th, 164.4
± 4.9 mmHg vs. 144 ± 3.3 mmHg in NF, p=0.02).
By stereological analyses we verified that FR50% off-
spring present a significant reduction of nephron numbers
per kidney (about 35% less: 22 450±1497 units vs. 34
630±3560 units in NF, p=0.0055, Figure 3) with unchanged
cortical (461 000±24 240 vs. 452 000±51 630 in NF, p=0.88)
and glomerular volume (1760±0.22 L vs. 1038±0.14 L in
NF, p=0.03) when compared with NF group.
Renal function data
The data for renal function in the 12-week-old male off-
spring of both (NF and FR50%) groups are summarized in
Figure 4. The urinary flow rates and the glomerular filtra-
tion rates, estimated by CCr
, did not significantly differ
among the groups during the renal tubule sodium handling
studies (147±40 L/min/100 g b.w. vs. 136±27 L/min/100
g b.w. in NF, p=0.39). Fractional urinary sodium excretion
(FENa
+) was significantly lower in FR50% rats when com-
pared with the NF age-matched group, as follows:
0.2±0.07% vs. 0.6±0.4% in NF, p=0.03). The decreased
FENa
+ in RF50% rats was accompanied by unchanged prox-
imal sodium excretion (FEPNa
+: 34±11% vs. 44±23% in
NF) and fractional potassium excretion (FEK
+) compared
with the NF age-paired control group. This decreased FENa+
occurred in parallel with significant reduction in FEPPNa
+
(FR50%: 7±4% vs. 17±11% in NF; Figure 4).

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis in male offspring of NF and RF50%
rat kidney yielded a single band at the expected weight of
corresponding proteins. The MR expression in 23-day-old
and 12-week-old male rats was not statistically different
between NF and FR50% (23 days: 873.3 ± 22 vs. 642.6 ±
51.6 in NF; 12-week-old: 1151± 42 vs. 987.7 ± 70.2 in NF).

The expression of GR increased in FR50% but this rise was
significant only in 12-week-old rats (23 days: 507 ± 91.02
vs. 262.6 ± 56.16 in NF, p=0.15; 12-week-old: 444.6 ±
36.45 vs. 360 ± 78.15 in NF, p=0.0007), shown in Figure 5.
The expression of AT1R was reduced in FR50% being sig-
nificant only in 12-week-old rats (23-day-old: 702.1 ±
46.01 vs. 799.3 ± 18.44 in NF, p=0.19; 12-week-old: 590.8
± 27.09 vs. 770 ± 35.91 in NF, p=0.05) (Figure 5). AT2R
expression was significantly decreased in 23-day-old and
12-week-old rats from the FR50% group (23 days: 580± 23
vs. 786 ± 91 in NF, p=0.01; 12-week-old: 275 ± 95.5 vs.
678.7 ± 15 in NF, p=0.001) (Figure 5).
Immunohistochemical analysis
Although by western blot we have not found significant dif-
ferences in the expression of MR in 23-day-old rats, by
immunohistochemistry we verified significantly increased
immunoreactivity of this receptor in the basolateral mem-
brane of the cells of the proximal convoluted tubules in ani-
mals of the FR50% group (Figure 6). In 12-week-old male
rats we found increased cytosolic expression in glomerular
cells and in the parietal epithelium of Bowman's capsule
(Figure7(a) and (e)). This increase was also observed in the
nuclei and citosol of post-proximal segments of both cortex
(Figure 7(b) and (f)) and medulla (Figure 7(d) and (h)). In
the proximal segments the immunoreactivity was enhanced
in the brush border (Figure 7(c) and (g)). For GR expres-
sion we observed a significant difference in the immunore-
activity that is raised in the basolateral membrane of all
tubular segments, being more significant in post-proximal
segments in 23-day-old rats (Figure 8). In 12-week-old rats
only medullar significant enhance was observed (Figure 9).
We verified a significant reduction in AT1R expression
in 23-day-old rat kidneys of FR50% by immunohistochem-
istry. This reduction occurred in the apical surface of
tubules, in mesangium and macula dense cells (Figure 10).
In accordance with immunoblot results, the AT2R reactiv-
ity was also reduced in the FR50% group of 23-day-old rats
(Figure 11).
Discussion
Early-life events during rat kidney development may lead
to a long-term disorder in renal sodium and water handling

significantly altered. GR expression was enhanced but only in adult rats this difference was significant.The AT1R-reduced expression

that seems to be associated with arterial hypertension
development at adult age.11,12 Here, in a severe maternal
food-restricted model, we focus on adult hypertension as an
outcome, and its association with nephron numbers, kidney
dysfunction, and RAS and steroid receptor renal expres-
sion. The result obtained in the present study suggests that
the kidney is an organ in which there are permanent func-
tional and humoral changes that underlie the developing
hypertension. The low birth weight widely observed in fetal
programming models induced by maternal malnutrition
was confirmed in the current study, where we found a
decreased offspring birth weight of 17% in maternal severe
food intake restriction. We previously demonstrated that in
a gestational low protein (LP) diet model, the birth weight
reduced by nearly 8.5%; however, here this reduction was
much more accentuated. We also found in FR50% animals,
a graded and significant increase in blood pressure from the
sixth week of life while, in LP offspring, the enhanced
blood pressure was observed beyond the 12th week
of age.11,12

The current study also has demonstrated a reduction of
35% in the nephron number, against a 27% reduction in the
LP model.12,22 There is evidence that insult such as mater-
nal food restriction, alters the total number of nephrons and
also causes late-onset hypertension.23­25 In the current
study, despite a pronounced reduction of nephron number
(35%) we did not observe any significant difference
between FR50% and NF glomerular volume and glomeru-
lar filtration rate, estimated by CCr. Additionally, 12-week-
old male offspring from 50% food-restricted mothers
presented a pronounced decrease in fractional urinary
sodium excretion accompanied by intensive sodium
reabsorption in distal segments of the nephron in spite of
unchanged CCr and FEPNa+. In this study, the reduced
number of nephrons is not responsible, per se, for the ele-
vated time-dependent blood pressure response in FR50%
offspring, since we did not observe any difference between
FR50% and NP creatinine clearance. This is consistent with
the fact that permanent and severe reduction of nephron
units does not cause enhanced arterial blood pressure in the
adult rats.26 Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that
increased kidney sodium transport in FR50% offspring
occurs by maladaptive renal tubule development during the
ontogenetic period. We may speculate that intrarenal

interactive actions of AngII contribute to increased tubular
sodium reabsorption, including constriction of postglomer-
ular arterioles, which alter peritubular capillary dynamics
and renal medullary blood flow, combined with direct
action of AngII on tubular epithelial cell transport.
Surprisingly, in the current study, the expression of
AngII receptors (meanlyAT2) in both 23-day and 12-week-
old maternal food-restricted rats, compared with NF off-
spring was dramatically down-regulated, suggesting other
mechanisms of antinatriuresis in these animals. In the pre-
sent study, previously observed for us in the LP model
study,11,12 was found a higher AngII AT1/AT2 receptor
ratio expression in FR50% offspring when compared with
NF kidneys. Since both AT1 and AT2 receptors are
expressed in arteriolar and glomerular cells,27 these may
modulate the renal blood flow and glomerular filtration
rate27,28 increasing the fractional filtration rate, at least par-
tially responsible for enhanced sodium reabsorption in
proximal segments of the nephron in FR50% rats. Despite
decreased nephron numbers, the unchanged glomerular fil-
tration rate in FR50% offspring is caused, at least in part
by higher glomerular AT1/AT2 receptor expression ratio
(plus 110% in 16-week-old FR50% rats compared with
unchanged AT1/AT2 ratio in NF), presumably decreasing
the vasodilatation response in postglomerular arterioles.
These data support the notion that AngII predominantly

constricts the postglomerular arterioles.29,30 By the current
data, we cannot also rule out any specific changes of
hydraulic parameters involved in the glomerular ultrafil-
tration coefficient. In fact, it is also possible that indirect
physical mechanisms associated with overexcitability of
the sympathetic nervous system induced by the renin­
angiotensin system could underlie the decrease in renal
sodium excretion and, consequently, enhance arterial pres-
sure in FR50% offspring.
The involvement and local expression of all components
of the renin­angiotensin system during nephrogenesis have
been remarkably demonstrated by several studies.1,11,12,31
The perinatal treatment of rats with high doses of the AT1R
antagonist caused, in adult life, a striking reduction in the
nephron number associated with arterial hypertension.32
Here, in the FR50% offspring, we demonstrate a decreased
AT1R expression by immunoblot (minus 30%) and immu-
nohistochemistry in all nephron segments accompanied
with early and pronounced reduction of nephron units. On
the other hand, the type 2 angiotensin II receptors are
expressed at high levels in embryonic tissues, and decrease
rapidly after birth.33 These receptors antagonize many
physiological AT1R-mediated effects by inhibiting cell
growth, and by inducing apoptosis and vasodilatation.34

Figure 11.AT2R kidney expression by immunohistochemistry in NF (a and b) and FR50% (c and d) groups in 23-day-old rats.
The graph on the left represents a total kidney staining quantification in NF and FR50% offspring and on the right is cortical (NFC
and FR50%C) and medullar (NFM and FR50%M) quantification. ****p<0.0001. NF: normal quantity of food; FR50%: 50% of normal
quantity of food received.
In the current study, the renal expression ofAT2R presented
a striking decrease (about 25% to 23-day and 60% to
12-week-old offspring), which is consistent with a previous
report showing reduced renal AT2R mRNA in food-
restricted rats.11,12,23,35 We cannot rule out that the decreased
renalAngII receptor expression in the FR50% progeny may
be simply an adaptive downregulation response that limits
the fetal renal growth and post-natal sodium transport.
Conversely, the expression of the MRs and GRs in
23-day-old and adult FR50% kidneys was significantly
increased, when compared with the age-matched control
groups. The most well-defined physiological action of
mineralo- and glucocorticoid is the regulation of electrolyte
and volume balance through its renal action on the distal
tubule and cortical collecting duct. The amino acid
sequences of the MR and GR have a high degree of homol-
ogy. The identity is near 94% at the center of the molecule
in the DNA-binding domain and 55­60% in the C-terminal
ligand-binding domain. Most effects of mineralocorticoid
are mediated by a specific nuclear receptor, the MR.
Stimulation of MR in these cells results in sodium reab-
sorption and potassium excretion. This steroid binding to
its cognate receptor enhances the transcription of steroid-
inducible proteins and the synthesis of the subunits of the
Vaccari et al. 45
apical epithelial sodium channel and of the basolateral
Na/K-ATPase are increased.36,37 Moreover, the non-
genomic effects of mineralocorticoid, such as the methyla-
tion of the sodium channel, may contribute to the increased
steroid-mediated sodium reabsorption.37,38 It has been
observed that aldosterone and cortisol have similar binding
affinities for the MR in vitro.39 Circulating levels of cortisol
in humans and corticosterone in rodents are 2- to 3-fold
higher than aldosterone levels. However, in vivo, only
aldosterone acts as a physiologic agonist of the MR. This
apparent paradox was solved with the discovery of the
microsomal enzyme 11HSD.40­42 In mineralocorticoid tar-
get tissues, the type 2 isoenzyme converts the biologically
active 11-hydroxy-steroid to their inactive 11-keto-steroid
forms, thus conferring ligand specificity on the MR. In the
current study, the increased reabsorption of sodium in distal
portions of nephron may be associated with enhanced
expression of MR and GR in these sites and/or to decreased
tubule expression of 11HSD2 as demonstrated in other tis-
sues in food-restricted animals.43
Based on these comparisons, we may suppose that a
severe gestational reduction of all food nutrient and calo-
ries content accentuate the renal and cardiovascular disor-
ders in adult life, when compared with the maternal
protein-restricted intake group at the same period.
Moreover, the psychological stress caused by extreme food
restriction may also contribute to exacerbate the effects of
concomitant nutritional stress. Although the precise mecha-
nism responsible for the subsequently enhanced sodium
retention response in 12-week-old FR50% offspring is not
completely known, the current data suggest that changes in
renal function are conducive to excess sodium tubule reab-
sorption that is associated with presumable higher AngII
AT1/AT2 receptor ratio expression in peripheral vessels,
which might potentiate the programming of adult
hypertension.
Conclusion
In fact, it is plausible to deduce in the current study an asso-
ciation between decreased natriuresis, reciprocal changes
in renal AngII and steroid receptors with the hypertension
development found in severe food-restricted offspring
when compared with age-matched NF rats. In conclusion,
we suppose that, under extreme food restriction, the fetus
responds with adaptations accommodating to intrauterine
conditions. After birth, the overload for an economical kid-
ney version may result in decreased urinary sodium excre-
tion and increased blood pressure. This overload can result
in premature nephron senescence in parallel with functional
loss.
