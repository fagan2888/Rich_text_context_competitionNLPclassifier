Effects of Positive and Negative Social Exchanges
With Various Sources on Depressive Symptoms
inYounger and Older Adults
Morris A. Okun and Verna M. Keith
Arizona State University.
Addressing a previous gap in the gerontological literature, the present study examined the effects of both positive and nega-
tive social exchanges within key relationships (spouse, children, and other relatives/friends) on the depressive symptoms of
younger (28 to 59 years old) and older (60 to 92 years old) men and women. Separate analyses were carried out on younger
adults (N = 452) and older adults (N = 849) who were respondents in the Americans' Changing Lives study. In both age
groups, positive and negative social exchanges with the same source were significantly (p < .001), inversely related (rs
rangefrom -.23 to -.43); and positive social exchanges exerted stronger net effects on depressive symptoms than negative
social exchanges. For older adults, some buffering effects werefound when negative andpositive social exchanges were as-
sociated with different sources; for younger adults, buffering effects were found when negative and positive social ex-
changes were associated with the same source. These buffering effects were not conditioned by gender. The findings of the
present study highlight the importance of taking into account the age of the recipient and the provider-recipient relation-
ship when studying thejoint influence of negative andpositive social exchanges on adults'depressive symptoms.
SINCE Rook (1984) demonstrated that social relationships
can adversely influence the psychological well-being of
older adults, several investigators have examined the effects of
both positive and negative social ties in later life (e.g., Finch,
Okun, Barrera, Zautra, & Reich, 1989; Fiore, Becker, &
Coppel, 1983; Vinokur & Vinokur-Kaplan, 1990). In reviews
of this research, Rook (1990, 1994) concluded that (a) negative
and positive social exchanges are unrelated to each other, and
(b) the detrimental effects of negative social exchanges are
more potent than the beneficial effects of positive social ex-
changes. Krause (1995) called for additional research on this
topic because he postulated that elderly people were especially
likely to be adversely affected by negative social interaction.
Previous gerontological research on the effects of both pos-
itive and negative social exchanges has suffered from several
limitations. First, these studies have tended to focus
on older adults facing major stressors and have used small,
nonrepresentative samples (Okun, Melichar, & Hill, 1990;
Stephens, Kinney, Norris, & Ritchie, 1987). In the present
study, we analyzed data collected from a national probability
sample. Second, the effects of various sources of positive and
negative social exchanges on depressive symptoms were not
addressed in these studies. There is a growing consensus in
the literature on social ties and depression that it is important
to consider characteristics of the provider (Barrera, Chassin,
& Rogosch, 1993; Krause & Jay, 1991). In the present study,
we were able to take into account three different sources of
support (spouse, children, and other relatives/friends).
Third, few gerontological studies of the effects of both pos-
itive and negative social exchanges have investigated the pos-
sibility that these variables exert joint effects on depressive
symptoms (Pagel, Erdly, & Becker, 1987; Rook, 1984).
Moreover, gerontological studies investigating interaction ef-
fects have not distinguished among the various sources of
support. In the present study, we were able to test for interac-
tion effects between positive and negative social exchanges
when the source was the same (e.g., positive and negative so-
cial exchanges with spouse) and when the sources were dif-
ferent (e.g., positive social exchanges with spouse and nega-
tive social exchanges with children). Fourth, gerontological
studies of both positive and negative social exchanges have
not explored whether the effects of these variables are condi-
tioned by gender and age. Because adults' social networks
have been shown to vary by gender (Antonucci & Akiyama,
1987a) and by age (Antonucci & Akiyama, 1987b), in the
present study we investigated gender differences in the joint
effects of positive and negative social exchanges and disag-
gregated our analyses by age.
The purpose of the present study was to address four re-
search questions: (1) What is the relation between positive and
negative exchanges for each source among younger and older
adults? (2) What are the relative contributions of positive and
negative social exchanges to predicting depressive symptoms
among younger and older adults? (3) Do positive social ex-
changes buffer the effects of negative social exchanges among
younger and older adults? and (4) Does gender moderate the
joint effects of positive and negative social exchanges on the
depressive symptoms of younger and older adults?
Our literature review is divided into five sections. In the first
section, we define social support and negative social exchanges.
Second, we summarize the relation between positive and nega-
tive social exchanges. Third, we review studies that have investi-
gated the additive effects of positive and negative social ex-
changes on depressive symptoms. In the fourth section, research
on interaction effects between positive and negative social ex-
changes is considered. Finally, we discuss how gender may in-
fluence the joint effects of positive and negative social ex-
changes with various sources on depressive symptoms.

Definitions of Positive and Negative Social Exchanges
Over the past two decades, researchers have found it useful
to distinguish among three aspects of social relationships
(Rook, 1994). One aspect, social embeddedness, focuses on
the extensiveness or structure of the individual's support net-
work. A second aspect emphasizes the relational content of
social exchanges, both positive and negative. Positive social
exchanges include various types of enacted support such as
aid, affect, and affirmation (Kahn & Antonucci, 1980), com-
panionship, and "positive" social control. Negative social ex-
changes include interference/demands, insensitivity, criti-
cism/ridicule, and hostility/impatience (Ruehlman & Karoly,
1991) as well as "negative" social control. The third aspect,
perceived support, refers to perceptions of the availability of
support and satisfaction with the network.
Relation Between Positive and Negative Social Exchanges
The dual focus on. positive and negative social exchanges
rests on the assumption that they are not strongly related to
each other. Otherwise, it is not possible to investigate the addi-
tive and joint effects of positive and negative social exchanges.
The prevailing view among researchers who study social ties
is that positive and negative social exchanges are unrelated
(Rook, 1990). On the one hand, several factor analyses pro-
vide support for this view (Finch et al., 1989; Pagel et al.,
1987; Sandier & Barrera, 1984). In these analyses, however,
positive and negative social exchange scores were not com-
puted for specific sources. On the other hand, a different con-
clusion can be drawn from the results of Vinokur and van
Ryn's (1993) factor analysis. They examined enacted support
from, and negative social exchanges with, spouse (or signifi-
cant other) among unemployed adults. Although Vinokur and
van Ryn (1993) found evidence to support a two-factor model,
the correlation between positive and negative social exchanges
was over -.70. Thus, it is possible that the magnitude of the re-
lation between positive and negative social exchanges depends
on whether the measures are source-specific.
To examine this possibility, we created a table for 59 arti-
cles published between 1978 and 1996 inclusive, which pro-
vides information about: (a) the age and type of sample, (b)
the source-specificity of the exchange measures, (c) whether
gender and age were used as moderator variables, (d) the rela-
tion between exchange measures, (e) additive effects of ex-
change measures on depressive symptoms, and (f) interaction
effects of negative and positive social exchanges on depres-
sive symptoms. The entries in the table were organized by the
age composition of the sample (Table 1).
We classified the relation between positive and negative so-
cial exchanges as: (a) strong, if measures shared at least 25%
of the variance; (b) moderate, if measures shared 4-24% of
the variance; and (c) weak, if measures shared less than 4% of
the variance. We ended up with 53 observations because 15
studies did not yield any estimates and 9 studies yielded two
estimates due to multiple measures, samples, or designs.
Fifty-five percent of the observations were weak, 30%
were moderate, and 15% were strong. The majority of the ob-
servations were derived from nonsource-specific measures
(58%). Interestingly, six of the eight strong inverse relations
were associated with measures targeted at specific types of
providers. When we classified the observations by age com-
position of the sample, we found that 75% of the strong in-
verse observations were associated with the mean age of 30-
49 years old. Our first research question addresses the issue of
whether in the younger and older adult samples there are in-
verse relations between positive and negative social ex-
changes when the type of provider is the same (e.g., positive
and negative social exchanges with other relatives/friends).
Additive Effects of Positive and Negative Social Exchanges
One pathway by which positive and negative social ex-
changes may influence emotional health is by exerting a di-
rect effect. According to the direct or additive effects model,
as positive social exchanges increase and as negative social
exchanges decrease, emotional health increases (Antonucci,
Sherman, & Akiyama, 1996). With respect to the additive ef-
fects of positive and negative social exchanges on depressive
symptoms, we classified the results of the studies listed in
Table 1 in terms of whether (a) the variables exerted equal ef-
fects, (b) positive social exchanges exerted larger effects than
negative social exchanges, or (c) negative social exchanges
exerted larger effects than positive social exchanges. The re-
sults of studies were coded based upon a subjective judgment
of the relative magnitude of the regression coefficients or cor-
relation coefficients for positive and negative social ex-
changes. We ended up with 63 observations because 8 studies
did not yield any estimates and 12 studies yielded two esti-
mates due to multiple measures, samples, or designs.
The prevailing view among researchers who study social
ties is that negative social exchanges are more potent than
positive social exchanges (Hobfoll & Stephens, 1990). In con-
trast, Ingersoll-Dayton, Morgan, and Antonucci (1997) re-
cently found in a nationally representative sample of adults 50
years of age and older that positive social exchanges exert an
effect on positive affect that is comparable to the magnitude
of the effect of negative social exchanges on negative affect.
From Table 1, we calculated that 41% of our observations
supported the view that negative, as opposed to positive, ex-
changes were more potent predictors of depressive symp-
toms. However, another 38% of the observations supported
an equal-effects interpretation, and 21% of the observations
supported the view that positive social exchanges are more
potent predictors of depressive symptoms than negative social
exchanges. When we disaggregated the observations by the
age composition of the sample, we found that for 88% of the
observations associated with older adult samples, negative so-
cial exchanges were more potent than positive social ex-
changes. Thus, our second research question addresses the
issue of whether negative and positive social exchanges exert
comparable net effects in younger and older adult samples.
Interaction Effects Between Negative and Positive Social
Exchanges
A second pathway by which positive and negative social
exchanges may influence emotional health is by exerting an
interaction effect. According to the buffering effects model,
social support cushions the adverse effect of stressors on
emotional health (Antonucci et al., 1996). Researchers ex-
ploring the joint effects of negative and positive social
typically have conceptualized negative social exchanges as a
type of stressor (Lepore, 1992) and have examined whether

their effect on depressive symptoms is buffered by positive
social exchanges.
As illustrated in Table 1, we located 11 studies that examine
interaction effects between negative and positive social ex-
changes. Some studies have not found any evidence of stress
buffering (Davis, Brickman, & Baker, 1991; Rhodes, Ebert, &
Fischer, 1992). Similarly, in a study of older widows, Rook
(1984) did not observe a significant interaction between prob-
lematic social interaction and social support. In the other study
that investigated the joint effects of positive and negative social
exchanges among older adults, Pagel et al. (1987) reported that
the interaction effect approached statistical significance. Using
measures of "upset" and "helpfulness," which were aggregated
across providers, they observed that upsetting behaviors were
more predictive of spousal caregivers' depressive symptoms as
the helpfulness of the network increased. Rook (1990) inter-
preted this "reverse" buffering interaction effect as indicating
that negative social interactions are especially salient when the
source is someone providing frequent support.
In two studies using nonsource-specific measures, social
support has been found to buffer negative social exchanges.
Revenson, Schiaffino, Majerovitz, and Gibofsky (1991) found
that positive support dampened the positive relation between
problematic support and depressive symptoms among rheu-
matoid arthritis patients. Rhodes and Woods (1995) observed
that the adverse effect of social strain on depressive symp-
toms among pregnant minority adolescents was cushioned by
cognitive guidance support.
In the remaining four studies which reported significant inter-
action effects, source-specific measures of negative and positive
social exchanges were used. Abbey, Abramis, and Caplan
(1985) examined whether positive and negative social ex-
changes had joint effects on depressive symptoms for "some
one person" and for "people in general." A buffering effect was
found for "some one person" but not for "people in general."
Schuster, Kessler, and Aseltine (1990) observed buffering effects
for men and women when the source was a relative but not
when the source was either a spouse or a friend. Barrera et al.
(1993) examined interaction effects for four sources of social
exchanges (mother, father, closest sibling, and best same-sex
friend) among adolescents with and without alcoholic fathers.
Two interaction effects were observed when closest sibling was
the source. For respondents with an alcoholic father, a support-
neutralization effect was found; conflict undermined the benefi-
cial effect of social support on self-esteem. For respondents with
nonalcoholic fathers, a support-amplification effect was found;
conflict enhanced the beneficial effect of social support on self-
esteem. Note that in all three of these studies, interaction effects
were examined only for the same source. For instance, in the
Barrera et al. study (1993), whereas the support from closest sib-
ling by conflict with closest sibling interaction effect was tested,
the researchers did not test the support from closest sibling by
conflict with mother interaction effect.
In the most thorough study done to date, Lepore (1992) con-
ducted a longitudinal study of support and conflict from room-
mates and friends (two distinct sources). This was the only study
we identified that examined buffering effects both from the
same source as well as from different sources. Four interaction
effects were tested (roommates negative-roommates positive;
roommates negative-friends positive; friends negative-room-
POSITIVEAND NEGATIVE SOCIAL EXCHANGES Pll
mates positive; and friends negative-friends positive). Evidence
for buffering effects was obtained only for the interaction effects
involving different sources (roommates negative-friends posi-
tive and friends negative-roommates positive).
Lepore's (1992) interpretation of this effect was that when
interpersonal stressors arise in one sector of a social network,
the most effective support is likely to emanate from other sec-
tors of the social network. In the face of interpersonal stres-
sors, individuals may turn to others for advice, a sympathetic
ear, and pleasant experiences. In the present study, our third
research question addresses whether negative and positive so-
cial exchanges with certain combinations of sources produce
buffering effects. More specifically, we investigate in our
younger and older adult samples whether: (a) negative social
exchanges with spouse are buffered by positive social interac-
tion with children, other relatives/friends, and spouse; (b) neg-
ative social exchanges with children are buffered by positive
social interaction with other relatives/friends, spouse, and
children; and (c) negative social exchanges with other rela-
tives/friends are buffered by positive social interaction with
children, spouse, and other relatives/friends.
Gender as a Moderator of Buffering Effects
Relative to men, women have larger social networks, re-
ceive more support, and provide more support (Antonucci &
Akiyama, 1987a). Whereas men receive more support than
women from spouses (Schuster et al., 1990), women receive
more support than men from friends and other relatives
(Lepore, 1992; Schuster et al., 1990). Research on gender dif-
ferences in the effects of social support on psychological dis-
tress suggests that different sources vary in their impact on
men and women. On the one hand, spouses seem to be more
important sources of support for men than women (Belle,
1987). On the other hand, other family members and friends
appear to contribute more to the emotional well-being of
women than men (Gore & Colten, 1991). However, these
gender differences in the effects of various sources of support
on psychological distress have not always been observed (see
Dean, Kolody, & Wood, 1990; Matt & Dean, 1993).
As shown in Table 1, six studies investigated whether there
were gender differences in the impact of positive social ex-
changes on emotional health. In the only study of older
adults, positive social exchanges exerted a comparable influ-
ence on the emotional health of women and men (Turner,
1994). In three other studies, gender did not moderate the re-
lation between positive social exchanges and emotional health
(Henderson, Bryne, Duncan-Jones, Scott, & Adcock, 1980;
Lepore, 1992; Vinokur, Price, & Caplan, 1996). In the re-
maining two studies, positive social exchanges had a greater
effect on the emotional health of women than men (Schuster
et al., 1990; Abbey, Andrews, & Halman, 1995).
We located seven studies that examined whether gender mod-
erated the effects of negative social exchanges on emotional
health. Negative social exchanges exerted comparable effects on
the emotional health of older women and older men (Turner,
1994). In three other studies, no evidence of gender by negative
social exchange interaction effects were observed (Lepore,
1992; Semple, 1992; Vinokur et al., 1996). In two of the remain-
ing three studies, women were affected more than men by nega-
tive social exchanges (Henderson et al., 1980; Schuster et al.,
1990). In contrast, Abbey et al. (1995) observed that men were
more affected than women by negative social exchanges.
Gender differences in the influence of negative social ex-
changes may depend on the source (Rook, 1994). Bolger,
DeLongis, Kessler, and Schilling (1989) found that women
were more adversely affected than men by negative social
exchanges with their spouses, but Schuster et al. (1990)
found that women and men were equally affected by nega-
tive social exchanges with their spouses. Negative social ex-
changes with relatives appear to exert a greater influence on
the depressive symptoms of women as compared to men
(Schuster et al., 1990).
If social exchanges with different sources vary in their im-
pact on the psychological distress of men and women (with
men being more affected than women by the spousal relation-
ship and women being more affected than men by relation-
ships with other family members and friends), then the joint
effect of positive and negative social exchanges may be con-
ditioned by gender. Our fourth research question addresses
the issue of whether gender interacts with negative and posi-
tive social exchanges with various sources to influence de-
pressive symptoms in younger and older adults.
METHOD
Sample
The data for this study are taken from the first wave of the
Americans' Changing Lives (ACL) Survey. The data were col-
lected in 1986 using face-to-face interviews of a national proba-
bility sample. A total of 3,617 respondents residing in the conti-
nental United States were interviewed. Blacks and persons over
the age of 60 were sampled at twice the rate of Whites and peo-
ple between the ages of 40 and 59. Thus, the sample was
weighted according to the following sample selection ratios: (a)
White men younger than 60 = 1; (b) White women younger
than 60 = 1; (c) White men 60 and over = 2; (d) White women
60 and older = 2; (e) Black men younger than 60 = 2; (f) Black
women younger than 60 = 2; (g) Black men 60 and over = 4;
and (h) Black women 60 and over = 4. The overall response rate
for this survey was 67%. The interviews lasted an average of 86
minutes. For the analyses presented within this article, the sam-
ple was divided into two age groups (younger adults = younger
than 60 years old; older adults = 60 years old and older) and
then weighted to take into account the oversampling for Blacks.
To be included in the present analyses, survey participants
had to meet four criteria: (a) have a living spouse; (b) have at
least one child aged 16 or over residing outside the home; (c)
have at least one other relative or friend; and (d) have no
missing data on any of the study variables. These criteria
were met by 452 younger adults (age range = 28 to 59 years
old) and 849 older adults (age range = 60 to 92 years old).
We decided to disaggregate our sample by age rather than
examine age as a moderator variable because the latter ap-
proach potentially could have resulted in significant fourth-
order interaction effects (positive social exchanges by nega-
tive social exchanges by gender by age) which would have
been difficult to interpret. In addition, we did not pursue race
differences in the effects of positive and negative social ex-
changes because, after weighting within age groups, there
were less than 45 Black men and women within each age
P12 OKUNAND KEITH
group. We also considered weighting within racial groups in-
stead of age groups. However, this approach still resulted in
less than 50 Black men and women 60 and over.
Measures
Information on the central tendency and variability of the
measures for each age group is provided in Table 2.
Depressive symptoms. -- During the ACL interview, respon-
dents were asked 11 of the 20 items that comprise the Center for
Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale CES-D (Radloff,
1977). These items were: (1) felt depressed, (2) everything was
an effort, (3) sleep restless, (4) happy (reverse coded), (5) lonely,
(6) people were unfriendly, (7) enjoyed life (reverse coded), (8)
appetite was poor, (9) felt sad, (10) felt people disliked me, and
(11) could not get going. Respondents were asked to indicate
how often during the past week they had experienced the symp-
toms on a 3-point, rather than a 4-point, scale. The response op-
tions were: 1 = hardly ever; 2 = some of the time; 3 = most of
the time. Scores were summed over the 11 items with higher
scores indicating more depressive symptoms. The 11-item ver-
sion of the CES-D has been shown to correlate .95 with the
unabridged version of the scale (see Umberson, Wortman, &
Kessler, 1992). In the present study, the internal consistency reli-
ability estimate of the 11-item version of the CES-D scale was
.83 for younger adults and .77 for older adults.
Positive and negative social exchanges. -- Positive social
exchanges were measured using two items that ask respon-
dents to indicate how much each of three sources (1) makes
them feel loved and cared for and (2) is willing to listen when
they need to talk about their worries or problems. These items
tap the affect and affirmation dimensions of enacted social
support. Negative social exchanges were measured using two
items that ask respondents to indicate how often each of three
sources (1) makes too many demands and (2) is critical of
them or what they do. These items tap the interference/

demands and criticism/ridicule dimensions of negative social
exchanges. Responses to each social exchange item were
coded according to a 5-point scale (1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3
= some, 4 = quite a bit, and 5 = a great deal).
The three sources of positive and negative social ex-
changes were spouse, children, and other relatives/friends.
Respondents were not asked to identify a particular individal
when the source was children or other relatives/friends. Thus,
when the source was one's spouse, the social exchange items
referred to a single provider, whereas when the source was ei-
ther one's children or one's other relatives/friends, the social
exchange items may have referred to multiple providers.
A total of six scores were derived from the social exchange
items: positive social exchanges with spouse (SPSE), positive
social exchanges with children (CPSE), positive social ex-
changes with other relatives/friends (OPSE), negative social ex-
changes with spouse (SNSE), negative social exchanges with
children (CNSE), and negative social exchanges with other rel-
atives/friends (ONSE). Each score was computed by summing
the responses to the two items. Among the younger respon-
dents, the internal consistency reliability estimates for these
scales ranged from .51 (ONSE) to .70 (CPSE). Among the
older respondents, the internal consistency reliability estimates
for the social exchange measures ranged from .47 (ONSE) to
.66 (OPSE). As can be seen in Table 2, for younger and older
adults alike, positive social exchange scores are substantially
higher than negative social exchange scores for each source.
Control variables. -- To control for spurious effects, sev-
eral additional variables were included in the multiple regres-
sion analyses. Age was measured in years; Black indicates
that the respondent's race is BlackVAfrican American and is
coded 1. Gender was coded as a contrast effect with men = -1
and women = +1. Education was measured as years of
schooling completed.
Since it is reasonable to expect that positive and negative so-
cial exchanges will vary by the amount of communication be-
tween respondents and their social network, two measures of
opportunities for social interaction were included in the analy-
ses. Contact (CONTACT) was assessed by summing re-
sponses to three items regarding frequency of interaction dur-
ing a typical week with relatives, friends, and neighbors: (a)
how often respondents talk on the telephone, (b) how often re-
spondents go out or get together in others' homes, and (c) how
often they attend meetings or programs of groups, clubs, or or-
ganizations. Responses range from 1 (never) to 6 (more than
once a week). Child contact (CCONTACT) was measured by
a single item asking respondents how often they have contact
with children 16 years and older not residing in the home.
Responses range from 1 (never) to 6 (more than once a week).
Functional health status (ADLT) was included because it is
strongly correlated with depressive symptoms (Newsom &
Schulz, 1996). In addition, an extensive body of literature
demonstrates that dependency and the need for care can create
burdens that may lead to conflict among patients, their families,
and their friends (DiMatteo & Hays, 1981). Functional health
status was measured using a Gutman-type scale with four
levels of impairment: (a) most severe category consists of
respondents who were confined to bed or chair and/or who
experienced a lot of difficulty bathing or could not bathe;
POSITIVEAND NEGATIVE SOCIAL EXCHANGES P13
(b) moderately severe category consists of respondents who
experienced a lot of difficulty climbing stairs or could not do it
and/or had a lot of difficulty walking or could not do it, but
were not in the highest severity category; (c) least severe cate-
gory consists of respondents who experienced a lot of difficulty
doing heavy housework or could not do it, but were not in the
two highest severity categories; and (4) no functional impair-
ment category consists of respondents who answered no to all
four of the functional impairment questions. The levels were
reverse coded so that higher scores indicate greater impairment.
RESULTS
Correlational Analysis
Age differences. -- Table 2 presents the results of bivariate
tests of age differences in the study variables. There, it can
be seen that Blacks were more prevalent in the younger
group than in the older group and women were more preva-
lent in the younger group (56%) than in the older group
(48%). This reversal of the trend for the ratio of women to
men to increase with age is probably due to using marital sta-
tus as a selection criterion.
Relative to younger respondents, older respondents had fewer
years of education. Older respondents had more contact with
older children living outside of the home than younger respon-
dents. The level of functional impairment was higher among
older respondents. Compared to younger respondents, older re-
spondents reported fewer negative social exchanges with all
three sources and more positive social exchanges with children.
Older and younger respondents did not differ in their frequency
of positive social exchanges with their spouses and other rela-
tives/friends and in their level of depressive symptoms.
Relations among sets of variables. -- The correlations
among the variables included in the present study, disaggre-
gated by age group, are presented in Table 3. First, we in-
spected the correlations between the control variables and the
social exchange variables. Within the older group, the strongest
relation was between social contact and positive social ex-
changes with other relatives/friends (r = .22). The second
largest relation was between gender and positive social ex-
change with one's spouse, with women reporting fewer posi-
tive social exchanges with their spouses than men (r = -.20).
Within the younger group, contact with older children living
outside of the home and positive social exchange with children
exhibited the strongest association (r = .41). The second largest
relation was between gender and positive social exchange with
other relatives/friends, with women reporting more positive so-
cial exchanges with other relatives/friends than men (r = .34).
Second, we observed which control variables and social
exchange variables had the highest correlation with depres-
sive symptoms. Among older respondents, functional impair-
ment was the strongest correlate of depressive symptoms (r =
.42). Among younger respondents, positive social exchanges
with one's spouse (r = -.31), and functional impairment (r =
.30), were related most strongly to depressive symptoms.

and positive social exchanges with the same source. All six
correlations relevant to this research question were negative
and significant at/? < .001 (see Table 3). For older adults, the
correlations between negative and positive social exchanges
with the same source ranged from -.24 for relationship with
other relatives/friends (ONSE with OPSE) to -.43 for rela-
tionship with spouse (SNSE with SPSE). For younger adults,
the correlations between negative and positive social ex-
changes with the same source ranged from -.23 for relation-
ship with other relatives/friends (ONSE with OPSE) to -.33
for relationship with spouse (SNSE with SPSE).
Multiple Regression Analyses
Main effects model. -- Our second research question per-
tained to the relative contribution of positive and negative so-
cial exchanges with different sources to the depressive symp-
toms of younger and older adults. To address this question,
we carried out two hierarchical regression analyses within
each age group. In one analysis, the seven control variables
were entered in the first step, the three positive social ex-
change variables were entered in the second step, and the
three negative social exchange variables were entered last. In
the other analysis, the order of entry for the positive and nega-
tive social exchange variables was reversed.
In the older adult sample, the control variables accounted
for 20.9% of the variance in depressive symptoms, F(7,841) =
31.76, p < .001. When the three positive social exchange vari-
ables were entered in the second step, they accounted for
8.6% of the variance in depressive symptoms, incremental
F(3, 838) = 34.19, p < .001. The net R2 associated with the
three negative social exchange predictors was .026, incremen-
tal F(3,835) = 10.53,/? < .001. When the three negative social
exchange variables were entered in the second step, they ex-
plained 7.2% of the variance in depressive symptoms, incre-
mental F(3,838) = 27.86, p < .001. The net R2 associated with
the three positive social exchange predictors was .040, incre-
mental F(3,835) = 16.49,/? < .001.
For younger adults, the control variables accounted for
13.5% of the variance in depressive symptoms, F(7,444) =
9.88, p < .001. When the three positive social exchange vari-
ables were entered in the second step, they accounted for
10.1% of the variance in depressive symptoms, incremental
F(3,441) = 19.30, p < .001. The net R2 associated with the
three negative social exchange predictors was .027, incremen-
tal F(3,338) = 5.43, p < .002. When the three negative social
exchange variables were entered in the second step, they ex-
plained 7.4% of the variance in depressive symptoms, incre-
mental F(3,441) = 13.72, p < .001. The net R2 associated with
the three positive social exchange predictors was .054, incre-
mental F(3,338) = 10.70, p < .001. Thus, for younger and
older adults alike, the net effects of positive social exchanges
exceeded the net effects of negative social exchanges.
Next, we entered all six positive and negative social interac-
tion predictors after the seven control variables. With all vari-
ables in the equation, the model for older adults accounted for
32.1% of the variance in depressive symptoms, F(13,835) =
30.37, p < .001. As can be seen in Table 4, among older adults,
positive social exchanges with children, other relatives/friends,
and spouse (CPSE, OPSE, and SPSE) all exerted significant,
negative effects on depressive symptoms, and negative social
exchanges with spouse and other relatives/friends (SNSE and
ONSE) were positive predictors of depressive symptoms.
With all variables in the equation, the model for younger
adults explained 26.3% of the variance in depressive symp-
toms, F(13,338) = 12.01, p < .001. Among younger adults,
SPSE was a significant negative predictor and SNSE was a
significant positive predictor of depressive symptoms.
We did not make any predictions regarding whether individ-
ual social exchange predictors would vary in their influence
across age groups. On a post hoc basis, we tested whether the
unstandardized regression coefficients associated with the six
social exchange predictors were equal in the older and
younger age groups (Marascuilo & Levin, 1983). Alpha was
set at .05 for the set of six comparisons. The results indicated
that positive social exchanges with one's spouse exerted a
greater influence in the younger (b = -.54) as compared to
older (b = -.17) age group, t (1,299) = 3.17,/? < .001.

question pertained to whether the effects of negative social ex-
changes with various sources is buffered by positive social ex-
changes with various sources. Following the recommendation
of Aiken and West (1991), we centered the negative and posi-
tive social exchange variables. For each variable within each
age group, this was accomplished by subtracting the mean
from each score in the distribution. To avoid problems associ-
ated with multicolinearity, we examined, in separate analyses,
whether the adverse effects of (a) negative social exchanges
with spouse; (b) negative social exchanges with children; and
(c) negative social exchanges with other relatives/friends were
cushioned by positive social exchanges with spouse, children,
and other relatives/friends, respectively.
Model I. SNSE by positive social exchange interaction ef-
fects. -- The negative social exchanges with spouse by posi-
tive social exchanges with (a) spouse; (b) children; and (c)
other relatives/friends product terms were entered into the
model after entering the seven control variables and the six
social exchange variables. For older adults, the set of interac-
tion terms approached significance, incremental F(3,832) =
2.41, p < .07, net R2 = .006. As can be seen in Table 5, only
the SNSE X CPSE interaction term was significant (/? < .05).
For younger adults, the three interaction terms collectively
made a significant contribution to the prediction of depressive
symptoms, incremental F(3,435) = 5.90, p < .001, net R2 =
.029. The only significant interaction term was negative social
exchanges with spouse by positive social exchanges with
spouse (SNSE by SPSE),/? < .01 (see Table 5).
Model II. CNSE by positive social exchange interaction ef-
fects. -- In a parallel analysis, we examined whether negative
social exchanges with children by positive social exchanges
with (a) one's spouse; (b) children; and (c) other relatives/
friends interaction terms make a significant incremental con-
tribution to the prediction of depressive symptoms among
older adults and younger adults above and beyond the control
and main effects variables. For the older adults, the three in-
teraction terms in concert approached significance, incremen-
tal F(3,832) = 2.18, p < .09, net R2 = .005. Individually, the
only significant interaction term was CNSE X OPSE, p < .05.
For the younger adults, the three interaction terms collectively
approached significance, incremental F(3,435) = 2.24, p <
.09, net R2 = .011. The only significant interaction term in-
volved CNSE X CPSE, p < .05.
Model III. ONSE by positive social exchange interaction
effects. -- In this analysis, we examined whether the negative
social exchanges with other relatives/friends by positive so-
cial exchange with each of the three sources make a signifi-
cant incremental contribution to the prediction of depressive
symptoms above and beyond the control and main effects
variables. For older adults, the three interaction terms together
were significant, incremental F(3,832) = 7.94, p < .001, net R2
= .019. Individually, both the ONSE X CPSE and ONSE X
OPSE interaction terms were unique predictors of depressive
symptoms (highest/? < .001). For younger adults, the three in-
teraction terms as a set also made a significant contribution to
the prediction of depressive symptoms, incremental F(3,435)
= 4.44, net R2 = .022. The only significant interaction term
wasONSEXOPSE,/?<.05.
Model IV. Gender by negative social exchange by positive
social exchange interaction effects. -- Our final research
question addressed whether gender moderated the joint ef-
fects of negative and positive social exchanges. Within each
age group, three models were constructed. In the first model,
in the first step, the control variables and the main effect so-
cial exchange variables were entered. In the second step, nine
two-way interaction terms were entered (gender by each of
the six social exchange variables and negative social ex-
changes with spouse by the three positive social exchange
variables). In the last step, the Gender X SNSE X SPSE,
Gender X SNSE X CPSE, and Gender X SNSE X OPSE
three-way interaction effects were entered. In the second
model, CNSE replaced SNSE in three of the two-way interac-
tion terms and in the three three-way interaction terms. In the
third model, ONSE replaced CNSE in three of the two-way
interaction terms and in the three three-way interaction terms.
These models revealed no significant (p > .05) three-way in-
teraction effects.
Probes of the significant interaction effects. -- For each sig-
nificant two-way interaction effect, we examined the simple
slopes associated with the negative social exchange predictor
variable at particular values of the positive social exchange
moderator variable. These simple slopes were generated ac-
cording to procedures described by Aiken and West (1991).
We computed the slope for the predictor variable at exemplar
high, average, and low values (i.e., +1 SD, 0 SD, and -1 SD)
of the moderator variable.

Table 6 summarizes the slopes and intercepts generated using
these procedures. For older adults, the results provide some sup-
port for the nption that negative social exchanges with one
source are buffered by positive social exchanges with another
source. CPSE buffers the inimical effect of SNSE on depressive
symptoms. SNSE is significantly (p < .001), positively related to
depressive symptoms unless CPSE is high. We see evidence of
"quasi" buffering for the CNSE X OPSE interaction effect.
Although CNSE is not significantly related to depressive symp-
toms at low, average or high values of OPSE, the trend is for the
slope of CNSE to be positive when OPSE is low and to be nega-
tive when OPSE is high. Inspection of the simple slopes associ-
ated with the ONSE X CPSE interaction effect among older
adults indicates that CPSE buffers the adverse influence of
ONSE on depressive symptoms. When CPSE is high, ONSE
does not have a significant effect on depressive symptoms. The
form of the ONSE X OPSE interaction effect indicates "re-
verse" buffering. As can be seen in Figure 1, ONSE exhibits a
significant (highest p < .01), positive relation with depressive
symptoms when OPSE is either average or high.
For younger adults, the results do not support the notion
that buffering is associated with negative and positive ex-
changes from different sources. Contrary to this notion, SPSE
buffers the adverse impact of SNSE on depressive symptoms.
SNSE is significantly (p < .001), positively related to depres-
sive symptoms only when SPSE is low. CPSE appears to be a
quasi buffer of the influence of CNSE on depressive symp-
toms. Although CNSE is not significantly related to depres-
sive symptoms at low, average, or high values of CPSE, the
trend is for the slope of CNSE to be positive when CPSE is
low and to be negative when CPSE is high. OPSE cushions

exhibits a significant (p < .05), positive relation with depres-

Because we did not make predictions regarding whether
the two-way interaction effects between negative and positive
social exchanges would differ across age groups, we tested
whether the unstandardized regression coefficients associated
with the six interaction terms listed in Table 5 were equal on a
post hoc basis. Alpha was set at .05 for the set of six compar-
isons. The results indicated that the unstandardized regression
coefficient associated with the interaction between SNSE and
SPSE was significantly different in the older (b = .02) and
younger (b = -.14) groups, t (1,299) = 2.74, p < .005. In addi-
tion, the unstandardized regression coefficient associated with
the interaction between ONSE and OPSE was significantly
different in the older (b = .15) and younger (b = -.14) groups,
t (1,299) = 4.02, p<. 001.
DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY
Our major findings are reviewed and discussed below.
First, we examine our findings with respect to the association
between measures of negative and positive social exchanges.
Second, we consider the relative contribution of negative and
positive social exchange to the prediction of depressive symp-
toms. Third, we summarize our findings with respect to the
joint effects of negative and positive social exchanges on de-
pressive symptoms within each age group. Fourth, we com-
ment on our findings with respect to gender as a moderator of
the joint effects of negative and positive social exchanges. We
conclude with a discussion of limitations and some directions
for future research.
Independence ofNegative and Positive Social Exchanges
The findings from studies employing factor analysis (e.g.,
Finch et al., 1989) and studies using correlational analyses on
aggregate measures of negative and positive social exchanges
(e.g., Rook, 1984) have lead researchers to conclude that neg-
ative and positive social exchanges are unrelated (Rook,
1990). Contrary to this view, several studies found inverse as-
POSITIVEAND NEGATIVE SOCIAL EXCHANGES P17
sociations between negative and positive social exchanges
within some sources (e.g., Vinokur & van Ryn, 1993).
Using source-specific measures, the median correlation be-
tween negative and positive social exchanges with the same
source was -.27 and -.39 in the younger and older age
groups, respectively. By comparison, when different sources
were involved, the median correlation between negative and
positive social exchanges was -.155 and -.15 in the younger
and older age group, respectively. Thus, in both age groups,
there appears to be a stronger relation between negative and
positive social exchanges when respondents are rating the
same source as compared to different sources.
Among younger and older respondents alike, the associa-
tion between negative and positive social exchanges with the
same source was strongest when the source was one's spouse
rather than children and other relatives/friends. One possibil-
ity is that the association between positive and negative social
exchanges is stronger when a specific individual is rated as
opposed to a category of people (e.g., spouse as opposed to
children). Alternatively, the inverse relation between positive
and negative social exchanges may be stronger when more, as
opposed to less, intimate sources are rated. Unfortunately, in
the present study, source intimacy and category size cannot be
disentangled. The magnitude of the largest correlation (-.43)
suggests that in both age groups the absence of negative so-
cial exchanges cannot be equated with an abundance of posi-
tive social exchanges.
Relative Contribution of Negative and Positive Social
Exchanges
Researchers studying the additive effects of negative and
positive social exchanges on depressive symptoms have
sometimes found that negative social exchanges are more po-
tent predictors of depressive symptoms than positive social
exchanges (e.g., Ruehlman & Wolchik, 1988), whereas other
researchers have found that negative and positive social ex-
changes exert comparable effects on depressive symptoms
(e.g., Manne & Zautra, 1989). From our literature review, we
concluded that the differential effect of negative relative to
positive social exchanges on depressive symptoms might be
stronger among older adults relative to younger adults.
Instead, we found that positive social exchanges exerted a
stronger unique effect on depressive symptoms than negative
social exchanges in both the younger and older adult samples.
In the case of negative social exchanges, few individuals are
nominated as providers and thus, aggregated and disaggre-
gated measures may be equally predictive of depressive
symptoms. In contrast, many individuals are nominated as
providers of positive social exchanges. Consequently, aggre-
gate measures that sum over ratings of support from diverse
providers may mask the effects of key network members
(Barrera et al., 1993). Our findings with respect to younger
adults are consistent with the notion that disaggregated mea-
sures may be more predictive of depressive symptoms than
aggregated measures. Specifically, within the younger adult
group, the key source of positive social exchanges was one's
spouse (see House, Umberson, & Landis, 1988).
For older adults, however, positive social exchanges with
various sources are all associated with having relatively few
depressive symptoms. With age, positive social interaction
with close friends and children, as well as one's spouse, may
be important for sustaining emotional health (Adams &
Blieszner, 1995). It should be noted that the comparison of
the effects of the social exchange predictors in the older and
younger groups yielded only one significant difference: SPSE
was a stronger predictor of depressive symptoms in the
younger group than in the older group.
Joint Effects of Negative and Positive Social Exchanges
With the exception of Lepore's (1992) study, researchers
have not examined whether positive social exchanges buffer
negative social exchanges when different sources are in-
volved in the negative and positive exchanges. Building upon
the theorizing and findings of Lepore (1992), we examined
whether buffering effects are more likely to occur when dif-
ferent sources as opposed to the same sources are involved in
the negative and positive social exchanges.
Older adults. -- The findings of the present study for older
adults offer qualified support for the "different source" buffer-
ing hypothesis. Positive social exchanges with children cush-
ioned the adverse effects of negative social exchanges with
both spouse and other relatives/friends. Furthermore, when
older adults experienced negative social exchanges with chil-
dren, positive social exchanges with other relatives/friends
were most helpful.
Children appear to be effective support providers to older
adults when problematic social interaction occurs with other
members of their social network. Approximately 80% of
older parents visit with one of their children on a biweekly
basis (Krout, 1988). Furthermore, children are likely to be
well acquainted with the source of the problematic social in-
teraction, and may offer different and fresh perspectives from
one's spouse (Rossi & Rossi, 1990). When children are the
source of the negative social exchanges, friends and other rel-
atives may be best positioned to provide unique perspectives
on the problematic social tie.
The form of the same-source interaction effect for negative
and positive social exchanges with other/relatives friends sug-
gests "reverse" buffering (see Figure 1). ONSE exerted its
largest effect when OPSE was high. Barrera et al. (1993) sug-
gest an explanation for this effect, which they refer to as conflict
neutralization. According to this explanation, high conflict with
a network member neutralizes the potential benefits of support
from that person. Therefore, when conflict is high, social sup-
port does not influence depressive symptoms. In contrast, when
conflict is low, as social support increases, depressive symptoms
decrease. Barrera et al. (1993) also suggested that conflict neu-
tralization may be more likely to occur in the context of low-
intimacy relationships. The category of support, "other rela-
tives/friends," may very well include network members with
whom the focal person has low-intimacy relationships.
Younger adults. -- Tests of interaction effects among
younger adults did not confirm the different source buffering
hypothesis. Instead, buffering effects were observed when
negative and positive exchanges occurred with the same
source. Buffering effects for the same source have been occa-
sionally observed in previous research. In the Abbey et al.
(1985) study, support buffered conflict for "some one per-
P18 OKUNAND KEITH
son." In the Barrera et al. (1993) study, support buffered con-
flict for siblings in the nonalcoholic father sample. In the
Schuster et al. (1990) study, support buffered conflict for rela-
tives. At least two explanations for these effects can be pro-
vided. First, Schuster et al. (1990) suggested that negative so-
cial interactions with a network member are perceived as less
serious when they occur in the context of a highly supportive
relationship. Second, it is possible that support is viewed as
very helpful when it comes from a network member who
sometimes responds negatively to requests for assistance.
The comparison of the negative by positive social exchange
interaction effects in the older and younger groups yielded two
significant differences. The SNSE X SPSE interaction effect
was a stronger predictor of depressive symptoms in the
younger than in the older group. The form of the ONSE X
OPSE interaction effect was different in the younger and older
groups. In the younger group, OPSE buffered the adverse ef-
fect of ONSE. In contrast, in the older group, OPSE amplified
the adverse effect of ONSE on depressive symptoms.
The configuration of findings discussed above raises an in-
triguing question: Why do same source buffering effects
occur in the younger adult sample whereas different source
buffering effects occur in the older adult sample? One expla-
nation can be derived from socioemotional selectivity theory
(Carstensen, 1992). According to this theory, as people age,
they become more select in their social relationships, seeking
to maintain relationships with people who enhance their emo-
tional well-being. Our findings with respect to age differences
in social exchanges are consistent with this notion. Relative to
younger respondents, older respondents reported fewer nega-
tive social exchanges with spouse, children, and other rela-
tives/friends. At the same time, older respondents, as com-
pared to younger respondents, reported more positive social
exchanges with children and equivalent levels of positive so-
cial exchanges with spouse and other relatives/friends.
One consequence of increasing social selectivity with age
may be that older people are more reliant than younger people
on fewer network members for their social support (Antonucci
et al., 1996). To avoid jeopardizing relationships with key sup-
port providers, older people may be more likely than younger
people to seek support for interpersonal stress from sources
not linked to the stress. This notion is consistent with Hirsch's
(1980) finding that women making life transitions fared better
if they compartmentalized their social networks.
Gender as a Moderator Variable
We found no evidence that the joint effects of negative and
positive social exchanges on depressive symptoms is condi-
tioned by gender. In other studies that have looked at Gender
X Negative Social Exchanges and Gender X Positive Social
Exchanges interaction effects, the results have been inconsis-
tent. Whereas some researchers have found that negative so-
cial exchanges exert a stronger influence on depressive symp-
toms among women than men (Henderson et al.> 1980;
Schuster et al., 1990), other researchers have found no
evidence that gender moderates the negative social ex-
change-depressive symptoms relation (Semple, 1992; Turner,
1994). Similarly, positive social exchanges have been found
to relate more strongly to depressive symptoms among
women than men in some studies (Abbey et al., 1995;
Schuster et al., 1990) but not other studies (Dean et al., 1990;
Vinokur et al., 1996). Perhaps, research on gender differences
in the effects of social exchanges would benefit by focusing
on gender-role identity (Hyde, Krajnik, & Skuldt-Nieder-
berger, 1991) as a moderator variable.
Limitations
The present study has at least two major limitations. One lim-
itation pertains to the measures of social exchanges. These mea-
sures have limited reliability and variability. In addition, they do
not tap important dimensions of relational content, such as aid
and hostility/impatience. Furthermore, although the measures
pertaining to children and other relatives/friends were source-
specific, they were not provider-specific. Therefore, it is not pos-
sible in the present study to ascertain whether the same indi-
viduals were the source of the negative and positive social
exchanges with children and with other relatives/friends. The
second limitation of the present study relates to its cross-sec-
tional design. The relations between positive and negative social
exchanges and depressive symptoms may well be reciprocal.
Future Directions
The present study suggests several topics for future re-
search. One topic pertains to the meaning of positive and nega-
tive social exchanges across adulthood. For example, adult
children and their aging parents may interpret the demands
made on them in qualitatively distinct ways (Fingerman,
1996). Similarly, tangible assistance may be perceived in a
very different manner by adult children and their aging parents
(Antonucci et al., 1996). Thus, the equivalence of measures of
positive and negative social exchanges with specific providers
across age groups should be investigated. A second issue per-
tains to the relation between negative and positive social ex-
changes. It is important to determine whether this relation
varies with the intimacy of the recipient-provider relationship
and/or the specificity of the recipient-provider relationship.
In the present study, older respondents reported fewer neg-
ative social exchanges than younger respondents. Longi-
tudinal analyses could be performed to determine whether
negative social exchanges decrease with age and, if so, why.
One possibility is that with age individuals become more
adept at regulating their emotions (Lawton, Kleban,
Rajagopal, & Dean, 1992). Furthermore, it would be interest-
ing to ascertain the effects of positive and negative social ex-
changes with specific network members on adults' depressive
symptoms. For example, building on the work of Hirsch and
Rapkin (1986a), do positive social exchanges with one's best
friend mitigate the inimical effect of negative social ex-
changes with one's spouse? Future research is warranted to
examine why positive social exchanges tend to buffer nega-
tive social exchanges among older adults when different
sources are involved whereas buffering effects tend to occur
among younger adults when the same source is involved.
Finally, more work is needed that investigates the process(es)
by which negative and positive social exchanges exert joint ef-
fects on depressive symptoms. In the present study, we adopted
a stress-buffering perspective in which we assumed that follow-
ing interpersonal stress, the focal person turns to other network
members for help. Alternatively, it is possible to conceptualize
the joint effects that were observed in the present study in terms
POSITIVEAND NEGATIVE SOCIAL EXCHANGES P19
of conflict enhancing the benefits of positive social exchanges.
According to this view, the benefits of positive social exchanges
become more potent in the context of negative social interac-
tions. For example, positive social exchanges with a close friend
may evoke more positive affect when they are preceded by neg-
ative, as opposed to positive, spousal interactions.
In conclusion, in the majority of studies of positive and neg-
ative social exchanges, researchers have used measures in
which either no provider was specified or responses were ag-
gregated over diverse sources. These approaches appear to be
problematic for older adults because family members and
friends serve different functions (Larson, Mannell, & Zuzanek,
1986; Rook, 1994). Our findings indicate that the relations
among negative social ties, positive social ties, and psycholog-
ical outcomes are more complex than originally conceived.
Specifically, they highlight the importance of taking into ac-
count the age of the recipient and the provider-recipient rela-
tionship when studying the joint influence of negative and pos-
itive social exchanges on adults' depressive symptoms.
