Introduction
"Do union mergers affect the members?" asked Sverke,
Chaison, and Sjöberg (2004) in their study of two Swedish
blue-collar unions. This question, and a subsequent one,
"How do union mergers affect the members?" have occu-
pied my mind ever since one of my students chose to exam-
ine the impact on the membership of the Printing and
Kindred Industries Union (PKIU) when it amalgamated
with the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union
(AMWU) in Western Australia in the early 1990s (Moy,
2008, pp. 19-31). As is discussed further below, much has
been written about union amalgamation in Australia, espe-
cially with regard to the federal peak body, the Australian
Council of Trade Unions' (ACTU) strategy of creating so-
called "super unions" in the 1980s. Much less has been
written on the impacts upon membership. Using the exam-
ple of the amalgamation of the railway and tram workers'
unions in Australia in 1993, and a methodology employing
worker interviews and historical archives including union
correspondence, this article considers the impact of amal-
gamation on the rank and file membership of the West
Australian Locomotive Engine Drivers, Firemen's and
Cleaners Union (henceforth LEDU). Secondary historical
and industrial relations literature, including the author's
published work, will be used to draw comparisons with
other Australian and British unions.
The LEDU, founded in 1898, covered employees who
were known in the railway industry as footplate staff--ini-
tially the drivers, firemen, and cleaners of steam locomotives,
but later the drivers and assistant drivers on diesel engines.
These men saw themselves as having different working con-
ditions and interests from other railway staff such as guards,
signalmen, porters, and ticket collectors. This perceived dif-
ference was even more acute when comparing themselves
with inspectors and stationmasters (seen as being "bosses"),
who were members of the Railway Officers' Union (ROU;
Oliver, 2016, p. 460). Furthermore, they were intensely proud
of being railwaymen--and engine drivers in particular. Given
that these men saw themselves as an elite, with different inter-
ests even from other railway staff, how did they react when,
in its centenary year, their union merged with members
of rival unions, who had not earned the particular mystique of
being footplate men? What has amalgamation cost in terms of
trade identity? If there has been a marked loss of trade iden-
tity, has this contributed to declining membership numbers?

The Impact of Union Amalgamation on
Membership: An Australian Case Study
Bobbie Oliver1
Abstract
In 1980s and 1990s, Australian trade unions tried to combat declining influence and membership numbers by amalgamating
with other unions in the same or related industries. Much has been written on union mergers, but little on how these affect
the membership. This article aims to contribute to the literature of the impact of mergers and amalgamations on members
but studying just one union, The West Australian Locomotive Engine Drivers, Firemen's and Cleaners Union (LEDU; 1898-
1999). In 1993, the three federal railway unions--the Australian Railways Union (ARU), the Australian Federated Union of
Locomotive Employees (AFULE), and the National Union of Railworkers (NUR), and one bus and tram union, the Australian
Tramway & Motor Omnibus Employees Association (ATM)--amalgamated to become the Australian Rail Tram and Bus
Industry Union (RTBU). The LEDU reluctantly joined the RTBU in 1999. This article examines rank and file reaction to the
initial proposals and ultimately to becoming part of a larger union, covering workers with many different interests. The article
concludes that, irrespective of whether or not amalgamation was inevitable, given the circumstances in Western Australia at
the time, its impact upon the rank and file membership was devastating.

union, the LEDU, the article aims to provide an insight into
the way that amalgamation affected individual lives, as well
as its more general impact on the rank and file, and thereby
contribute to the literature on this question.
Method
Much of the research for this article was carried out while I
was writing a history of the LEDU (Oliver, 2016). It involved
accessing several hundred LEDU files (now part of the
Transport Workers Union collection) in the State Library of
Western Australia and the records of WA Government
Railways (later Westrail) in the State Records Office of
Western Australia. For the purposes of this article, the most
relevant records were correspondence files and minutes of
meetings from the 1980s and 1990s concerning amalgama-
tion. Comparative British material was researched in the
records of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers
and Firemen (ASLEF) lodged at the Modern Records Centre,
University of Warwick, UK.
To access the opinions of the rank and file, I drew upon the
22 interviews that I conducted between 2012 and 2014 and
other interviews in the oral history collection of the J.S.
Battye Library of West Australian History (part of the State
Library of Western Australia), as well as secondary literature.
Only some of the men whom I interviewed commented on
union amalgamation; some had retired before this occurred,
or had moved into other work and were no longer LEDU
members. Interviewees included a former State Secretary of
the union, a former branch secretary, and the State Secretary
of the Australian Rail Tram and Bus Industry Union (RTBU),
the union with which the LEDU merged in 1999. Those who
commented on amalgamation expressed strong opinions
about whether the move benefited the membership.
The Literature on Union
Amalgamations
Unfortunately, union historians have often dealt briefly, if
at all, with the impact of amalgamation on the rank and file.
Of members' attitudes to the newly formed AMWU, for
example, Sheridan (1975) devoted only a few lines, when
he wrote, at the end of his history of the Amalgamated
Engineering Union (AEU):
While many members no doubt experienced a twinge of regret
for the final passing of the old order, AEU activists now felt
much better equipped to cope with the new era of industrial
relations ushered in by contemporary radical changes in the
arbitration and bargaining areas and the appearance in Canberra
of the first Labor government in 23 years. (p. 304)
Hence, the power that amalgamation gave to the newAMWU,
according to Sheridan, outweighed sentiment. Similarly Peter
O'Connor (2005), discussing the merger that created the Rail,
Tram, and Bus Union in New South Wales, wrote that the new
union was a "sensible grouping of rail unions" which created
"a strong industry union that could serve each of their tradi-
tional constituents from a stronger bargaining position"
(p. 86). This merger undoubtedly had more chance of success
as all of the unions involved represented road or rail transport
industry workers, yet it contained the Australian Federated
Union of Locomotive Employees (AFULE), who--like the
LEDU--had formerly resisted all attempts to merge with the
ARU. The problem of accommodating multiple interests
became even more complex within unions such as theAMWU,
which now covers a wide range of employees including those
in the metal working, vehicle and ship building, plumbing, and
food and printing industries (Reeves & Dettmer, 2013).
Most studies of union amalgamation are concerned with
whether the strategy succeeded in increasing union power,
enabling economies through more efficient use of resources,
and achieving improved wages and conditions for members
(see, for example, Fairbrother, 2000; Hose & Rimmer, 2002;
Wooden, 1999). Some have considered how individual
unions have resisted amalgamation (e.g., Michelson, 1997;
Oliver, 2016). At least two studies have addressed the spe-
cific issue of the impact upon the rank and file. As mentioned
in this article's "Introduction" section, Sverke et al. (2004)
raised the important question of the impact of union mergers
on members. To ascertain how a merger affected union rank
and file of two blue-collar unions in Sweden, Sverke et al.
surveyed a sample of 237 Clothing Workers'and 755 Factory
Workers' members prior to, shortly after, and then 2 years
after the event. The rationale for the merger included finan-
cial necessity and the need to operate more efficiently, but,
more importantly, it was influenced by a desire to improve
"lower-level representational structures" and create a flatter
structure to "increase the closeness between the members
and their union." Thus the aim of the merger, rather than to
"absorb" a smaller union into a larger one, was to create a
completely new union covering clothing and factory workers
(Sverke et al., 2004, p. 106). The authors found that "mem-
bership commitment, satisfaction and participation do not
necessarily have to be sacrificed for the benefit of building
larger, more stable and powerful unions through mergers"
(Sverke et al., 2004, p. 103). They concluded that "the
absence of negative consequences of the merger can be
traced to how and why the merger was proposed and negoti-
ated. The merger brought about more member participation
at the local level and decentralized decision making" (Sverke
et al., 2004, p. 118). This did not occur in the Australian
unions discussed in this article, and especially not in the
LEDU that is the subject of the case study.
Regarding the amalgamation of the PKIU with theAMWU
in 1995, Moy (2008) found a strong desire among the PKIU
officials whom she interviewed to retain a printing division
within the larger union. Factors affecting railway employees
had also impacted upon the printing industry. Just as in the
railways, printers had ceased to operate in a closed shop, and
Oliver 3
declining numbers--which had dropped from 51,000 mem-
bers nation-wide in 1982 to half that number in 2007--pro-
vided a major impetus for amalgamation (Moy, 2008).
Consequently, despite fears of the printers'identity being sub-
merged in the culture of the metal workers who dominated the
AMWU, amalgamation was regarded as being the only viable
solution for the PKIU. It has retained a separate identity as the
AMWU Printing Division, although at least one of the inter-
viewees in Moy's study did not think that this had been
entirely successful. Unlike my study of the LEDU, however,
Moy's study did not canvas the views of the rank and file
membership of printers.
Why Did Australian Unions
Amalgamate?
Australian trade unions developed sometimes in parallel,
sometimes in advance of their counterparts in Britain (Kirk,
2011). They achieved recognition in the 19th and early 20th
centuries, grew stronger, and flourished mid-century, when
more than 50% of the workforce was unionized and declined
from the 1970s (Crosby, 2005). A significant factor in unions
gaining the right to present their members was the institution
of State and Federal Arbitration Courts (Kirk, 2011), where
unions were registered, at the beginning of the 20th century.
Western Australia was the first Australian state to adopt the
arbitration system, passing legislation in 1900 that established
the Arbitration Court prior to Australian Federation. New
South Wales (1901), the Commonwealth (1904), and the
remaining states followed suit, although Victoria, Tasmania,
and initially South Australia adopted a less judicial system of
wages boards. Wages boards differed chiefly in their compo-
sition and procedures. They were composed of representa-
tives of employers and employees with an independent
chairperson, and they could act without the formal require-
ment of a dispute. Unions, however, preferred an arbitration
system, which granted them official recognition as represen-
tatives of their members and permitted preference for union
members in employment. Eventually the mechanisms of the
two systems converged (Macintyre, 1998a, 1998b).
Despite British and American workers' suspicions that a
compulsory arbitration system would favor employers
(Oliver, 2016), in Australia, the reverse was true, nowhere
quite so evidently as in Western Australia, where legislation
had to be passed to legalize trade unions before they could be
registered as partners in the industrial wage system. But the
system also placed restrictions on union rules and conduct.
Originally, unions that chose the path of strike action were
notpermittedtoappearintheArbitrationCourt.Consequently,
militants regarded arbitration as a "sham," while employers,
on the contrary, wanted the Court to impose penalties on
strikers (Macintyre, 2005). On occasions this resulted in a
union being de-registered, as happened to the LEDU briefly
following a strike in 1946 (Oliver, 2016).
The British concept of a "closed shop"--a workplace
where all employees must belong to a union--flourished in
Australian factories and workshops. Thus, not only was a
majority of workers unionized, but there were also many dif-
ferent unions, often operating only at the state or local level,
even in government-owned facilities such as railway work-
shops. The Western Australian Government Railway
(WAGR) Workshops at Midland in Western Australia pro-
vides just one example of the proliferation and then reduc-
tion of the number of unions on a worksite. In the early to
mid-20th century, two separate, rival unions covered engi-
neers, and the trades of molder, boilermaker, blacksmith, car
and wagon builder, coachbuilder, painter, plumber, carpen-
ter, coppersmith, and electrician each had its own union.
There was also a "catch all" government railway employees
union--the Western Australian Amalgamated Society of
Railway Employees (WAASRE)--which included unskilled
laborers in its coverage. The impact of amalgamation was
such that by the time the Workshops closed in 1994, only
four unions covered all of the trades and the clerical staff on
the site (Layman, 2006).
Several factors caused this decrease in union numbers.
According to Sheridan (1975), metal workers' unions were
working toward amalgamation from the late 1950s. Reasons
for this included technological changes (which resulted in
the disappearance of some trades, such as boilermakers),
joint union efforts to achieve outcomes at arbitration tribu-
nals, and an increased feeling of solidarity brought about by
both the tribunals' use of penal powers and the increasing
importance of shop committees consisting of representatives
from kindred unions within a workplace. In the late 1960s,
changes to the wage system sparked industrial stoppages,
and a growing perception that employers were becoming
more powerful provided further impetus for unions to con-
sider amalgamation as a strategy for increasing their bargain-
ing power.
A catalyst for the union amalgamations that occurred in the
1960s and 1970s, particularly in Western Australia, was the
iron ore mining industry, which commenced in the Pilbara
region during the 1960s. Union officials visiting mine sites
found poor conditions, a largely unorganized, non-unionized
workforce and multi-national employers with very hostile atti-
tudes to unionism. Amalgamation, therefore, was a strategy
for increasing union strength and resources in an adversarial
environment. The first amalgamation to affect the railway
industry was that of Boilermakers and Blacksmiths (separate
unions who had combined in one Society in 1966), and the
AEU to form the AMWU in 1971. These unions represented
several trades in the railway workshops but not members of
railway footplate or platform staff. In 1969-1970, waterfront
unions covering ship builders and painters, waterside workers,
and watchmen formed the MaritimeWorkers Union ofWestern
Australia (Oliver, 2003). Although this merger was limited to
Western Australia, this union later joined with the nation-wide
Maritime Union ofAustralia (MUA), formed in 1993 from the
4 SAGE Open
Waterside Workers Federation and the Seamen's Union
(Kirkby, 2008). The WAASRE joined with its federal counter-
part to become the Australian Railways Union (ARU), WA
Branch, in the 1970s. The ARU had been in existence in the
Eastern States since 1920 (Patmore, 1982).
Whereas the amalgamations of the late 1960s and early
1970s had been instigated by the challenge of meeting indus-
trial changes in the mining industry and perceptions of
increased employer power, those of 20 years later were
brought about by an environment in which, by the beginning
of the 1990s, "union membership had declined from 51 per
cent of the Australian workforce in 1976 to 42 per cent in
1988" and trade unions were "fighting for their very survival
in the face of industrial and economic reorganization" and
"legal and political onslaughts on the conditions of work and
workers' rights to organize" (Kirkby, 2008, pp. 392-393).
Several factors contributed to this decline. Computerized
systems replaced much manual labor. Railways, in a period
of three or four decades, had passed from very labor inten-
sive steam, through dieselization to a mix of diesel and elec-
tric. Trades such as blacksmiths and carriage makers
disappeared when fiberglass and aluminum replaced wood
as the material for building carriages and wagons (Fox,
2006). The proportion of private industry (often with non-
unionized workforces) increased, and governments began
outsourcing contracts to private manufacturers, resulting in
the closure of government railway workshops at Ipswich
(Queensland) Eveleigh (NSW), Launceston (Tasmania), and
Midland (WA) in the last two decades of the 20th century
(Elliott, 2006; Oliver, 2004; Taksa, 2001). The workforce
underwent considerable demographic change, caused by an
increased proportion of white-collar occupations, which are
traditionally less organized.
Perhaps more significant than all of these changes, how-
ever, were the legislative changes instituted by Federal Labor
governments at the beginning of the 1990s, which permitted
single-employer agreements (enterprise bargaining) and
non-union agreements. The resulting "fragmentation of bar-
gaining practices . . . eroded the capacity of the ACTU to
coordinate unions in the bargaining sector" because it had
lost the "bargaining power to negotiate enterprise agree-
ments" (Briggs, 2004, p. 251). A paradigm shift occurred in
the way Australian society viewed unions. John Howard
(Australian Prime Minister 1996-2007) fostered an attitude
that strong unions threatened Australia's economic perfor-
mance, rather than playing a beneficial role in the commu-
nity. Blame has also been leveled at unions themselves.
According to Michael Crosby (2005), unions had grown
complacent, partly because mid-century, they had enjoyed a
workforce density of 63%. There was increasing disquiet
among the rank and file that their officials struck too many
"deals . . . with the boss," and these did not always benefit
the membership.
Another motivation for amalgamation arose from the fear
that what was happening to New Zealand unions would soon
occur in Australia. Crosby argued that Australian companies,
including the major banks, used New Zealand to test de-
unionization strategies before attempting them in Australia.
He asserted that New Zealand's Employment Workplace
Relations Act 1991 influenced the design of Australia's
Workplace Relations Act, 1996, and that the survival of
Australian unions was "intimately linked with the survival of
organised labour in New Zealand" (Crosby, 2005, p. 238).
In summary, then, Australian unions benefited from their
integral role within arbitration and tariff systems that pro-
tected employers from outside competition. Their high mem-
bership density, achieved through successfully negotiating
gains for their rank and file within the organized structure of
arbitration, enabled to them to hold a privileged position in
Australian society. Traditionally, the union movement had
paid little attention to industries with a high proportion of
female workers when these were a minority in the workforce.
This complacency, combined with external circumstances
including the numerical decline of the traditional union
heartland--the industrial, highly skilled blue-collar work-
force; the increase of non-organized occupations such as
hospitality; and the de-regulation of the industrial relations
system led to a reduction in union membership numbers and
density in the workforce. In the last two decades of the 20th
century, government policies from both sides of politics
favored the privatizing of industries, and gave employers
freedom to hire non-unionized workers and broker non-
union agreements and employees the right to choose whether
or not they would join a union. With the era of the closed
shop well and truly passed in Australia, some claimed that
unions were facing oblivion (Crosby, 2005), although other
commentators regarded the "end-of-unionism-as-a-move-
ment thesis" as being "over-simplified, over-generalised and
over-deterministic" (Briggs, 2004, p. 253). In this uncertain
environment, some saw "super unions"--a strategy proposed
by the ACTU in the 1980s--as the only viable means of sur-
vival. With unions perceiving threats to their very existence,
it is likely that what the rank and file wanted was a secondary
consideration.
Case Study: The LEDU
In Western Australia for much of the 20th century, the two
main unions for railway staff were the LEDU, representing
all footplate staff and engine cleaners, and the WAASRE,
which covered all other wage-earning railway staff (such as
guards, porters, crane and forklift drivers, trades assistants,
and unskilled laborers). The much smaller ROU repre-
sented railways clerical staff, stationmasters, and inspec-
tors. To give some idea of the comparative sizes of these
unions in their heyday, figures published in August 1948,
when the population of Western Australia was a little more
than half a million (Caldwell, 1988), show that the
WAASRE registered almost 5,000 workers--being the sec-
ond largest union in Western Australia, after the Australian
Oliver 5
Workers' Union, which had over 10,000 members. In com-
parison, the LEDU mustered fewer than 1,500 members
(The West Australian, 1948, p. 24). As mentioned earlier,
in the 1970s, the WAASRE amalgamated with its Eastern
States counterpart, the ARU.
Officials of the LEDU had begun considering amalgama-
tion in the late 1970s after membership declined, but rather
than negotiating with the ARU--which (despite the per-
ceived differences mentioned earlier in this article) at least
covered other railway workers in the traffic branch--the
union began talks with theAMWU.Approaching theAMWU
(then titled the Australian Metal Workers Union) was an
interesting move, given the union's steadfast refusal to join
with WAASRE on several earlier occasions when that union
had made overtures; however, as the AMWU covered former
AEU, boilermakers', and blacksmiths' members, and was a
militant union, ideological similarity may provide the key to
understanding it. Historically, all of these unions were more
militant than the ARU, and they had supported the LEDU
when it took strike action in 1946 (Oliver, 2016).
Yet LEDU members were keen to maintain a separate
identity if a merger occurred. They belonged to the
AFULE, forming the WA Branch of the Federal body, but
this was a loose knit, semi-autonomous federation of State
branches. The fact that the WA union--alone of all those
that entered into the AFULE in 1921--kept its original
name indicates the strong desire to retain independence.
According to LEDU official Jack Bainbridge (Oral history
interview, State Library of Western Australia [SLWA]
Accession No. OH 2056, transcript, 1998), the members
were prepared to amalgamate "on the condition that we
can retain our identity" (p. 23). He said that members of
many years standing were proud of being enginemen and
they did not want to just become part of a larger union.
Thus, he felt that maintaining their "identity" was very
important to the members.
In 1983, in the Eastern States, theAFULE began talks with
the ARU, with a view to forming one union of railway work-
ers (Ellercamp, 1983). The LEDU opposed the amalgamation
plans, in particular because, according to Des McPolin (the
union's State Secretary 1986-1996), the proposed amalgama-
tion discussions had been arranged without adequate consul-
tation. McPolin warned that if talks continued before all of
the Divisions had been consulted and given a full opportunity
to discuss the proposal, the WADivision would prefer to enter
into amalgamation discussions with other Western Australian
unions, with whom it felt it had more in common. McPolin
(1987) expressed similar sentiments to AFULE General
President Ron Bradford as those of Jack Bainbridge, quoted
earlier. He wrote that locomotive enginemen were "a proud
breed of workers" who would not be intimidated by the
ACTU or the AFULE. Clearly, he felt that the union's rank
and file had a strong desire to maintain a separate identity
within a larger union of transport workers, with whom foot-
plate staff would share some common concerns.
Despite these differences, however, a 1991 LEDUWorking
Party Report on a proposed amalgamation of themselves with
the ARU and the Amalgamated Tramways and Motor
Omnibus Employees'Association (ATM) indicated that many
practical issues such as relocation of office staff and officials
would not present major difficulties. Yet there were some
complications. The ARU and the LEDU were State regis-
tered, while ATM was registered federally. It is significant
that members of ATM, the smallest and least well resourced
of the three, feared monopoly by the larger railway unions.
Some members objected to the union disposing of property
that had been acquired with contributions from the rank and
file. The loss of such assets was equated with a loss of union
identity and possibly also the loyalty that most members felt
toward their union (LEDU, 1991). Despite the optimism in
the 1991 Working Party report, the LEDU again reneged on
amalgamation, leaving the other two parties to create the
Australian RTBU (n.d.). The LEDU continued to seek a
merger with other WA unions.
Between 1991 and 1994, following the LEDU's decision
not to amalgamate, approximately 1,250 employees took
voluntary redundancy, leaving the union leadership fearing
that their union would be no longer viable (McPolin, 1994).
Other members decided individually to make the decision
that had been denied them en masse by joining the RTBU.
Yet other drivers left the government railway service
(Westrail) and joined the Commonwealth system (National
Rail), which meant transferring union membership to the
federal union, the Australian RTBU (R. Bergsma, interview
with the author, February 11, 2013).
In 1996, in controversial and divisive circumstances (Oliver,
2016), the union elected a new President, David Hathaway,
who strongly opposed amalgamation with the RTBU.
Hathaway stated that the union must continue to resist amal-
gamating with either the RTBU or the Australian Services
Union (ASU; "the old Right Wing Clerks'Union" as he termed
it). They should "hold together as enginemen" but, if amalga-
mation became a necessary, it would be better to "look to a
respectable blue collar Union" (Hathaway, 1996). Despite the
strong feelings against the ASU, the LEDU's Executive signed
a Memorandum of Understanding with this union in 1997. This
move did not please some of the membership, who objected
that railway officers "are not Enginemen's friends," and they
circulated a petition in September 1997 to reconsider the issue
of amalgamation with the RTBU (LEDU, 1997). The ASU
included in its coverage members of the former ROU. In this
particular instance, therefore, the strength of membership opin-
ion against the ASU influenced the direction the union's offi-
cials chose to take.
By this time, the State had experienced 4½ years of
industrial reform by the Liberal-National coalition govern-
ment of Premier Richard Court. The legislation replaced
existing award structures and centralized bargaining with
individual workplace agreements, some of which offered
only the most basic working conditions, curtailed workers'
6 SAGE Open
right to claim entitlements under the Workers'Compensation
Act, and eroded safety requirements (Oliver, 2003). Westrail
embarked on stringent rationalization measures to reduce
staff numbers and undermine working conditions as well as
putting workers' safety at risk, according to the Union.
Some members were pressured to sign individual workplace
agreements. It became clear that the LEDU could not pre-
vent the loss of conditions that had "taken 100 years to gain"
(Hathaway, 1997).
In mid 1998, the LEDU's centenary year, which should
have been a year of celebration, the membership voted on the
matter of "harmonization" of the LEDU and the RTBU. Only
360 ballot papers were issued, indicating that the member-
ship had more than halved since 1994 (LEDU, 1997). Of 217
completed ballots returned, over two thirds voted in favor of
amalgamation--but what of the more than one third of the
membership who did not bother to vote? Did they believe
that the result was a foregone conclusion and that their opin-
ion made no difference? The evidence from the union's files
is that former officials blamed the President, Hathaway, for
under mining the union's capacity to advocate strongly on
behalf of its members (e.g., Jarratt to Hathaway, 1997; Jarrett
to Hathaway, 1997). Hathaway, however, criticized the
branches for not giving the General Committee any guidance
or making their wishes known (Hathaway, 1997). The author
interviewed 22 former union members when researching the
union's history (Oliver, 2016). Not all expressed opinions
about the amalgamation, but some blamed the union's demise
on the division between officials in the Executive, especially
Hathaway, McPolin, and former Secretary Les Young. One
said that joining the RTBU was "the worst thing they did" (J.
Menegon, interview with the author, March 14, 2014) and
another that the officials' "putting the union down" weak-
ened its capacity to survive (V. Charushenko, interview with
the author, March 14, 2014).
The new union, theAustralian Rail,Tram and Bus Industrial
Union of Workers (WA Branch), was registered in the State
Industrial Relations Commission on March 12, 1999. The
LEDU rank and file feared that they would become a small,
neglected group within a union that now had responsibility for
most public transport drivers. Their fears were not unfounded.
From 2006, rail car drivers (many of whom were former
LEDU members) were placed under a different award from
TransWA drivers, which resulted in their receiving only about
75% of the pay of their colleagues. They felt abandoned by the
union but powerless to do anything. Paul Robinson, himself a
rail car driver, rectified this anomaly after he became State
Secretary of the RTBU (P. Robinson, interview with the
author, February 28, 2014). This incident indicates the need
for officials in "super unions" to be vigilant about the needs of
all of their members, not just those from their own trade or
section. In summary, the evidence suggests that the amalga-
mation of the LEDU with the RTBU, while it may have ben-
efited members in creating a viable union, was accompanied
by considerable bitterness, recrimination, and regret.
Conclusion
This article has not set out to draw conclusions about the full
extent of the impact of amalgamation on union rank and file
membership, which would be impossible with just one case
study. Rather, with the other contributions surveyed here, it
aims to begin to establish a literature of the ways that union
amalgamations do affect rank and file members, whether for
well or ill. In the case of the LEDU, it is difficult to ascertain
the extent to which becoming a mere division in a larger
union undermines the culture of being enginemen, because
that is not the only factor that has come into play. At least two
other factors are significant in the WesternAustralian context.
First, the large-scale privatization of industry has introduced
an aggressively anti-union culture into the rail industry, par-
ticularly from international companies such as Genesee &
Wyoming Inc.Australia (Oliver, 2014). Second, the system of
training engine drivers has changed significantly. Under the
WAGR/Westrail system, employees might take 20 years to
achieve the status of driver, so, not surprisingly it was sought
after, valued, and proudly held. Today, a person from a non-
railway background can be trained to be rail car driver in 6
months (N. Little, interview with the author, December 12,
2012; Robinson, 2014). The concept of "railway families"
with generations who worked for the WAGR has vanished.
Of the two WA unions compared in this article, the PKIU
members appear to have had a much clearer idea about the
benefits that could be accessed by belonging to a numerically
and politically powerful union. Moy (2008) found that both
officials and members saw advantages in "economies of
scale" (p. 25), legal resources, and bargaining power.
Negative effects, such as a fall in recruitment, have to be
seen in the light of the fact that most of the post-amalgama-
tion study has fallen either within the tenure of the Howard
Federal government (1996-2007), an era in which Australian
unions experienced the most sustained attacks since the
1920s, or that of its conservative Labor successors, Rudd
(2007-2010), Gillard (2010-2013), of which the latter was a
minority government dependent upon the support of
Independent members and the Australian Greens. The arbi-
tration system (which was once claimed to benefit the
worker) was completely re-shaped to re-emerge, in the post-
Howard era, as the Fair Work Commission--a body that
places considerable limitations upon what constitutes legal
union activity. The extent to which these changes impacted
negatively on union numbers and density in workforce is still
being determined (see, for example, Oliver, 2014).
Increasing membership numbers would be one indicator
that unions have regained the confidence of workers in the
industries that they cover, but accessing reliable figures,
even from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, appears to
be very difficult. Recent observations state that the per-
centage of unionized workers in Western Australia rose
from 14.3% in 2008 to 17% in 2010, but "plummeted" to
13.7% in 2014 (Amendola, 2009; "Union Membership
Oliver 7
Falling," 2014). Evidently, larger unions have a greater
capacity to offer services to members and provide more
adequate legal protection in times of adversity. Conversely,
larger numbers of rank and file are governed by smaller
groups of officials and action may be determined more by
ideology or political expediency than by responding to
what the rank and file wants.
As another major amalgamation is being contemplated
between two of Australia's largest and most militant unions,
the MUA and the Construction, Forestry, Minerals and
Energy Union, it is to be hoped that the sacrifices enforced
upon the rank and file by amalgamation are beginning to
yield the benefits anticipated by union officials, as enunci-
ated by Sheridan (1975) over 40 years ago: being "better
equipped to cope with the new era of industrial relations"
(p. 304). Certainly, those unionists back in 1975 could hardly
have envisaged the ravages that 21st century politics and
economics would inflict on the Australian union movement.
