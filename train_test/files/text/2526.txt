OBJECTIVE: To estimate how well a convenience sample
of women from the general population could self-screen
for contraindications to combined oral contraceptives
using a medical checklist.
METHODS: Women 18­49 years old (N1,271) were
recruited at two shopping malls and a flea market in El
Paso, Texas, and asked first whether they thought birth
control pills were medically safe for them. They then
used a checklist to determine the presence of level 3 or 4
contraindications to combined oral contraceptives ac-
cording to the World Health Organization Medical Eligi-
bility Criteria. The women then were interviewed by a
blinded nurse practitioner, who also measured blood
pressure.
RESULTS: The sensitivity of the unaided self-screen to
detect true contraindications was 56.2% (95% confidence
interval [CI] 51.7­60.6%), and specificity was 57.6% (95%
CI 54.0­61.1%). The sensitivity of the checklist to detect
true contraindications was 83.2% (95% CI 79.5­86.3%),
and specificity was 88.8% (95% CI 86.3­90.9%). Using the
checklist, 6.6% (95% CI 5.2­8.0%) of women incorrectly
thought they were eligible for use when, in fact, they
were contraindicated, largely because of unrecognized
hypertension. Seven percent (95% CI 5.4­8.2%) of
women incorrectly thought they were contraindicated
when they truly were not, primarily because of misclas-
sification of migraine headaches. In regression analysis,
younger women, more educated women, and Spanish
speakers were significantly more likely to correctly self-
screen (P<.05).
CONCLUSION: Self-screening for contraindications to
oral contraceptives using a medical checklist is relatively
accurate. Unaided screening is inaccurate and reflects
common misperceptions about the safety of oral contra-
ceptives. Over-the-counter provision of this method
likely would be safe, especially for younger women and if
independent blood pressure screening were encouraged.

LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II
Evidence from the 2002 National Survey of Family
Growth suggests that contraceptive use among
women at risk of unintended pregnancy has declined
in recent years.1 Limited access may contribute to
contraceptive nonuse, and the prescription require-
ment for hormonal methods may further deter initia-
tion and continuation.2 The public health benefits of
over-the-counter access to oral contraceptives have
been debated for years,3 and a recent study demon-
strated the acceptability and feasibility of pharmacist
provision of hormonal methods.4
One criterion for determining whether combined
oral contraceptives could be provided safely over-the-
counter is demonstrating that women can screen
themselves for medical contraindications to use. In

are easily available over-the-counter, women who
obtained their pills over-the-counter at pharmacies
had similar risk profiles to women who received pills
from clinics.5,6 Zavala et al found that women who
obtained pills from a community-based distribution
program had similar health profiles and prevalence of
risk factors compared with those who obtained their
pills from other locations, such as pharmacies.5 These
findings indicate that women who had not consulted
with a clinician were just as well-screened as those
women who had received a formal medical evalua-
tion. Another study used data from the Mexican
National Health Survey and compared the health
profiles and contraindications to oral contraceptive
use among women obtaining pills from pharmacies
and those who received pills from a public or private
clinic.6 Although women who obtained pills from
clinics had a lower prevalence of contraindications to
pill use than those who purchased their pills directly
from pharmacies, the differences between these
groups were not statistically significant. Furthermore,
the authors' analysis from the Mexican National
Survey of Reproductive Health showed that the ma-
jority of women (69.2%) who currently purchased oral
contraceptives at pharmacies had begun use under
medical supervision through a private doctor or pub-
lic clinic.6
In a recent study from Washington state, Shotor-
bani et al demonstrated that women's responses to a
medical eligibility checklist for hormonal contracep-
tives were just as accurate as a provider's formal
evaluation.7 In an item-by-item analysis, agreement
ranged from 84% to 100% between a woman's self-
assessment and the provider's assessment of whether
she had a given contraindication. Furthermore, the
authors showed that where women and providers
disagreed, women were more likely to report contra-
indications than were providers. Of note, fewer than
5% of the women in this study were judged to be
contraindicated to hormonal contraceptive use.7
Although these studies demonstrate the general
effectiveness of women to screen themselves for con-
traindications to oral contraceptive use, the popula-
tions studied were restricted to women already using
hormonal contraception or accessing family planning
services. Therefore, it is possible that women who had
already screened themselves out of oral contraceptive
use were not included. In this study, we surveyed both
oral contraceptive users and nonusers to reduce the
possibility of selection bias.
The purpose of this study was to estimate the
accuracy of a woman's self-assessment regarding
whether she was contraindicated to oral contracep-
tive use among a convenience sample in the general
population. The self-assessment first was performed
unaided and then repeated using a simple medical-
screening checklist. The gold standard to which
these assessments were compared was an assess-
ment by a nurse practitioner.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was part of the Border Contraceptive
Access Study, a 5-year project examining oral contra-
ceptive use along the U.S.­Mexican border. Between
May and July 2006, bilingual (English/Spanish) fe-
male interviewers approached women in two shop-
ping malls and an outdoor flea market in El Paso,
Texas, and invited them to participate in the study.
Women between 18 and 49 years of age and able to
complete the interview in English or Spanish were
eligible to participate. Information on refusal to par-
ticipate was not collected, but study staff reported that
very few women declined to participate in the survey.
Interviewers asked women about basic sociode-
mographic information as well as about their current
contraceptive use. Women who were not current
hormonal contraceptive users were asked whether
they thought the pill would be an appropriate birth
control choice given their medical history and regard-
less of their intent to use this method. We assumed
that current hormonal contraceptive users would con-
sider pill use safe for them and therefore did not ask
them the question.
Next, all women were given a checklist of medi-
cal contraindications to combined oral contraceptive
use and were asked to check whether they had one or
more of the listed conditions. The checklist was based
on the World Health Organization (WHO) Medical
Eligibility Criteria for relative and absolute contrain-
dications to combined oral contraceptives (category 3
and 4 contraindications)8 and was based on an instru-
ment that previously had been validated.7 We did not
include conditions that are considered category 2
contraindications because the WHO states that in
situations with limited clinical judgment it is reason-
able to use the method when an individual has such a
contraindication. The questions included in the
checklist are listed in the Box.
Immediately after completing the questionnaire,
women were screened by a nurse practitioner who
was blinded to the woman's responses in the inter-
view. One of five female nurse practitioners evaluated
each woman who completed a questionnaire. The
clinician's screening instrument included, in addition
to background demographic information, a medical
history that focused on WHO category 3 and 4

contraindications. The nurse practitioner also mea-
sured and recorded the respondent's blood pressure
either manually or using an automated Omron HEM-
705CP blood pressure monitor (Omron Healthcare,
Inc., Bannockburn, IL). Blood pressure was measured
twice, and the mean systolic and mean diastolic
measurements were recorded. Based on this informa-
tion, the nurse practitioner determined whether the
respondent was contraindicated to oral contraceptive
use or not. If the provider felt that additional tests or
evaluation were necessary before prescribing pills, the
respondent was classified as contraindicated.
For their participation, women received a $5­$10
gift card valid for use at the shopping center or flea
market. The study was approved by the institutional
review boards of the University of Texas at Austin
and the University of Texas at El Paso. We obtained
verbal informed consent from all participants.
Questionnaire data were entered into a Microsoft
Access (Redmond, WA) database and analyzed using
Stata 9.2 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). Univa-
riable descriptive statistics were generated to char-
acterize the study participants and to describe the
overall distribution of responses. We used the
point-estimate and 95% confidence interval (CI) to
measure the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and
negative predictive values of the self-assessments
(with and without the contraindication checklist).
Ninety-five percent CIs for the sensitivity and
specificity measurements were calculated according
to the efficient-score method.9 The McNemar 2
test was used to assess whether participants were
equally likely to incorrectly self-report a contrain-
dication as to incorrectly self-report eligibility for
pill use. We used logistic regression to model the
outcome variable of interest (participant­provider
agreement) and to estimate agreement among sub-
groups defined by age, language preference, edu-
cation, parity, and contraceptive use.
Based on data from the 1998 National Health
Interview Survey, we estimated that approximately
15% of women of reproductive age in the general
population are contraindicated for oral contraceptive
use.10 For this study, we sought to estimate whether
1% of the population or more might falsely believe
that oral contraceptives are appropriate for them
when, in fact, they are medically contraindicated. We
determined that a sample size of 1,200 would give us
a 95% CI of this measurement of 0.6%.
RESULTS
A total of 1,271 women agreed to participate. Table 1
shows the demographic characteristics of the study
participants according to their self-screening status
using the checklist. The participants, on average, were
in their early 30s, had completed 13 years of school-
ing, and had between one and two children. The
sample was overwhelmingly Latina, and the majority
primarily spoke Spanish or were bilingual. Four out of
five of the respondents lived in the United States, and
two thirds had completed their schooling in the
United States. In total, the nurse practitioners found
that 39.3% (95% CI 36.6­42.0%) of respondents were
medically contraindicated to oral contraceptive use.
The prevalence of contraindications varied by age;
among women age 18 to 34 (n728), the contrain-
dication prevalence was 31.3% (95% CI 27.9­
34.7%), whereas it was 45.1% (95% CI 39.9­50.3%)
among women age 35 to 44 (n357) and 59.5%
(95% CI 52.3­66.6%) among women age 45 and
older (n185). No adverse events were observed
during the study.
Table 2 shows the prevalence of each individ-
ual contraindication identified by the nurse practi-
tioners. The most prevalent contraindications were
migraine with aura (17.6%) and hypertension of
140/90 mm Hg or greater (14.5%). Women's self-
assessments of contraindications varied from 47.8%
(95% CI 45.1­50.6%) for the initial self-screen
(Table 3) to 39.5% (95% CI 36.8­42.2%) using the
self-screening checklist (Table 4).

Regarding the accuracy of the initial screening
question, 660 respondents (52.2%) said the pill was
medically safe for them, and 604 (47.8%) said it was
unsafe or they were not sure. As shown in Table 3,
this initial screening question demonstrated poor ac-
curacy compared with the clinician screen. The over-
all sensitivity of the initial self-screen to detect a true
contraindication was 56.0% (95% CI 51.5­60.4%),
and the specificity was 57.6% (95% CI 54.0­61.1%).
The positive predictive value of the initial self-screen
was 46.2% (95% CI 42.2­50.3%), and the negative
predictive value was 66.8% (95% CI 63.1­70.4%). The
McNemar 2 result indicates that respondents were
significantly more likely to incorrectly assess them-
selves as contraindicated with the initial self-screen
than to assess themselves eligible when they were not.
The accuracy of self-screening for contraindications
using the medical checklist compared with the clinician
screen is presented in Table 4. The sensitivity of the
self-screening checklist to detect a true contraindication
was 83.2% (95% CI 79.5­86.3%), and the specificity was
88.8% (95% CI 86.3­90.9%). The positive predictive
value of self-screening using the checklist was 82.8%
(95% CI 79.2­86.0%), and the negative predictive value
was 89.0% (95% CI 86.6­91.1%). Eighty-six women
(6.8%) using the checklist considered themselves contra-

indicated for pill use, when, in fact, the provider deter-
mined they were eligible. On the other hand, a similar
number, 84 women (6.6%, 95% CI 5.2­8.0%), failed to
identify a true medical contraindication using the check-
list. According to the McNemar 2 test, there was no
significant difference between the proportion incorrectly
self-reporting a contraindication using the checklist and
the proportion incorrectly self-reporting eligibility for
pill use. Participants who did not understand a question
on the medical checklist left it blank, and these re-
sponses were treated as missing values. Overall, self-
screening or clinician-screening data were missing for
three participants. Participants for whom data were
missing were excluded from analyses requiring those
responses.
Agreement between the respondent's self-screen
and the clinician screen was 98% or higher for each of
the individual contraindications except for two. In the
case of hypertension, 9% of the respondents were found
to be hypertensive (systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg
or higher or diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or
higher) and did not know this to be the case. With
regard to migraine headaches, 6% of the respondents
believed their condition made them ineligible to use the
pill, but the nurse practitioner did not assess their
migraine as one involving aura, which is the true
contraindication.
We used logistic regression models to assess the
association between selected demographic character-
istics (including age, education, language spoken at
home, recruitment site, parity, and contraceptive use)
and respondents' incorrect self-assessment of one or
more contraindications to pill use. The coefficients in
these models indicate that women age 35 and older
had significantly higher odds of incorrectly self-re-
porting that they were eligible for pill use compared
with younger women (P.05). Participants reporting
Spanish as their primary language had lower odds of
incorrectly reporting that they were eligible for pill
use compared with English-speaking women (P.05).
In addition, women who had completed at least some
college education had lower odds of incorrectly re-
porting that they were contraindicated to oral contra-
ceptive use compared with those with less education
(P.05). Neither parity nor contraceptive use were
significantly associated with the odds of either incor-
rectly reporting contraindications or incorrectly re-
porting pill eligibility. (Regression models not shown
but available on request).

prevalence that seems surprisingly high. Shortridge and
Miller examined the prevalence of contraindications to
combined oral contraceptives in the U.S. general popu-
lation using data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) and found that 16% of
fecund females aged 10 to 51 were contraindicated to
oral contraceptives.11 Only nine contraindicated dis-
eases were recorded in the NHANES dataset, and
several prevalent conditions such as migraine with aura
were not identifiable. The study from Washington
found that, among women presenting to a family
planning clinic, 4.6% were contraindicated to hor-
monal contraceptive use.7 Although it is certainly
surprising that the prevalence of contraindications is
10-fold larger in our sample, there are important
differences between our study and the report from
Washington. Eighty-eight percent of the women in
the Washington study were seeking hormonal contra-
ception, and 90% were between the ages of 15 and
30.7 Our population was older, which increases the
likelihood of being contraindicated to oral contracep-
tives, and a smaller proportion was using hormonal
contraception, suggesting they were less likely to have
been previously screened for contraindications. The
prevalence of contraindications reported here is closer
to that reported using data from a national health survey
in Mexico,6 although, like the report based on the
NHANES data, that study was not able to include
migraine with aura as a contraindication.
A simple question asking a woman whether she
thought the pill was medically safe for her served as a
poor screening test for being contraindicated to oral
contraceptive use. Using a medical checklist of contra-
indications, women were more accurate in their self-
assessments. One way to evaluate screening tests,
known as Youden's J, involves adding the positive
predictive and negative predictive values and subtract-
ing one.12 This value for the initial self-screening ques-
tion is 0.13, indicating poor accuracy that scarcely
improves on a coin toss, whereas it is 0.72 for screening
using the medical checklist, indicating much better--
although not perfect--accuracy. However, it is important
to remember that a screening test's positive and negative
predictive values are dependent on the prevalence of
the condition in the population screened.13 The popula-
tion studied here had a high prevalence of contraindi-
cations, and it may be that self-screening using the
medical checklist would have lower positive and nega-
tive predictive values in a population with a lower
prevalence of contraindications.
The main conditions that contributed to being
contraindicated to oral contraceptives were hyperten-
sion, migraine with aura, and smoking over age 34. It
is important to note that only the first condition is
possibly unknowable to the woman. In the case of
migraine with aura, we found that women were more
likely to self-screen themselves out of oral contraceptive
use when, in fact, the nurse practitioner assessed that the
respondent's headaches did not contraindicate pill use, a
finding that has been reported previously.7
Some women were found to be better at self-
screening than others. Younger women were better
than older women, largely because older women
were more likely to have unrecognized hypertension.
More educated women also were found to be more
accurate self-screeners. Interestingly, a study of data
from Mexico found that women who obtained oral
contraceptives over-the-counter were more educated
than those who obtained pills from a clinic.6 Our
findings that Spanish speakers were more accurate at
self-screening also merits further investigation.
How accurate does self-screening need to be to be
considered "good enough"? It is unlikely that any
screening assessment for contraindications will be 100%
sensitive and specific, and even clinician screening ap-
pears to be flawed. The study based on data from the
NHANES found that 6% of current pill users in the
United States actually were contraindicated for use11
even though the prescription requirement mandates
clinician screening. Another study using mystery clients

in Mexico found that few women seeking pills were
appropriately screened for contraindications using evi-
dence-based criteria.14 Although our study reports on a
different population, our finding that 6.6% of women
incorrectly thought they were appropriate for pill use
when, in fact, they were contraindicated is remarkably
similar to the proportion of pill users incorrectly
screened by clinicians in the NHANES study.11
This study had several limitations. The convenience
sample used here was not representative of the general
population, and the results may not be generalizeable to
other populations. In particular, it is likely that the
population from which this sample was drawn is less
likely to undergo routine health maintenance screening
and therefore more likely to have unrecognized hyper-
tension. In addition, although we aimed to evaluate the
accuracy of self-screening in the general population, our
results cannot be extrapolated to a population seeking
hormonal contraception, which likely is younger and
has a lower prevalence of contraindications. Further-
more, several factors likely led to the over-diagnosis of
contraindications. The nurse practitioners used a study
instrument that forced them to evaluate for the presence
of every category 3 or 4 contraindication, and this
evaluation was likely much more rigorous that the
typical evaluation of a woman seeking contraception in
a clinic. In addition, a diagnosis of hypertension cannot
be based on a single measurement, and at least some
cases of elevated blood pressure may have been "white
coat" hypertension. Finally, most of the nurse practitio-
ners had minimal experience prescribing hormonal
contraception and generally erred toward requesting fur-
ther evaluation (which led to a participant being catego-
rized as contraindicated) if they were not confident that
oral contraceptive use was safe for a given condition.
Overall, these findings suggest that women can,
by and large, accurately self-screen for contraindica-
tions to pill use using a checklist of contraindications.
Moreover, women who are likely to seek contracep-
tion--especially younger women--are able to identify
conditions that might make oral contraceptive use
dangerous. If anything, self-screening may eliminate
more people as appropriate candidates than clinician
screening. In an over-the-counter environment, how-
ever, women who want to use the pill and find that
they are contraindicated by self-screening likely
would seek the counsel of a clinician rather than
deciding definitively that the method is dangerous for
them. It is also possible that a truly contraindicated
woman who is very motivated to use oral contracep-
tives might ignore the results of her self-screening and
use the method regardless, much as a woman might
conceal elements of her medical history, such as
smoking, from a clinician to obtain a prescription for
pills. An actual-use study of oral contraceptives pro-
vided in a simulated over-the-counter setting is
needed to answer these remaining questions.
