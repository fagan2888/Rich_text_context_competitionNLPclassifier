Article
Much has been written during the past two decades about
ethical consumption and the way consumers' ethical views
toward the commodities they purchase stand in contradiction
to their actual consumption behavior. Some scholars attempt
to explain the "gap" between consumers' attitudes and
behavior (Bray, Johns, & Kilburn, 2011; Carrigan & Attalla,
2001; Carrington, Neville, & Whitwell, 2010). Other schol-
ars have asked whether consumers bear responsibility for
purchasing unethically produced commodities (Barrera,
2011; Schwartz, 2010). In this article, I approach this topic
from a normative standpoint. My aim is to distinguish among
the myriad types of ignorance that consumers manifest
toward the commodities they consume. The article is philo-
sophical in intent and undertakes a conceptual analysis of the
conditions under which consumers' ignorance may be
deemed culpable. What follows not only draws on philo-
sophical work on ignorance and culpability but also contrib-
utes to such work by refining aspects of it and applying it to
a topic hitherto neglected by philosophical research, namely,
consumption. The conceptual work, though philosophical in
nature, reaches beyond a philosophical audience because it
provides a framework for future empirical work into the eth-
ics of consumption. Although highly enlightening, empirical
work on ethical consumption has heretofore lacked a clear
analytical framework with which to differentiate the multi-
faceted forms of unethical consumption behavior. This arti-
cle suggests such a framework, one which will relate
empirical study of ethical consumption to the normative con-
cerns of moral philosophy.
What is an unethically produced commodity? The ethical
criterion I use for a commodity's being unethically produced
is that its production involves harm or injustice being
inflicted on innocent parties. Innocent parties are numerous
and include
i. fellow humans beings, for example, sweatshop labor-
ers who produce commodities or farm laborers who
are exposed to toxic chemicals when they harvest
crops destined for the market;
ii. future human beings, for example, those to whom we
will bequeath depleted and inadequate environmental
resources as a result of our consumption choices;
iii. non-human animals, for example, those kept under
detrimental conditions and turned into feed for
humans, or those on whom cosmetics are tested.
These categories are not exhaustive; some people, for
instance, would include plant life among those parties that
human economic activity harms. The examples I discuss in
this article reveal the diversity of innocent parties, and I will
not add to the categories of innocent parties here. More
important, by way of introduction, is to clarify the wrongful-
ness involved in purchasing unethically produced commodi-
ties and its relationship to ignorance and culpability.
Purchasing unethically produced commodities is wrong-
ful because of the harm it causes to others or the injustices
that are perpetuated through purchasing such commodities.
Consumers are usually not the direct perpetrators of these
harms and injustices; the latter are more often perpetrated by
businesses that produce the commodities in question.
Consumers are nevertheless implicated in the harm and injus-
tice that extend along the value chains along which commodi-
ties travel. They are implicated in the sense that their decisions

Market Processes and the Ethics of
Consumption
Mark Peacock1
Abstract
Consumers are often implicated in unjust economic practices when they purchase commodities produced in ethically
unacceptable ways. Consumers are, however, ignorant about the production of many of the commodities which leads to
these unwitting consumption of unethically produced commodities. This article asks whether consumers are culpable for
their ignorance about the unethical commodities they purchase.

to purchase such commodities contribute to the profitability
of corporations that perpetrate harms and injustices.
Consumers are therefore a causal force in sustaining unethi-
cal business practices. Consumers are often ignorant of these
harms and injustices, and the question at the core of this
study is "Under which circumstances does consumers' igno-
rance absolve them of culpability for the existence of wrongs
for which they are partly causally responsible on account of
their purchase of unethically produced commodities?" By
focusing on consumers in this article, I do not intend to
deflect attention from the culpability of corporations (or of
governments) for their role in the existence of unethically
produced commodities. My enquiry into consumers' culpa-
bility should not therefore be interpreted to imply that con-
sumers alone bear responsibility for the persistence of
unethical economic practices. Rather, my aim is to theorize,
from an ethical point of view, the role of consumers in the
persistence of such practices and how consumers can act to
reduce or avoid culpability.
The structure of the article is as follows. The section
"Market Processes and the Division of Knowledge," gives an
account of how markets function which turns on the notion of
ignorance. This "Austrian" account of market processes holds
that a merit of the market is its epistemological modesty. The
claim is that markets function relatively well despite market
participants' ignorance about many characteristics of the
commodities they buy and the processes through which they
are produced. Market participants can therefore economize
on knowledge about market processes while remaining able
to make rational economic decisions on a slim epistemologi-
cal foundation. Consumers'lack of knowledge about the con-
ditions under which commodities are produced means,
however, that they often lack information necessary for mak-
ing ethical consumption decisions. In the section
"Preliminaries and Caveats," I clarify a few preliminaries and
caveats to explain why I focus on consumers' culpability
rather than that of corporations or governments. The norma-
tiveanalysisbeginsinthesection"IgnoranceandCulpability,"
in which I ask whether the notion of "affected ignorance"
(Moody-Adams, 1997) provides a good depiction of consum-
ers' role in unethical market practices. If it is, it follows that
consumers' ignorance is culpable. My discussion leads me to
draw a number of distinctions within the category of igno-
rance and its culpable nature. In the section "Degrees of
Culpability," I consider circumstances that might lessen the
degree of culpability we ascribe to consumers for being igno-
rant, and the section "Precepts for Ethical Consumption,"
contains precepts to guide ethical consumption.
Market Processes and the Division of
Knowledge
The knowledge argument in Austrian economic theory is
multifaceted (Hayek, 1935/1963, 1945; Kirzner, 1992). For
the purpose of this article, I look at one aspect of the argument
that concerns the division and dissemination of knowledge in
a market economy and its relevance for consumers' deci-
sions. This allows me to take up the argument of the follow-
ing section which considers the knowledge necessary for
consuming ethically.
Consider the following situation of a consumer:
Food reaches his local supermarket through processes of which
he is probably ignorant, if not misinformed. He lives in a home
constructed by an involved process whose technical, economic,
and political intricacies are barely suspected, much less known
to him. His home is likely to be stocked with many devices
working on mechanical and technical principles which he
neither understands theoretically nor can cope with as a practical
matter. (Sowell, 1980, p. 7)
Our ignorance of the details of products we consume is
not a barrier to our ability to make serviceable decisions
because much information is conveyed to us in the form of
relative prices. If the price of an item of food falls relative to
those of other foodstuffs, a consumer can buy more of this
food and economize on other items. She does not need to
know about the technical development in farming methods
which has brought about the reduction in price to make a
rational consumption decision. This applies to businesses
that use this food in their production processes, for example,
restaurants. If, for instance, the price of a particular olive oil
falls, restaurateurs can substitute relatively more expensive
olive (and other) oils with this cheaper rival. Why the price of
a particular type of olive oil has fallen is not something res-
taurant owners need to know; that a supplier of olive oil has
offered them this cheaper variety suffices, and the technical
development in olive cultivation in Turkey, which has caused
the fall in price, is something of which they may remain
ignorant. The decision of a restaurant owner to use the
cheaper oil can be conveyed to consumers in the form of
lower priced meals. The consumer, too, is ignorant of what
has gone on upward in the supply chain to make the price of
meals at this particular restaurant cheaper. But what occurred
in Turkey to reduce the price of olives is communicated to
market participants in the form of price information. And the
knowledge that led to the technical development in Turkish
agriculture, and which might be known in all its details only
to a few agricultural scientists, becomes dispersed in the
market, although the market participants who benefit from
the technical development know nothing of its details but
only its effects on prices. One such group of market partici-
pants are consumers whose knowledge seldom extends to the
technical details of production, the source of raw materials,
the modes of transport involved in conveying goods to retail-
ers, or to the activities of the corporations in whose name
commodities are produced. In fact, there are innumerable
details of the genealogy of commodities of which consumers
are typically ignorant. This has implications for consumers
who wish to consume ethically.
Consider the following examples:
Peacock 3
1. The wedding ring on my finger hails from South
America where a mining corporation has developed a
new mining technique that allows it to undercut
competitors.
2. The T-shirt I wear was made in southeast Asia at a
low price that reflects an innovative personnel policy
used by a textile factory.
3. The price of beef falls thanks to a change in institu-
tional conditions in the Amazon Basin.
There is much about which consumers of wedding rings,
T-shirts, and beef are ignorant in such examples. Let us fill in
a few details:
Ad (1) The new mining technique involves the detonation
of explosives which removes the summits of mountains
and exposes the ore that can be mined cheaply. This
causes environmental damage, leaving the landscape
scarred and the water table polluted, thus causing a short-
age of fresh water on which many communities depend.
Ad (2) The innovative personnel policy consists of out-
lawing workers' associations and collective bargaining, a
measure passed by a military government and enforced by
the army that has a permanent presence in textile facto-
ries. This ensures a cheap and disciplined labor force.
Ad (3) The price of beef has fallen due to the conversion
of forest land to cattle farming. This causes deforestation
and is enabled by the government having granted property
rights on the hitherto "unowned" land to large cattle farm-
ing corporations. These farmers clear the land of aborigi-
nal communities who have lived on it for generations
without having a formal title to the land; members of such
communities who resist and organize protest against cat-
tle farmers are intimidated and forced from the land; some
lose their lives.
In example (1), consumers benefit from the knowledge of
the mining innovation when they purchase a wedding ring,
yet they have no direct knowledge of how the ore is mined.
The mining technique will have given the mining corporation
a competitive advantage that is reflected in a lower relative
price of rings. It is through such relative price differentials,
not through direct knowledge of the innovation itself, that
consumers are alerted to the existence of the new mining
technique. If consumers possessed such knowledge, many
would not buy rings because they hold their mode of produc-
tion to be unethical. Such examples reveal that consumers'
ignorance of market processes can lead them to purchase
commodities of which they would not approve ethically were
they to know more about them. That is, because of their igno-
rance, consumers are implicated in the perpetuation of injus-
tices in the supply chain. By purchasing such commodities,
consumers commit wrongdoing because they are ignorant
about these commodities. Whether they are blameworthy for
doing so depends on whether their ignorance is culpable.
Preliminaries and Caveats
Before diving into the theme of consumer ignorance and cul-
pability, I clarify some limitations I draw around my analy-
sis. First, many people lay the blame for unethical market
practices at the door of corporations that produce commodi-
ties unethically. "If only corporations were to produce ethi-
cally, consumers would not need to worry about purchasing
unethical products," one might say. This is a cogent argu-
ment, and ethical-consumer activism should indeed draw
attention to corporate misdemeanors as a means to outlawing
the malfeasance of business. Often, corporations only
improve their ethical record when it is revealed that their
business practice transgresses ethical norms. Corporations'
attempts to "conceal their sourcing practices" (Oxfam, 2013,
p. 33) represent a barrier to consumers who wish to over-
come their ignorance about corporations' practices. Without
wishing to make light of the ethical dubiety of many corpo-
rate practices, I take the existence of such malfeasance as a
regrettable fact of life for the foreseeable future. The ques-
tion regarding consumers then becomes "Given the existence
of unethically made products, is consumers' ignorance about
these products culpable, even if other actors, namely corpo-
rations, are the primary perpetrators of injustices committed
in the production process?" The discussion that follows,
then, is a contribution to "non-ideal theory" (Rawls, 2001, p.
13). That is, I am considering a market society that is not
"well-ordered" in the sense that not everyone--certainly not
every corporation--"strictly complies" with widely accepted
ethical principles regarding commodity production.
The non-ideality of my analysis applies also to govern-
ment. Government, some people hold, is responsible for pun-
ishing unethical corporate practices. If government carried
out this task perfectly, consumers would not be in a position
in which they would have the option of consuming unethi-
cally produced commodities, for government would prohibit
the sale of all such commodities. In this way, government
could divest consumers of the moral burden they currently
face, namely, the burden of deciding whether to become
more informed about commodities with a view to cease pur-
chasing those of an ethically dubious nature. Governments,
however, do not ban the production or sale of all unethically
produced commodities, nor can they realistically be expected
to do so. One reason for this is that consumers hold ethical
values which governments wish not to endorse legislatively.
Consumers, for instance, who find the slaughter of animals
morally unacceptable will hope in vain that government will
prohibit the sale of meat, for a broad consensus on this policy
does not appear to exist. The moral burden of whether to
consume meat remains, therefore, in the judgment of each
consumer. However vigilant a government might be in pass-
ing and enforcing laws about consumer goods, the law will
never correspond exactly to any consumer's ethical values.
This gap between law and a consumer's ethical values will
always mean that the ethical burden cannot be carried by
government alone.
4 SAGE Open
Government can nevertheless fulfill a different role that
falls short of prohibiting ethically unacceptable of commodi-
ties, namely, providing information about commodities so
that consumers can make informed purchasing decisions.
This is precisely what government does when it insists that
nutritional information be provided about the foods we con-
sume or when it decrees that imported items carry a "Made
in _____" label. Such information can serve as a fillip to
ethical consumption, for it gives consumers access to infor-
mation, which allows them to make ethical consumption
decisions. A proponent of ethical consumption should, cer-
tainly, support further-reaching informational policies and
hold accountable a government that did not provide informa-
tion with which consumers could fully assess the ethical con-
stitution of commodities.
A further limitation on government concerns international
treaties. A member state of the European Union (EU), for
instance, must uphold the "country of origin principle"
whereby corporations that export goods to any EU state must
comply with the regulations of their home country only, not
with those of other EU states in which their goods are sold.
This limits, say, the Irish government's power to outlaw
products made in Slovakia which the Irish populace deems
ethically unseemly. Whether European governments made
an ethically defensible decision when they agreed to the
country of origin principle does not fall within the purview
of this article, but the existence of the principle creates an
ethical onus for consumers whose government may not ban
commodities that its citizens find ethically unacceptable.
This is a further aspect of the non-ideal world the consumer
inhabits.
Ignorance and Culpability
The processes of production through which commodities are
created are often unethical. One reason such processes per-
sist is because consumers are ignorant of their details.
Consumers' ignorance is thus a causal factor for the exis-
tence of unethically produced commodities and this causal
role leads us to ask how much responsibility consumers bear
for their ignorance that perpetuates unethical business prac-
tices. Under some circumstances, ignorance excuses a per-
son who performs a wrongful act. This section enquires into
the extent of the culpability of consumers' ignorance which
leads them to undertake wrongful acts of consumption.
Let us start the discussion by attending to Michele Moody-
Adams' notion "affected ignorance" as a basis for exploring
consumers' ignorance. Consider two examples:
1. Actively shielding oneself from others'knowledge so
as to remain isolated from the consequences of
actions in which one is involved. Moody-Adams
offers the example of the CEO of an investment bank
who instructs her staff to increase profits but insists
that they not inform her about their means of doing so
(and about the "potential wrongdoings" they commit
in carrying out the CEO's instruction).
2. Not acknowledging one's own fallibility, e.g. a uni-
versity administrator who declines to investigate
charges of misconduct against a colleague because
the latter "`couldn't possibly' be guilty of sexual
harassment" (Moody-Adams, 1994, pp. 301-302).
Of what are the CEO and the university administrator
ignorant in these examples? Using a distinction drawn by
Allen Buchanan (1996), we may distinguish two types of
ignorance, each of which may account for a person's wrong-
doing. The first type is factual ignorance, when a person
lacks the factual basis for judging the nature of a particular
situation. Buchanan draws his distinction in a study of human
radiation experiments conducted in the United States from
the 1940s to the 1970s in which civilians were exposed to
harmful radiation by government-sponsored scientists. If,
arguendo, we suppose that the scientific knowledge of the
day led scientists who conducted experiments to judge the
risk to subjects of these experiments to be non-existent, we
would absolve the scientists of culpability for their actions.
Their actions, to be sure, were wrong because they harmed
experimental subjects; but the fact that they would have
acted in the faith that they were not harming their subjects
lessens the culpability of their acts. Buchanan's second type
of ignorance is moral ignorance whereby a person is "unable
to discern what he ought to do because he is unable to make
certain moral distinctions" (Buchanan, 1996, p. 28). A per-
son is morally ignorant when she cannot ascertain what is
right and what wrong in the way that other people can. For
instance, if I break a promise, believing that there is nothing
wrong in doing so, I am morally ignorant about the right
course of action.
Returning to Moody-Adams' two examples, the igno-
rance of the CEO and the university administrator is better
interpreted not as moral but as factual; they are ignorant
about morally relevant facts, but their moral sense itself is
not faulty.1 If the CEO knew about her staff's methods, be
they fraudulent, threatening, and so forth, for increasing
profits, she would presumably be morally disturbed; her
request not to be informed about these methods makes little
sense without this assumption. The university administrator
fails to investigate the allegations against his colleague, not
because he finds sexual harassment harmless, but because he
finds it incredible that his colleague could be guilty of sexual
harassment. This description makes it clear that the adminis-
trator holds sexual harassment to be execrable. Although the
CEO and the administrator share a factual type of ignorance,
their ignorance differs in a way to which I now turn.
The CEO is aware that her staff will use dubious means to
increase company profits; this explains her instruction to
them to keep their knowledge of these means to themselves.
Through her instructions, the CEO actively cultivates her
state of ignorance: She is ignorant of the details of her staff's
Peacock 5
doings, yet she knows there is something--probably morally
distasteful--of which she wishes to remain ignorant. (In a
different context, Donald Rumsfeld described such doings as
"known unknowns"). The CEO's ignorance corresponds to
Moody-Adams' (1997) definition of affected ignorance as
involving "a choice not to know something that is morally
important" (p. 102) or, in an earlier formulation, "choosing
not to know what one can and should know" and thereby
committing or perpetuating injustice (Moody-Adams, 1994,
p. 296). The CEO's awareness of the (probably immoral)
methods to be used by her staff presents her with two options:
(a) investigating these methods and (b) remaining ignorant
about them. She opts for (b), but her awareness of option (a)
means that she is making a choice. The CEO's position is
like that of the doctor who crops up in many philosophical
writings on culpable ignorance (e.g., Montmarquet, 1995;
Smith, 1983). The doctor has not kept up with innovations in
his field as disseminated in medical journals; "he is aware
that he should read a certain article, yet decides . . . to take
the risk of not reading it" (Montmarquet, 1995. p. 45). The
doctor is aware that the article might contain something of
relevance but he decides not to read it and thereby risks
inflicting deleterious consequences on his patients.
Compare this with the university administrator. He is fac-
tually unaware of any wrongdoing on his colleague's part,
but unlike the CEO, he does not actively cultivate his igno-
rance. By not acknowledging the fallibility of his opinion,
the administrator does not deliberately keep himself in the
dark about the facts of the matter; rather it simply does not
strike him as possible that his colleague could be involved in
such sordid affairs. The administrator, therefore, does not
choose to remain ignorant about a morally important fact of
which he is more or less aware; for, to make a choice, the
administrator would have to be aware that an investigation
into the allegation might reveal the colleague's misconduct,
but this is precisely what the administrator cannot entertain.
The administrator's case is therefore not one of affected
ignorance if, following Moody-Adams, affected ignorance
requires that one make a choice not to apprise oneself of facts
which one could find out. The administrator's position is like
that of the doctor who has not kept up with innovations in his
field, though in a different scenario from that of the previous
paragraph. In this second scenario, the doctor does not read
the article in the medical journal because he considers read-
ing the journal in which it appears unnecessary for those in
his field (perhaps he thinks that significant innovations in
medicine are published only in more prestigious journals).
The doctor does not think it feasible that the journal in ques-
tion could carry an article of any significance.
The two previous paragraphs issue in what I call the
awareness condition for culpable ignorance:
Awareness condition: For an agent's ignorance to be
deemed culpable, the agent must be aware that, by main-
taining her state of ignorance, there exists a risk that some
morally undesirable state of affairs will arise or be per-
petuated through her actions.2
An agent who fulfills the awareness condition makes a
choice between remaining ignorant or enlightening herself
about the details of the case. The CEO does, but the adminis-
trator does not, fulfill this condition.
We have thus distinguished two types of factual igno-
rance: one is when the ignorant person is aware--perhaps
dimly--that he or she is ignorant of something and chooses
to maintain or propagate his or her ignorance; in the other
type, the ignorant person is unaware that there is anything
about which he or she is ignorant (these matters correspond
to Donald Rumsfeld's "unknown unknowns"); such a person
does not choose to be ignorant but simply is ignorant. Each
type of factual ignorance leads to a particular normative con-
clusion about a person who is thus ignorant. Let us begin
with the first type.
The CEO is ignorant of facts which, because of their moral
significance, might lead her, were she to be cognizant of
them, to assess a situation as morally dubious. She should be
censured for willfully maintaining her ignorance instead of
scrupulously overseeing her staff's activities and stipulating
in advance that their methods be above board.3 Her self-culti-
vated ignorance is culpable. The university administrator, by
contrast, does not cultivate his ignorance but simply is igno-
rant in that he has no suspicion that wrongdoing could be
afoot. We might be inclined to be lenient on such a person
because, unlike the CEO, he does not actively cultivate his
ignorance. But he might nevertheless be condemned for not
entertaining the merest suspicion that potentially disquieting
matters are afoot. One might say the administrator should be
aware of the possibility that there is substance to the allega-
tions, and that he should, therefore, investigate them. Let us
ask what light the foregoing sheds on consumers' ignorance.
Affected Ignorance and Consumers' Behavior
If it can be argued that consumers affect their ignorance of
the injustices perpetrated in the production of the commodi-
ties they consume, their ignorance is culpable. By viewing
the matter through the lens of affected ignorance, we direct
attention toward some types of consumer but not others.
Bracketed from the following analysis are, for instance,
"moral backsliders." A moral backslider (Hare, 1965) is an
agent who knows the morally correct course of action but
knowingly refrains from following it. He or she commits
wrongdoing in awareness that his or her act is wrongful. In
the realm of consumption, many people, I suspect, purchase
commodities knowing full well that they are unethical. The
consumer who said the following about his or her consump-
tion of fair-trade products probably falls into this category:
"I've thought some times that I should be more ethical in
what I buy . . . but part of me is quite lazy actually"
(Chatzidakis, Hibbert, & Smith, 2007, p. 92). The authors of
6 SAGE Open
the study in which this response was given classify it under
the heading of "appeal to higher loyalties," though "being
lazy" would seem to indicate little more than self-interest
rather than any "higher" value. The consumer might be
expressing a preference for being lazy, but he or she is not
thereby making a recognizably moral argument with which
he or she tries to justify his or her behavior. The consumer, I
would argue, is not ignorant of his or her wrongdoing, and
this obviates the need to ask whether his or her ignorance is
culpable, as it does for all moral backsliders.
A second category of consumer bracketed from the fol-
lowing analysis consists of those who may be deemed mor-
ally ignorant in Buchanan's terminology. Such people, to
recall, have faulty moral judgment such that we say of them
that they cannot make the moral judgments that most people
are able to make. A study by the Marketing Society (2010),
for instance, found that 20% of consumers "didn't care
[about] or weren't interested" in environmental sustainabil-
ity and did not consume according to environmental con-
cerns. This is a moral deficiency (especially regarding our
obligations to future generations and the environmental qual-
ity we bequeath to them). However, although there might be
substantial numbers of such morally ignorant consumers,
such cases take us away from the focus on factual ignorance.
A discussion of moral ignorance would require that we
examine what is meant when we say that a person cannot
make correct moral judgments; if a person literally cannot
make such judgments, the philosophical maxim "ought
implies can" would have us believe that the person who is
unable to judge ethical matters correctly is not culpable.
This, though, is a discussion for a different occasion. For the
purpose of this study, I am interested only in cases in which
a consumer occupies a different epistemological position to
that of backsliders or those who are morally ignorant. This
epistemological position is marked out by the following two
points. Consumers are
i. aware of the possibility of injustices surrounding
commodities they consume;
ii. not sufficiently aware of the disturbing details to pre-
vent them from purchasing them (cf. Smith, 1983, p.
546).
The backslider does not fulfill Condition (ii)--he is fully
aware of the details of the commodities he purchases and he
knows he ought not to purchase them. The person with defi-
cient moral judgment does not fulfill Condition (i), for she
does not recognize anything morally wrong about purchas-
ing unethically produced commodities.
Let us consider a representative consumer whose con-
sumption habits and ethical attitudes correspond to those of
many consumers. The representative consumer buys grocer-
ies from large supermarket chains, brand-name clothing
from multinational retailers, and non-sustainable furniture;
she ignores fair-trade products and drives a car with a high
rate of fuel consumption. Asked about her ethical views, the
consumer answers the following questions affirmatively:
a. Would you be concerned about cotton farmers in India
incurring high levels of debt and being driven to sui-
cide?
b. Would it worry you if textile workers in southeast Asia
were routinely exposed to unsafe working conditions?
c. Would it trouble you to know that major clothing re-
tailers sourced textiles from factories in which below-
school-aged children were employed?
d. Do you think that deforestation is a matter of concern?
e. Does the finite nature of fossil fuels mean that human
beings should economize on their use?
f. Are you disturbed that rising sea levels, which result
from climate change, poses a threat to the survival of
many of the world's species and of people in parts of
the world?
Because she answers these questions affirmatively, this
consumer manifests the gap between her consumption
behavior and her ethical beliefs. Her acts of consumption are
wrongful because they are implicated in harming others or
perpetuating injustice. But before we judge her blamewor-
thy, we must enquire to what extent she is ignorant of the
matters mentioned in points (a) to (f), and whether her igno-
rance is culpable.
When probed further, our representative consumer reveals
rudimentary awareness of ethical issues that pertain to cer-
tain business practices. She has not actively sought informa-
tion about such matters but has been informed about them
incidentally--through newspaper reports, television news
items, or conversations with acquaintances. Beyond this
rudimentary awareness, she takes no measures to inform her-
self further such that she would be in a position to compre-
hend her own causal role as a consumer in these processes,
and hence she does not change her consumption habits. Our
representative consumers' ignorance is akin to that of
Moody-Adams' CEO, for the consumer fulfills the aware-
ness condition described in the section "Preliminaries and
Caveats." That is, she is situated epistemologically in that
in-between space in which the question of culpable igno-
rance arises: She knows a little but not too much about the
commodities she purchases; she has enough evidence to give
rise to the suspicion that she might be contributing to injus-
tice, but she has "insufficient evidence to warrant holding
back from the contemplated act" (Smith, 1983, p. 546) of
purchasing a particular commodity. The representative con-
sumer's ignorance is culpable.
The source of the representative consumer's ignorance is,
following Smith (1983), an objectionable psychological
state that leads her to choose not to overcome or reduce her
ignorance. This objectionable psychological state consists in
willingness to risk the perpetuation of injustice through acts

this risk, then, is how one might best characterize this objec-
tionable psychological state. The agent's willingness to risk
the perpetuation of injustice presupposes that she is aware of
the risk but ignores it.
Degrees of Culpability
The representative consumer depicted above is culpably
ignorant because she is indifferent to a risk, of which she is
aware. This constitutes a culpably objectionable psychologi-
cal state. This example constitutes our baseline for culpable
ignorance, yet it is only the beginning of an analysis of cul-
pability, for the situation of actual consumers deviates from
that of our representative consumer in many ways. The ways
in which their situation differs from that of the representative
consumer can change their degree of culpability, as we shall
now see.
One way of exploring degrees of culpability attributable
to consumers is via the awareness condition, the fulfillment
of which requires that consumers be aware of a risk that a
morally undesirable state of affairs will arise or be perpetu-
ated if they maintain their ignorance. Following a line of
thought cast by Smith (1983, p. 551), we may say that igno-
rance is only culpable if the act of consumption, which
ensues from ignorance about the unethical nature of the com-
modity purchased, "falls within the known risk" (Smith,
1983, p. 551) of the consumer's state of ignorance. Two vari-
ables regarding this risk influence the degree of culpability
of the consumer's ignorance:
1. the magnitude of the risk;
2. the moral severity of the consequences, should the
undesirable state of affairs actually ensue as a result
of her act of consumption.
I postpone elucidation of Variable (2) until the next sec-
tion in the discussion of the second moral precept for ethical
consumption. Here I explore Variable (1).
The magnitude of the risk and the consumer's degree of
culpability are positively related. Consider a consumer who
buys cheap clothing made in Bangladesh and who has some
awareness of the risk that he is thereby perpetuating working
conditions in textile factories which he considers unjust. His
unethical act of consumption "falls within the known risk" of
his ignorance because the risk involved is self-evident: The
conditions of production under which cheap clothing is man-
ufactured in developing countries are widely known, and the
deplorable working conditions in textile factories are, as it
were, internally related to the production of the T-shirts (and
to their low prices), for low wages and poor working condi-
tions are a fillip, perhaps necessary, to the production of
cheap clothing. In Michael Zimmerman's (1997) words,
there is a straightforward "cognitive connection" between
the existence of cheap T-shirts in retail stores and the sort of
pay and conditions which the workers who produce them
suffer (p. 420). If a consumer were to plead that he had no
inkling that purchasing these items were likely to perpetuate
injustices, his words are unlikely to convince. This would
lead us to say that the consumer ought to have known about
the risk that buying cheap T-shirts, and the fact that he did
not know (or claimed not to have known) does not absolve
him. This is not, however, always the case, as a different
example shows.
The pharmaceutical corporation Roche, which produces a
drug called CellCept, presents such a case (Schrempf-
Stirling, 2014). CellCept hinders the rejection of transplanted
organs by their hosts. Roche's development of this drug
relied on the acquisition of organs taken from executed pris-
oners in China. Consider, in light of this, a person who
receives treatment using a different product manufactured by
Roche, for example, an intravenously administered antibac-
terial solution. We may say that consuming any Roche prod-
uct is wrongful because it contributes to the profitability of a
corporation that produces at least one commodity using
unethical means. The consumer who purchases the antibacte-
rial solution would, however, be absolved of the guilt associ-
ated with contributing to the profitability of Roche because
the connection between the bacterial solution and CellCept is
remote; we would not say that the consumer ought to know
about this connection. Culpability would therefore stop with
the corporation but not seep to the level of the consumer.
If we consider now consumers of CellCept itself, one fea-
ture of the case should make us wary of generalizing it to
other commodities. CellCept is a potentially lifesaving drug
for a patient undergoing organ transplantation. Consider a
patient who knows about Roche's use of executed prisoners'
organs in testing the drug. The ethical consumer must con-
sider the effects of refusing to take such a drug. If there are
few or only less effective alternatives to CellCept, the chance
of losing one's life as a result of organ rejection is a high
moral cost of refusing to take the drug. A patient would jus-
tifiably hold the moral value of increasing her chance of
post-transplant survival to be higher than the moral value of
extricating herself from complicity in the use of executed
prisoners'organs. This would be an example of moral weigh-
ing, whereby a person weighs the wrongness of committing
an immoral act (in this case consuming CellCept) against the
moral gain to be had (increasing life expectancy by taking
the drug).4 We might forgive a consumer of CellCept for
holding the gain to be of higher moral value to herself than
the immorality of being implicated in a commodity with an
unethical biography. This is not a case of moral backsliding
because the consumer does not, all things considered, believe
that her consumption of the drug is wrong on account of the
positive moral effects it is likely to have in prolonging her
post-transplant life. Neither is it a case of ignorance, for the
consumer has sufficient information about the product to
make a sound ethical judgment.
CellCept may be described as a "high-stake" commodity.
If the consumption of a particular commodity is likely to
8 SAGE Open
have profound moral effects on the life of the consumer (in
the case of CellCept, increasing the consumer's life expec-
tancy), that commodity is, for this consumer, of high stake.
Other commodities involve a lower stake in the sense that the
consequences of not purchasing them are of little or no moral
consequence.5 If, for instance, I refrain from buying what I
consider to be ethically dubious clothing made in Vietnam,
my moral sacrifice is not great: By thus refraining, I will
have to spend more money to pay for ethically sourced cloth-
ing, but for people of comfortable means, this is not a moral
sacrifice. One consideration, then, in judging a consumer's
culpability concerns the moral sacrifice one would have to
make if one were to refrain from consuming a particular
commodity. In the case of CellCept, the sacrifice is poten-
tially great; in the case of clothing it is usually not great.
In the previous example, I stated that, for people of com-
fortable means, the sacrifice involved in buying ethically
sourced clothing is not great. But for the less well-to-do, the
sacrifice can be high. Consider a not atypical U.S. resident
who supports two dependents, works 40 hr per week, and
earns US$8.50 per hour (above the minimum wage). If such
a person works 52 weeks of the year, after paying social
security, rent, health insurance, and the costs of a car, he or
she will be left with a disposable income below US$3,000
per annum to support his or her family, or under US$3 per
day per person (Stiglitz, 2012). Given his or her paltry
income, buying ethically sourced clothing or fair-trade food
might make this person unable to afford a winter coat for his
or her children, to provide them with adequate calorific
intake, or to treat them to 1 week's vacation every other year.
These items, which he or she would have to relinquish if he
or she were to consume ethically, might, in light of the obli-
gations he or she has toward his or her children, be of greater
moral import to him or her than the plight of textile workers
in Vietnam. Purchasing cheap, rather than ethically sourced,
clothing allows this person to reserve part of his income to
fulfill obligations which he or she deems to be of higher
moral import, and so his or her moral weighing would lead
him or her not to consume ethically. As a person's income
increases, however, he or she is likely to purchase ever more
items, the consumption of which does not fulfill any moral
obligation; as a greater proportion of one's income is spent
on luxuries, directing one's expenditure to ethically pro-
duced commodities is likely to impose ever smaller moral
costs on the consumer. Hence the higher the income of a per-
son, the more stringent we should be in applying standards of
ethical consumption. And the poorer one is, the more likely,
ceteris paribus, one will sacrifice something of moral import
when consuming ethically, and this acts as a mitigating factor
in one's culpability for perpetrating injustices in the produc-
tion of commodities that one consumes.
A poor person who consumes ethically tainted commodi-
ties does not necessarily do so in ignorance (culpable or oth-
erwise). The poor person just depicted is engaged in moral
weighing, as was our CellCept user. If a person deems ethical
consumption to involve a moral sacrifice greater than the
moral gain, one would have to inspect his or her moral
weighing to ascertain whether this be a reasonable judgment.
If the cost of consuming ethically leaves a person unable to
fulfill basic obligations to himself or herself or to those with
whom he or she stands in a special ethical relationship, we
are likely to absolve him or her of culpability for consuming
unethically. If, for instance, I would be unable to nourish my
children if I were to divert my paltry financial resources to
ethical consumption, I would probably be declared blameless
for doing so. Whatever our verdict, though, it should be
noted that culpability in such cases is not a function of igno-
rance, for the consumer need not be ignorant of the relevant
ethical implications. I might, that is, be forced by my meager
means to buy unethically produced commodities in full
knowledge of the harms I am perpetuating. But if the money
I save by consuming such products allows me to nourish my
family and stop its members from falling into chronic ill
health, I might be justified in acting thus. I am thereby not
necessarily ignorant of any causal impact of my deeds. If I
am censured for taking this course of action, I will be casti-
gated not because of my ignorance but because my moral
weighing is deemed faulty.
Precepts for Ethical Consumption
Having outlined some variables that affect the degree of con-
sumers' culpability, we now issue practical precepts for ethi-
cal consumption:
Precept 1: Inform yourself first about those commodities
the consumption of which, ceteris paribus, has the highest
probability of giving rise to a moral wrong.
One's ignorance about commodities is associated with a
risk that we will buy commodities the production of which
involves harm or injustice to innocent others. Consumers are
often aware that they risk perpetuating injustices through
their acts of consumption. But the magnitude of the risk
involved will vary. For instance, purchasing meat or dairy
products from a budget supermarket has a close cognitive
connection to the moral wrong of harming animals, and
hence the probability that the harm ensues is high. It is implau-
sible that a person is unaware of the connection between the
suffering of animals and the ways in which they are farmed,
especially for the production of low cost food. Like Moody-
Adams' CEO, one might not want to confront the details of
animal farming, but one would have to be quite active in culti-
vating this ignorance, not least in the sense of putting thoughts
about the lives of animals one eats to the back of one's mind. A
consumer of a Roche product, by contrast, is unlikely to be
aware of a connection between purchasing, say, an antibacterial
medication and the profitability of a corporation that uses ethi-
cally dubious methods to develop a different, ethically suspect,
treatment, namely CellCept. The closeness of the cognitive
Peacock 9
connection between purchasing cheap meat and harm to ani-
mals should lead her to prioritize the task of informing herself
about the risk of consuming meat. The distant cognitive con-
nection between Roche's wrongdoing and the consumption of
one of the corporation's non-transplant-related products
makes it a less obvious target for immediate investigation.
A second precept of ethical consumption concerns the
severity of the moral consequences that might ensue from
acts of consumption. Consider a consumer who is aware of a
risk that buying commodities A and B will perpetuate injus-
tices, denoted I
A
and I
B
, respectively. The consumer also esti-
mates (however roughly) the probability that I
A
and I
B
will be
perpetuated by his acts of consumption to be p(I
A
) and p(I
B
),
respectively. If p(I
A
)  p(I
B
), the consumer is more culpable
for his ignorance that leads to the purchase of A if he deems
I
A
to be greater than I
B
. This, then, issues in the following
precept, which returns us to variable (2) of the previous
section:
Precept 2: Reduce your ignorance about those commodi-
ties the consumption of which, ceteris paribus, risks
engendering or sustaining the most severe moral
consequences.
Other things being equal, one's degree of culpability for
remaining ignorant about commodity C and the pernicious
effects associated with it is greater the more severe the moral
consequences of purchasing C are. Note, though, that
Precepts 1 and 2 can pull a consumer's investigations in
opposite directions. Purchasing commodity A in ignorance
about its severe moral implications is worse than purchasing
commodity B that is associated with minor moral infractions.
This should lead a consumer who abides by Precept 2 to
investigate the ethical biography of commodity A rather than
B. But if the consumer estimates the risk of perpetuating
injustice by consuming A to be very small (and perhaps the
consumer, as in the Roche case, is unaware of the risk), she
is counseled by Precept 1 to investigate commodity B if con-
suming B carries a high probability of perpetuating the minor
ethical misdemeanors associated with B's production. The
consumer who acts on Precepts 1 and 2 is, then, involved in
a calculation in which the estimation of moral wrong and the
estimation of its likelihood are to be balanced.
Precepts 1 and 2 must be augmented by a third that
addresses the ease with which information about commodities
can be gathered. Consider the following moral excuse that
might be offered on behalf of consumers whose ignorance
leads them to purchase unethically produced commodities:
Those who advocate ethical consumption underestimate the
difficulty of finding out the morally relevant facts needed to
assess whether a commodity has been ethically produced. Of the
thousands of products we buy, we would be cognitively
overstretched if we were to apprise ourselves of the details of
even a handful of value chains which some of those commodities
had traversed before arriving in retail stores. The impossibility
of informing ourselves sufficiently about every available
product means that our ignorance is not culpable and hence we
must be absolved of culpability for our acts of unethical
consumption.
This moral excuse casts doubt on the feasibility of sub-
jecting all or even many of our consumption decisions to
ethical scrutiny. Even the most ethical consumer will unwit-
tingly purchase some ethically dubious commodities. The
insurmountability of consumers' ignorance regarding com-
modities, the moral excuse would have us believe, absolves
them of blame for purchasing them. This excuse might apply
to many ethically concerned consumers who, despite a gen-
eral awareness of corporate malfeasance in many sectors,
often lack specific information about individual corporations
(Carrigan &Attalla, 2001), for to delve into the ethical record
of myriad corporations is no small task.
Of what, though, does the above moral excuse absolve
consumers? It does not absolve them of culpability for their
ignorance tout court, for although it might be impossible that
a consumer inform herself about every commodity, this does
not warrant the inference that she is permitted to inform her-
self about none, or even about a good number of them. To
argue otherwise would be a false generalization of the moral
excuse. The impossibility of informing herself fully about
every commodity does not mean that it is impossible (or
even terribly difficult) for her to inform herself to some
degree about some commodities. The question then becomes
"About which, among the sea of commodities available,
should a consumer inform herself so as to avoid the state of
being culpably ignorant?" Precepts 1 and 2 give guidance on
this, but we should add a further precept that pertains to the
relative ease with which reliable information can be found
which can strengthen or weaken the consumer's suspicion
about the unethical nature of a commodity. Thus we have the
following:
Precept 3: Obtain information first about those commod-
ities about which, ceteris paribus, reliable information is
relatively easily gathered.
Precept 3 takes the onus of arduous information-gathering
exercises from the consumer's shoulders, but it does not tell
us at which point the consumer may relieve herself of further
information collection while being non-culpable for her
remaining ignorance. For we have absolved the consumer of
culpability for being ignorant about all available commodi-
ties. But at which point may she stop collecting further infor-
mation about some of the commodities she purchases while
being non-culpable for acts of consumption that implicate
her in wrongdoing? The answer to this question depends on
moral weighing. One suggestion for a rule of moral weighing
takes its inspiration from Peter Singer who, in a discussion of
duties of assistance, writes,
10 SAGE Open
If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening,
without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral
importance, we ought, morally, to do it. By "without sacrificing
anything of comparable moral importance" I mean without
causing anything else comparably bad to happen. (Singer, 1972,
p. 231)
I call this the Singer criterion for moral action. One can
apply it to the information-gathering duties of consumers
who are ignorant about commodities they might purchase.
The Singer criterion applied to this task would issue in a fur-
ther precept:
Precept 4: Gather information about commodities you
might consider purchasing up to the point at which the
cost of further information gathering involves a moral
sacrifice that outweighs the moral harm avoided by col-
lecting more information.
Gathering information about commodities one might con-
sume has two effects: It (a) reduces the risk that injustices
associated with the production of those commodities will be
perpetuated, and (b) imposes a cost on the consumer who
gathers the information. The former effect is clearly moral--
it puts the consumer into a position from which she can
reduce injustice. The costs of gathering information (effect
[b]) might be included in the moral deliberation of the con-
sumer, but only if these costs are morally relevant. Whether
these costs are moral depends on the particularities of the
consumer's situation, as the following examples indicate.
The costs of information gathering may be deemed mor-
ally relevant if the time the consumer spares himself by not
gathering information about commodities is instead used in
the pursuit of something of greater moral worth. Hence, if a
consumer decides not to spend a further unit of time collect-
ing information about the ethical characteristics of commodi-
ties, he relinquishes a moral gain, which consists in a reduction
of the risk that the consumer will unwittingly purchase ethi-
cally tainted commodities; relinquishing this moral gain can
only be compensated if the consumer uses that unit of time to
pursue an end that is morally at least as valuable as the reduc-
tion in the risk that he purchases an ethically tainted commod-
ity. So if I decide not to spend a further hour informing myself
about the clothing I buy because that hour is better spent in
pursuit of animal liberation, my culpability for remaining
ignorant about the clothes I buy will be diminished (or extin-
guished) if the hour of activism for animal liberation move-
ments is deemed to be morally more important than divesting
myself of ignorance about clothing. Or, to return to the resident
of the United States mentioned in the previous section, if
researching the ethical characteristics of commodities reduces
the time available to him for working overtime in his job, the
moral cost, for example, being unable adequately to feed his
family because of low income, might be held to be so high that
it excuses him from the information-gathering exercise through
which he would reduce his ignorance about commodities. If,
however, one's reason for not informing oneself further
about the world of commodities is simply laziness or conve-
nience, or the fact that "other people do not inform them-
selves about commodities, so why should I?" one cannot
compensate for the moral loss of not informing oneself fur-
ther (and hence increasing the risk that one purchases an
ethically tainted commodity) because these excuses are not
moral excuses. This does not mean that the consumer must
set herself the impossible task of informing herself about
each and every commodity she might purchase, but it does
commit her to informing herself up to the point at which she
believes she would relinquish something of greater moral
importance were she to continue to gather information about
the commodities she consumes.
Conclusion
This article has explored consumers' ignorance about com-
modities they purchase and has asked under which condi-
tions their ignorance makes them morally culpable. My focus
has been on consumers who are factually, rather than mor-
ally, ignorant. That is, I have been concerned with consumers
who are ignorant about the modes of production of the com-
modities they consume, but not with those consumers whose
sense of right and wrong is defective. Through a re-working
of Michele Moody-Adams' concept of affected ignorance, I
established the defining criterion for determining whether
ignorance is culpable to reside in the awareness condition. To
fulfill this condition, a consumer must be aware of a risk that
her consumption of a given commodity will engender or help
to sustain harms or injustices to others. This sets the lower
bound to a consumer's awareness if she is to fulfill the aware-
ness condition. The awareness condition also sets an upper
bound to the degree of awareness the consumer has about the
commodities she consumes. The upper bound to the aware-
ness condition means that the consumer is not permitted to
have a degree of awareness extensive enough to prevent her
from purchasing unethically produced commodities; neither
can she be so well informed about the commodity in question
that she purchases it in the knowledge that doing so is wrong-
ful, for this would be a case of moral backsliding. The aware-
ness condition thus constrains the consumer from two sides:
She must have some awareness of the unethical nature of
commodities, but not too much. Her awareness of the ethi-
cally dubious nature of commodities allows us to describe
her as making a choice not to overcome her ignorance if she
does not take steps to inform herself further about these com-
modities. From within the epistemological space carved out
by the awareness condition, I have investigated consumers'
culpability for acts of consumption that inflict harm on oth-
ers or perpetuate injustices.
To investigate consumers' culpability, I depicted a repre-
sentative consumer who fulfills the awareness condition and
Peacock 11
whose ignorance is therefore culpable. Following that, a
number of mitigating circumstances were enumerated, all of
which lessened or annulled the consumer's culpability. These
include cases in which the harm arising from an act of uneth-
ical consumption falls outside the risk of the consumer's
ignorance. That is, for cases in which the risk is remote and
in which, therefore, there is no obvious cognitive connec-
tion between the act of consumption and the harm that
ensues, the consumer's culpability is diminished. We do
not expect consumers to be aware of distant or arcane con-
nections between their consumption and the harms it
causes. The remoteness or proximity of the risk that one
will engender harm through one's acts of consumption is a
factor underlying the first precept of ethical consumption.
The second factor that determines the degree of culpability
concerns the severity of the moral consequences of con-
suming unethically as a result of one's ignorance.
Consideration of this factor lay at the basis of the second
precept of ethical consumption, which counseled consum-
ers to reduce their ignorance about those commodities the
consumption of which lead to the most severe moral con-
sequences. A third reason for absolving a consumer of cul-
pability lies in the moral sacrifice involved in informing
oneself about commodities. If overcoming one's ignorance
so that one can avoid purchasing ethically tainted com-
modities involves a moral sacrifice greater than the harm
one is likely to arise by remaining ignorant, remaining
ignorant is justified. Those of lower income are likely to
have to sacrifice something of greater moral relevance
when they seek information about commodities than those
endowed with more income and wealth. The moral sacri-
fice of overcoming one's ignorance about commodities is a
factor underlying the third and fourth precepts for ethical
consumption.
Although there are many circumstances that lessen the
degree to which our ignorance may be deemed culpable, my
argument suggests that we are less innocent than many will
wish to admit when we make consumption decisions that
cause harm or injustices to others. Significantly, to narrow the
gap between our ethical attitudes and our behavior would
require significant changes in behavior the attainment of
which, to many, will seem unrealistic. Yet the difficulty in
making our conduct ethical should not deter us from remind-
ing ourselves of what we ought to do in the sphere of
consumption.
Finally, the conceptual analysis contained in this article
points to avenues of empirical research. Such research would
be of an ethnographic nature or based on surveys. It would
attempt to ascertain the prevalence of different types of atti-
tudes among consumers. This would allow one to determine
how many consumers are morally ignorant in the consump-
tion decisions they make, how many are factually ignorant,
and, among these, how many manifest a degree of ignorance
that satisfies the awareness condition. Those whose igno-
rance does fall within these confines would be deemed cul-
pable for their ignorance.
