Introduction
Primary aldosteronism is characterized by hypertension,
hypokalemia, suppressed plasma renin activity (PRA) and
autonomous aldosterone production.1­3 The excess aldos-
terone could be associated with a pressure-independent
remodeling of the left ventricle. Compared to patients with
similar levels of hypertension, patients with primary aldo-
steronism have greater left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)
and increased rate of cardiovascular complications.4,5 The
presence of LVH should be detected as early as possible to
prevent cardiovascular complications associated with the
condition. The 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) is rec-
ommended as the routine test for detection of LVH in
patients with arterial hypertension because of its estab-
lished clinical value, broad availability, and low cost.
Sokolow-Lyon index,6 Cornell voltage index,7 Cornell
product index,8 and Gubner index9 have been most com-
monly used to rule out LVH in patients with arterial hyper-
tension. In this study, we evaluated their comparative
diagnostic value for LVH in patients with primary
aldosteronism.
Methods
Study population
From January 2005 to December 2011, a total of 93 patients
with primary aldosteronism were referred to our hospital.
Primary aldosteronism was confirmed with captopril chal-
lenge test, furosemide plus upright test and/or salt loading

Abstract
Background: Compared to patients with similar levels of hypertension, patients with primary aldosteronism have a
greater left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The presence of LVH should be detected as early as possible to prevent
cardiovascular complications associated with the condition. We evaluated comparative diagnostic value of electrocardio-
graphic (ECG) indexes for LVH in patients with primary aldosteronism.
Methods: ECG and echocardiographic data were obtained in 88 patients with primary aldosteronism. We analyzed the
four most commonly used ECG indexes, including Sokolow-Lyon index, Cornell voltage index, Cornell product index,
and Gubner index.
Results: Echocardiographic LVH was found in 35 patients (40%). Sensitivity ranged from 0% for Gubner index to 49% for
Cornell product index. Specificity ranged from 81% for Sokolow-Lyon index to 100% for Gubner index. Sokolow-Lyon index
(r=0.43, p<0.001), Cornell voltage index (r=0.55, p<0.001) and Cornell product index (r=0.52, p<0.001) correlated signifi-
cantly with left ventricular mass (LVM) index. No significant correlation was found between Gubner index and LVM index.
Conclusions: ECG indexes had a reasonably high specificity, but a low sensitivity for LVH in patients with primary
aldosteronism. Cornell voltage index and Cornell product index had a better diagnostic value of LVH, and had a better
correlation with LVM index in these patients.

test. One patient with ventricular pacing and four patients
with bundle branch block were excluded from analysis
because electrocardiographic LVH could not be assessed in
these patients. Thus, this study consisted of 88 patients with
primary aldosteronism. Informed consent was obtained
from each patient.
Laboratory examinations
PRA and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) were
measured by radioimmunoassay. Blood was collected from
an antecubital vein, and serum potassium concentrations
were measured using a standard ion electrode method.
Hypokalemia was defined as serum potassium less than 3.6
mEq/l.10
Electrocardiogram
A 12-lead ECG was recorded on admission at a paper speed
of 25 mm/sec and an amplification of 10 mm/mV. We ana-
lyzed in detail the four most commonly used ECG indexes,
including Sokolow-Lyon index, Cornell voltage index,
Cornell product index, and Gubner index. These indexes
were measured in each ECG as follows:
Sokolow-Lyon index - SV1
+ RV5
Cornell voltage index - RaVL
+ SV3
Cornell product index - men: (RaVL
+ SV3
)×QRS duration;
women (RaVL
+ SV3
+ 8 )×QRS duration
Gubner index - RI + SIII
Electrocardiographic LVH was defined as Sokolow-Lyon
index > 3.5 mV, Cornell voltage index > 2.8 mV in men and
> 2.0 mV in women, Cornell product index > 2440 mm·ms
in men and > 2440 mm·ms in women, and Gubner index >
2.5 mV.
Echocardiography
Transthoracic echocardiographic data were obtained on
admission using a commercial ultrasound machine. Two-
dimensional guided M-mode measurements of left ventricu-
lar end-diastolic diameter (LVDD), interventricular septum
thickness (IVS), and posterior wall thickness (PW) were
measured. Left ventricular mass (LVM) was calculated using
the formula of Deverreux and Reichek11,12: left ventricular
mass (g) =1.04[(LVDD+IVS+PW)3-(LVDD)3]-13.6. LVM
index was calculated by dividing LVM by body surface area.
Echocardiographic LVH was defined as LVM index > 131 g/
m2 in men and > 100 g/m2 in women.13
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with chi-square
and Student's t-tests. Relations between variables were
determined by linear regression analysis. All data are
expressed as mean±SD. Differences were considered sig-
nificant if the p value was <0.05.

Accuracy of ECG indexes for diagnosis of
echocardiographic LVH
Table 2 shows the accuracy of the four ECG indexes for
diagnosis of echocardiographic LVH. Sensitivity ranged
from 0% for Gubner index to 49% for Cornell product
index. Specificity ranged from 81% for Sokolow-Lyon
index to 100% for Gubner index. Correct diagnosis was
obtained in 66% with Sokolow-Lyon index, in 69% with
Cornell voltage index, in 70% with Cornell product index,
and in 60% with Gubner index.

Cornell product index (r=0.52, p<0.001) correlated signifi-
cantly with LVM index. On the other hand, no significant
correlation was found between Gubner index and LVM
index.
Effect of hypokalemia on QRS voltage of
ECG indexes
There were 28 patients with hypokalemia and 60 patients
with normokalemia (Table 3). Serum potassium levels were
2.98 ± 0.47 mEq/l and 4.00 ± 0.31 mEq/l, respectively.
Sokolow-Lyon index and Cornell voltage index as well as
LVM index were significantly higher in hypokalemic
patients than normokalemic patients. However, these ECG
indexes divided by LVM index were similar between the
two groups. There was no significant difference in Gubner
index between the two groups.
Discussion
The current study demonstrated the following: 1) com-
monly used ECG indexes had a reasonably high specificity,
but the power to rule in LVH was unsatisfactory because of
low sensitivity in patients with primary aldosteronism; and
2) Cornell voltage index and Cornell product index had a
better diagnostic value for LVH, and had a better correla-
tion with LVM index.
Arterial hypertension is a major cause of coronary artery
disease, stroke, LVH, and heart failure. Several studies
have shown that LVH is an important risk factor in patients
with hypertension, leading to a 5- to 10-fold increase in
cardiovascular risk.14­16 ECG is a routine test to rule out
LVH in patients with hypertension. Although more than 30
indexes for detection of LVH have been described, only
several ECG indexes such as Sokolow-Lyon index, Cornell
voltage index, Cornell product index, and Gubner index
remain to be used in the clinical setting.
Previous clinical studies showed that patients with pri-
mary aldosteronism had greater LVH and worse diastolic
function compared to patients with similar levels of hyper-
tension.4 The renin­angiotensin­aldosterone system is
thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of LVH
independent of increased blood pressure.17 Experimental
studies have shown that aldosterone induces cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy, profound changes in the extracellular matrix,
leading to collagen deposition and subsequently to myocar-
dial fibrosis.18­20 Although primary aldosteronism is often
accompanied by LVH, there has been no report evaluating
comparative diagnostic value of ECG indexes for LVH in
these patients. In the current study, we demonstrated that
commonly used ECG indexes had a reasonably high speci-
ficity, but a low sensitivity for LVH in patients with primary
aldosteronism. Our results in primary aldosteronism were
similar to those previously shown in arterial hypertension.21
Among the four indexes, Cornell voltage index and Cornell
product index had a better diagnostic value for LVH, and had
a better correlation with LVM index in patients with primary
aldosteronism. Both adrenalectomy and aldosterone antago-
nists are known to be effective in reducing LVM index in
patients with primary aldosteronism.22,23 Our results sug-
gested that Cornell voltage or Cornell product index might
be suitable for evaluating the degree of LVH or monitoring
reduced LVH after these interventions.
The ECG was insensitive for detection of LVH in the
current study. However, previous studies have shown that
electrocardiographic LVH and echocardiographic LVH
predict mortality independently of each other,24 and that
combined these findings improve risk stratification.25 These
imply that electrocardiographic LVH and echocardio-
graphic LVH in part carry different prognostic information.

Therefore, both ECG and echocardiography should be per-
formed to assess the considerable risk associated with these
conditions in patients with primary aldosteronism.
Previous studies reported that a significant reduction of
QRS voltage was observed after short-term potassium sup-
plementation, suggesting hypokalemia might be at least
partly relevant to the high QRS voltage in patients with pri-
mary aldosteronism.26 In the current study, Sokolow-Lyon
index and Cornell voltage index as well as LVM index were
significantly higher in hypokalemic patients than normoka-
lemic patients. However, these ECG indexes divided by
LVM index were similar between the two groups, suggest-
ing that QRS voltage reflected LVM index well in spite of
serum potassium level. It appeared that hypokalemia did
not affect QRS voltage as much as LVM index. In the cur-
rent study, PAC was significantly higher in hypokalemic
patients than normokalemic patients. Therefore, we specu-
lated that hypokalemia reflected more severe hyperaldo-
steronism that could cause greater LVH.
There are several limitations in the current study. First,
we did not assess other ECG indexes. Romhilt-Estes score
has been also used to rule out LVH in patients with arterial
hypertension. However, this scoring system is not easy in
the clinical setting, and includes ST-T segment pattern with
high points that is often associated with hypokalemia.27,28
Because there was a possibility that Romhilt-Estes score
might overestimate LVH especially in hypokalemic patients,
we did not include Romhilt-Estes score in the current study.
Second, we obtained ECG and echocardiographic data rou-
tinely only before potassium supplement in hypokalemic
patients. Therefore, we could not assess the change in these
data before and after potassium supplement. There was a
possibility that, in hypokalemic patients, ECG indexes after
potassium supplementation might have a better diagnostic
value for LVH, and had a better correlation with LVM index
in patients with primary aldosteronism.
In conclusion, ECG indexes had a reasonably high spec-
ificity, but a low sensitivity for LVH in patients with pri-
mary aldosteronism. Cornell voltage index and Cornell
product index had a better diagnostic value of LVH, and
had a better correlation with LVM index in these patients.
