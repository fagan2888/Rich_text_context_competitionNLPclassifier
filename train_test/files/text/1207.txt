Abstract
Background: early studies reported controversial findings on association of apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism with
disability.
Objective: to analyse sex-specific associations of APOE genotypes with impairments in (instrumental) activities of daily
living [(I)ADL] and mortality.
Design: population-based 1999 National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) of the US older (65+) individuals.
Participants: genetic data are available for 1,805 individuals.
Methods: each of six genotypes of three common alleles of the APOE locus (2, 3 and 4) was tested on the association
with a disability index or mortality.
Results: APOE 3/3 genotype significantly decreases odds ratio (OR) for IADL disability in males [OR = 0.48; 95%
Confidence Interval (CI) 0.31­0.76] while it exhibits no association in females. The OR for ADL disability is 0.19 (CI
0.04­0.99) for 4/4 female carriers. The 2/3 genotype increases the chances of IADL disability for males (OR = 2.33; CI
1.28­4.25). No significant association between APOE polymorphism and mortality was found. A surprising observation was
that 4/4 female carriers have a 5.3 times lower chance of having ADL disability than non-4/4-carriers.
Conclusions: association of the APOE polymorphism with disability and lack of association with mortality support the view
that APOE gene actions may be more significant as modulators of frailty than of longevity.
Keywords: apolipoprotein E, disability, sex differences, elderly
Introduction
Three major polymorphic alleles of the apolipoprotein E
(APOE) locus (2, 3 and 4) can be presumed to play
an important role in the transport of cholesterol and other
lipids, although their complete biological activities [1] may
involve additional mechanisms. Numerous studies have
demonstrated an association of the APOE polymorphism
and the risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease
(AD) as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD), including
atherosclerosis and stroke [2, 3]. The APOE polymorphism
has also been reported to be associated with mortality
risk [4, 5]; these findings are controversial, however, as a
number of recent studies did not reveal a relationship
between APOE alleles and mortality [6, 7].
It was hypothesised that the APOE polymorphism
might be associated with other adverse health outcomes
affecting the functional status of individuals [8, 9]. This
hypothesis is justified by the association of a low level
of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with disability in
older individuals [10, 11], but knowledge of the association
of the APOE polymorphism with disability remains limited.
For example, it was shown that the APOE 4 allele was
associatedwithpoorfunctionalstatusincommunity-dwelling
older Americans who retained normal cognitive function [8].
Later studies of Italian octo- and nonagenarians, however,
did not show such an association [12]. Moreover, while
the APOE 4 allele was not associated with a population-
wide decline in functional status in the Duke Established
288
APOE gene, disability, and mortality
Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly
(EPESE) participants [13], female carriers of the APOE
4 allele, particularly those who had comparatively good
baseline functional scores, did exhibit significant functional
declines [13]. Further analyses of the EPESE data show no
associations between the APOE 4 status and any of the
five dimensions of quality of life [14]. More recently, it was
shown that the APOE 4 polymorphism is associated with
an excess of mobility limitation but not with self-reported
functional limitations [9].
An interpretation of the prevalence of APOE polymor-
phism in samples of old versus younger individuals has
suggested that APOE is a `longevity' gene [15]. However,
while the APOE 4 allele has been shown to signifi-
cantly increase risks of certain disorders (e.g. CVD, AD),
its effect on total mortality was not found to be substantial
in recent studies [16, 17]. This suggests a possible protective
effect of the APOE 4 allele on risks of other disorders.
APOE has also been viewed as a `frailty' gene rather than a
`longevity' gene [16, 17]. Disability is often viewed as a man-
ifestation of stress vulnerability in older people [18]; such
vulnerability is referred to as `frailty' by demographers [19].
Although physiological frailty and disability are generally
distinct concepts [18], they partly overlap since disability is
associated with physiological frailty [18, 20]. If that is the
case, a stronger association of the APOE genotypes with
disability than mortality would suggest a greater impact upon
frailty than upon longevity.
In this work we analyse sex-specific associations among
subjects stratified by disability status and specific APOE
genotypes in a sample of the 1999 National Long Term
Care Survey (NLTCS) for whom biological specimens were
collected. The phenotype of mortality was also investigated.
Weaddresstwomainquestions:(i) isdisabilitystatussensitive
to the APOE polymorphism? (ii) do gene actions of various
genotypic variants function more as modulators of frailty
rather than of longevity?
Methods
Study population
The NLTCS is a nationally representative survey which
provides a large set of self- and proxy-reported data (several
thousands variables, depending on the NLTCS wave) on
health and functioning of the US elderly with a particular
focus on disabled individuals. Each of five NLTCS waves
is linked to Medicare service use and vital statistics files
(currently from 1982 to August, 2003). The NLTCS is
considered to be one of the best designed surveys to assess
chronic disability (activity limitations due to disability or
health problems which require either active help or standby
help, or equipment use and last 90+ days [21]) in the US
elderly (65+) individuals [22]. To complete the NLTCS,
a two-stage interviewing process was used. A screening
interview assessing chronic disability was given to all
participants randomly selected from the Medicare enrollees.
A detailed interview was given to (i) those who reported
at least one chronic impairment in (instrumental) activities
of daily living (I)ADL, (ii) institutionalised individuals, and
(iii) those who received a detailed interview in a previous
survey. The 1994 and 1999 surveys also explicitly included
samples of individuals who were designated for detailed
interviews before being give a test on disability. Therefore,
by the survey design, disabled persons are over-sampled in
detailed questionnaires (for details see [21] and references
therein) that provide unique opportunity to focus on such
vulnerable portion of the older population.
The 1999 NLTCS with APOE information
Biospecimens were collected during 2000­2002 for a sub-
sample of the 1999 NLTCS participants. A total of 2,075
blood and buccal cell samples were collected to assess the
effects of selected genetic markers on human longevity and
physical function. The APOE 2, 3 and 4 alleles were
determined by the presence or absence of certain restriction
sites [23]. Assays were done for 1,805 individuals. To test for
the reproducibility of the genotyping, 47 peripheral blood
samples (1 2/2; 8 2/3; 3 2/4; 20 3/3; 11 3/4; 4
4/4) were re-genotyped using two different methods: the
original restriction digestion method [23] and an automated
sequencing method [24]. The results with all three assays
were concordant for each of the genotypes.
For seven individuals, information on disability was
missing, and thus they were excluded from the analysis.
Among the other 1,798 individuals there were 680 males
(37.8%). Mean age of males was 76.4 years [standard error
(SE): 0.3] and of females was 78.4 (SE: 0.2) on the date
of interview. The frequencies of the APOE polymorphism
were: 2/2, n = 13, 0.7%; 2/3, n = 243, 13.5%; 2/4,
n = 42, 2.3%; 3/3, n = 1,127, 62.7%; 3/4, n = 351,
19.5%; and 4/4, n = 22, 1.2%.
Disability measures
Information on disability is assessed from the NLTCS
community and institutional questionnaires. Community
questionnaire covers 96.4% of the genetic sub-sample
and assesses six impairments in ADL [25] (eating, getting
in/out of bed, getting around inside, getting to the
bathroom/using the toilet, dressing and bathing) and ten
impairments associated with IADL [26] (doing heavy work,
doing light work, doing laundry, cooking, shopping for
groceries, getting around outside, going places outside of
walking distance, managing money, making telephone calls
and taking medicines). Remainder of the sample (n = 65)
represents institutional population which was interviewed
only on ADL impairments [21]. Since our analysis shows
that inclusion/exclusion of institutionalised individuals does
not significantly affect the estimates, we did not distinguish
between institutional and community samples. We have
found that the efficient way for analysis is to dichotomise
the disability measures selecting three indicators of: (i) any
disability (AnyDisb, n = 1,004, 299 males; either ADL or
IADL); (ii) IADL-only disability (IADL-only, n = 252, 97
289
A. Kulminski et al.
males; at least one IADL and no ADL), and (iii) ADL
disability (ADL-any, n = 752, 202 males; at least one ADL
irrespective of IADL). Since the IADLs reflect generally
less serious disabilities, while ADLs reflect more serious
disabilities [27], by selecting the latter two groups we cover
disabilities with distinct severity levels [22]. A reference
group was composed of non-disabled individuals (Non-dis,
n = 794, 381 males).
Analysis
Statistical analyses of the data were performed using SPSS
software (release 12.0, Chicago, Illinois, USA). To test the
association of distinct disability groups with the APOE
genotypes, we used empirical analyses (t-statistics, chi-
square) and logistic regression analyses. Since the results
of both these approaches were qualitatively similar, only
the results of logistic models were retained. The relationship
between the APOE genotypes and mortality was tested using
the Cox proportional hazard regression models. Relative
risks (RR) of death were calculated over the follow-up time
(to August, 2003). Analyses were performed for males and
females combined and then for each sex (all models were
adjusted for age). In each analysis we used dichotomised
indices indicating carriers of given genotype(s) as contrasted
to carriers of all other genotypes (e.g. the 2/3 genotype
versus non-2/3 genotypes) and to carriers of the 3/3
genotype. Genetic studies involving multiple genes/alleles
often require correction for multiple testing [28]. They are
necessary to examine for `at least one genetic effect' among
the variety of genetic factors subject to testing. Since this
is obviously not the case in our study, the correction for
multiple testing is not required [29].
Results
Figure 1 depicts the results of pair-wise logistic regression
analyses [odds ratio; (OR)] of the associations between
disability and the APOE genotypes for the entire sample. The
ORs are significant for the 4/4 genotype for more serious
(ADL-any) impairments [OR = 0.15, 95% Confidence
Interval (CI): 0.03­0.71] and for the 3/3 genotype for
less serious (IADL-only) impairments (OR = 0.70, CI
0.53­0.95).
Figure 2 shows the results of the analyses for females
(a,b) and males (c,d). There are no 4/4 male carriers
with disabilities. Therefore, only females are in this group
in Figure 1. Logistic regression analyses show that the
4/4 genotype significantly decreases chances of ADL
impairments for females (OR = 0.19, CI 0.40­0.99).
For more frequent genotypes (Figure 2b and d) significant
ORs are seen for males but not for females. Significance
of the OR estimates for IADL-only group for the 3/3
genotype in Figure 1 is attributable to the presence of males.
Separating males and females results in chances of having
IADL becoming lesser and highly significant for males (OR
= 0.48, CI 0.31­0.76). IADL impairments make the OR
for males with any disability to be significant (OR = 0.71,

CI 0.51­0.97). Similar behaviour (but of opposite nature)
is seen for the 2/3 genotype. Specifically, the 2/3 male
carriers have significantly higher chances of IADL disability
than the non-2/3 carriers (OR = 2.33, CI 1.28­4.25).
Significance of the OR estimates for males with any disability
are attributable to IADL impairments (OR = 1.62, CI
1.02­2.58). The results for the APOE genotypes contrasted
by the 3/3 genotype are similar (not shown here).
Finally, we tested the relationship of the APOE genotypes
with mortality. The test was performed for the same
conditions as in the logistic regression analysis (i.e. for
males and females combined and then for males and females
separately, controlling for age). We found no significant
associations of mortality for carriers of any particular APOE
genotype with respect to carriers of other genotypes. We
also found no such associations, using as a reference group
carriers of the 3/3 genotype (Table 1). Note that the results
are insensitive to the type of the reference group.

a unique opportunity to study the association of the APOE
polymorphism with various outcomes focusing on the
effect-modification by disability. In this study we examined
an association of the APOE genotypes with disability of
different severity and mortality to clarify two issues. First, we
checked whether there is an association between a particular
APOE genotype and disability. Second, we contributed to
the discussion on whether APOE can be considered as a
`longevity' or `frailty' gene [16, 17].
Unlike studies by Albert et al. [8] and in support of studies
by Melzer et al. [9] and Blazer et al. [13], our analysis does not
show significantly increased risks of disability in carriers of
the three APOE genotypes bearing an 4 allele. Contrary to
Albert et al. [8], our analysis reveals protection of the APOE
4/4 genotype against disability. Specifically, non-4/4
female carriers have 5.3 times greater chance of having more
severe (ADL) impairments than the APOE 4/4 female
carriers. We also reveal a protective function of 3/3 and an
adverse function of 2/3 in males with less severe (IADL)
disability.
Our analysis shows that the associations between the
APOE polymorphism and disability involve at least three
factors: the effects of genotype, severity of disability and
sex. Aggregation/disaggregation of the data along these
dimensions provides qualitatively different results that can
partly explain the disagreement of published studies. First,
we show that disaggregation of disability is important.
Specifically, while certain genotypes can affect mild disability,
they might be irrelevant to severe impairments (e.g. 3/3
291
A. Kulminski et al.
genotype, see Figure 1). Second, particular genotypes having
the same allele can contribute to the combined effect in
different ways. For example, 2/3 carriers have larger
chances of less severe disabilities (IADL), 3/4 carriers
are neutral to the presence of IADLs, and 3/3 carriers
have a significantly lower chances of IADL impairments
(Figure 1). The neutral and opposite tendencies exhibited by
these genotypes result in no association between less severe
disability and the 3-allele. Finally, sex also appears to be
important, revealing additional significant associations, i.e.
adverse function of the 2/3 genotype in males and neutral
impact in females on less severe disability. Obviously, other
factors (e.g. age and the APOE-associated diseases) might
contribute to the revealed associations; those issues deserve
separate study [30, 31].
Another intriguing finding is that none of the six APOE
genotypes is predictive of mortality in a Cox regression
analyses. Given the significance of the association of a
particular APOE genotype with disability and the association
of disability with frailty [20], as well as the lack of significance
for association of the same genotype with mortality, support
is provided for the view that APOE gene actions may be
more significant as modulators of frailty than of longevity
per se [16].
Key points
· Early studies generally reported no association of APOE
polymorphism with disability.
· The present NLTCS study demonstrates associations
between disability and APOE genotypes.
· Female 4/4 carriers and male 3/3 carriers have
diminished chances of developing more serious (ADL)
disabilities than the respective non-carriers.
· The 2/3 genotype increases the chance of less serious
(IADL) impairments for males.
