To investigate the role of religiosity in the earliest stages of drug involvement, the authors studied recent-onset
occurrence of first chances to try a drug and first actual drug use, expressed as a function of religious practice
behaviors, levels of religious devotion, and religious affiliation. Based upon standardized questionnaire
assessments of nationally representative samples of school-attending youths drawn in Panama, the five Spanish
heritage countries of Central America, and the Dominican Republic (n = 12,797), the 1999­2000 study estimates
indicate that higher levels of religious practice are inversely associated with the earliest stages of tobacco and
cannabis experiences (i.e., the first chance to try and the first actual use) but not so for alcohol. To illustrate, for
each unit increase in levels of religious practice behaviors, there was an associated reduced occurrence of the
first chance to try tobacco (odds ratio = 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.62, 0.94). Occurrence of first actual use
of tobacco and cannabis was not associated with levels of religious practice behaviors among youths exposed to
the opportunity to try these drugs. As such, these behaviors apparently have not strengthened resistance. Rather,
autarcesis may be at work, functioning to shield youths from drug exposure opportunities.

The main aim of this study is to estimate the degree to
which engagement in religious activities might shield or
otherwise protect youths from the earliest stages of drug
involvement versus an alternative resistance-strengthening
mechanism of protection. Background for this research
includes more than a century of epidemiologic studies on the
topic of health and religion (e.g., denominational affiliation:
Catholic vs. Protestant and so on). During the 20th century,
the concept of religiosity was broadened to encompass a
behavioral facet (e.g., frequency of church attendance) and a
psychological facet (e.g., level of personal commitment to
the deity), as well as religion-associated diet or health prac-
tices such as circumcision (1).
Religiosity in these facets has links to an array of mental
health-related conditions and behaviors, including drug
involvement (1­8). For example, Miller et al. (3) studied a
large epidemiologic sample of adolescents in the United
States and found lower occurrence of drug-related clinical
problems among youths with high values on religious devo-
tion. We appreciate religiosity as a multidimensional
construct that encompasses, at minimum, both behavioral
facets and psychological facets (1, 3, 8). Nonetheless, epide-
miologic studies of health and religiosity often have
neglected this multidimensional character; religiosity is
often assessed by a single interview or questionnaire item
(9). Even when religiosity is conceptualized and measured as
a multidimensional concept, investigators tend to examine
one dimension at a time, neglecting the other dimensions of
religiosity (3, 10). Beyond issues of conceptualization and
measurement of religiosity, another important issue in this
line of research involves possible reciprocities such as might
arise when effects of drug use include disengagement from
previously valued facets of religiosity. These reciprocities
become especially challenging when investigators study reli-

giosity and the later stages of drug involvement, such as the
risk of developing drug dependence syndromes or drug prob-
lems (3).
Mindful of issues such as these, we laid a plan to study
religiosity as a multidimensional construct, with an effort to
constrain possible reciprocities via a focus on the earliest
stages of drug involvement, termed "drug exposure opportu-
nities" (11, 12). Drug exposure opportunities typically occur
at or near the time of a young person's first chance to try a
drug. Borrowing the useful concept of "autarcesis" from the
early days of infectious disease epidemiology (13), our
thesis is that adolescent religious practice behaviors may
have autarceologic properties, functioning to shield youths
from risk of harm, especially when there is a tangible
"agent" in the pathogenesis, etiology, and natural history of
a health condition. If religious behaviors are associated
inversely with the occurrence of youthful drug use, one
possibility is that these behaviors strengthen resistance once
a chance to try the drug occurred (e.g., resistance against
peer pressure to try drugs). A second possibility is that these
behaviors have shielded the youths from chances to try
drugs. It is in this second sense that these religious behaviors
would be serving an autarceologic function that can be
distinguished from the separate resistance-strengthening
functions often stressed in drug prevention programs.
Analogous to standard epidemiologic case-control study
procedures with a focus on the most recent incident cases of
disease and nondiseased controls, our study focus is upon
"recent-onset" cases of drug involvement (i.e., youths who
first had a chance to try drugs within the 0­23 months prior
to recruitment) and corresponding controls (i.e., youths who
never have had a chance to try these drugs). This approach
provides odds ratio estimates of the suspected protective
associations and places some constraints upon the possible
reciprocal processes through which actual drug use might
influence religious practice behaviors or other dimensions of
religiosity. The resulting odds ratio estimates are an approx-
imation of estimates that might be achieved in a prospective
study on this topic (14).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Our epidemiologic data are from a study conducted during
1999­2000 within Panama, the five Spanish heritage coun-
tries of Central America (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras,
Nicaragua, Costa Rica), and la Republica Dominicana. The
study takes its name as an acronym for these countries (PA +
CA + RDO) and is referred to as the "PACARDO" project;
it has been described in prior detailed reports (15). In brief,
this project involved an application of multistage probability
sampling methods, which yielded a self-weighting sample of
schools, and youths attending these schools, within each
country. Within each sampled school, 1­3 classrooms were
sampled at random from a roster of all classrooms with
pupils who were 16 years of age. All designated sample
classrooms participated. In aggregate, there was close to 100
percent school-level participation (96 percent). The research
protocol included "passive" parental consent (via letters sent
home) and active youth assent. A total of 12,797 school-
attending youth respondents participated in the PACARDO
survey project as the lead assessor read aloud each
preworded standardized item; more than 98 percent of
eligible youths participated (15). The protocol was approved
by institutional review boards for human subjects' protection
in each country and at Johns Hopkins University.
The standardized items of the PACARDO questionnaire
were subject to a translation, back-translation, and harmoni-
zation process that involved all the leaders on the research
teams, as well as pilot testing within these seven Latin Amer-
ican countries. The assessment plan involved a visit to each
classroom by a pair of trained assessors, who worked to
develop trust and rapport, secure youth assent, and admin-
ister the anonymous questionnaire during an hour-long
session while the teacher was absent from the classroom.
The questionnaire included separate modules to assess the
adolescent behavioral repertoire and drug experiences.
For this study, we excluded 1) 43 respondents (0.5
percent) whose questionnaires indicated an age less than 12
years or more than 20 years for focus on school-attending
youths' experiences within these countries; 2) 97 respon-
dents who reported use of "cadrina" (a nonexistent drug);
and 3) 68 participants whose responses about the behavior
repertoire exhibited illogical patterns (e.g., having the same
participation frequency on all the items in the behavioral
repertoire assessment). The mean age of the resulting 12,589
respondents was 16 years, one half of the respondents were
female (n = 6,491, 51.6 percent), and about one third of the
respondents attended private school (31.7 percent).
Assessment of drug involvement
The primary response variables of interest have been
assessed by standardized anonymous questionnaire items on
adolescent drug involvement in relation to alcohol, tobacco,
and illegal drugs (e.g., cannabis). For each drug, "age of the
first chance to try" and "age of first use" were assessed sepa-
rately by questions in the following form (English transla-
tion): "Regarding the drug cannabis, how old were you when
you first had the chance to try cannabis?" and "How old were
you when you first used cannabis?" The time elapsed since
onset of drug exposure opportunity (in years) was estimated
by taking differences: age at assessment minus age at first
chance to try a drug. Using these standardized items and
difference scores, we identified recent-onset youths (differ-
ence = 0 or 1), youths with no such drug experiences, and
those whose experiences were in the more distant past
(difference > 1). Youths with onset in the more distant past
have been excluded from the analyses to constrain the poten-
tial reciprocities and other influences discussed in our intro-
duction. In the present study, the focus is upon the three most
commonly consumed drugs in this study population
(alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis). For these drugs, most
youths with past exposure opportunity (difference > 1)
already started use of one or more drugs (e.g., 83 percent of
respondents with past alcohol opportunity had started using
alcohol), and in this circumstance, the level of religiosity
might depend on the drug taking rather than vice versa.
Hence, in order to approximate estimates that might be found
1182 Chen et al.
Am J Epidemiol 2004;159:1180­1188
in a future prospective study, we focused our study solely on
the recent-onset youths, which constrains this possibility.
Measures of religiosity
Individual-level religiosity has been assessed by three
domains of standardized survey items: religious practice
behaviors, denomination, and devotion. To assess religious
behavioral repertoire as part of the more general adolescent
behavioral repertoire, we used the 25-item Behavioral
Repertoire Self-rating Scale of Johanson et al. (16). This
standardized measurement evaluates how the youths allo-
cated their time across a variety of activities. On this scale,
the four items on religious behavioral repertoire ask about
the time allocated to "praying/reading the Bible," "going to
church," "going to a religious revival," and "going to a reli-
gious retreat." Each item had eight response categories,
ranging from "not even once this year" to "more than once
each day." Prior latent variable analyses for discrete categor-
ical response variables disclosed that a religious activities
dimension is one of five main dimensions of the adolescent
behavioral repertoire as measured in this study (17). This
latent structure analysis also yielded a standardized factor
score for the religious practice behavior dimension, with an
observed range from ­0.86 (lowest) to 1.43 (highest) and a
mean of 0.02.
With respect to the denominational facet of religiosity,
three main subgroups were formed: "Catholic (reference
group)," "Protestant or other religions," and "none," on the
basis of each youth's response to a single question: "What is
your religion?" For assessment of the psychological facet of
religiosity, the youths have been sorted into two groups
according to their responses to two standardized binary
items, one on the importance of going to church on Sundays
and one on the importance of participating in church activi-
ties. One subgroup has a higher level of religious devotion
(two positive responses reported), and the other subgroup
has a lower level of religious devotion (only zero or one
positive response to these items).
Potentially confounding covariates under study
The school type (public/private) is from administrative
records, and all other potentially confounding variables were
assessed by self-report. We sorted these variables into three
main groups: Group I, the religious denomination and reli-
gious devotion variables already described in the section on
religiosity; Group II, exogenous sociodemographic covari-
ates, not likely to be influenced by drug use (age, sex,
parental education); and Group III, covariates that might be
endogenous with respect to drug use, including levels of
conduct problems, deviant peer affiliation, family attention,
family drug use, school adaptation, and four main dimen-
sions of adolescent behavioral repertoire (other than the reli-
gious practice dimension). The possibly endogenous
constructs include the following: 1) conduct problems,
assessed by 19 binary items (e.g., damaging other people's
belongings), with the Kuder-Richardson 20 estimate of
Cronbach's  (KR ) = 0.83; 2) deviant peer affiliation by a
13-item scale (KR  = 0.84); 3) family attention and moni-
toring using nine binary items such as, "Are your parents or
guardians often aware of where you are and what you are
doing?" (KR  = 0.70); 4) family drug use by four binary
items on illegal and legal drugs such as, "During the last 6
months, has any family member (mother, father, or sibling)
used tobacco (yes or no)?"; 5) school maladjustment by an
11-item scale with items such as, "Do you cut school more
than two days a month (true or false)?" (KR  = 0.73); and
6) social withdrawal by eight items such as, "Have you been
rejected by friends and other young people (yes or no)?" (KR
 = 0.62). The four other main dimensions of the adolescent
behavioral repertoire are a socializing activities dimension
(e.g., going out on a date), a sports-related activities dimen-
sion, a home-based activities dimension (e.g., spending time
with family), and a gender-associated socialization activities
dimension (e.g., taking care of children).
Statistical analyses
Descriptive analyses first were used to characterize youths
with and without recent-onset drug experiences in relation to
the sociodemographic variables under study. In data anal-
yses after the first data exploration steps and latent variable
analyses, we regressed the occurrence of recent-onset drug
experiences on three measures of religiosity (i.e., religious
practice behavior, religious devotion, and religious affilia-
tion), with the above-listed covariates held constant. The
ordinary multiple logistic regression model fails to address
the interdependent character of the PACARDO samples; for
example, the respondents' drug experiences within the same
school were more similar than those of students randomly
sampled from different schools. For this reason, we turned to
a series of generalized linear models with the logistic link
and a generalized estimating equations approach, building a
marginal model to account for the interdependence of
responses within the same school (18, 19). Here, an
exchangeable correlation structure has been assumed as a
starting specification for the model, but a robust estimation
approach guards against misspecification errors in this
respect. The strength of association between religiosity and
recent-onset drug experience is estimated by an odds ratio;
95 percent confidence intervals and p values convey the
precision of these estimates and strength of the evidence.
The generalized linear model (logit link) was implemented
via STATA version 7.0 software (20).
RESULTS
Within the sample of 12,589 youths, a total of 1,656
school-attending youths had just had the first chance to try
alcohol and 1,956 had recent onset of alcohol use. The corre-
sponding numbers are 973 and 1,051 for tobacco and 495
and 307 for cannabis. The ratios of these drug-specific
numbers reflect the lag time between the first chance to try a
drug and the first actual use of the drug. A sizeable number
of youths had a past history of the chance to try the drug but
did not start actual use of the drug until recently. As depicted
in table 1, the mean age of these drug-experienced youths
(and the drug-naive youths) is about 15­16 years. Recent-
onset drug use was more common among males, youths with

higher levels of paternal education, and those attending
private school.
Table 2 depicts the cross-tabulation for each dimension of
religiosity in relation to the occurrence of drug-specific
experiences, as well as crude association estimates obtained
from the regression analyses. In general, the occurrence of
recent-onset alcohol experiences was found to vary inversely
with the levels of religious behavioral repertoire. For
example, the odds of recent-onset chance to try alcohol were
about 70 percent lower for each standard deviation increase
in levels of religious practice activities (estimated odds ratio
(OR) = 0.71, 95 percent confidence interval (CI): 0.64, 0.79;

dimension and the occurrence of actual alcohol use has
almost the same strength (OR = 0.71, 95 percent CI: 0.64,
0.78; p < 0.001). In addition, the odds of recent-onset alcohol
use were lower for youths with a higher level of religious
devotion as compared with youths with a lower level of
devotion (OR = 0.64, 95 percent CI: 0.58, 0.71; p < 0.001).
Being a Protestant or member of some other (non-Catholic)
religion showed an inverse association as well, as gauged
against the odds of alcohol involvement for the Catholic
majority reference group.
With respect to recent-onset tobacco involvement, there
were inverse associations in relation to the levels of religious
practice behaviors (opportunity: OR = 0.61, 95 percent CI:
0.54, 0.69; p < 0.001; initiation: OR = 0.55, 95 percent CI:

tion: OR = 0.59, 95 percent CI: 0.51, 0.67; p < 0.001), and
religious affiliation with Protestant or other religions versus
Catholic affiliates (opportunity: OR = 0.62, 95 percent CI:
0.54, 0.72; p < 0.001; initiation: OR = 0.56, 95 percent CI:
0.49, 0.64; p < 0.001). However, youths with no religious
affiliation had a modestly higher odds of recent-onset first
chance to try tobacco (OR = 1.46, 95 percent CI: 1.18, 1.81;
p = 0.001), as well as recent-onset first use of tobacco (OR =
1.67, 95 percent CI: 1.38, 2.01; p < 0.001).
Higher levels of religiosity had inverse associations with
the odds of recent-onset cannabis involvement in the
domains of behavior and denomination. For example, youths
with higher levels of religious practice behavior tend to have
a lower odds of recent-onset cannabis experiences (opportu-
nity: OR = 0.48, 95 percent CI: 0.29, 0.58; p < 0.001; initia-
tion: OR = 0.31, 95 percent CI: 0.23, 0.43; p < 0.001).
As compared with the Catholic youths, those affiliated
with other religions had a lower odds to experience the two
earliest stages of alcohol and tobacco involvement. Never-

theless, youths without any religious affiliation were about
2­3 times more likely to have the first chance to try cannabis
as well as start cannabis use, as compared with Catholic
youths (opportunity: OR = 2.16, 95 percent CI: 1.67, 2.80;
p < 0.001; initiation: OR = 2.90, 95 percent CI: 2.17, 3.89;
p < 0.001).
Observed associations between the dimensions of religi-
osity and the occurrence of recent-onset drug experiences
were attenuated somewhat with statistical adjustment for
age, sex, paternal education, private school attendance,
family drug use, family attention, social withdrawal, conduct
problems, deviant peer affiliation, and the other four facets
of adolescent behavioral repertoire (table 3). For alcohol,
tobacco, and cannabis, the covariate-adjusted inverse associ-
ation between higher levels of religious behavior and the
earliest stages of drug involvement was most pronounced for
cannabis (opportunity: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.73, 95
percent CI: 0.56, 0.96; p = 0.02; initiation: aOR = 0.58, 95
percent CI: 0.39, 0.85; p = 0.005). In addition, youths with
higher levels of religious devotion were less likely to have
had recent-onset alcohol experiences (opportunity: aOR =
0.77, 95 percent CI: 0.64, 0.91; p = 0.003; initiation: aOR =
0.79, 95 percent CI: 0.67, 0.93; p = 0.006), but with covariate
adjustment there was no appreciable variation in the relation
to tobacco and cannabis. Patterns of association with reli-
gious denomination remain as they were reported based on
models without covariate adjustment.
To probe into possible autarceologic mechanisms versus
resistance-strengthening mechanisms underlying the
observed inverse associations, we respecified the analyses of
recent-onset drug use, conditioning on the occurrence of a
recent chance to try the drug. The resulting conditional prob-
ability reflects a transition from drug exposure opportunity
to actual drug use. As displayed in the final column of table
3, in this analysis we see an essentially null association
linking levels of religious behavior practices to the odds of
recent-onset alcohol use among youth with a recent-onset
chance to try alcohol (aOR = 0.78, 95 percent CI: 0.47, 1.29;
p = 0.33). The associations also are null for tobacco (aOR =
0.98, 95 percent CI: 0.61, 1.58; p = 0.94) and for cannabis
(aOR = 0.62, 95 percent CI: 0.31, 1.26; p = 0.18). Affiliation
as a Protestant or as a member of the other (non-Catholic)
religions was associated with a lower odds of a transition
from first alcohol exposure opportunity to actual use of
alcohol (aOR = 0.53, 95 percent CI: 0.33, 0.86; p = 0.01).
Whereas our regression models held constant nonconfor-
mity and rule-breaking behaviors by a 19-item scale devised
to measure conduct problems, we also examined whether the
observed associations might be different for youths who
experienced their first drug exposure opportunities in child-
hood and early adolescence, by repeating the analysis for the

subsample of adolescent respondents aged 15 years or less at
the time of assessment. Estimates based on this subsample
were consistent with estimates for the sample as a whole:
Higher levels of religious practice behaviors are associated
with a lower odds of recent-onset drug experiences, but not
with reduced conditional probability of drug use, once drug
exposure opportunity has occurred. Additional subsidiary
analyses were conducted with a focus on the youths who had
experienced the most recently incident drug experiences
(i.e., age at assessment equal to the age at first drug exposure
opportunity). Whereas the resulting estimates are not shown
in a table, these analyses disclosed a pattern of associations
linking religiosity and drug involvement not appreciably
different from the patterns summarized above.
DISCUSSION
The main findings from this study of religiosity and
youthful drug involvement may be summarized as follows:
1) higher levels of religious practice behaviors are inversely
associated with the earliest stages of tobacco and cannabis
experiences (i.e., the first chance to try and the first actual
use); 2) youths with higher levels of religious devotion are
less likely to have exposure opportunity to alcohol, as well as
the first actual use of alcohol; this is not the case for tobacco
or for cannabis; 3) as compared with Catholic affiliates,
being a Protestant or a member of some other religion is
inversely associated with recent-onset experiences of
alcohol and tobacco; 4) for youths without religious affilia-
tion, there was an excess occurrence of cannabis use; and 5)
religious practice behaviors and levels of religious devotion
are not associated with a rapid transition from the chance to
try alcohol or tobacco to the first use of these drugs. Rather,
it appears that these facets of religiosity are inversely associ-
ated with youthful tobacco and cannabis involvement by
virtue of reduced occurrence of the first chance to try these
drugs. This finding is consistent with the idea that religious
practice behaviors may have protective effects that shield
youths from contact with the chance to try tobacco or
cannabis (i.e., consistent with "autarcesis" mechanisms), but
these behaviors do not necessarily influence the youth's
decision to consume the drugs once the opportunity to do so
has occurred (i.e., inconsistent with the separate "resistance-
strengthening" mechanisms).
Some potential limitations of this study should be consid-
ered before detailed discussion. First, a major issue involves
specification of the survey population in relation to school-
attending youths. School attendance is determined by several
factors, including teenager attributes, household characteris-
tics, and environmental contexts, some of which also have
been found as correlates for religious engagement as well as
occurrence of drug-related experiences (1, 5, 21­24). As a
result, there are limits when generalizing these findings to
nonschool samples, such as dropouts, or nonattending
youths. In addition, because of cultural, geographic, societal,
and racial/ethnic compositional differences, we cannot
assertively generalize these findings outside the region of the
seven PACARDO countries. Replication elsewhere is
needed. We also note that the within-country sample sizes
were too small for replication of all these analyses at the
individual country level; results on the epidemiology of
youthful drug involvement for the individual countries have
been presented elsewhere, although not with a focus on reli-
giosity issues (15).
Second, an important methodological issue in the present
study is that all the information is assessed by self-report.
Some studies have shown that self-report of alcohol and
other drug use from adolescent samples is basically reliable
and stable (25, 26), but validity is a concern (27, 28). A
number of bioassays have been developed to measure drug
taking within days or months of actual use (29), but these
tests do not entrap the time interval of interest here (0­23
months prior to survey), nor do they reflect exposure to first
chances to try each drug, which was our primary topic of
inquiry (i.e., drug opportunity). In addition, these biologic
methods may not yet be feasible in large-sample cross-
national survey research.
Third, we held constant most of the prominent peer and
parental influences on adolescent drug involvement by
regression modeling. In future research, it should be possible
to improve the measurements and to hold constant even
more suspected confounding variables (e.g., youth confor-
mity with family rules about behaviors). Finally, perhaps the
most serious methodological issues in this study can be
traced to its cross-sectional and nonexperimental design,
which creates opportunities for errors in the specification of
temporal sequences and which opens up opportunities for
reciprocal influences. Because of potential reciprocities in
these associations, it will be useful to examine these relations
in the context of longitudinal research with multiple points
of measurement for drug experiences and multidimensional
religiosity. Nonetheless, estimates from cross-sectional and
retrospective research are invaluable as a step forward
toward prospective and longitudinal studies.
Notwithstanding limitations such as these, our study in
seven Latin American countries suggests that links between
religiosity and drug-related experiences depend upon the
facet of religiosity, the drugs under study, and stage of drug
involvement, a pattern of findings consistent with prior work
in the United States (3, 30). For example, we found that
"psychological religiosity" was inversely associated with the
occurrence of alcohol initiation and the odds of alcohol
opportunity, the earliest stage of drug experiences. However,
for the behavioral facet of religiosity (religious practice), the
observed links are mainly with tobacco and cannabis experi-
ences. The association between religious practice and
alcohol experiences is quite modest in these study data,
perhaps because alcoholic beverage consumption is often
integrated within family and community life in Latin
America (31).
On this basis, one may surmise that more frequent practice
of religious behaviors can 1) help shield youths from drug-
using youths and 2) bring youths into spheres of adult (e.g.,
pastoral) influences that may serve their own protective
functions (32). Here, also, it is pertinent that the observed
association between religion/religiosity and drug experi-
ences might be due to selective processes associated with
personal characteristics (e.g., personality traits) (23, 33).
Twin studies have suggested that religiosity in the form of
religious upbringing and religious practice might shape the
Religiosity and Adolescent Drug Involvement 1187
Am J Epidemiol 2004;159:1180­1188
display of personality traits (e.g., sensation seeking) and also
might modify liabilities to initiate drug use (34, 35).
In sum, there are numerous theories and mechanisms
posited to explain the presumed beneficial effects of reli-
gious practice or beliefs on mental health and behavior (36,
37), but this study's evidence is more consistent with our
thesis about the "shielding" mechanisms of behavioral autar-
cesis and less consistent with "resistance-strengthening"
mechanisms. If the effects of religiosity are operating via
"resistance" mechanisms at the point of the chance to try
drugs, then we should be seeing an inverse association that
links higher levels of religiosity with lower conditional prob-
ability of drug use, once the chance to try drugs has occurred.
Instead, the pattern of evidence is one of null associations
with this conditional probability. Inverse associations, when
observed, pertain to the occurrence of the first chance to try
the drug (i.e., consistent with "autarceologic" shielding).
It is possible that the autarceologic functions of religious
practice behaviors with respect to the first chance to try
drugs may be due to time displacement. For example,
adolescents who attend church-related services on a regular
basis may have fewer opportunities to get in touch with peers
outside this particular social network, because of preoccupa-
tion with religion-related activities. In this situation, the salu-
tary effects of religious behaviors may actually be partially
due to the mediational effects of attenuated affiliation with
peers who have started to use drugs and greater participation
in pro-social behavior. Multiwave longitudinal data are
needed to assess these conceptualizations about processes
and sequences that link the multiple dimensions of religi-
osity with these earliest stages of drug involvement in
adolescence.
