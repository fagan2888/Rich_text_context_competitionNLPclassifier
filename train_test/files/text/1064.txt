Objective: To determine whether maternal depressive
symptoms, reported when infants are 2 to 4 months old,
are associated with mothers' early parenting practices.
Design: Secondary data analyses collected from the Na-
tionalEvaluationofHealthyStepsforYoungChildren.Data
sources included newborn enrollment questionnaires and
parentinterviewswheninfantswere2to4monthsold.Ma-
ternal depressive symptoms were assessed using the Cen-
ter for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale.
Setting: Twenty-four pediatric practices across the United
States.
Participants: A total of 5565 families enrolled in Healthy
Steps; 4874 mothers (88%) completed 2- to 4-month in-
terviews and provided Center for Epidemiologic Stud-
ies Depression Scale data; 17.8% of mothers reported hav-
ing depressive symptoms.
Main Outcome Measures: Ten parenting practices
assessed in 3 domains: safety (sleep position and low-
ering water temperature), feeding (cereal, water, or
juice; continuing breastfeeding), and practices to pro-
mote child development (showing books, playing with
infant, talking to infant, and following 2 or more rou-
tines).
Results: Mothers with and without depressive symp-
toms reported similar uses of safety and feeding prac-
tices. Mothers with depressive symptoms had reduced
odds of continuing breastfeeding (adjusted odds ratio
[AOR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-0.88),
showing books (AOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.97), play-
ing with the infant (AOR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54-0.90), talk-
ing to the infant (AOR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63-0.86), and fol-
lowing routines (AOR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.52-0.72).
Conclusion: Maternal depressive symptoms are com-
mon in early infancy and contribute to unfavorable parent-
ing practices.

DEPRESSION IS A PREVALENT
health problem among
women of childbearing
age, with mothers of in-
fants and young children
being at particular risk in part because of
the routine demands of parenting.1 Preva-
lence rates vary depending on the popula-
tion being studied. The prevalence of de-
pressive symptoms among mothers of
children younger than 3 years ranged from
19% to 24% in 2 nationally representative
USsamples.1,2 Forlow-incomemotherswith
young children, depressive symptoms are
more prevalent,3-5 whereas longitudinal
studiesofpregnantandpostpartumwomen
consistently find that 9% to 12% of moth-
ers have depressive symptoms.6-8
Many investigators, using both obser-
vational and interview methods, have dem-
onstrated that maternal depressive symp-
toms are related to adverse caregiving and
health-related behaviors, which in turn in-
fluence children's health and develop-
ment.9-12 A meta-analysis13 of small direct-
observation studies found associations
between maternal depression and im-
paired parenting, especially among moth-
ers of infants. Depressed mothers were less
likely to engage in positive behaviors dur-
ing play and feeding opportunities and
were more likely to be disengaged and dis-
play higher levels of hostile behaviors.

early parenting behaviors. Using a community sample of
low-income women, the presence of postpartum depres-
sive symptoms was associated with decreased odds of hav-
ingasmokedetectororplacingtheinfantonhisorherback
to sleep and increased odds of using corporal punishment
duringthefirstyearoflife.5 Smallerdirect-observationstud-
ies have found that depressed mothers were less likely to
engage in positive developmental behaviors during early
interactions, such as talking, playing, or being affection-
ate with their newborns, and were more likely to display
anger and disengagement.16-18
The science of early development is clear about the im-
portance of parenting and early caregiving relationships,
especially during infancy, when there is total depen-
dency for safety, health, protection, nurturing, and stabil-
ity.9,11 Infants'earlydevelopmentalsodependsonthehealth
and well-being of their parents. When a mother is coping
with postpartum depressive symptoms, it places a bur-
den on the caregiving relationship at a time when early
patterns of parenting are established.9,11,19 Despite this fact,
we are unaware of any studies that have used a diverse,
large nationwide sample to determine whether the pres-
ence of depressive symptoms in mothers is associated with
a broad array of caregiving practices related to health and
development in the postpartum period.
In this study, we examined whether maternal depres-
sive symptoms at 2 to 4 months post partum are associ-
ated with parenting practices in a large nationwide sample
of mothers and infants. We posited that depressive symp-
toms exhibited in the early months of caring for an in-
fant were associated with lower levels of engagement in
positive parenting behaviors to promote child health and
development. The diversity and size of our sample al-
lowed us to address limitations of smaller studies and ad-
just for possible confounders of the relationship be-
tween maternal depressive symptoms and parenting
practices. We examined 10 parenting practices that fall
into 3 domains: safety practices, feeding practices, and
behaviors that promote early development. Extensive evi-
dence, professional guidelines, and the American Acad-
emy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy statements highlight the
importance of these practices.11,20-27
METHODS
SAMPLE
Data for this study were obtained from a sample of interven-
tion and control group families at 15 sites across the United
States that participated in the National Evaluation of Healthy
Steps for Young Children.28 Healthy Steps is a new model of
pediatric care that incorporates child development specialists
and enhanced developmental services into pediatric practices
that serve families with young children. The design was a ran-
domization trial at 6 sites (up to 400 enrolled) and quasi-
experimental at 9 sites (up to 200 enrolled at the intervention
site and 200 at the comparison site). Sites began staggered en-
rollment in September 1996 with completion at the last site in
November 1998.
Newborns whose families intended to use the Healthy Steps
sites for their care were enrolled consecutively in the hospital
at birth or at the first office visit within the first 4 weeks of life.
Newborns were ineligible if they did not complete an office visit
within the first 4 weeks, they were to be adopted or placed in
foster care, their mother did not speak English or Spanish, or
their parents expected to move within 6 months. The eligible
sample for the analyses reported in this article included moth-
ers who completed forms at enrollment and a telephone inter-
view at 2 to 4 months and who provided self-reported data of
depressive symptoms using a 14-item modified Center for Epi-
demiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) at 2 to 4 months.
DATA SOURCES
Two data sources, available in English and Spanish, were used.
The first was a short questionnaire completed by parents at the
time of entry into Healthy Steps; this questionnaire provided ma-
ternal and family demographic characteristics. The second was
a computer-assisted Healthy Steps telephone interview con-
ducted with the mother (virtually all respondents) when the child
was2to4monthsofage.Thestructuredinterviewincludedques-
tions about the presence of depressive symptoms, early parent-
ing practices, and additional demographic characteristics.29
The 10 early parenting practices included in this study were
selected from 17 parenting practices included in the Healthy
Steps interview. They were selected based on evidence of their
importance for child health and development, near complete
data, and variability at 2 to 4 months. Two dichotomous vari-
ables were chosen to assess infant safety practices: using the
prone sleep position at both naptime and bedtime and lower-
ing the temperature of the hot water heater in the home. Plac-
ing an infant to sleep in the supine or stomach position is as-
sociated with sudden infant death syndrome, the leading cause
of postneonatal mortality in the United States.30 Since 1992, the
AAP has recommended that newborns be placed on their backs
to sleep.21 Lowering the hot water temperature is an impor-
tant preventive safety measure to decrease tap water scald burns,
especially among infants and young children.25,31,32
The 4 infant feeding practices included continuation of
breastfeeding at 2 to 4 months among mothers who had ever
put the infant to the breast and whether or not the infant had
been given water, juice, or cereal during the last week. The AAP
advises that breast milk or infant formula provides sufficient
nutrients in the first 4 to 6 months. Breastfeeding is associated
with decreased infectious and chronic diseases and has shown
a modest positive influence on infant cognitive develop-
ment.24,33 The early use of juice in the diet can result in insuf-
ficient nutrition, dental caries, and short stature34; early water
use is associated with electrolyte imbalance and can lead to wa-
ter intoxication and even death35; and there is no nutritional
indication to introduce cereal before the age of 4 months.36 Four
practices to foster healthy development included showing books
daily to the infant, playing daily with the infant, talking daily
to the infant while working in the home, and following 2 or
more routines at meals, naptime, and bedtime. To promote de-
velopment, showing books from infancy onward has been posi-
tively associated with subsequent language acquisition and
school achievement.37,38 The 3 other parenting practices--
talking to, playing with, and establishing predictable routines
for infants--provide important opportunities to stimulate cog-
nitive, social, physical, and emotional development.37,39
The presence of maternal depressive symptoms was mea-
sured in the 2- to 4-month interview using a modified version
of the CES-D. The CES-D is a 20-item self-report scale de-
signed to measure the frequency of depressive symptoms ex-
perienced in the previous week.40 Using the modified 14-item
CES-D, scores of 11 or higher indicated the presence of ma-
ternal depressive symptoms; this value was calibrated against
the cutoff of 16 used for the 20-item scale. Correlation of the
reduced-item version with the full 20-item scale exceeded 0.95
in a sample of high-risk pregnant women.41 The  coefficient

for the 14-item CES-D for Healthy Steps mothers was .85, simi-
lar to that for the total scale for the general population.40
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We used 2 statistics to compare parenting practices among
mothers with and without depressive symptoms at 2 to 4 months
post partum. Multiple logistic regression models were used to
estimate the overall unadjusted and adjusted relations of the
presence of maternal depressive symptoms with parenting prac-
tices. These models assessed whether differences by depres-
sive symptoms were due to covariates that may potentially be
associated with both depressive symptoms and parenting prac-
tices. These covariates were mother's age, race, ethnicity, mari-
tal or partner status, level of education, and employment sta-
tus; whether she was a first-time mother; father's employment
status; household income; whether the family owned their home;
and child's age (Table 1).
In addition, because of a possible correlation of observa-
tions among families receiving pediatric care at the same site,
multiple logistic regression analyses were also adjusted for the
site of health care and enrollment in the Healthy Steps inter-
vention group. Analyses were conducted using SAS statistical
software, version 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
STUDY SAMPLE
A total of 5565 families completed enrollment forms; 4891
mothers (87.9%) completed the 2- to 4-month survey,
and 4874 (87.6%) also provided depressive symptom data.
When compared with nonresponders, mothers in the
sample were more likely to be older than 20 years, white,
non-Hispanic, married, and high school graduates and
to report that the infant's father was employed.
Table 1 shows the percentage of women with depres-
sive symptoms by demographic characteristics and the
distribution of the demographic characteristics for the
total sample. At 2 to 4 months post partum, 17.8% of
mothers reported depressive symptoms. Mothers who
were younger than 20 years, from a minority back-
ground, Hispanic, and not living with the biological fa-
ther of the child, who had low incomes, and who had
less than a high school education were more likely to re-
port depressive symptoms than mothers without these
characteristics (Table 1). Depressive symptoms were not
associated with mothers being employed or parity.
SAFETY PRACTICES
Significantly fewer mothers with depressive symptoms
than mothers without depressive symptoms lowered
the temperature on water heaters (24.3% vs 31.0%)
(Table 2). Comparable percentages used the wrong sleep
position (14.3% vs 11.9%). The unadjusted odds ratios
for lowering temperature on the water heater indicated
decreased odds for mothers with depressive symptoms;
however, it was not significant when adjusted for covar-
iates (Table 3).
FEEDING PRACTICES
The frequencies of less-than-optimal newborn feeding
practices at 2 to 4 months (giving cereal, water, or juice)
differed between mothers with and without depressive
symptoms, ranging from 11.9% to 40.0% in mothers with-
out depressive symptoms and 16.8% to 50.5% in moth-
ers with depressive symptoms (Table 2). Although the
unadjusted regression model indicated that mothers with
depressive symptoms had increased odds of engaging in

these practices, the adjusted odds ratios for these vari-
ables were not significant (Table 3). Among mothers who
had ever breastfed (76% for women without depressive
symptoms and 71% for women with depressive symp-
toms), mothers with depressive symptoms had more than
one-quarter reduced odds of continuing to breastfeed at
2 to 4 months compared with mothers without depres-
sive symptoms (Tables 2 and 3).
DEVELOPMENTAL PRACTICES
Smaller percentages of mothers with depressive symp-
toms reported positive developmental parenting prac-
tices than mothers without symptoms; the odds of each
practice also differed significantly in both the unad-
justed and adjusted logistic regression models. Playing
with the infant was the most frequent developmental prac-
tice, with 87.4% of mothers with depressive symptoms
and 91.9% of mothers without depressive symptoms re-
porting they played with their infant at least once a day
(Table 2). Frequencies of the 3 other developmental prac-
tices ranged from 28.2% to 66.9% in mothers without de-
pressive symptoms and from 22.4% to 59.6% in moth-
ers with depressive symptoms (Table 2). After adjusting
for covariates, mothers with depressive symptoms had
19% reduced odds of showing a book to their infants at
least once a day, one-quarter reduced odds of playing with
their infant at least once a day and talking to their in-
fants while working in the home, and one-third re-
duced odds of following 2 or more daily routines (Table 3).
COMMENT
The findings from this study provide a snapshot of early
parenting practices among mothers with depressive symp-
toms in the critical first months post partum. Although we
posited that there would be a significant relation between
each of the parenting practices and the presence of mater-
naldepressivesymptoms,wefoundthatthesafetyandfeed-
ing practices did not vary by depressive symptoms, after
adjustment for covariates, with 1 exception. After control-
ling for covariates, we found that mothers with depressive
symptoms had decreased odds of continuing breastfeed-
ing. Our breastfeeding findings are different from those re-
ported by Chung et al,5 who found no difference in breast-
feeding duration for longer than 1 month. Their study used
a smaller, community-based low-income sample, whereas
this study used a larger, diverse national sample.
After adjusting for covariates, we also found that moth-
erswithdepressivesymptomshaddecreasedoddsofshow-
ing picture books, playing and talking with their infants,
and following daily routines. These findings suggest that
parentingpracticesthatrequiremoreactiveinteractionwith
infants, such as continuing breastfeeding and playing or
talking with the infant, were reduced. Similar results have

been found in direct-observation studies of mothers.13,16
As other experts have noted, the presence of elevated ma-
ternal depressive symptoms often results in the increased
feelings of hopelessness and helplessness that can discour-
age mothers from engaging in parenting practices that have
less concrete tangible outcomes.42
In this study, although depressive symptoms did not
appear to influence several preventive parenting prac-
tices for mothers with newborns after adjustment for co-
variates, other studies2 with mothers of toddlers found
differences in practices such as car seat use and cover-
ing electrical outlets. This may be due to the more de-
manding nature of parenting toddlers. In both studies,
however, the presence of depressive symptoms resulted
in reduced odds of mothers showing books or reading
to their children on a daily basis, a parenting behavior
that requires more sustained interaction from the mother.
Several limitations to this study should be noted. First,
self-report measures of parenting may lead to overreport-
ing of behaviors that are socially desirable among mothers
whodonothavedepressivesymptoms.Inthisstudy,which
used a broad array of parenting practices, we have no evi-
dence of overstating for mothers with or without depres-
sive symptoms. Among mothers with depressive symp-
toms, the bias may be in the opposite direction, with the
depressive symptoms leading to underestimates of actual
parenting practices as a result of feelings of decreased self-
efficacy about parenting ability.2 However, the review by
Richters43 of 22 studies suggests that depressed mothers
do not have distorted perceptions of their children. In ad-
dition, D'Souza-Vazirani et al44 found no difference in the
validity of maternal report for children's short-term health
careusebasedonthepresenceofmaternaldepressivesymp-
toms. Our study findings suggest that it is possible to iden-
tify reduced positive parenting practices among mothers
with depressive symptoms without having to use expen-
sivedirect-observationmeasures.Althougharecentstudy45
suggests variability in the validity of self-reported home
safety practices, lowering water temperature was among
the more reliable measures and sleep position was not as-
sessed.
Second, we used a self-report measure for depressive
symptoms as opposed to a structured diagnostic instru-
ment. Nevertheless, prior studies2 have found signifi-
cant relationships between diminished parenting and self-
reported depressive symptoms and suggest that the
nondiagnostic CES-D may be more appropriate and pref-
erable for pediatric practice and policy.
The findings from this study offer important impli-
cations for pediatric health care professionals and prac-
tice. The first is the need to screen for maternal depres-
sive symptoms among all mothers during the postpartum
period, when parenting practices are being established
and when pediatric practices have frequent contact with
families to provide guidance. Experts have stated that the
scope of professional responsibility for pediatric physi-
cians includes universal screening, guidance, and refer-
rals for maternal depression.2,20,46,47 The US Preventive Ser-
vices Task Force has recommended 2-item screeners by
primary care professionals to detect depressive symp-
toms.48 A recent study49 in a busy urban pediatric prac-
tice found a significant increase in the detection of de-
pressive symptoms among mothers during the first
postpartum year following implementation of a uni-
versal postpartum depression screening during well-
child care visits. Second, the challenge and opportu-
nity for pediatricians when providing anticipatory
guidance to mothers with depressive symptoms are to
discuss the mother's engagement in parenting prac-
tices that require more ongoing interactions, such as
continuing breastfeeding, playing, talking, providing
routines, and showing books.
The results of this study add to the burgeoning evi-
dence that highlights the importance of screening for
maternal depressive symptoms in the postpartum period.
Once depressive symptoms are identified, pediatric health
care professionals have an important role in providing on-
going counseling and anticipatory guidance to enhance pa-
rental efficacy, as well as in referring mothers to appropri-
ate health care professionals to assist with their depressive
symptoms.4,50 To maximize pediatric physician interac-
tions with mothers with depressive symptoms, further ef-
forts are needed to ensure that linkages exist between adult
and pediatric systems of care and that communities have
adequate mental health resources. Such an approach has
the potential to foster positive parenting, child health and
development, and family well-being.
