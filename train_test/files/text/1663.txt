Abuse of prescription opioids is a growing problem. The
number of methadone pain pills distributed now exceeds liq-
uid methadone used in opioid treatment, and the increases
in buprenorphine indicators provide evidence of the need to
monitor and intervene to decrease the abuse of this drug.
The need for additional and improved data to track trends
is discussed, along with findings as to the characteristics of
the users and combinations of drugs. Data on toxicities re-
lated to methadone or buprenorphine, particularly in combi-
nation with other prescribed drugs, are presented and clinical
implications and considerations are offered. These findings
underscore the need for physicians to be aware of potential
toxicities and to educate their patients regarding these issues.

INTRODUCTION
Abuse of prescription opioids, pain medications, is a
growing problem.1­3 The number of Drug Abuse Warning
Network (DAWN) emergency department visits for opi-
ates/opioids increased by 81% between 2004 and 2007,4
and the increase is seen in both those opiate drugs that
have been on the market for many years and in the newer
drugs. DAWN emergency department cases with a mention
of hydrocodone singly or in combinations increased from
80,291 in 2004 to 153,456 in 2007 and methadone increased
from 48,864 to 69,506. In comparison, buprenorphine and
its combinations increased from 1,001 to 10,229 cases. This
paper uses publicly available data to examine trends in the
use of methadone and buprenorphine in the United States,
the characteristics of the users, the formulations of the sub-
stances, and their use in combination with other drugs.

Understanding the reasons underlying increases in the
use of opioid medications can be complicated. There has
been little research on the factors involved in these ad-
verse events, such as the formulation of the opioid drug
(liquid, single ingredient or in combination), case type (sui-
cide, adverse reaction, etc.), underlying physical and mental
condition of the affected individual, combinations of drugs
involved (including serum levels and toxicology reports),
dosing instructions given to the patient, source of the drug,
reasons for use, and ease of access to nonprescribed phar-
maceutical drugs through illegal methods. Many of the new
drugs fall into International Classification of Diseases-10
(ICD-10)5 categories such as "Other Synthetic Narcotics,"
"Other Opioids," and "Other and Unspecified Narcotics,"
which currently do not provide data on a specific drug.
Thus, for this paper, a number of different data sources
have been accessed to try to understand this growing trend.
Buprenorphine was first marketed in the United States
in 1985 as a Schedule V narcotic analgesic. Until 2002,
it was only available as a low-dose (0.3 mg/ml) injectable
formulation under the brand name Buprenex®. In October
2002, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
two buprenorphine products (Suboxone® and Subutex®)
for the treatment of narcotic addiction. Both products are
high dose (2 mg and 8 mg) sublingual tablets. Subutex® is
a single entity buprenorphine product and Suboxone® is a
combination product with buprenorphine and naloxone in
a 4:1 ratio, respectively. Buprenorphine has been classified
as a Schedule III drug.
Methadone, a pharmaceutical opioid used in the treat-
ment of opioid dependence since 1964, is currently mar-
keted as oral concentrate (10 mg/ml), oral solution (5
and 10 mg/5 ml), tablet (5, 10, and 40 mg), injectable
(10 mg/ml), and powder (50, 100, and 500 mg/bottle for
prescription compounding). As of January 1, 2008, the
40 mg dispersible tablets (diskettes) are no longer approved
by the FDA for use in the management of pain. Methadone
is a Schedule II drug.

METHODOLOGY
Data from surveys, prescriptions, poison control centers,
emergency room visits, treatment admissions, deaths, retail
shipments, and toxicology laboratory data were retrieved
from online sources, special data runs by the agencies col-
lecting the data, and from agency publications. Very few of
the datasets could report whether or not the affected in-
dividuals had taken drugs prescribed for them. Texas data
were provided by the Department of State Health Services
and analysis was by the author. The U.S. treatment data as
collected in the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) was
available online and chi-square statistics were calculated
using the statistical programs included in the Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive.6 The DAWN and
the Researched Abuse, Diversion and Addiction-Related
Surveillance (RADARS®) were the only datasets available
for this paper that reported whether or not the cases in-
volved adverse reactions to the medicine prescribed for the
individual. In addition, the DAWN tables provided to the
author by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA) included measures of signifi-
cant changes over time.
SURVEY DATA
The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NS-
DUH) is conducted by the Office of Applied Studies of
SAMHSA. It collects information on the prevalence, pat-
terns, and consequences of alcohol, tobacco, and illegal
drug use and abuse in the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized
population, ages 12 and older. In 2008, a total of 68,736
individuals were sampled in this survey, which is represen-
tative of the U.S. general population.
The number of Americans who used pain relievers non-
medically in their lifetimes increased from 29.6 million in
2002 to 34.9 million in 2008. Some 928,000 of these individ-
uals reported lifetime use of methadone in 2002, compared
to 1.8 million in 2008. The prevalence of lifetime use of
methadone in 2007 was 0.5% for those in age group 12­
17 years, 2.0% for those in age group 18­25 years, and 0.5%
for 26 and older.7­10 The survey did not query for use of
buprenorphine.
PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN
SDI Vector® reported that the total number of prescrip-
tions filled at retail outlets for methadone increased from
863,039 in 2000 to 4,439,850 in 2008. The largest increase
was in prescriptions for the 10 mg tablet, which comprised
75% of the oral solid dose prescriptions in 2000 but in-
creased to 85% of the doses in 2008. The number of pre-
scriptions for Suboxone® increased from 225,014 in 2004
to 3,154,795 in 2008 and the number of prescriptions for
Subutex® increased from 42,211 to 263,878 in the same time
period. By 2008, the 8/2 mg formulation comprised 85%
of the Suboxone® prescriptions and the 8 mg formulation
comprised 71% of the Subutex® prescriptions.11
POISON CONTROL CENTER CALLS FOR HUMAN
EXPOSURE TO DRUGS
The National Poison Data System of the American As-
sociation of Poison Control Centers reported the number
of human exposure calls made about buprenorphine and
methadone to all poison control centers across the nation
(Table 1).
RADARS® collects data on acute and chronic exposures
from 47 of 60 U.S. poison centers. Table 2 shows the com-
binations of drugs in the calls to RADARS® in 2008 that
mentioned human exposure to methadone or buprenor-
phine12 as well as the combination of calls to Texas poison
control centers that reported human exposure to these two
drugs. The drugs in Table 2 are listed as they were reported
by the various datasets.
The number of calls to the Texas centers mentioning
buprenorphine increased from 18 in 1998 to 121 in 2008. Of

76 Buprenorphine and Methadone Use and Abuse January­February 2010
the 2008 buprenorphine calls, 95% involved Suboxone®, 2%
involved Subutex®, and 4% involved Buprenex®.13 From
1998 to 2008, the number of calls about 5 and 10 mg
methadone tablets increased from 29 to 870, while the num-
ber of calls involving 40 mg diskettes increased from 1 to
61 and the number involving liquid increased from 5 to 11.
The number of calls reporting an "unknown" methadone
formulation increased from 51 to 227 in this time
frame.
Of the 2008 human exposure calls to the Texas poison
centers, 52% of the buprenorphine cases and 43% of the
methadone cases were in females. The average age of those
exposed to buprenorphine was 34.9 years and for calls in-
volving methadone, 35.9 years.
EMERGENCY ROOM CASES
DAWN ED, which is conducted by SAMHSA, collects
data on drug-related visits to a sample of the nation's
emergency departments (EDs) and estimates the number
of drug-related ED visits for the United States. In 2007,
there were an estimated 3,998,228 drug-related ED visits,
and 483,612 involved narcotic analgesics. Between 2004
and 2007, the number of visits involving a mention of
methadone increased from 48,864 to 69,506 (p = .05), while
the number of visits involving buprenorphine alone or in
combination with naloxone increased from 1,001 to 10,229
(p = .002).14 There were 214,432 heroin cases in 2000 and
188,162 in 2007, a nonsignificant decrease.
In 2007, 43% of the methadone visit patients were fe-
males, 74% of visits were by Whites, while 9% were by
Blacks, and 6% were by Hispanics. Some 47% of the
buprenorphine visits involved females and 87% of visits
were by Whites; the proportions that were Black or His-
panic were not estimated because of the DAWN suppres-
sion rules regarding small numbers of cases or Relative
Standard Errors. For both substances, the highest rates of
visits were for those with age of 21­24 years, but overall,
FIGURE 1. Age groups of buprenorphine and methadone ED
visits: DAWN 2007.
the methadone patients were older, with higher rates con-
tinuing through ages 45­54 before declining (Fig. 1).
In terms of case type, 78% of the methadone visits in-
volved nonmedical use, which includes misuse or abuse,
taking a higher than prescribed or recommended dose of
a pharmaceutical, taking a pharmaceutical prescribed for
another individual, malicious poisoning of the patient by
another individual, and documented substance abuse in-
volving pharmaceuticals. Ten percent of the methadone
visits were seeking detoxification, 7% had an adverse re-
action in which the patient took his or her own medica-
tion as prescribed but had a reaction or side effect, and
5% involved a suicide attempt. For buprenorphine cases
(buprenorphine alone or in combination with naloxone),
70% involved nonmedical use and 16% involved adverse
reactions.15
The drugs most often mentioned in combination with
methadone or buprenorphine are listed in Table 2, and
between 2004 and 2007, significant increases were noted
in visits involving methadone in combination with other
pharmaceutical drugs (83% increase) and visits involving a
combination of methadone, alcohol, illicit drugs, and other
pharmaceuticals (233% increase) (Table 3).

FIGURE 2. U.S. treatment admissions by primary substance: TEDS 1992­2007.
TREATMENT
TEDS is SAMHSA's data system that collects informa-
tion on admissions to facilities that are licensed or certified
by the State substance abuse agencies. Depending on the
State's reporting requirements, private and for-profit facil-
ities that do not receive federal or state money may or may
not be included. Buprenorphine is one of the drugs included
in the "other opiate" category, but it cannot be specifically
identified in TEDS.
From 1992 to 2007, the number of persons who were
admitted to treatment programs across the United States
with a primary problem with opiates other than heroin or
methadone increased from 12,357 (0.8% of all admissions
in 1992) to 85,422 (4.7% in 2007) (Fig. 2). The number
of persons with a primary problem with heroin increased
from 168,321 (10.9% of all admissions) in 1992 to 246,871
(13.6%) in 2007, while the number of admissions for ille-
gal or street methadone increased from 1,198 (0.1% of all
admissions) in 1992 to 5,094 (0.3%) in 2007.16,17
In comparison to individuals entering treatment depen-
dent on heroin, individuals with a primary problem with
other opiates or street methadone were less likely to be male
or persons of color (Table 4). They were younger, less likely
to report currently injecting drugs, more likely to be first
admissions, were better educated, were more likely to be
employed, more likely to enter drug treatment with other
psychiatric problems, and more likely to have begun their
opiate use later.
Yet there have been some important shifts in the charac-
teristics of these populations, with the proportion of male
clients with a problem with illicit methadone decreasing
from 63% in 1992 to 53% in 2007 and the proportion of
male heroin clients increasing from 66% to 69%. The pro-
portion of White illicit methadone clients increased from
67% to 85%, the proportion of White other opiate clients
increased from 85% to 89%, and the proportion of White
heroin clients increased from 46% to 52% between 1992
and 2007. Injection as the current route of administration
has decreased: the proportions who reported injecting their
primary, secondary, or tertiary drug at admission dropped
between 1992 and 2007 from 74% to 64% for heroin clients,
from 33% to 15% for illicit methadone clients, and from
32% to 14% for other opiates. All changes were significant
at p < .0001.
The 2007 treatment clients reported very different pat-
terns in terms of their second problem drugs (Table 5). For
those with a primary problem with heroin, cocaine/crack
was the second most common drug problem, while for those
with a primary problem of nonprescription methadone,
other opiates were the second problem drugs. Those with
primary problems with other opiates were more likely to
report no other drug problem or to report problems with
alcohol, cocaine/crack, or marijuana.18
SAMHSA's 2007 National Survey of Substance Abuse
Treatment Services (N-SSATS), an annual census of 14,359
facilities providing substance abuse treatment, reported
that 23% of all clients in treatment were receiving buprenor-
phine or methadone, with 3,032 (1%) receiving buprenor-
phine and 262,684 (99%) receiving methadone.19 N-SSATS
does not survey those physicians who might be prescrib-
ing buprenorphine for opioid dependence in their private
practices.
The rates for receiving methadone or buprenorphine
treatment were higher in the northeast census region and
lowest in the midwest (Table 6).

DEATHS
Death data from the National Center for Health Statis-
tics (NCHS) are classified according to the ICD-10 codes,
which group drugs together into nonspecific codes that
may not identify the drugs separately. "Methadone" has
its own classification, but "Other Opioids" include mor-
phine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine, and percodan, as
well as other opioid formulations. "Other Synthetic Nar-
cotics" include buprenorphine, fentanyl, meperidine, and
propoxyphene, and "Other and Unspecified Narcotics" in-
cludes narcotics and opiates not otherwise categorized.
Thus, it is not currently possible to identify buprenor-
phine deaths from other deaths in the "Other Synthetic
Narcotics" category.
Of the illicit substances in poisoning deaths across the
United States, cocaine is the drug most likely to be men-
tioned, followed by "other opioids" (Fig. 3). Between
1999 and 2006, cocaine deaths increased from 3,832 to
7,475, other opioid deaths increased from 2,757 to 7,035,
methadone deaths increased from 786 to 5,416, and heroin
deaths increased from 1,964 to 2,090.20 Table 2 shows the
combinations of drugs reported nationally by NCHS in
deaths mentioning methadone.
Of the poisoning deaths with a mention of methadone
by age group in 2005, 13% were ages 15­24 years, 22% were
ages 25­34 years, 27% were ages 35­44 years, 29% were ages
45­54, 7% were ages 55­64 years, and 1% was 65 and older.
The death rate in 2004­2005 for males was higher than for
females, with the highest rate (5.8) for males at age 41 and
the highest rate for females (3.9) at age 43.21
The National Poison Data System of the American As-
sociation of Poison Control Centers reports the outcomes
of calls concerning human exposure to buprenorphine or
methadone. Table 1 shows that the number of methadone
exposures known to have resulted in a death increased from
26 in 2000 to 103 in 2008, while the number of known
buprenorphine deaths increased from 0 in 2000 to 2 in
2008. It should be noted that the deaths reported by the
poison centers are only a small portion of all the deaths, as

the centers only report deaths that were followed up after a
call to the center. Hence, if the center does not get a call, it
will not know about a death.

friend, 2% bought on the street, and 0.5% stolen. Of the
formulations involved in the deaths, 72% were unknown,
24% were tablets, 3% were liquid, and 0.5% were diskettes.
The exposure reasons were unknown for 57% of the deaths,
with abuse/misuse as the reason in 32%, suicide as the
motive in 10%, and therapeutic error as the reason in 2%
of the deaths.22 Table 2 shows the combinations of drugs
involved with methadone as reported by the poison centers.
Of the 2007 Texas deaths with a mention of methadone,
34% were female, 73% were White, 5% were Black, and
22% were Hispanic. Average age was 39 years, with 7%
being age 19 and younger, 21% in their twenties, 18% in the
thirties, 30% in their forties, and 25% age 50 and older. The
2007 methadone deaths reported by Texas poison control
centers and those 2005 poisoning deaths with methadone
as reported by NCHS were older than those reported by
RADARS®.
The number of overdose deaths of clients in Texas nar-
cotic treatment programs has remained fairly level over
time (Fig. 4), although the proportion of these overdose
deaths has decreased from 20% of all methadone deaths
in 2000 to 6% in 2007.23 In most cases, the toxicological
findings on these methadone treatment clients did not in-
dicate if the methadone serum concentrations were within
the therapeutic range.
The combinations of drugs being used with methadone
are changing. The proportion of Texas deaths involving
combinations with prescription or licit drugs (which may or
may not have been prescribed for the individual) increased

from 17% in 1992 to 46% in 2007, while combinations in-
volving illicit drugs such as cocaine decreased from 25% to
15%.
TOXICOLOGY FINDINGS
The National Forensic Laboratory Information System
(NFLIS), sponsored by the Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration (DEA), is a program that collects results from tox-
icological analyses conducted by state and local forensic
laboratories on substances seized in law enforcement oper-
ations. As of September 2008, 47 state forensic laboratory
systems and 94 local or municipal forensic laboratories rep-
resenting a total of 259 individual labs, were participating
in NFLIS. Delaware, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and
Vermont did not report to NFLIS in 2008.
NFLIS is an important indicator of the availability of
different drugs on the street as measured by the proportion
of items examined (Fig. 5). In 2000, of the 667,501 items
examined, 503 were methadone. In 2008, of the 1,393,621
items examined, 7,525 were methadone. There were 15
buprenorphine items examined in 2000 as compared to
4,034 in 2008.24
NFLIS shows different geographic patterns of drugs
identified by census region (Table 6). As with the other
indicators, buprenorphine was more often identified in the
northeast, while methadone was more often identified in
the south. It should be noted that the rates for the north-
east may be even higher since three of the four states that
did not report to NFLIS are in that region.
DISTRIBUTION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
DEA's Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders
System (ARCOS) reports sales of prescription drugs, and it
provides evidence of the increases in sales of methadone and
buprenorphine. Since 2000, the distribution of methadone

reflects the increased use of 5 and 10 mg methadone tablets
for analgesia (Fig. 6). In 2008, for the first time, more grams
of the 5 mg and 10 mg tablets were distributed than liquid
methadone and the drop in 40 mg units reflects the lim-
itation on their distribution as of January 2008. In 2008,
90% of the 5 and 10 mg tablets were purchased by phar-
macies and 97% of the liquid methadone was purchased by
narcotic treatment programs.25
The increase in the use of buprenorphine since its ap-
proval for use in the treatment of opioid dependence is
shown in Figure 7. ARCOS is the one source that provides
information about the use of buprenorphine as distributed
to both narcotic treatment programs and private physicians
prescribing the drug for narcotic treatment or treatment of
pain. Ninety-four percent of the Suboxone® and Subutex®
tablets were distributed through pharmacies; only 1% was
distributed to narcotic treatment programs in 2008.
More doses of methadone and buprenorphine were sold
in the northeast census region with the lowest amounts in
the midwest (Table 6).
DISCUSSION
This paper has reviewed publicly available data relating
to use, abuse, misuse, and distribution of methadone and
buprenorphine. These individual data sets are constrained
by significant limitations. Data are neither available on
buprenorphine admissions to treatment nor on deaths in-
volving the drug. Information is inconsistent on formula-
tion of the drugs used, sources of the drugs, age groups of
users, available years of data (2006 vs. 2008), whether the
drugs were prescribed for the individual, and the frequency
of combinations of these two drugs with other drugs. Yet,
when these pieces of information are drawn together, a
clearer picture emerges.
Between 2000 and 2008, the number of methadone
tablets (5, 10, and 40 mg) sold through retail outlets in-
creased from 110,670,209 to 728,344,627, the number of
human exposure calls to poison control centers increased
from 1,387 to 4,765, the number of methadone items iden-
tified by NFLIS laboratories increased from 503 to 7,525,
and grams of methadone shipped as reported to ARCOS
increased from 1,826 to 5,283. The number of methadone
cases seen in DAWN emergency rooms increased from
48,864 to 69,506 between 2004 and 2007, and the number
of deaths in NCHS with a mention of methadone increased
from 786 to 5,416 between 1999 and 2006.
The proportional increases in buprenorphine indicators
are much larger, but this is due to the fact the nonin-
jectable formulation did not come to market until 2002. Be-
tween 2000 and 2008, the number of poison control center
human exposure calls increased from 13 to 2,607, and be-
tween 2004 and 2008, the number of Suboxone® tablets sold
at the retail level increased from 7,707,099 to 106,537,708,
and the number of Subutex® tablets increased from
1,397,294 to 10,119,599. The number of NFLIS items iden-
tified as buprenorphine increased from 15 to 4,034 between
2000 and 2008 and the number of buprenorphine dosage
units reported by ARCOS increased from 1,210 to 44,698
between 2003 and 2008. The number of DAWN ED cases
increased from 1,001 to 10,229 between 2004 and 2007.
These increases are indications of the exposures to and di-
version of the drug since 70% of the DAWN cases were
reported to be related to nonmedical use of the drug.
Depending on the data source, anywhere from 38%
to 55% of the poison control center and DAWN ED
methadone cases involved only methadone, as did 31­33%
of the deaths involving methadone. However, these data
indicate that the majority of these adverse events and
deaths involved methadone in combination with other
drugs. According to the Texas death data, combinations of
methadone involving only illicit drugs are decreasing, while
combinations involving prescription opioids (whether pre-
scribed or not), are increasing.
The use of methadone for pain, as compared to treat-
ment for opioid dependence, can be tracked through data
reporting the formulation of the drug. According to the
2008 ARCOS data, distribution of the 5 mg and 10 mg
methadone tablets has now surpassed distribution of the
liquid used in narcotic treatment programs and Texas poi-
son control center statistics confirm the increases in calls
82 Buprenorphine and Methadone Use and Abuse January­February 2010
involving the tablets. Further, RADARS® data reported
that formulation of methadone was unknown for 72% of
deaths, but 24% of deaths could be attributed to methadone
tablets and 3% of deaths were traced to methadone liq-
uid. These data, when considered with the ARCOS data
and Texas data, appear to point to the increasing role of
methadone tablets used in the treatment of pain as a more
prevalent source of methadone toxicity than methadone
from narcotic treatment programs where the drug is dosed
in a liquid form.
The data showed the methadone user was more likely to
be male (depending on the dataset, between 53% and 67%),
White (74% and 77%), with the highest prevalence of use
among those of ages 21­24, according to NSDUH, DAWN,
and NCHS. However, their use of methadone continued
over the years with adverse events noted in Texas poison
center calls at an average age of 36, the highest death rates
in NCHS being 41 years for males and 43 years for females,
and DAWN ED visits continuing at high levels through
ages 45­54.
Buprenorphine numbers are scarcer due to ICD-10 cod-
ing. However, the rapid increases in buprenorphine as doc-
umented in the number of prescriptions written, poison
center exposures, DAWN, NFLIS, and ARCOS provide
evidence of the need to monitor the potential abuse of this
drug. Buprenorphine cases are less likely to occur among
males (47­53% females) and less likely to occur in persons
of color (87% White in DAWN). The age group seen most
often in DAWN data was 21­24 years and the average age
for the Texas poison center calls was 35 years.
Buprenorphine is also a more difficult drug to track,
since it can be prescribed for pain, for opioid treatment by
office-based practitioners, as well as for use in opioid treat-
ment programs. Thus, there is no reliable way to determine
the level of buprenorphine distributed for pain as com-
pared to office-based narcotic treatment, although ARCOS
reported that only 1% of the buprenorphine tablets were
distributed to narcotic treatment programs.
As of 2008, there is even less data on Subutex® in com-
parison to Suboxone®. Because of the small numbers of
Subutex® cases, DAWN suppression rules limited analysis
of the data and the numbers of different combinations could
not be determined. The data do not tell us if Subutex® users
differ in terms of sociodemographic characteristics. How-
ever, the increases in the number of Subutex® prescriptions
should be recognized. The buprenorphine/naloxone com-
bination tablet is recommended for use in the treatment of
opioid addiction,26 with limited use for Subutex®, which is
reserved for pregnant, opioid-dependent women. However,
methadone is still considered the standard of care for the
treatment of these women27 and the limited use for preg-
nant women seems unlikely to be the source of the large
increase in Subutex® prescriptions. One possibility is that
physicians are prescribing this formulation for the treat-
ment of opioid dependence when patients complain that
the combination tablet is not well-tolerated. Another possi-
bility is that physicians prescribe Subutex® for treatment of
pain (an indication that is not FDA-approved). The greater
abuse liability for the buprenorphine-alone formulation is
also confirmed by the data in this review and underscores
the need for physicians to carefully consider appropriate use
of buprenorphine-alone formulations, given the literature
on injection of Subutex®.28­30
Additional data are needed on reasons for use of these
two drugs. DAWN reported 7% of the methadone cases
were adverse reactions to the patient's own drugs and
16% of the buprenorphine cases also sought help for ad-
verse reactions. The RADARS® data reported 16% of the
methadone decedents took their own medications and ther-
apeutic error was the exposure reason in 2% of the deaths.
Determining the role of drugs taken by the patient as pre-
scribed, compared to using nonprescribed drugs or drugs
taken in a manner not prescribed, is a major concern. The
fact that the number of overdose deaths of clients in Texas
narcotic treatment programs remained stable while the total
number of methadone deaths in the state increased is evi-
dence that the problem with methadone-associated deaths
is not related to diversion of methadone from narcotic treat-
ment programs.
Analysis of the NFLIS, N-SSATS, and ARCOS data
found that availability of the two drugs differed by cen-
sus region, with more buprenorphine used in treatment,
distributed, and found in toxicology examinations in the
northeast. More methadone was examined in toxicology
laboratories in the south, with more methadone used in
treatment and distributed in the northeast. Because these
three datasets can be specific as to location (ARCOS and
N-SSATS are available at the zip code level), tracking "hot
spots" where levels of distribution and seizures are high,
but with no opioid treatment programs present to distribute
methadone or buprenorphine can be a way to identify areas
warranting additional attention by law enforcement and li-
censing boards for diversion or inappropriate prescribing.
Methadone and buprenorphine must also be considered
in the context of heroin and other opiates. Heroin indi-
cators including treatment admissions, DAWN ED visits,
and NCHS death data have remained fairly constant over
time while indicators for other opiates have increased. Since
1992, the gender and racial characteristics of the clients
having problems with illicit methadone have changed so
that by 2007, they more closely resembled other opiate
clients. All treatment clients, whether heroin-addicted, il-
licit methadone-addicted, or other opiates-addicted had
substantial rates of psychiatric illness (range: 25­37%)
(Table 4).
In addition, the secondary-problem drugs are different
in these groups. Some 31% of the individuals with a prob-
lem with other opiates reported no second problem, as did
29% of the heroin clients; but only 23% of those using illicit
methadone reported no other drug problem. And there was
variation in the secondary-problem drugs reported by those
who did have problems (Table 5). Given the demographic
Maxwell and McCance-Katz January­February 2010 83
similarities between the illicit methadone and other opiate
clients, the perceptions among users about illicit methadone
might be changing from use that had been primarily to
prevent withdrawal from heroin to now using methadone
to prevent withdrawal from other opiates. In brief, these
data raise the question of whether methadone is now con-
sidered as just "another opiate" by users. It appears that
two very different groups of opioid users (heroin vs. other
opiates + nonprescribed methadone) are emerging as treat-
ment seekers. Clinicians need to be aware of the different
treatment needs in terms of use with different drug combi-
nations, mental health treatment needs, and social support
networks or lack thereof.
Another issue of significant concern in these data is
the high rate of use of other drugs, both licit and il-
licit in combination with methadone and buprenorphine.
DAWN ED cases show significant increases in cases in-
volving methadone and other pharmaceuticals as well as
methadone in combination with alcohol, other illicit drugs,
and other pharmaceuticals (Table 3). Similarly, a myr-
iad of other drugs in combination with methadone and
with buprenorphine have been reported in data collected
through RADARS®, NCHS, Texas deaths, DAWN ED,
and the Texas poison centers (Table 2).
Consistently, co-occurring use of benzodiazepines, par-
ticularly alprazolam, has been reported in both methadone
and buprenorphine DAWN ED, poison center, and death
mentions (Table 2). These findings might be expected, given
recent findings from the NSDUH, which show a signif-
icant increase (p = .05) in misuse of tranquilizers from
2002 to 2006.31 Further, the most commonly misused tran-
quilizers among lifetime nonmedical users were Valium®
(diazepam), Xanax®
(alprazolam), Ativan®
(lorazepam),
and Klonopin®
(clonazepam), in that order.32 The rate of
benzodiazepine use in the population of methadone- and
buprenorphine-treated patients is high. Lifetime use of ben-
zodiazepines in methadone-maintained patients has been
reported to be as high as 94%.33 In addition, Iguchi and
colleagues reported that diazepam, lorazepam, and alpra-
zolam were frequently used by methadone clients for their
"high" producing effects and for selling to produce income.
They also reported that, in contrast, chlordiazepoxide and
oxazepam had much lower ratings of "high" and were less
likely to be obtained for getting "high" or for resale.33 Sim-
ilar findings for buprenorphine with benzodiazepines have
also been reported.34­36
Not all methadone- and buprenorphine-treated individ-
uals seek benzodiazepines with the intent to abuse these
drugs. Many of these patients experience significant anx-
iety, insomnia, and withdrawal symptoms that lead to re-
quests for ancillary medications;37,38 benzodiazepines are
often the drugs prescribed for these symptoms. One of the
clinical dilemmas in treating such patients is the differ-
entiation of true psychiatric disorders from drug-seeking
behavior. However, with exceptions to be discussed below,
a sound clinical approach to psychiatric complaints in this
population is to monitor for a period of time rather than
prescribing immediately; select nonbenzodiazepine inter-
ventions whenever possible (e.g., cognitive-behavioral ther-
apy); and, if necessary, utilize certain of the selective sero-
tonin reuptake inhibitors (below) for anxiety and depressive
symptoms; address other co-occurring drug and alcohol
abuse that may be contributing to the symptoms presented;
and provide education on sleep hygiene.
Close monitoring of the use of benzodiazepines and use
of long-acting medications such as clonazepam are pre-
ferred and must be undertaken if they are to be prescribed.
These medications should be prescribed for a short (e.g.,
2­4 months) period to prevent development of tolerance
and dependence.39 Further, frequent re-assessment to de-
termine positive benefit (e.g., increase in level of function)
should be documented. If improvement does not occur, it
should lead the clinician to question the benefit of the ben-
zodiazepine treatment, given the risks that are apparent
from the data in this paper.
Aside from misuse/abuse/overuse of these drugs with
methadone and buprenorphine that can lead to toxicity,
there are other important pharmacological reasons to ex-
pect that benzodiazepines in combination with opioids
might produce adverse events and even deaths. Benzodi-
azepines, like opioids, depress the central nervous system,
albeit via different pharmacological mechanisms. One of
many effects of the binding of an opioid agonist to the mu
opioid receptor is sedation and altered mental status.40 Ben-
zodiazepines produce similar effects, but via binding to the
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptor, producing
increased chloride ion flow into the neuron and resulting in
decreased membrane excitability.41 A combined pharmaco-
dynamic effect of these drugs can be to depress the central
nervous system to the point of toxicity. Indeed, what lit-
tle information exists on pharmacokinetic interactions be-
tween methadone and benzodiazepines indicates little in the
way of significant interactions.42 Pharmacokinetics studies
between buprenorphine and benzodiazepines have not been
reported to date, despite several reports of buprenorphine
toxicity in humans co-abusing these drugs.43,44 The paucity
of studies available in this area of research underscores the
need for it to be undertaken.
Another area of concern identified from the data in
this paper is the toxicity data related to methadone and
buprenorphine in combination with licit medications likely
prescribed for medical and psychiatric conditions. Of great-
est concern is the consistent reporting of adverse events
and deaths across data sets (Table 2), in which methadone
or buprenorphine occur in combination with psychotrop-
ics such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (in
particular, fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline,
citalopram, and escitalopram). While these drugs are not
known to produce mood-altering effects (e.g., "high," se-
dation), they share a common property of inhibition of
cytochrome (CYP)P450 2D6,45 an enzyme that plays a
role in methadone metabolism.46,47 Further, norfluoxetine,
84 Buprenorphine and Methadone Use and Abuse January­February 2010
a metabolite of fluoxetine, and fluvoxamine potently in-
hibit CYP P450 3A4, which is important to the metabolism
of methadone and buprenorphine. CYP 450 2C19 is also
important to the metabolism of buprenorphine and its
function is inhibited by fluoxetine and fluvoxamine.48 In-
hibition of the metabolism of long-acting opioids such as
methadone and buprenorphine could lead to toxicity, which
appears to be the case based on the data in this study. Clin-
icians need to be aware of the potential for such toxicities
and judiciously prescribe these medications.
If an SSRI must be used in methadone-maintained pa-
tients, selecting those that do not affect both CYP 450 2D6
and 3A4 would be preferable (choices would include parox-
etine, sertraline, and citalopram, escitalopram). If there is
a clinical need for use of these medications in methadone-
maintained patients, monitoring should be considered to
include a baseline cardiogram with a repeated cardiogram
after 2 weeks at a stable dose of antidepressant medica-
tion in order to follow the cardiac QT interval that can
increase should methadone metabolism be inhibited, lead-
ing to greater exposure.49 Patients receiving these medica-
tions should also be monitored for any increased opioid
effects that they may be experiencing. Evidence of toxic-
ity should trigger re-evaluation and alteration of the treat-
ment plan. Another consideration is the use of buprenor-
phine in patients needing an opioid therapy, but who
would also benefit from an SSRI treatment of a mental
disorder due to its ceiling effect at which increasing ex-
posure is not associated with increasing opioid effects.50
Further, buprenorphine metabolism is less likely to be af-
fected by SSRIs that primarily effect CYP 450 2D6, but
not CYP 450 3A4 (e.g., paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram,
escitalopram).51
Othermedicationsmentionedasbeingpresent incasesof
toxicity or deaths related to methadone or buprenorphine
use and that inhibit the function of CYP 2D6 include dulox-
etine, clomipramine, doxepin, perphenazine, and hydrox-
yzine. These medications are commonly used for treatment
of psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety as
well as psychosis (perphenazine). Amitriptyline, frequently
used for the treatment of depression as well as chronic pain,
is mentioned in RADARS® data for methadone. This medi-
cation is not only itself sedating with potential for pharma-
codynamic interactions with methadone and, potentially,
buprenorphine, but it is an inhibitor of both CYP 450 3A4
and 2D6.52 Similarly, atypical antipsychotics, specifically
quetiapine, olanzapine, and risperidone are mentioned in
association with methadone and buprenorphine use. Que-
tiapine has been reported to be abused by injection and
nasal insufflation, particularly with cocaine in a combina-
tion referred to as a "Q-ball."53 It is an inhibitor of CYP
450 2D6 and is an inhibitor of the efflux transporter p-
glycoprotein.54 Quetiapine should not be considered a first-
line treatment of anxiety or psychosis in methadone or
buprenorphine-maintained patients. Interestingly, risperi-
done and olanzepine do not inhibit metabolic enzymes re-
lated to methadone or buprenorphine metabolism, but have
been cited in toxicity reports.55,56
It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the po-
tential interactions of every drug mentioned in these ad-
verse events related to methadone and buprenorphine use.
However, it is useful for clinicians to be aware of the wide
variety of substances that may be associated with toxici-
ties in patients treated with these opioid therapies or who
are abusing these medications. What are the implications?
Do these data indicate that physicians should avoid the use
of many psychotropic and analgesic drugs in patients with
opioid dependence? We would suggest that this paper only
provides information that a clinician can use in consider-
ing treatment plans. When possible, clinicians might want
to avoid medications known to have the potential to pro-
duce pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions
in patients. Another possible consideration is to undertake
a genetic test to determine the level of activity of a patient's
CYP2D6 enzyme, since there are well-documented genetic
polymorphisms in this enzyme that include both rapid and
poor metabolism of drugs.57
Clinicians should become accustomed to considering the
possibility of drug interactions with medications they pre-
scribe. These data underscore the need to educate patients
about the potential for adverse drug interactions when these
medications are used together--or when they are misused
or abused together. Patients should ideally be receiving
medications from one prescriber; when this is not possible,
it is imperative that prescribing clinicians work together to
avoid such toxicities. Patients must be educated about the
need not to share medications and to use medications only
as prescribed. Further, they must be told about possible side
effects that should be reported to the treatment provider so
that rapid intervention(s) can be made if needed. Patient
treatment agreements outlining these parameters of treat-
ment may be useful in this population.
This confusing picture underscores the need for signif-
icant improvement of the indicators, particularly as new
abuse-resistant opioid drugs come to market. New drugs
are being introduced, but they are placed in ICD-10 codes
such as Other Synthetic Narcotics, which are nonspecific.
However, since 2003, the narrative text on the death cer-
tificate (referred to as "death certificate literals") has been
retained by NCHS for analysis and work is underway to
translate details on the death certificates into data that can
expand the nonspecific ICD-10 code categories. In addi-
tion, some states with centralized medical examiner sys-
tems, such as New Mexico,58 Florida,59 and Utah,60 have
information on the specific drugs and formulations, but
they cannot be used to provide national information, since
drugs and drug use patterns, particularly use of the opi-
oids, vary across the states. The 2007 SAMHSA Methadone
Mortality Meeting recommended that uniform nomencla-
ture, case definitions, and standards for toxicological test-
ing be used to encourage uniform reporting by medical
examiners and coroners and to support analysis.61 This
Maxwell and McCance-Katz January­February 2010 85
recommendation for standardization was expanded to in-
clude all the drug-related deaths in a SAMHSA Expert
Panel meeting in August, 2009.
Improvement in the collection and reporting of indicator
data is needed if FDA and the manufacturers are to meet
the requirements of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
Strategies (REMS).62 The key elements of the REMS will
be education and certification for prescribers, pharmacists,
other healthcare providers, or institutions that dispense or
directly administer covered opioid products, as well as pa-
tient education. The REMS will also use metrics to assess
the success of the REMS program in decreasing abuse and
misuse of opioids while ensuring they remain available for
patients who suffer daily from chronic pain. The available
data systems discussed in this paper need to be fully sup-
ported and the data reported by manufacturers to FDA
under REMS must be freely available to researchers and
public health officials who must monitor the effects in their
areas.
While improvements to data collection systems are es-
sential to improving public health related to prescription
opioid abuse, the data collected and presented in this paper
make several important points. First, they underscore the
rapid increases in prescribing of methadone and buprenor-
phine, the substantial and sobering statistics showing large
increases in toxicities and deaths related to misuse of
these drugs, and the increases in narcotic trafficking with
these medications. Second, the toxicities reported with these
drugs in combination with other drugs, particularly other
licit medications, underline the lack of understanding or
consideration by physicians of the possible toxic effects re-
lated to drug interactions. While only a few of these data
show which toxicities occurred in those prescribed these
medications versus those who illicitly obtained and abused
these drugs, it is still incumbent on physicians to be aware
of potential toxicities and to educate their patients regard-
ing these issues. The data in this manuscript may help to
assist with that process.
