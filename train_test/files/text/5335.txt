Abstract
Objective: This study aimed to describe treatment of serious complications after primary
thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in type B aortic dissection.
Methods: From June 2008 to March 2016, serious complications occurred in 58 patients without
Marfan syndrome who received TEVAR for type B aortic dissection.
Results: Complications included endoleak, distal true lumen collapse, retrograde dissection,
stroke, stent­graft (SG) migration and mistaken deployment, lower limb ischaemia, and SG
fracture. Treatment included endovascular repair, surgical procedures, or conservative medication.
Forty-six patients recovered from complications. Twelve patients were not cured. The median
follow-up time was 29.5 months (2­61 months). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 1.7% (1/58)
and the total mortality rate following secondary complications was 8.6% (5/58). The causes of
death were stroke and aortic rupture.
Conclusion: Some treatments need to be performed after TEVAR because of severe
complications. A reduction in these complications can be achieved by optimal evaluation of
patients, selection of SGs, and specialized endovascular manipulation.

Introduction
Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) is still one
of the most catastrophic vascular events
with a mortality rate of up to 80% if left
untreated.1,2 Conventional open surgical
aortic replacement used to be the only
effective treatment for type B aortic dissec-
tions, but it results in high mortality and
paraplegia.3
Within the last 10 years, minimally
invasive thoracic endovascular repair
(TEVAR) of type B TAD has become an
attractive alternative to conventional open
surgery. Thoracotomy, extracorporeal cir-
culation, aortic cross-clamping, high-dose
anticoagulation, and single lung ventilation
can be avoided. Several studies have shown
that the mortality rate following EVAR for
type B TAD is acceptably low at 1.5% to
8%.4­6 However, despite short- and mid-
term promising clinical results of this new
therapy, the long-term durability of EVAR
has not been established. Similar to
all conventional surgical methods, EVAR
for type B TAD is associated with
complications.

Method
Patient cohort
From June 2008 to March 2016, our depart-
ment admitted 58 patients without Marfan
syndrome who had undergone a thoracic
endovascular stent­graft (SG) procedure for
acute or chronic type B TAD and developed
serious complications.
There were 40 men and 18 women with a
mean age of 57.3 years (range, 28­85 years).
Twenty-seven patients underwent emer-
gency TEVAR (after onset < 72 hours) for
acute TAD, 16 patients received selected
TEVAR (after onset > 2 weeks) for acute
TAD, and eight patients underwent TEVAR
72 hours to 2 weeks after onset.
Endovascular procedures were performed
in seven patients with chronic asymptomatic
dissection. Thirty-nine patients developed
symptomatic complications postoperation
(mean time: 3.8 months, range 0­36
months). Nineteen asymptomatic complica-
tions were detected at the follow-up after
a SG was deployed (mean postoperative
time: 5.6 months, range 3­24 months).
The patients' complications are listed in

Investigation and imaging studies
Computed tomography (CT)-angiography of
the entire aorta with three-dimensional recon-
struction was performed in all of the patients
to investigate complications after the endo-
vascular procedure. Several variables were
carefully determined on contrast-enhanced
CT images and angiographic images. These
included the location and shape of a previ-
ously planted SG, the true lumen, the false
lumen, extension, the entry and re-entry sites,
and the relationship between the dissection
membrane and major aortic branches.
Stent­graft device and grafts
Four types of SG were used in this series,
including the Talent and Captivia
(Medtronic, USA), TX-1/TX-2 (Cook,
USA), and Hercules (Microport, China)
straight tube devices. One bare stent, Sinus
(OptiMed, Germany), was also used. All of
the SGs were available in different lengths
and sizes. The bare stents were also sized by
individual diameters. PTFE grafts (Gore,
USA) were used for surgical bypass.
Classification of complications and
treatment
1. Endoleak
Endoleaks were detected in 16 patients,
including 12 type 1 endoleaks and four type
2 endoleaks from the left subclavian artery
(LSA). We treated five patients with type 1
endoleak with additional SGs proximal to
the original SG, and we treated three
patients by ballooning the original SG. All
of the endoleaks disappeared postopera-
tively. Four type 1 patients were treated by
conservative medical treatment with no
enlargement of the false lumen. Four
type 2 leaks from the LSA were sealed by
coil embolization.
2. Distal true lumen collapse
Sixteen patients had distal true lumen
collapse following deployment of SGs. Four
of them developed a secondary rupture and
haemothorax. All of the patients were treated
with two additional SGs or one SG with one
bare stent. First, we implanted a smaller bare
stent or SG extension in the distal aorta. A
large SG was then placed in the proximal
aorta to block the intimal tear and attach the
previous SG and distal stent (Figure 1).
3. Retrograde dissection
Six retrograde type A dissections were
found. One patient had serious chest pain
and underwent surgical intervention by
ascending aorta replacement. Five patients
received conservative medical treatment and
were provided follow-up care after discharge
because of advanced age and a poor physical
condition.
4. Paraplegia/paraparesis
Only one patient with complete paralysis
had undergone an aortic arch replacement
surgery before EVAR (Figure 2). We treated
this condition with thrombolytic therapy
using urokinase and anticoagulation ther-
apy with low-molecular-weight heparin.
5. Stroke
Six patients suffered strokes. Primary
strokes occurred in all of the patients
because of forward pushing of the SG that
led to covering of the left carotid artery.
Four patients underwent emergency surgical
bypass operations (Figure 3). The other two
patients who were transferred from another
hospital 2 months after the endovascular
procedure only received conservative med-
ical treatment because of a lack of time for
emergency surgery.
SG migration and mistaken deployment
1576 Journal of International Medical Research 45(5)
Four misaligned deployments of the SG
occurred, and angiography showed that the
proximal bare stents were bent outward and
folded over the SG (Figure 4). One patient
underwent an open surgical operation invol-
ving aortic replacement, and the other three
were maintained in follow-up.
We also experienced two cases involving
incorrect recognition of the true lumen, in
which SGs were directly placed into the false
lumen. These two patients were treated by
deploying several long SGs into the aorta
such that the proximal lumen and the distal
true lumen were connected by the SGs
through the false lumen (Figure 5).
6. Lower limb ischaemia
Five patients developed lower limb
ischaemia after the procedure. Two of
them underwent surgical thrombectomy
and artery angioplasty. An emergency

true lumen collapse was observed. (c) This collapse was treated using two SG implants. First, a smaller SG
fitting the distal lumen was deployed to prevent true lumen collapse, and then a large SG fitted to the previous
SG was implanted.

femoral­femoral artery bypass was per-
formed in one patient. Delayed lower limb
ischaemia occurred in the other two
patients. We performed a femoral­femoral
bypass in one patient and a stent implant
following balloon dilatation in the other
patient.
7. Stent­graft fracture
An SG fracture occurred in two patients.
Thesepatientsdevelopedacutechestpainafter
the SG implant for several years. CT showed
that the SG fractured and the false lumen
expanded. We deployed new SGs to repair the
broken SG and false lumen (Figure 6).
Follow-up investigation
The median follow-up time was 29.5 months
(range: 2­45 months). Physical examin-
ations and enhanced CT post-discharge
were performed at 6 months, 12 months,
and annually thereafter.
Results
Endovascular, open surgical, or medical
management were performed in the patients.
All of the secondary operations succeeded.
Forty-six (46/58, 79.3%) patients recovered
and 12 (12/58, 20.7%) remained unhealed.
The overall 30-day mortality was 1.7%
(1/58) for patients undergoing management.
Four patients died during follow-up.
The survival rate in our group was 91.4%
(53/58).
Nine of the 12 type 1 endoleaks were
closed by secondary endovascular proced-
ures or conservative medical treatment.
Three of the type 1 endoleaks were still
present with no evidence of aortic enlarge-
ment. One patient with a type 1 endoleak
died during follow-up because of aortic
rupture resulting from poor blood pressure
control. All type 2 endoleaks were closed by
coils or occluders.
All of the patients with distal true lumen
collapse (16/16) received endovascular man-
agement. All of the newly developed distal
dissection disappeared and no new compli-
cations occurred during follow-up
(Figure 1).
One of the six patients with retrograde
type A dissection who underwent surgical
intervention by ascending aorta replacement
survived. Five patients with conservative
medical treatment survived, but two
showed obvious aortic enlargement, and
ultimately died because of aortic rupture.
The other three patients died of other causes
that did not appear to be related to retro-
grade type A dissection.
The only patient with paraplegia
remained unhealed. Four of the six patients
with stroke underwent emergency surgical
bypass operations, and three of them recov-
ered with slight sequelae (Figure 3). One
patient died 1 week after the operation. The
other two patients with stroke remained
unhealed with no obvious change.
One of the four patients with SG migra-
tion recovered after surgical intervention by
ascending aorta replacement. Two patients
recovered after endovascular repair by an
additional covered SG proximal to the

original SG. One patient was treated by
conservative medical treatment with no
enlargement of the false lumen. One of two
patients with mistaken deployment died
because of severe SG migration and aortic
rupture 30 months after secondary EVAR
(Figure 5). Another patient who received a
conventional operation was still alive at
follow-up.
All of the patients with lower limb ischae-
mia recovered after surgical intervention
and appeared to be in good health. All of
the patients with SG fracture recovered after
deploying new SGs to repair the broken SG
and false lumen.
Discussion
The first endovascular repairs of type B
aortic dissection were reported in 1999 by
Dake et al.7 and Nienaber et al.8 Since this
time, many clinical reports have shown that
endovascular repair is technically feasible
and has a significantly lower rate of

complications compared with conventional
surgical repair.9,10,11 Despite the reasonably
low early operative morbidity and mortality,
later serious complications related to EVAR
(e.g., development of aneurysms, aortic
rupture, stroke, paraplegia, limb ischaemia,
access-related complications, and endo-
leaks) have been increasingly reported.4,5,10
Therefore, every surgeon should consider
methods for reducing the incidence of com-
plications of EVAR for type B dissection.
Detailed preoperative assessment of
patients should be carefully performed. In
addition to the general condition, observa-
tion and measurement of aortic dissection
images are required. Some items must be
determined, such as the true lumen, false
lumen, entry and re-entry sites, location and
extension of the lesion, diameter of the
aorta, tortuosity of the aorta, access arteries,
and the relationship between the dissection
membrane and major arterial branches. The
effects of EVAR treatment are closely
related to preoperative evaluation and selec-
tion of cases, configuration and type of SG,
as well as the clinical experience of the
surgeon.
Endovascular procedures are accompa-
nied by various types of risks, especially for
complex aortic lesions. The incidence of
complications is closely correlated with the
surgeon's skill and advanced endovascular
equipment.12 Therefore, EVAR treatment
should be carried out in highly specialized
vascular centres where the requirement can
be met to routinely perform open and
endovascular procedures. This would help
to cope with accidents in an effective and
timely manner.
The time of endovascular intervention for
aortic dissection is still controversial. We
believe that EVAR for dissection should not
proceed from 3 days to 3 weeks since the
onset because of oedema, weakness, and
poor flexibility and tensility of the aortic
walls. We found that severe complications
were more common if EVAR was carried
out within 3 weeks. Therefore, if there was
no organ or lower limb ischaemia, we still
insisted that EVAR should occur 3 weeks

after the dissection. To avoid risks, EVAR
should be performed in an emergency
(<72 hrs) or selectively (>3 weeks).
However, for considerable complications,
as some authors have indicated,2,13,14 we
also believe that asymptomatic chronic
patients may benefit more from conservative
treatment than from EVAR.
With continuous improvements of SGs
and development of endovascular tech-
niques, indications of EVAR for aortic
dissections are also expanding. However,
because of limits of the SG structure, indi-
cations for intervention should be strictly
selected to improve the efficacy. There are
some relative contraindications to EVAR
for aortic dissection. In particular, EVAR
should be contraindicated when the anat-
omy of dissection prevents a safe and effect-
ive performance of the SG that often
remarkably increases the complication
rates. EVAR in patients with an aortic size
outside the range of available SG devices
should be avoided. Severe tortuosity of the
aorta or the access vessels and advanced
aortoiliac occlusive disease preclude the
safety of EVAR. EVAR should also be
avoided in patients with a poor general
condition, those with no tolerance of the
procedures, and those with serious disorders
with an expected survival < 2 years.
Endoleak is the most common complica-
tion of endovascular treatment. The inci-
dence of EVAR for a thoracic aorta
is approximately 4% to 12%.2,13
Approximately half of the endoleaks may
close spontaneously. Short-term follow-up
in a previous study showed that there were
no significant survival differences between
patients with endoleaks closing and non-
closing endoleaks.6 However, long-term
endoleaks, especially type I endoleaks, may
cause an intimal tear to continuously open,
and blood flow may persist in the false
lumen, thus affecting the long-term effects.
The main reasons for this situation include a
tortuous aorta that may cause the SG to not
completely attach to the aortic wall or SG
bending, an anchor zone that is too short, an
SG that is too small or too large, and a
fragile proximal aorta. Careful preoperative
evaluation and selection of the appropriate
SG configuration should be carried out to
increase the proximal and distal landing
zones to prevent the occurrence of endo-
leaks. If endoleak occurs, balloon dilatation
and SG expansion may help to close the
endoleak. Small, stable endoleaks can be
treated by medication and observation if
there is no false lumen growth.15
Neurological complications can be devas-
tating after EVAR for type B dissections.
Stroke occurs at similar rates between open
and endovascular repairs.10 Deployment of
the proximal end of the SG proximal to the
left carotid artery can cause a fatal stoke.
Emergency revascularization has to be per-
formed as soon as possible for such patients
to survive. Moreover, perioperative stroke
may occur secondary to manipulation of the
arch with catheters, wires, balloons, and SG
devices at the origin of the cerebral vessels.
Proficiency of an endovascular technique is
important and can minimize the risks.
EVAR shows a marked reduction in
paraplegia/paraparesis compared with
open procedures.16 This may be related to
avoidance of thoracic clamping and reduced
haemodynamic disturbance at the spinal
cord level. However, there is a decrease in
cerebrospinal perfusion pressure when over-
stenting feeding intercostals.5 Surgeons
should exercise caution in patients with
previous open surgery of the thoracic or
abdominal aortas. Overstenting of too long
a segment of the total descending thoracic
aorta should be avoided. Spinal drainage
techniques and steroids can be used to
prevent these complications.
Even after successful placement of SGs in
type B dissection, the distal descending
thoracic aortic segment is still a problem.
In the presence of a larger distal SG size and
smaller distal true lumen dimension, the
Liu et al. 1581
descending thoracic aortic segment of the
false lumen shows no tendency to thrombose
and remodel completely. However, this can
lead to late distal true lumen collapse. An
extended bare stent or short SG scaffolding
of the dissection beyond the main SG and
down to the distal aorta results in repos-
itioning and fixation of the distal lamella.
This technique can be applied as an adjunct-
ive measure to primary SG insertion to
prevent distal true lumen collapse.17 This
method also has the capacity to repair such
complications in a secondary procedure. A
tapered SG adapted to variations in aortic
size could solve this problem. However,
because this requires customization of the
SG individually, it may not be applicable to
emergency procedures.
Retrograde type A dissection within hours
or even 1 month after EVAR is not a rare
complication and can be life-threatening,
especially when a type B tear has been over-
stented close to or opposite to the left
subclavian ostium.18 Fragility of the aortic
wall and progression of disease, combined
with SG-related causes, contribute to occur-
rence of retrograde type A dissection.
Improvement of the SG system, careful selec-
tion of SGs and patients, and specialized
endovascular manipulation may prevent such
complications. Surgical and medical treat-
ment can be effective management strategies.
Mistaken deployment can occur during
deployment of thoracic SGs because of a
high flow rate and severe aortic angulation,
which are often encountered in the thoracic
aorta. This mistake is an unusual phenom-
enon that tends to occur in the context of
certain well-defined anatomical conditions
in the thoracic aorta. To date, most of these
events have not led to major adverse
sequelae. However, careful selection of
patients, periprocedural imaging, and case
planning can help to identify anatomy in
which a misaligned opening is likely to
occur, allowing physicians to avoid this
complication.19
SG fractures are rare. They occur in
irregular homemade products. Products
must undergo formal government approval.
Strict laws regarding quality should be
made, with establishment of criteria for
quality inspection and setting up of a regu-
latory body to ensure that the criteria are
strictly adhered to.
With the EVAR technique being widely
performed, an increasing number of inex-
perienced operators have started to perform
endovascular repair for type B dissection. A
lack of assessment for lesions and an
inappropriate choice of SG could cause
severe consequences. These consequences
include SG migration and incorrect deploy-
ment, which are difficult to deal with.
Standard specialized treatment will reduce
the occurrence of such complications.
Therefore, every surgeon should undergo
standardized professional training before
starting EVAR for aortic diseases.
For lesions involving the aortic arch,
important arterial branches, and a short
anchor zone (so-called complex dissections),
use of a common configuration of SG often
leads to various types of severe complica-
tions. These complications include endo-
leak, organ ischaemia, unstable SG
implants, and SG migration. LSA over-
stenting can increase the anchor zone.
With preoperative evaluation of transcranial
crossflow facilities and the absence of car-
otid stenosis, it is well tolerated without
transposition of the LSA.6,10 According to
the range of dissections, a hybrid procedure
combines vessel debranching, and endovas-
cular repair can be chosen for complex
dissections. There have been no reports of
cerebral ischaemia after hybrid proced-
ures.20,21 The chimney technique uses a
covered or bare stent that is deployed par-
allel to the main aortic SG, which can
preserve flow to branches by the aortic SG.
Standard off-the-shelf SGs can be used to
instantly treat lesions with inadequate
anchor zones.22,23 However, this may also
1582 Journal of International Medical Research 45(5)
cause more endoleaks. Specially designed
fenestrated or branched SGs can seal the
complex dissection and reconstruct import-
ant arterial branches. However, currently,
this endovascular procedure is still under
clinical trial and cannot be widely
promoted.24,25
Conclusion
Although long-term data are still unavail-
able, the advantages of TEVAR over con-
ventional descending aortic surgery are
clear. TEVAR is minimally invasive, results
in less blood loss, requires a shorter oper-
ation time, is easier to operate, leads to
faster postoperative recovery, and results in
much shorter hospitalizations compared
with other techniques. TEVAR also reduces
the incidence of common postoperative
complications in organs, such as the heart,
lungs, and kidney. Older patients or those
with severe co-morbidities can be effectively
treated with this technique.
Currently, TEVAR is becoming the gold
standard for type B TAD. Despite the
favourability of TEVAR, notably, compli-
cations that are unique to endovascular
procedures may occur, and acute or delayed
complications may occur. A reduction in
these complications could be achieved by
optimal evaluation of patients, selection of
SGs, and specialized endovascular manipu-
lation. Further studies are still needed to
investigate life-long surveillance and long-
term clinical effects of TEVAR.
