Abstract
Objective: Intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is
considered the most effective treatment method for AIS; however, it is associated with a risk of
hemorrhage. We analyzed the risk factors for digestive and urologic hemorrhage during rt-PA
therapy.
Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients with AIS who underwent intravenous thromb-
olysis with rt-PA during a 5-year period in a Chinese stroke center. Data on the demographics,
medical history, laboratory test results, and clinical outcomes were collected.
Results: 338 patients with AIS were eligible and included. Logistic regression multivariate analysis
showed that gastric catheter was significantly correlated with digestive hemorrhage, while age and
urinary catheter were significantly correlated with urologic hemorrhage. Most hemorrhagic events
were associated with catheterization after 1 to 24 hours of rt-PA therapy.
Conclusions: In summary, gastric and urinary catheters were correlated with digestive and
urologic hemorrhage in patients with AIS undergoing rt-PA therapy. Well-designed controlled
studies with large samples are required to confirm our findings.

Introduction
Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) accounts for
about 80% of all types of stroke.1 The
estimated annual incidence of stroke is
0.25% and increases with aging.2 The clin-
ical syndrome of AIS involves a sudden
onset of focal or global disturbance of
central nervous system function caused by
an interruption in the cerebral circulation.
Therefore, the main therapeutic goals for
AIS are improvement of the circulation,
neuroprotection, and prevention of compli-
cations. In addition to endovascular ther-
apy, intravenous thrombolysis with
recombinant tissue plasminogen activator
(rt-PA) has been considered the most effect-
ive method against AIS,3 showing signifi-
cant improvement in the survival rate and
quality of life of patients with AIS.
However, intravenous thrombolysis with
rt-PA is associated with a risk of hemor-
rhage. Patients with serious hemorrhage
usually have a poor clinical prognosis with
a mortality rate of up to 90%.4 Most studies
to date have focused on cerebral hemor-
rhage as a complication of intravenous
thrombolysis. For instance, one study
showed that the presence of leukoaraiosis
might increase the risk of intracerebral
hemorrhage after intravenous thrombolysis
in patients with AIS.5 However, the events
associated with peripheral hemorrhage have
been rarely discussed despite the fact that
these events also affect the survival of
patients with AIS who undergo intravenous
thrombolysis with rt-PA.6 In the present
study, we analyzed the risk factors for
digestive and urologic hemorrhage with the
aim of enabling more patients with AIS to
gain benefits from rt-PA therapy.
Materials and methods
Study design
We retrospectively analyzed patients with
AIS who underwent intravenous
thrombolysis with rt-PA during a 5-year
period (April 2011­April 2016) in the most
well-known stroke center in China (Xuanwu
Hospital, Capital Medical University,
Beijing). Data on the patients' demograph-
ics, medical history, laboratory test results,
and clinical outcomes were collected.
For intravenous thrombolysis, rt-PA
(Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH,
Ingelheim, Germany) was administered at
dose of 0.9 mg/kg.
Patient selection
Eligible patients were required to meet the
following criteria: age of !18 years, onset
within 4.5 hours, !1-hour duration of clin-
ical signs related to stroke, no findings of
intracranial hemorrhage or early large-area
cerebral infarction on brain computed
tomography, and provision of informed
consent. The exclusion criteria were absence
of intact records during rt-PA therapy,
performance of arterial thrombolysis after
failure of intravenous thrombolysis, and
contraindications for rt-PA therapy.
Data collection
We used an electrocardiogram monitor
(IntelliVue MP70; Philips Healthcare,
USA) to collect the patients' vital signs.
The registered clinical data included sex,
age, vital signs, height, weight, body mass
index, thrombolysis time window, drug
administration, and history of hypertension,
diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, drink-
ing, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrilla-
tion, stroke, transient ischemic attack,
peptic ulcer, surgery, and trauma/falls.
Twenty-five laboratory parameters were
measured from routine blood, biochemical,
and coagulation tests, and brain computed
tomography scans were performed. All
patients were evaluated using the National
Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)
and activities of daily living (ADL) scale.

Study outcomes
Peripheral hemorrhage such as digestive and
urologic hemorrhage occurring within 36
hours of intravenous thrombolysis were the
main outcomes in the present study. The
diagnosis of digestive hemorrhage was
dependent on gastric juice and feces test
results, while the presence of positive red
blood cells on routine urinalysis was neces-
sary for a diagnosis of urologic hemorrhage.
Statistical analysis
We used EpiData 3.1 (EpiData, Odense,
Denmark) to set up the database with
double-personnel data entry and SPSS
v.18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) to
analyze the data. For all tests, differences
were considered statistically significant at a
p value of <0.05.
Ethical considerations
This study was approved by the ethics
committee of Capital Medical University.
Prior to entering the study, all patients were
informed of the study procedures.
Results
In total, 338 patients with AIS were eligible
and included in the study. Of these patients,

adverse events were related to catheteriza-
tion after 1 to 24 hours of rt-PA therapy.
The proportion was 75.0% (9 of 12 events)
among patients with digestive hemorrhage
and 58.3% (7 of 12 events) among patients
with urologic hemorrhage.
Discussion
At present, rt-PA is the most widely used
therapy for intravenous thrombolysis world-
wide.7 Most studies have mainly focused on
the development of cerebral hemorrhagic
events caused by rt-PA8; relatively little
is known about the risk factors for periph-
eral hemorrhage. One study focused on 1044
patients with AIS who underwent intraven-
ous thrombolysis with rt-PA and found that
hypertension at baseline was closely
correlated with hemorrhagic events.9
Blood pressure control (systolic blood
pressure < 185 mmHg, diastolic blood
pressure < 185 mmHg) has been confirmed
to be beneficial in preventing hemorrhagic
events after rt-PA therapy.10 The NIHSS
score is another important index for pre-
dicting hemorrhagic events after rt-PA ther-
apy. An NIHSS score of >25 is generally
thought to be a contraindication for rt-PA
therapy.11 Our analyses revealed the follow-
ing risk factors: the systolic blood pressure
at baseline, the NIHSS and ADL scores
before rt-PA therapy, and administration of
a single aspirin dose or aspirin combined
with clopidogrel within 24 hours after rt-PA
therapy. Various drugs such as cortisol,
aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs are known to potentially result in
stomach ulcers and bleeding.12
We identified the following risk factors
for urologic hemorrhage: age, the NIHSS
and ADL scores before rt-PA therapy, use
of low-molecular-weight heparin after rt-PA

and the prothrombin time activity.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is generally
believed to have satisfactory safety and a
low risk of bleeding.13 However, more
attention should be given to patients
undergoing rt-PA therapy, especially when
they have other risk factors such as high age.
No significant differences were found in sex,
although this can likely be attributed to the
small sample size. Male patients are usually
more vulnerable to hemorrhagic events.14
Potential selection bias could be another
reason. For instance, fewer older patients
underwent rt-PA therapy because of the
higher risk with age. The male:female ratio
was 2.6:1.0, which meant male-dominant
sample. Solutions to these problems might
include expansion of the sample size, inclu-
sion of multiple populations, and proper
randomization. The multivariate logistic
regression analysis showed that catheteriza-
tion was an independent risk factor for
patients with AIS undergoing rt-PA ther-
apy. Impairments during catheterization
might give rise to hemorrhagic events.
In summary, gastric and urinary cath-
eterization were respectively correlated with
digestive and urologic hemorrhage in
patients with AIS undergoing rt-PA ther-
apy. Well-designed controlled studies with
large samples are required to confirm our
findings. Classification of bleeding as minor,
moderate, and severe according to the
Global Use of Strategies To Open coronary
arteries (GUSTO) criteria should also be
considered.15
