Gender and Crime Victimization Modify Neighborhood
Effects on Adolescent Mental Health
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Adolescents living in lower-
poverty neighborhoods have better mental health than youth in
high-poverty contexts, but it is unclear if associations are causal.
Furthermore, it is unknown why some youth benefit more than
others from moving to more advantaged neighborhoods.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Using an experimental study that
randomly assigned families to receive vouchers to move to lower-
poverty neighborhoods, we found that recent violent crime
victimization adversely modified the mental health effects of
moving to better neighborhoods.
abstract
OBJECTIVE: Leverage an experimental study to determine whether
gender or recent crime victimization modify the mental health effects
of moving to low-poverty neighborhoods.
METHODS: The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) study randomized low-
income families in public housing to an intervention arm receiving
vouchers to subsidize rental housing in lower-poverty neighborhoods
or to controls receiving no voucher. We examined 3 outcomes 4 to 7
years after randomization, among youth aged 5 to 16 years at
baseline (n = 2829): lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD),
psychological distress (K6), and Behavior Problems Index (BPI).
Treatment effect modification by gender and family's baseline report
of recent violent crime victimization was tested via interactions in
covariate-adjusted intent-to-treat and instrumental variable adherence-
adjusted regression models.
RESULTS: Gender and crime victimization significantly modified treat-
ment effects on distress and BPI (P , .10). Female adolescents in
families without crime victimization benefited from MTO treatment,
for all outcomes (Distress B = ­0.19, P = .008; BPI B = ­0.13, P = .06;
MDD B = ­0.036, P = .03). Male adolescents in intervention families
experiencing crime victimization had worse distress (B = 0.24, P =
.004), more behavior problems (B = 0.30, P , .001), and nonsignif-
icantly higher MDD (B = 0.022, P = .16) versus controls. Other sub-
groups experienced no effect of MTO treatment. Instrumental
variable estimates were similar but larger.
CONCLUSIONS: Girls from families experiencing recent violent crime
victimization were significantly less likely to achieve mental health ben-
efits, and boys were harmed, by MTO, suggesting need for cross-
sectoral program supports to offset multiple stressors. Pediatrics

Adolescents living in disadvantaged con-
texts, including neighborhood poverty,
exhibit elevated emotional distress.1,2
This association is hypothesized to be
due to the higher prevalence of stressors
and fewer stress-buffering resources in
low-income neighborhoods.1 However,
the majority of neighborhood mental
health studies are observational and
therefore may be biased by unmeasured
confounding.3,4 Experimental designs
alleviate these serious internal validity
threats.5 Moving to Opportunity (MTO) is
the only study to date that has randomly
assigned individuals to move to differ-
ent neighborhood contexts, offering a
robust test of whether changes in
neighborhood and housing conditions
cause mental health.
Not all youth respond uniformly to sim-
ilar contexts.6 For example, previous
analyses of MTO showed mental health
benefits for girls but either nonsignifi-
cant or null effects for boys.7­9 These
findings highlight the potential for sub-
groups to experience substantially di-
vergent outcomes as a result of the
same intervention. One possible source
of heterogeneity is youth vulnerability.
Many interventions provide the greatest
benefit to individuals who are already
relatively advantaged, with respect to
health or social conditions. Children
understressbeforeaninterventionmay
not benefit to the same extent as more
advantaged children; fully capitalizing
on an intervention may require resour-
ces depleted in highly stressed or vul-
nerable youth.10,11 Highly stressed or
traumatized children may have diffi-
culty transitioning to new communi-
ties (eg, feeling alienated, unable to
establish social networks),12­14 so
relocating may be a more important
stressor for these children.15­17
One of the most powerful and com-
mon sources of stress for youth in low-
income neighborhoods is exposure to
violence,18,19 which is associated with
poorer mental health,20 school dropout,
teen pregnancy, criminal involvement,21
and fraternization with substance-using
peers.22 This suggests that youth
exposed to violent victimization may
be less able to benefit from moving
out of disadvantaged neighborhoods
because they are already at higher
risk for poor outcomes, and the stress
of violence exposure may be com-
pounded by the stress of assimilating
into a new neighborhood and social
network.12,13,15,17
Wehypothesizethatthementalhealthof
youth from families who have experi-
encedrecentviolentcrimevictimization
will not benefit from, and may even be
harmed by, moving out of high-poverty,
violent neighborhoods into better neigh-
borhoods through a housing mobility
intervention, unlike their counterparts
from nonvictimized families. We aim in
this study to (1) confirm previous dif-
ferential gender effects of MTO by using
improved measures of mental health
outcomes and (2) test our novel hy-
pothesis of effect modification by fa-
milial exposure to violent crime.
METHODS
The MTO for Fair Housing Demonstration
Project was a randomized controlled
trial sponsored by the US Department
of Housing and Urban Development23
in 5 sites (1994­1998): Boston, Baltimore,
Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York.
Eligible low-income families had children
aged ,18, qualified for rental assis-
tance, and lived in public housing or
project-based assisted housing in areas
with high concentrations of poverty.24
Applicants were drawn from waiting
lists, signed enrollment agreements
and informed consent, completed the
Baseline Survey, and were evaluated
for eligibility25 by public housing au-
thorities. Five thousand three hundred
one families volunteered, and 4610
families were eligible and random-
ized8 (Fig 1). MTO was not registered in
Consolidated Standards of Reporting
Trials (CONSORT) because it was not
a medical intervention.
Treatment Assignment
Special software randomly assigned
MTO families to 1 of 3 conditions. The
"regular Section 8" treatment group
was offered Section 8 housing vouch-
ers to subsidize a private market rental
apartment in any neighborhood. The
"low-poverty-neighborhood" treatment
group was also offered Section 8 housing
vouchers, but they were redeemable
only in low-poverty neighborhoods
(where ,10% of Census Tract house-
holds were impoverished). Families in
this group were offered housing coun-
seling services to aid relocation. The
third group was an untreated control
group, who received no additional as-
sistance but could remain in public
housing.25
Assessment
Surveys at baseline (1994­1998) and
the interim follow-up (2001­2002) were
conducted in person via computer-
assisted personal interviewing tech-
nology with household heads and their
children.8,25 Youth were interviewed in
teen centers to improve privacy.24 We
focus on adolescents (n = 3537 aged
12­19 as of May 31, 2001) randomized
through December 31, 1997 in the MTO
Tier 1 Restricted Access Data; the ef-
fective response was 89.3%.8 Adults
provided informed written consent for
themselves and their children.8,24,25
Northeastern University's Institutional
Review Board approved this study.
Measures
Past-month nonspecific psychological
distress was measured by the K6 scale,26
with 5-item Likert frequency response
options for 6 items: depressed; nervous;
restless or fidgety; hopeless; everything
was an effort; worthless. We scored the
K6 with 2-parameter binary item re-
sponse theory (IRT) methods to obtain
ARTICLE
PEDIATRICS Volume 130, Number 3, September 2012 473
distress factor scores with a standard
normal distribution.26 (Cronbach a =
.80, mean [SD] = ­0.0395 [1.123]). (Each
unit change in the IRT-scaled K6 cor-
responds to approximately an SD; re-
gression coefficients are interpreted
approximately as proportions of an SD
in effect size). IRT scoring is recom-
mended because items with stronger
relationships to the underlying dis-
tress construct are weighted heavier,
increasing reliability and precision
over simple summed scores.26,27
Behavior problems were measured by
11 self-reported items adapted from the
Behavior Problems Index (BPI)28 assess-
ing primarily externalizing behaviors.
Responses for items such as "I lie or
cheat" and "I have a hot temper" range
from 0 (not true) to 2 (often true). We
used 2-parameter binary IRT methods
to obtain BPI factor scores (a = .80,
mean [SD] = 20.0250 [1.086]).
Lifetime Diagnostic and Statistical Man-
ual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition
major depressive disorder (MDD) was
adapted from the National Comorbidity
Survey Replication­Adolescent Sup-
plement, implemented by trained lay
interviewers. This measure displays
good concordance with Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual diagnoses29; the
algorithm to derive lifetime MDD is in
SupplementalInformation1(mean[SD]=
0.0458 [0.2538]). Although temporal
ordering of treatment and lifetime
MDD is not established in these anal-
yses, given that this sample was
young at baseline (before typical age
of MDD onset30) and randomized to
treatment, we feel confident that group
differences in 2002 MDD can be at-
tributed to incident differences since
baseline.
Randomly assigned treatment of an
offer of a housing voucher (versus not)
was indicated with 1 binary variable:
treatment versus control group. Al-
though MTO contained 2 experimental
treatment groups, effects on mental
health were similar for both groups
(versus controls), and formal statis-
tical tests for each outcome could not
reject (P , .05) effect homogeneity.
We therefore combined experimental
groups to improve statistical power.
Results retaining the original 3 treat-
ment groups are presented in Supple-
mental Figs 3­5. (Mean neighborhood
poverty immediately after relocation
for low-poverty and Section 8 treat-
ment groups were 7.9% and 27.1%,
respectively, compared with baseline
control mean of 50.5%, indicating that
experimental movers did move to
substantially lower-poverty neighbor-
hoods; 1990 census data).
Treatment adherence was defined as
using the rental subsidy voucher of-
fered to lease an apartment within 90
days (after which the voucher offer
expired).7,8 By definition, the experi-
mental voucher was unavailable to the
control group so control subjects were
fully compliant. Approximately half of
families randomly assigned to the ex-
perimental treatment of a voucher of-
fer took up the offer and moved by
using the voucher.
Victimization was based on household
head report that a household member
had been victimized by violent crime
within 6 months before baseline.
Covariates
To improve efficiency, we adjusted for
site, gender, and other prerandomi-
zation characteristics enumerated in
Table 1. Covariate adjustment had little
effect on results.

giftedness, and schoolwork or behavior problems; household head marital status, employment, education, tenure in neighborhood, relationships with baseline neighbors, presence of family/
friends in baseline neighborhood, and previous application for Section 8. Missing baseline covariate data were imputed to site-specific means (,5 missing)8 or modeled with missing

Analytic Approach
We estimated additive effects of treat-
mentassignmentbyregressingoutcomes
(K6, BPI, and MDD) on randomly assigned
treatment group with covariate-adjusted
linear regression, per intent-to-treat
(ITT) principles.31 Covariate adjustment
was not necessary for internal validity
given randomization; however, adjust-
ment often improves efficiency without
compromising type 1 error rate.32,33 We
first estimated adjusted models for
treatment effects averaged over all
youth and next assessed modification
of treatment effects on mental health
by gender with gender-by-treatment
interactions (given previous evidence
of gender effect modification7,8). We
then assessed whether family violent
crime victimization modified treatment
effects by using treatment-by-victimization
interactions, retaining the gender-
treatment interactions. Effect modi-
fication is summarized graphically,
displaying average treatment effects on
mental health (experimental minus con-
trolmeans),foreachgender-victimization
subgroup. Negative values for treatment
coefficients indicate beneficial effects of
treatment.
When ITT effect modification tests
were statistically significant, we also
calculated adherence-adjusted effect
estimates based on instrumental vari-
able (IV) analysis, estimated with
2-stage least squares regression. We
estimated IV effects because ITT effect
estimates are probably attenuated
compared with effects of using the
voucher to move, given that many
families randomized to receive vouch-
ers did not use them. Direct compar-
isons of movers to nonmovers would
potentially be biased. IV analyses are
appropriate to correct for differential
adherence in randomized controlled
trials and avoid biases associated with
directly comparing compliers to non-
compliers.34,35 Under the main as-
sumption that treatment assignment
can only affect mental health indirectly,
via use of the voucher to move, treat-
ment assignment is a valid IV to esti-
mate the effects of using the vouchers
to move out of public housing on
mental health. The IV approach also
reveals whether patterns of ITT treat-
ment effect heterogeneity could be
attributable to lower adherence
rates among previously victimized
families.36 In MTO, IV effect estimates
are typically interpreted as the effect of
using the voucher among individuals
who did in fact use it.7,37
All analyses accounted for household
clustering, with weights accounting for
random assignment ratio changes and
attrition.7 We report robust SEs. We
imputed row-column values for miss-
ing outcome values (,1% for distress
and BPI and 4% for lifetime MDD). We
used M-Plus 6.11 for IRT analyses and
Stata 11.0 (Stata Corp, College Station,
TX) for all other analyses.

are similar to ITT estimates but ap-
proximately twice as large.
Confirming our novel hypothesis, vic-
timization adversely modified effects of
theMTOinterventionassignmentonthe
K6 and BPI; youth in victimized families
had worse average treatment effects
than their counterparts from families
who had not experienced victimization,
overall and within gender group (Fig 2).
For all 3 outcomes, girls from non-
victimized families were the only sub-
group to significantly benefit from the
intervention. Boys in victimized fami-
lies were the only subgroup signifi-
cantly harmed by the intervention (Fig
2 A and B).
Psychological distress illustrates these
patterns. The modest average benefi-
cialITTeffectoftreatmentofgirls(Table
2, B = 20.123, P = .044) masked larger
benefits for girls from nonvictimized
families (B = 20.192, 95% CI: 20.334 to
20.050, P = .008, ie, a 0.17 SD decrease
in distress [Cohen's D = 20.192/1.12338])
and an effect close to zero for girls
from victimized families (B = 20.027,
95% CI: 20.187 to 0.133, P = .74; Fig 2A).
Furthermore, the overall harmful ITT
effect among boys (B = 0.150, P = .020)
reflected substantial harm among boys
from victimized families (B = 0.243, 95%
CI: 0.076 to 0.410, P = .004) and null
effects among boys from nonvictimized
families (B = 0.078, 95% CI: 20.068 to
0.224, P = .29). Patterns for BPI (Fig 2A)
and MDD (Fig 2B) were strikingly sim-
ilar to those for distress. Effects were
marginally stronger for (and concen-
trated in) the low-poverty versus Sec-
tion 8 treatment group for distress and
BPI (Supplemental Figs 3 and 4).
Victimization-treatment interaction co-
efficients were at least marginally sig-
nificant for distress and BPI, indicating
adverse heterogeneity of treatment ef-
fects by baseline victimization (respec-
tively, B = 0.165, 95% CI: 20.017 to 0.347,
P = .076 and B = 0.235, 95% CI: 0.059
to 0.410, P = .009). There was an adverse,
but nonsignificant, effect modification
of treatment by victimization for MDD.
Adherence-adjusted IV estimates also
indicate significant treatment benefits
on distress and BPI for girls from
nonvictimized families, harmful effects
among boys from victimized families,
and null effects for the other 2 groups
(Fig 2C). Similar to ITTeffects, IV results
for MDD were null. IV effect estimates
of using a voucher to move were twice
as large as ITT estimates, as expected
given 51% treatment adherence.
DISCUSSION
We found differential intervention effects
on distress, behavior problems, and
MDD 4 to 7 years after adolescents
moved out of public housing into lower-
poverty neighborhoods in the MTO ex-
periment. Female adolescents experi-
enced beneficial mental health effects
of the MTO treatment, but male ado-
lescents experienced harmful effects.
Moreover, for both girls and boys, effects
of the MTO treatment were worse for
youth from families in which someone
was a victim of violent crime before
randomization. The MTO IV effect sizes
ranged from a harmful 0.42 to 0.53
SDs for boys and from a beneficial
0.23 to 0.32 SDs for girls for the di-
mensional outcomes. These are moder-
ate effect sizes38; indeed, the beneficial
effect for girls' distress is nearly that
obtained from psychotherapy treatment
in youth39 (especially notable because
psychotherapy is administered to clini-
cal populations,yetwesee similareffect
sizes here in a nonclinical sample).

Second-stage IV results presented here. The treatment variable represents treatment adherence, that is, whether the family used the housing subsidy to move. Two-staged least squares
regression models adjusted for site; race; household head marital status, employment, education, lived in neighborhood for 5 y or more, chats with neighbor at least once a week, no family in
neighborhood, no friends in neighborhood, very likely to tell neighbor if he or she saw neighbor's child getting into trouble, and has applied for Section 8 before; child is gifted; child had
problems with schoolwork or behavior; plus male, treatment, and treatment by male interaction. Models adjusted for family-level clustering, output with robust SEs, and weighted. IRT methods
were used to derive psychological distress and behavior problems. To assess robustness to misspecification of pre-randomization covariates in linear regression for binary outcome MDD, we
implemented a version of G-estimation64 which does not rely on correct specification of the outcome from linear regression but relies only on randomization of the instrument. Results were
almost identical (available on request), so we present results from conventional IV analysis.

Few previous publications evaluate
health effects of MTO at 4 to 7 years'
follow-up.7,8,40,41 Previous research
reported adverse effects of MTO on
overall youth self-rated health and
asthma; beneficial effects of MTO on
distress, lifetime MDD, and smoking
for adolescent girls; and, for boys,
null associations with mental health
outcomes and, unexpectedly, adverse
behavioral outcomes.7,8,41 The Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment recently released outcomes for
a younger cohort of children, 12 years
after baseline, showing similar gender
patterns.42 Statistical tests of gender
interactions were not reported how-
ever, so no formal replication is
available.
Our findings add to previous literature in
2 ways. We tested a specific explanation
for treatment effect heterogeneity: vul-
nerability due to previous crime victimi-
zation. Furthermore, we operationalized
health outcomes by using validated
latent variable methods, improving pre-
cision in measuring distress, which
substantively altered conclusions from
previous work.31 Specifically, we found
that MTO significantly elevated distress
for boys, in contrast to previous find-
ings, which were null.7,8
The null effects we found for behavior
problems among girls and MDD among
boys may reflect gendered expression
of mental health. Girls more commonly
manifest distress as mood disorders/
symptomatology, and boys more typi-
cally express externalizing disorders/
symptomatology.43,44 Our findings pres-
ent consistent patterns; adolescent
boys and youth from families with a
history of violent crime victimization did
not benefit from moves into lower-
poverty neighborhoods and in some
cases were harmed.
QualitativeevidencefromMTOsuggests
that girls may have benefited because

they escaped neighborhood environ-
ments with pervasive sexual harass-
ment and threats of sexual violence.45
In contrast, adolescent boys may have
had difficulty adjusting to changes in
social networks and relationships in
the new neighborhoods.46 Boys in high-
crime areas may cope by adhering to
context-specific oppositional "street"
cultures47 that are less advantageous
in lower-poverty neighborhoods. We
did not test these potential explan-
ations, although research on mecha-
nisms is clearly needed. A child's age or
developmental stage may also modify
treatment,39 but we did not test that
hypothesis in this study, although other
MTO analyses have.39,48,49 This remains
important to investigate.
Our findings suggest that gender is one
of several social determinants that
modifies children's capacity to benefit
from new resources and neighborhood
contexts, consistent with previous re-
search on child development.6 We
found harm specific to 1 group: boys
from families with a history of recent
crime victimization. This adds to emerg-
ing evidence emphasizing that low-
income children are often blocked
from achieving healthy, successful
adulthoods by an interlocking system of
adversity in which individual and neigh-
borhood socioeconomic disadvantage
compromise health via multiple path-
ways.6,50­52 Ameliorating these barriers
requires meaningful intersectoral col-
laboration, in particular, coordinating
housing and health services.
Housing Choice Vouchers (formerly
known as Section 8), on which MTO was
based, are central to US rental housing
assistance policy.53,54 Large-scale social
interventions of this kind, therefore,
should be designed and monitored with
an eye to health impacts and the
possibility of unintended negative con-
sequences for vulnerable populations.
Determining which children accrue
health benefits and which are harmed
may help enhance programs to improve
outcomes for all children. Recently, in-
novative intersectoral programs (eg,
medical legal partnerships,55 volunteer
programs such as Health Leads),56
which integrate social services into
health care settings, have demonstrated
promise for improving health outcomes
for low-income families. Social service
delivery programs are also increasingly
integrating health care; for example,
HOPE VI, a major federal housing re-
location program, requires tailored
supportive services for its residents,
including health care.57,58
An important question concerns whether
the neighborhood context, and/or
the move itself, influenced child men-
tal health. Although there is some re-
searchonthisquestionelsewhere,15,16,59,60
MTO cannot tease these apart because
of its bundled treatment. Our results
documented marginally stronger treat-
ment effects in the low-poverty group,
rather than the section 8 group, pro-
viding 1 clue that the type of neighbor-
hood to which families moved may have
mattered more for adolescent mental
health than the move itself. This im-
portant question for future research
may implicate other potential inter-
ventions such as place-based neigh-
borhood revitalization efforts to modify
neighborhoods directly.61
MTO's original aims focused on economic
self-sufficiency, not health,62 so mental
health was not assessed at baseline.
Additional data would have improved
statistical power and facilitated inves-
tigating differential treatment effects by
baseline health. Although we had limited
power given low prevalence of MDD, our
consistent pattern of results was tri-
angulated from different mental health
outcomes, including diagnostic, symp-
tomatology, internalizing, and external-
izing measures, which may jointly better
represent a broader universe of mental
health outcomes. We operationalized vi-
olent crime victimization at the family
level, assuming it affects the whole
family,63 because no individual-level var-
iable was available. Lastly, these findings
may not generalize to all adolescents
because MTO familieswere exceptionally
disadvantaged at baseline. Yet this pop-
ulation is of particular social relevance
as the target of means-tested policies.
CONCLUSIONS
The $70 million MTO demonstration
program sought to assess the potential
effects of moving low-income families
from high- to low-poverty neighbor-
hoods.24 Its experimental design places
MTO among the strongest existing stud-
ies of how changes in neighborhood
context affect children's mental health.
Our results show that the MTO program
benefited a robust group of adolescent
girls and harmed a particularly vulner-
able group of adolescent boys. Incor-
porating additional services across
sectors may be important for facilitating
successful outcomes among all families
receiving housing mobility assistance.
