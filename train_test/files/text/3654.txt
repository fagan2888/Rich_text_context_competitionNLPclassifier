Introduction
This research argues for repositioning Service Learning
from a peripheral tool in public education to a necessary part
of public education, with the transformative goal of empow-
ered communities operating in a social-collaborative frame-
work from communities dependent on overburdened state
and local government programs and services. Repositioning
Service Learning from optional projects to required projects
is dependent on a shift in thought about Service Learning, in
which there is recognition of Service Learning as a means of
providing that preparation. Acceleration of the societal shift
could occur via Invitational Rhetoric and revisioning the
idea of "service" in society.
Service Learning programs are implemented at all aca-
demic levels, from elementary schools to higher education,
and yet Service Learning is not a part of the common core
curriculum in the national educational system. Service
Learning remains peripheral when compared with basics
such as mathematics, English, history, and science, and yet
educating students on the fundamentals of citizenship and
societal functions is a necessary part of social development.
To "mainstream" Service Learning, this research proposes
two initiatives: (a) Foster the idea of the Service Learning
experience as citizenship/community building by associating
the experience with embedded cultural values and (b) apply
Invitational Rhetoric in persuading students and parents to
view Service Learning as something other than imposed ser-
vitude or social consciousness for a grade.
Literature Review
Research reveals measured positive outcomes in Service
Learning models in the education framework. Eyler (2002)
examined the role of reflection in effective programs and
argued that Service Learning models should be supported
within institutions and through national policy. Hunter and
Brisbin, Jr. (2000) discovered that students who have a
Service Learning experience will view the experience posi-
tively and will be inclined to seek other service opportunities.
Jones and Abes (2004) found that outcomes of a Service
Learning course extended beyond completion of the course,
providing a context for reflection on individual identity, rela-
tionships to others, and an internally defined sense of self.
Melchior and Bailis (2002) analyzed three national Service
Learning initiatives for conclusions about such programs'
impact on students' civic engagement: (a) Serve America, (b)
Learn and Serve, and (c) Active Citizenship Today. Based on

Invitational Rhetoric and
the Case for Service Learning
Christina L. Hicks-Goldston1
Abstract
This research argues for repositioning Service Learning as a necessary part of public education, with the transformative goal
of empowered communities operating in a social-collaborative framework from communities dependent on overburdened
state and local government programs and services. Such repositioning depends on recognition of Service Learning as a
means of providing that preparation.To "mainstream" Service Learning, this research proposes two initiatives: (a) Foster the
idea of the Service Learning experience as citizenship/community building by associating the experience with embedded
cultural values and (b) apply Invitational Rhetoric in persuading students and parents to view Service Learning as something
other than imposed servitude or social consciousness for a grade. Service Learning has proven to be successful in changing
students' attitudes about their place in society. If Service Learning were a part of the common educational core, the potential
for repositioning its value to citizenry would be highly expanded. Because many communities lack access to education and
training for the citizenry, Service Learning could supply that link to empowerment.

their research, the authors found that Service Learning can
provide young people with meaningful experiences as active
and effective citizens and assist them in acquiring necessary
skills for identifying issues in their community and acting on
them. Moely, McFarland, Miron, Mercer, and Ilustre (2002)
had similar results, with students demonstrating expected
changes in civic attitudes, while rating their own skills for
engagement and expressing plans to be involved in civic
activities in the future. Morgan and Streb (2001) found that
students' immersion in Service Learning exercises in which
they had a voice increased their level of satisfaction with
Service Learning, as well as their self-concept, political
engagement, and attitudes toward out-groups. Saltmarsh
(2005) argued that civic learning is an integral part of the
Service Learning experience, resulting in "civic professional-
ism." He asserted that "civic learning draws attention to the
civic dimensions of education, emphasizing the need not only
for development of the disciplinary mastery and competence,
but also for civic awareness and purpose," in his assessment
(Saltmarsh, 2005, p. 2). Sedlak, Doheny, Panthofer, and
Anaya (2003) found that all beginning students developed
critical-thinking skills in Service Learning experiences, and
that Service Learning experiences benefit students, faculty,
agencies, and educational programs. Strange (2004) con-
cluded that Service Learning provides students with a firm
foundation for academic majors and overall academic perfor-
mance.
DefiningTerms: Service Learning,
Historical Context, and the Concept
of Citizenship
Butin (2010) addressed a common theme in any Service
Learning discussion--a varying concept of what it actually
means. The author notes that for many scholars/educators,
defining Service Learning rejects the educational model of
transferring knowledge "downward," from knowledge-
able teachers to passive students in 50-min increments.
Communication scholars would see the obvious similarity to
the "Single Bullet Theory" of mass communication, in which
a single message is transmitted simultaneously to a passive
mass audience, who receives the message and instantly shares
a reaction. Whereas a "downward" education model would
have a teacher at the front of the classroom "transmitting" a
learning initiative to a room of students simultaneously
"receiving/processing" information, Service Learning pro-
vides an experiential factor of activity on the part of the
students, in which their participation in the learning event
provides context and introduces critical-thinking and problem-
solving skills. Butin offers that Service Learning is "a
pedagogical practice and theoretical orientation that pro-
vokes us to more carefully examine, rethink, and reenact
the visions, policies, and practices of our classrooms, and
educational institutions" (p. 19), as well as reassess teaching
methods and scholarship.
Incorporating Service Learning into the national core cur-
riculum would involve shifting societal thought, and societal
shifts in thought occur within historical context. At present
and historically, the United States continues to feel the effects
of the economic recession that began in 2007. Finances of
state governments are closely tied to prevailing economic
conditions. The economic recession that began in the fourth
quarter of 2007 and lasted through the second quarter of 2009
created great fiscal stress for all levels of government and
produced a strong climate for reexamining the roles played
by every level--federal, state, and local. State governments
play several roles in this intergovernmental fiscal system,
including creator and financier of some local government ser-
vices; conduit for, and redistributor of, federal funds; and pro-
viding direct public services such as health and hospitals,
public safety, and highways. State government general expen-
diture in 2009 totaled US$1,554 billion. The 3.3% increase in
general expenditure from 2008 to 2009 was in contrast with
the 1.2% decline in general revenues. By contrast, from 2007
to 2008, general revenue rose 3.9% and general expenditure
rose 5.6%. During 2009, 31.3% of state government general
expenditure was in the form of grants and aid to local govern-
ments (including independent school district governments),
thereby underlining the states' role as a financial resource for
their subordinate governments (http://www2.census.gov).
The nationwide state budget crisis creates a need for pro-
active citizens who can shape their communities rather than
appeal to overburdened state offices and services. Ideally, a
national educational core Service Learning program would
introduce the idea of "empowered citizenry" from the ele-
mentary education level and continue to promote such atti-
tudes throughout the program, while allowing students to
become educated in community-building skills. For students
in upper-level and higher education, the emphasis would
shift to necessary job skills and enhanced personal develop-
ment, while continuing their educational social-collaborative
experiences.
Varlotta (2001) offered that when college-age students
were asked to define "citizenship," many students were
guided by a political philosophy called "liberalism," a phi-
losophy that theorizes the primacy of the individual citizen
(the author termed it the "ME") over the democratic com-
munity (the author termed it the "WE"); for liberals, "citi-
zen" refers to the rational, autonomous, equal members of
the state who enjoy the freedoms associated with democracy.
The author then bases such thoughts in the historical docu-
ments of the Constitution of the United States of America,
the Declaration of Independence, and the Federalist Papers,
and the contained tenets of those documents of rationality--
the capacity for reasoned mental activity; equality--a poten-
tial capacity for equality rather than an actual state of being;
autonomy--with an individual's identity (as a citizen or
Hicks-Goldston 3
otherwise) as autonomous, existing independently of social
context; and freedom--defined as "freedom from the state,"
a type of laissez-faire institution with minimal constraints;
and "freedom to" rule themselves as equal members of the
democratic state. In such consciousness, the "ME" takes pri-
ority over the "WE."
Varlotta (2001) noted that, in contrast, the Communitarian
Community denotes a consensual community grounded in
and bound by a "common good." Varlotta's research argues
for an overlapping of the "ME" and the "WE" as individual
citizens negotiate their roles within a collective culture with
shared concerns. That complex yet meaningful scenario
should be included in an effective Service Learning­based
education--an awareness of the self as an active, participat-
ing member of a society/community who retains individual-
ity while still recognizing the need to work for a better
community experience.
Value Analysis and
Invitational Rhetoric
Sillars and Gronbeck (2001) stated that "touchstone"
American value systems include the Puritan-Pioneer Value
System, which is rooted in the idea that persons have an obli-
gation to themselves and their community to work hard at
whatever they do; the Personal Success Value System, which
involves a highly pragmatic concern for the material happi-
ness of the individual; and the Collectivist Value System, in
which the community becomes the vehicle for personal
release and empowerment, such as the Civil Rights move-
ment or the Feminist movement (Sillars & Gronbeck, 2001).
Although those values are evident in some Service Learning
activities, repeatedly linking Service Learning to cultural
values would make integration of Service Learning into the
educational core more apparent.
First, this proposal argues for attaching the Puritan-Pioneer
Value System to Service Learning projects at the elementary
educational level, and using positive-value words such as
activity, community, dedication, duty, family, responsibility,
and virtue when discussing the projects, with the goal of
establishing strong self-identity while instilling a work ethic
attached to the community. This addresses the ME/WE
dichotomy early in a child/student's life and allows for that
student to remain self-aware while learning about his or her
society's history, government, and various societal functions
in the life of individuals or individual families. Service
Learning projects at this level would need to be based on the
developmental capabilities of the children and academic
resources of the school and surrounding community. For
example, children in middle childhood might show more
independence from parents and family, start to think about the
future, understand more about their place in the world, pay
more attention to friendships and teamwork, and want to be
liked and accepted by friends (http://www.cdc.gov). In those
early grades, it would be important to make Service Learning
projects adaptable to the child's development, such as the les-
son offered in Project Citizen's "What Is Authority?," in
which the child analyzes the role of government and learns
the concept of authority (http://www.civiced.org). The idea of
"lawful citizenry" respecting the community laws, such as
"No Littering," could be reinforced by a clean-up day in
which the students clean up the litter on the playground.
By the time the child is in the fifth grade, things have
changed. Children in this age group might start to form
stronger, more complex friendships and peer relationships. It
becomes more emotionally important to have friends, espe-
cially of the same sex. They face more academic challenges
at school, become more independent from the family, begin
to see the point of view of others more clearly, and have an
increased attention span (http://www.cdc.gov).
For those children, the "Learning to Give" website offers
a lesson titled, "We the Kids--The Three Branches and Me,"
in which students learn concepts such as how to work in
cooperative groups, name and define the three branches of
government, list the three characteristics of the trial and
appellate courts, and create an editorial cartoon, among other
things. They may present the "Bill of Rights" through a song
with creative movement to a retirement community or
another classroom in the school. The lesson also encourages
students to create posters that instruct about the core demo-
cratic values. Students are encouraged to display posters
around the school to share their knowledge and creativity
with other students and visitors to the school (http://www.
learningtogive.org).
Second, this proposal argues for attaching the Collectivist
Value System to Service Learning projects at the secondary
level, and using words such as brotherhood/sisterhood, coop-
eration, equality, humanism, social good, and unity when dis-
cussing the projects, with the goal of establishing awareness
of shared community concerns and the need for working
together. Students at the secondary education level could be
expected to have a more developed self-identity at this point
in their academic career, and the communitarian approach
would still address the ME/WE dichotomy, but students
would experience an emphasis on community contribution
for a common good. Service Learning projects at this level
would become more complex, allowing for students to use
critical-thinking and problem-solving skills when analyzing
issues in their communities. Once again, Learning to Give
addresses the level of awareness in the middle school student
with a lesson titled, "Power to Make a Difference: Intro to
Philanthropy Unit." The students learn to define "philan-
thropy"; develop awareness of the individual philanthropists
and the causes they support; use philanthropy vocabulary
words, such as civic responsibility, common good, founda-
tion, and nonprofit sector; research a philanthropic organiza-
tion and its mission; create a persuasive radio advertisement
for a nonprofit organization; and choose an organization to
4 SAGE Open
personally support with a donation of time or treasure and
justify the choice (http://www.learningtogive.org).
Finally, this proposal argues for attaching the Personal
Success Value System to Service Learning projects at the
higher education level, and using words such career, dignity,
security, identity, personal recognition, and respect when dis-
cussing the projects, with the goal of assisting the individual
with career pursuits, while training the individual to assist in
community building as well. At this level, whether the stu-
dent is pursuing the final year for a high school diploma,
4-year degree, or a certification program, the emphasis would
be on developing skills and expertise that not only would ben-
efit the student in a career but might also be used on a com-
munal level, even on a part-time or volunteer basis. At this
point, students would be expected to demonstrate a semipro-
fessional awareness of behavior and practice that could ben-
efit their communities. Projects would be at the most advanced
level of sophistication and would directly address community
concerns.
High school and college-age students are able to use their
levels of awareness about the community and combine that
awareness with communication skills to be peer mentors,
volunteers, and active youth. Service Learning models at this
level range from using Service Learning in public speaking
classes for persuasive speeches to using Service Learning as
part of studies on aging. Individual classes and disciplines
use a variety of projects at high schools, community col-
leges, and universities.
The desired result of the repositioned educational model
would be one in which Service Learning is present at every
educational level, and projects reflect/reinforce embedded
cultural codes. As previously stated, Service Learning is
experiential, and including that kind of learning in the educa-
tional core would allow students to view their communities
from the inside out, experiencing varying roles and responsi-
bilities in which they trace community issues from symptom
to cause. This fosters the opportunity for creativity and criti-
cal thinking in which a situation is introduced, and students
are asked to analyze that situation and propose a solution--
minus judgment.
A key component for repositioning Service Learning is
revisioning the idea of "service" as it relates to the academic
experience. Invitational Rhetoric allows educators to pres-
ent Service Learning as an opportunity for developing citi-
zenship and personal awareness while acquiring necessary
life skills. Invitational Rhetoric produces a consensus of
understanding, because the rhetor is inviting the audience to
accept the invitation to listen to a particular perspective, and
thereby receive the opportunity to better understand it. In
presenting a particular perspective, the invitational rhetor
does not judge or denigrate others' perspectives but is open
to and tries to appreciate and validate those perspectives,
even if they differ dramatically from the rhetor's own (Foss
& Griffin, 1995).
The key factor of Invitational Rhetoric is in the approach.
The stance taken by invitational rhetors toward their audiences
is obviously different from that assumed by traditional rhetors.
Invitational rhetors do not believe they have the right to claim
that their experiences or perspectives are superior to those of
their audience members and refuse to impose their perspectives
on them (Foss & Griffin, 1995).
As noted by Lozano-Reich and Cloud (2009), Invitational
Rhetoric has had significant influence on feminist scholar-
ship. Feminist rhetorical scholars present the format as one
in which civil discourse is possible when discussing redefin-
ing social roles. There is no distinct movement or social shift
rooted entirely in Invitational Rhetorical origins; the style is
generally regarded as one in which the emphasis is based in
civility and ethical discourse. That would be a leading factor
in using the format for adopting Service Learning into the
national core curriculum, because there is no blame attached
to the current model--only an opportunity to create a new
component in the national curriculum. Another factor influ-
encing the choice of the Invitational Rhetorical format is the
need for equality in the argument, without presupposing
"superiority" of service behavior. In introducing Service
Learning as part of an educational process, the presentation
must be one of shared opportunities for all involved--
learner, educator, community--and not a need to be morally
superior by learning information and skills to serve the com-
munity. Everyone must be equally committed to the project,
and enjoy benefits.
Novak and Bonine (2009) introduced the concept of
Invitational Rhetoric as a form of persuasion in a public
speaking course and found that using the format in persuasive
speeches made students more comfortable than the traditional
format of coercion. The students were less threatened by an
Invitational Rhetoric approach because the goal was not
about convincing the listener of a "right" or "wrong" way of
thinking--the goal of the speech was establishing under-
standing (Novak & Bonine, 2009).
"Service" is a loaded word, with a multitude of associa-
tions, from "service to one's country" referring to military
personnel, to careers in the "service industry" referring to
jobs ranging from waiting tables ("servers") to hotel manage-
ment, and "customer service" referring to answering custom-
ers' complaints or frequently asked questions. "Community
Service" refers to anything from school-sponsored activities,
to neighborhood projects, to judicial sentences imposed on an
individual for minor legal infractions. With such varying con-
cepts of service, the additional varying concepts of Service
Learning make the idea of required Service Learning experi-
ences even more problematic.
Invitational Rhetoric would present Service Learning
according to the previously discussed values, with both
"Service" and "Learning" attached to positive, supported
cultural values. It would lack judgment--no student would
be lauded as "good" or "better" than others because of the
participation, nor would the student be "sentenced" to serv-
ing the community for a grade. By attaching an invitation to
continue a tradition of core values of the dedicated individ-
ual who works for the social good of his or her community
Hicks-Goldston 5
while maintaining dignity and earning respect from his or her
peers on the way to his or her career, the rhetor provides a
positive association for the student educated in a Service
Learning curriculum.
Service Learning projects would balance the ME/WE
dichotomy by allowing students to see what their efforts pro-
duced and gain a sense of accomplishment in completed
projects, while hopefully transforming their perspectives
about issues in their community.
Conclusion
Service Learning has proven to be successful in changing
students'attitudes about their place in society, even as it exists
as peripheral learning. If Service Learning were a part of the
common educational core, the potential for repositioning its
value to citizenry would be highly expanded. With local, state,
and federal budgets being tightened, it is up to citizens to
become community builders and shapers. However, many
communities lack access to education and training for the
citizenry, and Service Learning could supply that link to
empowerment. A variety of factors must be considered in
implementing a national educational Service Learning core,
from cost of training educators in Service Learning to feasibil-
ity of more advanced projects, but the idea remains possible
with an organized framework. Although there might be initial
costs and training involved, the long-term benefits of a
Service Learning curriculum gain credibility as more state and
local programs are lost to budget cuts. The vision of autono-
mous citizens giving back to their communities seems less
idealistic and more necessary than ever.
