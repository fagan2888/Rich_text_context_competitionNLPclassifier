Blood Lead Below 0.48 mol/L (10 g/dL) and Mortality
Among US Adults
Andy Menke, MPH; Paul Muntner, PhD; Vecihi Batuman, MD;

Background--Blood lead levels above 0.48 mol/L (10 g/dL) in adults have been associated with increased risk of
cardiovascular, cancer, and all-cause mortality. The objective of the present study was to determine the association
between blood lead levels below 0.48 mol/L and mortality in the general US population.
Methods and Results--Blood lead levels were measured in a nationally representative sample of 13 946 adult participants
of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey recruited in 1988 to 1994 and followed up for up to 12
years for all-cause and cause-specific mortality. The geometric mean blood lead level in study participants was 0.12
mol/L (2.58 g/dL). After multivariate adjustment, the hazard ratios (95% CI) for comparisons of participants in the
highest tertile of blood lead (0.17 mol/L [3.62 g/dL]) with those in the lowest tertile (0.09 mol/L [1.94
g/dL]) were 1.25 (1.04 to 1.51; Ptrend
across tertiles0.002) for all-cause mortality and 1.55 (1.08 to 2.24; Ptrend
across
tertiles0.003) for cardiovascular mortality. Blood lead level was significantly associated with both myocardial
infarction and stroke mortality, and the association was evident at levels 0.10 mol/L (2 g/dL). There was no
association between blood lead and cancer mortality in this range of exposure.
Conclusions--The association between blood lead levels and increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was
observed at substantially lower blood lead levels than previously reported. Despite the marked decrease in blood lead
levels over the past 3 decades, environmental lead exposures remain a significant determinant of cardiovascular
mortality in the general population, constituting a major public health problem. (Circulation. 2006;114:1388-1394.)

Blood lead levels above 1.93 mol/L (40 g/dL) have
been associated with increased risks of cardiovascular,
cancer, and all-cause mortality in several occupational co-
horts. In the general population, Lustberg and Silbergeld1 also
reported significant relationships between blood lead levels
above 0.48 mol/L (10 g/dL) and cardiovascular, cancer,
and all-cause mortality.
Editorial p 1347
Clinical Perspective p 1394
Environmental lead exposures in the United States have
generally declined since the mid-1970s, largely because of
the phase-out of lead in gasoline, which was finalized in
1996. In addition, lead-based paints were restricted in use,
and a voluntary program removed lead solder from food
cans.2,3 Among US adults, the geometric mean blood lead
level decreased from 0.63 mol/L (13.1 g/dL) in 1976 to
1980 to 0.08 mol/L (1.6 g/dL) in 1999 to 2002. Currently,
99% of US adults have blood lead levels below 0.48 mol/L
(10 g/dL).2 To the best of our knowledge, the association of
blood lead levels below 0.48 mol/L (10 g/dL) with
mortality end points has never been investigated.
The purpose of the present analysis was to evaluate the
association of blood lead levels below 0.48 mol/L (10
g/dL) with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the
general US population. To do so, we analyzed data from the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) Mortality Study, a cohort study based on a
nationally representative sample of US adults in which blood
lead was measured in 1988 to 1994, with participants fol-
lowed up for up to 12 years.
Methods
Study Population
NHANES III was a stratified, multistage probability survey designed
to select a representative sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized
US population.4 Overall, 18 629 adults 20 years of age and older
completed the NHANES III interview and examination between
1988 and 1994. After the exclusion of 2482 participants who were
missing data for blood lead, 707 participants with blood lead 0.48
mol/L (10 g/dL), and 1494 participants who were missing other

study covariates, 13 946 NHANES III participants were available for
the present analysis. The present study used a cohort design to
evaluate the association between blood lead levels in adult NHANES
III participants with their mortality through December 31, 2000.
The protocol for NHANES III was approved by the National
Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention Institutional Review Board. All participants gave in-
formed consent.
Baseline Data Collection
NHANES III baseline data were collected during an in-home
interview and a subsequent visit to a mobile examination center.
During the in-home interview, demographic information, including
age, race-ethnicity, and sex, was collected with a standardized
questionnaire. Additional data collected during the in-home inter-
view included urban residence, education, household income, phys-
ical activity, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, current med-
ication use, menopausal status for women, and history of diabetes
mellitus, myocardial infarction, stroke, and/or cancer.
Blood pressure was measured 3 times during the in-home inter-
view and 3 additional times during the visit to the mobile examina-
tion center. All blood pressure measurements for each participant
were averaged, and hypertension was defined as systolic blood
pressure 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg
and/or current use of blood pressure­lowering medication. Height
and weight were measured, and body mass index was calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
Participants had a blood specimen drawn from their antecubital
vein by a trained phlebotomist according to a standardized protocol.
Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was quantified by latex-enhanced
nephelometry. Participants were classified as having CRP 3.0
mg/L, between 3.0 and 9.9 mg/L, or 10.0 mg/L. Plasma glucose
was measured by an enzymatic reaction. Diabetes mellitus was
defined as a fasting plasma glucose 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL), a
nonfasting plasma glucose 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), or a
self-reported history of diabetes mellitus with concurrent use of
antidiabetic medication. Total serum cholesterol was measured
enzymatically. Serum creatinine was measured by the Jaffe modified
kinetic method. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated with
the Modification of Diet and Renal Disease equation after we aligned
the serum creatinine concentrations with the assay used in the
development of the equation.5,6 Individuals were classified as having
an estimated GFR 90, 60 to 89, or 60 mL · min1 · 1.73 m2.
A detailed description of the methods used in the measurement of
blood lead levels is available elsewhere.7 All materials used for
collecting and processing blood lead specimens were screened for
possible lead contamination. Blood specimens for lead measurement
were shipped on dry ice to the NHANES laboratory at the National
Centers for Environmental Health at the Centers for Diseases Control
and Prevention in Atlanta, Ga. Blood lead was measured by graphite
furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry as described by Sassa
and colleagues.8 The detection limit was 0.05 mol/L (1.0 g/dL).
For 8.1% of study participants with lead levels below the detection
limit, we imputed a level of 0.03 mol/L (0.7 g/dL). The analytical
laboratory followed extensive quality control procedures.7 To ensure
accurate measurements of blood lead, blinded quality control pools
were incorporated with NHANES III participants' samples. This
program was incorporated for the entirety of NHANES III (ie, from
1988 through 1994). On the basis of these quality control data, no
drift in blood lead occurred because of measurement error.
Mortality Follow-Up
NHANES III participants aged 17 years at baseline were followed
up for mortality through December 31, 2000. The method of
probabilistic matching was used to link NHANES III participants
with the National Death Index to ascertain vital status and cause of
death. Matching was based on 12 identifiers for each participant (eg,
Social Security number, sex, and date of birth). Identical matching
methodology applied to the NHANES I Epidemiological Follow-up
Study for validation purposes found that 96.1% of deceased partic-
ipants and 99.4% of living participants were classified correctly.
Cause of death was determined by the underlying cause listed on
death certificates. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD)
revision 9 (ICD-9) was used for deaths that occurred between 1988
and 1998, and ICD revision 10 (ICD-10) was used for deaths during
1999 and 2000. Cause-specific mortality was categorized as cardio-
vascular disease (ICD-9 codes 390 to 434 and 436 to 459; ICD-10
codes I00-I99), myocardial infarction (ICD-9 codes 410 to 414 and
429.2; ICD-10 codes I20-I25), stroke (ICD-9 codes 430 to 434 and
436 to 438; ICD-10 codes I60-I69), cancer (ICD-9 codes 140 to 239;
ICD-10 codes C00-C97 and D00-D48), and lung cancer (ICD-9
codes 162.2 to 162.9; ICD-10 code C34).
Statistical Methods
Participants were categorized into blood lead tertiles based on the
weighted population distribution. Baseline covariate levels were
calculated by tertile of blood lead level after standardization to the
age, race-ethnicity, and sex distribution of the US population. Age-,
race-ethnicity­, and sex-standardized differences in baseline covari-
ates across tertiles of lead were evaluated by linear regression for
continuous variables and logistic regression for dichotomous
variables.
For cohort analysis of the association between blood lead and
mortality, follow-up for each study participant was calculated as the
time between their NHANES III examination and the date of death,
the date on which they turned 90 years of age, or December 31, 2000,
whichever occurred first. The hazard ratios and 95% CIs of all-cause,
cardiovascular, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cancer mortality
associated with each tertile of lead level compared with the first
tertile were calculated by Cox regression. Initial models were
adjusted for age, race-ethnicity, and sex. Subsequent models were
further adjusted for urban residence, cigarette smoking, alcohol
consumption, education, physical activity, household income, meno-
pausal status for women, body mass index, CRP, total cholesterol,
and diabetes mellitus. Additional models were further adjusted for
hypertension and GFR category, which are potential intermediate
factors in the causal pathway between lead exposure and mortality.
Tests for linear trend across tertiles of blood lead were computed by
including tertile of lead as a continuous variable in the Cox
regression models. Sensitivity analyses were conducted after exclu-
sion of participants with a history of cardiovascular disease or
cancer.
To further explore the dose­response relationship of blood lead
level with mortality, we used restricted quadratic splines with knots
at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the blood lead distribution
(0.05 mol/L [1.00 g/dL], 0.13 mol/L [2.67 g/dL], and 0.29
mol/L [5.98 g/dL], respectively). Finally, the association between
blood lead as a continuous variable and mortality was determined
overall and for subgroups defined by age, race-ethnicity, sex,
menopausal status, urban and rural residence, cigarette smoking,
overweight, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and level of estimated
GFR. For analyses that included blood lead level as a continuous
variable, lead was log-transformed owing to its skewness, and the
hazard ratios of mortality end points are presented for a 3.4-fold
increase in blood lead. This increase corresponds to the difference
between the 80th and 20th percentiles of the blood lead distribution
(0.24 mol/L [4.92 g/dL] versus 0.07 mol/L [1.46 g/dL],
respectively). The proportionality assumptions of the Cox models
were evaluated with Schoenfeld residuals. Data were analyzed with
SUDAAN (version 9.0; Research Triangle Institute, Research Tri-
angle Park, NC) to account for the complex NHANES sampling
design, which included unequal probabilities of selection, oversam-
pling, and nonresponse.

Mexican American, and male (Table 1). Among women,
those who were postmenopausal were more likely to have
higher lead levels. Also, those with higher lead levels were
more likely to have a household income $20 000, to be a
current smoker, and to consume alcohol and were less likely
to have a high school education and to exercise 3 or more
times per week. Mean total cholesterol, the prevalence of
hypertension, the prevalence of reduced GFR, and the prev-
alence of a history of cardiovascular disease were higher at
higher lead levels. In contrast, mean body mass index and the
prevalence of diabetes mellitus and elevated CRP were lower
at higher blood lead levels.
Blood lead levels were associated with increased all-cause
mortality (Table 2). The multivariate adjusted hazard ratio of
all-cause mortality for the highest versus the lowest tertile
was 1.25 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.51; Ptrend
across tertiles0.002).
When cause-specific deaths were investigated, the increased
mortality was concentrated in cardiovascular deaths. The
multivariate adjusted hazard ratios for the highest versus the
lowest tertile of lead level were 1.55 (1.08 to 2.24), 1.89 (1.04
to 3.43), and 2.51 (1.20 to 5.26), respectively, for cardiovas-
cular, myocardial infarction, and stroke mortality (each Ptrend
0.05). In contrast, blood lead was not associated with the
risk of cancer mortality in this range (Table 2). For lung
cancer, the multivariate adjusted hazard ratios for the middle
and highest tertiles versus the lowest tertile were 0.70 (0.34 to
1.42) and 0.79 (0.40 to 1.58). In spline regression models, the
increase in all-cause and cardiovascular deaths was evident at
blood lead levels 0.10 mol/L (2.0 g/dL; Figure 1).
After multivariate adjustment, the hazard ratio (95% CI)
for a 3.4-fold increase in blood lead level was 1.34 (1.16 to
1.54) for all-cause mortality, 1.53 (1.21 to 1.94) for cardio-
vascular mortality, 1.78 (1.18 to 2.67) for myocardial infarc-
tion mortality, and 1.59 (1.08 to 2.34) for stroke mortality.
The results were markedly consistent across subgroups.
All-cause and cardiovascular mortality were positively asso-
ciated with higher lead levels in all subgroups, and no
significant interactions were present (Figure 2; all probability
values for interaction 0.05).
Discussion
In this large, population-based prospective study, we identi-
fied a direct association between higher blood lead and
increased mortality at substantially lower blood lead levels
than reported previously. Indeed, an increased risk of cardio-
vascular, myocardial infarction, and stroke mortality was
evident at blood lead levels 0.10 mol/L (2.0 g/dL). This
increased mortality affected non-Hispanic whites, non-
Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans and both males and
females. In contrast, there was no increased cancer mortality
risk at these ranges of exposure. The finding of no increased
cancer mortality risk in the present study is consistent with
experimental evidence in which increased numbers of tumors
are induced in rodents only after relatively high doses.
In the occupational setting, blood lead levels above 1.93
mol/L (40 g/dL) have been repeatedly demonstrated to be
associated with increased risk of elevated blood pressure,
impaired renal function, and cancer. Using data from the
NHANES II Mortality Follow-Up Study, including follow-up
from 1976 through 1992, Lustberg and Silbergeld1 also
identified a significant association between blood lead levels

cancer mortality. Blood lead levels in adults at the time of
NHANES II (geometric mean 0.63 mol/L [13.1 g/dL])
were considerably higher than those in NHANES III.3 As a
consequence, the association between blood lead and mortal-
ity was not evaluated over the blood lead range investigated

blood lead levels were nonsignificantly higher in incident
cases of ischemic heart disease and stroke than in noncases,

British Regional Heart Study was also relatively high (mean
0.74 mol/L [15.3 g/dL]), and dose­response relationships
below 0.48 mol/L (10 g/dL) were not reported. Accumu-
lating evidence indicates that blood lead levels 0.48 mol/L
(10 g/dL) are associated with several health outcomes,
including peripheral arterial disease, impaired renal function,
and elevated blood pressure.10­14 The present study adds
important data on total and cardiovascular mortality, end
points of unquestionable public health relevance, to the list of
health outcomes that are associated with blood lead levels
below 0.48 mol/L (10 g/dL).
The association between lead and cardiovascular disease is
biologically plausible. Increases in blood pressure and renal
damage have been observed after induction of lead exposure
in rodent models.15,16 However, because these experimental
studies have been conducted at doses that produce blood lead
levels in rodents 10 times the median reported in NHANES
III, the relevance of these studies to the range of blood lead
levels reported in the present study is uncertain. In other
epidemiological studies, associations between blood lead
with increased blood pressure and decreased GFR have been
observed at blood lead levels 0.48 mol/L (10 g/dL).2,10,17,18
However, the extent to which blood pressure and renal
impairment mediated the effect of lead in the present study is
unclear. Although the association between blood lead and
cardiovascular disease outcomes persisted after adjustment
for estimated GFR, estimated GFR is considered a crude
measure of renal function. Studies using more sensitive
biomarkers of early kidney damage and renal tubular dys-
function, such as cystatin C, retinal binding protein, and other
low-molecular-weight proteins, may be informative in under-
standing the mechanism underlying lead-associated cardio-
vascular disease.15 Weaver and colleagues19 have reported
that hyperfiltration can be measured in workers exposed to
lead at substantially lower levels than those associated with
decrements in estimated GFR. Alterations in signal transduc-
tion that involve renal pathways (eg, angiotensin and vaso-
pressin) have been reported in animal models and also need to
be investigated. Additionally, lead may increase cardiovas-
cular risk via inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase,
although the evidence for this mechanism in humans is
mixed.20­22 Other biologically plausible mechanisms by
which lead may increase cardiovascular risk include effects
on neuromuscular control of vascular tone and/or central
nervous system neurohumoral regulation of vascular func-
tion, sodium transport abnormalities, and alterations in cyto-
solic calcium regulation.23­26 Additional research is needed to
establish the mechanism responsible for lead-related mortal-
ity below 0.48 mol/L(10 g/dL).
The findings from the present study need to be considered
within the context of its limitations. Perhaps the most impor-
tant limitation was the reliance on a single blood lead
measurement to assess exposure. Blood lead, with a half-life
of 30 days, reflects primarily recent external exposures,
although it is also influenced by long-term exposures through
efflux of lead from bone stores. Both blood lead, which
reflects recent exposure, and bone lead, which reflects cumu-
lative exposure, have been associated with blood pressure
increases.27­29 Thus, it is unclear whether the adverse health
effects of lead observed here were associated with current or
cumulative exposures. In addition, because of declining lead
levels in the decades before lead ascertainment in the present
analysis, it is unclear whether the observed increased risk in
mortality was due to lead exposure at baseline or lead
mobilization from the skeleton. In the latter scenario, blood
lead levels in 1988 to 1994 may reflect prior exposure. The
results of the present study emphasize the need for cumula-
tive lead measurements, such as bone lead, which would
provide a more accurate characterization of the relationship
between long-term lead exposure and mortality. Furthermore,
blood lead levels decreased in the US population during the
follow-up period, from a geometric mean of 0.13 mol/L
(2.72 g/dL) in 1988 to 1994 to 0.08 mol/L (1.64 g/dL) in
1999 to 2002. Because of regression dilution bias, the
Figure 2. Multivariate adjusted relative
hazards of all-cause and cardiovascular
mortality. Hazard ratios were calculated
for a 3.4-fold increase in blood lead with
log­blood lead as a continuous variable.
This increase corresponds to the differ-
ence between the 80th and 20th percen-
tiles of the blood lead distribution (0.24
mol/L [4.92 g/dL] versus 0.07 mol/L
[1.46 g/dL], respectively).

decrease in blood lead observed at the population level
implies that the results of the present study are conservative
and that the lead­mortality relationship may be stronger than
reported. An additional limitation was the lack of active
follow-up of NHANES III study participants. Therefore,
incident nonfatal events were not obtained. As a conse-
quence, the present findings cannot be generalized to nonfatal
events. Although the reliability of mortality follow-up
through the National Death Index is very high (98.5%), this
method is based on death certificates, which may contain
inaccurate information on causes of death. Follow-up was
censored at age 90 years because mortality was very high
after this age, and few participants contributed person-time
experience in this age category. However, all analyses were
repeated without censoring of participants aged 90 years,
and the results were remarkably similar. Finally, we cannot
rule out residual confounding by sociodemographic determi-
nants of lead exposure. We note, however, that the associa-
tion of lead with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality
persisted after adjustment for race-ethnicity, household in-
come, education, and urban residence. In addition, the lead­
mortality association was observed for cardiovascular dis-
eases but not for cancer, which makes it less likely that
residual confounding by sociodemographic factors could
explain our findings.
Despite these limitations, the present study maintains
several strengths. NHANES III data were collected by a
rigorous study protocol with extensive quality control proce-
dures and with technicians trained and certified in all data
collection procedures. The results are representative of the
US noninstitutionalized civilian population. To the best of our
knowledge, the sample size of the NHANES III Mortality
Study makes it the largest prospective cohort study of lead
exposure and mortality conducted to date. The large sample
size permitted the investigation of the effect of blood lead in
important subgroups, after adjustment for important con-
founders and potential intermediates, and after exclusion of
patients with a history of cardiovascular disease and cancer at
baseline.
Most importantly, the present study for the first time
permitted the investigation of the association between blood
lead levels below 0.48 mol/L (10 g/dL) and mortality end
points. The association detected provides new evidence of the
adverse impact of lead at levels that are still considered by
many to be acceptable, particularly for adult exposures.30
This association may be surprising to some, but it is important
to place it in an historical context. Current population blood
lead levels are estimated to be substantially higher than blood
lead levels in preindustrialized human societies.31 Although a
10-fold decline in blood lead levels has occurred in the
United States in recent decades, current levels remain orders
of magnitude higher than in preindustrialized times. In the
present study data, the association of blood lead with cardio-
vascular mortality was evident at levels as low as 0.10
mol/L (2 g/dL). Because 38% of US adults had lead levels
0.10 mol/L (2 g/dL) in NHANES 1999 to 2002, the
public health implications of these findings are substantial.
The health effects of current lead levels on adult populations,
however, are not viewed as a pressing public health concern.
The present study, in conjunction with previous data, indi-
cates that this perception may be erroneous and that accept-
able blood lead levels in adults need further investigation.
The results of the present study call for the inclusion of lead
exposure at levels 0.48 mol/L (10 g/dL) among adult-
related cardiovascular risk factors.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
We studied the association between blood lead levels and mortality over 12 years of follow-up in a representative sample
of the US population. We found that blood lead levels as low as 0.10 mol/L (2 g/dL), currently considered safe, were
associated with an increased risk of overall mortality and an increased risk of mortality due to coronary heart disease and
stroke. Blood lead levels were not associated with cancer mortality. Because 38% of US adults had lead levels 0.10
mol/L (2 g/dL) in 1999 to 2002, the public health implications of these findings are substantial. The health effects of
current lead levels on adult populations, however, are not viewed as a pressing public health concern. The present study,
in conjunction with previous data, indicates that this perception may not be justified and that the current regulations for
acceptable blood lead levels in adults are now outdated and may need to be revised. Because of the limited ability the
present study had to evaluate the risks of lead exposure associated with blood lead levels below 0.10 mol/L (2 g/dL),
there is a need for future research to identify the level of lead exposure that is no longer associated with adverse health
outcomes. Although markedly reduced, current blood lead levels may not be low enough; practicable and cost-effective
methods for reducing lead exposure in the general US population are needed. ?? ?? ?? ??
