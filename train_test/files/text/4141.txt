Evidence suggests that the increase in rates of overweight/
obesity is especially rapid among first-year college students
(Lloyd-Richardson, Bailey, Fava, Wing, & The Tobacco
Etiology Research Network, 2009; Wengreen & Moncur,
2009) and that elevated body weight once achieved may per-
sist throughout adulthood (e.g., Gordon-Larsen, Adair,
Nelson, & Popkin, 2004). Consequently, a corresponding
surge in contemporary public health science has sought to
capture the magnitude and determinants of weight gain and
other body composition changes occurring at this develop-
mental juncture (e.g., Vella-Zarb & Elgar, 2009). Although
data generated from an influential quantitative review
revealed that the average weight gain observed during the
first-year transition is considerably less than the popular
notion of the "Freshman 15" (Vella-Zarb & Elgar, 2009), the
weight increase still exceeds rates found in the general popu-
lation (Levitsky, Halbmaier, & Mrdjenovic, 2004).
Nevertheless, stemming the cumulative impact of even small
increases in weight may mitigate risk for cardiometabolic
morbidity in ensuing adulthood.
A major ecological contributor to the heightened vulner-
ability to overconsume and gain weight during the first year
of college appears to be the relatively unlimited access to
highly palatable, calorically dense yet nutritionally deficient
foods (e.g., Levitsky et al., 2004). Indeed, studies have
shown that entering college students consider the easy access
to unhealthy foods served in "all you can eat" on-campus
dining facilities, the close proximity of restaurants serving
low-cost fast food in conjunction with the limited availabil-
ity of healthier food options as key environmental barriers to
optimal weight management (Greaney et al., 2009; Nelson,
Kocos, Lytle, & Perry, 2009). Quantitative evidence further
corroborates these qualitatively derived themes. Levitsky
et al.'s (2004) prospective analysis showed that consuming
evening snacks, high-fat junk foods, and eating meals in "all
you can eat" dining halls accounted for significant variance
in first-year weight gain.
Notably, this phenomenon also extends to students'imme-
diate residential environment. Researchers documented the
presence of an average of more than 22,000 calories worth of

and Food Intake Regulation Among
Ethnically Diverse First-Year Women

Abstract
To evaluate the association between weight gain and psychological dimensions of appetite, a sample of 83 ethnically diverse
first-year undergraduate females had body mass index (BMI) assessed and completed self-report measures of hedonic hunger,
mindfulness, and intuitive eating. Positive associations between mindfulness and intuitive eating and negative links between
intuitive eating and hedonic hunger and BMI were observed over time. BMI gainers experienced a significant decline in
intuitive eating across the first college semester. No significant between-group effects for mindfulness or hedonic hunger
were detected. Preliminary results suggest that changes in internally derived appetite- and consumption-regulating processes
may underlie weight gain during the first-year college transition. Implications for optimizing college health promotion efforts
for young women at this developmental juncture are discussed.

food and beverage items per dorm room in a predominantly
first-year undergraduate sample living on-campus (Nelson &
Story, 2009). Interestingly, some of the unhealthier items dis-
covered were actually procured from the "care packages"
received from home (Nelson & Story, 2009). The constant
media barrage of food and beverage product advertising tar-
geting college-age youth serves as yet another environmental
mechanism that further amplifies perceptions of the omni-
presence and ready availability of a wide array of highly
appetizing food for this at-risk population (Nelson, Story,
Larson, Neumark-Sztainer, & Lytle, 2008).
Nonetheless, it is apparent that not all individuals are
equally susceptible to overeating when exposed to the ines-
capable plethora of tasty albeit mostly unhealthy food
options. The modern conceptualization of hedonic hunger
has emerged to characterize variability in the sensitivity to
the reward properties of highly palatable food present in the
environment (Lowe & Butryn, 2007). Hedonically driven
appetite processes reflect a psychological desire to consume
food for pleasure and represent a salient preoccupation with
food in the absence of true homeostatically driven physio-
logical hunger (Lowe & Butryn, 2007). Scholars further con-
tend that this extrinsically activated dimension of appetite is
promoted by the ambient permissive social norms that
encourage overconsumption in the United States' exces-
sively rich food climate (Lowe & Butryn, 2007). Hedonic
hunger was shown to positively correlate with a range of
maladaptive eating patterns (Finlayson, Cecil, Higgs, Hill, &
Hetherington, 2012; Lowe et al., 2009; Stanton, Garcia, &
Green, 1990) and was elevated among obese relative to non-
obese individuals (Cappelleri et al., 2009). One earlier study
found that college students who reported greater weight fluc-
tuations tended to endorse lower efficacy in being able to
resist the temptation to eat in the presence of palatable food
versus their weight-stable peers (Toray & Cooley, 1997).
Nevertheless, evaluating the contribution of hedonic hunger
to risk for first-year college weight gain specifically is sur-
prisingly underdeveloped in the scientific literature. Results
from a single prospective analysis conducted with first-year
students in the United Kingdom indicated that possessing a
stronger appetitive drive stimulated by the presence of envi-
ronmental food cues was predictive of changes in fat-free
mass during this developmental transition (Finlayson et al.,
2012). Researchers however did not specify whether changes
in hedonic hunger were observed over time in relation to
first-year weight gain status.
Alternatively, individual differences in mindfulness and
intuitive eating may serve as internally derived appetite reg-
ulatory processes that counteract the potent desire to eat in
excess of energy needs in the context of an overabundance
of enticing high-calorie foods present on and in the vicinity
of today's college campuses. Indeed, the construct of mind-
fulness which has its historical roots in ancient Buddhist
contemplative traditions invites individuals to adopt a non-
judgmental awareness to one's present moment experiences
(Kabat-Zinn, 1990). Mindfulness has been studied exten-
sively in Western science in recent decades (Greeson, 2009)
and of relevance to the present investigation has been inno-
vatively integrated into psychological and behavioral inter-
ventions for eating disorders (see Wolever & Best, 2009, for
a review), and for enhancing the regulation of weight and
metabolism (e.g., Daubenmier et al., 2011). Therefore, when
applied to the context of eating mindfulness invokes a dis-
cerning though relaxed awareness of the intricacies of the
entire eating process by cultivating a multisensory engage-
ment of the complex interplay between internal (e.g.,
thoughts, emotions, hunger, and satiety cues; Hepworth,
2011; Kristeller & Wolever, 2011) and external (e.g., the
tastes, textures, aromas, and colors of foods; contextual trig-
gers such as the influence of food advertisements and social
situations involving tempting foods: Framson et al., 2009)
factors that regulate appetite and food intake. Of note,
Grinnell and colleagues were the first to explore the rela-
tionship between mindfulness, weight-related behaviors,
and anthropometric parameters among first-year college
students (Grinnell, Greene, Melanson, Blissmer, & Lofgren,
2011). In the authors' cross-sectional analysis, mindfulness
was negatively associated with emotional eating and exter-
nal eating; less-mindful students exhibited marginally larger
waist circumferences than their more-mindful peers
(Grinnell et al., 2011). Although this research constitutes a
unique contribution to the literature, the prospective associ-
ation between changes in mindfulness and weight gain sta-
tus among first-year college students has not yet been
examined.
Akin to mindful eating, an intuitive eating style is an out-
growth of positive psychology and describes an approach to
food intake that is characterized by the unconditional per-
mission to eat, eating for physiological rather than emotional
reasons, and trusting the wisdom of the body's appetite sig-
nals to guide the process of eating (Tylka, 2006). Studies
have cited positive relationships between intuitive eating and
body appreciation (Augustus-Horvath & Tylka, 2011) as
well as inverse associations with measures of eating pathol-
ogy (Tylka, 2006). Although cross-sectional research has
demonstrated a negative relationship between intuitive eat-
ing and body mass index (BMI) in a college female sample
(Tylka, 2006), it remains to be clarified whether changes in
this adaptive eating orientation are associated with weight
gain status among first-year females specifically.
To address the aforementioned evidentiary gaps, the pri-
mary objectives of the present pilot investigation were (a) to
examine the linear relationships between hedonic hunger,
mindfulness, intuitive eating, and BMI at the beginning of
the fall and spring semesters, and (b) to ascertain whether
baseline levels as well as changes in these externally and
internally mediated appetite and food intake regulating char-
acteristics across the first college semester differed by BMI
gain status in an ethnically diverse sample of first-year
female undergraduates. Based on prior research (e.g.,
Webb et al. 3
Finlayson et al., 2012; Framson et al., 2009; Grinnell et al.,
2011), we anticipated observing positive relationships
between mindfulness and intuitive eating as well as negative
correlations between these variables and BMI and hedonic
hunger irrespective of time of assessment. We further sur-
mised that individuals who experienced an increase in BMI
between the start of the fall and spring semesters would pos-
sess lower mindfulness and intuitive eating scores and con-
versely higher hedonic hunger scores at baseline relative to
those who did not gain weight. Last, we predicted a signifi-
cant decline in adaptive self-regulatory characteristics and an
increase in the urge to eat in the presence of palatable food
over time among weight gainers.
Method
Participants
The analyses reported here were generated from a larger ini-
tial-stage prospective cohort investigation seeking to eluci-
datebiopsychosocialcontributorstomodifiableweight-related
behaviors, weight gain, and other body composition changes
among ethnically diverse first-year college women. In all,
134 first-time first-year female undergraduates (54 Black/
African American [B/AA] and 80 White/European American
[W/EA]; M age = 18.1, SD = 0.29) were recruited at the start
of the fall semester in September (T1) of the year they entered
college. Eighty-three participants (n = 39 B/AA students)
returned to complete a second series of follow-up assess-
ments in January (T2) as the spring semester commenced.
Measures
Demographic questionnaire and body composition measure-
ments. Participants completed a standard demographic ques-
tionnaire at T1 and at both time points had the following
body measurements taken: height, weight, waist and hip cir-
cumference, and percentage of body fat. For the purpose of
the present analysis only BMI is reported here.
Mindfulness.The 12-item Cognitive and Affective Mindful-
ness Scale­Revised (CAMS-R; Feldman, Hayes, Kumar,
Greeson, & Laurenceau, 2006) measures the construct of
mindfulness with specific emphasis given to four domains:
attention, present-focus, awareness, and nonjudgment. Items
include, "I can tolerate emotional pain," and "I am able to
accept the thoughts and feelings I have." Participants are
asked to rate responses on a 4-point Likert-type scale. After
reverse scoring Items 2, 6, and 7, higher scores indicate
greater mindful qualities. The total scale showed acceptable
levels of internal consistency when tested with two separate
college-age samples (Sample 1  = .74; Sample 2  = .77)
during the original series of validation studies. The Cron-
bach's alpha coefficient derived from the present sample
reached adequate levels ( = .71).
Intuitive eating.The 21-item Intuitive Eating Scale (IES;
Tylka, 2006) is a composite measure of the construct assess-
ing attitudes characterized by offering oneself the uncondi-
tional permission to eat, eating for physical versus emotional
reasons, and trusting internal hunger and satiety cues to guide
the eating process. Items include, "I can tell when I'm slightly
full" and "I trust my body to tell me what to eat." Greater
endorsement of an intuitive eating style is indicated by higher
scores. A high level of internal consistency for the total scale
was observed in the original series of validation studies con-
ducted in large samples of college women (s ranged from
.85-.89; Tylka, 2006). The internal consistency documented
in the present sample exceeded adequate limits ( = .77).
Hedonic hunger. The 30-item Situational Appetite Measure­
Urges (SAM-U; Stanton et al., 1990) is one of the two ver-
sions of the Situational Appetite Measure (SAM) that were
created to assess urges to overeat in selected situations
(SAM-U) and self-efficacy in controlling urges to overeat
(Situational Appetite Measures-E; SAM-E). The present
study only used one of the five subscales within the SAM-U.
The 6-item Food Presence subscale was selected as a brief
measure of hedonic hunger. Participants are asked to indicate
whether they feel the urge to eat in specific situations on a
5-point Likert-type scale. Items include, "When I am around
food or food is easily available" and "When I try to eat just a
little of some good food." Higher scores indicate the pres-
ence of a greater desire to eat. Adequate internal consistency
was observed for the Food Presence subscale (females,
 = .78; males,  = .75) among college students in the origi-
nal validation studies. The Cronbach's alpha for the current
sample exceeded acceptable limits ( = .79).
Procedure
Human subjects'approval was obtained from the appropriate
university Institutional Review Board prior to participant
recruitment. Participants provided written informed consent
at the beginning of the fall semester. At both time points,
participants completed a battery of psychosocial question-
naires after which anthropometric measurements were taken
in a semiprivate lab space. At each visit, participants had the
option of receiving either research credit in a participating
Psychology course or a US$20 Visa debit card as an
incentive.
Statistical Analyses
Preliminary descriptive statistics were computed to evaluate
the distributional characteristics of all study variables. These
initial data screening methods supported employing standard
parametric analytic procedures. An alpha level of .05 was
used to determine statistical significance though marginal
trends (i.e., reaching an alpha level between .05 and .10) are
presented to offer beneficial avenues for future research to

ables at baseline, respectively. Pearson's bivariate correla-
tions were computed to evaluate the zero-order relationships
between the primary study variables.Amultivariate repeated-
measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) model was performed to
ascertain whether BMI gain status was associated with
changes in hedonic hunger, mindfulness, and intuitive eating
over time. The Bonferroni correction was used in post hoc
analyses to minimize the occurrence of Type 1 error.
Follow-up one-way ANOVA models and paired t tests were
performed to clarify significant interaction effects. Analyses
reported here were conducted using SPSS version 16.0 sta-
tistical software.
Results
Weight-Related Characteristics Among
Completers
At baseline, 6.0% of completers were categorized as under-
weight, 60.2% were categorized as normal weight, 25.3%
were categorized as overweight, and 8.4% were categorized
as obese. Of the 83 completers, approximately 64% experi-
enced an increase in BMI between T1 and T2. Only 2.5% of
participants gained the "Freshman 15" of 15 pounds or more,
whereas 15.4% of participants gained at least 5 pounds or
more. Roughly 11.1% of the sample gained  5% of their
initial body weight.
BMI Gain Status and Baseline Sociodemographic
and Anthropometric Characteristics
Table 1 presents the baseline sociodemographic and
anthropometric characteristics by BMI gain status. Weight
gain in our sample was not strongly associated with any of
these attributes at baseline. However, marginal associa-
tions were observed between BMI gain status and race/
ethnicity (p = .07), marital status (p = .06), and campus
residential status (p = .09).
Zero-Order Intercorrelations
Table 2 shows all zero-order correlations. Analysis of cor-
relations revealed that mindfulness and intuitive eating were
moderately, positively correlated at T1 and T2 (p < .01).
Mindfulness and BMI were negatively correlated at T2
(p < .01). Medium-sized negative effects were observed
between intuitive eating and hedonic hunger at T1 and T2
(p < .01). Intuitive eating scores were also shown to nega-
tively covary with BMI at T1 (p < .05) and T2 (p < .01).

tion with a significant interaction effect between BMI gain
status and Time, F(3, 75) = 3.18, p = .03, 2 = .11. Univariate
effects indicated a significant relationship for BMI gain status
and mindfulness, F(1, 77) = 4.49, p = .04, 2 = .06, as well as
with intuitive eating, F(1, 77) = 5.02, p = .03, 2 = .06, over
Webb et al. 5
time (see Table 3). One-way ANOVA models further clarified
that students who experienced an increase in BMI reported
marginally higher levels of mindfulness at baseline, F(1, 81)
= 3.51, p = .07, and significantly lower levels of intuitive eat-
ing at T2, F(1, 79) = 5.46, p = .02, relative to nongainers (see
Table 3). Paired t tests denoted a significant decline in intui-
tive eating scores among BMI gainers between the two first-
year assessments, t(51) = 2.97, p < .01 (see Table 3). Notably,
significant effects for hedonic hunger were not detected with
respect to this set of analyses.
Discussion
The first year of college has been targeted as a period of
heightened risk for excess weight gain among emerging
adults and the mere presence of a vast array of highly palat-
able and often unhealthy food options is suggested to exert a
powerful influence on these adverse changes in weight and
body composition. While others have examined psychologi-
cal and behavioral factors that differentiate between those
who do and do not gain weight during the first-year transi-
tion (e.g., Hodge, Jackson, & Sullivan, 1993; Jung, Bray, &
Ginis, 2008; Provencher et al., 2009; Serlachius, Hamer, &
Wardle, 2007), our preliminary investigation was the first to
explore the influence of variables reflecting adaptive dimen-
sions of self-regulating appetite and food intake in this devel-
opmental context. Indeed, somewhat in accordance with
initial predictions we found noteworthy effects for intuitive
eating while statistical trends tentatively point to the utility
of further evaluating individual differences in mindfulness
and/or mindful eating in association with weight gain status
among first-year college women.
Baseline sociodemographic and anthropometric charac-
teristics did not strongly distinguish first-year BMI gainers
from nongainers. Notably, those who experienced an eleva-
tion in BMI across the first college semester were not more
likely to be overweight or obese. This is in contrast to
research which concluded that starting college at a higher
body weight is a risk factor for enhanced first-year weight
gain relative to underweight/normal weight peers (Kasparek,
Corwin, Valois, Sargent, & Morris, 2008; Webb & Hardin,
2012). Yet these previous analyses were based on examining
mean changes in body composition. Conversely, the present
comparisons were not based on stratifying the sample rela-
tive to a predetermined threshold of significant BMI gain,
which may explain why the link to overweight/obesity status
did not emerge.
Regarding the correlational findings, results partially sup-
ported initial hypotheses. Positive associations were observed
between mindfulness and intuitive eating and the latter was
shown to negatively correlate with BMI and hedonic hunger
at both first-year assessments. These effects replicate and
extend earlier research conducted in college (Tylka, 2006)
and community-dwelling female samples (Augustus-
Horvath & Tylka, 2011). Not surprisingly, higher levels of a
constructive approach to appetite and food intake that is
grounded in valuing the inner wisdom of the body (vs. food-
relevant cues in the external environment, negative emo-
tional activation, and/or rigid, internalized food rules), which
prioritizes homeostatically driven eating behavior were
indicative of espousing broader mindful self-regulation char-
acteristics, lower BMIs, and less susceptibility to the pull of
the availability of enticing foods.
Mindfulness however, was only modestly correlated in
the negative direction with BMI at the beginning of the
spring semester, whereas significant linear associations
between hedonic hunger and mindfulness and BMI were not
found. This pattern of results suggests that general mindful
awareness may be more strongly linked with changes in BMI
or specifically with overweight/obesity status (Framson
et al., 2009). Moreover, variation in a mindful eating orienta-
tion could be of greater relevance to consider in relation to
individual differences in the sensitivity to the reward proper-
ties of highly palatable foods present in the surrounding
environment (Framson et al., 2009). It is also plausible that
effects for hedonic hunger would have emerged in a larger
sample with greater inclusion of young women with elevated
body weights and/or dietary restraint as is suggested by pre-
vious research (Cappelleri et al., 2009; Stanton et al., 1990).
Our prediction that first-year women who possessed
higher BMIs at the start of the spring semester versus the
beginning of the fall semester would have entered college
with lower levels of mindfulness and intuitive eating in con-
junction with higher levels of hedonic hunger was not con-
firmed. In fact, BMI gainers reported a marginally higher
level of mindfulness qualities at baseline though the validity
of this finding is somewhat tenuous given the limited statisti-
cal power of the analysis. Collectively, these largely null
results could stem from categorizing participants on a crude

absolute increase in BMI rather than based on exceeding per-
centile cutoffs at extremes of the distribution for BMI gain
(e.g., Wengreen & Moncur, 2009). Furthermore, recent work
by Provencher and colleagues proffers the usefulness of
accounting for individual differences in baseline scores on
risk factors for eating disorders (e.g., dietary restraint) as a
contributor to delineating weight gain status (Provencher
et al., 2009). Thus, markers of greater disturbed (vs. adap-
tive) eating processes may be more indicative of baseline
vulnerability for first-year weight gain. Alternatively, per-
haps significantly higher scores on mindfulness (or mindful
eating) and intuitive eating and lower levels of hedonic hun-
ger at the outset of college are more predictive of enhanced
weight maintenance and/or weight loss among first-year col-
lege women. Replicating our analyses in a larger sample and
further classifying nongainers in this manner which is more
closely aligned with the analytic approach cited in previous
work (Hodge et al., 1993; Provencher et al., 2009; Serlachius
et al., 2007) might lend support to this speculation.
However, we did find partial support for the hypothesized
association between BMI gain status and changes in extrinsi-
cally and intrinsically mediated appetite and food regulatory
characteristics during the first-year transition. More specifi-
cally, students who experienced an increase in BMI between
the two assessments showed a significant decline in intuitive
eating scores and on average reported engaging in intuitive
eating to a lesser extent at the beginning of the spring semes-
ter than nongainers. The aforementioned statistical trend
indicating marginally higher mindfulness scores at baseline
among BMI gainers yet comparable means at the second
time point in comparison with nongainers tentatively implies
a potential reduction in this self-regulatory attribute, the
presence of which could be more reliably detected in a larger
and higher powered participant sample.
We also cannot rule out the possibility that individual dif-
ferences in intuitive eating processes are sensitive to the
naturally occurring changes that transpire in the early college
adjustment period (Dyson & Renk, 2006; Nelson et al., 2008)
as well as a result of engaging in a targeted behavioral
intervention (Bacon, Stern, Van Loan, & Keim, 2005; Cole
& Horacek, 2010; Young, 2011) among individuals spanning
a diverse range of body weights and eating patterns. However,
robust changes in arguably more stable appetite and food
intake regulating qualities such as mindfulness and hedonic
hunger may not emerge outside of the context of more
focused and intensive psychological treatments for individu-
als with clinically significant levels of excess weight (e.g.,
Daubenmier et al., 2011) and/or eating pathology (e.g.,
Carter, McIntosh, Joyce, Frampton, & Bulik, 2006). Further
disentangling these relationships certainly merits future
scholarly attention.
These novel albeit preliminary findings should be inter-
preted cautiously in light of the following caveats. First, our
modest-sized, exclusively female sample precludes general-
izing results to male first-year students. Second, due to a siz-
able attrition rate analyses were underpowered to potentially
detect a stronger moderating effect for mindfulness. Third,
evaluating the contribution of hedonic hunger within this
body of research would be further refined by incorporating a
measure such as the Power of Food Scale (Lowe et al., 2009)
that provides even broader coverage of the construct. Other
suggestions for future analyses include exploring the pres-
ence of alternative moderators of shifts in these psychologi-
cal appetite-regulating qualities in concert with weight gain
status such as current dieting status/level of dietary restraint,
race/ethnicity, and BMI status at college entry. Subsequent
efforts would also benefit from elucidating whether declines
in mindfulness and intuitive eating in fact mediate weight
gain and changes in other markers reflecting heightened car-
diometabolic risk (e.g., percentage of body fat, waist circum-
ference, waist-to-hip ratio, etc.) among first-year college
women.
In conclusion, the general urge to eat when highly palat-
able food is available in the environment (without consider-
ing elevations in dietary restraint and/or body weight
concurrently) may not be a robust vulnerability factor associ-
ated with weight gain during the first-year college transition.
Alternatively, declines in factors associated with an

internally generated self-regulatory style specifically within
the context of eating and perhaps more generally may con-
tribute to first-year weight gain. College health promotion
efforts aiming to enhance mindful acceptance and intuitive
eating skills (e.g., Gow, Trace, & Mazzeo, 2010) may hold
promise in counteracting the powerful influence of internal
(e.g., negative emotions, food-relevant cognitions) and
external (e.g., the omnipresence of highly appealing food)
factors on appetite, food intake, and in turn weight during the
early college transition period.
