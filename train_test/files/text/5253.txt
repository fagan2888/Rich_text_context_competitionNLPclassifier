Introduction
The fascination that I hold for cross-cultural communication
emanates from a moment of distress that I experienced when
on a linguistic stay in Britain. While I was waiting for a
friend at a clothing store, a British woman stopped me and
said, "You look very beautiful in pink!" This utterance might
sound simple but, for me it was confusing and problematic.
The answer in my mind was, "What does she want?" But I
did not reply. She went on and added, "I like the way you
dress." What I thought about at that moment was that her
utterance was an indirect question about the place from
which I bought my clothes as it was very common in a
Tunisian context to say, "I like your outfit; where did you get
it from?" However, for fear that this would not be the appro-
priate response, I remained silent and perplexed. The woman
then left with a strange look on her face and kept turning
behind looking my way as she made her way outside. I felt
so embarrassed and I remember even trying to avoid
encounters and possible interactions with native speakers
(NSs). The puzzling question, however, was, "Why, in spite
of my ability to utter grammatically correct sentences, was I
unable to communicate effectively with a NS?"
When engaging in conversations with NSs syntactic accu-
racy alone does not guarantee an effective communication
for a nonnative speaker (NNS). Trosborg (1995) claimed,
"No error of grammar can make a speaker seem so incompe-
tent, so inappropriate, so foreign, as the kind of trouble a
learner gets into when he or she does not understand or oth-
erwise disregards a language's rules of use." (p. 3). In fact,
such errors are often evaluated as signs of impoliteness on
the part of second or foreign language users involved
(Barron, 2003). Even advanced learners can face difficulties
when attempting to interpret NSs' intentions. Indeed, NNSs,
who may understand only the literal meaning of words, can
experience cross-cultural pragmatic failure.
Pragmatic failure is defined as, "the inability to under-
stand what is meant by what is said" (Thomas, 1983). To put
it differently, pragmatic failure is the inability to interpret
utterances the way the speaker intends them. In fact, prag-
matic failure can generate frustration, misunderstandings,
and cross-cultural communication breakdowns (Wolfson,
1989). This article is based on acknowledging that people
from different cultural backgrounds may behave differently
and that perceptual differences can make communication
between members of different cultures challenging (Wolfson,
1981). The compliment response (CR) speech act is selected
given the fact that compliments may occur at almost any
point within a speech event (Wolfson & Manes, 1980). This

Who Is Responsible for Successful
Communication?: Investigating Compliment
Responses in Cross-Cultural Communication
Asma Moalla1
Abstract
This article attempts to compare aspects of discourse and sociolinguistic competence among speakers of American
English (AE) and Tunisian learners of English with regard to the communicative act of compliment response (CR). The
two participant groups' CR strategies were found to be cross-culturally different and were found to be dependent on
the participants' respective cultural backgrounds. In addition, the data collected emphasize the fact that cross-cultural
communication is a transactional mutual process and that both native and nonnative speakers of English are equally
required to adjust their communicative behaviors to develop intercultural communication. The 30 American students and
30 Tunisian students filled a Discourse Completion Test (DCT) with 8 contextualized situations and sat after that for a
semistructured interview. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed for analysis.

frequency is not the same across the world, and as a result,
interlocutors can find difficulties responding to compliments
in intercultural conversations.
The present article aims at accomplishing two major
goals. First, it examines the CR strategies used by speakers
of American English (AE) and Tunisian learners of English.
Second, it explores the reasons behind the way the two
participant groups respond to compliments. Following
the examination of these two goals, the researcher hopes to
propose ways to facilitate communication between the two
groups based on the assumption that communication is
transactional and that it is not the responsibility of one party
to be aware of cross-cultural differences and to make adjust-
ments to successfully communicate with the other.
Pragmatics Across cultures
This research is grounded in three main fields, namely,
contrastive pragmatics, cross-cultural pragmatics (CCP),
and interlanguage pragmatics (ILP). Contrastive pragmat-
ics' major principle is to make a particular language the
object of study and then compare its linguistic realizations
to other languages (Riley, 1981). It investigates how com-
municative functions are realized in different languages.
Wierzbicka (1991), however, suggested that people from
different cultures speak differently not because they have
different linguistic codes, but because these linguistic codes
are used differently. In other words, people from different
cultures speak differently because of the influence of some
cultural norms that are reflected in speech acts. The field
CCP, thus, has developed out of the field contrastive prag-
matics. The ideas of the field of CCP can be summarized as
follows: People in different countries speak differently and
their different ways of speaking can be accounted for in
terms of independently different cultural norms. To put it
differently, the way people from different cultures produce
and perceive speech acts is determined by the underlying
cultural norms and values. Investigations of pragmatics
across cultures have led to the question of how language
learners identify, perceive, and produce a particular speech
act in a second or foreign language, hence, the field ILP.
ILP is defined as "the investigation of NNSs' comprehen-
sion and production of speech acts, and the acquisition
of L2-related speech act knowledge" (Kasper & Dahl, 1991,
p. 215). It focuses on how learners realize speech acts and
demonstrates that even advanced learners can fail to convey
or comprehend intended meanings (Thomas, 1983).
UniversalityVersus Culture Specificity
The conceptualization and production of speech acts is not
identical across cultures and languages and the strategies
used to perform a particular speech act are not governed by
determined universal principles. Austin (1962), Searle
(1975) and Brown and Levinson (1978) suggested that the
conceptualization and realization of a specific linguistic
behavior was identical across cultures and languages and
that the strategies used to perform a particular speech act
were governed by determined universal principles. Fraser,
Rintell, and Walters (1980) expressed the view that "Every
language makes available the same set of strategies--
semantic formulas--for performing a given speech act"
(p. 79) suggesting that people in different cultures used the
same strategies in performing speech acts. In other words,
culture may not have an impact on the way speech acts are
performed. A similar belief is displayed by Clark and Shunk
(1980) on the production of the speech act requesting "when
people make requests, they tend to make them indirectly.
They generally avoid imperatives like tell me the time"
(Clark & Shunk, 1980, p. 111).
Although the studies mentioned above were conducted
only on English speakers' performance of speech acts, the
findings were, for ill or for good, extrapolated to all cultures
and languages. Clark and Shunk's use of the adverb "gener-
ally" implies that because English people do not use the
imperatives in their requests, people in the entire world are
expected to do the same. Indeed, the universalistic stance pro-
jected by authors like the ones mentioned above was rejected
by Wierzbicka (1985) who contended that the universality of
speech acts was a mere illusion and that researchers who
thought that speech acts were governed by universal mecha-
nisms seemed to "take it for granted that what seems to hold
for the speakers of English must hold for people generally" (p.
145). Wierzbicka (1985) discussed a number of differences
between Australian English and Polish in the production of
different speech acts. She gave the example of a Polish woman
who greeted an English visitor using the imperative "Mrs.
Vennisa! Please! Sit! Sit!" (p. 147).
Wierzbicka (1985) then noted that the use of the impera-
tive made the utterance, when heard by a NS of English,
sound like a command to a dog because English people
would avoid the use of the imperative and substitute it with
interrogative forms like "will you sit down?" (p. 147). The
conceptualization and production of speech acts are, there-
fore, not universal but determined by the specific cultural
norms embedded in each society. When studies compare the
performance of speech acts of two different cultures, strate-
gies used to perform a certain speech act seem to differ.
Accordingly, the present study on the CRs of speakers of AE
and Tunisian learners of English is a culture-specific study
as it compares the speech act CRs in two different cultures.
CRs
A CR is a "verbal acknowledgement that the recipient of
the compliment heard and reacted to it" (Nelson, Al-Batal,
& Echoles, 1996, p. 413). CRs have been referred to as
adjacency pairs, action chain events (Pomerantz, 1978),
interchanges (Herbert, 1990), and sequences (Wolfson,
1989). These different expressions evolve around the idea
Moalla 3
that the compliment event is a two-unit turn in which
Utterance 1 and Utterance 2 are linked by both temporal and
relevancy conditions (B is conditionally relevant and sequen-
tially dependent on A).
A. That's a beautiful sweater.
B. Thanks, my sister made it for me (Herbert, 1990,
p. 201).
The earliest study on American CRs was written by
Pomerantz (1978). She collected compliments as naturally
occurring by speakers of AE in different situations.
Pomerantz claimed that speakers of AE face two conflicting
conditions when responding to compliments:
A. Agreeing with the speaker
B. Avoiding self-praise
She observes that compliments have the function of
"supportive actions" (Pomerantz, 1978, p. 82) and that, as a
result, their preferred next action is accepting the compli-
ment. However, this first constraint conflicts with another
constraint, which is that of self-praise avoidance. In other
words, the complimentee tries to avoid praising himself or
herself by not agreeing with the complimenter because
agreeing strategies may lead the complimenter to criticizing
the complimentee's response. Wolfson and Manes (1980),
in their turn, studied the CR behavior of speakers of AE and
claimed that one function of CRs was that of negotiating
solidarity. For Wolfson and Manes, the solution lies in
downgrading the compliment and referring the compliment
to another person or to another characteristic of the object.
This allows receivers to mitigate the compliment without
disagreeing with the speaker and without praising them-
selves. Farghal and Haggan (2006) studied the CRs of 79
Kuwaiti Bilingual students. The study showed instances of
grammatically inaccurate and pragmatically inappropriate
utterances. Grammatically inaccurate responses accounted
for 45.3% in compliments and 20.7% in responses, while
pragmatically inappropriate utterances accounted for 13%
in compliments and 21% in responses. The high percentage
of inaccurate utterances in responses implies that NNSs
experienced pragmatic failure in responding to compli-
ments more than in paying compliments. Al-Falasi (2007)
conducted a research on Emirati and American CRs. She
divided her participants into three groups: Ten NS of AE, 10
Emirati NNSs of English, and 10 Emirati nonspeakers of
English. She used a Discourse Completion Test (DCT) and
interviews as data elicitation methods and based her clas-
sification of responses on Herbert's (1990) taxonomy. The
six scenarios in the DCT were on food, a good essay, nice
skirt, nice clock, and a nice shirt (a compliment given by a
friend and a stranger). Although the three groups showed
similarities in the use of acceptance strategies, NNSs of
English and nonnative nonspeakers of English brought
some L1 expressions. Expressions like "really!" "swear!"
were frequently used by Emirati participants. Such expres-
sions can be interpreted on the face of it, as questioning the
sincerity of the compliment, but the interview data revealed
that the Emirati participants just wanted to receive another
compliment. In addition, on being complimented by her
teacher, the complimentee responds by "I'm ashamed,"
which was an expression borrowed from Arabic. The study
on Emirati and American CRs shows that, although the two
groups opted for acceptance strategies, the Emirati responses
proved to be borrowed from their mother tongue.
Method
Participants
The basic design of this research article concentrated on two
groups of participants. The first group was composed of 30
speakers of AE, half of whom were females and half males.
Their ages ranged between 18 and 28 years. Most were
undergraduate students at Kennesaw State University and
The Catholic College in Atlanta, Georgia; others were
enrolled at different colleges in the surrounding areas of
Atlanta, Georgia. The number of participants was deter-
mined according to Kasper and Dahl's (1991) recommenda-
tions that in a cross-cultural study, each group should
contain approximately 30 participants to obtain a representa-
tive sample.
The second group was composed of 30 Tunisian learners
of English comprising 17 females and 13 males. All were
3rd- and 4th-year students at the English Department of the
Faculty of Arts and Humanities in Sfax, Tunisia. It was
assumed that 3rd- and 4th-year students majoring in English
were proficient enough in English to be able to understand
the situations and respond to them in English and express
their ideas and the rationale behind their choices of CR strat-
egies in English. Participants' ages ranged between 21 and
28. The type of sampling used in this study was that of con-
venience; that is to say, participants from the 3rd- and 4th-
year English who were available for the research qualified
for participation. Confidentiality measures were taken to
maintain students' privacy.
A consent form was distributed before starting the
research. Students were informed about the instruments that
would be used in the research, the aim of the research, and
the timing. They were asked to sign two copies, keep one
with them, and give the other to the researcher.
Research Instruments
The data elicitation methods used in this study are the DCT
and the semistructured interview. DCTs are questionnaires
that contain a set of briefly described situations designed to
elicit a particular speech act (Billmyer & Varghese, 2000).
The Open-Item Free Response format was used. This means
4 SAGE Open
that no predesigned options were given to participants.
Rather, participants were asked to write down whatever
responses they thought were appropriate. They were pro-
vided with much space in which they could include their
responses as well as any comment or nonverbal response.
They were also told in the instructions that if they would say
nothing in a particular situation, they should write "I would
keep silent."
The situational prompts designed for the DCT of the
present study were built to reflect in as much as possible
realistic situations and situational variations. To obtain real-
istic situations, the frequency of occurrences of the topics of
compliments and the degree of participants' familiarity with
the situations were taken into consideration. The choice of
topics in the present DCT was based on the findings of pre-
vious studies that showed that topics of compliments
focused mainly on appearance and ability, while few com-
pliments were given on possession and personal traits.
Wolfson (1983) advanced that, "with respect to topic, com-
pliments fall into two major categories: those having to do
with appearance and those which comment on ability" (p.
90). In her study of CRs, Holmes (1988) found that among
517 compliments, 92% were about appearance, ability/per-
formance, and possessions. Thus, the eight situations were
distributed along the four topics according to the frequency
of occurrences of each topic as found in previous research
on American CRs. In fact, selecting situations that fall into
one of the most frequent topics used among speakers of AE
can capture a relatively full picture of compliments. The
situational prompts used in the present study were also
based on cultural familiarity, that is, on whether participants
were familiar with the context in which the situations took
place or not. The degree of familiarity was guaranteed by
referring to other DCTs on CRs, and to a pilot test that was
conducted prior to the administration of the DCT. The situ-
ations were as much as possible varied in terms of gender,
social status, and closeness.
The second data elicitation method used in this study was
the semistructured interview. Semistructured interviews aim
at understanding the reasons behind the use of a particular
CR strategy. First, demographical questions were asked
including the age and level of students. The students were
then asked to account for the use of each response. The inter-
view was conducted in English for the two groups of
participants.
Procedures
The DCT administered to speakers of AE took place in the
United States at Kennesaw State University and at the
Catholic College in Atlanta, Georgia. For the Tunisian
English learners, the elicitation was conducted in Sfax,
Tunisia,attheUniversityofArtsandHumanities.Participants
were asked to respond to eight contextualized situations in
the way they would respond if they really encountered those
situations. Immediately after responding to the DCTprompts,
the 30 American and 30 Tunisian students were asked to sit
for an interview and justify the use of their responses in each
situation. A tape recorder was used so that the researcher
could concentrate fully on the interview. Participants were
induced to talk about what prompted them to produce a par-
ticular response in a particular situation, how they inter-
preted the compliment in each situation, and what factors in
the situation made them respond in a particular way. During
the interview, the researcher was careful not to interrupt the
participants and to induce them to talk about their own expe-
riences in responding to compliments to have as much infor-
mation as possible. Participants were tested individually to
maintain confidentiality and because it was impossible to
have two people fill in the DCT and sit for the interview at
the same time. The time devoted to each student was 30 min:
15 min for the DCT and 15 min for the interview.
Coding Scheme
This section identifies the framework under which the data
coming from the DCT were classified. The coding scheme
is based mainly on previous classifications of the speech act
CRs in empirical research. Herbert's (1988, 1990) classifi-
cation of CRs is selected because it presents a general clas-
sification of CRs. However, the major strategies were
divided into five instead of three (as in Herbert's classifica-
tion) because the request interpretation and no-response
strategies can be major strategies themselves. For the sake
of the readability of the article, some terms used by previ-
ous researchers were replaced by simpler terms. The new
terms have the same meaning as the replaced ones, but they
may be too complicated for some readers to understand. For
example, the strategy "appreciation token" was replaced by
"thanking," "deflecting informative comments" was
replaced by "explaining," and "praise upgrade" was
replaced by "agreeing." As proposed by Herbert (1986,
1988, 1990) CRs were classified into five main strategies
(accepting, mitigating, rejecting, request interpretation, and
no-response). These strategies were used because all the
responses given by the American and the Tunisian partici-
pants fit in one of these strategies. Substrategies, however,
were modified according to participants' responses. For
example, the expressing gratitude and expressing gladness
strategies were added to the classification used in this study
because they existed in the participants' responses. In addi-
tion, the expressing embarrassment responses and the
invoking strategies were added because they occurred in the
Tunisian responses. As for the strategy "mitigating," the
"encouraging" strategy was added because it was used
by the Tunisian participants while the "joking" strategy
was added because it existed in the CRs of both groups
(Table 1).

Results and Discussion
CR Strategies Used by theTwo Participant Groups
Results from the DCTs showed that the most frequently used
strategy among the American participants was accepting.
They also indicate that CRs can be placed between accepting
the compliment (59%) and mitigating it (36%). Table 2
below describes the frequency occurrences of the CR strate-
gies used by speakers of AE.
Table 2 showed that the most frequently used strategies
among speakers of AE were the accepting and mitigating
strategies while the rejecting and request interpretation
strategies accounted for 1% and 4%, respectively. Looking
at the table vertically, we can see that the acceptance strat-
egy was the most frequently used strategy in five out of the
eight situations (53% for Situation 2 [S2], 83% for S4, 80%
for S6, 83% for S7, and 77% for S8). However, opting for
mitigating strategies showed that the American participants
tended to denigrate the praiseworthiness of the object of
compliment. Opting for mitigating responses was frequent
across the situations (36%) and in each situation as well.
Table 2 shows that in three situations, the mitigating strat-
egy scored higher than the other strategies (67% in S1, 57%
in S3, and 63% in S5).
The interview data confirm the DCT findings. Out of 30
American participants, 20 reported that accepting the com-
pliment was the best way to respond to compliments because
it was the way they had been raised, while 10 Americans
reported to have problems in responding to compliments.
This means that they have to find something to say to meet
the social expectations. A plausible explanation for the ten-
dency among speakers of AE to use the accepting strategy is
their tendency to adhere to Leech's (1983) Agreement
Maxim (minimize disagreement between self and other;
maximize agreement between self and other).
According to the DCT data, the American participants
tended to make comparatively greater effort to agree with the
complimenter by accepting compliments (Pomerantz, 1978).
In fact, the high frequency of the acceptance strategy has
been underscored by other researchers of the CR behavior of
speakers of AE. The percentages of accepting strategies have
ranged between 50% and 66% in Nelson et al. (1996), Chen
(1993), and Herbert (1988). Nelson et al. (1996) found that
50% of American participants used the accepting strategy.
Chen (1993) found that 58% of American participants
used this strategy and Herbert (1988) found that 66% of the
American participants used this strategy. These researchers
claimed that accepting the compliment was the most expected
second turn.
However, the percentage of mitigating responses used by
the American participants in this study can also be consid-
ered high (36%). Leech's (1983) Modesty Maxim (minimize
praising of self, maximize dispraise of self) explains the
responses of the American participants in the study. By using
mitigating strategies, according to this explanation, the com-
plimentee mitigates the force of the compliment without dis-
agreeing with the complimenter and without praising himself
or herself, and so he or she may find solution to the dilemma
claimed by Pomerantz (1978) whereby the complimentee
should respond to the compliment in a polite and supportive
manner while avoiding self-praise.
In addition, the data showed that the American partici-
pants explained the use of certain CRs by stating that they
were common and expected expressions. The data indicated
that responses to compliments might be ritualistic in nature
reminding of Wolfson's (1989) "formulaic speech routines"
(p. 155), which she used to mean formulaic expressions
shared between members of the same speech community
within a given culture. Wolfson and Manes (1980) have
pointed out that producing formulaic expressions as
responses to compliments contributes to establishing friendly
relationships between interlocutors.
As for the Tunisian participants, the results reported indi-
cate that they tended to accept compliments (55%) much
more readily than to mitigate them (33%). Table 3 summa-
rizes the frequency distribution of the CR strategies used by
Tunisian learners of English. Accepting and mitigating strat-
egies were the most frequently used strategies while the
rejecting strategy accounted for 8% and the request interpre-
tation and no-response strategies accounted for 2% each.
This tendency to accept compliments (55%) indicates that
the Tunisian participants are directed toward accepting the
praiseworthiness of the compliment. Employing the reject-
ing strategy, however, is considered as an instance of adher-
ing to the Modesty Maxim (minimize praise of self, maximize
dispraise of self). This means that the Tunisian participants
seemed not to have in their schema that damage can be done

to the complimenter due to their rejection of the compliment.
They rejected the compliment as a way of showing modesty
and believed that this response was expected by everyone.
The high percentage of this type of strategies matches the
findings of research on Arab CRs. Nelson et al. (1996), for
instance, found that acceptance strategies accounted for 67%

among Syrian students and Farghal and Al-Khatib (2001)
found a higher percentage reaching 83.85% among Kuwaiti
students. More recently, Farghal and Haggan (2006) recorded
a similarly high percentage, 73.53% among Jordanian stu-
dents. Nelson et al. (1996) explained the frequent use of
acceptance strategies by Syrian NNSs of English by a ten-
dency to establish friendly relationships with the compli-
menter, whereas Farghal and Haggan explained this tendency
to accept compliments by a preference on the part of
Jordanian students to use positive politeness strategies.
Conversely, the rejecting CR strategy accounted for 8%
as recorded in the data coming from the DCTs of the
Tunisian participants in this study. Thus, this strategy was
not used by participants in the earlier mentioned studies on
Arab CRs. Farghal and Haggan (2006), for example, did not
find any rejections among Kuwaiti students and attributed
the absence of rejecting CR strategies to a tendency among
Kuwaiti students to adopt positive politeness and, thus, to
give more weight to preserving the complimenter's positive
face. They even went as far as to claim that attending to the
complimenter's positive face was a general feature of Arab
CRs. This conclusion, however, may not be applicable to
the Tunisian English learners participating in this study
because using rejecting strategies is considered an instance
of adhering to the Modesty Maxim as they explained, which
means that the complimentee tries to attend to his or her
own positive face so that his or her behavior can be regarded
as polite and not to save the complimenter's positive face.
In fact, the DCT data revealed that rejecting strategies
were used in 7 out of the 8 situations in the Tunisian data.
Moreover, 20 Tunisian participants opted for rejecting strate-
gies and 10 of them reported that they disagreed with the
complimenter to show modesty and appear as behaving
appropriately. The CR strategies used by the two participant
groups proved to be embedded in their respective cultural
backgrounds. The impact of culture on the participant's CR
strategies is further confirmed by the students' explanations
of their own CR strategies in the interviews.
The Impact of Culture on the Participants' CRs
The results showed that the location of compliments may
have an influence on the two groups' CRs. In the interview
data, 17 out of the 30 Tunisian participants reported that they
did not expect the compliment to be given at the beginning
of the conversation. Their explanations revealed that the
normal way of talking to a friend, in their experiences, was
by greeting him or her and not by giving a compliment. In
American culture, compliments about appearance were
more likely to be given at the beginning of the conversation.
The findings showed that giving a compliment at the begin-
ning of a conversation serves as a conversation starter for the
American participants. Furthermore, data obtained from the
Tunisian participants show that in the cooking (S3) and
smart clothes (S6) situations, utterances were not interpreted
as compliments but as points of view (see the appendix).
This explains why in those situations, 20 Tunisian students
interpreted the utterance as insincere and, accordingly, used
the joking, no-response, and disagreeing strategies. These
results showed that the Tunisian students seemed more
interested in assessing the truthfulness of the content of the
language than in its social function. In other words, if the
complimentee believed in the truthfulness of the compli-
ment and of its assertion, she or he would accept it. If not,
she or he would reject the compliment or question its truth
value. In their attempts to define the word compliment, the
Tunisian students resorted to its translation in Arabic, which
means that the way they defined a compliment reflected
an idealized perception of their own language in use. This
may imply that a compliment by definition includes
untruthful information as far as the Tunisian participants are
concerned.
In fact, the Tunisian students included words in the inter-
views which were taken from standard Arabic such as moje-
malah (compliment) and ramyi worood (flattering) to explain
the pragmatic rules that governed their perceptions and inter-
pretations of compliments. These words imply that the
Tunisian students perceived an attempt to compliment as just
doing face work and that the utterance was not sincere. This
leads to the conclusion that the Tunisian participants may
have behaved according to what Lord (1996) called "frank-
ness to a fault" (p. 50), which means that the complimentee
will accept the compliment only if she or he believes in its
truthfulness. Otherwise, she or he may disagree or criticize
the complimenter for not telling the truth. This finding
matches that of Golato (2002), who studied the CR behavior
of 27 Germans in dinner-table and telephone conversations.
She claimed that Germans did not engage in complimenting
behavior to do face work, but only if they believed that what
had been said was a compliment, then they were engaging in
complimenting behavior. The impact of culture on the CRs
of the two groups was also clear in the force toward which
victory was directed. The results showed that the words used
among the American participants to respond to compliments
about the tennis game situation revolved around effort, hard
work, improvement, and practice, while the Tunisian partici-
pants used lexis related to both effort and natural talent.
Literature on American CRs showed that, in the content
area of skill, the American participants tended to redirect
achievement and victory to the result of a particular action
rather than to the talent of the participant. This is because
natural talent in Western cultures is considered an excep-
tional attribute and referring to it as the result of one's
achievement may be socially unaccepted (Lorenzo-Dus,
2001; Wolfson, 1989). Because the area of work and skill
contains both talents and hard work (Wolfson & Manes,
1980), the Tunisian participants feel that both areas should
be emphasized. Another culture-specific finding emerges
from the two groups' perceptions of the compliment about
smart clothes (S6). In the Tunisian context, formal dress is
8 SAGE Open
required in business-related receptions, and so, when a party
is organized, guests are required to attend to the expected
conventional behavior--which is to dress up. For the
Tunisian participants, in such a party one should be dressed
formally whereas for the American participants, employees
have the option of dressing semiformally and the invitation
is expected to indicate a formal dress code if one is in place.
In addition, some contextual variables have influenced
the CR behavior of the two groups. For example, in S7, mis-
sion accomplished, the contextual variables closeness, age,
and specificity of the event carry different weight in the
responses of the two groups. Whereas American responses
are more influenced by the age of the complimenter and the
specificity of the event, Tunisian responses are influenced by
Arab-Muslim values in connection to treatment of relatives,
whoever they may be. This explains why the social variable
closeness proves to be more important than that of age.
Gender also affects the two participant groups' percep-
tions of the particular compliment about eyes. The analysis
showed that the American and Tunisian females participat-
ing in this study tended to describe compliments about eyes
as sincere or insincere (in terms of truthfulness), whereas
the American and Tunisian males tended to describe com-
pliments about eyes as innocent or not innocent (innocent as
opposed to flirtatious). The data revealed that 9 American
female participants reported that a compliment about eyes
was more sincere when it was offered by a female rather
than by a male whereas 10 female Tunisian participants
reported that this type of compliment was more sincere
when it was offered by a male rather than by a female.
Female American participants thought that it was unusual
that a female complimented a female on her eyes, especially
when they were of the same age.
As for Tunisian female participants, 10 reported that a
compliment from a male was both more sincere and more
common. These 10 Tunisian female participants also
reported that females were envious and they gave compli-
ments about appearance to bring evil to other females. The
perception of compliments about eyes among the American
and Tunisian participants' males was also different. As for
male participants, the results showed that while 10American
male participants reported that a compliment from a female
on eyes was innocent, only 4 Tunisian male participants
reported that it was innocent. For American male partici-
pants, compliments about eyes could be common in
American society and it could be taken as a way to open a
conversation with the complimentee. Tunisian male partici-
pants, however, reported that a compliment from a woman
about eyes could not be innocent even when coming from an
elderly woman.
The results have also shown that there are four CR strate-
gies which were used by the Tunisian participants but did not
feature in the American data. These strategies are the invok-
ing, encouraging, expressing embarrassment, and no-response
strategy. The use of the invoking strategy is a clear instance of
transfer from the Tunisian culture as whishing good health for
elderly people is very common in a Tunisian context. The
Tunisian participants may have resorted to their background
cultural schema by using the invoking strategy. The express-
ing embarrassment strategy used by Tunisian participants is
seen as a self-denigrating strategy (Chen, 1993). In other
words, the complimentee lowers himself or herself by verbal-
izing his or her embarrassment. The absence of this strategy
in the American data may be explained by the fact that the
American participants do not want to think poorly of them-
selves. In a study of Emirati CR behavior, Al-Falasi (2007)
found out that the expressing embarrassment strategy was
used by Emirati female students and argued that the use of the
expression "I am embarrassed" may strike a NS as out of
place and that this expression would be more appropriate
when an offense is committed.
The encouraging and no-response strategies can also be
considered as culture-specific strategies, as they were used
only by the Tunisian participants. The use of the encouraging
strategy may be explained by an attempt to downplay the
compliment and not to make the complimenter feel bad
about himself or herself. The use of the no-response strategy,
however, indicates that the complimentee may not have
interpreted the utterance as a compliment, and this explains
why she or he preferred not to respond.
The cultural impact was also clear in the negative reac-
tions the two groups had toward responses which were dif-
ferent from theirs. The interview data showed that 20 of the
American participants reported that the use of rejecting
responses was rude and impolite because disagreeing with
the complimenter implied that she or he was not able to
make judgments or that his or her opinion did not matter. A
negative evaluation was also used by the Tunisian partici-
pants on the structure of the compliment in S8 (beautiful
eyes). They thought that the sentence "Has anyone ever told
you that you have beautiful eyes? They are so nice and big"
needed to be softened by including a word such as tbarkal-
lah (blessed be God) so that the complimentee would not
say that the complimenter was envious. Including softening
words in compliments was necessary for the Tunisian stu-
dents because they believed that these words would protect
them from the evil eye. In other words, according to the
Tunisian students, complimenting them on their big beauti-
ful eyes could do harms to their eyes. In fact, one Tunisian
student reported that she was once complimented on her
beautiful eyes without including a softening word and on
the following day her eyes swelled and reddened.
Likewise, 18 of the American participants reported that
agreeing with the complimenter would be considered a sign
of arrogance; the Tunisian participants employed the agree-
ing strategy in 25 of their responses. Therefore, it can be
claimed that each group tended to evaluate the different
behavior from its own perception of pragmatic rules. In all,
12 of the American participants explained that they would
not expect the complimentee to compliment them back on
Moalla 9
their eyes, on their being good writers or good cooks because
they would think that she or he was just saying that to be
polite and that it was kind of hypocrisy to tell someone that
his or her eyes were nice too if they were not.
In contrast, the Tunisian participants evaluated certain
responses which were different from theirs as instances of
hypocrisy and artificiality. Nine students implied in their
comments that Tunisians do not give compliments frequently
especially to strangers and that if someone was known as a
person who gave a lot of compliments, she or he would be
known as a hypocrite, or people would tell others not to
believe him or her as this was what she or he would tell
everyone regardless of the situation.
The results discussed above revealed that the CR strate-
gies used are deeply entrenched in the participants' own cul-
tural values. They have also shown that two participant
groups are not aware of cultural differences in responding to
compliments and this explains their negative evaluations to
CR strategies that were different from theirs. In the next sec-
tion, we try to propose ways to facilitate cross-cultural
communication.
Ways of Facilitate Cross-Cultural Communication
Ned (1996) stated that on engaging in a conversation with
someone from another culture, one might get the impres-
sion that the other person is rude, or stupid, or cold. But
instead of stopping at this negative observation, one could
use the negative reaction as a signal that one might be in a
situation in which there were cultural differences in what
was considered an appropriate behavior. Moreover, solving
intercultural difficulties should be cooperative, with the aim
of stopping the attribution of differences to negative evalu-
ations. Adler and Rodman (2003) suggested that one step
toward successful intercultural communication was having
the skill of "perception checking." They defined this skill as
a cooperative approach to communication that helped us
understand others accurately instead of assuming that our
first interpretation was correct and that the other person was
misbehaving. Instead of jumping to conclusions about other
people's thoughts, the perception checking skill may help
control negative evaluations. A complete perception check
has three parts; a description of the behavior that is thought
to be different, a possible interpretation of the behavior, and
a request for clarification about how to interpret the behav-
ior. Based on the topic of the present article, a perception
check for the negative evaluations of the American and the
Tunisian participants would look like this:
E.g., you did not respond to my compliments (behavior),
I wonder if you did not hear me (first interpretation), or if
there is something wrong with it (second interpretation),
why did you do that? (request clarification)
E.g., you told me that my suit looks nice (behav-
ior), I can't tell whether you are kidding me or if you
are serious (interpretation), how do you really feel?
(request clarification)
By doing so, the complimenter and the complimentee
may negotiate areas of differences without assuming
that the other person is wrong. This solution can solve pos-
sible miscommunication and lead to successful intercul-
tural communication.
This article calls for an attempt at solving cross-cultural
communication that is mutual and not confined to just
one party. To put it differently, it is not the responsibility of
just one group to abide by the cultural norms of the other
group to maintain a successful communication. Behaving
differently does not mean that this behavior is wrong and
visiting another country does not mean that the visitor has to
abide by the cultural norms of that country. Explaining
and negotiating cultural differences may be the solution for
successful cross-cultural communication.
Implications and Contributions to CCP and
ILP Research
The findings of this study underscore the importance of tak-
ing into consideration the pragmatic aspects of language. To
increase interlocutors' awareness of cross-cultural differ-
ences, some methods and teaching techniques need to spill-
over into pragmatics. For example, teachers can use
presentations and discussion techniques. Teachers can give a
presentation on the CR behavior of people from different
countries and ask their students to respond and discuss it
together. This activity can draw students' attention to the CR
strategies used to respond to compliments in other cultures.
Moreover, teachers can ask students to practice with paying
compliments and responding to them the way they thought
appropriate and then have them watch a sequence of a movie
including exchanges of compliments and CRs given in
another culture. Students can in pairs or in groups take notes
and compare CR in different cultures to their own responses.
The purpose of this activity is to alert students to the fact that
people in different countries respond differently to compli-
ments and that certain responses can be face threatening or not
conducive to sustaining conversation. This article contributes
to an understanding of why and how communication may
breakdown between the American and the Tunisian partici-
pants. Analyzing the instances of cross-cultural differences
may help interlocutors avoid slipping unconsciously into
wrong judgments and react negatively to cultural differences.
Conclusion
The aim of this study was to investigate the CR behavior of
speakers of AE and Tunisian English learners. The results
reveal several cross-cultural similarities and differences
between the two groups. The American as well as the
Tunisian participants tend to accept compliments much
more than mitigate them. The results have also teased out
10 SAGE Open
some cross-cultural differences between the two groups in
responding to compliments. A major difference is in the
functions CRs serve in the two societies. First, the two
groups prove to have different perceptions on when a com-
pliment about appearance should be said. Whereas the
American participants tend to give compliments at the
beginning of the conversation as part of the greeting
exchange, the Tunisian students think that a conversation
should start with greeting the other person by asking about
his or her health and not by giving a compliment.
Moreover, the results show that the two groups tend to
redirect the force of the compliment about achievement to
different sources. Whereas speakers of AE tend to redirect
the praise force to the result of a particular action, namely,
hard work, Tunisian English learners tend to redirect the
achievement to both hard work and natural talent. The data
discussed showed that the two participant groups' CRs are
embedded in their own cultural backgrounds.
For example, the analysis of the CR strategies used by the
two groups has shown that the perception of a compliment
about eyes is different across genders. For American female
participants, a compliment is believed to be more sincere
when offered by a female whereas, for responses coming
from Tunisian females, it is perceived to be more sincere
when offered by a male. As for American male participants,
it is common to receive a compliment about eyes from a
woman; whereas for Tunisian male participants, a compli-
ment about eyes given by a woman was believed to have
other implications. The analysis and discussion of gender
perception across cultures show that the two participant
groups' CR strategies are perceived and interpreted within
the framework of their own language in use.
In conclusion, the CR behavior of the American and the
Tunisian participants has several cross-cultural similarities
and differences. The two groups' responses seem to be
dependent on their respective cultural backgrounds.
The discussion of the results also shows that cross-
cultural differences between the American and the Tunisian
participants can be divided into two sets. Some cross-cul-
tural differences may sound strange or different for the com-
plimenter, but may not lead to communication breakdown.
Starting the conversation with a compliment, although
unusual and unexpected for the Tunisian participants, may
not make communication with the American participants
challenging. Also, the use of the invoking strategy by the
Tunisian students may sound different, but American par-
ticipants may not decide not to engage in a conversation
with a Tunisian participant just because she or he wishes
him or her good things. However, some cross-cultural dif-
ferences may be problematic. Differences which result in
misunderstandings or in which the compliment is taken as
an offense or a sign of rudeness, hypocrisy, or arrogance
may lead to communication conflicts. The use of disagree-
ing or no-response strategies on the part of the Tunisian
participants can make communication challenging.
Moreover, giving a compliment about appearance without
including a softening expression can be considered rude for
the Tunisian participants, and therefore, they may choose to
ignore the compliment.
The different perceptions the two groups have about how
to interpret and produce a response may make communica-
tion between them challenging. People from different cul-
tures, therefore, may need to be more open to cross-cultural
differences in order not to jump to wrong conclusions about
people who behave differently and hence contribute in devel-
oping a mutual relational intercultural communication. My
experience in the United Kingdom, for example, would have
been positively evaluated if I had been aware that a simple
smile or "thank you" would have transformed the interaction
into a successful exchange.
