Objective. To determine whether efficient allocation of home care services can produce net long-term care cost
savings.
Methods. Hazard function analysis and nonlinear mathematical programming.
Results. Optimal allocation of home care services resulted in a 10% net reduction in overall long-term care costs for
the frail older population served by the National Long-Term Care (Channeling) Demonstration, in contrast to the 12%
net cost increase produced by the demonstration intervention itself.
Discussion. Our findings suggest that the long-sought goal of overall cost-neutrality or even cost-savings through reduc-
ing nursing home use sufficiently to more than offset home care costs is technically feasible, but requires tighter targeting
of services and a more medically oriented service mix than major home care demonstrations have implemented to date.
THE issue of whether the actual and potential perfor-
mance of home care services can offset nursing home
use, and thereby reduce overall long-term care costs for
chronically impaired older persons, has been a central con-
cern of policy analysts for nearly two decades. Despite a con-
siderable body of empirical data provided by a number of
major demonstration studies, understanding of the issue re-
mains incomplete. In part, this is because analysis has been
hindered by conceptual and methodological approaches that
are limited in their ability to address key policy issues, partic-
ularly those related to service-targeting and allocational effi-
ciency. The broad objective of the research described in this
article is to apply a more rigorous and informative analytical
framework within which these issues can be addressed. Our
goal is to assess the actual performance against the estimated
optimal performance of the National Long-Term Care
Demonstration (better known as the Channeling Demonstra-
tion)--and, by inference, the performance of other such pro-
grams--in the cost-effective use of long-term care services.
In this way we can estimate the extent to which the Channel-
ing Demonstration may have fallen short of its cost-contain-
ment potential and gain insight into reasons why.
The question of whether home-based long-term care ser-
vices can serve as cost-effective alternatives to nursing
home care for frail older persons is important both because
it has major implications for the design and financing of
long-term care services at a time when demand for them is
expected to rise dramatically, and because the ability to
maintain frail older persons in community settings, rather
than in institutions, is an important humanitarian issue in
United States social policy. The fact that an expansion of
home care services is at the core of the Clinton Administra-
tion's proposals for long-term care reform lends additional
interest to the issue.
It is widely believed that a series of demonstration stud-
ies undertaken over the past 20 years, culminating in the
1984 Channeling Demonstration, has definitively estab-
lished that home care services have little or no potential to
reduce overall long-term care expenditures, even in very
frail populations. As a consequence of these findings, schol-
arly policy interest in such services in this context has
waned greatly in recent years, despite continuing political
support for home care programs. In our view, however, re-
ports of the demise of the cost-effective home care alterna-
tive are premature and are based on conceptual models and
data analyses that are inconclusive and incomplete with re-
spect to a number of key policy issues.
The more systematic and rigorous studies of the effects
of home care on nursing home use and long-term care costs
have been large experimental or quasi-experimental studies
in which a treatment group is provided with supplemental
home care services over their predemonstration levels
while a control group is not. After a period of time, the
cost-equivalent of the difference in total nursing home use
across treatment and control groups over the period is
netted out against the total costs of the demonstration ser-
vices to ascertain whether total long-term care costs have
decreased, in which case the intervention would be consid-
ered "cost-effective" in this narrow, but important, sense.
In some cases, changes in acute care costs are considered
as well. In general, the more rigorous evaluation studies
have found insufficient nursing home savings to offset the
costs associated with the demonstrations' services (Hughes,
1985; Kemper, Applebaum, & Harrigan, 1987; Weissert,
Cready, & Pawelak, 1988). This finding was repeated in the
results of the Channeling Demonstration--the largest, most
broadly implemented, and most rigorously evaluated home
care demonstration to date (Kemper, 1988).

COST SAVINGS THROUGH HOME CARE S229
Despite the general uniformity of the body of findings
from these demonstrations, what is known about the effect
of home care services on nursing home use and long-term
care costs remains remarkably limited and offers little guid-
ance on such key issues as appropriate service mixes and
targeting of services. One principal shortcoming of the evi-
dence is that the demonstration intervention has been
viewed as an aggregate "package" in the evaluation meth-
odology, which in effect compares average outcomes across
treatment and control groups. As a result, the differential ef-
fects of particular services for particular individuals have
not been assessed fully in the evaluations.
As we have pointed out previously (Greene, Lovely, &
Ondrich, 1993), findings that home care interventions are
not cost-effective at the program level implies only that, on
average, the costs of providing the home care services out-
weighed the imputed savings in nursing home expenditures.
But this average loss may disguise any number of individ-
ual gains. That is, it is possible that some, perhaps many,
individuals who received demonstration services experi-
enced a sufficient reduction in their actual or expected nurs-
ing home use to offset the costs of the home care services
they consumed. Indeed, we have argued that this appears to
be the case for many individuals in the Channeling Demon-
stration population (Greene et al., 1993). It is also possible
that different portfolios of home care services could have
been more cost-effective for individuals than those that
were actually utilized. These issues have seldom been
addressed rigorously in the literature, though they are fun-
damental to considerations of the efficient targeting of
services (cf. Davidson, Moscovice, & McCaffrey, 1989;
Miller, 1987).
Targeting, properly understood, is systematically decid-
ing who gets which services, when, and in what amounts
(Greene et al., 1993). Even if a screening process is effec-
tive in identifying those individuals who could benefit from
services (in ways defined by the goals of the program), the
effectiveness and cost performance of the intervention still
depends on the appropriate services being provided in ap-
propriate amounts to the appropriate individuals. The in-
tended contribution of the research reported here is to ad-
dress these issues directly. We consider the targeting issue
specifically, analyzing service use in the population tar-
geted by the Channeling Demonstration at the level of spe-
cific individuals using specific home care services in spe-
cific amounts at specific prices. We then make use of this
framework to assess the potential of home care services to
offset their long-term care costs through reductions in ex-
pected nursing home use.
In our earlier work on optimal home care service al-
location, technical considerations required us to allow the
optimization to allocate all available home care services,
including those provided outside of the Channeling Dem-
onstration from both public and private sources (see Greene,
Lovely, Ondrich, & Miller, 1995). Most importantly, the
optimization was allowed to reduce services to individ-
uals where it found them to be used inefficiently, even, in
effect, taxing away services that were purchased privately.
Although the results of this rather authoritarian "social
planning" solution are of analytical value, their direct pol-
icy interest is obviously quite limited. In the present study,
we have been able to constrain the optimization process
effectively so that, like the Channeling Demonstration, it
can initiate or supplement home care services where it finds
it appropriate to do so, but it cannot reduce nondemonstra-
tion services already in use. Thus, the optimization here
faces the same basic structural constraints, prices, service
types, and population characteristics as did the actual
demonstration, so that its performance in effect yields a
technically optimal "gold standard" against which the cost-
containment performance of the actual demonstration can
be compared.
METHODS
Our work proceeds in two basic stages. The first devel-
ops an empirically estimable statistical model for long-term
care costs that takes into account both the costs of home
care services and those of nursing home care; these costs
are expressed as a function of individual characteristics and
levels of use of various home care services. The second
stage is to use this model to simulate a cost-minimizing dis-
tribution of services to a population statistically equivalent
to the one served by the Channeling intervention, and to
compare this optimal outcome to the one actually achieved
by the demonstration. Through this comparison, as noted,
we can assess the actual performance of the Channeling
Demonstration relative to its estimated theoretical potential.
Further, by comparing actual service assignments as imple-
mented in the demonstration with those assigned by the op-
timization, we can gain insight into the sources of any dif-
ferences in performance.
Developing the Cost Equation
Drawing from our earlier work on this topic (Greene et
al., 1993), we begin our analysis by inquiring as to what ex-
actly is meant when one asks whether providing an addi-
tional unit of a specific home care service to an individual
is "cost-effective." Consider first the effect of providing an
additional unit of this service (e.g., one hour per week) on
the expected cost of caring for this individual in the com-
munity. The extra service not only increases the nominal
weekly cost of care by the hourly cost (price) of the service,
it also increases the probability that this cost will actually
be incurred insofar as the additional unit of service in-
creases the likelihood that the individual will be able to re-
main in the community. On the other hand, these additional
costs will be offset insofar as the additional unit of service
decreases the likelihood that the nominal weekly charges of
a nursing home will be incurred. The question of budgetary
cost-effectiveness then hinges on whether, and the extent to
which, the second effect exceeds the first. It should be
noted that this analysis generalizes to individuals who
might currently be in nursing homes in that the availability
of an additional unit of home care service may be taken to
affect the risk for nursing home use in subsequent periods
by increasing the likelihood of discharge and decreasing
that of readmission.
We will make our discussion more precise by consider-
ing an individual whose characteristics are such that her
overall risk (probability) of being found in a nursing home,
S230 GREENE ETAL
conditional on survival, is ty. This may, equivalently, be
thought of as the proportion of time such an individual
would be expected to spend in nursing home care. Assume
further, for the moment, that surviving individuals are ei-
ther in the community or in a nursing home (we deal with
the issue of hospital use later). We can then write the total
expected (i.e., long-run average) weekly long-term care
costs for this individual as
T=tyN+(l -\\t) C (1)
where N is the prevailing nominal weekly charge for nurs-
ing home care and C is the sum of the price-weighted quan-
tities of all formal home care services that would be con-
sumed by this individual during a week of community
residence. Equation 1 therefore simply expresses the nomi-
nal cost of each state weighted by its probability of occur-
rence, which is the conventional method of estimating costs
in situations where outcomes are not known with certainty
at the time decisions must be made (Raiffa, 1970).
If this individual receives some amount of additional
home care services, the anticipated result is to decrease i|i
(nursing home risk) to some degree, but to increase C by
the nominal cost of these additional services. Observe in
Equation 1 that these effects tend to counteract each other
in that the term \\tN will decline while the term (1 - iff) C
will increase. Whether it is cost-effective to provide these
additional home care services is determined by the net ef-
fect on expected total weekly long-term care cost (7). If T
decreases, the reduction in risk (I|J) was sufficient to offset
the increase in C and the additional services may be said to
be cost-effective in this sense. On the other hand, if T in-
creases, then the additional services have failed to reduce
nursing home risk sufficiently to offset the expected costs
of their provision.
It is instructive to consider Equation 1 in marginal form.
The continuous (rate of) change in expected total costs as a
function of changes in the level (weekly hours) of the jth
community service (5,) is obtained by differentiating par-
tially with respect to Sj to yield
TTT + PU) · (1 - (2)
where P(j) is the per-hour cost (price) of the jth service
[dC/dSj = P(j)]. For an additional unit of service to be cost-
effective, it is necessary for the derivative on the left to be
negative; that is, the change in total cost must be downward.
From Equation 2, it is clear that whether it is cost-effec-
tive to provide or make available another unit of home care
service to an individual depends, at a minimum, simultane-
ously on four considerations:
1. The current cost differential between caring for the in-
dividual in a nursing home as compared to the com-
munity: the term (N-Q.
2. The current level of nursing home risk: ij/.
3. The magnitude of the effect on this risk of providing
the additional unit of service: d\\i/dSj.
4. The price of the additional unit of service: P(j).
Empirical Estimation of the Cost Equation
To understand more fully the stochastic model underlying
the cost equation, consider a sample member who begins
heryth stay in a nursing home at calendar time T,. If, at cal-
endar time ij + t, the sample member is still in the nursing
home, then the current duration of her stay is t. In this study
we assume that T, and t are measured continuously. In actual
fact, we have daily information on nursing home use, so our
assumption of continuous measurement is not unreasonable.
We are interested first in examining the determinants of
the instantaneous (conditional) probability of returning to
the community from a nursing home, written as Qn
dt, where
dt is a time infinitesimal and 0n
is the nursing home hazard
rate. Typically, the nursing home hazard rate is determined
by factors at calendar time T> + t and at current duration t.
Thus, we may write
en
= t,t). (3)
The nursing home hazard rate can be defined formally as
the following transformation of a conditional probability
for random completed stay duration 7}:
0n
(T, + t,t) = lim Prob(t<Tj<t+ AHT,, 7}>0/Af. (4)
We consider nursing home hazard rates having a Weibull
form:
0n
(T; + t,t) = p,ar', a > 0, (5)
where pn
, the scale function of the Weibull hazard rate, de-
pends on T; +1 and is typically defined by
pn
= exp{ (3o + P' Znx + p 2Z.2 (T, + 0}, (6)
where Zn is a vector of (weakly) exogenous covariates that are
constant over the individual's history and Zn
i is a vector of
(weakly) exogenous covariates that vary over the course of an
individual's history. The parameter a is the shape or duration
dependence parameter of the Weibull. The goal is to determine
Po, Pi, P2, and a using maximum likelihood estimation. (A
technical discussion of the estimation of this hazard and others
in this section, omitted here due to length considerations, is
available from the corresponding author upon request.)
The hazard rate for entering a nursing home from the com-
munity, 9c, is given an exponential form in this study. An ex-
ponential hazard rate does not depend on current duration
and is simply a Weibull hazard rate with the shape parameter
a = 1. This is a simplifying assumption, but it is necessary if
an individual who is in the community at the start of the sam-
ple period is not to have her initial current community spell
duration assigned arbitrarily. This is not a problem with the
nursing home hazard estimation because there is a sufficient
number of completed nursing home spells with which to es-
timate the hazard parameters after initial half-spells are
omitted from the estimation. In the exponential community
spell model, using the information in the last "half of the
initial community spell as if it were a spell starting at the be-
ginning of the sample history does not lead to biases.
Accordingly, the exponential hazard rate for the commu-
nity spell is determined solely by the Weibull scale function
and can be written
0C
(T, + t) = exp{70 + 7' Zc\ + iiZd (T;
+ t)}. (7)
Equation 7 represents the rate at which individuals move to
COST SAVINGS THROUGH HOME CARE S231
a nursing home. The parameters to be estimated are y0
, yi,
and y2
.
Hazard parameters will be biased in maximum likelihood
estimation if variables have been omitted from the correct
specification of the Weibull scale function, even if the
omitted variables are uncorrelated with those that are in-
cluded. The shape parameter a will typically be biased
downward. Lancaster (1979) proposed a correction for
omitted variables using a random effect technique: A ran-
dom effect v is introduced into the likelihood contribution
of each individual and then integrated out over its probabil-
ity distribution, which was assumed to be unit-mean
Gamma. In our model, this effect represents unobserved
heterogeneity arising from the fact that available measures
of functional status and other covariates are unlikely to ac-
count fully for risk differentials across individuals.
Heckman and Singer (1984) showed that biases could
still result if the assumption about the probability distribu-
tion for the random effect is incorrect, and they proposed a
nonparametric maximum likelihood methodology that pro-
vides consistent estimates of the hazard parameters. The
Heckman-Singer approach posits K classes of individuals,
each with its own scale function intercept. The nursing
home hazard scale function for an individual in class k is
P«*(T, + 0 = exp {po* + P' Zn
, + $'£,,! (T, +1)}. (8)
The parameters to be estimated are Pi, p2
, ex, the (Vs and
K probabilities /?*, where pk
is the probability that the indi-
vidual is in class k. In determining the number of classes
to use (K) we have followed the procedure of Trussel and
Richards (1985), which resulted in two classes for the re-
ported model. (Because attempting to control for unob-
served heterogeneity introduces the problem of defining a
starting time for the sample of community spells, informa-
tion unavailable in the data files, we did not attempt the
Heckman-Singer approach for the community hazard.)
The central issue in the estimation of T in Equation 1 is
the parametrization of i); in a manner that permits its esti-
mation from the data. The other elements of Equation 1 are
obtained directly from the Channeling Demonstration eval-
uation data files (these are the prices of nursing home and
home care services that prevail at the individual's site of
residence and the usage levels of these services as reported
in the surveys).
Parametrization of i|i is accomplished by defining the
hazard functions for the entry of individuals into nursing
homes and for their exits to the community as a function of
their home care service use as well as other relevant fixed
and time-varying characteristics (such as gender and degree
of functional disability, respectively). Because we are inter-
ested in the transition of living individuals between care
settings, the hazards are conditional on survival.
In the community hazard the corresponding mean dura-
tion for a community spell (i.e., the mean length of periods
spent in the community) is

stayers," the scale of the nursing home hazard rate is

where Zm and Z«2
are vectors of time-invariant and time-
varying covariates, respectively, for the nursing home haz-
ard. For "long-stayers," the scale of the nursing home haz-
ard rate is
pn2

The key parameter in Equation 1, \\t, which can be
thought of as an individual's probability of being in nursing
home care, or equivalently as the expected proportion of
her time spent in a nursing home, can now be written as
|Xc)] (14)
In the hazard for nursing home spells (i.e., the hazard of
moving from a nursing home to the community), we incor-
where pt
is the probability of being a short-stayer and p2
is
the probability of being a long-stayer. This expression now
gives \\i as a function of the parameters of the hazard func-
tions, which can in turn be estimated consistently from the
observations.
A total of 4,158 individuals who participated in the
Channeling Demonstration provided information for at
least one of the two hazard analyses: 684 people provided
information for the nursing home hazard analyses; they had
a total of 767 stays, 323 of which were completed over the
sampling frame. Stays that had already started at the begin-
ning of the sampling time frame, of which there were 25,
were dropped from our analyses. A total of 4,109 individu-
als provided information for the community hazard analy-
sis; they had a total of 4,422 spells, of which 766 were
completed over the sampling frame. The portion of an ini-
tial community spell that was covered by the sampling
frame was included in the community hazard analysis.
Nursing home spells interrupted only by short hospital
stays (< 30 days) are treated as single spells.
The Optimization Analysis
Having obtained estimates of the hazard functions' coef-
ficients and expressing \\t as a function of the hazard model
covariates (including home care utilization), we are in a po-
sition to treat Equation 1 as an objective function to be
minimized in terms of home care service levels. The basic
optimization problem to be solved here is this: for each in-
dividual, provide additional quantities (weekly hours) of
each type of home care service (in this study: home nurs-
ing, home health aide, personal care aide, and housekeep-
ing) in such a manner that the expected total long-term care
S232 GREENE ETAL.
cost (Equation 1) for that individual is minimized. Observe
that by minimizing cost for each individual, total aggregate
cost is minimized as well (that is, the optimization problem
is "decomposable" in that it contains no global or cross-
individual constraints). Hence the optimization result pro-
vides information on both optimal service use and expendi-
tures for each individual, as well as an optimal budget and
optimal overall service mix for the target population.
The objective function for the optimization is Equation 1,
solved for each individual. The objective function relates the
optimization criterion (expected individual long-term care
costs) to a set of "control variables" (formal home care ser-
vice levels), which are taken to be determined by a rational
decision maker (the optimization algorithm) that acts as a
cost-minimizing "case manager," so to speak. These are in-
corporated in the i|/< through the estimated hazard functions.
Formally, the optimization problem can be written:
For each individual i = 1 , . . . , n
Minimize T, = I|J,W + (1 - i|i/)G[by assigning the Sv
] (15)
Where G = (16)

Here, / indexes individuals in the Channeling Demonstra-
tion control group, which was the target for the simulated
additional services. We used the control group because
it is essentially statistically equivalent to the treatment
group prior to the intervention. Equation 15, as noted, is the
objective function to be minimized. N is the prevailing (ob-
served average) weekly nursing home charge at the resi-
dence site of individual /. Equation 16 defines C, as the
price-weighted sum of hours of home care services (&,)
where ; indexes service category. That is, C, measures the
monthly nominal home care service expenditures for indi-
vidual /. Equation 17 simply notes that i|;,- is a function of
individual services use (S.,) and a vector of individual char-
acteristics (Xi), via the coefficients from the hazard models.
Inequality 18 limits solutions to ones in which the simula-
tion can only provide services in addition to those actually
found in use prior to the demonstration. Because the rela-
tionship of iji, to Syis nonlinear, Expressions 15 through 18
define a nonlinear optimization problem to be solved sepa-
rately for each individual.
The constraint given by Expression 18 merits further
comment. It requires the optimization to seek only solu-
tions that do not reduce existing preintervention services.
The optimization can (but need not) supplement existing
services or initiate them where none are in use, but cannot
reduce services even where it finds them to be in excess of
efficient levels. The purpose of this restriction is to con-
strain the optimization in the same way that the Channeling
intervention itself was constrained in seeking its goals; that
is, to supplement services at the margin of existing use
prior to the demonstration intervention, but not to seek to
reduce services already in use (Carcagno & Kemper, 1988).
For simplicity of development and notation, we have left
out of this account the problem that the factor (1 - i|;,) rep-
resents the probability of being in any survival state other
than nursing home care, including being in the hospital. Be-
cause individuals are not actually using home care services
while hospitalized, the term (1 - i|i/)G would tend to over-
state expected home care service costs. In the empirical
analyses, (1 - i|/,) has been adjusted for hospital use in the
same manner as we have described previously in this jour-
nal (Greene et al., 1995). We solved the resource allocation
optimization problem using the IMSL nonlinear program-
ming solver.
Data
Data are from the public use files of the Channeling
Demonstration (Carcagno & Kemper, 1988). These remain,
unfortunately, by far the best data available for fine-grained
longitudinal long-term care service use information for a
large, reasonably representative sample of frail older peo-
ple. The demonstration primarily sought to determine
whether the provision of additional home care services
would reduce nursing home use, and thereby overall long-
term care costs, in a frail older population.
The Channeling Demonstration study sample was a tar-
geted group of 6,326 individuals from 10 U.S. sites repre-
senting considerable geographic and socioeconomic diver-
sity (the sites were Baltimore; Houston; Cleveland; Miami;
Philadelphia; an eight-county region in Eastern Kentucky; a
two-county region in Southern Maine; Middlesex County,
New Jersey; Rensselaer County, New York; and Greater
Lynn, Massachusetts). The demonstration enrolled persons
who were relatively old, frail, and with modest or low in-
come. Persons who applied for its programs were screened
to be age 65 or older, substantially impaired in functional
capacity, and to have some degree of unmet need in impor-
tant functional areas. Those participants enrolled while in
nursing home care were further required to be deemed good
prospects for discharge within 90 days.
Those screened into the demonstration were randomly
assigned to either a control group, for whom no interven-
tion was provided through the demonstration, or to one of
two treatment conditions: "basic" and "financial control."
Those at the basic sites were offered case management as-
sistance in obtaining and using existing, nondemonstration
services, but no funds to purchase additional services were
provided. At the financial control sites, however, case man-
agers had the authority to purchase additional home care
services for treatment of group members.
We are interested in comparing the cost-containment per-
formance of our optimization model (which is permitted to
allocate new supplemental resources where it finds they can
sufficiently reduce expected nursing home use) to that of
the Channeling Demonstration's financial control interven-
tion, which, as noted, was likewise permitted to purchase
supplemental services where case managers judged them to
be justified in terms of the project's objectives. These ob-
jectives were intended to include reduction of nursing home
use and consequent overall long-term care cost containment
as a primary goal.
Of the 6,326 persons initially enrolled in the Channeling
Demonstration, 4,158 had complete nursing home use his-
tories over their survival period within the demonstration's
COST SAVINGS THROUGH HOME CARE S233
first 12 months of operation and were used in this study (al-
though half of the survivors at 12 months were followed for
an additional 6 months, the absence of consistent measure-
ment on some data during this period led us to exclude
these latter observations). We used these 4,158 individuals
in estimating our hazard coefficients, and then used the sub-
set of 1,517 individuals in the demonstration's randomized
control groups as our target population for the optimization
analysis. In this way, we make use of all available informa-
tion to estimate marginal effects, but provide simulated
supplemental services through the optimization to a popula-
tion essentially the same in its characteristics as the one ini-
tially encountered and targeted for supplemental services
by the demonstration intervention itself.
Hazard-Model Specification and Measurement Issues
Covariates included in the hazard models, which are
specified symmetrically, include indicator variables for
being African American, Hispanic American, male, or a
homeowner; living alone; being severely impaired or worse
in activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of
daily living (IADL), and cognition; using a wheelchair; and
whether the individual was a treatment group member at ei-
ther a basic or financial control site in the Channeling
Demonstration. Continuous or ordered categorical covari-
ates include age (in years), area nursing home bed supply
(measured in beds per 1,000 population age 65 and older),
monthly income, self-perceived health (on a scale of 1 to 4,
where 1 = excellent, 4 = poor), and number of surviving
children. Finally, and most central to our interest, are mea-
sures of weekly hours of use of the major categories of
home care services provided by the demonstration: home
nursing service, home health aide service, personal care
aide service, and housekeeper service. Means and standard
deviations for these covariates can be found in Table 1.
Of these covariates, the home care services levels and
functional impairment in ADL and IADL were time varying
(measured at the 6- and 12-month survey intervals of the
demonstration) and are incorporated as time-varying co-
variates in our hazard models. Inconsistencies in the survey
over time in measuring cognitive impairment required us to
keep this variable fixed at its baseline value.
As noted, impairment and health-related variables in-
clude dummy indicators of whether each individual was
severely impaired in ADL, IADL, or cognition, or if she
used a wheelchair. In the surveys, functional status in ADL
and IADL was measured in several areas (eating, transfer,
dressing, bathing, and toileting for ADL; meal preparation,
housework, shopping, travel, medication use, money man-
agement, and telephone use for IADL). In each area of
functioning, respondents were scored from 0 to 2, with 0
indicating severe impairment (complete dependence), 1 in-
dicating moderate impairment (needs some help), and 2 in-
dicating independence. For the IADL dummy variable used
here, these scores were summed, and individuals with total
scores between 0 and 3 (the most impaired third of the sam-
ple) were coded 1; the others were coded 0. For ADL, the
range 0 to 2 was coded to 1, producing a similar split.
Cognitive impairment was assessed by the Simple Port-
able Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ; see Pfeiffer,

1975). Individuals getting 5 or fewer of the 10 SPMSQ items
correct were coded 1 on the constructed dummy variable for
severe cognitive impairment; the others were coded 0.
Site- and demonstration-related variables included the
nursing home bed supply in the client site of residence
(beds per thousand population over age 65), whether the in-
dividual was in the demonstration treatment or control
group, and whether treatment group members were in basic
or financial control demonstration sites (these were, as
noted, the two different intervention modes for the Chan-
neling Demonstration). The nursing home bed rate, as a
proxy for bed availability, was expected to positively influ-
ence nursing home use.
The home care service variables consist of survey esti-
mates (measured in hours per week) of formal community
services received by each individual in the sample. We
measured four categories of community service: home
nursing, home health aides, personal care aides, and house-
keepers. These represent the vast majority (over 90%) of
the total in-home services reported to be actually consumed
by the sample. Other categories (e.g., physical therapy)
were not used with sufficient frequency to permit reliable
statistical estimation of their effects.
In the hazard models, services are entered interacted with
those client impairment indicators that were expected to be
substantial predictors of differential impact for that service
on nursing home risk. Thus wheelchair use, often correlated
in an older population with severe frailty and more medical
needs, is interacted with nursing hours. Severe cognitive
impairment seemed likely to be best dealt with by staff with
S234 GREENE ETAL.
training at least equivalent to that of nursing home patient
care aides to whom home health aides are generally compa-
rable; hence the interaction between cognitive impairment
and home health aide service. A similar rationale applies for
personal care aides, who deal primarily with ADL deficits,
and for housekeepers, who deal mainly with aspects of
IADL limitation. The interaction terms are entered symmet-
rically for both the presence and absence of severe func-
tional limitation, except for the interaction of the absence of
severe cognitive impairment with home health aide hours
and the absence of severe ADL limitations with personal
care aide hours. The inclusion of these two terms intro-
duced collinearity effects into the sampling stability of the
other coefficients (mainly because few individuals actually
used more than one type of service over a given period)
without themselves being statistically significant. Hence,
they were dropped from the estimation. Obviously, with
multiple services that may be interactive, both among
themselves (where use levels of one service may influence
the marginal impact of another) and with other client char-
acteristics than those which we included, more elaborate
specifications, as noted, are possible and reasonable. But
our experience with these specifications using the Channel-
ing Demonstration data was that collinearity problems in
their estimation became so prevalent that it seems likely
that experimental rather than observational studies will be
necessary to pursue these more complex specifications.
Information on formally supplied services in the Chan-
neling data set is drawn from surveys administered at base-
line and again at the sixth month and twelfth month of the
demonstration. Both the timing and the measurement pro-
cedures for these services introduce complications and
potentially significant limitations in the data. The survey in-
strument used retrospective questioning that required par-
ticipants to recall the total hours and types of services re-
ceived from all formal sources during the previous week of
community residence. Because of the retrospective nature
of the questioning, it was necessary for our purposes (as
well as for the Channeling Demonstration's original evalua-
tion) to assume that the "snapshot" of service hours re-
ported at the time of the 6-month survey is representative of
the actual hours received in Months 1 through 6. Similarly,
information reported at the 12-month survey is imputed to
Months 7 through 12. See Corson, Granneman, Holden, &
Thornton (1986, Appendix B) for a fuller discussion of the
measurement and typology of home care service used in the
Channeling Demonstration.
An individual in a nursing home at a point in time is not
consuming community services. What is at issue in predict-
ing her transition to the community is what services are
available to her in the community at that time. We do not
have direct measures of such "potential" services. For indi-
viduals who exited nursing homes during the study period,
we took the services they were found to be receiving at the
next survey point (after exit) to be representative of what
was available to them during the preceding period of insti-
tutionalization. For individuals in the sample who began
the study period in nursing homes and did not exit alive, we
have (of course) no data on community service use during
the study period (such individuals represent about 25% of
those initially in nursing homes--about 2% of the sample
overall). For these persons, their baseline report of home
care service use (as reported by them or by their survey
proxy) at the time of their most recent nursing home admis-
sion was used as an estimate for services available. Individ-
uals who had been in a nursing home more than two
months at baseline, and for whom survey recall error by
themselves or by their proxy respondents was thus likely to
be excessive, were excluded from the analysis.
For cost data, site-specific average costs experienced by
the 20% subsample for whom provider record extracts were
obtained were used to estimate the community service and
nursing home prices faced by individuals at that site (see
Thornton, Dunston, & Kemper, 1988). The hourly cost (in
1982 dollars) of home nursing over the 10 sites varied from
$29 to $72, with a mean of $48; home health aide hourly
costs ranged from $7 to $33, with a mean of $16; personal
care aide hourly costs ranged from $4.50 to $11.50, with a
mean of $7.20; and housekeeper hourly costs ranged from
$4.70 to $10, with a mean of $6.60. Weekly average nurs-
ing home charges varied from $271 to $482. It should be
noted that sites varied widely in geographical region and
degree of urbanization and, hence, in service prices.
RESULTS
Results From Estimating the Hazard Functions
The Nursing Home Hazard.--Hazard function results are
reported in Tables 2 and 3. We turn first to the hazard for
nursing home exit, which was estimated allowing for unob-
served heterogeneity using the procedure developed by
Trussell and Richards (1985) for applying the Heckman-
Singer model, as noted earlier: individuals may belong to
one of up to several classes with respect to the hazard (and,
hence, with respect to expected duration of nursing home
stays). To determine the number of classes K of individuals,
Trussell and Richards proposed starting with a single class
and then adding classes incrementally until the resulting
log-likelihood improvement falls to less than unity.
Following this approach, we found two discernible
classes of individuals, which we descriptively termed short-
stayers and long-stayers. The empirical results for the
single-class model (simple Weibull) and the two-class
model (Weibull with 2-point heterogeneity) are presented in
Table 2. Adding a third class (in fact, we tested up to ten
classes) resulted in negligible increase in the log-likelihood.
The bias for a when the effects of omitted variables are
not controlled is apparent from Table 2. With a single class,
a = 0.793 (indicating negative duration dependence), but a
moves up to 1.048 when a second class is added. In fact,
the second value is insignificantly different from unity at
the 5% level (the standard error is .0793), implying that we
cannot reject the hypothesis that the true nursing home haz-
ard is just a structurally time-varying exponential, that is, a
constant holding pnk
fixed.
The coefficients on the nonservice covariates, which in-
terpret the change in the log-hazard due to a unit change in
the covariate, are generally consistent with expectations
and with earlier work and will not be considered in detail

here (cf. Cohen et al., 1993; Cohen, Tell, & Wallack, 1988;
Coward, Home, & Peek, 1995; Coward, Netzer, & Mul-
lens, 1996; Dwyer, Barton, & Vogel, 1994; Engle &
Graney, 1993; Garber & MaCurdy, 1989; McFall & Miller,
1992; Rabiner, Stearns, & Mutran, 1994; Wolinsky, Calla-
han, Fitzgerald, & Johnson, 1993).
Crucially, all coefficients for the service variables are
positive, indicating that higher levels of each service, other
things equal, are associated with a greater likelihood of re-
turn to the community. The coefficients involving home
nursing services are notably larger than those for other ser-
vices. Notable also is that higher levels of impairment in
ADL, IADL, and cognitive functioning and poorer self-
rated health are all associated with lower chance of return
to the community. Being at a demonstration site with
greater bed supply significantly decreases the chance of dis-
charge to the community, whereas being in a treatment
group at a financial control site and having higher income
increase the chance.
The Community Hazard.--Turning to the hazard for
nursing home entry (Table 3), one sees that all service coef-
ficients are negative, indicating again, as one would expect,
that higher levels of services, other things being equal, are
associated with a lower risk of nursing home admission.

Again, the marginal effect of home nursing services consid-
erably exceeds that of other services. With respect to the
other covariates, being Hispanic or African American,
being a homeowner, having a larger number of surviving
children, and being in a Channeling Demonstration treat-
ment group are all associated with a significantly lower risk
of nursing home admission. Conversely, living alone, being
severely impaired in IADL, ADL, or cognitive functioning,
and being in an area with a greater nursing home bed sup-
ply are all associated with greater risk of admission. All
these findings are generally consistent with existing find-
ings in the literature cited previously. Anomalies are wheel-
chair use (associated significantly with lower risk of ad-
mission) and better self-rated health (associated with higher
admission risk), for which various post hoc hypotheses
might be advanced.
The fact that the service coefficients have the appropriate
signs ensures that the objective function for the optimiza-
tion will be strictly convex and thus the optimization algo-
rithm will converge to a true global optimum (here, mini-
mum cost).
Results of the Optimization
Although all 4,158 cases with complete data in the Chan-
neling Demonstration public use data files were used as our
analysis sample in estimating the hazard rate coefficients,
the problem of interest in the optimization turns on the re-
sponses of individuals in the demonstration population as
they were found prior to the effects of the demonstration in-
tervention itself. Thus, results reported are based on the

1,517 persons in our analysis sample who belonged to the
demonstration control groups; that is, those participants who
did not receive services from the demonstration, but who
were essentially statistically equivalent to those who did.
Cost reduction results (costs are in 1982 dollars), al-
though not dramatic--as one would expect given that the
optimization prohibits any reductions in existing cost-inef-
ficient home care service use--are nevertheless substantial.
Because of the constraint given in expression 18, cost re-
ductions are possible only through increasing home care
service levels in cases where resulting reductions in ex-
pected nursing home use are more than sufficient to offset
the costs of the services. Table 4 shows that the optimum
service allocation was found to reduce expected total week-
ly expenditures for long-term care overall in this population
from $200,119 to $179,837, a decline of just over 10%.
This was, we emphasize, achieved by targeted additions to
existing, nondemonstration home care services already
being received, resulting in an increase in weekly home
care service expenditures of $27,856 (from $88,871 to
$116,727) or about 31%. However, these costs were more
than offset by the $48,138 decline (from $111,248 to
$63,110) in expected weekly nursing home expenditures
that resulted from this increased use of home care services.
These results are of particular interest in comparison to the
Channeling Demonstration itself, which also attempted to re-
duce overall long-term care costs through targeted additions
of home care services, but was unable to break even. Also
presented in Table 4 for comparison are cost data from the
demonstration's financial control site treatment groups mea-
sured six months from baseline and scaled for group size to
be comparable to the control group data (see also Brown &
Phillips, 1986). By comparing these data to those observed
for the control group, we see that the demonstration in-
creased overall long-term care costs substantially (by about
12%) because its decrease in nursing home costs (relative to
the control group) was more than offset by its large increase
in home care expenditures (about 61%). In short, when effi-
ciently allocated, the optimal home care expenditure level
achieved a greater reduction in expected nursing home ex-
penditures, while spending only about half as much on addi-
tional home care services as did the Channeling Demonstra-
tion's financial control intervention.

Our optimization model achieved its savings by two
means: (a) tighter targeting of services to those at higher
risk and (b) altering the mix of services provided. In ancil-
lary analyses not reported here, the optimization was found
to give relatively more resources than the actual demonstra-
tion did to those who were older, who lived alone, who
were more grievously impaired in ADL, IADL, or cogni-
tion, and who lived in areas with greater numbers of nurs-
ing home beds per person over age 65. Not surprisingly,
these are all characteristics associated with greater nursing
home risk, the reduction of which was the only way that the
optimization could recover its home care costs. On the
other hand, the optimization tends to give relatively fewer
additional resources to minorities, men, homeowners, those
with better self-reported health, those with higher income,
and those with more surviving children. The relative ne-
glect of persons with these characteristics in turn reflects
low relative prior nursing home risk and, therefore, fewer
opportunities to generate larger risk reductions in response
to additional home care services.
Although technically explicable, the finding of a relative
disinclination of the optimization algorithm to provide ad-
ditional services to African and Hispanic Americans is po-
tentially troubling on social equity grounds (cf. Greene &
Monahan, 1984). Arguably, the model should be made
"blind" to racial and ethnic considerations by constraining
these coefficients in the objective function to be zero. The
loss in underwriting efficiency resulting from such a con-
straint is a matter for future research.
The reductions in cost achieved by the optimum alloca-
tion reflect not only retargeting of services as a function of
individual characteristics, but also entail a fairly radical cor-
responding alteration in the aggregate mix of services being
provided. This is evident in Table 5, where a comparison of
the distribution of service hours by type for the Channeling
Demonstration's financial control intervention with that for
the control group shows that the demonstration increased
hours used in all service types, but by far increased them
most dramatically in personal care services. Already the
most popular service type before the intervention, the
demonstration more than doubled its utilization, greatly in-
creasing its relative share of the portfolio of services.
Although the optimum allocation also differs from the
preintervention service hours distribution, it does so very
differently than the Channeling Demonstration did. The op-
timization produces a dramatic (almost fourfold) increase
in home nursing hours, with modest increases in home

health aide and housekeeper hours. Notably, the optimiza-
tion does not increase personal care service hours at all.
That is, the cost-minimizing changes are virtually opposite
those implemented by the Channeling Demonstration.
These patterns are similar to those found in our earlier stud-
ies, though they are less pronounced due to the optimiza-
tion being more constrained in this study in that it could not
reduce preexisting consumption (Greene et al., 1995).
If one considers the incidence of use (the percentage of a
group that actually uses services), one sees in Table 6 a
similar pattern. Compared to the control group at baseline,
the financial control intervention increased incidence of use
for all services except housekeeping, but with the most dra-
matic absolute increase being in personal care aide services
(an increase of over 20%--from 39.1% to 61.6%). This is
again in contrast to the cost-minimizing solution, where
home nursing saw the most dramatic incidence increase--
from 14.4% to 54.0%--with other incidence changes being
very modest.
Our optimization model, in seeking to reduce overall
long-term care costs, might be said to produce a more
"medicalized" model of home care than that which was ac-
tually found in place prior to the Channeling Demonstration
and further implemented through the demonstration. This
result may seem surprising in view of the higher relative
prices of service by health care providers, but it arises be-
cause home nursing hours have a greater marginal impact
on expected nursing home use for many individuals than do
hours of the lower level (and lower priced) services, there-
by being better able to offset the cost of their use; that is,
they give more "bang for the buck" in many cases, despite
their higher unit cost.
To guard against the risk that the relatively much larger
marginal effects of home nursing might simply reflect sam-
pling instability in the estimation process, the optimization
was rerun with the home nursing coefficients in each hazard
reduced by one standard error and the other coefficients in-
creased by one standard error. The results were similar to
those reported here, though the rerun optimization pro-
duced a less dramatic increase in use of home nursing and
slightly larger expansions of home health aide and house-
keeper services. Notably, personal care aide services were
again never increased.
These findings should not be entirely unexpected, not-
withstanding widespread concerns about the cost implica-
tions of "medicalizing" home care. Nursing hours generally

reflect services by much more highly trained and qualified
providers than do other home care services, and hence we
would expect marginal impacts on relevant outcomes to be
greater. Further, home nursing services represent a substi-
tute for higher level nursing home services; services that
are required for precisely the sort of needs that, if unmet in
the community, would most rapidly force an individual into
nursing home care and that are the most difficult to obtain
from nonprofessional (e.g., family) sources.
Obviously, people use home care services for many pur-
poses other than trying to reduce their risk of nursing home
use and net long-term care costs--for example, improving
or maintaining their quality of life in the community. But
for the case managers at the financial control sites in the
Channeling Demonstration, who had as a specific goal re-
ducing long-term care costs through deterring nursing
home use, the overwhelming tendency to use their case-
management resources and service budgets to provide a
larger volume of cheaper, lower level services (mainly per-
sonal care services), while providing proportionately much
less additional home nursing, may have been an unfortu-
nate approach from a cost-containment standpoint.
In comparing our results for the optimum allocation, in
which overall long-term care costs (costs for nursing home
use and direct home care services) were reduced 10% from
their preexisting levels, with the performance of the compa-
rable Channeling Demonstration financial control interven-
tion (under which these costs on average increased 12%), it
appears that a more stringently targeted and more medically
oriented model of intervention would have better served the
goals of reducing nursing home use and long-term care costs.
DISCUSSION
Our results clearly support the case for the potential cost-
effectiveness of substantially expanding budgets for home
care services. The optimization itself increased preexisting
home care expenditures by over 30%, but reduced expected
total costs through reducing expected nursing home use.
In considering such an expansion, however, two essential
points should be kept in mind. First, services must be tar-
geted much more effectively to those at higher risk than was
the case in the Channeling Demonstration, perhaps through
using more powerful statistical models. And second,
notwithstanding current enthusiasm and advocacy for per-
sonal care services, quite possibly justified in terms of the
ability of such services to improve the quality of life at home
for frail older people, we must not overlook the fact that sig-
nificant expansion of their use, at the expense of possible ex-
pansion of other services, does not seem justified in terms of
cost containment or potential to reduce nursing home use.
In view of the complexity of even simple analyses of the
process by which long-term care costs arise (this study is an
example), one possible means of improving case manage-
ment decision making with respect to cost containment for
home care service allocation may be through a computer-
ized decision support system, for which the type of method-
ology used here might serve as a prototype. Such consider-
ations might be especially important in administering home
care services within a managed care framework, where effi-
ciency is essential.
