Abstract
The phenomenon of substance abuse during pregnancy has fostered much controversy, specifically
regarding treatment vs. punishment. Should the pregnant mother who engages in substance abuse
be viewed as a criminal or as someone suffering from an illness requiring appropriate treatment?
As it happens, there is a noticeably wide range of responses to this matter in the various states of
the United States, ranging from a strictly criminal perspective to one that does emphasize the
importance of the mother's treatment. This diversity of dramatically different responses illustrates
the failure to establish a uniform policy for the management of this phenomenon. Just as there is
lack of consensus among those who favor punishment, the same lack of consensus characterizes
those states espousing treatment. Several general policy recommendations are offered here
addressing the critical issues. It is hoped that by focusing on these fundamental issues and ultimately
detailing statistics, policymakers throughout the United States will consider the course of action
that views both pregnant mother and fetus/child as humanely as possible.
Overview and nature of the problem
Introduction
The purpose of this review is to summarize policy research
findings in the area of maternal prenatal substance abuse
to (1) inform and advance this field, (2) identify future
research needs, (3) inform policy making and (4) identify
implications for policy. As a review, this is a systematic
analysis of existing data (findings) on maternal drug use
during pregnancy for determining the best policy among
the alternatives for dealing with drug using mothers and
their children. We will address issues of efficacy (which
policies work?), economics (how much does it cost?) and
politics (who is it for or against?). For new policies we will
also consider how they fit with existing policies or laws,
the social impact, ethical issues and the feasibility of
implementation and administration.
The issue of substance abuse is one that has perpetually
plagued society. The complexities surrounding addiction
are not easily overcome. These complexities are even more
defined in cases of substance abuse by pregnant women,
an issue that has been pushed to the forefront of the pub-
lic consciousness over the course of the past 20 years.
Maternal prenatal substance abuse is defined as chronic
use of alcohol and/or other drugs [1]. The acronym AOD
is often used to describe the generic problem of alcohol
and other drugs. However, AOD is not specific to mothers
and includes both prenatal and postnatal use as well as
use by men. This review will encompass the three main
types of addictive substances used during pregnancy: alco-
hol, tobacco and illegal drugs (ATID). Maternal Alcohol,
Tobacco and Illegal Drugs (MATID) will be used to
describe maternal use of these substances during preg-
nancy that threatens the well being of the child.

Rising cocaine use and the emergence of crack cocaine use
in the 1980s created a public outcry and redress and
served to shine the spotlight on this issue. One of the
goals of this review is to see how what we learned from the
cocaine controversy can be applied to issues arising from
abuse of other (legal and illegal) drugs. The review will
address policies on several levels including federal, state,
and local public policies. Legal and ethical issues will also
be considered. As this article goes to press, the U.S.
Supreme Court has declined to hear the case of a South
Carolina woman convicted of murder homicide by child
abuse after her stillborn baby was found with cocaine in
its system. This case could have major policy implications
for the treatment of drug using mothers and for the inter-
pretation of child abuse charges.
Background
The sensationalistic coverage of the "crack epidemic" in
the mid-1980s focused national attention on the relation-
ship between drug use, and the social and economic con-
ditions that plagued our society. These include poverty,
violent crime, overcrowded prisons, hospital emergency
rooms overcrowded with drug related violence and ill-
ness, homelessness and sexually transmitted diseases [2].
About 11 percent of the adult population of the United
States suffers from a substance abuse problem (AOD) dur-
ing the course of a year [3]. That figure increases to 28% if
we include substance abuse or mental health disorders,
which are often inseparable [3]. Of the 10 leading causes
of disability worldwide in 1990, five were psychiatric con-
ditions including AOD [3]. The cost to society of drug use
including crime, health care and reduced work productiv-
ity was estimated at over 300 billion dollars annually [4].
In 1997, the total expenditure for treatment of substance
abuse was $11.9 billion in contrast to the social costs of
$294 billion estimated for that year [3]. In addition, sub-
stance abuse is a contributing factor in child abuse and
neglect cases for 40% or more of the 1.2 million annual
confirmed cases of child maltreatment [5] and in 40­80%
of families involved with the child welfare system [6]. The
presence of substance use disorders in parents increases
the risk of child maltreatment threefold or more [7,8].
These children are also at substantial risk of placement in
out-of-home care [9].
Drug use in this country is not a recent phenomenon.
Legal use of opiates in America has a 200-year-old history
and cocaine has been around since the 1870s. Illicit drug
use by women is also not new. By the end of the 19th cen-
tury, almost two thirds of the nation's opium and mor-
phine addicts were women [2]. The issue of drug use
during pregnancy garnered the national spotlight starting
in the 1960's when public attention began to focus on the
possible harm to the unborn child. Less than 15 years after
Chuck Yaeger shattered the sound barrier, several events
combined to shatter the placental barrier ­ the notion that
the fetus was protected and even invulnerable. The pla-
cental "barrier" suddenly became quite porous. The
rubella (German measles) epidemic and, in particular, the
tragedies caused by two drugs, thalidomide and diethyl-
stilbestrol (DES), amplified public sentiment about the
need for protecting the fetus from risks from drug use.
Thalidomide was approved for marketing in 1958 and
was used primarily as a sedative and antidote for nausea
in early pregnancy. By 1962, evidence showed that a rare
set of deformities, mostly limb malformations, were
caused by the drug and 8,000 children had been affected
[10]. DES was a synthetic hormone prescribed in the
1940s and 1950s to prevent miscarriage. By the late 1960s
and 1970s, the side effects of the drug became known: the
daughters of women who had taken DES during preg-
nancy developed a rare adrenocarcinoma of the vagina.
Licit and illicit drugs became suspect as possible tera-
togens, and the activities, diet and behaviors of pregnant
women have been under close scrutiny ever since [11].
As the country was coping with these events in the early
1970's, studies in the U.S. [12-14] and in France [15]
began to describe the effects of fetal alcohol syndrome
(FAS) including dysmorphic features, growth retardation,
central nervous system problems, long term retardation
and developmental delays [16]. One response was the
1989 federal law that required warnings on all alcohol-
containing beverages about the risk of birth defects. Also
in the 1970s, research documented child outcome associ-
ated with opiate addiction in pregnant women including
withdrawal effects in infants exposed to heroin or metha-
done [17,18]. There is currently a resurgence of heroin use
due to the introduction of a cheap, smokeable and more
pure form comparable to crack cocaine but more potent.
Maternal prenatal substance abuse became an issue for
public health debate in the mid-1980s when the price of
cocaine dropped, and a smokeable form, "crack" became
widely available. The heightened attention came in
response to the emergence of a perceived crack epidemic
and their infants were labeled, "crack babies" [1]. Cocaine
is a special case because it riveted our attention of the
problem of drug use by pregnant women, it became a
moral as well as a public health issue and has forever
changed the way we think about substance use by preg-
nant women.
Cocaine has a long history of use in this country. It was
first introduced in the 1880s as a wonder drug. Doctors
hailed its ability to counteract melancholy, or depression.
It was made readily available to the public as a treatment
for sinusitis and hay fever. It was used in soft drinks such
as Coca-Cola until 1900. Upon its first introduction it was
used as a panacea for all that ailed people. However by
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5

1910 there were numerous proposals for laws against its
use because of its association with violence, paranoia, and
collapsed careers [19].
By 1980, the United States had entered another period of
widespread use of the drug. There are several reasons why
crack was very popular at the time. These reasons include
the fact that it is smoked rather than injected, it was a
cheap high after the 1980s cocaine price plunge, and it
was conducive to binge use [20]. In 1986 the U.S. House
of Representatives, Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse
and Control and Select Committee on Children, Youth,
and Families defined the widespread use of cocaine as a
crisis. The testimony of the Honorable Charles Rangel
during the committee hearing on "The Crack Cocaine Cri-
sis" epitomized the feelings of lawmakers of the time.
According to Judge Rangel, "Cocaine is threatening the
vitality of the generation of Americans we are counting on
to lead us into the 21st century...The crack epidemic is part
of the overall cocaine abuse problem in America. This
problem will continue as long as... the Administration
and State Department view the international drug prob-
lem as "business as usual." Only when we give the drug
problem the foreign policy priority it deserves will we ever
begin to get a handle on the cocaine crisis sweeping our
nation" [21]. To this end, Congress passed the 1986 Nar-
cotics Penalties and Enforcement Act, imposing severe
penalties on any person convicted of either possessing or
distributing cocaine [22].
The war(s) on dugs
There is a long history of legislative intervention and con-
trol over the use of those drugs deemed dangerous. The
drug war is the name conventionally given to the efforts of
the Regan and Bush administrations against the wide-
spread availability and use of illicit drugs in the United
States during the 1980's and early 1990's. It is actually the
fourth such war: Sustained legislative and governmental
efforts to combat drug abuse occurred in 1909­23, 1951­
56 and 1971­73 [23]. The drug war has included treat-
ment of addicts and prevention but the emphasis has
been on law enforcement; control at the source, interdic-
tion, arrest, prosecution, imprisonment and seizure of
assets. Even in the 19th century the United States
attempted to prevent acute poisoning by implementing
regulations that called for the labeling of certain sub-
stances that might be purchased in ignorance of their
lethal potential or might be too easily available for sui-
cide. During this time, Americans bought whatever types
of drugs they wanted over the counter or through mail
order catalogs. Doctors regularly prescribed morphine
and opium to their patients as the primary pain control
drugs [22].
In response to consumer demand, Congress passed the
Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. This act mandated cor-
rect labeling. Any "patent medicine" had to reveal on the
label whether it contained morphine, cocaine, cannabis,
or chloral hydrate. The act simply required that consum-
ers be informed that the drugs were present. It made no
attempt to regulate the purchase of the drug or how much
of the drug could be included in substances [19]. The
country's drug policy changed with the 1914 passage of
the Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act and with Supreme Court
decisions, [24,25] which allowed new drug fighting poli-
cies. When it took effect in 1919, the law outlawed the
maintenance of addicts on prescription narcotic medica-
tion. It also empowered the federal government to take
nationwide action to arrest and convict health profession-
als who practiced maintenance of narcotic-addicted
patients. A few months later in 1919, the Volstead Act
widened the "no maintenance" policy to alcohol. The act
made drinking alcoholic beverages illegal [22].
The emphasis on drug interdiction and policing has
resulted in an increase in the national drug budget over
the last 20­25 years. According to the Office of National
Drug Control Policy, Federal spending on drug control
has increased from 1.5 billion in 1981 to 19.2 billion in
2002 [26,27]. Since 1990 the percent of the National Drug
Control Budget earmarked for prevention and treatment
has remained relatively stable at approximately 33%. The
funds covered by this 33% include drug abuse treatment,
drug abuse prevention, and prevention research and treat-
ment research. Approximately 10% is spent on research
and approximately 1 1/2 times more is spent on drug
abuse treatment than on drug abuse prevention. Treat-
ment alone accounts for only 15% of the budget. Given
that research has shown that treatment and prevention are
effective, one wonders why these proportions of the
National Drug Control Budget have not been increased.
The drug control budget has more than doubled in the
past decade, yet the proportion of the budget devoted to
treatment and prevention is unchanged, despite the gains
made in science.
It is also interesting to contrast Federal spending with
States spending on drug abuse. A recently released study
(Shoveling Up: The Impact of Substance Abuse on State
Budgets), found that in 1998, states spent 81.3 billion
dollars on substance abuse and addiction representing
13.1 percent of the 620 billion dollars in State spending.
In contrast to the Federal budget in which 66% of the
budget is spent on enforcement, the State budgets spent
38% on justice with other funds spent on education
(21%), health (19.5%), child family assistance (9%) and
mental health and developmental disabilities (7.5%).

Epidemiology and prevalence rates
Numerous attempts to answer the question of the preva-
lence of prenatal exposure have been made reflecting a
variety of definitions, sampling procedures and drug use
detection procedures [11]. Settings vary and include hos-
pitals, public health clinics and prenatal practices. Sam-
pling includes the country as a whole, entire states as well
as individual counties. Drug use is typically detected by
maternal report, history or urine testing. The National
Pregnancy and Health Survey (NPHS) was designed to
provide a nationally representative sample of live births in
the contiguous 48 states between November 1992 and
August 1993 based on maternal self-report [28]. The prev-
alence for use of any illicit drug during pregnancy was
5.5% or approximately 221,000 pregnant women. For
cocaine the estimate was 1.1% (45,000). Comparisons of
self-report and urine in a subset of this sample suggested
underreporting in the use of cocaine.
The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA)
contains 1999 national estimates ages 12 years and older
based on interviews with 66,706 persons. The NHSDA
estimated that among women 15 to 44 years old, rates of
current use of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs 1999 were
47.8%, 31%, and 7.9%, respectively. Table 1 compares
drug use between pregnant and non-pregnant women.
Among pregnant women 15­44 years of age, 3.4%
reported using illicit drugs. This was significantly lower
than the rate among non-pregnant women age 15­44
years (8.1%). For example, cocaine is .2% for pregnant
but .9% for non-pregnant. Methamphetamine is scary
because it is the only illicit drug that does not have a lower
rate for pregnant (.2%) than for non-pregnant women
(.2%) [11]. For pregnant women in the 15­44 age group,
3.4%, 17.6%, and 13.8%, respectively, used illicit drugs,
tobacco, and alcohol, indicating that a large number of
women continued their substance use during pregnancy.
In the United States in 1999, there were 3,944,450 births
to women aged 15 to 44 years [11]. Using NHSDA esti-
mates of substance use during pregnancy, the approxi-
mate numbers of births in 1999 complicated by maternal
use of illicit drugs, tobacco, and alcohol were 134,110;
694,220; and 544,330, respectively [29]. Thus, from the
public health perspective, the impact of substance use
during pregnancy extends far beyond maternal health to
that of a large number of the unborn population.
There is also overlap between licit and illicit drugs.
Approximately 32% of women who use illicit drugs dur-
ing pregnancy also use alcohol and cigarettes [30]. From
these estimates it has been suggested that approximately 1
million children each year are exposed to legal or illegal
substances (i.e. MATID) during gestation [31]. It is also
important to point out that the NHSDA is based on self-
report of drug use and therefore likely to underestimate
the extent of prenatal drug exposure. Just as with other
drugs, it is very difficult to isolate the true prevalence of
prenatal cocaine use among pregnant women because
prevalence rates are often dependent on self-reporting by
the women. In a study by Vega and colleagues in the early
1990s, it was discovered that 1.1 percent of California
expectant mothers used cocaine within 12 to 72 hours of
labor and delivery [32]. The lack of true prevalence rates
can also be attributed to the lack of focus on those groups
that are considered to be "low-risk" for drug use, e.g. mid-
dle class, non-minority populations.
There are groups considered high risk based upon patterns
of use. Cocaine use is especially concentrated among poor
women of color. In the Vega et al. [32] study, it was found
that 7.8 percent of African Americans compared with 0.55
percent of Hispanics and 0.60 percent of Caucasians
tested positive for cocaine use. This figure became even
more pronounced when looking at subgroups of poor
women. Nearly 1/3 of unmarried pregnant African Amer-
ican Medicaid recipients in their mid-thirties tested posi-
tive for cocaine [33].

Methods of identification of drug using women
The accurate identification of prenatal drug exposure is
important not only to understand the nature and magni-
tude of the problem, but also to determine appropriate
medical and psychosocial intervention. The prevalence of
prenatal drug exposure is very difficult to estimate because
of flaws in all methods of identification. Methods vary
and include interview, self-administered questionnaires,
intake history, urine testing of mother and infant, testing
of infant hair and meconium (first stool of the newborn).
Maternal self-report of drug use is problematic because of
the fear of the consequences of admitting to the use of
drugs such as Child Protective Services (CPS) involvement
and the threat of child removal, or because it is socially
unacceptable. Self-report is also unreliable because of the
inaccuracy of recall, especially when questions such as
"when", "how often" and "how much" are asked. Under-
reporting of drug use by pregnant women has been
reported in several studies [34-37]. In a sample in which
43% of mothers were positive for illegal drugs during
pregnancy, only 11% admitted illegal drug use [35]. Frank
found that self-report misclassified 24% of cocaine users
identified by urine toxicology, and in Lester et al, [34]
38% of mothers denied cocaine or opiate use during preg-
nancy but the infant's meconium was positive.
Infant biomarkers of in-utero exposure to illegal and legal
drugs including cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, mari-
juana and nicotine, are available from different speci-
mens. Although urine has been the widely used specimen,
increasing evidence suggests that meconium is preferable
[35,38-44]. For example, cocaine metabolites are measur-
able in urine for only 96­120 hours after the last cocaine
use in contrast to meconium, which can detect cocaine
use throughout the second half of pregnancy. The primary
metabolite of nicotine is cotinine and can be measured in
urine and meconium. Cotinine is also readily passed from
mother to infant, with fetal cotinine concentrations in
pregnant smokers reaching approximately 90% of mater-
nal values during pregnancy [45]. A recent assay has been
developed for detecting alcohol in meconium using fatty
acid ethyl esters [46]. Hair analysis can also be used to
detect drugs, and like meconium has the advantage of
reflecting more than recent use [47].
In addition to the choice of specimen, the accurate detec-
tion of prenatal drug exposure is influenced by the choice
of initial screening test and use of a confirmation proce-
dure. Moore et al. [48] found a 43% false positive rate for
cocaine when screens were used without confirmation.
Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the
forensic standard for confirmation of presumptive posi-
tive screens. Lester et al. [34] confirmed 75% of presump-
tive positive screens for cocaine using GC/MS in a sample
of over 8,500. However, that still leaves 25% of mothers
that would have incorrectly identified had we relied on a
screen alone. Choice of metabolites can also affect accu-
racy of identification. We [34] used four metabolites for
cocaine, and one of them, HBE, was the only metabolite
found in 235 of the cases. Finally, some drugs are more
difficult to detect than others. Even with GC/MS we were
only able to confirm 36% of the presumptive positives for
marijuana.
The advantage of using both drug toxicology and mater-
nal self-report has been shown in several studies
[34,35,37,49,50]. It is also important to distinguish
between maternal reports based on a structured question-
naire and information collected about the mother from
medical record review as the latter is less reliable, and may
not be appropriate for comparison with toxicology
results. The importance of using both a biomarker (pref-
erably meconium) and maternal self-report is to identify
mothers who deny use but did use as evidence by positive
GC/MS confirmation. It is generally assumed that moth-
ers will not report that they used drugs if they did not.
Finally, it would not be wise to rely only on meconium, as
this assay is only valid for the second half of pregnancy.
Agreement between positive maternal report and positive
toxicology has been reported at 66% [34,51]. This is to be
expected because infants of mothers who report that they
used cocaine, but not in the second half of pregnancy, will
have a negative meconium for appropriate reasons.
Research on prenatal MATID exposure and child outcome
MATID use during pregnancy is a major public health
issue and a social policy concern because of the possible
adverse effect or harm to the developing child caused by
the chemical effect of the drug, i.e., the drug as a toxin. The
best documentation of this effect is for alcohol. The tera-
togenic effects of alcohol are well established. The brain is
particularly vulnerable with documented sites of damage
including the cerebellum, hippocampus, basal ganglia
and corpus collosum [52-54]. One study estimated that
approximately 2.6 million women of 4 million who give
birth each year use alcohol at some point during their
pregnancy [3]. Another suggested that nearly 22,000
school age children per year experience adverse affects
caused by their mother's alcohol use [55]. One of the
most widely chronicled problems attributed to alcohol
use is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS was first
described in the published medical literature in 1968 and
refers to a constellation of physical abnormalities. FAS
produces slow growth, damage to the nervous system,
facial abnormalities and mental retardation. It is most
obvious in the features of the face and in the reduced size
of the newborn, and in problems of behavior and cogni-
tion in children born to mothers who drank heavily dur-
ing pregnancy. Rates of FAS range from .5 to 3 cases per
1,000 births or 2000 ­ 12,000 per year in the U.S.
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5

(page number not for citation purposes)
FAS is caused by prenatal exposure to high levels of alco-
hol; however, the definition of "high" is not specific. For
example, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) definition
includes terms such as "substantial, regular intake or
heavy episodic drinking" as well as associated alcohol
related effects, behaviors and problems but these terms
are not defined. Heavy drinking by pregnant women has
been estimated at less than 1%. (IOM).
In addition to FAS, there are children who do not show
the facial dysmorphology of FAS but who do show deficits
on a wide variety of neurobehavioral measures. Different
labels have been used to describe this heterogeneous
group including fetal alcohol effects (FAE) and alcohol-
related neuro-developmental disabilities (ARND).
ARND/FAE may reflect more moderate levels of alcohol
exposure as well as some degree of uncertainly about
whether alcohol or other factors was the causal agent
(IOM). Alcohol has the potential to produce milder prob-
lems such as mental and behavioral problems as well [56]
and these may also be due to FAE/ARND.
The IOM report concludes that FAS is arguably the most
common known non-genetic cause of mental retardation.
They also conclude that FAS and ARND are a completely
preventable set of birth defects and neurodevelopmental
abnormalities. We would argue that the latter is true for
the consequences of tobacco and illegal drugs as well.
Tobacco is another legal drug that can have adverse effects
on fetuses. Cigarette smoking is the largest single risk fac-
tor for premature death among adults in developed coun-
tries, causing over 500,000 deaths per year, or one in every
5 deaths. Currently, there are 57 million cigarette smokers
in the United States ­ roughly one quarter of the adult
population. The majority of smokers fall between 18 ­ 25
years of age; 37% of people in this age range are smokers
[57,58]. Cigarette smoking is correlated with low socio-
economic status, reduced educational achievement, and
disadvantaged neighborhood environment, as well as
younger age [58].
Approximately 12.3% of all mothers report cigarette
smoking while pregnant [59]. Cigarette smoke is a com-
plex mixture of chemicals [60] with approximately 4000
compounds, [61] including carbon monoxide, that may
also affect the fetus. Maternal smoking during pregnancy
produces adverse effects for the fetus through several path-
ways. First, cigarette smoke interferes with normal placen-
tal function. As metabolites of cigarette smoke pass
through the placenta from mother to fetus, they act as
vasoconstrictors to reduce uterine blood flow by up to
38% [62]. The fetus is deprived of nutrients and oxygen,
resulting in episodic fetal hypoxia-ischemia and malnutri-
tion [63]. This is the basis for the fetal intrauterine growth
retardation seen in many infants born to smoking moth-
ers. Studies have shown that smoking is responsible for
20­30% of all infants of low birthweight, and that infants
born to smoking mothers weigh an average 150­250
grams less than infants born to nonsmoking mothers
[64].
Second, the nicotine in cigarette smoke acts as a neuroter-
atogen that interferes with fetal development, specifically
the developing nervous system [65]. In utero, nicotine tar-
gets nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the fetal brain to
change the pattern of cell proliferation and differentia-
tion. Fetal nicotine exposure up-regulates nicotinic
cholinergic receptor binding sites, causing abnormalities
in the development of synaptic activity [66]. The end
result is cell loss and ultimately, neuronal damage. Fur-
thermore, because concentrations of nicotine on the fetal
side of the placenta generally reach levels 15% higher than
maternal levels, even low levels of cigarette smoking may
expose the fetus to harmful amounts of nicotine [67,68].
As preclinical studies have shown, fetal doses of nicotine
that do not result in low birthweight still produce deficits
in fetal brain development [65]. Cigarettes contain many
hazardous toxic chemicals, including nicotine, hydrogen
cyanide, and carbon monoxide. Ingestion of these harm-
ful toxins into the fetal blood supply can cause problems
in newborns such as low birth weight, pre-term delivery,
slow fetal development, and infant mortality [69-71].
Although the effects of cigarette smoking on fetal growth
retardation have been known for many years, more recent
work has linked prenatal nicotine exposure to sudden
infant death syndrome as well as short and longer term
behavioral and cognitive problems [72-77] including
effects on IQ [78]. In a recent study, we [79] found a dose
response relationship between cotinine (the major metab-
olite of nicotine) in the mothers saliva at delivery and the
neurobehavior of the newborn suggesting possible with-
drawal effects from cigarette smoking during pregnancy.
In addition, the effects were observed at less than 7 ciga-
rettes per day, which is below the threshold of 10 ciga-
rettes per day typically reported for the effects on birth
weight. In another study, maternal genotype was found to
alter the effect of smoking on infant birthweight [80]. This
could suggest that genetic influences may also explain
why some nicotine exposed infants show neurobehavio-
ral deficits while others do not.
In addition to these prenatal mechanisms there are post-
natal mechanisms through which smoking can affect the
child. These include research on the transmission of nico-
tine through breast milk and its harmful effects, and the
consequences of second-hand smoke exposure on chil-
dren [46,81,82]. The toxic effects of tobacco are illustrated
by a study in which infants of nonsmoking mothers who
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5

(page number not for citation purposes)
had environmental exposure to tobacco smoke showed
measurable ill effects [83].
It is positive to note that tobacco use during pregnancy is
on the decline. In 1990 18.4% of pregnant women
smoked (that would result in 736,000 tobacco-exposed
infants); that percent was 13.6% (or 544,000 tobacco
exposed infants) in 1996. Women who do still smoke are
smoking fewer cigarettes than they did in 1990 [84]. These
trends underscore the importance of smoking cessation
programs, particularly for women of childbearing age. At
this opportune time in which the harmful effects of ciga-
rette smoke have been subjected to increasing scrutiny,
efforts aimed at smoking cessation and addiction treat-
ment, as well as studies directed at understanding the
effects of prenatal exposure to nicotine on infants have
definitive relevance in advancing the health and develop-
ment of children.
Illicit drugs are the most often targeted drugs in the fight
against maternal substance abuse, because they are per-
ceived to produce the most harmful side effects in both
the mothers and the children. Whether this is true or not
is a topic that is certainly up for debate. As mentioned ear-
lier, it is hard to pinpoint the exact prevalence of illegal
drug use among pregnant women because figures are
derived from self-reporting by the women or reporting by
a physician. Figures on the frequency of illegal drug use
among pregnant women range from 221,000 to 739,006
[85,86]. There are numerous birth complications attrib-
uted to illegal drug use, including pre-term delivery, low
birth weight, smaller-than-normal head size, miscarriages,
genital and urinary tract deformities, and nervous system
damage [87].
For cocaine, we now know that early scientific reports
were exaggerated, and portrayed children who were
exposed to cocaine in utero as irreparably doomed and
damaged [29,88-90]. Published studies on cocaine-
exposed children suggest a pattern of small deficits in
intelligence and moderate deficits in language [91]. Fur-
ther, cocaine-exposed children at 6 years show deficits in
academic skills including poor sustained attention, more
disorganization, and less abstract thinking [92-94].
Research on prenatal marijuana exposure started slightly
before the explosion of cocaine research in the 1980s.
Developmental effects on executive function have been
reported in a study of 9­12 year olds [78]. However,
despite the fact that marijuana is the most frequently
abused illegal drug, it has not received the attention, as
have other drugs, and there are calls for legalization and
approval for medicinal use. Finally, it has been only
recently that amphetamine/methamphetamine use dur-
ing pregnancy has drawn attention. Longitudinal studies
of development in methamphetamine-exposed children
are just beginning [95].
A lingering puzzle, especially with the cocaine literature, is
the discrepancy between preclinical (animal) and clinical
(human) studies. There is substantial preclinical evidence
that cocaine and other drugs of abuse are neuroteratogens
that can produce serious abnormalities in brain develop-
ment. More recent findings [96] suggest that the behavio-
ral impact of such neural abnormalities that might occur
in humans depends on other complex pre- and postnatal
factors, which may also include genetic vulnerability. We
have seen how public understanding of the impact of pre-
natal exposure has lurched from an initial over-reaction in
which drug-exposed children were characterized as irrevo-
cably and irreversibly damaged to a perhaps equally pre-
mature excessive "sigh of relief" that drugs such as cocaine
do not have lasting effects, especially if children are raised
in appropriate environments. Exaggerated statements
about the benign effects of cocaine as found in Frank et al.
[97] can have negative policy implications. Infants
exposed to drugs in utero may have a milder phenotype
with appropriate environment input. We need to under-
stand combinations of biological (including genetic) pre-
dispositions and environmental conditions that result in
normal development and what specific factors might pro-
mote resilience. This will require changing some of our
models for studying the effects of MATID.
Developmental model
Most studies of MATID use and child developmental out-
come follow the behavioral teratology model. The goal is
to isolate the unique effects of the drug, typically by con-
trolling other variables that could also explain child out-
come [98,99]. This approach is based on our
understanding of the mechanisms of action of ATID, as
well as on preclinical and clinical studies, and enables us
to study the potential pharmacological and toxic effects of
the drugs per se. The limitation of this approach is that it
does not lend itself to study drug exposure as part of a
developmental model in which the goal is to predict child
outcome with ATID as one of many contributing factors.
This is because behavioral teratology research designs typ-
ically treat environmental variables as potential con-
founding factors rather than as a primary focus for
investigation [100]. Developmental-ecological models
have shown that many, if not most, child outcomes are
due to multiple antecedent variables [101].
Developmental models should also take into account the
effects of polydrug exposure. Adverse MATID effects are
thought to be due to mechanisms by which the drugs dis-
rupt programs for brain development associated with
alterations in brain structure and neuronal function that
have unique behavioral consequences. ATID freely cross

the placenta and the developing fetal brain. Typically we
think about the specific or individual effects of each drug,
ethanol and the GABA system, nicotine effects on acetyl-
choline, opiates and the µ, , and  receptors, and the
effects of cocaine on DA, NE, 5-HT. However, in addition
to these mechanisms specific to each drug, recent litera-
ture suggests a mechanism of action common to all drugs
of abuse. Every drug of abuse appears to increase the levels
of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain pathways
that control pleasure. This explanation centers on activa-
tion of specific neural pathways that project from the pons
and midbrain to more rostral forebrain regions, including
the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate
cortex, ventral palladium, and subdivisions of the stria-
tum, particularity the nucleus accumbens [102]. This
model of a final common pathway for all drugs of abuse
is critical because, as documented earlier, most prenatal
drug use is polydrug use. Therefore, understanding these
potential pathways will give us one model for understand-
ing the developmental effects of polydrug use.
Theoretically, we can describe three types of consequences
of MATID on child development (1) immediate drug
effects (2) latent drug effects, and (3) postnatal environ-
ment effects as shown in Figure 1.
Immediate drug effects are direct teratogenic conse-
quences of MATID exposure and emerge during the first
year before postnatal environmental effects become sali-
ent. These effects may be transient, such as catch-up in
physical growth or more long lasting, such as behavioral
disregulation that is observed in infancy and persists
through school age. Latent drug effects are also direct ter-
atogenic effects but reflect brain function that becomes
relevant later in development. There are two kinds of
latent effects. First, MATID can affect brain function that

does not manifest until children are older, including cog-
nitive processes (I.Q., language, executive function and
academic skills), antisocial behavior (conduct disorder
[CD], oppositional defiant disorder [ODD], delinquency,
and externalizing and aggressive behavior problems), sub-
stance use onset, psychopathology (attention deficit dis-
order [ADD], attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
[ADHD], internalizing behavior, depression, and anxi-
ety). Second, MATID affects the brain by causing a predis-
position for dependence on drugs. By "predisposition" we
mean an increase in risk that requires other conditions to
be met. These conditions would be activated during
school age when opportunities to use drugs arise, leading
to early substance use onset.
There is also evidence from the nicotine and alcohol liter-
ature for the biological basis of drug use in children, such
that adolescent or childhood onset of substance use is
related to prenatal exposure. Adolescents are more likely
to smoke if their mothers smoked during pregnancy even
after controlling for later maternal smoking [103-105].
Similar results have been reported for alcohol [106]. In
two cohorts Kandel [103] found that adolescent girls are
more likely to smoke if their mothers smoked during
pregnancy even after controlling for postnatal maternal
smoking. It was suggested that nicotine input to the
dopaminergic system could predispose the brain to later
addictive behavior. Therefore, prenatal exposure may be
related to increased risk of substance abuse in the off-
spring. More recently, Weissman [107] found a 4-fold
increase of prepubertal-onset CD in boys and a 5-fold
increased risk of adolescent onset drug dependence in
girls whose mothers smoked during pregnancy, also unre-
lated to postnatal maternal smoking. Maternal smoking
during pregnancy has also been related to increased
ADHD [108] and CD in boys [109]. In a 14-year follow-
up, [106] prenatal alcohol exposure was more predictive
of adolescent alcohol use and its negative consequences
than was family history of alcohol problems. Moderate to
heavy maternal drinking during pregnancy was related to
current drinking in daughters after controlling for current
maternal drinking and child rearing practices. Prenatal
maternal smoking was also related to elevated rates of
adolescent drinking [110]. Therefore, drug exposure in
utero may alter the brain in ways that increase the risk for
later addiction.
Postnatal environment effects include general environ-
mental factors (socio-demographics, care giving context
and style, and caregiver characteristics) that include both
risk and protective factors. Environmental risk factors are
well established correlates of a variety of poor child out-
comes including cognitive, social, psychological, school,
and health problems that occur in both drug-using and
non-drug using populations. MATID is associated with
general psychosocial risk factors that compromise child
outcome apart from substance abuse issues including
poverty, [111,112] chaotic and dangerous lifestyles,
[113,114] symptoms of psychopathology, [115-119] his-
tory of childhood sexual abuse, [120,121] and involve-
ment in difficult or abusive relationships with male
partners [122,123]. Pregnant women in substance abuse
treatment show a high incidence of psychopathology
[124] including affective and personality disorders
[125,126] and depressive symptoms [127,128]. Pregnant
cocaine using women showed elevated levels of depres-
sion, general mental distress and more psychological
symptoms postpartum [129]. There are also specific
aspects of the caregiving environment unique to AOD
using mothers analogous to the well-documented litera-
ture on "children of alcoholics" (COAs). Passive exposure
to smoke is also a direct teratogenic effect that is also part
of the environment [78].
Another problem with the behavioral teratology model is
that as a deficit model it does not include protective or
resiliency factors that buffer the child against adverse child
outcome. Resiliency factors can be biological (such as self-
righting, compensatory brain mechanism that may be
genetically based) as well as factors such as stable temper-
ament, high motivation, connectedness to parents/others,
consistent parental supervision and discipline, relation-
ship to prosocial institutions, intolerant attitudes toward
deviance, peers with anti-drug attitudes and community
anti-drug norms. Connectedness to others and intoler-
ance of attitudes toward deviance were also highlighted by
the Surgeon General Report [130] on youth violence.
Finally, the model includes the "development" arrow to
indicate that development is a dynamic process. Nature
and nurture are not viewed as static "either/or" categories.
Rather there are reciprocal causal relations between intra-
and extra-individual factors that change over the course of
development.
We can say unequivocally that some children exposed to
drugs in utero have learning and behavioral problems.
Clearly in the case of cocaine the problem is not as severe
as was once feared. We also know that environmental fac-
tors play a large role in determining the development of
drug-exposed children. There is increasing evidence that
amount of exposure makes a difference. This is well estab-
lished for alcohol, for tobacco with respect to effects on
birthweight, and the cocaine literature is just starting to
study level of exposure. There is also some evidence that
timing of exposure makes a difference, again especially for
alcohol. Not all children who are exposed to drugs in utero
show neurobehavioral deficits and those who are affected
display a wide range of neurobehavioral effects. The same

drug, even at the same dose does not appear to produce
the same deficits in all children.
It is almost superfluous to say that advances over the com-
ing years will provide a much clearer picture and deeper
understanding of the long-term effects of prenatal drug
exposure. However, it is not superfluous to say that the
data available today indicate that society must take the
problems of substance abuse during pregnancy very seri-
ously. Priority must be given to programs that help
addicted pregnant women avoid drugs and to programs
that provide postnatal intervention. We know that preven-
tion and treatment programs are effective. We do not
know which are most effective. With limited resources,
clinical trials are necessary, and well-tested programs with
fidelity should be adopted.
We don't have (and we may never have) the complete sci-
entific picture. What we do have is enough information to
make it a priority to identity and treat drug-using pregnant
women and their children. We do know enough to pro-
vide an "antidote to complacency" [131].
There are important limitations to the research on the
developmental consequences of MATID that have policy
implications. First, our knowledge of use patterns (how
much, when and how often during pregnancy drugs are
used) is limited by reliance on self-report (including both
problems associated with memory and reluctance to
reveal drug use due to fear of prosecution and child
removal), and limitations of drug toxicology (including
no bioassay for alcohol). Second, it is not clear whom we
are studying, that is, to what population the developmen-
tal effects of MATID generalize. For example, most women
in the cocaine studies are recreational users; they are not
"hard core" addicts. In the cocaine literature, a "heavy"
use is defined as three or more times per week during the
first trimester. This definition is a function of the patterns
of use detected in the studies and is in sharp contrast to
the heroin addict or methadone user where use is daily for
the entire pregnancy. One reason that the developmental
effects of cigarette smoking may be as strong as the effects
of cocaine is that the use patterns of women who smoke
cigarettes during pregnancy are closer to those of narcotics
than cocaine ­ daily use throughout pregnancy. The sever-
ity of the effects of the drug is one important factor, as is
the pattern of use.
Third, and related to the previous issue is that we know lit-
tle about dose response relationships between MATID
and developmental outcome. There is some evidence for
thresholds in the literature (10 cigarettes/day, .5 oz alco-
hol/day, three days/week cocaine during the first trimes-
ter) but the developmental effects of these thresholds have
not been well established. Fourth, there is virtually no
information on polydrug effects, yet polydrug use is more
common than single drug use. Little is known about the
pharmacology of polydrug use, such as how drug interac-
tions affect fetal development. Although the final com-
mon pathway model involving the dopaminergic system
is attractive it has not been empirically applied to the
child development literature. Fifth, although there are
hundreds of published developmental studies, there are
relatively few long-term outcome studies, and methodo-
logical problems make interpretation difficult. Alcohol
effects, especially FAS and COA, are well established but,
for example, untangling prenatal MATID use from postna-
tal environmental (including parenting) effects on devel-
opmental outcome is still problematic. Sixth, there is the
uncomfortable problem of effect size. Other than FAS, the
literature does not show a devastating pattern of develop-
mental effects. This is fortunate for the many children in
society affected but has left researchers in a quandary with
respect to how to interpret these effects for the public. The
research typically addresses the question of whether or
not there is an association between variables; such as drug
exposure and child outcome. The issue of whether or not
the association is of practical importance, i.e., clinically
significant, is often not addressed, however, this issue is
critical for policymakers. For example, in our multisite
study of prenatal cocaine exposure with 8600 subjects we
did find increased medical problems, however, the preva-
lence rates were low, raising issues as to the clinical signif-
icance of the findings [90]. Most findings are presented in
terms of tests of statistical inference (p value). Effect size
(size of the estimate in standard units) is usually not pre-
sented. The practical importance of an effect is dependent
on two contexts, scientific and empirical [132]. The scien-
tific context refers to the fact that, ideally, policy decisions
would be data-based. However, data, i.e., effect size is con-
strained or decreased by problems in measurement,
design and methods. In other words, measured effects are
likely to be small due to methodological limitations. The
empirical context refers to the fact that results need to be
evaluated in the context of the existing empirical litera-
ture. Meta-analysis is a useful tool for this [132]. For
example, using meta-analysis, we were able to show that
the effect sizes of prenatal cocaine exposure on IQ and
language when children reach school age range from .33­
.71. Our findings [133] from the Maternal Lifestyle Study
of prenatal cocaine exposure and child outcome showed
that the effects of cocaine on IQ actually increased over
time from 1.5 in infancy to 3.5 IQ points at age 7. If this
pattern continues, the deficit will be 7.6 IQ points at age
11. We also found that children in the cocaine exposed
group are more than 1 1/5 times more likely to qualify for
special education services than children in the unexposed
group.

The question that the scientific community and policy
makers have not come to grips with is how to interpret
more subtle effects: what are clinically significant (as
opposed to statistically significant) effects and how do
these effects impact policy including treatment programs?
There are tough questions to answer. If a study does show
a MATID effect, how many children are affected, what is
the magnitude of the effect and what does it mean? Lastly,
as mentioned earlier, and related to the previous issue,
developmental MATID effects must be understood in the
context of the child's overall development. This means
understanding protective and resiliency factors as well as
risk factors, and viewing drugs as one of a number of
events that will determine the developmental outcome of
the child. This will help enable us to develop interven-
tions designed to minimize risk factors and maximize pro-
tective factors.
Policy options
Importance of context
Context is always important for social policy, but in the
case of drug abuse during pregnancy, context is important
in several different ways. First, policy is, by definition,
dependent on social context. As was clear from our histor-
ical review, the social context for prenatal drug exposure
changed dramatically in the mid-1980's with the crack
epidemic. Social consternation with the high level of use
by pregnant women centered on consequences for the
children and then shifted to the fetus. Once the fetus
became the central protagonist there was a significant
shift in social perception. The concept of harming the
fetus by using drugs during pregnancy resulted in sanc-
tions by both the criminal justice system and the child
protective system.
Second, existing policies have been made in a climate of
scientific uncertainly about the effects of prenatal drug
exposure. Policies looking for a "quick fix" have taken a
linear approach by focusing on the single risk factor of
prenatal drug exposure as the explanation for the out-
comes of these children. However, as we will show later,
there is a wide variation in the developmental outcome of
these children, and the determinants of development in
these children are multifaceted and complex. Drug effects
must be understood in the context in which the child
develops. Parenting and other environmental factors in
addition to drugs are responsible for the outcome of these
children. Poverty (which can be a proxy for an inadequate
environment) affects IQ without drugs. The combination
of drugs and poverty can be a "double whammy" and put
children at extreme disadvantage [91]. Policy must take
into account the fact that biological vulnerability and
environmental factors interact to determine the outcome
of these children, and this is a dynamic process [134].
Third, context is also important because social policy in
this area brings up many ethical dilemmas. In the "real
world," drug-using pregnant women are mostly poor and
minority. The social policy context for these women
includes dramatic reductions in services and access to
legal recourse. In the real world, child rearing is also
affected by context, including culture. Drug-using moth-
ers may want "the best" for their children, but what they
mean by "best" will be influenced by their context, expe-
rience and belief systems and may differ from what the
experts mean by "best." And "best" needs to be weighted
against the alternative. Foster placement, especially multi-
ple foster placements, is not necessarily a better alternative
for the child. Pragmatic recognition of how these women
are treated by policies is necessary to enlarge the frame
and alter the construction of the problem.
Fourth, to say that policy is dependent on social context
also means that policy is shaped by public perception and
attitudes. One of the consequences of shattering the pla-
cental barrier, triggered primarily in response to the use of
cocaine by pregnant women in the 1980s, has been two
parallel sets of attitudes towards drug use during preg-
nancy resulting in two parallel sets of policy responses.
One approach is to view drug abuse as a mental health/
medical illness. Advocates of this approach recommend
policy that emphasizes treatment and prevention includ-
ing reproductive health care, therapy for past abuse and
for parent child relationships. The other approach is puni-
tive and views drug-using women as criminals and as irre-
sponsible ("how could they do this to their babies?"). This
approach translates into sanctions within both the crimi-
nal justice system and the child protection system. The
new twist was the construct of harming the fetus by using
drugs. The cocaine problem shone the spotlight on this
issue and it has now intensified concern about other drugs
as well including marijuana, alcohol and tobacco. For
example, if "harm" to the fetus is no worse for cocaine
than it is for legal substances such as tobacco and alcohol,
should the same criminal and treatment policies apply for
use of all these substances? It is important to point out
that for many advocates of the sanction approach, treat-
ment is included. The two approaches may not agree on
issues such as the nature of addiction, autonomy of the
pregnant woman, status of the fetus, and utility of puni-
tive measures; they do agree that treatment is an essential
component of the policy response [135].
Views of addiction
There is much societal debate on what should be the
appropriate response to maternal substance abuse during
pregnancy. One reason for the ongoing controversy is tied
to the conflicting views of addiction, and again an histor-
ical perspective is useful. Society's approach to substance
use has changed markedly over the decades from being
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5
Page 12 of 44
(page number not for citation purposes)
viewed as an individual problem for which society has no
responsibility to a major social problem that must be
addressed by the mental health, medical and criminal jus-
tice systems. For example, fifty years ago, a person seeking
help for a serious alcohol or drug problem would have
been treated for months in a psychiatric hospital diag-
nosed using the American Psychiatric Association's Grey-
book (APA 1942) as a character disorder along with
stuttering and bed wetting. Today people with substance
abuse disorder have a better chance of being identified
and finding support and/or being required by the crimi-
nal justice system to undergo treatment. Alcohol and
Drug Abuse are now distinct psychiatric (DSM-IV) disor-
ders; treatment is specialized and more often outpatient.
Today this issue tends to get polarized, especially when it
comes to pregnant women. There is the liberal perspective
of drug abuse that calls on people to look at drug use as a
public health problem requiring compassion and under-
standing. To deal with drug use during pregnancy in a
harsh way would be unconstitutional, misogynistic, and
ineffective [70]. From this perspective, drug use during
pregnancy must be treated in the same manner as depres-
sion or other mental illness. It has also been suggested
that not only is it ineffective to treat drug and alcohol
addiction as a criminal act, but it is also a punitive
approach that is akin to criminalizing mental illness
[136,137]. The opposing conservative view of drug use
during pregnancy is that it is a voluntary and illegal act
that requires significant neglect of the rights of the fetus.
From this view women who use drugs during their preg-
nancy are willfully committing a criminal act, deserving a
legal response [138].
While the pendulum has swung back and forth between
viewing addiction as a medical problem or viewing it as a
criminal problem, the highest levels of the judicial system
have made their perspective clear. As early as 1925, the
United States Supreme Court recognized addiction to be a
disease. In the Linder decision, the justices state,
"...addicts...are diseased and proper subjects for such
(medical) treatments" [139]. The Court reaffirmed this
opinion in the 1962 decision in the case of Robinson v.
California. The Court stated, "...It is unlikely that any state
at this moment in history would attempt to make it a
criminal offense for a person to be mentally ill, or a leper,
or to be afflicted with a venereal disease...in light of con-
temporary human knowledge, a law which made a crimi-
nal offense of such a disease would doubtless be
universally thought to be an infliction of cruel and unu-
sual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Four-
teenth Amendments...the prosecution is aimed at
penalizing an illness, rather than providing medical care
for it. We would forget the teachings of the Eighth Amend-
ment if we allowed sickness to be made a crime and per-
mitted sick people to be punished for being sick..."
From a medical perspective addiction is a chronic disease
[140-143]. A medical dictionary defines disease as: "any
deviation from or interruption of the normal structure or
function of any part of an organ or system (or combina-
tion thereof) of the body that is manifested by a character-
istic set of symptoms and signs, whose etiology,
pathology and prognosis may be known or unknown."
The vagueness of this definition illustrates the broad range
of conditions that are called disease, and also that whether
or not a particular condition is called a disease could be
due to cultural consensus as much as medical factors. This
social stigma probably plays a major role in addiction not
being viewed as a disease.
Prosecution and state statutes
There are many different reasons why state legislatures
have taken an interest in addressing the problem of sub-
stance abuse by pregnant women. One reason is the basic
notion that the state has an obligation to provide for the
welfare of its citizens. It is also of financial importance to
the state to address the issue [144]. Immediate effects of
MATID use include pregnancy complications as well as
health issues for the newborn, driving up the amount of
money that the state must spend on obstetrical and neo-
natal care. This is not where the cost of maternal drug use
ends for the state. After birth, children born to mothers
who used substances during pregnancy are at a higher risk
of neglect, abuse, and abandonment, thus requiring the
intervention of child protective services or juvenile courts
at further cost to the states [145]. First year costs to states
of births affected by maternal substance use can be as high
as $50,000 each above the cost of "usual" births. State
expenses for public assistance and foster care for each year
after the first can be as high as $20,000 [146].
The costs to the state coupled with media attention as a
result of the "crack baby" epidemic of the 1980s, forced
states to respond. Most often the response came in the
form of legislation [147]. Many different types of bills
were introduced in an attempt to combat the problem on
many different fronts and levels. Some bills addressed the
roles of health professionals; specifically, these bills often
required doctors to report incidents of maternal substance
abuse to the proper authorities; others required social
service agencies to assess families affected by alcohol or
drugs for abuse and neglect; and other bills introduced the
requirement of commercial vendors who sell alcohol and
tobacco to post warnings about the effects of these sub-
stances on pregnant women [148].

State approaches to maternal substance use
States have employed a wide variety of strategies to com-
bat maternal perinatal alcohol and drug use. Due to the
public's outcry for an answer to the problem of "crack
babies" and other drug-exposed infants, the courts imple-
mented policies and practices that emphasized personal
responsibility and punishment [1]. User accountability
was stated as the basis for most drug control policies. User
accountability was based on the idea that if there were no
drug users, there would be no drug problems, and that
users were responsible for creating the demand that made
trafficking a lucrative criminal enterprise [149]. Of course,
our cultural penchant for punishment and criminaliza-
tion may have played a role in justifying these policies.
Since there were not, and still are not, any statutes on the
books specifically criminalizing drug use during preg-
nancy, women have been prosecuted under statutes that
deal with child abuse, assault, murder, or drug dealing
[150]. One of the newest attempts in prosecuting women
is using statutes related to the delivery of drugs to a minor.
However, it is much more difficult to convince a judge
and jury of prosecuting on these grounds because there is
no explicit language in any statute delineating that a fetus
can be considered a minor, entitled to all the rights and
privileges afforded thereto [151,152].
Prosecutorial strategies
Since 1985, approximately 240 women in thirty states
have been criminally prosecuted in relation to their use of
drugs during pregnancy [71]. State supreme courts have
overturned nearly all these convictions. Prosecutorial
attempts fall under a few general types of criminal stat-
utes. There are statutes that deal with the delivery of a con-
trolled substance to a minor, statutes that attempt to hold
mothers who use drugs accountable under child abuse
statutes, those that charge mothers with manslaughter
should the baby die, and those related to involuntary
detention and treatment of the mother [153].
Delivery of a controlled substance to a minor
In light of the lack of specific criminal statues applying to
maternal substance abuse during pregnancy, state prose-
cutors have come up with creative ways of dealing with
the issue. One such creative method is prosecuting under
statutes that govern the delivery of a controlled substance
to a minor. Prosecutions in these cases focus on the
minute after birth before the umbilical cord is cut. At that
moment the child is fully born, and thus a person under
the Fourteenth Amendment entitled to full and equal pro-
tection under the law. At the same time the child is still
attached to the mother and could possibly be receiving
drugs through the bloodstream [20,153,154].
Arguably the most renowned case prosecuted in this man-
ner is that of Florida v. Johnson [155]. Jennifer Johnson
was convicted in Seminole County, Florida of delivering a
controlled substance to her baby through the umbilical
cord after birth. The conviction came after hospital offi-
cials discovered that her two children had positive toxicol-
ogy results for cocaine following birth. Johnson also
admitted to smoking crack cocaine three to four times
every other day throughout the course of her pregnancy.
Johnson was convicted and sentenced to 15 years proba-
tion. In 1992, the Florida Supreme Court overturned her
conviction on the basis that the statute was not meant to
apply to the delivery of controlled substances through the
umbilical cord (Florida Supreme Court, 1992).
Child abuse
The most common strategy employed is charging preg-
nant drug users with child abuse and/or neglect. The chal-
lenge facing prosecutors is finding a way to convince the
court that an unborn child falls under the legal definition
of "child" and thus deserves protection [153,156]. The
earliest prosecution using child abuse and neglect statutes
was the 1977 case of Reyes v. California. In this case the
mother gave birth to heroin-addicted twins. Ms. Reyes was
convicted under child endangerment laws. However, the
conviction was overturned and the case dismissed by the
appellate courts on the grounds that child endangerment
laws were never intended by the legislature to apply to
fetuses. Thus in the eyes of the law a fetus was not really
considered a child [157].
Cases tried using abuse and neglect statutes revolve
around the central issues of whether or not the fetus can
be considered a "child" in the eyes of the law, and whether
or not the behavior of the mother prior to the birth of the
child can be considered viable criteria for judging whether
abuse or neglect has occurred. Even given these issues,
many convictions have been obtained using these stat-
utes. While convictions under these statutes have been
overturned in higher courts of appeal, the high courts
have also suggested that states take the initiative to pass
pieces of legislation that specify prenatal maternal con-
duct as admissible in establishing abuse, or legislation
that establishes the personhood of the fetus [149,150].
Manslaughter
Another form of prosecutorial strategy that states may
employ is charging the pregnant drug user with man-
slaughter. Manslaughter statutes are difficult to apply to
the cases of pregnant women because the statutes were
intended for third party criminal culpability. This means
that manslaughter laws were originally intended to cover
the death of a baby as the result of the actions of a third
party [153,157,158]. An example of this is the Florida
criminal code which states that the willful killing of an
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5
Page 14 of 44
(page number not for citation purposes)
unborn child, by any injury to the mother of such child, is
murder if it resulted in the death of such mother, to be
deemed manslaughter, a second degree felony [159].
Despite these laws, there have been cases in which women
with babies stillborn to mothers in their third trimester
were charged with manslaughter. This prosecutorial strat-
egy has seldom been employed and has never resulted in
a conviction. It is doubtful whether manslaughter charges
would ever actually result in a conviction for a drug-using
mother if tested in a jury trial. It is even more unlikely that
the charge would be upheld in higher courts of appeal.
The case law does not lend itself to the legal conception of
the fetus as a person with independent legal rights sepa-
rate from those of the mother. When cocaine mothers
have been convicted of manslaughter, it was the result of
their guilty pleas without the deliberation of public trials
[22].
Involuntary detention
In an attempt to decriminalize drug use in pregnant
women, involuntary detention in treatment programs has
been offered as an alternative. It has been argued that
involuntary detention is the best available mode of
administering punishment, rehabilitation, and deterrence
all at once, as well as providing the addict with education
and protection for the infant [160,161]. The trend in
states is to move toward reducing the severity of the effects
of drug use on the infant. According to The New York
Times, when doctors specializing in maternal-fetal medi-
cine were surveyed in 1986, more than half of them
agreed that pregnant women who refuse medical advice
and endanger the life of the fetus should be detained in
hospitals and forced to follow their physician's orders
[160]. By committing the pregnant drug user without her
consent, the state is essentially taking custody of the child
before it is ever born. This presents a legal and ethical con-
flict. By involuntarily committing the mother as a mode of
protecting the infant, the court is, in some respect, putting
the needs and the health of the child over those of the
mother. There is an understood obligation to the mother's
health and well being, but with involuntary detention, the
health and well being of the fetus comes first, even though
this is not a legally recognized obligation [150].
Civil interventions
With the waning popularity of criminal prosecutions
against perinatal substance abusers, states have turned
toward civil legal remedies. These actions are both more
pervasive and more successful than criminal prosecutions.
This is largely because in order to establish a prosecution
against someone the state must prove that the defendant
is guilty of the alleged crime beyond a reasonable doubt.
In civil actions the state is only obligated to prove there is
a preponderance of evidence to suggest the guilt of the
accused [149].
Child neglect statutes
Civil actions in regard to child abuse and neglect provide
a basis for which social welfare agencies, especially child
protective agencies, can intervene and conduct investiga-
tions into the fitness of a parent [149,162]. While criminal
child abuse and neglect statutes seek to punish the parents
for their failure to properly care for their children, civil
child neglect statutes seek to intervene in the family set-
ting in an attempt to introduce plans of action for rehabil-
itating the parent and restoring normal order to the family
unit [22,161]. Civil actions are established in the same
way as criminal child abuse cases. They are most often
based on the results of toxicology screens performed on
the child at the time of birth. There are questions today on
whether a positive toxicology screen is enough to estab-
lish neglect, remove the child from the home, and ulti-
mately terminate parental rights. The general "rules" the
courts have established in deciding these cases are that
children have the right to be born with a sound mind and
body and past evidence of neglect and abuse is relevant in
determining future harm [147].
Involuntary civil commitment
Civil commitment is a civil action with state intervention
that places individuals in some type of inpatient facility
against their will after the state has demonstrated they are
dangerous or unable to meet their most basic needs or
both [149]. This type of intervention has been widely used
against substance abusers, however only one state has suc-
cessfully included pregnant women in the statutes that
call for involuntary commitment.
Tort actions
Tort actions are civil actions that are filed by an independ-
ent party on behalf of the fetus [147,149]. These actions
are meant to deter drug use by imposing financial conse-
quences on the drug-using mother. In tort actions women
are held accountable for the financial burden incurred for
the cost of the birth of the drug-exposed baby.
State statutes
In formulating laws, whether criminal or civil, pertaining
to perinatal substance abuse, there are certain general cat-
egories that are adhered to. There are laws dealing with the
termination of parental rights and the removal of children
from the home, testing/reporting/ identifying drug-
exposed infants, child abuse, and treatment for the
mother and alcohol. Figure 2 shows the number of states
with laws in each of these categories. Table 2 shows which
states have specific laws and Table 3 (see Additional File
1) provides a summary of the specific laws.
Child abuse and neglect
More than one-quarter of the states have passed laws that
specifically define a mother's drug use as child abuse or

neglect. Thus by defining maternal drug use as an act of
child abuse, these states are insuring serious consequences
for the mothers, including criminal prosecution, removal
of the child(ren) from the home, and termination of
parental rights. Every state has laws mandating reporting
of child abuse [163]. Thus in the states where drug use is
defined as child abuse, reporting of the abuse to the
proper authorities is also mandated.
Termination of parental rights/removal from the home
A major reason women do not disclose their drug use and
seek treatment is because they fear their children will be
removed from their homes and their rights may be alto-
gether terminated. This is not an unfounded fear. Sixteen
states have enacted laws that allow for the removal of a
child from the home based on various factors, including a
positive toxicology screen at the time of birth, or a con-
firmed report of drug use in the home. After the child has
been removed from the home, child protective services is
obligated under ASFA 1997 to move quickly in ensuring
that the parent has the opportunity to obtain treatment
for their addiction through a court-formulated service
plan. Noncompliance can result in termination of paren-
tal rights and adoption of the child.
Testing/reporting/identification
While every state in the country has mandatory reporting
laws for child abuse and neglect, not every state has laws
concerning testing/reporting/identification of pregnant
and postpartum substance users. This is because not every
state specifically defines drug use during pregnancy as
child abuse or neglect. Given this fact, there are still a sig-
nificant number of states, 17, that have laws specifically
related to prenatal substance exposure. These laws range
from mandating toxicology tests for infants of mothers
suspected of using drugs, toxicology tests for the mother
herself, to reporting the findings of any positive toxicol-
ogy screen to the proper authorities, whether that be the
police department or child protective services [164].
Criminal offenses vs. treatment
One of the most pressing questions among social service
professionals today is whether maternal substance abuse
warrants treatment or criminalization. The states also
struggle with this question in formulating laws. Many
states are leaning towards treating the mother. In fact, no
less than one quarter of the states have laws in place man-
dating state establishment of treatment programs for
expectant and parenting women who are also substance
abusers. The state of California has enacted a law mandat-
ing an alternative sentencing program that combines
treatment with criminal consequences for noncompli-
ance. Under Cal. Pen. Code 1174.4, pregnant women
with an established history of substance abuse, or preg-
nant or parenting women with an established history of
substance abuse who have one or more children under the
age of 6 are eligible to enter a drug treatment program,
coupled with one year of transition services under inten-
sive parole supervision. Should they complete the pro-
gram they will be discharged from parole. If they do not
complete the program, they will be returned to state
prison to complete their original sentence.
Alcohol policy
Given the fact that alcohol is a legal substance in this
country, it is difficult for states to enact laws criminalizing
it for pregnant women. As long as they are over the age of
21, pregnant women are free to drink. However seven
states do have laws in place requiring establishments that
sell alcohol to post warnings about the dangers of drink-
ing while pregnant [164].
The information in Tables 2-3 suggests that as a nation we
do not have a uniform policy for dealing with drug use
during pregnancy. State statues are quite varied ranging
from no policies to strictly punitive policies. For some
states, drug use during pregnancy equals child abuse
(Iowa, South Carolina, Tennessee, Florida). Other states
(Maryland, New York) are more vague and include treat-
ment options. For example, Missouri grants pregnant
women priority at drug treatment centers and Washington
only requires an investigation. States also vary with
respect to the definition of "drug." For example, some
states (Maryland, Iowa, Oregon, Idaho, Illinois) only
mention illegal drugs or controlled substances and not
alcohol.
Policies for newborn drug testing, including conditions
under which a drug screen can be ordered, and mandatory
reporting also vary from state to state. Some states (e.g.,

Massachusetts, Arizona, Minnesota) require mandatory
reporting to CPS following a positive drug screen; Colo-
rado "encourages" but does require reporting; and other
states (e.g., California, Kentucky) evaluate and determine
if further investigation is necessary. In California, a posi-
tive toxicology screen is not in and of itself a sufficient rea-
son to report; further assessment of the needs of the
mother and child are required.
Foster care
Maternal drug use impacts directly on the foster care sys-
tem. In the mid-1970s, there were over half a million chil-
dren in substitute care in this country. There was concern
with child welfare programs and in 1980 the concept of
"permanency planning" was codified into law. By 1985,
the foster care population dropped by almost 50%. But
permanency planning was ultimately ineffective and in
1995 the number of children in substitute care had risen
again to nearly 500,000. The number of children under
five years of age is increasing at twice the national rate of
the general foster care population. This dramatic increase
in the number of children in foster care from the late
1980's through the 1990's is due in large part to increased
drug use among women, particularly cocaine use among
pregnant women.
Substance use during pregnancy not only raises questions
about the options for the drug-using women, treatment
considerations, and the medical and developmental out-
come of the infant, but also about the placement of the
drug-exposed infant. There have been substantial reports
of the effects of prenatal substance exposure upon both
medical and developmental outcomes of the infant. Aris-
ing from this is the perception of drug-using mothers
being unable to care for their children, thus propelling
social service agencies to intervene and remove the child
from the mother's custody.
The increased need for foster care homes has created a lack
of available foster homes for these infants. The fear of
detection, incarceration, and child removal associated
with reported drug use drives women away from the
health care system for prenatal care and from seeking
treatment for their substance abuse problems. Thus, there
is an increase in the number of "boarder babies."
Boarder babies
"Boarder babies" are at-risk infants (typically drug-
exposed) in the custody of Child Protective Services (CPS)
who remain in the hospital beyond the date of medical
discharge, i.e., they do not require any special medical
care but stay in the hospital because they are awaiting
placement decisions or because placement options are
sparse. The "boarder baby" problem is tied to the crimi-
nalization of mothers with infants who are prenatally
drug exposed and to a decrease in the availability of
appropriate foster homes [165].
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services esti-
mated that there were 9,700 "boarder babies" nationwide
in 1991 [166]. For this study "boarder babies" were
defined as infants younger than 12 months of age who
remain in the hospital beyond the date of medical dis-
charge. Almost one-fourth stayed from 21 to over 100
days beyond medical discharge. "Boarder babies" place
increased demands on both the health care system and
the child welfare system. A second study recently reported
1998 estimates and showed 13,400 boarder babies
nationwide. This represents a 38% increase in the boarder
baby population between 1991 and 1998. The majority
was African American, although the percentage of African
American boarder babies was less in 1998 (56%) than in
1991 (75%).
Although the total number of boarder babies increased by
1998, there was a change in the geographic distribution of
these infants. In 1991, three jurisdictions (New York City,
Cook County, Chicago and Los Angeles County)
accounted for 47% of the boarder baby population. By
1998, boarder babies in these three jurisdictions
decreased 21% and increased by 90% in the rest of the
nation. Hospital staff in the three jurisdictions attributed
the decrease in the boarder baby population to improved
efforts by the child welfare agencies and hospitals to more
promptly identify alternative placements for these chil-
dren. The per diem cost for boarder baby care rose 17%
from $476 in 1991 to $570 in 1998. Positive findings
were that from 1991 to 1998, the mean length of stay for
boarder babies beyond the point of medical discharge
decreased from 22 days to 9 days, and the percent residing
in hospitals for more than 21 days decreased from 24% to
12%. Also over this period the percent of premature
infants decreased from 47% to 35%, and the percent low
birthweight decreased from 57% to 33%.
Sixty-five percent of these infants were tested for drug
exposure in 1991; 82% were tested in 1998. In 1991, 79%
of those tested were positive for drugs. Drug exposure has
been the most common reason for keeping babies in the
hospital, with crack/cocaine as the most prevalent drug
accounting for 71% of the cases. The number of boarder
babies discharged to out of home placement was 66% in
1991 and 70% in 1998. The most common placement
was foster care (59% and 57% in 1991 and 1998 respec-
tively). Relative foster care was 14% and 12% in 1991 and
1998.
Abandoned infants
Although the terms "boarder babies" and "abandoned
infants" are often used interchangeably, and both are
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5
Page 18 of 44
(page number not for citation purposes)
related to prenatal drug exposure, they are differentiated
by the Federal government. Boarder babies may eventu-
ally be claimed by their families or abandoned and/or
placed in alternative care. Abandoned infants are under
the age of 12 months, and have not yet been medically
discharged but who are unlikely to leave the hospital in
the custody of their biological parent(s). This includes
infants whose parents are unwilling or unable to provide
care and/or whom the child welfare agency determines
cannot safely remain in the care of their biological par-
ent(s). Abandoned infants are viewed as "potential
boarder babies" whose living arrangements were resolved
prior to the time of medical discharge. Obviously, infants
removed from their biological parent(s) due to maternal
drug use during pregnancy fit into this category.
The survey also queried hospitals in those jurisdictions
with a boarder baby problem about the number of aban-
doned infants. In 1998, there were 17,400 abandoned
infants in these hospitals compared to 11,900 in 1991, an
increase of 46%. They were mostly African American
(67% in 1991 and 48% in 1998) and mostly premature or
low birthweight in both years. The percent of infants pos-
itive for a drug was 78% in 1991 and 72% in 1998 and
Cocaine was the drug in 70% of the cases in both years.
Unlike the boarder babies, there was no change in the
average length of stay for abandoned infants; the average
was 34 days in both 1991 and 1998. Out of home place-
ment was 68% and 58% in 1991 and 1998.
Foster care and child outcome
Infants placed in foster care because of illegal drug expo-
sure have more health and caregiving needs than non-
exposed infants placed in foster care [167]. Drug-exposed
infants were more likely to have conditions such as ane-
mia, asthma, small size, and feeding, sleep, and behavior
problems. Other research has shown that intrauterine
drug exposure predisposes infants to poorer outcomes
such as low birthweight and delayed cognitive or motor
development. Although research also suggests that the
effects of intrauterine substance exposure may be subtle
and most health care professionals may not consider the
needs of these infants severe, they do place more demands
upon the caregivers of these infants. Many caregivers feel
they are ill equipped to care for drug-exposed infants.
They do not understand the subtle needs of drug-exposed
infants and therefore fear they will not be able to manage
their care. These needs place additional demands on the
foster family and thus the concerns of not being able to
meet those needs contribute to the lack of placements for
drug-exposed infants.
Even when foster care placements are available, foster par-
ents of infants prenatally exposed to drugs have a higher
"burnout" rate [168]; that is, they choose to return the
baby more often than if the baby is not drug-exposed.
They face a lack of supportive services. Interestingly, adop-
tive parents of infants whose drug exposure status was
unknown to them expected the easiest time in caring for
their children [169]. However, with regards to satisfac-
tion, there was no difference between those families
adopting substance-exposed infants as compared to those
adopting infants not exposed to illegal drugs.
Infants that test positive at birth are more likely to be
placed in foster care [170]. They are also more likely to
have siblings in foster care and their mothers are more
likely to have previous involvement with CPS. Infants
exposed to drugs prenatally are also likely to be placed in
kinship (relative foster) care but receive fewer visits from
their biological parents [167]. Yet, these same families do
not receive significantly enhanced services. One pressing
issue is that the problems associated with infant outcome
are influenced by other factors pertaining to maternal
drug use such as poor health, nutrition, depression, pov-
erty and the postnatal environment of these infants. From
this arises the question of which needs and services are
being considered when the infant is placed. All issues sur-
rounding drug addiction (treatment, lack of support,
finances) seem to negatively impact upon parenting.
Abused or neglected children are at risk for developing
poor attachments to their caregivers. The emotional con-
sequences of multiple placements should be considered
in the placement of infants.
In a study to determine factors that affect the nature of
legal custody and placement, MacMahon [171] studied
the outcome of infants who were dependents of the court
at discharge from the hospital. Court-ordered services for
the mothers differed, although most were required to
attend a drug rehab program, undergo random drug test-
ing, and receive public health nurse visits. Other families
were required to attend psychological counseling and
parenting education classes. Those infants reunited with
their biological mothers in their first year of life had older
mothers, had received some prenatal care, did not have
previous involvement with CPS, and had mothers who
had not had any other children removed from them. Two
factors related to a parent never receiving custody of the
child were the mother's previous involvement with CPS,
and having previously lost custody of her child. Since
some mothers were not able to comply with court-ordered
drug treatment and had positive urine screens, they did
not receive full custody of their infants. The MacMahon
study showed that court-ordered monitoring of required
services can help with permanency decisions. Yet, this
raises questions about the additional supportive services
necessary for these families.
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5

Increased communication between the agencies that pro-
vide care to these at risk infants and families is critical
[170]. Coordinated case management can decrease obsta-
cles to services [172]. The increased healthcare risks of
these infants suggest the need for more intensive interven-
tions and training. A comprehensive and multidiscipli-
nary approach to the care of these infants seems warranted
[167,173]. Thorough assessment of the infants that
includes an evaluation of developmental areas such as
motor, cognition, language, self help skills, coping skills,
and emotional well being should be conducted at regular
intervals after placement in foster care. In addition, an
assessment of the caregiver's parenting skills should be
conducted. Helping both biological and foster parents
understand the child's needs and capabilities is crucial in
trying to de-stigmatize drug-exposed children [174]. Inter-
ventions should include biological and foster parents
when appropriate. Having the biological mother attend
the infant's medical or diagnostic appointments can
enhance continuity of care [167]. Longitudinal follow-up
is critical. Comparisons of infants in foster care exposed to
drugs with infants in foster care not exposed to drugs did
not show increased developmental delays in the group of
infants prenatally exposed to drugs [174]. However,
approximately half the infants in each group were at risk
for further delays, suggesting the need for long-term fol-
low up. Finally, training of foster parents is a key compo-
nent for enhancing the caregiver child relationship.
While the research is unclear about the outcome of infants
exposed to drugs, the research concerning those infants
placed in foster care stresses the importance of coordi-
nated, comprehensive, and intense interventions and
monitoring. It is understood that the needs of infants pre-
natally exposed to drugs include consistent monitoring.
More studies are needed to evaluate the longitudinal out-
come of these proposed services.
Adoption and safe families act (ASFA)
Growing national concern regarding too many children
who linger in foster care led to the passage of the Adop-
tion and Safe Families Act (ASFA). ASFA was signed into
law on November 19, 1997 and puts into place the most
extensive changes in federal child welfare policy since the
Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980. ASFA
seeks to provide the states with the necessary tools and
incentives to achieve the original goals of Public Law 96-
27: safety, permanency, and child and family well being.
The impetus for ASFA was the general dissatisfaction with
the performance of state level child welfare systems in
achieving these goals for children and families. ASFA
seeks to strengthen the child welfare system's response to
a child's need for safety and permanency at every point
along the continuum of care.
In part, the law places safety as the paramount concern in
the delivery of child welfare services and decision-making,
clarifies when efforts to prevent removal or to reunify a
child with his or her family are not required, and requires
criminal record checks of prospective foster and adoptive
parents. To promote permanency, ASFA shortens the time
frames for conducting hearings, creates a new requirement
for states to make reasonable efforts to finalize a perma-
nent placement, and establishes time frames for filing
petitions to terminate the parental rights for certain chil-
dren in foster care.
ASFA requires child welfare agencies to pay heightened
attention to children's well-being and safety and to their
needs for permanent families, and is founded on five key
concepts: (1) the child's health and safety "shall be the
paramount concern" in determining what efforts should
be made to reunify families, (2) in "aggravated circum-
stances" as defined in State law reunification services to
families are not required (3) when no reunification serv-
ices to families are required, the child needs a quick, alter-
native permanent placement, (4) in all other cases,
services to families need to be improved and accelerated
and, (5) in all cases, permanency ­ whether the goal is to
return home, adoption, legal guardianship, or legal cus-
tody with a fit and willing relative ­ needs to be expedited.
Under ASFA, a permanency hearing must be held in Fam-
ily Court 12 months after the child enters foster care and
at 12-month intervals thereafter. For ASFA, the date that a
child enters foster care is defined as either: 1) sixty-days
after the child is removed from the home, or 2) the date
that the child is found by a Court to be an abused or
neglected child, whichever is earlier. At the hearing, the
Family Court judge must determine whether and when
the child will be either returned to the birth parents,
placed for adoption, referred for legal guardianship,
placed with a fit and willing relative, or placed in another
planned permanent living arrangement.
In order to ensure that children do not linger indefinitely
in foster care, ASFA creates a presumption that a petition
to terminate parental rights must be filed, and concur-
rently steps to finalize an adoptive placement must be ini-
tiated in the following three circumstances: Where a child
has been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months, OR
where a court has determined a child to be an abandoned
infant, OR where a parent has committed certain crimes
against the child or a sibling (i.e., murder, manslaughter,
attempted murder or manslaughter, or a felony assault
resulting in serious bodily injury to the child or another
child of the parent).
Although ASFA creates the presumption that certain cate-
gories of foster children should be freed and adopted
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5

quickly, it also creates three grounds for exceptions to that
presumption: (1) at the option of the State, the child is
being cared for by a relative, (2) a State agency has docu-
mented in the case plan (available for court review) a
compelling reason for determining that filing a TPR peti-
tion would not be in the best interests of the child, or (3)
the state has not provided to the family of the child, con-
sistent with the time period in the State case plan, such
services as the State deems necessary for the safe return of
the child to the child's home if reasonable efforts to
reunify the family are required.
Barriers to treatment
The overriding feeling among policy makers and social
welfare agencies is that preserving the family is important
where at all possible. This view has been reinforced by
ASFA. Substance use is not always a clear indicator of a
parent's lack of commitment to their child. In fact many
drug users are committed to being parents. One large bar-
rier to seeking treatment is that the substance addict is
afraid that if they seek help they will lose their children
[175]. While the main goal of civil interventions is to pro-
tect children rather than punish mothers, many women
view them as the state trying to take their children. Thus
agencies have taken steps to make removing children
from their homes the last resort. If this cannot be
achieved, the next goal is family reunification and often
the success of a program is measured by how effectively
the program preserves the family.
Thus in an attempt to preserve the family, the preferred
method of state intervention has become treatment and
rehabilitation. There has been little consensus over the
years on the best methods to employ in treating pregnant
women with substance abuse problems. While treatment
is recognized as the best method of addressing the issue,
there are many problems that plague it that have made it
difficult to implement on a large scale. These problems
include a shortage of drug treatment programs, the resist-
ance of drug treatment programs to including pregnant
women, lack of consensus on the most effective method
of treatment, cost, and whether treatment should be vol-
untary or forced [176,177].
The reluctance of drug treatment programs to accept preg-
nant women is a large problem that has plagued the treat-
ment approach to state intervention. In trying to
understand this phenomenon it is important to note that
historically drug treatment programs have exhibited a
reluctance and insensitivity to addicted women in general.
In the early 1970s the National Institute on Drug Abuse
began research that targeted women addicts. In the treat-
ment programs they surveyed, they found that male staff
and participants were openly hostile to women clients,
employed a confrontational "therapeutic" style uncom-
fortable for women, and directed them into gender-stere-
otyped tasks and training which offered minimal
compensation or chance for success after completion of
the program. The programs also failed to address many
issues that played a strong role in female drug addiction.
These issues included the environments of violence and
sexual exploitation in which the women often live. The
programs provided no provision for the care of the
women's children and also included no contraceptive and
prenatal medical services [86,175,178]. This all but
ensured lack of participation by pregnant women in estab-
lished programs.
Reviews of the literature with regard to chemical depend-
ency reveal that as a group the female user has been over-
looked. Research also shows the lack of availability of
treatment programs for women, specifically pregnant or
child-bearing women. In 1976, Public Law 94-371 gave
consideration to the funding of women's treatment and
prevention programs [179]. Still, programs frequently
overlook the special needs of the female user. Historically,
in studies that examined treatment outcomes, approxi-
mately half of these studies included women, whereas a
very small number focused on women alone. Studies that
included pregnant women are even fewer. Those that do
include this population focus mainly on birth outcome of
the baby or early infant development, and very little focus
was placed on treatment issues for women, or treatment
outcome [180]. Finkelstein [181,182] noted that drug-
using women tend to be younger and are more likely to be
pregnant than the typical female client found in alcohol-
ism treatment centers.
States have used a variety of approaches to address prob-
lems created by prenatal substance use. These approaches
include criminal prosecution of the mother, civil interven-
tion by child protective service agencies, and public health
initiatives providing education, intervention, and treat-
ment. Some states are combining approaches by creating
"drug courts" (discussed later) that mandate treatment
and/or jail time. However, at this time, no state has made
pregnant drug addiction illegal, per se. Instead, states have
applied statutes dealing with child abuse, assault, drug
dealing to a minor, etc., to pregnant women who use
drugs. In fact, the Supreme Court recently ruled that it is
illegal for birthing hospitals to provide law enforcement
agencies the results of drug screens performed in the hos-
pital. It is unconstitutional for hospital workers to test
maternity patients for illegal drug use if the purpose is to
alert the police to a crime [183].
As mentioned earlier, 16 states consider alcohol or drug
use during pregnancy sufficient grounds for an investiga-
tion of parental fitness and/or removal of the children
from the home. Because of this, women using substances
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5
Page 21 of 44
(page number not for citation purposes)
during their pregnancy are often reluctant to seek help.
The National Women's Resource Center also reports that
women are unwilling to be separated from their children
for long therapeutic interventions and fear losing custody
more than criminal prosecution. Yet, Hser et al. [184]
reports that legal pressure is a strong predictor of entry
into treatment.
The financial cost of treatment is high. The National Asso-
ciation of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors found
that in 1997, states spent approximately $2 billion on
treatment programs and the federal government contrib-
uted approximately $1.5 billion more. Funding for these
treatment programs came from such sources as The Sub-
stance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block
Grant, which mandates that 5% of the grant must be allo-
cated for pregnant women unless the state can demon-
strate that the needs of pregnant users are already being
met. Transitional Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
funds can be used for treatment if these funds are used for
non-medical services such as those provided by psycholo-
gists or social workers. Despite the availability of funds
and allocation for a variety of services, only one third of
individuals admitted to drug treatment programs were
women. Clearly, an even smaller percentage of pregnant
users are receiving treatment.
Although the financial cost of treatment is great, there is
limited information regarding the cost effectiveness of
drug treatment. One study compared hospitalization rates
for infants of two groups of women [185]. Both groups
consisted of pregnant drug-using women. One group
included women who had enrolled in a treatment pro-
gram that provided both prenatal medical and drug abuse
treatment services. The second group consisted of preg-
nant drug using women who did not undergo treatment
because it was unavailable. Infants of mothers in the
treatment groups had substantially better outcomes at
birth and were less likely to need intensive care services.
Mothers in this group also showed less drug use. Total cost
comparisons showed that even with the cost of the treat-
ment program included, the cost for intensive care serv-
ices far outweighed the cost for treatment for pregnant
drug-using women. While further cost effectiveness stud-
ies are warranted, this study indicates both the financial
and medical benefit of drug treatment.
Our meta-analysis of the effects of prenatal cocaine expo-
sure on school age children showed that special education
services for these children cost our society upwards of
$372 million per year [91]. That figure represents addi-
tional costs to society due to prenatal cocaine exposure
alone. If that money was spent on services for these moth-
ers and infants prenatally or at birth, the school age defi-
cits could be prevented or at least minimized, the children
would not have to wait for services until school age, and
therefore they would suffer less. Intervention would be
provided while the child's brain was still in the period of
most rapid growth and thus easier to change, as compared
with school age when there is less brain plasticity. In addi-
tion, there would be cost savings because the children
would not need as extensive (if any) special education
services. In a recent study of children growing up in
poverty (not drug-exposed), it was found that an increase
in economic resources of $13,400 over three years
improved social skills and school readiness (Day care
study, November CD). That's $4,466 per year compared
to the $6,335 average cost for special education services
years later once children start school [91].
One way to think about cost savings is through integrated
drug treatment. Weisner et al. [186] found that patients
with psychiatric and medical conditions linked to sub-
stance abuse can benefit from receiving their medical and
addiction care in the same treatment program, without
significant higher costs than is the case when treatments
are separate. The prevalence of medical disorders is high
among substance abuse patients but medical services are
seldom provided in coordination with substance abuse
treatment. This randomized clinical trial compared inde-
pendent delivery of substance abuse treatment with treat-
ment integrated with primary care. Patients in the
integrated services group had higher abstinence rates and
longer periods of abstinence than did patients in the inde-
pendent services group. Moreover, costs were not higher
in the integrated services group.
On the other hand, we need to be clear that policy recom-
mendations should not be based on cost-benefit analysis
alone. A sobering reminder was the Philip Morris report
that the Czech government had saved 147 million dollars
in health care, pensions and housing as a result of
premature deaths due to smoking. Drug treatment is jus-
tified because people suffer and need it regardless of
economics.
History of treatment issues
Policymakers and legislators have "led the charge" in try-
ing to curb the problem of maternal substance abuser.
However it is virtually impossible to have an impact
unless the complex legal, ethical, emotional, and moral
issues are seriously examined and overcome. Although
there has been a boom of research in what substance
exposure does to a fetus and subsequent child, there is a
considerable lack of empirical research on treatment
options for the substance-using mother [182]. At first,
there was the documented shortage of substance abuse
treatment programs, particularly for pregnant women
[182]. In fact, most traditional treatment programs were
designed primarily for men and were not appropriate for
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5
Page 22 of 44
(page number not for citation purposes)
women, especially pregnant women [187]. However, after
the evidence regarding cocaine exposure in the 1980's,
many government agencies such as the National Institute
on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the Center for Substance Abuse
Treatment (CSAT), etc., began to support treatment pro-
grams specifically designed for the pregnant or mothering
substance user. In 1989 and 1990, NIDA supported 20
research demonstration projects that focused on the treat-
ment of drug-using pregnant women. A description of
these projects, termed the Perinatal 20, in addition to sev-
eral other model programs, will be discussed later.
Despite the increased support and availability of treat-
ment programs, there exist serious barriers to treatment
for pregnant substance users. Very few treatment pro-
grams have existed for women or have used treatment
modalities designed specifically for women. Many pro-
grams have relied on male-based recovery models. These
treatment approaches followed the medical or disease
model, with a focus on the client's problem without any
regard for any other variables that may foster treatment.
This approach, focused on the individual and not the
pregnant addict within the context of her family or envi-
ronment, presents a challenge to women willing to access
treatment. For instance, it is difficult for many users to be
accepted into programs. Breitbart, Chavkin, and Wise
[188] surveyed five U.S. cities as to the availability of treat-
ment programs to pregnant women. Although the large
majority of programs did accept pregnant women (80%),
many did not accept women on Medicaid and did not
provide or arrange for childcare. Addiction treatment is
more effective when it is designed to account for women's
needs. Addiction treatment counselors find that gender-
specific treatment is much more effective than mixed-gen-
der approaches. For seriously addicted women, the most
effective treatments are long-term and residential. Also
low-income women often have a variety of other service
needs such as the need to learn parenting and career skills
[144,148,188,189].
Another barrier to treatment is identification of the target
population. Many pregnant substance users are reluctant
to admit to drug use for fear of losing custody of their chil-
dren especially in states that legally require or practice
mandatory reporting. Many of these women also fear
criminal prosecution. The fear or threat of domestic vio-
lence is another serious concern.
The stigma against a pregnant user has been discussed in
the literature. These women are frequently seen as weak
willed and negligent of their children and are often
blamed for exposing their children to drugs [190]. This in
turn has led to legal interventions such as criminal prose-
cution, mandatory treatment, and removal of custody
[144]. In addition, research has documented negative atti-
tudes towards pregnant users by treatment providers,
[182] which may make them reluctant to admit substance
use.
Another barrier to treatment is the recognized lack of
resources designed to help the pregnant addict and her
children. Staff often lack knowledge and training regard-
ing issues of pregnancy and addiction. The first challenge
is a concern over to how to medically manage these
women. Addiction to alcohol and other drugs is a bio-
chemical process. Many addicted women wish to quit
using drugs or alcohol but are physically unable to stop.
Detoxification is usually the first step in treatment. Usu-
ally this takes place is an inpatient setting and is a short
term way to eliminate chemical dependence, although it
does not treat the enduring psychological and behavioral
aspects of addiction. Since there is a fear of harming the
unborn fetus with many of the medications used for
detoxification, opiate-dependent women are especially
susceptible to this barrier. Thus, their access is limited to
most residential treatment programs. The concerns seem
to be centered around the fact that detoxification can pre-
cipitate fetal withdrawal in utero, and that there is a high
rate of recidivism among opiate-dependent individuals,
which makes it harder to keep the unborn baby away from
inconsistent levels of a drug and drug impurities. Many
programs are ill equipped to include infants and children
into the program. There is also a fear of liability for nega-
tive birth outcomes and a lack of appropriate care for the
infant and/or other children while the mother is in treat-
ment. The lack of services for both the mother and the
baby together leads to mothers being reluctant to obtain
treatment because of the amount of time spent away from
the child. All too often, it is a choice between treatment or
caring for a new infant and other children [182]. Even
though programs do not include treatment services for
children, they do not offer childcare as an alternative or
incentive to treatment. Once again, the substance user
must choose extended time away from the infant in order
to obtain help.
Such factors contribute to the low numbers of pregnant
substance users receiving medical care. When women do
receive prenatal care it provides an opportunity for inter-
vention or access to support providers. Prenatal care clin-
ics may also be a venue for screening for substance use.
Several brief screening tools have been devised that are
appropriate for individuals with minimal substance abuse
training [191]. However, many treatment programs do
not include prenatal care as a vital component.
Another barrier is the lack of coordination between the
resources needed by the pregnant substance user and lack
of personnel who are sensitive to the issues and needs of
this population. Also, many physicians are reluctant to
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5

(page number not for citation purposes)
identify the pregnant user for a variety of reasons. For
instance, they may feel that they are ill equipped to pro-
vide pregnant women with support, or they may have lit-
tle confidence in social service agencies.
Finally, women may not seek treatment because they do
not have transportation to and from programs and for
economic reasons. They may not have insurance, money
to pay for treatment, childcare, or treatment programs that
are even available to them.
Historically, the approach for drug and alcohol treatment
has been individually based, thus causing the pregnant
addict to represent two avenues for intervention. Treat-
ment professionals are often divided. First, there are those
concerned with child welfare and second, there are those
concerned with the addiction, thus leaving a clear lack of
coordinated, comprehensive, family centered treatment
[182]. Instead, a fragmented social service system stands
in the wake of this division. Funding is usually not family
centered so each service necessary in the treatment is in a
separate location with unique regulations and procedures.
Coordinating and accessing all these services becomes a
burden and thus services are not utilized. Clearly, barriers
to treatment exist for pregnant women and many pro-
grams are not providing the vital services needed for
success.
Merely accessing treatment should be considered as a
component for success. There is little definitive evidence
in the treatment literature with regard to why a client
interrupts or stops treatment. There may be differing
rationales based on the type of user, i.e., age, race, educa-
tion, gender, pregnant or parenting women. Hser et al.
[184] examined factors affecting treatment entry. Charac-
teristics that predicted treatment entry include legal pres-
sure, lower levels of psychological distress and family or
social problems, and prior successful treatment experi-
ences. Perhaps treatment programs should identify such
factors as part of their recruitment and service delivery and
create individual, family centered treatment services.
Research on treatment effectiveness
There is no clear empirical evidence as to what treatment
modality is best for substance using mothers, including
inpatient or outpatient. The limited research on treatment
programs is in part due to small sample sizes and the obvi-
ous lack of control or comparison groups. Hence, most of
the information about treatment programs is descriptive
in nature. Amidst the descriptions of these programs exists
a discussion of what is the most effective approach to
treatment. In this question lies the debate over one-step
expectation programs of immediate abstinence or pro-
grams that institute a stage process of recovery. No current
stage measure is designed specifically for substance using
populations. Prochaska and DiClemente's Transtheoreti-
cal Model of Behavior Change posits that an intervention
should fit an individual stage of readiness for change. This
stage model has been used successfully with cigarette
smokers. However, some research suggests this may not
be an appropriate model for street drug-using populations
[192,193]. Drug users who are not highly educated have
difficulty completing a lengthy questionnaire and have
difficulty with the vocabulary used within them [193].
Wing [194] proposed a four-stage model of alcohol recov-
ery that included steps for life planning and recom-
mended nursing interventions. Kearney [192] suggests
that this model may be more appropriate for substance
users because of the similarities between alcohol and drug
users, and because this model recognizes the need for
whole life restructuring required for lasting recovery.
Once again, even with the increase in treatment services
there is little empirical research on them. The outcomes
for these are usually retention in the treatment program
and/or negative drug screens or abstinence from sub-
stances. Treatment retention has been related to successful
program outcome [195]. The NIDA supported Perinatal
20 consists of twenty individual demonstration projects
located across the country. Outcome information is not
published for all of the projects as of yet, however, results
for some of the projects will be discussed below in the
context of type of treatment program.
Residential treatment programs
Camp and Finkelstein [196] investigated 170 pregnant
and parenting substance dependent women who were
placed in two residential treatment programs. In addition
to drug use, this study examined the effectiveness of
parenting component and aftercare services. Measures of
parenting skills, self-esteem, etc., were compared before
and after program participation. Birth outcomes were also
examined. Results suggest that participants improved con-
siderably in their parenting knowledge and self-esteem.
With regard to infant outcome, few infants exhibited poor
birth outcomes such as low birth weight or early gesta-
tional ages. Completion of the program resulted in longer
periods of abstinence.
The Salvation Army Treatment program in Honolulu is a
long-term residential chemical dependency treatment
facility. Women have been admitted to the program for
approximately 6 ­ 18 months either with or without their
children. Most of the women are referred to the program
by child protective services or the courts. The residents of
the program are usually single, unemployed, and have a
criminal history. Treatment plans are developed for the
mother and if needed, her child. Treatment usually
includes individual and group counseling, family groups,
practical life skills, trauma resolution groups, and parent-
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5

ing classes. The treatment team includes addiction coun-
selors, early childhood specialists, nurses, social workers,
and psychiatrists. Women enrolled in the program also
have a weekly parent child therapy session to maximize
their interaction capabilities. This program also includes a
therapeutic nursery for the children focused on develop-
mental mastery and remediation of any problems associ-
ated with prenatal drug exposure. A psychiatric day
treatment program for children aged 3­7 years who have
emotional or behavioral problems is also located on the
program's campus. This program has conducted an inter-
nal study of treatment retention for participants who
entered the program with their children as compared to
participants who did not enter with children. Mothers
admitted to the program with their children had better
treatment retention and higher rates of successful treat-
ment completion (treatment goals met) than women
admitted without their children [197].
Amity Inc. in Arizona revised its program in 1981 to be
more conducive to the female user. The female to male cli-
ent ratio increased, regular groups were created, and chil-
dren were permitted to stay with their mothers in the
residential program. These changes significantly
improved the treatment outcomes for both men and
women. The length of stay for the women increased over
time; in fact, the length of stay for women with children
in the program was highest overall. The authors suggest
another factor in addition to including children that
contributed to the improved success. This was the creation
of an environment in which female clients feel safe in dis-
closing and addressing treatment issues [198]. In the early
90's, Amity received funds to continue these changes from
NIDA and CSAT [199].
A Perinatal 20 project conducted by Hughes et al. [200]
between April 1990 and October 1992 consisted of 53
women with children who were randomly assigned to
either a standard residential treatment program or a dem-
onstration residential program, in which the children
were allowed to live with their mothers. Operation PAR or
PAR Village includes a treatment component focused on
working with the client as a parent. The psychosocial
interventions employed are aimed at facilitating the par-
ent-child relationship through group interventions,
parenting education, and structured bonding activities.
Operation PAR also includes licensed therapeutic daycare.
Clients in the demonstration component of the program
had significantly longer length of stay, suggesting that
including children in the treatment program has implica-
tions for success. The authors also suggest that the inclu-
sion of children could strengthen mother self-esteem and
mother-child bonds while also improving post-treatment
outcomes.
Outpatient programs
Haller, Knisely, Dawson, and Schnoll [201] compared
subjects randomly assigned to two outpatient treatment
programs. One program was a time-limited program of
five months. The other was a self-paced program for up to
18 months. Results showed that the women in the time-
limited program had significant reductions in alcohol and
drug use.
Another Perinatal 20 project was conducted in South Cen-
tral Los Angeles. This program was designed for the special
treatment and support needs of drug-using women. It also
sought to test the effectiveness of a modified relapse pre-
vention approach. This project compared an intensive six-
month treatment program with a traditional outpatient
program. The day treatment component focused on drug
relapse prevention and competency building and empow-
erment. Clients were required to participate for five and
one half hours per day, seven days per week. The model
was based on the intensity of a residential seven-day week
program; however, clients were allowed to return to their
homes at night. Clients received four hours per week of
education regarding drug abuse, and ten to twelve hours
per week of group or individual counseling to address
problem solving. Refinement of cognitive/behavioral
action plans for relapse prevention was addressed in the
twice-weekly individual counseling sessions. Clients in
the program were also required to complete six hours of
parent training focused on the special care of infants
exposed to drugs. Two days per week the mothers were
required to bring their infants to the site and engage in the
practice of childcare in the nursery. The goal of this com-
ponent was to improve the client's ability to bond and
interact positively with her infant, thus strengthening
infant physical and social development. A parent educa-
tion component was required to help strengthen parent-
ing skills with older children. Here, clients were educated
about development and positive approaches to discipline.
An alcohol and drug free lifestyle was required, although
clients were allowed up to three lapses. These lapses pro-
vided the clients and professionals valuable information
regarding relapse triggers, and aided the relapse preven-
tion plan.
The outpatient component was not as intense as the day
treatment component. Here, the problem of drug depend-
ence was addressed in semi-structured groups, individual
counseling, and other program activities that included
male as well as female clients. The clients in this compo-
nent also received parent education but did not partici-
pate in special training regarding infant development.
This program was a five-day a week, one and one half
hours per day commitment. Clients could participate in
this component for a year or more provided they appeared
to be benefiting from the program.

Results suggest that an intensive day treatment model is
more effective than a standard outpatient treatment
model for a variety of reasons. First, the staff at the day
treatment program was comprised mostly of women and
the staff caseload was smaller that at the outpatient pro-
gram. The study reports that if the day treatment clients
retained custody of their infant, it was a predictor of
length of stay in treatment, however, if the mother had
more children at home, this was a negative predictor of
length of stay. The authors suggest that it may have been
harder for the mothers to secure childcare for more than
one child, if she were in an intensive seven-day a week
program. With regard to amount of social support or psy-
chological distress (reported by the clients), neither pre-
dicted treatment retention [202].
A New York City program, Pregnant Addicts and Addicted
Mothers Program (PAAM) was created in 1975. PAAM is
an outpatient program for pregnant women who are
addicted to opiates or methadone. Potential clients who
have multiple addictions must receive inpatient detoxifi-
cation before attending PAAM. Women enrolled in the
program must attend the program five times per week for
methadone maintenance and attend prenatal visits, indi-
vidual counseling sessions, and parent education classes.
There is a preschool nursery incorporated into PAAM and
children are periodically assessed via the Bayley Scales of
Infant Development. Several of the goals of the PAAM
program concern helping the mother have a normal preg-
nancy and deliver a healthy newborn, as well as helping
the newborn develop normal cognitive and motor abili-
ties. This is a comprehensive program that has demon-
strated positive outcomes such as treatment compliance
and favorable newborn outcomes [180].
California's Options for Recovery was created as an alter-
native to incarceration or relinquishment of custody of
children by substance dependent women. Options for
Recovery offered a specific residential and intensive day
treatment services for dependence on alcohol and or other
drugs, comprehensive case management, foster parent
recruitment and training, and respite care for drug
exposed infants. This program also included a full evalua-
tion component to understand its effectiveness. Seven
sites (Alameda County, Contra Costa County, Harbor
South Bay, South Central LA, Sacramento County, Shasta
County) were developed to help pregnant alcohol- and
other drug-dependent women, postpartum women iden-
tified with a prenatal history of alcohol and other drug
exposure, and parenting women impaired in their ability
to care for their children due to drug addiction. Most of
these projects included goals of increasing services to drug
dependent women, alleviating the deleterious effects of
drug dependence, improving health outcomes for preg-
nant and postpartum women and their children, and
improving family integrity and quality of life.
To provide comprehensive profiles of Options for Recov-
ery, many evaluation approaches were used. For instance,
in addition to client demographics and satisfaction, staff
were also surveyed and interviewed regarding their
impressions of the program. The development of the chil-
dren participating in the program was also included.
Results have been published regarding profiles of the cli-
ents, outcomes for participants, family functioning, child
health outcomes, and participant satisfaction. Specifi-
cally, there were increased numbers of children reunited
with their biological mother after foster care placement
and children in Options homes were more likely to be
reunited with their biological mothers. Children partici-
pating in Options programs displayed normal child devel-
opment on standardized tests. Cost effectiveness was also
assessed for Options for Recovery. Options for Recovery,
as compared to the combined cost of incarceration and
other drug and alcohol treatment, was significantly more
cost effective [203].
Acknowledging all barriers present in treating pregnant
and postpartum substance-using women, the Federal gov-
ernment granted money to demonstration programs to
address these barriers and to combat the epidemic of chil-
dren born substance-exposed. The Parent and Child
Enrichment Program (PACE) program in Harlem began in
1990 as a result of these grants. The program integrated
the services of social workers, drug treatment counselors,
parent educators, childcare workers, and medical person-
nel, including a pediatrician and a nurse midwife. PACE
was set up to provide comprehensive, women-centered,
and family-oriented services. The key focus of the program
was to provide a flexible schedule of treatment to the
women in order to maintain a high retention rate within
the program without encouraging relapses into drug use
[176]. The successes and failures of the program provided
good learning opportunities for the future development
of similar programs.
The program reinforced the need to develop a female
model of drug treatment. Many women enter drug treat-
ment for different reasons, have different reasons for stay-
ing, and have different needs than men. PACE's clients
often came into the program in order to be drug free at the
time of their child's birth in order to keep their child, or to
regain custody of their children. They struggled with feel-
ings of being overwhelmed at their roles as mothers and
caretakers. PACE showed that program flexibility to meet
the needs of the individual client was critical. Compre-
hensive care in one location (one-stop shopping) also

viders, reduced the likelihood of dropping out, enabled
staff to get to know clients well, and allowed women to
feel comfortable disclosing sensitive personal informa-
tion to providers. Many of the program's clients lacked the
necessary skills to be good parents. Offering parenting
classes gave the women confidence in their abilities to
effectively parent. PACE recognized that drug relapse pre-
vention must begin from day one of the treatment pro-
gram so that the women would be aware of the danger of
relapse and be prepared to deal with the urge to go back
to drug use. For many women, their drug use was related
to their status as abused women. The counselors realized
that addressing this issue was as key as addressing the drug
use itself. Finally, PACE showed that drug use does not
happen in a vacuum. Including family members in the
treatment process may help to establish a network of sup-
port for the women, both while they are in treatment and
after [176].
Quantitative results of the program have shown that the
program has had a positive effect on its clients and thus
the project is a useful model for drug treatment programs.
Also the program helped to start a trend in the city of New
York of providing treatment for pregnant and postpartum
women. Table 3 compares services in New York between
1989 and 1993.
Vital components for success
Most professionals agree that a comprehensive program is
best for mothers [204]. Services should be family cen-
tered, community based, multidisciplinary, individually
tailored, and promote competency of the individual
[182]. Finkelstein [205] suggests a relational approach as
a framework for the delivery of services to substance
dependent women. This model develops prevention and
treatment in the context of a multigenerational and
lifespan perspective. A more family centered model of care
may improve treatment and post treatment outcomes.
Table 4[182] includes a list of programs and their
components.
There is general agreement in the literature that programs
need to be comprehensive and include the following com-
ponents: a cognitive/behavioral approach, parent role
models and support, educational and vocational plan-
ning, transportation, mostly female staff, staff sensitive to
issues of population, relapse considered part of treatment,
outreach, case management, family support services such
as child care, medical (including prenatal care), mental
health services, multi-method approaches to measure suc-
cess, follow-up, parent training, child development serv-
ices, family planning, legal services, crisis intervention,
respite care, life skills management, pharmacological serv-
ices, referral services, self-help groups and stress
management.
Family drug courts
Many states are establishing drug courts that deal with
drug offenders. In drug courts the drug offender is
regarded as both a client and a defendant at the same

time. The reason that this is important is because the term
"client" implies that the court has an obligation to offer
certain services [189,206]. With the drug court the
offender is given the opportunity to contract with the
court to seek treatment instead of receiving a jail sentence.
Participants in the drug court system are referred to the
courts from the regular judicial system. If the client agrees
to seek treatment, she will receive inpatient detoxification
services, and in the case of pregnant women, medical
treatment to provide for the care of the fetus during the
withdrawal stage of recovery. After the initial inpatient
detoxification, clients are required to enroll in a one- to
two- year process of outpatient treatment and aftercare
[175,189,206].
Throughout the course of the treatment process partici-
pants report to a caseworker and the drug court judge,
who monitor the progress of the individual. The partici-
pants are often drug tested to ensure that they are indeed
"clean" and are thus abiding by the terms of their
"sentence" [189]. There are different consequences,
dependent on the particular court, for not complying with
the terms. For some courts this may mean immediate
expulsion from the program and jail time; for others the
participant may be given a second chance to prove her
commitment.
At the present time there are 195 drug courts in 43 differ-
ent states and territories. Between 50 and 65 percent of
offenders choose to enroll in the treatment programs
[206]. While the majority of these courts have not been
open long enough to truly evaluate the success of the pro-
grams, initial results are promising. Only time will tell if
the court programs are able to foster long term success,
measured by a lack of relapse into drug use on the part of
the participants in the programs.
Family drug courts are a relatively new innovation in an
effort to protect the best interests of the child. Drug courts
that focused on the adult substance abuser were estab-
lished in the late 1980s. However, it was not until the
1990s that drug courts dealing with family and depend-
ency issues were established. A family drug court is
defined as "a drug court that deals with cases involving
parental rights...which arise out of the substance abuse of
a parent" [207]. Once children are in danger of or have
already been removed from their parents, the family drug
court attempts to help the parent regain or retain custody
or if necessary, permanently place the child. This is done
through intensive use of resources, and commitment on
the part of the parent, the treatment team and the judge.
Family drug courts were developed because traditional
case management methods were not working with sub-
stance abusing parents. For example, a typical case would
involve a referral for abuse and neglect that would be sub-
stance abuse-based with the children removed. Parents
would be given a list of actions to regain custody and they
would be given a court date 6­12 months later. However,
social service workers trying to motivate the parents did
not have the power to compel compliance and the parents
lacked the skills to follow through with that much lati-
tude. The family drug court has the ability to impact the
entire family, including obtaining better compliance on

the part of the parents, by taking jurisdiction of the child;
ongoing monitoring of the cases, and making services
available to the family that are not available in the adult
criminal court. Since the 1997 implementation of ASFA,
the growth of family drug courts has become even more
significant. The timeframe imposed by ASFA has added
momentum to the development of court programs and
procedures to enable families to remain intact, or if
necessary, to terminate parental rights allowing children
access to placement.
There are currently more than 37 family drug courts oper-
ating in 27 states in the U.S. plus 10 combined adult/juve-
nile/family programs, and an additional 50 programs are
being planned. Almost all these programs (88%) focus on
civil abuse and neglect cases and 4% are handling abuse
and neglect cases prosecuted as criminal matters. Most
(90%) family drug courts are voluntary. To date 2,200
have enrolled (84% female), 550 have graduated, 800 are
currently enrolled and there are 3,500 children involved.
Most participants (80%) range in age from 26­45, 48%
are Caucasian, 36% African American and 15% Hispanic,
63% of the females (and 48% of the males) are single, 8%
are living with a significant other, 70% of the females
(52% males) have no high school or GED, 44% of the
females (5% males) are unemployed. And 66% of the par-
ticipants had two or more children, while none of the
children were living with the participant in 65% of the
cases [208].
More than 60% of the children were not living with their
parent at the time of enrollment. Since the first family
drug court started in 1994, 1,000 participants nationwide
have graduated (875 women, 135 men) thereby either
retaining or regaining custody of or visitation with their
children. Another 300 participants representing 20% of
those enrolled have been terminated for noncompliance.
There are currently 900 participants estimated to be
enrolled.
The demographic characteristics of family drug court par-
ticipants indicate that almost all have had at least one
prior contact with CPS and 75% have had two or more
prior contacts. Approximately half have had al least one
prior criminal (generally misdemeanor) conviction prior
to entering the family drug court with less than 10% hav-
ing been incarcerated for a drug related offense. 68% are
single and not living with a significant other, 22% were
living with a significant other (who in most cases was the
parent of at least one of the children) and 6% were mar-
ried. 43% were African American, 35% Caucasian, 19%
Hispanic/Latino and 8% Asian/other. More than two
thirds are unemployed. More than two thirds have been
using drugs for more than 5 years, 15% for more than 10
years with the most common drugs of choice as alcohol,
cocaine and marijuana with one-third reporting addition
to methamphetamine and/or heroin. Addiction to
cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine is rising and more
than half report addiction to prescription medication.
Most have been enrolled in at least one treatment pro-
gram prior to entering family drug court. At least 75%
have a history of being abused and more than one third
suffer from mental health problems.
Outcome research has shown a significant decrease in
drug use by participants once they enter the program with
95% showing negative drug tests [208]. The frequency of
drug testing and the frequency of negative drug tests for
parents in family drug court programs are higher than for
parents in other abuse/neglect (non-drug court) pro-
grams. All participants who completed a family drug court
program were able to improve their legal relationship
with their children, one third retained or regained legal
custody and the remaining two thirds retained or regained
visitation. Participation in family drug courts also resulted
in obtaining or retaining employment in one half of the
cases, two thirds enrolled in vocational training an addi-
tional one third completed their GED and/or enrolled in
college, 90% received mental health treatment, and 40
drug free babies were born to participants while in the
program. Half of the courts have developed alumni
groups or other aftercare support networks.
It should be clear that the focus of family drug court is in
the best interest of the child, while addressing the needs of
the parent participant and the family. These interests may
be in conflict, as the court must be prepared to make per-
manency decisions, especially with ASFA. In addition, the
best interest of the child should not be narrowly defined
­ that which helps the parents is in the best interests of the
child. Although substance abuse is the trigger that brings
the child to the attention of the courts, family drug courts
must go far beyond treating the parent's addiction issue
alone. The treatment team needs to address the issues that
impact the parent's ability to stay sober, including special-
ized services such as mental health, domestic violence,
sexual abuse, parenting, social support and financial
resources (housing and employment) and by trying to
identify strengths in the family.
Model programs
Programs are being established through the cooperative
efforts of the courts, social service workers, and treatment
professionals that can overcome the barriers preventing
pregnant women from seeking treatment, including
access to services, fear of losing their children, cost, and
lack of coordination of care and available services.
The Dependency Court Recovery Project in San Diego
County, California, coordinates treatment services, as well
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5

(page number not for citation purposes)
as other social welfare services the court provides, in order
to keep families intact, or at the very least to reduce the
amount of time that children spend in foster care. The
main feature of the program is the Substance Abuse
Recovery Management System. The purpose of this system
is to make alcohol and drug treatment immediately avail-
able for parents. In this system when a referral is made
from the juvenile court, the family is assigned a social
worker, responsible for overall case management. The
parent is also assigned a recovery specialist, responsible
for ensuring that the dependent parent is assigned to the
appropriate alcohol and drug services and the necessary
follow-up case management.
This program has been successful in meeting statutory
case processing timelines, expediting substance abuse
assessment, achieving "reasonable efforts", reducing the
frequency and length of removal of children from their
homes for placement in foster care, providing immedi-
ately available services and "safe house" residences for the
parent with their child(ren) during recovery, increasing
personal accountability and responsibility of parents for
progress of individual case plans, providing a recovery
management system to engage parents in appropriate
treatment, monitoring progress and increase judicial over-
sight, reducing court workload, determining timely and
appropriate placement for the children, and
accomplishing family preservation, reunification or early
permanent placement.
The success of the program has been attributed to several
factors. These include that all the necessary treatment serv-
ices are made readily available to the women, thus the
issue of transportation and access to care are overcome.
They also include the establishment of treatment sites
where women can go with their children without fear of
losing them. In addition, disciplinary actions are tied to
the program. Since the program has the full backing of the
court, noncompliance with the program bears legal conse-
quences. The first or second time a patient is noncompli-
ant ("dirty test", no-show, or failure to comply with
treatment program activity), the client/offender may get a
warning, but further noncompliance can, and will, war-
rant expulsion from the program and a prison term or
other punitive measure [189].
The Jackson County, Missouri, family drug court targets
mothers who have given birth to drug-exposed infants
and blends both civil and criminal cases [209]. The advan-
tage of the blended court is that it avoids the problem of
the client needing to be in two different courtrooms where
court issues may conflict and not provide a unified
approach for the family. In the civil family/dependency
setting, the court is able to obtain jurisdiction over the
children, allowing the court to order necessary services for
the children. However, because the court does not have
jurisdiction over the parent, the court has the carrot of cus-
tody of the children but not the authority to force the par-
ent to comply with the requirements of the court. The
court gains jurisdiction over the parent through the crim-
inal charge. Here the court has jurisdiction over the
defendant but not the family, thus, family members do
not have to comply.
The program is immediate and intensive and includes
substance abuse assessment and development of a treat-
ment plan including additional specialized services.
Mothers are seen on a weekly basis to ensure treatment
compliance and to insure that the needs of the child are
being met. Both sanctions and incentives are used. Sanc-
tions can be written assignments; more frequent court
appearances and urine screens, chastisement in court and
community services, as well as the ultimate sanction of
child removal. Incentives include reduced court appear-
ance, praise from the bench, certificates, movie passes,
and grocery vouchers. If the mother successfully com-
pletes the family drug court program the criminal case is
treated in a diversionary manner and is dismissed.
The Family Treatment Court in Suffolk County, New York
provides comprehensive and integrated case management
services and intensive case supervision to address the mul-
tifaceted needs of chemically dependent parents and their
children. The program emphasizes immediate assessment
and early intervention and integrates chemical depend-
ency and child welfare services for the entire family
system.
The Vulnerable Infants Program of Rhode Island (VIP-RI)
[210] is based on research suggesting that drug-exposed
infants are vulnerable, not damaged, and that many of
these infants can recover and develop normally given an
appropriate environment. VIP works with CPS and the
court to comply with ASFA and provide a program of
coordinated care for drug-exposed infants and their fami-
lies. VIP conducts a comprehensive and standardized
assessment of the mother (maternal substance depend-
ency, mental health, parenting and attachment, life skills,
family support and resources) and of the infant (medical
and neurobehavioral status) as soon as the baby is identi-
fied as drug exposed in the hospital. The assessments are
used to help CPS make recommendations to the court
regarding placement of the infant with the biological
mother or in foster care and to develop a treatment plan
for use by the court. A special Family Treatment Drug
Court for drug-exposed infants has been established for
VIP clients based on the "treatment with teeth" concept.
The program allows mothers the opportunity to get the
appropriate treatment to be reunited with their infants
and to provide the kinds of ancillary services including

mental health, to make reunification effective and facili-
tate the development of the mother infant attachment
relationship. In this voluntary program, the VIP treatment
plan is court ordered and sanctions are used for noncom-
pliance, the ultimate sanction, of course being loss of cus-
tody of the infant.
Policy issues and recommendations
While it is widely acknowledged that there must be a soci-
etal response to the issue of maternal substance abuse,
there is much controversy on just what this response
should be. Much of this debate is linked to the complica-
tions and dilemmas present in the different policy
responses that have arisen in attempts to address the issue.
Prevention
Most interventions to address the problem of maternal
substance use during pregnancy have focused on prevent-
ing the problem in the first place. These include education
campaigns about the dangers of smoking and drinking
during pregnancy, legislation requiring warning labels on
cigarettes and alcohol, education about the dangers of
illicit drugs such as cocaine and efforts to reduces the use
of illicit drugs through criminalization. Yet, despite these
efforts, drug use by pregnant women continues to be a sig-
nificant public health problem. Thus, policy
recommendations must go beyond attempts to prevent
drug use by pregnant women.
Policy approaches for MATID use include primary, sec-
ondary and tertiary prevention strategies. Because of the
complex substance abuse, psychological, parenting,
social, family and medical issues involved in maternal
drug use during pregnancy, it is easy to fathom that all
aspects of prevention will be required to combat this
problem. Different strategies for intervention can be used
including treatment and research in addition to education
and legislation. These are interrelated and interdepend-
ent, and inform and feedback on each other.
Primary prevention is aimed at preventing the initial
occurrence of the problem ­ in this case, MATID abuse
during pregnancy or avoiding pregnancy while using sub-
stances. This includes informing women of childbearing
age about the dangers of prenatal drug exposure and edu-
cation to abstain from drug use during pregnancy or to
avoid pregnancy if using drugs. Specifically, women of
childrearing age and pregnant women can be educated
about the potential danger to the fetus and child from
exposure to drugs. Providing treatment for drug-using
women of childbearing age could help eliminate drug use
during pregnancy. This could even be an incentive for
women who want to have a baby to initiate treatment.
Intervention to practice contraception is a way to prevent
pregnancy in drug-using women and would also help
reduce the spread of STDs and HIV. Use of fetal ultra-
sound to show the mother her fetus can increase attach-
ment and potentially result in cessation of dug use during
pregnancy.
Secondary prevention aimed at minimizing a problem
when a risk factor exists would identify pregnant drug-
using women and attempt to minimize their drug use
through educational, treatment, research, and regulatory
interventions [30]. Relatively little attention has been paid
to the early detection of substance use during pregnancy
[211,212]. We mentioned earlier that many pregnant
drug-using women receive little or no prenatal care and it
is known that fear of detection because of potential puni-
tive actions against the women and the potential for
removal of the child drive pregnant drug using women
away from the health care system. As a result many prena-
tal substance exposure cases are not identified until birth.
For prevention to be effective, the health care system
needs to be perceived as friendly and supportive by drug-
using pregnant women, not as punitive. They can be
attracted to take advantage of prenatal care if they think it
will help them and their child. Health care professionals
can be better trained to detect substance abuse during
pregnancy and to respond to comply with reporting
requirements and in arranging services for the patient.
A harm reduction model might argue for low-level use of
some substances, or even that use of some substances is
tolerable for the benefit of cessation of other substances.
For example, should pregnant women on methadone
maintenance or those who use cocaine in residential treat-
ment, or those who are in prison be allowed to smoke?
Should they be allowed less than 10 cigarettes a day if that
is the threshold for negative effects on the baby? Should
they be given psychotropic medication to treat the anxi-
ety/depression that accompanies abstinence even if these
drugs are contraindicated for pregnant women?
Tertiary prevention aims to minimize the adverse conse-
quences of a problem, in this case the short term or long
term harm to the child caused by drug exposure. This
includes mental health, medical and social interventions,
treatment for the mother and family members as well as
treatment for the infant, and parenting and parent/child
relationship therapy.
Prevention efforts should include education and treat-
ment and target all drugs (i.e., licit and illicit) that have
abuse potential during pregnancy. In addition to the
drugs mentioned in this review (alcohol, tobacco and ille-
gal drugs), abuse of prescription drugs should also be
included. For example, there is an emerging literature on
abuse of benzodiazapenes, OxyContin, during pregnancy.
Prevention efforts should be organized to enhance protec-
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5

(page number not for citation purposes)
tive factors and to minimize risk factors. These efforts
need to be developmentally and culturally appropriate,
capitalize on the mother's motivation to change and
desire to keep or be reunited with her baby. They also
should deal with the complexity of these cases including
mental health co-morbidities and should have a family
and community focus.
Scientific uncertainty
Policies have been established in the context of uneven
scientific knowledge about MATID use and developmen-
tal outcome. The literature is uneven with respect to type
of drug (more is known about alcohol than other drugs)
and in terms of drug effects, there is uncertainty as to
whether or not illegal drugs have more deleterious effects
than legal drugs. Mostly we do not know the long-term
developmental effects of prenatal drug exposure per se.
That is, drug effects have not been "isolated" from other
effects (environmental as well as genetic), drug effects
have not been studied in a developmental model that
would enable us to determine the risk associated with
drugs in the context of other risk factors, and polydrug
effects have not been studied. It is remarkable that at a
time when we acknowledge that most women who use
drugs during pregnancy are polydrug users, studies have
not examined the effects of polydrug exposure on devel-
opmental outcome. It is probably safe to say at this point
that scientific facts do not support the "quick fix" linear
approach that focuses on the single risk factor of prenatal
drug exposure as the explanation for the outcomes of
these children.
Public awareness
A related issue is that the public should be aware of the
scientific advances in the last 20 years. These advances
include understanding of addiction as a chronic, relapsing
medial/mental health problem, consequences of prenatal
drug exposure for child development, and effectiveness of
treatment. It does not appear as if this knowledge has
reached (or been accepted by) the general public or has
been applied in clinical programs or policy settings. This
situation is exacerbated by the stigma surrounding drug
use during pregnancy. Pregnant women are not extended
the compassion normally displayed by the public towards
individually suffering from chronic diseases. The view that
substance abuse should not be treated as another mental
health and medical illness is at odds with established
science.
Fetal rights
There have been several routes that the courts have taken
in attempting to prosecute women for substance abuse
during pregnancy. The most basic routes of societal
response include the following: (1) use of the penal code
to regulate all behavior of pregnant women that places the
fetus at risk of harm; (2) use of the penal code to regulate
all illegal behavior (particularly the use of controlled sub-
stances) that place the fetus at risk of harm; (3) use of fam-
ily law and the power of the state to ensure that the best
interests of the child are served, whether the behavior of
the parent is legal or illegal; and (4) the use of no addi-
tional criminal or family law regulations specifically tar-
geted at fetal abuse, relying instead on current language
and policies to guide decision making [151,162].
The filing of any charges against a substance-abusing
mother hinges on the notion of fetal rights, namely that
fetuses are human beings entitled to certain rights and
privileges [213]. Much of the debate around the issue of
perinatal substance exposure has focused on this very
idea. There are many questions as to whether fetuses are
really entitled to protection under the law, and if they are,
what are the widespread social implications. Certainly the
question of what rights the fetus is entitled to is intrinsi-
cally tied to the argument of when life begins and when is
it appropriate for society to regulate the current behavior
of the mother in order to prevent potential future harm to
the child [214].
Since the beginning of the fetal rights movement, propo-
nents have maintained that the fetus is a human being
possessing an existence separated from that of its mother
and because of its existence, entitled to legal acknowledge-
ment. Among these fundamental rights is the right to be
born with a sound mind and body [156]. The court has
favored this point in several cases, ruling in favor of the
fetus in such cases as In re Baby X [215], Grodin v. Grodin,
[216] and In re Ruiz [217].
More recent effects of the fetal rights movement are evi-
dent in legislation that states have tried to adapt in
response to the wave of media attention directed towards
"crack" babies. Most of the changes and adaptations in
legislation have been in existing criminal child neglect
and abuse legislation, essentially widening the definitions
of child to include the unborn. It is interesting to note
however, that while states have successfully adapted exist-
ing laws to include fetuses and have even successfully
prosecuted between 200 and 300 women, no state has cre-
ated legislation that specifically penalizes pregnant drug
users with additional punishment for the effect that their
drug use and abuse has on their unborn child. One factor
that this is attributed to is the difficulty in definitively
establishing a correlation between the mother's drug use
and harm to the child.
There is certainly a flip side to the fetal rights movement.
In fact, strong opposition has been raised to the idea that
the fetus is a human with its own existence separate from
that of its mother. Opponents fear the "slippery slope"
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5
Page 32 of 44
(page number not for citation purposes)
effect that may occur if the rights of the fetus are acknowl-
edged [154,158,213]. The slippery slope argument
purports that acknowledging the rights of the fetus in any
circumstance potentially has the adverse effect of making
the rights of the fetus take precedence over the rights of
the mother in all circumstances. It poses the question: if
we allow the regulation of one sphere of pregnancy, where
do we stop [162]? This would have serious implications
for other issues surrounding the rights of the fetus versus
the rights of the mother, including abortion.
Fetal/maternal conflicts
It is important to acknowledge at the outset that policies
for the pregnant woman/mother may be in conflict with
policies for the fetus/infant. For example, high doses of
methadone used for heroin-addicted pregnant women
can produce withdrawal in the infant. Lower doses that
would not produce withdrawal in the infant increase the
risk that the methadone will be less effective and the preg-
nant woman return to street drugs. As another example,
both managed care and welfare reform have resulted in
sanctions that reduce services to drug using mothers, such
as when drug users are not eligible for benefits [135]. The
irony is that such policies are based on concern for the
child ant not only create a rift between advocates for
women and advocates for children, but also mean that
mother and child face poverty without public assistance
or the child enters the foster care system.
Perinatal drug screening
One of the major issues that arise in trying to isolate a
response to maternal drug use is related to screening for
drug use in women and for exposure in newborns. It is dif-
ficult to determine who should be tested. Often times this
question is answered in a way that exhibits different biases
present in society. Targeted testing, which leaves testing
up to the discretion of the hospital and physicians, intro-
duces the possibility of significant bias in decision-mak-
ing. Tremendous inconsistency is inevitable with targeted
testing because it is highly plausible that identification
can more be a function of area of residence, hospital pol-
icy, and physician prerogative [218]. One argument for
universal testing of newborns is that it is the only way to
employ testing devoid of social biases. A second argument
is that universal testing also ensures that exposed infants
who are detected will be able to receive all available serv-
ices and treatment [219].
However, universal testing of infants places hospitals in a
precarious position. Traditionally hospitals provide serv-
ices to patients in a confidential and nonjudgmental way.
But if a newborn exhibits a positive toxicology screen and
the state has a mandatory reporting law, the hospital has
a responsibility to report that fact to the necessary author-
ities in order to ensure the protection of the welfare of the
child. In cases such as this there is a conflict between the
hospital's responsibility to protect the confidentiality of
the mother and responsibility to protect the welfare of the
infant [178,220].
Another problem is that hospitals typically only screen for
illegal drugs. There is no newborn screen for alcohol, yet
the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure are at least as
severe as the effects of illegal drugs. Some have argued that
the effects of nicotine are comparable if not worse than
the effects of cocaine. Yet even though there are nicotine
assays for urine and meconium they are not used to iden-
tify exposed infants. And what would we do with this
information? Would we really report up to 25% of new
mothers to an already overburdened child welfare and
criminal justice system because nicotine and cocaine have
similar effects on the baby?
Another option for screening is to not test at all and sim-
ply rely on the self-report of the mother. The benefit of
this option is that it greatly reduces the possibility of vio-
lating the civil liberties of the mother, treatment avoid-
ance by the mother, and biased use of child welfare/
criminal involvement. It would also allow healthcare
workers to simply treat the mothers without being in an
investigative role. By allowing healthcare workers to sim-
ply treat them, the mothers may feel more comfortable in
admitting their drug use and more willing to accept treat-
ment. However there is also the risk that mothers will not
disclose their drug use. Lack of disclosure by the mother
would render physicians unable to identify high-risk
infants and thus unable to prevent negative
outcomes[219].
Finally, it might be possible to develop very specific crite-
ria for drug testing based on specific medical indicators
and that avoids use of such open-ended criteria as "clini-
cal suspicion" that invite discriminatory testing. This solu-
tion would work with two caveats. First, all drugs would
be included (legal and illegal and prescription medication
that can also be abused such as benzodiazipines or perco-
dan, OxyContin) Second, the mother would not be auto-
matically reported to CPS. Rather, the point of drug
testing would be to provide hospital staff with the oppor-
tunity for intervention and the possibility of an additional
standardized assessment if there is concern for the welfare
of the child. Only if such an assessment suggested indi-
cated inadequate parenting would the mother be reported
to CPS.
Who gets prosecuted
Another problem associated with criminalization is that
of prejudicial reporting practices. Many fear that racial dis-
crepancies in prosecutions are related to racial prejudices
among people who report maternal substance abuse and
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5

the criminal justice system as a whole. The overwhelming
majority of the 200 to 300 women prosecuted for
perinatal substance abuse have been illegal drug users;
most notably and most often crack cocaine users [221].
Studies have shown that more minority women are crack
cocaine users than other demographic groups. Thus
women of color are most likely to be prosecuted for peri-
natal substance abuse. This has led to the concern that
criminalizing of perinatal substance abuse is in fact a
process that is discriminatory against poor women of
color [220].
Beyond the fact that more crack users are prosecuted than
pregnant drug users, there is a class component regarding
who is prosecuted for drug use. The government prose-
cutes more impoverished women than those in the
middle class [218]. This is because middle class women
are more apt to use the services of private physicians. Pri-
vate physicians who treat middle class and wealthy
women are less likely to question their patients' behavior
based on an unsubstantiated belief that wealthier women
are less likely to use or abuse substances. By contrast, phy-
sicians are more likely to question poor minority women
about their substance abuse and ultimately report their
drug use [152].
A 1990 Florida study produced statistics supporting the
notion that there is a race and class bias in reporting. The
study revealed that while there was very little difference in
abuse rates between black and white women, rates of
reporting are drastically different. According to the study,
physicians are ten times more likely to report a black
woman than a white woman. The most frequently
reported subjects were low-income women who relied on
public health care [222]. In a similar study, poor minority
women were the subjects of 81% of government sought
court-ordered interventions [33].
Another illustration of this point is found in a 1990 Amer-
ican Civil Liberties Union report. This report stated that
50% of the nation's drug arrests were in South Carolina.
Of those arrested all were low income and most were
black. Specifically, between 1989 and 1993, forty-one
pregnant women were arrested for drug abuse in South
Carolina. Forty of those women were black. Finally in a
separate review of thirty-five states' police records, 70% to
80% of all women arrested on drug charges were minori-
ties [71].
Little is known about the intersection of cultural variation
and parenting in drug-using mothers in ways that help us
understand culturally determined family behavior that is
not maltreatment but is likely to be interpreted as such.
We need to understand the role that institutional and
other forms of racism play in the identification and treat-
ment of drug-using mothers.
Constitutional issues
There are many constitutional issues surrounding the
prosecution of pregnant drug users. At the heart of contro-
versy are several Fourteenth Amendment entitlements,
including due process, liberty, and equal protection. The
Fourteenth Amendment states, "...nor shall any State
deprive any person of... liberty...without due process of
law; nor deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws."
This statement of due process under the law creates a situ-
ation in which the state must have a clearly defined objec-
tive when intervening in the lives of citizens. This
objective must be tied to public health, safety, or welfare.
This is certainly not where the due process clause stops. In
fact it goes on to assert that whatever the planned inter-
vention the state chooses to implement must be related to
achieving the aforementioned objective. There also must
be a relative degree of certainty that the intervention will
be effective in accomplishing the intended goal. If the fun-
damental rights of an individual will be infringed upon
due to the intervention, then the State must demonstrate
that the intervention is reasonable, narrowly constructed,
and that there is no less intrusive way of accomplishing
the goal [150,220].
Based upon the criteria laid out by the due process clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment, there have been several
issues raised in relation to state intervention in the lives of
drug-using mothers. Firstly, there is the issue of criminal
prosecution itself. Is criminal prosecution really an effec-
tive intervention in deterring pregnant women from using
drugs? There is much controversy over whether criminali-
zation of the act really is an effective deterrent.
There is also the issue of physician disclosure of positive
toxicology results to the authorities. The public disclosure
of these results coupled with the use of the women's med-
ical records are often used against the women in prosecu-
torial settings. This could be a violation of the women's
right to privacy and freedom of association. Along the
same lines it is often argued that by requiring physicians
to report positive toxicology results the medical provider
is forced into a situation where they are law enforcers and
thus must obtain informed consent from their patients
before performing any tests that may result in criminal
prosecution [144,149,162]. This is likened to law enforce-
ment officials having to obtain a warrant before search
and seizure. Often, drug screens are performed on the
mothers without their knowledge or consent. This raises
strong questions about violation of the mother's rights as
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5

related to their Fourth Amendment protection against ille-
gal search and seizure.
Policing pregnancy: Ferguson v. Charleston
With the case of Ferguson v. Charleston, the Supreme
Court has entered into the legal arena surrounding mater-
nal substance abuse. The case of Ferguson v. Charleston
deals with the practices of a Charleston, S.C. public hospi-
tal regarding the testing and reporting of women for sub-
stance abuse when they come to deliver their babies. In
the fall of 1988, staff members at the Charleston public
hospital operated by the Medical University of South
Carolina became concerned with the increasing numbers
of patients coming in for prenatal care who were also
using cocaine. To combat these numbers, in April of 1989
the hospital adopted a policy of referring cocaine-using
maternity patients to both counseling and treatment pro-
grams. Referrals would be made based upon drug screens
performed on urine samples from maternity patients who
were suspected of using cocaine [221,223,224].
Despite the efforts of MUSC staff, the number of cocaine-
using maternity patients remained constant. The hospital
then decided to offer its support and cooperation to the
city in prosecuting mothers whose children tested positive
for drugs at the time of birth. The women could undergo
drug treatment to avoid prosecution. Babies would be
tested only if their mothers were suspected of drug use.
Suspicion was based on the following criteria: no prenatal
care, late prenatal care after 24 weeks gestation, incom-
plete prenatal care, abruptio placentae, intrauterine fetal
death, preterm labor "of no obvious cause," intrauterine
growth retardation "of no obvious cause," previously
known drug or alcohol abuse" or unexplained congenital
anomalies.
The plaintiffs were ten women, including nine women of
color, who were arrested directly based on the hospital's
policy. Four of the women were immediately arrested,
while six were offered the option of drug treatment, but
either failed to comply or failed a second drug screen. The
women challenged the practice on the theory that war-
rantless and nonconsensual drug tests conducted for crim-
inal investigatory purposes were unconstitutional
searches [223]. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the
women, saying that the women's Fourth Amendment
Rights had indeed been violated. Because MUSC is a state
hospital, its staff members are government actors subject
to the Fourth Amendment's strictures. They found that a
state's performance of a diagnostic test to obtain evidence
of a patient's criminal conduct for law enforcement pur-
poses is an unreasonable search if the patient has not con-
sented to the procedure. The interest in using the threat of
criminal sanctions to deter pregnant women from using
cocaine cannot justify a departure from the general rule
that an official nonconsensual search is unconstitutional
if not authorized by a valid warrant [183,225]. This ruling
will change the relationship between hospitals and law
enforcement with respect to reporting of evidence of ille-
gal drug use during pregnancy.
Backlash against criminalization
There are other reasons beyond the constitutionality of
prosecuting perinatal substance abusers that have come
into play in the backlash against criminalization. Many
professional health care and child welfare organizations
have banded together against criminalization on the basis
that it is antithetical to the best interests of both the
mother and the child. They also argue that it puts health-
care providers in the inappropriate and uncomfortable
position of having to police their patients. Reasons for the
rejection of criminalization include that criminalization
has no proven effect on improving infant health or deter-
ring substance abuse by pregnant women. In fact, crimi-
nalization may in fact deter the pregnant woman from
seeking out necessary prenatal care for fear of losing their
children or being arrested.
Criminalization of perinatal substance abuse creates
untenable legal and ethical obligations for health care
providers and other statutory mandatory reporters. It
stretches the limits of what it means to be a caregiver.
Finally, criminalization has been shown to be discrimina-
tory based on race and socioeconomic status [220].
Impact of welfare reform
The passage of the Personal Responsibility Work Oppor-
tunity and Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), or welfare
reform act in 1996, affects availability of resources, living
conditions and medical services to drug using mothers.
The act sought to reduce the number of children growing
up in poor single parent families by promoting marriage
and requiring mothers to move from welfare to work. The
legislation is probably best known for having repealed the
Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) pro-
gram and for providing states with TANF (Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families) block grants to design
work focused, time limited welfare programs. However,
the 1996 law was more extensive as it made major
changes affecting a wide range of programs that provide
services to low income children, including child support
enforcement, child care, Medicaid, food stamps, child
welfare and disability benefits. The law restricted services
to immigrants and reduced federal protections for indi-
viduals while expanding state discretion and flexibility in
implementing social policy. The law also generated new
rounds of discussion about out-of-wedlock births, fathers,
and marriage and family formation.
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5

(page number not for citation purposes)
Under AFDC, states were mandated to provide assistance
to all eligible poor families, but had broad discretion in
setting benefit levels. The federal government paid half or
more of all program costs based on caseload levels. States
were required to provide work-related services and
requirements for AFDC families but these programs were
often not well funded and reached a limited number of
eligible families. Under TANF, each state receives a block
grant and has broad discretion in using the funds for pro-
grams that provide case assistance for needy families, as
well as for other benefits and services that accomplish the
four purposes of the law:
· Provide assistance to needy families so that children can
be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of
relatives;
· End needy parents' dependence on government benefits
by promoting job preparation, work, and marriage;
· Prevent and reduce the incidence of out of wedlock preg-
nancies; and
· Encourage the formation and maintenance of two-par-
ent families.
TANF enabled states to tie assistance to specified maternal
behaviors and includes drug-related prohibitions
including ineligibility for drug felons. Thirty-five states
have elected to deny options to drug felons and at least 10
states require drug testing for TANF applicants [226].
Other provisions of these new rules will also affect drug-
using mothers. Estimates are that 15­20% of the TANF
population has drug problems that limit their ability to
work [227,228]. Drug treatment improves employability
[229], but drug treatment and related services are inade-
quate. Moreover, if mothers are ineligible for benefits due
to sanctions, the funds available for treatment programs
will be reduced because many treatment programs
depend on block grants, Medicaid reimbursement, and
public assistance benefits.
TANF could also be detrimental because of the historical
connection between AFDC and the child welfare system.
Families in the two systems face substance abuse and
related mental health problems, domestic violence, and
poverty, and both programs support many children who
are being cared for by grandparents and other relatives
[230,231]. The more stringent work load, sanction, and
time limit requirements under TANF, as well as the dis-
posable income some families may experience as they
move from welfare to work could lead to increased drug
use and involvement of child welfare. Two studies looking
at AFDC caseloads found that sanctions and work com-
bined in ways associated with more CPSA involvement
and longer stays in foster care [232,233]. In another study
[234], neglect and out of home care increased when cash
assistance benefit levels decreased. In addition, rates of
neglect increased as the number of single working moth-
ers increased. Families that participated in Delaware's
AFDC waiver program (similar to TANF requirements)
had higher rates of child neglect than those in the control
group [235]. Child welfare agencies in 12 states reported
that lack of child care supervision had increased under
TANF as had the number of families surrendering their
children to child welfare agencies or delaying reunifica-
tion of children already in care [236].
TANF can affect the amount of money spent on child wel-
fare services such as substance abuse treatment, mental
health, parenting education, and supports available for
children in kinship care (grandparents or relatives) [237].
Finally, there is the related concern that TANF legislation
could impact poor children with disabilities receiving
supplemental social security income. The criteria used by
the Social Security Administration for determining
"marked and severe functional limitations" in children
has been criticized for being too stringent [238,239] and
would rule out many drug-exposed children from obtain-
ing much needed services.
Policy recommendations
It would be easy to look at the shortcomings of the current
policies surrounding issues of maternal substance abuse
and lose hope at the prospects for improvement for the
future. However, strides in the right direction are being
made. The pendulum has swung back in the direction of
providing treatment to pregnant drug users in an attempt
to both address their addiction and preserve their fami-
lies. There is certainly progress to be made in achieving
policies and practices that effectively address all the issues
that these women and their children face. We have
divided policy recommendations into the following cate-
gories: (i) Education, (ii) Legal, (iii) Assessment, (iv)
Financial, (v) Training, (vi) Treatment and (vii) Research.
Education
Educate the public about the social and political issues surrounding
the stigma of drug abuse in general and specifically with respect to
dug use by pregnant women
This includes acceptance about drug use as a mental
health/medical problem, that drug use does not automat-
ically rule out adequate parenting, how development
unfolds in drug exposed children, the effectiveness of
treatment including court involvement, barriers to treat-
ment, and that barriers to treatment and punishment of
the mother may not be in the best interests of the child. In
addition to the "general' public, this education should
also target state and federal legislators, state agencies, CPS,
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5

(page number not for citation purposes)
child welfare workers, court, drug and alcohol treatment
programs.
Educate the public about the dangers of prenatal drug exposure
Although pregnant women and women of childbearing
age should be high priority, it is also important to educate
preadolescent girls and boys, and men as well as women.
Partners can have a substantial influence on each other's
drug use. Having partners and friends with anti-drug use
attitudes can help prevent drug use during pregnancy. This
education should make it clear that 1) although not all
drug exposed children will be affected, some will and they
will be affected from birth; others might look normal at
birth and not show problems until years later, 2) all drugs
of abuse (legal as well as illegal and prescription medica-
tion such as benzodiazapenes and OxyContin, percodan)
can affect the child, 3) prenatal care and connection to the
healthcare system is important for the health of the baby
and can lead to treatment if drugs are involved, 5) good
parenting can help these babies but it is hard to be a good
parent when you are using drugs, 6) mental health
problems are often co-morbid with drug dependency and
will also affect child outcome.
Educate health care providers
This includes education to 1) detect drug use during preg-
nancy, 2) understand that non-supportive, punitive
attitudes drive pregnant women away from the health care
system depriving them of prenatal care and opportunity
for help, 3) learn about the unique issues and needs of
these women, and 4) learn what resources are available in
the community to make appropriate referrals and connect
these women to services.
Educate that policies must be developed that are fair to both mother
and child
Treatment providers and policy makers should not have
to "choose" between the welfare of the mother and the
welfare of the child.
Disseminate educational materials
Education includes dissemination. Educational materials
should be prepared so that they are understandable,
meaningful and user friendly for the targeted audience.
This will require the preparation of different materials for
different audiences including different media (e.g.,
printed, audio, video, in-person testimony, Internet, con-
ferences, "town meetings,"). Dissemination should be
geared at reaching the public using the media (newspa-
pers, etc), and lawmakers.
Legal
Develop federal laws and guidelines for dealing with the detection of
drug use during pregnancy, placement of drug-exposed infants and
the treatment of drug using mothers and their infants
The purpose of these laws would be to provide a set of
uniform policies for the nation based on current "state of
the art" knowledge described above under "Education."
These Federal policies would include:
Drug testing should be targeted and only be based on spe-
cific medical criteria and not include ambiguous criteria
(such as "clinical suspicion") that invite discriminatory
testing of minority and underprivileged patients.
An infant should be considered drug-exposed and in need
of some level of intervention if the mother states she has
used illegal drugs during pregnancy or if drug exposure is
shown through toxicology tests of the infant.
When an infant is identified as drug-exposed, the infant
and his/her family should be assessed by hospital health
providers (with assistance when necessary from develop-
mental, drug treatment, and other specialists) using a
standardized assessment battery to determine what inter-
vention, if any, is needed. An identified drug-exposed
infant should be reported to child protective services only
if factors in addition to prenatal drug exposure show that
the infant is at risk for abuse or neglect. Drug use alone is
not sufficient to report to CPS. It is a risk factor. Reporting
to CPS is only required when the standardized assessment
battery indicates evidence of inadequate parenting that
places the child at risk for abuse/neglect in addition to
drug use.
A drug-exposed infant should be removed from the cus-
tody if his/her parent (s) only if the parent (s) are unable
to protect and care for the infant and either support serv-
ices are not sufficient to manage this risk, or the parent (s)
have refused such services. If the parent (s) are not capable
of resuming custody of the infant within 12­18 months,
despite receiving services to make reunification possible, a
permanent alternative placement should be promptly
provided for the infant.
Family drug courts for drug-exposed infants should be
established with the goals of keeping infants with their
biological mothers if there is no documented risk of
abuse/neglect, providing court ordered treatment and
plans for reunification or alternative permanency plan-
ning to comply with ASFA.
The availability of resources, living conditions, benefits
and medical services to drug using mothers and their
infants including benefits (e.g. TANF) should not be
Harm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5
Page 37 of 44
(page number not for citation purposes)
denied to drug-using women who comply with their
court-ordered treatment program.
A woman who uses illegal drugs during pregnancy should
not be subject to special criminal prosecution on the basis
of allegations that her illegal drug use harms the fetus. Nor
should states adopt special civil commitment provisions
for pregnant women who use drugs.
Barriers to child protective services' capacity to meet the
requirements of current child welfare laws should be iden-
tified and removed. These barriers include high caseloads,
lack of drug treatment and support services for the family,
backlogs in the court, and inadequate numbers of foster
or adoptive homes.
Assessment
Develop universal guidelines for comprehensive risk assessment
A standardized assessment battery that includes maternal
substance dependency, mental health, parenting, family
resources and support, life skills, home environment, and
infant neuro-behavior and medical status should be
administered. The battery includes standardized scoring
with specific criteria for additional evidence of abuse/
neglect that requires reporting to CPS. The battery also
includes guidelines for placement recommendations and
developing treatment plans based on the assessment. If
the mother is identified prenatally, much of the battery
can be administered before delivery. If the mother is iden-
tified at birth, the battery should be administered before
the infant is discharged with follow-up assessments at
selected intervals determined by the court. The battery
should be administered by trained, certified staff that can
interface with hospital, CPS, and court staff and with treat-
ment providers.
Financial
Spend early, spend often, spend more: Specifically, increase funding
for prevention and intervention programs during the prenatal and
infancy periods
Funding should be available for programs that are fre-
quent and comprehensive dealing with mental health and
family issues as well as drug dependency. The portion of
the National Drug Control Budget for treatment, preven-
tion and research should be doubled. The proportion of
the NIH research budget for substance abuse research
including policy research and research on developmental
consequences of prenatal MATID exposure, treatment,
prevention and health services should be increased. Spe-
cific funds should be allocated for "out of the box"
research in areas that cross traditional disciplinary lines
and therefore, NIH institutes. For example, joint NIMH
and NIDA funds should address mental health and sub-
stance abuse issues. NIAAA and NIDA should collaborate
on research involving alcohol and illegal drug use. Policy
research cutting across all institutes should also be
funded.
Develop cost effective services
Treating substance abuse as an isolated problem is
doomed to fail. Wraparound mental health and family
support services need to be provided for these families.
Develop reimbursements strategies so that mental health,
parenting and family support services can be bundled in
with substance abuse treatment. These should be viewed
as packages rather than as compartmentalized separate
services. Establish one carve-out for the maternal sub-
stance abuse, mental health and family assessment and
treatment services, a second carve-out for all of the child
assessment and treatment services and a third carve-out
for case management. The same service provider or pro-
vider group should provide these services at a single loca-
tion (one-stop shopping). Medicaid coverage should be
expanded to include these services.
Guarantee that drug using mothers in treatment keep their
insurance
This includes medical benefits and TANF.
Understand that economic issues need to be understood and
factored into policy decisions but they should be viewed only as one
of many factors, never the sole factor
View economic issues in the context of moral values and
value systems to relieve suffering and provide needed care.
Understand that there is no cheap fix but that prevention
and treatment are cost effective when compared with the
toll that drugs take on society.
Training
Develop training programs and train hospital personnel in the
administration, scoring and interpretation of the assessment battery
Train CPS staff, the court, treatment and service providers
and third party reimburses in how to understand the
assessment battery, and provide cross-training so that all
parties involved appreciate each other's areas of expertise.
Train foster/adoptive parents and treatment providers in
best practices for drug-exposed infants. Develop training
programs and train professionals to provide multiple
(bundled) services. Train one set of professionals in
maternal issues (assessment and treatment of substance
abuse, mental health disorders, and family systems,
parenting, child development and women's issues) and
second group in infant and child assessment and treat-
ment and a third in case management. Provide multidis-
ciplinary substance abuse clinical training of health
professionals as part of academic programs, postgraduate
programs, and specialty licensing programs.

Treatment
Improve access to treatment
Drug treatment programs should be available for all drug-
abusing pregnant women and parents of infants as well as
women of childbearing age, and these programs should
be comprehensive and responsive to other related needs
of these families, including mental health, health, devel-
opmental, parenting education and other support serv-
ices. Treatment programs should include thorough
assessment of the infants that includes an evaluation of
developmental areas such as motor, cognition, language,
self help skills, coping skills, and emotional well being,
and should be conducted at regular intervals including
after placement in foster care for infants not with their
biological mothers. Treatment programs should be fam-
ily-based and include partners as well as other siblings.
Develop coordinated multidisciplinary treatment programs with
interconnected services based on the needs mothers and children
Include expectations for relapse as part of treatment mod-
els and mechanisms to help reduce relapse such as pro-
grams for transition back to the community, halfway
houses and step-down facilities. Extended follow-up
should be seen as an integral part of treatment. Recognize
that maltreatment includes both abuse and neglect, that
more is known about abuse than neglect, abuse is more
visible, easier to diagnose and less subtle than neglect.
Develop different strategies and interventions for abuse
and neglect based on the different family dynamics
involved. Establish connections to state programs such as
early intervention programs, early head start, head start
and follow through to preschool services.
Develop preventive intervention efforts
These efforts should start as early as possible (during preg-
nancy, if and when possible). All drug-exposed infants
should automatically qualify for early intervention serv-
ices. Prevention efforts should enhance protective factors
and minimize risk factors, be developmentally appropri-
ate and culturally sensitive, but at the same time should
not stereotype families. They should capitalize on the
mother's motivation to change and desire to keep or be
reunited with her baby while also working within her
readiness to change; that deal with the complexity of these
cases including mental health co-morbidities; and should
have a family and community focus.
Research
Basic research should study (a) the prevalence of MATID use among
pregnant women (not solely based on self-report), (b) the relationship
between such use and birth and developmental outcomes, and (c)
the effectiveness of drug treatment and intervention programs
Special focus should be given to evaluating drug treatment
programs for pregnant women and parents with infants
for their effectiveness in enabling participants to function
as adequate caretakers of their children. Research should
address the demographics of perinatal drug users (geogra-
phy, social and minority status), level of use (hard core
addicts versus recreational users), and drug and drug com-
binations (polydrug use). The consequences of prenatal
MAITD exposure should be studied with reference to
developmental models, long term effects, specific as well
as polydrug effects, comparison of legal and illegal drugs,
effect size and clinical significance, the role of confound-
ing variables and drugs as a risk factor. Research also
needs to determine the role of protective and resiliency
factors and to understand factors that buffer the child
against the adverse consequences of prenatal drug
exposure.
Research needs to be conducted in which treatment pro-
grams are monitored by independent evaluators, which
use clinical trials methodology and determine cost effec-
tiveness. This includes research on the effectiveness of
drug courts. Finally research needs to determine which
interventions are most effective for specific groups of the
maternal drug using population.
Policy research should have a specific focus on issues related to
mothers (MATID) and their infants.
· Research needs to address how policies for mothers and
infants are affected by:
· Findings that suggest subtle and comparable effects due
to MATID including similar effects for legal and illegal
drugs;
· Criminal/punitive versus mental health/disease views of
addiction;
· Conflicts between programs that address fetal issues and
programs that address maternal issues;
Policy research also needs to address the:
· Effects of ASFA including long-term effects of on relapse
after reunification
· Effects of treatment drug courts on permanency place-
ment, compliance with ASFA, foster care, substance partic-
ipation in substance abuse treatment, relapse, and child
outcome;
· Effects of welfare reform on participation in treatment

Conclusions
The issue of MATID use during pregnancy sits squarely at
the intersection of behavioral teratology, jurisprudence,
mental health, medicine, child protection, chemical
dependency, civil rights, and women's issues perhaps in a
way that no other controversy has. We learned a hard
lesson from the cocaine controversy and saw the pendu-
lum swing from an overestimation of risk associated with
prenatal cocaine exposure to a more balanced view. That
view includes the notion that, from a public health per-
spective, even subtle effects have significant societal
impact and cost. The task at hand is to make sure that we
view all drugs of abuse through a common lens, regardless
of legal status, social or political considerations, so that
their impact on child outcome can be adequately assessed
leading to appropriate policy making.
There is a substantial disconnect between our knowledge,
policy and practice regarding maternal drug use during
pregnancy. For example, the drug control budget has
more than doubled in the past decade. Yet the proportion
of the budget devoted to treatment and prevention is
unchanged, despite the gains made in science, and in our
understanding of the nature of addiction in research
showing that treatment and prevention are effective.
Arguably, the major barrier facing changes in policies for
drug-using mothers is societal attitude. We have Supreme
Court rulings that define drug use as a mental problem,
we have modern evidence that treatment is effective and
that there is no reason to consider drug use as different
than any other mental/medical problem; there are treat-
ment programs shown to be effective with drug-using
mothers; and there are treatments with the programs
involving the courts. We have identified all other barriers,
yet why has policy not changed? Is it because we are still
angry and want to punish these mothers? That we will not
forgive them for using drugs when they are pregnant? The
great tragedy is that we are only harming the children. We
harm them by denying service, by increasing the number
of children in out of home placement, by undermining
the ability of the children to form attachment relation-
ships, and by labeling these children as damaged. We
know the danger of self-fulfilling prophecies. If we expect
these children to fail, they will fail. It is time to realize that
getting angry and punishing the mother is not in the best
interests of either the mother or the child. It is time that
we develop a national consensus on how to deal with
maternal prenatal drug use that does justice to the state-
of-the-art knowledge in research and treatment and dem-
onstrates a fair and unbiased attitude towards these
women and their children.
