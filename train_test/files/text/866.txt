Aspirin therapy to prevent cardiovascu-
lar disease (CVD) may be particularly
beneficial for people with diabetes.
First, people with diabetes are two to four
times as likely to develop CVD as people
without diabetes (1). Second, people with
diabetes have been observed to have altered
platelet function with increased production
of thromboxane (2,3), and the primary way
in which aspirin reduces the risk of CVD is
through its effects on platelet function result-
ing in reduced thromboxane synthesis (4).
Aspirin has been shown to be an effec-
tive and relatively safe treatment for people
with diabetes. Trials have demonstrated
that aspirin therapy can prevent the first
heart attack, stroke, or other indication of
CVD (primary prevention) (5,7,8) and also
subsequent cardiovascular events (sec-
ondary prevention) (6­8) without any
significant increase in retinal or vitreous
hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, or
hemorrhagic stroke (7).
The American Diabetes Association
(ADA) published guidelines for aspirin ther-
apy in adults with diabetes in 1997 (8,9)
and reissued them, with minor revisions, in
2000 (10). The ADA recommends that, in
the absence of specific contraindications,
aspirin should 1) be used for secondary
prevention by men and women with evi-
dence of large vessel disease (myocardial
infarction, vascular bypass procedure,
stroke, transient ischemic attack, or angina)
and 2) be considered for primary preven-
tion in adults who have one or more risk
factors for CVD (family history of coronary
heart disease, smoking, hypertension, obe-
sity, albuminuria, or lipid abnormalities) or
who are 30 years of age. Doses of 81­325
mg/day of enteric-coated aspirin are
advised. Specific contraindications cited by
the ADA include aspirin allergy, bleeding
tendency, anticoagulant therapy, recent gas-
trointestinal bleeding, and clinically active
liver disease. The ADA notes that the use of
aspirin has not been studied in individuals
with diabetes who are 30 years of age and
that aspirin should not be recommended
for those 21 years because of the risk of
Reye's syndrome (10).
In this report, we use the ADA guide-
lines and a nationally representative sample
to estimate the percentage of adults with
diabetes who are potential candidates for
aspirin therapy and the prevalence of regu-
lar aspirin use among such individuals.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) was conducted in 1988­1994
and used a probability sample of the U.S.
civilian noninstitutionalized population
(11). Participants were asked to complete a
household interview and then a physical
examination that included the collection of
blood and urine samples (12). In all, 18,460
individuals 21 years of age (81% of those
eligible) completed the household interview.

Aspirin Use Among Adults With Diabetes
Estimates from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey
O R I G I N A L A R T I C L E
OBJECTIVE -- Since 1997, the American Diabetes Association has recommended that
aspirin therapy be considered for adults with diabetes who have cardiovascular disease (CVD)
or CVD risk factors. We examined the prevalence of regular aspirin use among adults in the
U.S. with diagnosed diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- The Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (1988­1994) used a probability sample of the U.S. population and
included an interview, physical examination, and laboratory studies. Among the survey par-
ticipants were 1,503 adults (age 21 years) with self-reported diabetes. We defined regular
aspirin use as reported having taken aspirin 15 times in the previous month. CVD conditions
were self-reported heart attack and stroke and symptoms of angina and claudication. CVD risk
factors included smoking, hypertension, obesity, albuminuria, lipid abnormalities, and family
history of heart attack.
RESULTS -- An estimated 27% of adults with diabetes had CVD, and an additional 71% had
one or more CVD risk factors. Aspirin was used regularly by 37% of those with CVD and by
13% of those with risk factors only. Adjusted odds of regular aspirin use were significantly
greater for individuals with CVD than for those with one CVD risk factor (odds ratio [OR] =
4.3); for non-Hispanic whites than for blacks, Mexican-Americans, and others (OR = 2.5); and
for individuals age 40­59 years than for those 40 years (OR = 33.3).
CONCLUSIONS -- Nearly every adult in the U.S. with diabetes has at least one risk factor
for CVD and thus may be considered a potential candidate for aspirin therapy. During
1988­1994, only 20% (95% CI 16­23) took aspirin regularly. Major efforts are needed to
increase aspirin use.

Aspirin use among adults with diabetes in the U.S.
Our primary sample for this study consisted
of the 1,503 interview participants (658
men, 845 women) age 21 years with diag-
nosed diabetes (11). Women who reported
that they were diagnosed only during preg-
nancy were not included.
Participants were classified as regular
aspirin users if they reported taking aspirin
15 times in the month before the inter-
view. This definition was designed to cap-
ture alternate-day as well as daily use, both
of which have been found effective for pre-
venting CVD (5,7).The two relevant ques-
tions were, "In the past month have you
taken any aspirin, Anacin, Bufferin,
Ecotrin, Ascriptin, or Midol?" and a follow-
up question, "How often did you take
[aspirin] during the past month?" The dis-
tribution of "how often" had a prominent
spike at 30, which is consistent with daily
therapeutic use. We believe that those who
did not know whether or how much
aspirin they had taken were unlikely to
have been regular users. Therefore, we clas-
sified individuals who did not answer both
the initial and follow-up questions as non-
regular users along with those who took
aspirin 0­14 times in the previous month.
We defined CVD as the presence of one
or more of four conditions (heart attack,
stroke, possible angina, and lower-extremity
claudication). Heart attack and stroke were
both identified by self-report of a previous
diagnosis; history of possible angina and
lower-extremity claudication were deter-
mined from responses to the Rose question-
naire (13). We included six CVD risk factors
in our analysis (family history of heart attack,
smoking, obesity, hypertension, albumin-
uria, and dyslipidemia) and defined them to
mirror their definitions in the ADA guide-
lines (10) (see footnote to Table 2). Age 30
years was treated as a separate risk factor, as
it was in the ADA guidelines. Individuals
with a missing or "unknown" response for a
CVD condition or risk factor were consid-
ered to not have that condition.
We used the interview sample (n =
1,503 individuals with diabetes) to estimate
the percentage of all adults with diabetes
who had each of the four CVD conditions
and the prevalence of aspirin use among
those with each condition. Among individ-
uals with diabetes but without any of the
four CVD conditions, we estimated the per-
centage that had each of the six CVD risk
factors, or age 30 years, and the preva-
lence of aspirin use among those with each
risk factor. Here we used interview, physical
examination, laboratory, and morning (fast-
ing) subsamples (n = 1,092, 974, 932, and
429 individuals, respectively, with diabetes
but without CVD).
We used the subsample (n = 1,265) of
all diabetic participants with laboratory
results available to estimate the distribution
of adults with diabetes across four cate-
gories distinguished in the ADA guidelines
and the prevalence of aspirin use in each of
those groups. BMI, urinary albumin, HDL,
and total cholesterol were available for most
of these participants, but LDL and triglyc-
eride values were available only for those
examined in the morning after fasting.
We used logistic regression to test
whether CVD or number of CVD risk fac-
tors, age, sex, race or ethnicity, family
income, education, and health insurance
coverage (any vs. none) were associated
with regular aspirin use among adults with
diabetes and CVD or one or more risk fac-
tors. Diabetes duration (in years), self-
reported insulin use, and HbA
1c
(levels 8,
8­10, or 10) were included in the analy-
sis as indicators of disease severity that
might be associated with the prescription of
aspirin therapy. Additionally, we modeled
regular aspirin use among all adults, with
and without diabetes, who had CVD, one
or more CVD risk factors, or age 30 years
(n = 15,718) and tested whether diabetes
was significantly associated with aspirin
use after adjusting for the effects of age, race
or ethnicity, CVD, and other demographic
variables. We used the Wald F statistic to
test main effects and interactions, and com-
puted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs to
compare levels of explanatory variables. To
assess whether there was a temporal trend,
we compared the first 3-year phase of the
survey with the second (each phase pro-
vided an independent national estimate).
We used SUDAAN (14) for estimation
and regression modeling. All of our analy-
ses account for the clustered design and
planned oversampling and adjust for dif-
ferential noncoverage and nonresponse
(12). Separate weights were used for the
interview, examination, laboratory, and
morning (fasting) samples, permitting
appropriate inference from every sample to
the population of adults in the U.S. with
diagnosed diabetes.
RESULTS -- We estimated that among
all U.S. adults with diabetes, 63% took
aspirin 0 times in the previous month;
16%, 1­14 times; 2%, 15­29 times; 16%,
30 times, and 2%, 30­122 times (2% had
an unknown level of use). Therefore, by
our definition, 18% of adults with diabetes
were regular aspirin users in 1988­1994.
Among adults with diabetes, heart
attack was the most prevalent (14%) of four
CVD conditions (Table 1). Only 39% of
those with diabetes and a history of heart
attack were regular aspirin users. The esti-
mated prevalence of aspirin use was highest
(70%) among individuals with symptoms
of claudication, but only 30 individuals in
our sample reported such symptoms.
Among adults with diabetes who did
not have CVD (Table 2), the prevalence of
individual CVD risk factors ranged from
8% (family history of heart attack) to 92%
(dyslipidemia) and 98% (age 30 years).
Aspirin was used regularly by 17% of
those with each of these risk factors.
We estimated that 27% of U.S. adults
with diabetes had CVD (one or more of
four conditions) and that 37% of those
with CVD used aspirin regularly (Table 3).
Among those without CVD but with one or
more of six CVD risk factors (71% of all
adults with diabetes), 13% used aspirin
regularly. We found that 99% of the U.S.
adult diabetes population fell into one of
the three categories (CVD, one or more
CVD risk factors, or age 30 years) of
individuals for whom the ADA recom-
mends that aspirin therapy be used or con-
sidered. In this combined group, only 20%
(95% CI 16­23) used aspirin regularly.
CVD, race or ethnicity, and age were
significantly associated with regular aspirin
use among individuals with diabetes who
could be considered candidates for aspirin
therapy per the ADA recommendation

(Table 4). The odds of regular aspirin use
were 4.3 times as great for people with CVD
as for those with zero or one CVD risk fac-
tors, but having a larger number of CVD risk
factors was not significantly associated with
increased odds of aspirin use. Non-Hispanic
whites were 2.5 times as likely to use aspirin
regularly as non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican-
Americans, or individuals of other races. The
odds of regular aspirin use, which increased
with age, were greater for individuals 40
years than for those 21­39 years of age.
We found no statistically significant dif-
ferences in regular aspirin use by sex, edu-
cational attainment, or family income.
Insulin use, duration of diabetes, HbA
1c
,
and health insurance coverage were not
found to be associated with aspirin use and
were not included in the final model. None
of the two-way interactions between CVD,
age, race, and sex was significant; the sam-
ple size was inadequate for testing higher-
order interactions. There was no evidence of
a temporal trend: among people with dia-
betes who had CVD or risk factors, 19.3%
used aspirin regularly during the first phase,
and 19.9% used it during the second phase.
Compared with people who did not
have diagnosed diabetes, people with dia-
betes were somewhat more likely to take
aspirin regularly (20 vs. 10% overall, 37 vs.
31% among those with CVD, and 13 vs. 9%
among those with CVD risk factors). We
found no significant association, however,
between regular aspirin use and having dia-
betes (OR = 1.02; 95% CI 0.78­1.35) after
adjusting for CVD, race, and age. Here, as in
the diabetes subgroup, CVD, white race,
and older age were most strongly associated
with regular aspirin use. We also found that
in this expanded population, aspirin was
significantly more likely to be used by men
than by women. Once again, there was no
evidence of a temporal trend.
CONCLUSIONS -- Based on a nation-
ally representative sample, we estimated
that 99% of U.S. adults with diagnosed
diabetes in 1988­1994 had CVD or at least
one CVD risk factor. Aspirin was used reg-
ularly by 20% of such individuals. Among
those with established CVD (27% of people
with diabetes), for whom the value of
aspirin therapy for secondary prevention is
unequivocal (6,7,10,15), 37% reported
regular use. Among those without CVD
but with one or more CVD risk factors
(71% of adults with diabetes), a group for
whom aspirin therapy should be consid-
ered for primary prevention (5,7,10,16),
13% were regular users.
Diabetes-specific guidelines for aspirin
therapy (10) were not published until
1997. However, the potential benefits of
aspirin therapy for primary prevention of
CVD were widely publicized beginning
with the release, in January 1988, of a pre-
liminary report on the Physician's Health
Study (5), and more general guidelines for
secondary prevention were developed and
published during the study period (17,18).
In this context, our estimates of the preva-
lence of regular aspirin use seem quite low,
and it is somewhat surprising that aspirin
use did not increase during the second
phase of the survey.
The argument in favor of aggressive
efforts to prevent CVD in people with dia-
betes is overwhelming. The risk of myocar-
dial infarction is as high for diabetic patients
who have never had an infarction as it is for
other patients who have (1). People with
diabetes are not only at greater risk for CVD
than those without the disease, but they are
also more likely to die from CVD (19,20).In
our study, the presence of diabetes was not
associated with increased odds of regular
aspirin use among U.S. adults after account-
ing for differences in the distributions of
CVD, race, and age. A study conducted in
Israel in 1990­1992 among individuals
aged 45­74 years with coronary artery dis-
ease supports our finding: researchers there
found similarly little difference in the preva-
lence of aspirin use between those with dia-
betes (52%) and others (56%) (21). Also, a

recent survey of members of a U.S. health
maintenance organization found that those
with diagnosed diabetes had significantly
lower adjusted odds of using aspirin to
prevent heart disease than those without
diabetes (22).
We can suggest several possible rea-
sons for the low rates of aspirin use among
people with diabetes. We have mentioned
the absence, before 1997, of diabetes-spe-
cific guidelines. It is conceivable that physi-
cians have had an exaggerated perception of
the risks of aspirin therapy for people with
diabetes, particularly those with retinopathy
or hypertension. Results from the Early
Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study
(ETDRS) and the Hypertension Optimal
Treatment (HOT) trial should be noted. The
ETDRS used a relatively high dose of aspirin
(650 mg/day) in people with diabetes and
retinopathy, yet showed no significant
increase in the risk of severe complications
(7). In the HOT study, which included
1,501 patients with diabetes, 75 mg/day of
aspirin reduced the risk of myocardial
infarction, with no effect on stroke or fatal
bleeds (23). It is also possible that patients
with more severe diabetes may be less moti-
vated to comply with recommendations for
medications. Such patients are often pre-
scribed multiple therapies, among which
aspirin may be perceived as relatively unim-
portant. However, in our study, we exam-
ined several markers for diabetes severity
(duration, HbA
1c
level, and insulin use) and
found that none was associated with regu-
lar aspirin use.
Among our most important findings, in
the population of individuals with diabetes
and CVD or risk factors, aspirin was less
likely to be used by blacks and Mexican-
Americans than by non-Hispanic whites,
even after adjusting for differences in age,
CVD, and number of CVD risk factors. This
difference was not explained by measured
differences in income or education. In addi-
tion, younger people were much less likely
to use aspirin than older people. Among all
adults (those with diabetes and others) with
CVD or risk factors, aspirin was less likely to
be used by women than by men. Others
have observed similar differences in aspirin
use (24­26), and we note reports that other
CVD treatments may be underused by eth-
nic minorities in the U.S. (27,28).
Several factors could have biased our
results. Although it is likely that some of
the regular aspirin users in our sample did
not use aspirin expressly for CVD benefit
(29), it is important to note that the risk of
CVD is reduced by regular use of aspirin for
any purpose (including arthritis and pain
relief). It is also possible that we counted as
regular aspirin users a few people who took
frequent doses of aspirin for a short time,
but not for most of the month, or misclas-
sified as nonregular users some who did
not know how much aspirin they took.
Our measure of CVD did not include
history of vascular bypass or transient
ischemic attack, and some of our lipid mea-
sures were available only for NHANES III
participants who had fasted overnight, yet
we still found that 98% of all adults with
diabetes had CVD or one or more CVD risk
factors. Unfortunately, we were unable to
estimate the prevalence of specific con-
traindications to aspirin therapy.
The NHANES III data provide national
baseline estimates for measuring improve-
ments in the quality of care received by peo-
ple with diabetes. Approximately 10.2
million U.S. adults have diagnosed diabetes
(34). Low cost (about $1.50/month for
enteric-coated preparations) and ready avail-
ability make aspirin practical for widespread
use. Our study suggests that as many as 8
million people with diabetes who are poten-
tial candidates for aspirin therapy are not
using this effective treatment. Clearly, exten-
sive efforts are needed to increase aspirin use
among people with diabetes, and racial and
ethnic minorities should be targeted in these
efforts. Using guidelines, educating patients,
involving opinion leaders, and carrying out
other similar interventions can potentially
achieve the goal of increasing aspirin use
(30). Preventive measures should be moni-
tored, and the effectiveness of existing guide-
lines should be evaluated (31). Including
aspirin in the Diabetes Quality Improve-
ment Program measure sets (32) and in the
Health Plan Employer Data and Information
Set (33) as a measure of the quality of care
received by people with diabetes might also
encourage regular use.
There are important contraindications
to aspirin use, and even in the absence of
these, the individual's level of cardiovascu-
lar risk must be weighed against the small

larly among those 30 years of age. Still,
our data suggest that nearly every U.S. adult
with diagnosed diabetes has at least one
measurable risk factor for CVD and thus
may be considered a potential candidate
for aspirin therapy (10).
