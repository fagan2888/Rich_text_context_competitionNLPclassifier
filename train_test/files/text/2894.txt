At Your Service! The Role of Tax Havens in
International Trade with Services
Abstract
This paper documents that tax havens play a prominent role in international service trade and
investigates the nature of this role. We employ a firm-level dataset with detailed information
about service trade and foreign affiliates for virtually all multinational firms in Germany, which
allows us to approximately distinguish trade between related and unrelated parties. We find that
the service trade of tax havens partly reflects genuine specialization in service industries, which
suggests that institutional features such as low tax rates, secrecy and low regulatory standards
create a comparative advantage in service production. We also find that trade in service
categories such as intellectual property (patents and trademarks) and headquarter services
(administration, management and advertising) partly reflects mispriced affiliate trade serving to
shift profits to tax havens. We argue, however, that the loss of government revenue resulting
from this type of corporate tax evasion is likely to be modest.

1 Introduction
One of the most remarkable features of the globalization wave in recent decades is the explosive
growth in international trade with services. Service trade has consistently grown at higher
rates than goods trade and, today, commercial services account for roughly 20% of the total
international trade (WTO, 2013).
This paper argues that the rise in international service trade cannot be fully understood
without accounting for the role of tax havens: jurisdictions with extremely low e¤ective tax
rates often combined with low regulatory standards and legal institutions facilitating secrecy.
We substantiate this claim by showing that in all the OECD countries, for which a bilateral
breakdown of service trade 
ows is available, the share of trade that is conducted with tax havens
is substantially higher for services than for goods. Simple gravity models of aggregate trade

ows show that service trade with tax havens is around 6 times larger than with comparable
countries that are not tax havens whereas no such di¤erence exists in goods trade.
A priori there are at least two plausible explanations for the striking role of tax havens
in international service trade. First, the speci...c institutions developed by tax havens may
create a comparative advantage in services. For instance, bank secrecy and tax exemption
of investment funds have spurred the development of a large ...nancial sector in Luxembourg,
which trades a wide range of services on the global ...nancial market. Ship management on
Cyprus and reinsurance on Bermuda are other examples of genuine and highly specialized
service industries that have emerged in response to the tax and regulatory incentives o¤ered
by tax havens. Second, service trade may serve as a tax evasion strategy for multinational
...rms. When tax haven entities sell overpriced services to a¢ liated entities elsewhere, taxable
pro...ts are e¤ectively shifted to tax havens with low or no taxation, which reduces the ...rm'
s
global tax bill. Anecdotally, multinational ...rms are known to operate tax haven entities such as
"patent boxes" that own intellectual property and collect royalties and license fees from a¢ liates;
"captive insurance companies" that insure the risks of a¢ liates in exchange for insurance fees;
and "headquarters" that assist a¢ liates with management, administration or advertising against
service fees. These transactions are all classi...ed as service trade in international trade statistics,
but typically have no or little real substance and serve no other purpose than tax evasion.
The rest of the paper explores the nature of the service trade with tax havens: does it re
ect
real agglomerations of service industries in tax havens or tax evasion by multinational ...rms?
2
Our empirical strategy involves two steps. First, we break down the "excess" service trade with
tax havens into trade between unrelated parties, which must re
ect genuine specialization in
service industries, and trade between related parties, which may re
ect tax-motivated pro...t
shifting. Second, we study whether tax haven entities selling services to a¢ liates exhibit "ex-
cess" pro...tability, which would indicate that these transactions involve an element of pro...t
shifting.
To conduct this analysis, it is necessary to go beyond aggregate trade statistics. Therefore,
we combine two German data sources to construct a ...rm-level dataset that contains information
about service trade as well as foreign direct investment. For each German ...rm, we observe the
value of its service imports and exports by foreign counterpart country and service category as
well as the location and basic characteristics of its foreign a¢ liates.
Our baseline regression model explains the extensive margins of service trade with the fol-
lowing three key variables: a dummy indicating whether the partner country in question is a tax
haven; a dummy indicating whether the ...rm in question has an a¢ liate in the partner country;
and the interaction between the tax haven and a¢ liate dummies. In addition, we include stan-
dard gravity controls as well as ...rm ...xed e¤ects that absorb all ...rm-level determinants of trade
such as ...rm age, size and sector. The tax haven dummy measures the probability of a German
...rm trading with a haven in which it has no a¢ liates over and above the probability of trading
with an otherwise similar non-tax haven in which it has no a¢ liates; a measure of excess trade
with unrelated parties in tax havens. The interaction between the tax haven and subsidiary
dummies measures the probability of a German ...rm trading with a tax haven in which it has
an a¢ liate over and above the probability of trading with an otherwise similar non-tax haven
in which it has an a¢ liate; a measure of excess trade with a¢ liates in tax havens.
We ...nd strong evidence of excess trade with unrelated parties in tax havens across vir-
tually all service categories. The excess probability that a given ...rm imports from a given
tax haven where it has no a¢ liates is between 0.1 and 1 percentage point depending on the
service category. Precisely because this ...nding applies to trade between unrelated parties, it
implies that tax havens sell more genuine services on the world market than can be explained
by their fundamental economic and geographical characteristics, which we interpret as evidence
of specialization in services. The excess probability that a ...rm exports to a tax haven where it
has no a¢ liates is between 0.1 and 0.4 percentage points. This ...nding plausibly re
ects that
service agglomerations in tax havens rely on service inputs from foreign providers; for instance,
Luxembourg banks may acquire ...nancial services on the world market just like Cypriot ship-
3
ping companies buy shipping-related services and Bermuda reinsurance companies purchase
insurance-related services from unrelated ...rms abroad.
Moreover, for certain service categories often anecdotally associated with tax evasion, we
...nd positive excess imports from a¢ liates in tax havens, but negative excess exports. For ex-
ample, if a ...rm has an a¢ liate in a foreign country, the probability of observing trade 
ows
related to intellectual property between the ...rm and the foreign country generally increases by
around 5 percentage points for both imports and exports. However, if the foreign country is
a tax haven, the e¤ect on imports is around 7.5 percentage points and the e¤ect on exports
only around 2.5 percentage points. We ...nd evidence of positive excess imports from a¢ liates in
tax havens combined with negative excess exports in four major service categories: intellectual
property (such as services related to patents and trademarks), headquarter services (such as ad-
ministration and management), information services and sea transport. The ...rst two categories
are often considered to be especially prone to transfer mispricing because of the di¢ culty of
establishing market prices for such services (e.g. OECD, 2013) while the latter is closely linked
to tax havens by the extensive use of 
ags of convenience.
The ...nding that a¢ liate trade with tax havens is heavily skewed towards imports is clearly
consistent with pro...t shifting. It is precisely the pattern that should be expected if multinational
...rms operate tax haven entities serving solely to sell mispriced or even purely ...ctitious services
to a¢ liates. However, the ...nding could also, in principle, re
ect that multinational ...rms
allocate a disproportionate share of their genuine service production to a¢ liates in tax havens
while trading services internally at market prices. We therefore go beyond the analysis of trade
patterns and study the pro...tability of foreign a¢ liates directly.
Our methodology e¤ectively compares entities belonging to the same ...rm and selling the
same service to their German a¢ liates. We ...nd that for certain service categories, notably
intellectual property, headquarter services and sea transport where a¢ liate trade with tax havens
is signi...cantly skewed toward imports, tax haven a¢ liates earn signi...cantly higher pro...ts than
non-haven a¢ liates. The excess return of tax haven a¢ liates is between 4 and 8 percentage
points depending on the service category, which compares to normal returns between 10 and
15 percent in the comparison group of non-haven a¢ liates. Relatedly, we show that patterns in
service trade correlate strongly with the intra-...rm allocation of pro...ts. Speci...cally, ...rms with
less than 20% of total service imports coming from tax havens typically allocate below 30%
of their foreign pro...ts to tax havens whereas ...rms importing 50% or more from tax havens
allocate around 50% of their foreign pro...ts to tax havens. These results suggest that some
4
a¢ liate trade is mispriced and has an economically signi...cant e¤ect on the global allocation of
pro...ts within multinational ...rms.
Finally, we present suggestive evidence that service trade between German ...rms and their
tax haven a¢ liates is funneled through entities in third countries; in particular the Netherlands,
which has been identi...ed by other studies as the conduit country typically used by German
...rms for holding purposes (e.g. Mintz and Weichenrieder, 2010). Speci...cally, we show that
excess probabilities of imports from tax haven a¢ liates in service categories such as intellectual
property and headquarter services are signi...cantly lower for German ...rms that have an a¢ l-
iate in the Netherlands. This is consistent with services 
owing from tax havens through the
Netherlands to Germany, which decreases observed imports from tax haven a¢ liates, but only
for ...rms that have an a¢ liate in the Netherlands. The conduit trade may serve to circumvent
withholding taxes or other anti-avoidance measures that apply only to transactions with tax
havens (Johannesen, 2012).
The paper adds to a large literature studying how multinational ...rms shift pro...ts between
jurisdictions with the aim of reducing their global tax bill. A number of papers show that the
transformation of productive inputs into taxable pro...ts by multinational ...rms correlates with
tax rates in ways that are suggestive of tax motivated pro...t shifting (e.g. Hines and Rice, 1994;
Huizinga and Laeven, 2008). Other papers study the distinct channels through which pro...ts are
shifted such as mispricing of goods traded inside the ...rm (e.g. Clausing, 2003; Bernard, Jensen
and Schott, 2008; Christea and Nguyen, 2015); the allocation of debt within the ...rm (e.g. Desai,
Foley and Hines, 2004; Huizinga, Laeven and Nicodeme, 2008); and the allocation of patents
and other intangible assets within the ...rm (e.g. Dieschinger and Riedel, 2011; Karkinsky and
Riedel, 2012) as well as the resulting 
ows of royalties (e.g. Grubert, 1998). We are not aware
of any existing papers studying trade in services as a mode of pro...t shifting.
Moreover, the paper contributes to a broader empirical literature that investigates the trade
boom in services in terms of its causes, for instance Jensen (2011) on enhanced tradability of
services and Francois and Hoekman (2010) on reduced non-tari¤ barriers to trade; its conse-
quences, for instance Haskel et al. (2012) on increased income inequality, Tre
er and Liu (2008)
on depressed earnings of domestic workers and Arnold, Javorcik, Mattoo (2011) on increased
productivity of downstream manufacturing ...rms; as well as its anatomy, for instance Breinlich
and Criscuolo (2011) on the heterogeneity across service ...rms in the propensity to trade and
Kelle et al. (2013) on the relative importance of direct service exports and service sales through
foreign a¢ liates. To the best of our knowledge, no existing papers link the rise of international
5
service trade to tax and regulatory arbitrage.
Finally, our ...ndings relate to a growing body of literature attempting to shed light on the
use of tax havens by multinational ...rms (Hines and Rice, 1994; Desai et al., 2006; Hebous
and Lipatov, 2014; Zucman, 2014; Bennedsen and Zeume, 2015); wealthy individuals (Zucman,
2013; Zucman and Johannesen, 2014; Johannesen, 2014; Hanlon et al., 2014); and political elites
in autocracies (Andersen et al., 2014).
The paper proceeds in the following way. Section 2 presents evidence on the role of tax
havens in international trade based on aggregate trade 
ows. Section 3 describes the German
...rm-level data on service trade and foreign investment. Section 4 discusses the empirical strat-
egy. Section 5 reports the results. Section 6 provides some concluding remarks.
2 Aggregate trade patterns
This section analyzes the role of tax havens in international trade using publicly available data
from OECD trade statistics. Speci...cally, we rely on bilateral trade information from 2011,
which is available for 34 countries for goods and 26 countries for services.
In a ...rst step, we show that tax havens play a far more prominent role in service trade than
goods trade by plotting the share of service trade that is conducted with tax havens against the
corresponding share in goods trade. Our list of tax havens follows Hines (2010) and includes 50
countries ranging from well-known tax havens like Switzerland, Singapore and Bermuda to more
unknown jurisdictions like Anguilla, Andorra and Vanuatu. As shown in Figure 1, tax havens
are more important partners in service trade than goods trade for all countries in the sample.
In Germany and France, for instance, tax havens account for around 15% of the service trade
but only a little more than 5% of goods trade; in the UK, tax havens account for almost 20% of
the service trade and roughly 10% of the goods trade; and, most extremely, in the Netherlands,
tax havens account for almost 25% of the service trade and a mere 5% of the goods trade.
Figure 1 somewhere around here
In a second step, we quantify the extent to which trade with tax havens exceeds trade with
comparable non-haven countries by estimating a standard gravity model augmented with tax
variables. The results are reported in Table 1; all standard errors are clustered by reporting
country and by partner country. Column (1) shows that conditional on economic size, geography
and other standard controls, a dummy for being a tax haven is a very strong predictor of service
trade. The coe¢ cient of 1.79 implies that service trade is around 500% percent larger for country
6
pairs where at least one of the countries is a tax haven than for otherwise comparable country
pairs. Column (2) shows that this result does not extend to goods trade. The point estimate
suggests tax havens trade around 16% more goods than comparable non-havens, which is not
statistically distinguishable from zero.
Table 1 somewhere around here
These patterns are very robust. For instance, the coe¢ cient on the tax haven dummy barely
changes when we include higher-order terms of the GDP and distance variables to address the
concern that tax havens are systematically smaller than other countries, which could lead to
a biased coe¢ cient on the tax haven dummy if trade is not log-linear in GDP conditional on
any tax e¤ects. The point estimate drops somewhat when the gravity equation is estimated on
its multiplicative form as suggested by Silva and Tenreyro (2006), but still implies excess trade
with tax havens in services above 200%. By comparison, point estimates are consistently small
and statistically insigni...cant in the goods equation.
In the baseline regression, we lumped together country pairs where only one country is a tax
haven and those where both countries are tax havens in a single tax haven dummy. Column (3)
shows that the service trade e¤ect is markedly di¤erent in the two cases: the coe¢ cient of 1.67
for country pairs with only one tax haven corresponds to a trade e¤ect of around 430% whereas
the coe¢ cient of 4.21 for country pairs with two tax havens corresponds to a trade e¤ect of a
staggering 6600%. Column (4) shows that there is no signi...cant e¤ect on goods trade in any
of the two cases.
The very sizable trade in services between tax havens strongly suggests that simple pro...t
shifting from high-tax to low-tax countries cannot fully account for the important role of tax
havens in international service trade. A possible explanation, which we will investigate further
later in the paper, is that services are traded through chains of entities belonging to the same
...rm. In the tax planning employed by Microsoft, Google and other global ...rms, for instance, the
right to exploit the ...rm'
s intellectual property is licensed from a shell corporation in Bermuda
to another shell corporation in the Netherlands, on to a corporation in Ireland and ...nally on
to sales o¢ ces in a number of di¤erent countries (Kleinbard, 2011).1 Such structures generate
service trade 
ows between tax havens that can be very large relative to the size of the tax

Robinson (2013).

haven economies.
While the aggregate trade statistics point to a prominent role of tax havens in international
service trade, they do not allow us to investigate this role further by considering trade between
related and unrelated entities separately or analyzing individual service categories. In the
remainder of the paper, we therefore turn to more disaggregated data.
3 Firm-level data
We combine information from two ...rm-level datasets compiled by the Deutsche Bundesbank.
First, we use information on service trade from the Statistics on international trade in services
collected for the purposes of the balance of payments statistics. In this dataset, we observe for
each German corporation the value of its service imports and exports by counterpart country
and service category.2 Second, we use information on foreign a¢ liates from the Microdatabase
Direct Investment (MIDI). In this dataset, we observe for each German corporation the basic
characteristics of its foreign a¢ liates, such as their turnover, pro...ts, equity and location, both
directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and parent companies.3 Merging these two data
sources, we obtain a ...rm-level dataset on service trade and foreign a¢ liates, which is augmented
with country-level variables such as GDP, tax haven status, distance to Germany and shared
language with Germany4.
It should be emphasized that the data do not allow us to distinguish trade between related
and unrelated entities without error. First, when a ...rm trades with a country in which we
observe an a¢ liate, this could very well be trade with the a¢ liate, but might also be trade with
another unrelated entity. Second, trade with a country in which we do not observe an a¢ liate is
most likely trade with an unrelated entity, but could in principle be trade with an a¢ liate that
we do not observe in our dataset. That could happen if the trading partner is a subsidiary of a
foreign parent (i.e., a foreign sister) for which there is no reporting requirement to the Deutsche
Bundesbank.
In Table 2, we provide an overview of the aggregate patterns in our ...rm-level dataset. For
each of the 11 broad service categories with aggregate trade exceeding e5 billion, we report

3 Foreign subsidiaries are included if (i) the value of their total assets exceeds e3 million and (ii) the German
parent holds a direct ownership share exceeding 10% or one of its subsidiaries holds a direct ownership share
exceeding 50%. For a detailed description of the data, see Biewen et al. (2013) and Lipponer (2011).

the total value of German ...rms'imports and exports with breakdowns on whether the partner
country is a tax haven or not and whether a foreign a¢ liate is present in the partner country
or not. The table establishes a number of interesting facts. First, Germany has a considerable
trade de...cit in services with imports around e250 billion and exports around e220 billion.
The largest service categories in terms of total trade are Sea transport, Intellectual property,
Air transport and, most importantly, Other business services. Second, Germany has a small
trade surplus against tax havens with exports around e40 billion and imports slightly below
that. The share of tax havens in the service trade, however, varies widely across categories with
particularly high tax haven shares in Financial services, Sea transport, Information services and
Other business services (20-30%) and low tax haven shares in Air transport and Road transport
(5-7%). Third, trade with tax havens in which the trading ...rm has an a¢ liate and which
is therefore plausibly intra-...rm amounts to around e11 billion of imports and e8 of exports.
The intra-...rm share of tax haven imports also di¤ers signi...cantly across services with high
intra-...rm shares in Intellectual property and Other business services (30-50%) and a low share
in Financial services and Construction (15-20%).
In Table 3, we report a breakdown of the two aggregate categories Intellectual property and
Other business services, which are of particular interest in the context of pro...t shifting. The
former can be decomposed into Patents, Trademarks and Research and Development whereas
the latter most prominently contains Headquarter services, Technical services and Advertising
as well as a number of smaller subcategories. The term Headquarter services is used for brevity
and covers commercial, organizational, administrative and management services.
The aggregate patterns reported in Tables 2 and 3 can be used to gauge the magnitude of
pro...t shifting to tax havens occurring through trade in services. Under the extreme assumption
that all service imports from tax havens in which the importing ...rm has an a¢ liate are purely
...ctitious transactions where the acquired service has no actual value, these imports shift e11
billion of corporate tax base out of Germany. With a corporate tax rate around 30%, this gives
an upper bound on the revenue loss due to intra-...rm service imports from tax havens of around
e3 billion. To the extent that some of these imports represent genuine services with a positive
market value, the revenue loss is proportionately smaller. This computation does not account
for the possibility that imports from tax havens are funneled through conduit countries and
thus concealed as imports from other countries. Note, however, that even if a large share of
a¢ liate imports from tax havens is completely ...ctitious and a signi...cant share of total a¢ liate
imports from tax havens pass through conduit entities outside tax havens, the total revenue
9
loss is likely to be quite modest relative to the total German corporate tax revenue of around
e45 billion in 2011.5
4 Empirical model
The baseline model used to study trade patterns is a linear probability model speci...ed in the
following way:
Tradeics = + 1
Havenc + 2
Affiliateic + 3
(Affiliateic Havenc) + i
+ Xc + "ics (1)
where Tradeics is a measure of trade in service s between ...rm i and country c; Affiliateic is a
dummy indicating whether ...rm i has an a¢ liate in country c; Havenc is a dummy indicating
whether country c is a tax haven; i
are ...rm-level ...xed e¤ects that absorb all ...rm characteristics
such as size, sector and overall propensity to engage in cross-border transactions; and Xc is a
vector of country-level gravity controls such as GDP and distance to Germany. We study
the two external margins of trade by varying the dependent variable: Importics is a dummy
indicating whether ...rm i imports service s from country c and Exportics is a dummy variable
indicating whether ...rm i exports service s to country c. The model is estimated for each of the
two trade measures and for each service category separately.
We interpret the coe¢ cients on the three key variables in the following way: First, the
coe¢ cient on Tax Haven measures the average trade of a German ...rm with a tax haven in
which it has no a¢ liates over and above its trade with an otherwise similar non-tax haven
in which it has no a¢ liates. This is a measure of excess trade with unrelated parties in tax
havens. Second, the coe¢ cient on Affiliate measures the average trade of a German ...rm with
a non-tax haven in which it has an a¢ liate over and above its trade with an otherwise similar
non-tax haven in which it has no a¢ liates. It is natural to interpret this as a measure of a¢ liate
trade, but caution is warranted because the presence of a foreign a¢ liate could also a¤ect trade
with unrelated parties. For instance, a foreign a¢ liate could promote transactions between its
German parent and unrelated parties, in which case 2
overestimates a¢ liate trade, or replace
the German parent in transactions with unrelated parties, in which case it underestimates
a¢ liate trade. Finally, the coe¢ cient on the interaction between Tax Haven and Affiliate
measures the average trade of a German ...rm with a tax haven in which it has an a¢ liate

employing rich ...rm-level data tend to ...nd less pro...t shifting than earlier studies.
10
over and above its trade with an otherwise similar non-tax haven in which it has an a¢ liate.
This is a measure of excess trade with a¢ liates in tax havens. Note that even if 2
does not
correctly identify a¢ liate trade because of the confounding e¤ect of a¢ liates on trade with
related parties, 1
and 3
correctly identify excess trade provided that this e¤ect is the same
in tax havens and other countries.
It should be noted that the presence of ...rm ...xed e¤ects in the model implies that the
variables of interest are identi...ed exclusively from within-...rm comparisons. E¤ectively, we are
comparing a ...rm'
s trade with tax havens to the same ...rm'
s trade with non-tax havens and a
...rm'
s trade with countries in which it has an a¢ liate to the same ...rm'
s trade with countries
in which it has no a¢ liates while holding constant country characteristics such as GDP and
distance to Germany.
The model allows us to test the following hypotheses. If multinational ...rms operate tax
haven entities that serve to sell mispriced or ...ctitious services to other a¢ liates, we should
expect: a higher probability of observing imports from a¢ liates in tax havens than from a¢ liates
in comparable countries ( 3
> 0 in the imports equation) and a lower probability of observing
exports ( 3
< 0 in the exports equation). Moreover, if tax havens specialize in the production
of real services, we should expect: a higher probability of observing imports from unrelated
parties in tax havens than from unrelated parties in comparable countries ( 1
> 0 in the
imports equation). The probability of observing exports to unrelated parties in tax havens
could be lower than for other countries if local service sectors in tax havens tend to saturate
their own domestic market ( 1
< 0 in the export equation) or higher than for other countries
if local service sectors in tax havens tend to rely on intra-industry inputs from foreign ...rms
( 1
> 0 in the export equation). To be concrete, the large ...nancial sector in Luxembourg may
cause purchases of ...nancial services from abroad to be smaller than in comparable countries
because domestic ...rms have ample access to ...nancial services locally, or larger because the
domestic ...nancial sector relies relatively strongly on ...nancial service inputs, some of which are
purchased abroad.
Moreover, we specify the following model to estimate the excess pro...tability of tax haven
entities selling services to a¢ liates:
Profitabilityics = + b1Havenc + i
+ "ics (2)
where Profitabilityics is the book return on equity of an a¢ liate belonging to ...rm i located in
country c from which the ...rm imports service s; Havenc is a dummy indicating whether country
c is a tax haven; and i
are ...rm-level ...xed e¤ects. The book return is winsorized conservatively
11
at the 5% and 95% level. The model is estimated for each service category separately.
In each regression, the sample includes all foreign a¢ liates located in a country from which
the German a¢ liate imports a given service. The ...xed e¤ects absorb ...rm-level di¤erences in
pro...tability, so we are e¤ectively identifying the excess pro...tability of tax haven entities selling
services to their German a¢ liates by comparing to entities in other countries belonging to the
same ...rm selling the same service to their German a¢ liates.

and each of the two trade variables. Firms are included in the sample if they trade the speci...c
service category being studied from at least one foreign country, which implies that the sample
size di¤ers somewhat across service categories. All regressions use a cross-section for the year
2011. Standard errors are clustered at the ...rm-level unless reported otherwise.
Table 4 reports the regression results with Imports as dependent variable. There are three
sets of ...ndings. First, for all service categories there is a positive coe¢ cient on Haven suggest-
ing excess imports from unrelated parties in tax havens. The point estimates range from 0.1
percentage points to more than 1 percentage point depending on the speci...c service category.
To provide a sense of these magnitudes, we report the unconditional probability of trade with
unrelated parties in non-havens at the bottom of the table. The comparison suggests that for
most services, the excess probability of imports from unrelated parties in an average tax haven
is of roughly the same magnitude as the baseline probability of imports from unrelated parties
in an average non-haven.
Second, for all service categories except Sea transport, there are positive coe¢ cients on
Affiliate, which provide rough measures of a¢ liate trade (recall the caveat discussed in the
previous section). The point estimates suggest, for instance, that German ...rms import Air
transport services from less than 1 percent and Other business services from around 20 percent
of its foreign a¢ liates outside tax havens.
Third, for the service categories Information services, Intellectual property, Other business
services, Financial services and Sea transport, there is a positive coe¢ cient on the interaction
between Haven and Affiliate suggesting excess imports from a¢ liates in tax havens. The
signi...cant point estimates range from just below 1 percentage point to almost 3 percentage
12
points. Comparing the coe¢ cients on Haven Affiliate to those on Affiliate suggests that
excess a¢ liate imports range from 10% of normal a¢ liate imports, in Other business services,
to more than 60%, in Financial services. In the remaining categories the coe¢ cient on the
interaction term is indistinguishable from zero, except for Construction where the coe¢ cient
is signi...cantly negative. The coe¢ cients on the covariates are as expected: imports are more
likely when the foreign country is closer, larger and shares a border or an o¢ cial language with
Germany.
Table 4 somewhere around here
In Table 5, we report the results obtained from estimating equation (1) with Exports as the
dependent variable. The generally positive coe¢ cients on Haven suggest that there are excess
exports to unrelated parties in tax havens. The signi...cant point estimates range from less than
0.1 percentage points to 0.4 percentage points and are smaller than in the imports regressions
except in the case of Financial services. The generally positive coe¢ cients on A¢ liate are
suggestive of exports by German ...rms to a¢ liates outside tax havens. For all service categories
except Communication, Insurance services and Financial services, there is a negative coe¢ cient
on the interaction between Haven and Affiliate suggesting that there are negative excess
exports to a¢ liates in tax havens. The coe¢ cients on the covariates suggest that exports, just
like imports, are more likely when the foreign country is closer, larger and shares a border or
an o¢ cial language with Germany.
Table 5 somewhere around here
In the remainder of the paper, we focus on the extensive import margin due to space con-
straints and the fact that imports from tax havens provide clearer and more easily interpretable
evidence on both specialization and pro...t shifting.
In Table 6, we split the sample of ...rms into 3 industrial sectors and provide regression results
for each sector separately. Broadly, there is strong evidence of excess imports from unrelated
parties in tax havens in all three sectors across almost all service categories. Interestingly,
however, the excess imports from a¢ liates in tax havens is concentrated among manufacturing
...rms. Here, the interaction between Haven and Affiliate is positive in more than half of the
service categories and the estimated coe¢ cients are considerably larger than in the full sample,
both in absolute terms and relative to the coe¢ cient on Affiliate. The latter comparison
implies that excess a¢ liate imports approaches or exceeds 100% of normal a¢ liate imports in
13
each of the categories information services, communication services, intellectual property and
sea transport. By contrast, there is little evidence of excess imports from a¢ liates in tax havens
among service ...rms. The main exception to this broad pattern is ...nancial services where excess
imports from tax haven a¢ liates in the full sample appears to be driven primarily by service
...rms.
Table 6 somewhere around here
Finally, in Table 7, we provide regression results for the narrow service categories underlying
the broader categories intellectual property and other business services. These categories are
especially interesting in this context, ...rstly because we have found evidence of trade with tax
haven a¢ liates being skewed toward imports throughout all the speci...cations and, secondly,
because they are both among the broad service categories that contain the most aggregate
trade. The consistently positive coe¢ cients on Tax Haven are clear evidence of excess imports
from unrelated parties in tax havens across all the narrow service categories. By contrast, the
coe¢ cients on the interaction term indicate that excess imports from a¢ liates in tax havens are
concentrated in trade with patents and trademarks within intellectual property, and in trade
with headquarter services and advertising within other business services.
Table 7 somewhere around here
5.2 Pro...tability of foreign a¢ liates
While the patterns of a¢ liate trade are consistent with pro...t shifting to tax havens through
the sale of mispriced services, patterns of pro...tability across foreign a¢ liates can potentially
provide more direct evidence on pro...t shifting. We therefore estimate equation (2) for each of
the 11 broad service categories.
Table 8 shows that tax haven entities selling services to their German a¢ liates have signi...-
cantly higher book returns than other entities belonging to the same ...rm and selling the same
services to German a¢ liates in 5 of the service categories. The excess returns range from around
4 percentage points for Intellectual property to around 8 percentage points for Construction.
By comparison, the mean return of non-tax haven entities selling services to German a¢ liates
(reported at the bottom of the table) ranges from around 8 percent to around 15 percent.
Table 8 somewhere around here
14
The ...nding that tax haven entities engaged in inter-a¢ liate service trade earn excess returns
is highly suggestive that these transactions involve a signi...cant element of pro...t shifting. The
regressions, however, do not inform us about the e¤ect of a¢ liate service trade on the global
allocation of pro...ts within the ...rm.
To shed light on this issue, Figure 2 displays a binned scatterplot of the ratio of tax haven
service imports to total service imports against the ratio of tax haven pro...ts to total foreign
pro...ts. Each blue dot represents the average ratio of tax haven pro...ts to total foreign pro...ts
within a narrow range of ratios of tax haven service imports to total service imports. The
...gure documents a strong correlation between service trade and the allocation of pro...ts with
the ...rm. Speci...cally, ...rms with less than 20% of service imports coming from tax havens
typically allocate below 30% of their foreign pro...ts to tax havens whereas ...rms with 50% or
more of service imports coming from tax havens allocate around 50% of their foreign pro...ts
to tax havens. These results are suggestive that a¢ liate trade in services is a quantitatively
important channel through which ...rm pro...ts are shifted to tax havens.

5.3 Conduit trade
Our analysis may underestimate excess imports from a¢ liates in tax havens if services are fun-
neled through conduit entities in third countries. Firms may use conduit structures to avoid
withholding taxes on royalty payments applying to tax havens but not other countries or to
make service charges look more legitimate by letting the provider be a¢ liates in respectable
non-tax havens. Tax motivated conduit structures to eliminate withholding taxes on dividend
payments have been analyzed empirically (Mintz and Weichenrieder, 2010) and discussed theo-
retically in the context of interest payments (Johannesen, 2012) and hybrid ...nancial instruments
(Johannesen, 2014).
The main challenge associated with the study of conduit structures in service trade is that
while we observe trade 
ows between Germany and any partner country, we do not observe
trade 
ows between other country pairs. Hence, we are constrained to base our inference on the
correlation between trade 
ows in and out of Germany and the location of foreign a¢ liates of
German ...rms. We focus on conduit trade 
ows through the Netherlands, which has anecdotally
been linked to conduit 
ows related to intellectual property (Kleinbard, 2011) and which has
been identi...ed as the main conduit country used by German ...rms for holding purposes by
15
existing academic studies (e.g. Mintz and Weichenrieder, 2010). Speci...cally, we re-estimate
our baseline model while allowing excess imports from a¢ liates in tax havens to di¤er between
...rms that have an a¢ liate in the Netherlands and ...rms that do not. If ...rms funnel service
imports from tax havens through a¢ liates in the Netherlands, we should expect these ...rms
to have less excess imports directly from tax havens. We apply the model to each of the
narrow service categories within Intellectual property and Other business services where we
have consistently found evidence of mispriced trade.
Table 9 reports the results from the baseline speci...cation where the coe¢ cients of interest
are interacted with NL affiliate, which is a dummy variable indicating whether the ...rm has
an entity in the Netherlands. The coe¢ cient on the interaction between Haven and Affiliates
measures excess imports from tax haven a¢ liates for ...rms that are not present in the Nether-
lands. The point estimates are qualitatively similar to the baseline estimates reported in Table
7, but the estimated e¤ects are larger. The coe¢ cient on the triple interaction between Haven,
Affiliate and NL affiliate measures how excess imports from tax haven a¢ liates di¤ers
between ...rms that are and ...rms that are not present in the Netherlands. In seven service cate-
gories, including Patents and Trademarks within Intellectual property and Headquarter services
and Advertising within Other business services, excess imports from tax haven a¢ liates are
signi...cantly smaller when ...rms have an a¢ liate in Netherlands. Interestingly, in most of these
categories, excess imports from tax haven a¢ liates are close to zero for ...rms with a presence in
the Netherlands. In none of the service categories are excess imports from tax haven a¢ liates
larger for ...rms that are present in Netherlands than for those that are not.
Table 9 somewhere around here
5.4 Robustness
Table 10 reports two robustness tests of the model estimated above. First, we estimate the
baseline speci...cation for imports with a logit model. As shown in Panel A, the results are very
similar to the baseline results estimated with a linear probability model (reported in Table 4).
With the logit model, we ...nd excess trade with unrelated parties in tax havens in all service
categories except Construction. Moreover, we ...nd excess trade with a¢ liates in tax havens
in the service categories Information services, Intellectual property, Other business services,
Insurance services and Financial services. The main di¤erences are that excess trade with
a¢ liates in tax havens becomes statistically signi...cant for Insurance services in the logit model
16
whereas it drops to bordeline statistical signi...cance for Sea transport.
Table 10 somewhere around here
Second, we add country ...xed e¤ects to the baseline linear probability model to account for
all country characteristics that a¤ect patterns of service trade. In this speci...cation, the tax
haven dummy as well as the country covariates are unidenti...ed, but we can still estimate the
excess probability of trade with tax haven a¢ liates. As shown in Panel B, the results are again
very similar to the baseline results. The main di¤erence is that excess trade with a¢ liates in
tax havens becomes statistically signi...cant at the 1% level rather than at the 10% level for
Communication services.
6 Conclusion
This paper has used aggregate trade data to show that tax havens play a prominent role in
international trade with service trade and ...rm-level data to explore this role: does it re
ect
genuine specialization in services by tax havens or tax evasion by multinational ...rms? We
showed that ...rm-level patterns in service trade and foreign investment are consistent with both
genuine specialization and pro...t shifting and, further, that entity-level patterns in pro...tability
support the notion that intra-...rm service trade serves to shift pro...ts to tax havens. Finally, we
found evidence suggestive of conduit service trade with tax haven a¢ liates through a¢ liates in
the Netherlands.
While the evidence suggests that service imports from tax haven a¢ liates play a role in
tax evasion, we argued that the implications for government revenue are likely to be modest.
Even under the extreme assumption that all service imports from tax haven a¢ liates are purely
...ctitious transactions where the acquired service has no actual value, the implied revenue loss
would be around e3 billion or, equivalently, around 7% of the total German corporate tax
revenue. Our regression results suggested that excess service imports from haven a¢ liates are
rarely above 100% of normal imports and often much less than that. Taken at face value these
results imply that not more than half of the service imports from tax havens are tax motivated
and, hence, that the government revenue loss is considerably smaller than the upper bound of
e3 billion.
The latter ...nding speaks to contemporary debates about the revenue consequences of inter-
national tax planning by global ...rms. Based on information about the international allocation
of pro...ts within U.S. ...rms, Zucman (2014) sets the annual revenue loss at a staggering $200
17
billion for the U.S. government alone. Hines (2014) use existing estimates of the tax sensitivity
of reported pro...ts to arrive at an upper bound of the revenue loss of around 2-4% of the total
corporate tax revenue, or around $10-20 billion for the U.S. government. While our analysis
only covers one dimension of pro...t shifting, service trade with tax havens, and therefore cannot
hope to bring de...nitive answers to this debate, our ...nding that the revenue losses resulting
from service trade with tax havens are modest do suggest that the consequences of corporate
tax avoidance are perhaps less serious than implied by the most pessimistic estimates.
