Introduction
Aging of population in India is apparent from the trend
depicted over different censuses since 1951. The recent cen-
sus puts up the count of older adults1 to 103,849,040 (Census
of India, 2011). This figure amounts to 8.6% of the popula-
tion of India in 2011. Aging may be viewed from two differ-
ent perspectives, namely, the macro perspective and the
micro perspective. From the macro perspective, it depicts a
distinct population process. As a characteristic of this pro-
cess, the center of the age distribution drifts over the time
toward the higher ages. From a micro perspective, the point
of concern is the older adults and their well-being. Human
beings, during their life course, move into the older adult-
hood after transiting through the childhood, the youth, and
the adulthood. It is quiet plausible that entry into the older
adulthood is accompanied by simultaneous changes in their
economic, social, and health statuses.
While moving into the realm of older adulthood, most of
the people find themselves either retired from active eco-
nomic life or at the verge of retirement. Economically
productive life span of an individual may terminate with her
or his retirement. Besides, working at older ages may not be
at par with working at younger ages in the remunerative
sense. The numbers of working hours also get reduced with
increasing age (Singh, Singh, & Sharma, 1987).
The age of retirement in India, in the formal sector, varies
from 55 to 65 years (Rajan, 2010). However, no such retire-
ment age exists for people working in informal sectors. India,
like other developing countries, has a large agricultural sec-
tor. This sector can absorb and sustain human resources at
older ages. The reason being that unlike the manufacturing
and the service sectors, it does not require skilled workforce.
This sector, therefore, employs a large proportion of

Aging and the Socioeconomic Life of
Older Adults in India: An Empirical
Exposition
Sanjeev Bakshi1 and Prasanta Pathak2
Abstract
The study attempts to approach aging in India from three perspectives, namely, the well-being of an aging individual, the aging
household, and the aging population. The aspects, namely, work, financial dependence, integration, empowerment, and elder
abuse are studied and their relation to age, gender, and marital status is investigated. The data sets pertaining to the National
Sample Surveys for the reference periods 1986-1987, 1995-1996, and 2004 are primarily utilized for the purpose. The data
sets from Building Knowledge Base on Population Ageing in India Survey, 2011, are also utilized for information on elder
abuse. The results show that the older males are more likely to participate in household activities when compared with the
older females. The married older adults are also more likely to participate in household activities when compared with their
widowed counterparts. In a similar way, gender and marital status are found to be associated with empowerment of older
adults. The working older adults, those who possess property and/or assets are more likely to be financially independent.
Furthermore, the older females and the financially dependent older adults are more likely to face abuses of different kinds.
Households are classified into three different types. Type I households have no older adults, Type II households have older
adults and other younger members, and Type III households have older adults only. Results show that Type III households
are found to be relatively more deprived and report higher average monthly expenditure when compared with other types
of households.

economically active older adults. This situation is akin to
what is observed in developing countries in general (Chen,
Jones, & Domingo, 1989; Choe, 1989; Nasir & Ali, 2000;
Perera, 1989). The estimates of the percentage of workers in
informal sectors were 92.2, 92.8, 93.0, and 93.4 during 1987-
1988, 1994-1995, 1999-2000, and 2004-2005, respectively
(Rajan, 2010). This indicates that a large part of the work-
force remains devoid of any post-retirement benefits.
Consequently, these workers turn up being financially depen-
dent at older ages.
Working older adults either work willingly or they are
forced to work for monetary benefits (Dinesh & Rayappa,
1983). The reasons for working during older ages may be
that the economically active older adults are more favorably
treated by their family members (Yadava, Yadava, & Sharma,
1996). Besides, low income households may not be able to
cope with the financial dependency of the older adults (Alam,
2006).
It is presumed that the family was responsible to take care
of the material and non-material needs of the dependent
older adults. This presumption seems logical as we do not
find existence of any other means of support to the depen-
dent older adults, in the past. However, in general, the mate-
rial and the non-material support in a family may flow from
rest of the family to the older adults or there may be a flow of
support from the older adults to the family. Thus, the pro-
vider of support can be conceived as a source of support and
the receiver as a recipient of the support. These kinds of flow
of support are called intergenerational transfers (IGTs). The
direction of IGT can be upward (from children to parents),
downward (from parents to children), or lateral (from sibling
to sibling) and these transfers vary in type as time (including
help, services, and visits), money, and goods (including
shared space and goods through co-residence; Gauthier, Chu,
& Tuljapurkar, 2007). The state of IGT in the Indian sce-
nario, however, requires empirical exposition.
Apart from the changes in the work status, the social role
of an older adult may change. This change occurs because
the younger generation steps into the roles that were once
performed by the older adults. These changes are detrimental
to the autonomy of the older adults. In such situations, ques-
tion naturally arises regarding the capability of the older
adults to make choices regarding the issues that matter in
their lives. This vulnerability cannot be overcome unless the
older adults are powerful enough to have and make choices
regarding such issues. Therefore, the salience of power, and
hence empowerment, is evident at the older ages. In other
words, an older adult either exercises choices or is power-
less. To ensure well-being, the powerless need to be
empowered.
Kar, Catherine, and Kirstin (1999) have identified four
domains or aspects of life that affect the overall quality of
life of the powerless. These are basic human rights, equal
rights for women, economic enhancement, and health pro-
motion and disease prevention. Citing from earlier works
(Freire, 1973; Rappaport, 1987; Wallerstein & Bernstein,
1994; Zimmerman, 1995; Zimmerman, Israel, Schulz, &
Checkoway, 1992), the authors have defined empowerment
as a process through which individuals, communities, and
organizations gain control over issues and problems that con-
cern them the most. According to Kabeer (1999), the process
of empowerment is about making choices. The concept
incorporates three interrelated dimensions namely, agency,2
resources,3 and achievements4 that lead to manifestation of
power5 in the presence of choices.6 Therefore, in the context
of older adults, autonomy in decision making reflects the
power. Another important aspect from the perspective of
well-being of older adults is the integration of older adults
with the household. It shows the acceptability of the older
adults in the household and vice versa in a co-residence type
of living arrangement. Co-residence is the most frequent liv-
ing arrangement among the older adults in India (National
Sample Survey Organization, 1989, 1998). Therefore, an
investigation into integration and its associated aspects may
provide useful insights into this aspect of well-being of older
adults. The issues concerning empowerment and integration
among the older adults in India are yet to be addressed.
During older ages, the risk of a change in the marital sta-
tus, from married to widowed, is very high. Furthermore,
physical mobility is at stake and vulnerabilities to chronic
health conditions are also very common. It is apprehended
that, on account of financial, social, economic, and health
vulnerabilities, the older adults may be susceptible to abuses
of various types.
The preceding sections discuss various aspects of well-
being of the older adults. These aspects may exhibit gender
differentials especially in those social setups where the gen-
der inequality is known to prevail at comparatively younger
ages. The reasons being that the older women in traditional
societies were never a part of the workforce and, therefore,
their continuous financial dependence during the life course
may be detrimental to their well-being at older ages.
Moreover, their social status has association with their mari-
tal status and having a son (Vlassoff, 1990). Although, gen-
der issues pertaining to the non-older adults are well
addressed in recent literature (Bhattacharya, 2006; Devi,
1993; Gulati, 1993; Koenig & Gillian, 1992; Selveratnam,
1988), quantitative studies pertaining to the older adults are
rare.
As distinguished from the macro (population based) and
micro (individual based) perspectives of aging, the third per-
spective concerns the changing composition of the house-
holds. This is a semi-macro perspective that considers aging
from the level of households. Households are residential
units. Within households, the family members live in physi-
cal proximity. A household may not have residing older
adults (say, Type I) or it may have residing older adults. For
the households with residing older adults there may be co-
resident younger people (say, Type II) or there may not be
co-resident younger people (say, Type III). The Type II and
Bakshi and Pathak 3
the Type III kinds of households are, respectively, called the
co-residence and the alone types of living arrangements
(Palloni, 2001).
The co-residence is viewed as one type of the various
types of IGTs (Velkoff, 2000). Aging may alter the distribu-
tion of the household types. It is expected that in an aging
society, the proportion of Type II and Type III combined may
increase over time and the proportion of Type I may decrease
over time. Furthermore, among Type II and Type III house-
holds, the proportion of Type III may increase over time and
Type II may decrease over time. It is also possible that the
proportion of older adults in Type II households may increase
over time. In these ways the aging of households takes place.
From the preceding discussion, it is apparent that work,
financial independence, capacity to make choices, integra-
tion with the household, and health are some of the factors
that are instrumental to the well-being of the older adults. In
addition, the gender and the marital status may be responsi-
ble for the differentials in the well-being. The motivation for
the present work has been on two accounts. First, the exiting
literature on older adults in India lacks an integrated approach
to address different but important aspects of well-being.
Second, studies based on countrywide and time-varying rep-
resentative samples are few. The present study is an attempt
to fill this gap. The specific issues to be investigated are
given as follows:
1. to provide a descriptive account of aging in India
from macro, semi-macro, and micro perspectives;
2. to assess the working and financial dependence of the
older adults and the support from and to the older
adults;
3. to assess the state of power, the state of integration,
and the correlates of elder abuse among the older
adults; and
4. to provide a situational analysis of the Type I, Type
II, and Type III households.
Data and Method
The trends in the proportion of older adults and the old age
dependency ratio (OADR) are utilized for describing the
macro aspects of aging. Let F denote the distribution func-
tion of age in a given population, at a given time. 1 60
- F( )
gives the proportion of older adults in the population. The
OADR is defined as ( ( )) / ( ( ) ( ))
1 60 60 15
- -
F F F . For an
aging population, the values of these indicators form an
increasing sequence over time. Apart from these indicators,
the absolute number of older adults, the average person years
of older males and older females, and the sex ratio have been
utilized to portray the aging in India. For these purposes, data
from decennial censuses from 1961 through 2011 have been
utilized. The following sections describe the concepts and
methods utilized to investigate the micro aspects of aging.
OADR, as a measure of dependency, assumes that all
older adults shall be dependent on adults (people aged
15-59). However, the fact remains that people work even at
older ages. Older adults are working or non-working.
Therefore, the work activity and its variation with age of the
older adults need to be investigated. Older adults may be
financially independent, partially dependent, or completely
dependent. More so, association may exist between the
financial dependence and employment. Considering working
and dependence as ordinal variables, gamma (Agresti, 1990)
has been utilized to investigate the association between the
two. Furthermore, the variation of financial dependence with
age is investigated.
Apart from an earning through an employment, assets,
and property are resources that may contribute to the finan-
cial independence of the older adults. These resources may
have been acquired by an older adult during her or his life-
time prior to the older adulthood. The quantum of assets and
property owned by an older adult may affect her or his finan-
cial dependence at older ages. A multinomial logit regression
model is utilized for investigating the association of financial
dependence with owing assets and owing property. The
model is given as As P E R G Ag
+ + + + + , where As, P, E,
R, G, and Ag denote the factors assets, property, employment
status, place of residence, gender, and age group, respec-
tively. Due to the absence of information on the quantum of
assets/property owned by an older adult, we limit ourselves
to incorporating these variables as binary variables with two
categories having and not having.
As discussed in the preceding sections, employment,
property, and assets are means and resources available with
the older adults to overcome their financial dependence.
However, possessing of assets and/or property may not be
conducive to financial independence of the older adult unless
the older adults have the capacity to manage their owned
asset7 and/or property. Furthermore, this capacity may be
conditioned by the age, gender, and the marital status of an
older adult. The age­power relationship is investigated
through age group­specific proportions of older males and
older females who are managing their owned assets and
owned properties. The gender differentials in power are
depicted through the odds ratios for older males versus older
females. Similarly, the association of marital status and
power is depicted through the odds ratios for currently mar-
ried versus widowed among older males and older females.
The participation of older adults in household matters
indicates involvement and hence integration of the older
adults with household. This can be assessed in case of co-
residence type of living arrangements where the older adults
reside with younger ones. The indicators of integration, as
available in the 42nd and 52nd rounds of the National Sample
Survey (NSS), are participation in the social8 matters, the
religious9 matters, and the daily household chores (DHC).
The associations of the indicators of integration with age,
gender, and marital status have been investigated using mea-
sures similar to that described in the preceding section.
This study takes up the issue of elder abuse by utilizing
the Building Knowledge Base on Population Ageing in India
4 SAGE Open
(BKPAI) survey, 2011. The BKPAI survey classifies elder
abuse into physical abuse10 (PA), verbal abuse11 (VA), eco-
nomic abuse12 (EA), showing disrespect13 (SD), and neglect14
(NE). Logistic regression models given as G A M D
+ + + ,
where G, A, M, and D denote the factors gender, age group,
marital status, and state of financial independence, respec-
tively, are utilized to investigate the association of these fac-
tors with different types of abuses. An effect in a model is
considered significant if the p values corresponding to the
effects are .1 or lesser. The data on elder abuse pertains to the
states of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal, Odisha,
Maharashtra, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu in India. Therefore,
any inferences pertaining to elder abuse may not be general-
ized to the whole of the older adult population of India.
The following section addresses the semi-macro aspect of
aging including the composition of households, the eco-
nomic condition of different type of households, and mea-
sures of the aging for the Type II households.
In the preceding sections, a classification of households
as Type I, Type II, and Type II was introduced. This classifi-
cation is based on the composition of households vis-à-vis
the older adults. The change in composition of household
types is indicated by the change in proportion of their types.
The following two measures are defined to quantify the
aging of the Type II households:
household old age dependency ratio =

.
The geometric mean is used as an average for these
measures. It should be noted that the value of house-
hold old age dependency ratio (HOADR) is 0 for a Type I
household and more than 0 for Type II household. Its
value is undefined for Type III households. Two measures
are used to assess the economic conditions of the different
types of households.
To assess the economic conditions prevailing in different
types of households, the median of household monthly
expenditure per person (MHME) and multidimensional pov-
erty index (MPI) have been utilized. Specifically, the ratio of
MHME for Type I/Type III with respect to MHME for Type
II, for a given reference period, has been utilized. This is to
control for the effect of the inflation over the time.
The MPI has been calculated based on the human devel-
opment reports (United Nations Development Programme
[UNDP],2011). However, the numbers of indicators that are
incorporated to evaluate MPI vary for the reference periods.
This is to incorporate maximum information available on the
indicators of household prosperity during a given reference
period. Thus, for calculating the MPI, two, four, and five
indicators have been used for the reference periods 1986-
1987, 1995-1996, and 2004, respectively (Table 1). For this
purpose, a household is said to be deprived if it is lacking in
any one of the selected indicators under consideration at a
given time period. The study does not attempt to provide any
estimates of the standard errors for the statistics MPI, house-
hold young dependency ratio (HYDR), HOADR, and
MHME. It is assumed that the large sample sizes would pro-
duce estimates for these statistics that are accurate enough
for a general discussion. Nevertheless, bootstrap estimates of
standard errors may be suggested for such arduous statistics.
The computations were carried out on R (R Core Team,
2014).
In addition to the data from census and BKPAI survey, the
present study utilizes data from various rounds of the NSS.
These surveys were conducted during the period July 1986 to
June 1987 (the 42nd round), July 1995 to June 1996 (the
52nd round), and January to June 2004 (the 60th round). The
42nd, 52nd, and the 60th rounds surveyed 32,231, 16,357,
and 13,344 households, respectively, with residing older
adults. Although, the information content of each of the sur-
vey differs in some aspects from the other, similar definitions
are used for all the three surveys.
Results
The number of older adults enumerated in the censuses of
1971 and 2011 were 32,699,731 and 103,849,040, respec-
tively. Corresponding to these census years their proportions
in the population were .06 and .09, respectively (Table 2).
The number as well as the proportion of the older adults
show a monotonically increasing trend over the census years.
Furthermore, a rising OADR, that characterizes an aging
population, is visible in the Indian population. Older females

enjoy a greater average person years when compared with
the older males during all the census years. It was in the
recent censuses of 2001 and 2011 that the sex ratio was
observed to be 1,029 and 1,023, respectively. Preceding the
2011 census, the sex ratio among older adults was in favor of
the older males.
Empirical evidences from the three rounds of NSS indi-
cate that a substantial percentage of older males are
employed. The sample percentages of working older males
are found to be in the range 57.40 to 60.85 in rural areas and
in the range 32.92 to 41.98 in urban areas. However, older
females are mostly engaged in attending domestic duties.
The sample percentage of older females reporting attending
domestic duties ranges from 41.06 to 43.68 in rural areas and
47.30 to 51.65 in urban areas (Tables 3, 4, and 5). However,
the proportion of working older adults falls with increasing
age (Figure 1). Nevertheless, being in workforce has a posi-
tive association with financial independence. This is due to a
positive, high (>.81) and significant value of gamma for all
the reference periods (Table 6). This may be the reason for
the increasing number of financially dependent older adults
at higher ages (Table 7).
The effects of having property on the financial indepen-
dence of older adults, while controlling for employment,
age, gender and place of residence, are found to be posi-
tive. A similar kind of association is observed between
having assets and financial independence. The positivity is
in the sense that the estimated odds, in favor of being
financially independent (when compared with being finan-
cially dependent), are 1.15 times higher for those older
adults who possess assets when compared with those older
adults who do not possess assets. Similarly, the estimated
odds in favor of being financially independent are 2.06
times higher for those older adults who possess property
when compared with those older adults who do not possess
property. For the reference period 1995-1996, the corre-
sponding estimated odds ratios are 2.17 and 2.27, respec-
tively (Table 8). Similarly, the estimated odds in favor of
being partially independent (when compared with being
financially dependent) are 1.28 times higher for those
older adults who possess assets when compared with those
older adults who do not possess assets. Similarly, the esti-
mated odds in favor of being partially independent are 1.52
times higher for those older adults who possess property
when compared with those older adults who do not possess
property. For the reference period 1995-1996 the corre-
sponding estimated odds ratios are 1.61 and 1.62, respec-
tively (Table 9).

The financially independent older adults lend their sup-
port to financially dependent spouse and/or children. During
the three reference periods 1986-1987, 1995-1996, and 2004,
the sample proportion of such supporting older adults among
the financially independent older adults was reported to be
.69, .92, and .86, respectively. However, the financially
dependent older females, if married, are supported by their
spouse or children; and if widow, receive support mainly
from their children. Most of the financially dependent older
males are supported by their children (Figure 2). Similar to
the state of financial independence, the state of power too
shows association with age, gender, and marital status of the
older adults.
Empirical evidences indicate that the proportion of the
older adults who are engaged in managing their owned
properties and assets reduces with an increase in their age
(Figures 3 and 4). It is also evident from the figures that,
when compared with the older males, the older females
engage themselves lesser in these matters. These gender dif-
ferentials also reflect in the odds ratios (Table 10). The

sample odds in favor of managing property are 6.20 times
and 5.22 times higher for older males than that for the older
females during the reference periods 1986-1987 and 1995-
1996, respectively. Similarly, the sample odds in favor of
managing assets are 6.33 times and 5.55 times higher for
older males than that for the older females during the refer-
ence periods, respectively (Table 10). Among the older
adults, being married has an advantage, vis-à-vis power,
over being widow. The odds in favor of managing assets and
properties are higher for the currently married older males
and older females (Table 11). Being able to manage owned
assets and owned property, as a manifestation of power, has
a positive association with financial independence (Table
12). Moreover, the association among older males is found
to be stronger than that among older females.
For a better state of well-being of older adults in a popu-
lation, the participation of the older adults in the social
matters (SM), the religious matters (RM), and the DHC
ought to be total. However, samples from the 42nd and
52nd rounds of NSS indicate that the proportion of older

males and older females who report participation in these
matters decline as one moves from lower age groups to
higher age groups (Figures 5, 6, and 7). Furthermore, the
sample proportions of older females who report participa-
tion are lesser than the sample proportion of older males.
The gender differences in participation are evident as the
odds ratios (older males vs. older females) for both the
time periods are found to be significant and more than 1.
The odds ratios for participation in SM, RM, and DHC are
1.86, 1.63, and 1.50, respectively, for the reference period
1986-1987. The figures for the reference period 1995-1996
are 2.17, 1.73, and 1.16 for the respective indicators of
integration (Table 13).
The married older adults are more likely to get integrated
with their household through participation in SM, RM, and
DHC when compared with widowed older adults. The esti-
mated odds ratios (married vs. widowed) for older males,
during the reference period 1986-1987, are 1.48, 1.98, and

2.12 for SM, RM, and DHC, respectively. During the refer-
ence period 1995-1996 the estimated odds ratio are 1.85,
1.82, and 2.04 for SM, RM, and DHC, respectively. Similarly,
for older females the figures are 1.11, 1.16, and 1.61 for SM,
RM, and DHC, respectively, during the reference period
1985-1986 and 2.27, 2.58, and 2.94 during the reference
period 1995-1996 (Table 14). The findings on the elder abuse
are described in the following section.
Gender is found to be associated with VA, EA, and NE.
Older females are 2.03 times more likely to face VA when
compared with older males (Table 15). Older females are
more prone to EA and NE as they are 1.67 times and 2.17
times more likely to face EA and NE, respectively, when
compared with older males. Financially dependent older
adults are 1.81 times more likely than the financially inde-
pendent older adults to face PA. Widow older adults are 0.61
times less likely to face EA when compared with their mar-
ried counterparts. SD is less likely to happen with increasing
age as the odds in favor of SD reduce by 0.98 times with a
unit increase in age of older adults. Furthermore, the model
for any type of abuse indicates that older females are 1.25
times more likely than older males to face abuse. Older
adults who are financially dependent and partially dependent
are 1.96 and 1.26 times more likely than their financially
independent counterparts to face abuse. The following
sections provide a situational analysis of the three types of
households defined earlier.
The estimates of the proportion of Type I, Type II, and
Type III households show an increase in the proportion of
Type II and Type III combined (Table 16). This increase is
experienced in rural as well as urban areas. In other words,
there is an increase in households with older adults over the
decade 1995-1996 to 2004. Furthermore, among the house-
holds with older adults, the ratio of co-residence to alone
type of households has decreased in urban areas from 11.50
in 1986-1987 to 8.09 in 2004 (Table 17). In rural areas too
this ratio decreased from 8.09 in 1986-1987 to 7.33 in 2004.
The statistics regarding HOADR and HYDR for Type II
households (Table 18) indicate that there is a rise in mean
HOADR in rural and urban areas over the time. During the
same period, it is observed that the average HYDR has
declined over the time. This holds for both the rural and the
urban areas. Values of the average HOADR and the average
HYDR are found to be higher in rural areas when compared
with those in the urban areas for all reference periods.
The values for the ratio of MHME for Type I/Type III
with respect to MHME for Type II, for the three reference
periods are described in Table 19. The alone type of house-
holds have a higher MHME when compared with the co-
residence type of households for all the given reference

periods and for rural and urban places of residence. The
households without older adults when compared with the co-
residence type of households do not differ with respect to the
MHME but they are found to be more deprived than the co-
residence type of households. Let us now consider the eco-
nomic condition of the three types of households in terms of
deprivation with respect to selected indicators. Keeping in
view that the MPIs are not comparable across time periods,
some salient observations (Table 20) regarding the three
types of households are presented. Older adults having alone
type of living arrangements are more deprived than people
residing in co-residence type of households. This holds for
rural as well as urban areas for all the time periods consid-
ered. People residing in Type I households are more deprived
than people living in co-residence type of households.
However, they are less deprived when compared with older
adults having alone type of living arrangements.
Discussion
The foregoing analyses provide a three-tier description of
aging in India. The three tiers of aging are the aging indi-
vidual, the aging household, and the aging population. The
utility of a three-tier approach to aging is that it may help
formulating a three pronged policy to address various types
of challenges imposed by aging. The policies need to simul-
taneously address the older adults, the families that have
older adults as their members, and the population.
This study is primarily based on three countrywide repre-
sentative data sets of the NSS. The periods, pertaining to
these sample surveys, span more than 18 years from 1986 to
2004. However, throughout this period similar patterns are
observed regarding the work, the integration, and the empow-
erment among the older adults.
A change in work status, a change in marital status, and
susceptibility to chronic conditions are quiet possible for an
individual at older ages (Figure 8). The findings indicate
that the life of an older adult is not immune to such changes.
The married older adults are found to be more participating

in their household matters. They are also more likely to be
decision makers than their widow counterparts. Gender dif-
ferential prevails in the matters pertaining to exercising
power in financial matters and participation in household
affairs. The older males are in relatively better position
(Figure 8). Rajan (2010) has opined that the disadvantaged
status of older females vis-à-vis the ownership of financial
assets/property is due to limited implementation of inheri-
tance laws. These differentials may be attributed to the
social construct of the Indian society. The family and the
society need to be educated on these issues so that these dif-
ferentials cease to exist.
There is also a need to sensitize public to uphold the dig-
nity of the older adults. This is so because different types of
abuses are reported by the older adults. Older women and
financially dependent older adults are more likely to face
abuses. It is recently that such information is being made
available in large-scale surveys in India. Nevertheless, the
NSSs need to incorporate this crucial information in their
surveys on the older adults. It is also desired that country-
wide information on social and economic aspects of the older
adults be made available more frequently and in greater
detail through the NSSs. This is because the rounds of the
NSS for the years 1986-1987, 1995-1996, 2003-2004, and

2013-2014, which included surveys on the older adults, have
a greater focus on health-related issues among older adults.
Although a sound health is an important determinant of the
well-being of the older adults, the present study limits itself
to the socioeconomic aspects of their well-being.
Financial independence is desirable among older adults.
Employment, property, and assets enhance it (Figure 8).
However, work participation and remunerative job opportu-
nities decline with age. Therefore, the need for financial sup-
port is greater among those older adults who are at the higher
end of the age spectrum. If fact, the older females need it the
most. Although, various old age pensions schemes are in
effect, in Indian states, the adequacy of the pension amount
in ensuring financial independence needs to be periodically
assessed. The pensions need to be enhanced with increasing
age of the older adults. Meeting the financial needs through
a judicious combination of public and familial transfers may
provide a viable solution.
Alone kind of living arrangements is found to be increas-
ing among the older adults. Furthermore, the share of younger
ones is declining in the co-residence type of living arrange-
ments. According to Velkoff (2000), these changes are
responses to the trends in fertility, mortality, and migration
that impact on family size and household structure. The
adults in a household are potential care providers to the older
adults. However, if this trend persists, an alternative structure
for providing care to the older adults may be required. In
other words, care needs to be available at the doorsteps of the
older adults.
Another crucial aspect is the relatively deprived condition
of the older adults in the alone type of living arrangements. It
may be possible that their higher expenditure may be respon-
sible for this deprivation. The higher expenditures observed
among the households with alone type of living arrange-
ments may be due to the costs incurred in maintaining sound
health at older ages. Potential of alternative systems of health
care and medicine, that are cost effective, may lessen the
financial burden of ill health at the older ages. Focused in-
depth studies are called for to understand and address the
reasons for relative deprivation in alone kind of living

arrangements. Unlike the older adults living alone, the co-
residents have a relatively lesser deprived life. The reason
may be that the resources get shared in a co-residence type of
living arrangement. This also results in a lower cost of living.
A policy on living arrangements is desired that promotes co-
residence on one hand and a housing policy for older adults
who opt for alone type of living arrangements on the other.
The signs of aging are evident in the population of India.
To put it in simple terms, the proportion and number of peo-
ple in higher age groups is gradually increasing. In this per-
spective, a policy on population is called for so that the social
system may be able to manage aging. The bottom line
remains that no society can afford aging of its population to
continue so as to reach an unmanageable extent. More so, the
population policies that address the macro perspectives and
welfare policies for older adults are individual centric.
Involvement of the family, through an integrated family-cen-
tric policy, may better ensure the well-being of the older
adults.

Notes
 1. In India, the demarcation line to separate the older adults from
the rest of the population, for formulating and implementing
welfare schemes, ranges from 55 years to 74 years (Rajan,
2007). For the present study, an older adult is defined to be a
person aged 60 years and above.
2. Agency/Process: The ability to define one's goals and act
upon them. Agency is more than about observable action; it
also encompasses the meaning, motivation, and purpose that
individuals bring to their activity, their sense of agency, or "the
power within."
3. Resources/Pre-conditions: Resources include not only mate-
rial resources in the more conventional economic sense but
also various human and social resources, which serve to
enhance the ability to exercise choice.
 4. Achievements are outcomes.
 5. Power: The ability to make choices.
 6. Choices: Choice necessarily implies the possibility of alterna-
tives, the ability to have chosen otherwise.
 7. The participation in management of financial assets is defined
as involvement in making decisions such as making or enchas-
ing fixed deposits and so on in bank or post office, purchase, or
encashment of National Saving Certificates (N.S.Cs.)/bonds/
shares, and generally deciding the change in portfolio of finan-
cial assets held by the household and conversion of one form
of assets into another (National Sample Survey Organization,
1989, 1998).
 8. The participation in social matters means physical or mental
(giving advice) participation in arranging important functions
such as marriage, shraadh ceremony (post cremation ceremo-
nies), and so on (National Sample Survey Organization, 1989,
1998).
 9. The participation in religious matters means physical or men-
tal (giving advice) participation in arranging religious func-
tions (National Sample Survey Organization, 1989, 1998).
10. Physical abuse: It includes beating, kicking, slapping, stab-
bing, shooting, pushing, biting, pinching, strangling, and so
on.
11. Verbal abuse (VA): It is a form of abusive behavior involving
the use of language. It is a form of vulgarity that can occur
with or without the use of expletive. It can be either through
oral communication, which is the most common form of VA,
or abusive words in written form.
12. Economic abuse: This is a common abuse elderly face in many
countries. The illegal or improper use of an elder's funds, prop-
erty, or assets will come under this abuse. Examples include,
but are not limited to, cashing an elderly person's checks
without authorization or permission, forging an older person's
signature in checks or documents and misusing or stealing an
older person's money or possessions, coercing or deceiving
an older person into signing any document (e.g., contracts or
will), and so on, will come under this category.
13. Showing disrespect: It is expected to show proper respect to
elders particularly in our culture. Any act or behavior showing
lack of respect to elder will come under this category.
14. Neglect: The failure for a caregiver to meet the needs of a
dependent elderly person, which may be intentional such as
withholding of food, medications, failure to clean or bathe, and
so on, come under this category.
