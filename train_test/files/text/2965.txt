Background: Variations in the relationships among in-
come, use of mental health services, and sector of care
are examined by comparing data from 3 countries that
differ in the organization and financing of mental health
services.
Methods: Data come from the 1990-1992 National Co-
morbidity Survey (n = 5384), the 1990-1991 Mental
Health Supplement to the Ontario Health Survey
(n = 6321), and the 1996 Netherlands Mental Health Sur-
vey and Incidence Study (n = 6031). Analysis of the as-
sociation between income and use of mental health ser-
vices was carried out for the population that was between
ages 18 and 54 years. Differential use of mental health
treatment was examined in 3 sectors: the general medi-
cal sector, the specialty sector, and the human services
sector.
Results: No significant association between income and
probability of any mental health treatment was ob-
served for persons with psychiatric disorders in any of
the 3 countries. However, there were significant differ-
ences among countries in the association between in-
come and sector of mental health care treatment. In the
United States, income is positively related to treatment
being received in the specialty sector and negatively re-
lated to treatment being received in the human services
sector. In the Netherlands, patients in the middle-
income bracket are less likely to receive specialty care,
while those in the high-income bracket are less likely to
be seen in the human service sector. Income is unre-
lated to the sector of care for patients in Ontario.
Conclusions: Future research should examine whether
differential access to the specialty sector for low-income
people in the United States is associated with worse men-
tal health outcomes.

IMPROVING EQUITY in mental
health care within a country--
guaranteeing that those in need
receive services independently of
the person's ability to pay1--is in-
creasingly relevant as national policies seek
to modify disease outcomes.2 However,
there is considerable cross-national
variation in how the organization and
financing of mental health services are
designed to provide equity in access and
quality of treatment. Some countries,
such as Turkey, have failed to develop a
special health care program for the
poor,3 while others, such as the United
States, have developed separate health
care programs for those unable to pay.4
Still other countries, such as Canada,
have established universal health insur-
ance plans explicitly designed to provide
equality in the opportunity for treatment
regardless of ability to pay.5
The US system has been criticized for
being inherently inequitable.6,7 People in
different income strata are seen as segre-
gated into separate sectors believed to dif-
fer in type and quality of care.6,7 Consis-
tent with this criticism, research has shown
that low-income people in the United
States have comparatively low rates of
treatment for mental disorders8,9 and are
less likely than their economically advan-
taged counterparts to be treated by men-
tal health specialists.10,11 These findings are
especially disturbing given that need for
treatment is higher among low-income
people than in the rest of the popula-
tion,12,13 and that those with reported men-
tal disorders seem to experience signifi-
cant barriers to the receipt of needed
medical care.14
The United States, Canada, and the
Netherlands vary in how their health care
systems are organized and financed to pro-
vide equitable access in health and men-
tal health services. In the United States, ap-
proximately 60% of the population was
covered by private insurance during the

early 1990s.15 Insurance coverage differed widely16 and
tended to be associated with income, making the effects
of income difficult to disentangle from those of cover-
age. The poor received mental health care either through
state public mental health programs in community clin-
ics or through independent specialty providers paid
through Medicaid coverage.17
Ontario18 has universal health insurance coverage
available to residents through a government-sponsored
single-payer system explicitly designed to equalize ac-
cess to treatment. Mental health services are provided by
physicians19 (such as family physicians20) reimbursed by
government in a fee-for-service modality or by psycholo-
gists and social workers employed by government-
funded mental health centers.21 The system places no lim-
its on inpatient stays or outpatient visits for mental health
care, but does apply supply-side controls to limit use.22
Despite Canada's universal access system, recent evalu-
ations suggest problems of access22,23 and greater use of
specialist services for medical care among high-income
vs other groups.24
In the Netherlands,25 every person subject to Dutch
income taxation is covered by the Exceptional Medical
Expenses Act, funded by a compulsory premium; ben-
efits include comprehensive psychiatric care. The Social
Health Insurance Act, a statutory insurance for employ-
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA
The data come from the 1990-1992 National Comorbidity
Survey (NCS) (n = 5384),13 the 1990-1991 Mental Health
Supplement to the Ontario Health Survey (the Supple-
ment) (n = 6321),28,29 and the 1996 Netherlands Mental
Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS)
(n = 6031).30,31 Each of these surveys carried out face-to-
face interviews with a probability sample of the general
population and obtained parallel information on the life-
time and recent prevalence of DSM-III-R disorders and use
of mental health services. The focus of this report is on dis-
orders and outpatient treatment during the 12 months pre-
vious to the interview.
The sample for each of the 3 surveys was based on a
multistage area-probability design in which a single re-
spondent was selected for interview in each sampled house-
hold. Weights were imposed on the data to adjust for dif-
ferential probabilities of selection and, in the NCS, for
differential response. Although rates of psychiatric mor-
bidity in the NCS were higher among nonresponders, the
overall morbidity rates were not substantially affected by
the adjustment for nonresponse. Response rates were 82.4%
in the NCS, 67.4% in the Supplement, and 69.7% in
NEMESIS. Given that the age ranges of the samples dif-
fered, all the analyses reported herein are limited to re-
spondents in the age range of 18 to 54 years.
DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT
Diagnoses are based on the Composite International Di-
agnostic Interview (CIDI),32 a fully structured research di-
agnostic interview designed for use by trained interview-
ers who do not have clinical experience. Twelve CIDI
disorders were considered: mood disorders (major depres-
sion, dysthymia, and mania); anxiety disorders (general-
ized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, simple phobia, so-
cial phobia, and agoraphobia); and substance use disorders
(abuse of or dependence on either alcohol or drugs). The
World Health Organization CIDI Field Trials33 and an NCS
clinical reappraisal study34 documented good reliability and
validity for all of these diagnoses other than mania.35
USE OF OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES
All respondents, independent of symptoms, were asked
whether they had ever seen a professional for problems with
their mental health. Positive responses were followed by in-
quiries on the recency of treatment (use of outpatient ser-
vices in the last year) and the types of professionals seen. The
NCSand theSupplementassessedserviceusebyasking,"Did
you ever in your lifetime go to see any of the professionals in
this list [the lists were identical except that the NCS added
programs provided in jails, prisons, and drop-in centers as
options] for problems with your emotions, nerves, or your
use of alcohol or drugs?" The NEMESIS asked, "I will list a
number of persons or agencies where people can go for help.
Did you ever in your lifetime go to see [providers were as-
sessed by separate yes/no questions] for psychological prob-
lems or alcohol or drug-related problems of your own?" The
wording of questions varied, but was sufficiently similar to
allow parallel coding of information as to whether treat-
ment was obtained in each of 3 service sectors: general medi-
cal, specialty, and human services. The main differences be-
tween the lists were that NEMESIS excluded cardiologists,
gynecologists, and other physicians and instead asked about
company physicians, added crisis centers as another option,
and combined psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychothera-
pists under 1 question.
Any mental health treatment was defined as 1 or more
visits to a professional for a mental health problem. Gen-
eral medical sector was defined as mental health treatment
by a medical physician other than a psychiatrist, regard-
less of setting, or as treatment by an ancillary health pro-
fessional (eg, nurse), excluding social worker and coun-
selor, in any non­mental health setting. Specialty sector was
defined as mental health treatment by a psychiatrist, psy-
chologist, or psychotherapist, or as treatment by any pro-
fessional in a specialty mental health setting (eg, psychi-
atric outpatient clinic). Human services sector was defined
as mental health treatment received in a social or welfare
service agency or by a social worker or counselor in any
setting other than a specialty setting.
INCOME
Total family income was assessed by parallel questions in
the 3 surveys. The NCS asked, "Please tell me which [of a
series of categories presented on a card] represents your
total household income before taxes last year, including sala-
ries, wages, social security, welfare, and any other in-
come?" The Supplement asked, "What is your best esti-
mate of your household income from all sources in 1990
before income tax deductions?" The NEMESIS phrased the
question as, "We would like to compare the results of this
survey with the incomes of the Dutch population. That is

ees earning less than $40 000 per year, covers normal
medical expenses not included by the Exceptional
Medical Expenses Act. In the Netherlands, for the 35%
of the people who are not covered either by the Social
Health Insurance Act or by specific plans for public
employees, private health insurance is an available
option. Patients getting outpatient mental health pay a
fixed fee per visit. Thus, a fee-for-service structure for
the higher-income population and a capitated system
for the lower-income population coexist.23 Social and
psychiatric services are stratified so that specialty men-
tal health care usually requires referrals from general
practitioners, who retain an integral role in the mental
health care of the patient.26 The Netherlands also has a
broad concept of mental health that encompasses psy-
chosocial problems,27 and additional policies regarding
health promotion and disease prevention, such as out-
reach programs.26
The purpose of the current report is to present com-
parative results on the relationship between income and
mental health treatment in 3 countries that have fairly
different systems of organization and financing of health
care: the United States, the Netherlands, and the prov-
ince of Ontario, Canada. This report takes advantage of
the general-population epidemiological surveys con-
ducted in these 3 sites, using parallel sample designs and
why it is important for us to have information about the
total income of your household per month [transformed
to annual household income]. Can you indicate which cat-
egory corresponds with the total income per month of your
household?"
Careful consideration was given to select the most ap-
propriate way to define income groups for purposes of com-
parison. Simply translating the 3 currencies into a common
currency (such as dollars) on the basis of exchange rates does
not take into account the variable purchasing power of a dol-
lar in each site. A comparison of percentages ignores the fact
that the lowest 10% in one site may be richer than the low-
est 10% in another site. A comparison of the standardized
income distributions has the undesirable effect of assuming
that the means and variances of all sites are equal. Sensitiv-
ity analyses were performed with several income defini-
tions. Given that our primary purpose was to identify people
in other countries who were comparable with people in the
4 quartiles in the United States, we established the quartiles
based on the US income distribution. We also investigated
the effect of income across service use by defining income
groupsbasedonthequartilesofincomeineachcountrysepa-
rately, guaranteeing 25% of the population in each group in
each country. The results were uniformly in the direction
of diluting the differences between sites by income. We be-
lieve this is because the lowest income quartile in Ontario
or the Netherlands contains many "nonpoor" and the high-
est quartile many "nonrich" in these countries with more
egalitarian distributions of income. This set of results led us
to use absolute rather than relative income as the method
for comparing Ontario and the Netherlands with the United
States.
Total family income was therefore coded in 4 catego-
ries based on the income distribution in the United States.
For the United States, these categories were formed from
the quartile distribution points ($18 750, $18 751-
30 000, $30 001-60 000, $60 001). For Ontario and the
Netherlands, income was converted to US dollars and 4 cat-
egories were created using the same income cutpoints as
in the United States. While this constrains the distribu-
tion of income across categories in the United States, it places
no constraints on the distribution in Ontario and the Neth-
erlands.
SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND PSYCHIATRIC
MORBIDITY VARIABLES
Three sociodemographic control variables available across
data sets and found to be associated with mental health
service use36,37 were considered: age, sex, and marital sta-
tus. Age was coded categorically in the ranges 18 to 24, 25
to 34, 35 to 44, and 45 to 54 years. Sex was coded dichoto-
mously (male or female). Marital status was coded cat-
egorically as married, never married, and previously mar-
ried (ie, separated, divorced, or widowed). Given the
differences in health care structures, insurance data were
not comparable across sites.
Differences in psychiatric morbidity and severity of
illness by country may account for differences in the
response of utilization patterns to income. Therefore,
psychiatric morbidity was operationalized as the pres-
ence or absence of any of the assessed psychiatric disor-
ders and as the recency of such disorders, ranging from
no long-term disorder to 2 or more disorders lasting at
least 12 months.
ANALYSIS PROCEDURES
Site-specific cross-tabulations were computed to study
psychiatric disorders and treatment use and the gross
associations between income and treatment. Logistic
regression analysis was then used to adjust for age, sex,
marital status, and psychiatric morbidity in estimating the
net associations between income and treatment. Differen-
tial willingness to report income across surveys (refusal
rate was 8.0% in the NCS, 15.4% in the Supplement, and
4.7% in NEMESIS) was controlled by adding a dummy
variable to distinguish respondents who refused to report
their income from other respondents. Regression-based
imputation38 was used to assign income values to NCS
respondents with missing scores. Missing values were not
imputed in the other 2 surveys. Imputing values for miss-
ing data influences only the SEs and does not introduce
bias into the point estimates. Pooled analyses with inter-
action terms were used to test the significance of between-
site differences in the associations of income with treat-
ment.
The SEs of prevalence estimates and of logistic
regression coefficients were computed using the method
of jackknife repeated replications to adjust for the design
effects introduced by clustering and weighting of observa-
tions.39 The significance of differences between pairs of
coefficients was evaluated with z tests based on these cor-
rected SEs. The significance of differences among larger
sets of coefficients was evaluated with Wald 2 tests based
on jackknife repeated replication coefficient variance-
covariance matrices. All evaluations of significance are
based on 2-sided tests with P.05.

instruments. Drawing from this comparative analysis of
mental health care use across 3 countries may lead us to
observations of how national policies may achieve eq-
uity in mental health care use.
The present study addresses 2 questions: (1) Are
there site differences in the probability of receiving any
outpatient mental health treatment by income among
people with mental disorders assessed in these surveys?
We expected that in the United States (before managed
care) mental health service use would be higher by per-
sons at the extreme ends of the income distribution, equal
for the poor and nonpoor in Ontario, and lower for the
wealthy in the Netherlands. (2) Are there cross-national
differences in the association between income and sec-
tor in which treatment is received? Several differences
were expected. In the United States, we expected pro-
portional use of the specialty sector to be lower among
low-income people. In Ontario, sector of care was not
expected to vary by income strata. The Netherlands was
expected to have a higher use of the general health sec-
tor for all income groups except for the high-income
group.
RESULTS
DISTRIBUTIONS OF DISORDERS
AND TREATMENT
As shown in Table 1, there were significant between-
site differences in the 12-month prevalence of having at
least 1 psychiatric disorder assessed (29.1% in the United
States, 24.4% in the Netherlands, and 19.9% in Ontario).
There were also significant differences across sites in the
estimated probabilities of any 12-month mental health
treatment (referred to as any treatment in this article), as
shown in the table. The estimated probabilities of receiv-
ing any treatment were higher in the Netherlands (31.7%
among respondents with a disorder and 7.6% among those
with no disorder) than in the United States (22.3% and
6.3%, respectively) or Ontario (21.8% and 3.4%,
respectively).
The remainder of Table 1 shows data on the pro-
portional distribution of any treatment in the general
medical, specialty, and human services sectors. A signifi-
cantly higher proportion of patients was treated in the
general medical sector in the Netherlands (78.8% of all
mental health service users with 1 or more disorders and
67.7% of those without a disorder) and in Ontario
(65.9% and 64.6%, respectively) than in the United
States (35.6% and 31.4%, respectively). There were no
significant between-site differences in the proportional
use of specialty sector services, either in the subsample
with a disorder (52.5%-55.3% across sites) or in the sub-
sample with no disorder (42.3%-46.8% across sites).
Proportional use of the human services sector was sig-
nificantly higher in the United States (38.5% of all ser-
vice users with 1 or more disorders and 40.9% of those
without a disorder) than in either Ontario (15.3% and
16.0%, respectively) or the Netherlands (18.6% and
14.9%, respectively).

Twelve-month outpatient psychiatric treatment was defined as any treatment by a physician, a mental health professional, another health care professional,
a religious or spiritual advisor, or a human services professional for problems with emotions, mental health, or substance use.
Percentages add up to greater than 100 because some patients were treated in more than 1 service sector.

site difference in these distributions, largely because of
the higher proportion of US respondents with incomes
in the lowest category (24.2%, compared with 6.9% in
Ontario and 10.7% in the Netherlands).
The results in Table 2 document a consistent and
significant inverse relationship in each of the surveys
between income and the prevalence of having at least 1
psychiatric disorder. The odds ratios (ORs) comparing
disorder prevalence in the lowest vs highest income cat-
egories vary only modestly across sites, from 2.2 in the
Netherlands to 1.5 in Ontario. Results also show that
there was no significant association between income
and receiving any outpatient psychiatric treatment in
any of the sites when differences in demographics and
psychiatric morbidity were controlled.
Findings in Table 3 examine the between-site
differences in more detail by distinguishing sub-
samples of respondents who did not meet criteria for
any of the disorders compared with those who did
meet criteria for any of these disorders in each
site. Results in the United States show marginally sig-
nificant elevated relative odds of treatment among
respondents with no disorder in the highest income
category. There was no significant income-treatment
association in either subsample (no disorder or any
disorder) in Ontario. In the Netherlands, a negative
and significant association between income and any
treatment was observed among those with no disorder.
However, there was no significant income-treatment
association in the subsample with any psychiatric dis-
order for any of the sites. There was a significant
between-site difference in the association between
income and any treatment for respondents with no
disorder.

§Income categories were calculated using the National Comorbidity Survey distribution, in which respondents are categorized into 4 quartiles. Both Ontario and
the Netherlands are classified using the National Comorbidity Survey quartile cutpoints. Thus, the 0-25 category represents those in the United States, Ontario,
and the Netherlands with incomes of 0 to $18 750, the 26-50 category represents those with incomes of $18 751 to $30 000, the 51-75 category represents those
with incomes of $30 001 to $60 000, and 76 category represents those with incomes greater than $60 000.

INCOME DIFFERENCES IN SECTOR OF
TREATMENT
Associations between income and the proportional dis-
tribution of treatment across service sectors are pre-
sented in Table 4. As shown, the between-site differ-
ence in the association between income and proportional
use of the general medical sector was not significant. How-
ever, there was a significant inverse association in On-
tario, a significant U-shaped association in the Nether-
lands, and no meaningful association in the United States.
Subsample analyses (results not shown) found that these
associations existed both among respondents who met
criteria for any psychiatric disorder and among those who
did not meet criteria for any of these disorders.
There was a significant between-site difference in
the association between income and proportional use of
the specialty sector because of a significant positive as-
sociation in the United States, a significant U-shaped as-
sociation in the Netherlands, and no meaningful asso-
ciation in Ontario. Subsample analyses (results not shown)
found that these between-site differences hold up in sub-
samples defined by the presence or absence of the DSM-IV
disorders assessed in the surveys.
Finally, there was no significant between-site dif-
ference in the association between income and propor-
tional use of the human services sector. A significant in-
verse association was present in both the United States
and the Netherlands but not in Ontario. Subsample analy-
ses (results not shown) found that these between-site dif-
ferences hold up for those assessed with DSM-III-R dis-
orders and for those who did not meet criteria for any of
these disorders.
COMMENT
The results reported are limited by several methodo-
logic considerations. These include differences in the 3
survey conditions, the lack of refined measures to estab-
lish receipt of mental health treatment rather than men-
tal health visits, and the study's inability to account for
heterogeneity across the sites in attitudinal values re-
lated to mental health care. Therefore, some unknown
part of the difference in the results may have been be-

cause of differences in the types of instruments, training
procedures, or field quality control used in the 3 sur-
veys. Furthermore, the CIDI's lack of measurements of
syndrome severity, distress, or impairment could ex-
plain some of the between-site differences in rates of treat-
ment. Research has shown that these dimensions are more
important than dichotomous diagnostic classifications in
determining help-seeking behaviors.40-43 Finally, while we
used income as a proxy for economic access, it may be a
proxy for other factors, such as differential perceived need
for treatment,44 differential readiness to use treatment,45
and differential attitudes about physicians.36
Within the context of these limitations, however,
many of the results are in agreement with previous stud-
ies and highlight the remarkable pattern of consistency
across sites. The findings document that 1 of every 4 or
5 people in the general population met criteria for a psy-
chiatric disorder during a year,13,31,46-48 that low-income
people had a higher prevalence of mental disorders than
others in the population,12,13,49 and that only a minority
of people with mental disorders obtained treatment within
a given year.42,46,50
Several noteworthy between-site differences were
also documented. The first is a difference in the rates of
obtaining treatment; the rates were similar in the United
States and Ontario but much higher in the Netherlands.
Since the systems of Ontario and the Netherlands are
more similar, differences in the financing of health ser-
vices cannot fully account for this finding. Some alter-
nate explanations include the Netherlands' unique tradi-
tion of primary-care outreach and screening for mental
health problems,26 or their differential knowledge of,
positive attitudes toward, and reduced stigma associated
with mental health care.37

General medical sector was defined as treatment by a medical physician other than a psychiatrist regardless of setting or by an ancillary health professional
(eg, nurse), excluding social workers and counselors, in any setting other than a specialty mental health setting. Specialty sector was defined as treatment
by either a psychiatrist or a psychologist regardless of setting or treatment by any other type of nonphysician professional in a specialty mental health setting
(eg, hospital psychiatric emergency or psychiatric outpatient clinic). Human services sector was defined as treatment by a social worker or counselor in any
setting other than a specialty mental health setting.

The distribution of patients across the service sec-
tors also differed by site and led to important insights into
the sites' differences in mental health care organization.
The dramatically higher proportion of patients treated
by the general medical sector in Ontario (two thirds) and
the Netherlands (three fourths) compared with the United
States (one third) confirms that the primary care physi-
cian served a stronger gatekeeper function in the former
2 sites. Furthermore, the significantly lower proportion
of patients seen in the human services sector in the Neth-
erlands and Ontario suggests that family physicians in
Canada20 and general practitioners in the Netherlands26
may more commonly undertake these social and psychi-
atric services. Given the greater percentage of people in
poverty in the United States, there might be a greater need
than in the other sites to structure a more defined hu-
man services sector.
Within the individual sites, no significant associa-
tion was found between income and probability of ob-
taining any treatment, suggesting that, contrary to the
proposed hypothesis, each system provides some type of
mental health care to its citizens, regardless of their abil-
ity to pay. Because many of these services are offered out-
side the specialty sector, however, such findings may not
hold true under more strict criteria regarding receipt of
mental health treatment.
In contrast, specification analyses across sites re-
vealed an association between income and treatment in
the data from respondents who did not meet criteria for
any of the assessed disorders. Their responses showed
both a positive income-treatment trend in the United
States and a negative trend in the Netherlands. Indeed,
when care is discretionary, attitudinal and propensitychar-
acteristics of the person may interact with the organiza-
tion and financing of the services to increase or reduce
the likelihood of seeking mental health treatment. One
plausible interpretation is that, in contrast to Ontario, bar-
riers to treatment among people with low need for ser-
vices in the United States may be primarily financial. The
decreased access to treatment among high-income re-
spondents with low need in the Netherlands probably re-
flects the fact that Social Health Insurance is not avail-
able to Dutch residents in the top third of the income
distribution and disposable income might not be com-
parable with that in the United States.
In addition, a significant between-site difference was
also found for income and specialty care. High-income
US patients are significantly more likely to obtain spe-
cialty sector treatment, while low-income patients are sig-
nificantly more likely to receive treatment in the human
services sector. These results reflect financial barriers to
specialty care for the poor in the United States, barriers
nonexistent within the universal insurance system in On-
tario. These findings raise concerns about the quality and
content of care received by low-income patients, a criti-
cism of the US system. Although more research is needed
to support these claims, available evidence is consistent
with this possibility.6,7,10,11,51,52 Data show that the pro-
portions of depressed patients in the United States and
Ontario who receive adequate medication treatment are
much higher among those treated by psychiatrists than
among those treated by primary care physicians.44 Our
findings suggest that social class may limit the type of
care patients receive in specialties other than mental health
care. Future research on differential access clearly needs
to address the question of whether separate is equitable
in the provision of mental health services to people who
differ in economic resources.
