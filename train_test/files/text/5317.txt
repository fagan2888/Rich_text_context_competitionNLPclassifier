Abstract. Saccadic eye-movements to a visual target are less accurate if there are distracters close
to its location (local distracters). The addition of more distracters, remote from the target location
(remote distracters), invokes an involuntary increase in the response latency of the saccade and
attenuates the effect of local distracters on accuracy. This may be due to the target and distracters
directly competing (direct route) or to the remote distracters acting to impair the ability to disengage
from fixation (indirect route). To distinguish between these, we examined the development of saccade
competition by recording saccade latency and accuracy responses made to a target and local
distracter compared with those made with an addition of a remote distracter. The direct route would
predict that the remote distracter impacts on the developing competition between target and local
distracter, while the indirect route would predict no change as the accuracy benefit here derives from
accessing the same competitive process but at a later stage. We found that the presence of the
remote distracter did not change the pattern of accuracy improvement. This suggests that the remote
distracter was acting along an indirect route that inhibits disengagement from fixation, slows saccade
initiation, and enables more accurate saccades to be made.

1 Introduction
Owing to natural limitations of the visual system we must move our eyes to facilitate
gathering visual information about our environment (Findlay and Gilchrist 2003; Land
and Tatler 2009). The selection of the next target for our saccadic eye movements is the
outcome of a competition between different potential visual targets (Allport 1993; Desimone
and Duncan 1995; McPeek 2006; McPeek et al 2003; Munoz and Istvan 1998; Schall and
Thompson 1999). The development of this competition can be shown through a modulation
of saccade response time and landing position when other, distracting, stimuli must be
inhibited: changes in when and where the eyes are directed reveals the state of the underlying
neural competition at the time of saccade initiation (Findlay 1982; Findlay and Walker
1999; Glimcher and Sparks 1993; Ludwig and Gilchrist 2003; McPeek 2006; McPeek et al
2003; McSorley and Findlay 2003; McSorley et al 2006; van Opstal and van Gisbergen 1989).
Saccades with shorter latencies are less accurate than those with longer latencies. This can
be seen within the natural variations in latencies over the course of an experiment (Chou et
al 1999; Findlay 1981), when a specific instruction to delay initiation is given (Chou et al 1999;
Coëffé and O'Regan 1987; Ottes et al 1985) or when latencies are lengthened involuntarily by
the presence of a remote distracter (McSorley and Findlay 2003).
In the latter case, Cruickshank and McSorley (2009) (also McSorley and Findlay 2003)
showed that presence of a distracter close to the target (here called a local distracter), which
would normally adversely affect saccade accuracy, has less of an influence on saccades to
target in the presence of a distracter farther from the target (here called a remote distracter).
We suggested that the remote distracter increases activity at fixation, thereby inhibiting
the initiation of the saccade (known as the remote distracter effect) (Walker et al 1995,
74 E McSorley, A G Cruickshank
1997). This followed the findings of Walker et al (1997) who showed that the extent of saccade
latency increase depended upon the relative distance of the remote distracter and target from
fixation, and not the direct distance of remote distracter from the target. An improvement in
saccade accuracy could be explained as a consequence of the increase in latency allowing
the competition that dictates the saccade landing position to be more fully developed (called
here an `indirect' route). An alternative hypothesis is that the remote distracter acts through
some more `direct' route, eg by impacting directly on activation within the competitive
process by which the saccade target is selected thus leading to an improvement in accuracy.
Certainly, it has been shown that a remote distracter reduces activity in SC at the target site
through direct inhibitory interactions between the target and remote distracter locations,
leading to an increase in saccade latency (Dorris et al 2007; Olivier et al 1999).
These different (indirect and direct) explanations for the effect of remote distracter on
saccade accuracy predict differences in the temporal development of the underlying saccade
competition when a remote distracter is added to a display containing a target and local
distracter. For the indirect route the temporal development of the competition between
the target and local distracter should be the same regardless of the presence of the remote
distracter. Remote distracter presence would increase activity at fixation but not influence
the slope of the developing competition. For the direct route, activity at the target and local
distracter site will be affected by the presence of the remote distracter. This would predict an
impact on accuracy of the saccade and on its temporal development.
Here we examine these different predictions by taking advantage of a fixation gap
paradigm (Ross and Ross 1980; Saslow 1967) which involuntarily induces changes in
the latency of saccades (speeds or slows eye movement responses) and is known to be
independent of other distracter effects (McSorley et al 2006, 2009; Walker et al 1995). This
allows us to examine the change in accuracy of target driven saccades in the presence of
either a single local distracter or both a local and a remote distracter over a wide range of
saccade latencies.
2 Method
2.1 Observers
Eight naive observers participated in the experiment. Observers ranged in age from 19 to 21
years. All observers had normal, or corrected to normal, vision. Local ethical approval was
obtained for this study, which was conducted in accordance with the standards described
in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave their informed consent prior to
inclusion.
2.2 Apparatus and materials
Stimuli were vertically oriented Gabor patches with a spatial frequency of two (target) or
four (distracter) cycles per degree (cpd), with a standard deviation of 0.3 deg and a mean
luminance of 23 cd/m2. All stimuli were presented on a grey background also with a mean
luminance of 23 cd/m2. Eye movements were recorded using a head-mounted, video-based,
eye-tracker with a sampling rate of 500 Hz (Eyelink II, SR Research), recording monocularly
from observers' right eyes. Stimuli were presented in greyscale on a 21" colour monitor
with a refresh rate of 75 Hz (DiamondPro, Sony). The stimulus presentation was handled by
in-house software developed from example code provided by SR Research. Head movements
were constrained with a chin-rest, which held the participant so that their eyes were in line
with the horizontal meridian of the screen, at a viewing distance of 1 m. The eye-tracker
was calibrated using a standard 9 point grid, carried out at the beginning of the experiment
and after any breaks where the observer removed their head from the rest or removed the
eye-tracker. Calibration was accepted only once there was an overall difference of less than
Inhibition of saccade initiation improves saccade accuracy 75
0.5 deg between the initial calibration and a validation retest; in the event of a failure to
validate, calibration was repeated.
2.3 Design
Stimuli were presented 8 deg of visual angle from fixation at an angular offset of 10 deg (see
figure 1 for an example with targets shown to the right of fixation). A target and distracter
were always present in one of two possible locations: 10 deg above horizontal or 10 deg
below (eg if the target appeared above then the distracter was in the down position and vice
versa). In the opposite hemifield a single remote distracter was present on half of the trials.
This appeared on the horizontal meridian, 4 deg from fixation. Distracters and target stimuli
appeared simultaneously. For half of the observers (four) the target appeared only on the
left while the remaining half saw targets only on the right. The fixation spot was removed
from the display either before (gap, denoted by negative numbers) or after (overlap) target
onset at stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of -150, -75, 75, or 150 ms relative to target
onset. For each SOA there were 4 conditions: 2 possible target/distracter positions (10 deg
above or below the horizontal meridian) and 2 possible remote distracter states (absent or
present). Observers completed 2 blocks of 80 trials, producing a total of 160 trials (10 trials
per condition) each.
Figure 1. Targets were restricted to appear on the right or left hand side of the screen for two separate
groups of four observers. In the example display shown, the target appears on the right, 10 deg of
visual angle from fixation, at an angular offset of 10 deg above or below the horizontal meridian. A
distracter, local to the target, also appears on the right in the mirror-opposite place to the target across
the horizontal meridian. In 50% of trials a further, remote, distracter will appear to the left of fixation,
on the horizontal meridian 10 deg of visual angle from fixation.
2.4 Procedure
Observers were familiarised with the target and distracter stimuli. Following this an introduc-
tory block of up to 20 trials was presented to introduce observers to the timing and spatial
configuration of the experimental trials. Observers were instructed to move their eyes `as
quickly and accurately as possible' to the target Gabor patch, ignoring distracters. Trials
began with a central fixation cross (+) subtending 0.5 deg of visual angle, presented for a
varying duration of between 800 and 1300 ms. Gap trials included a blank screen, shown for
either 150 ms or 75 ms, after offset of the fixation cross; overlap trials had no blank screen.
This was followed by the onset of the stimuli which were displayed for 1 s. In gap trials no
fixation cross was present with the stimuli; in overlap trials the first 75 ms or 150 ms of stimuli
also included the fixation cross, thereafter none. Finally, a blank screen was shown for 500
76 E McSorley, A G Cruickshank
ms, followed by the reappearance of the fixation cross. Once the observers eyes were fixated
(within ±0.5 deg of visual angle from fixation) the next trial commenced.
2.5 Data analysis
A parser integral to the eye-tracking software was used to identify saccade start and endpoints
using a 22 deg s-1 velocity and 8000 deg s-2 acceleration criteria (SR Research Ltd). Further
analysis was undertaken using in-house software developed in Matlab (Mathworks Inc.).
Saccade amplitude, latency, and overall direction were derived from the eye movement
records for the first saccade in each trial. Amplitude was defined as the horizontal component
of the distance between eye start and end point (in degrees of visual angle). Saccade latency
is the interval between the onset of the target and the initiation of the saccade (in ms).
Direction was defined as the angular deviation of saccade direction taken from the initial
fixation location to final endpoint in polar coordinates. Saccade accuracy was defined as the
angular deviation between the target and saccade landing position eg a value of zero shows a
saccade landing at the centre of the target, while 10 deg shows a saccade landing toward the
distracter position. Saccades were excluded from further analysis if their amplitudes were
less than two degrees (1.5%), latencies were less than 50 ms or greater then 500 ms (classed
as not being a reaction to the appearance of the stimuli, 0.01%), or a blink occurred during
the saccade (0.25%).
3 Results
Figure 2 shows mean saccade latency for each SOA, collapsed across subjects, dependent
upon contralateral distracter presence. A two-factor ANOVA (SOA by distracter) showed a
monotonic increase in saccade latency as SOA turns from a gap to an overlap between fixation
and stimuli onset [main effect of SOA: F3,21 = 34.4,p<0.01]. While maintaining this pattern
Figure 2. Saccade latency (ms) is shown as a function of fixation marker stimulus onset asynchrony
(SOA) (ms). Saccade latency was found to increase as the SOA of the fixation marker changed from a
gap (-150 and -75) to overlap (75 and 150). This gap effect pattern was the same regardless of remote
distracter presence. Remote distracter presence induced an overall slowing of saccade latency showing
a similar remote distracter effect regardless of SOA. Repeated measures error bars are shown (Loftus
and Masson 1994).
Inhibition of saccade initiation improves saccade accuracy 77
(ie no interaction: F<1), saccade latency increased further when the contralateral distracter
was present compared with its absence [main effect of distracter: F1,7 = 14.1,p<0.01].
Figure 3. Saccade accuracy (in terms of angular deviation from the centre of the target stimulus)
is shown as a function saccade latency depending on remote distracter presence. Mean accuracy
was determined for successive 20% portions of the saccade latency distribution from shortest to
longest. These are plotted across the means of those latency bins. Accuracy was found to improve as
latency increased whether a remote distracter was present or not. The fits shown are linear and show
no significant changes in slope or intercept when the remote distracter was present. The accuracy
improvements found in the presence of the remote distracter reflect a similar temporal development
of saccade competition as found when only the local distracter was present. Repeated measures error
bars are shown (Loftus and Masson 1994).
To examine the effect of saccade latency on saccade accuracy (the angular error of the
saccade landing position relative to the target position), the latency distribution was quintiled
for each contralateral distracter condition, separately for each subject. The mean saccade
accuracy deviation and its corresponding mean latency were determined for successive
20% portions of the saccade latency distribution (data were not separated by fixation gap
intervals). These were averaged across subjects and are shown in figure 3. It is clear that, as
the latency of the saccade increases, its corresponding accuracy improves. To explore this
relationship further the best linear fits were determined for each contralateral distracter
condition separately for each subject. All data were well captured by these fits except for one
observer in the NO remote distracter condition [r2 = 0.1; mean r2 otherwise: absent = 0.41
(range 0.2 to 0.78); present = 0.7 (range 0.27 to 0.91)]. Two separate one-sample t-tests show
that slopes from all subjects in both contralateral distracter conditions significantly differ
from zero [absent: t(7) = -4.5; present: t(7) = -5.5, p<0.01] indicating that accuracy improves
as saccade latency increases. A paired t-test shows no difference between the slopes for
each distracter condition [t(7) = 1.3, ns] suggesting that the contralateral distracter improves
saccade accuracy by increasing the latency of the saccade in the similar manner to that
which occurs when the distracter is absent. The overall linear fits to each remote distracter
condition are plotted on figure 3.

4 Discussion
When making saccades to targets which have distracting stimuli close by, we find an accuracy
benefit gained from the presence of a visual distracter remote from their location (see also
Cruickshank and McSorley 2009; McSorley and Findlay 2003). Remote distracter effects on
accuracy have been ascribed to a lengthening of the saccadic response time made in its
presence. We find that manipulation of saccade latency showed an improvement in saccade
accuracy as latency increased. The addition of the remote distracter did not change the
pattern of improvement; rather, presence of remote distracter appears to increase latency
and access the competition between the target and local distracter at a later time, thus
producing more accurate saccades. This suggests action of the remote distracter is indirect
(Walker et al 1997): the temporal development of saccade competition does not change as
the remote distracter does not directly influence it. We suggest that remote distracters act
along an indirect route which impairs disengagement from fixation, perhaps via long range
inhibitory interactions (Gandhi and Keller 1995) which serve to increase activity around
fixation, and inhibit the initiation of the saccade. This allows competition between the local
distracter and the target to be more developed prior to its reaching a critical threshold for
movement initiation allowing more accurate saccades to be made. A direct route, in which
the remote distracter interacts more directly with target and local distracter and therefore
impacts on the competition taking place between them, would have predicted the temporal
development of saccade competition would be modified in some way by remote distracter
presence. Our data do not fit with this explanation (see also the findings of Cruickshank and
McSorley 2009; McSorley and Findlay 2003).
It is interesting to note that accuracy improves until saccade latency is around 200 ms at
which point there is some suggestion in figure 3 that it worsens again (that is, landing position
starts to deviate away from the target in the opposite direction to the local distracter). This is
very similar to the pattern of deviations found in the trajectories of target driven saccades
made in the presence of a distracter (Godijn and Theeuwes 2004; McSorley et al 2006, 2009;
Walker et al 2006). Saccade trajectories are found to deviate toward the distracter location
when they have a short latency but deviate away as latencies increase. The saccade latency at
which the direction of trajectory deviation changes from toward to away from the distracter
(ie when the trajectory is straight) is also around 200 ms. The few data reported in this
paper which support this similarity are suggestive, but further work exploring longer saccade
latencies would be necessary to establish the temporal development of the inhibition of the
local distracter on saccade landing position.
Our results fit well with recent models of saccade programming. In these models the
competition which determines where and when saccades are directed is determined on
motor maps which are organised topographically throughout the visual/motor system
(Findlay and Walker 1999; Godijn and Theeuwes 2002; Kopecz 1995; Trappenberg et al
2001) like those identified in superior colliculus, frontal eye fields, and lateral intraparietal
area. Visual areas of interest, such as different potential targets, are represented across these
as neural peaks of activation with overlapping receptive fields (eg Bruce and Goldberg 1985;
Goldberg et al 2006; Lee et al 1988), with excitatory connections to nearby receptive fields
and inhibitory connections to those further away (Hikosaka 1989; Hikosaka et al 2000; Munoz
and Istvan 1998; Sommer and Wurtz 2004a, 2004b; Wurtz and Sommer 2004). Competition
between possible saccade targets takes place within these motor maps until a single area
of activation exceeds threshold and the saccade is initiated to that point (Hanes and Schall
1996; Ratcliff et al 2007). The landing position of a saccade is a consequence of distributed
population coding over large overlapping receptive or movement fields in the superior
colliculus, which form a saliency map (Lee et al 1988; McIlwain 1986, 1991). When possible
Inhibition of saccade initiation improves saccade accuracy 79
visual targets are close together (within ± 20 deg), they activate overlapping movement fields,
resulting in a single large peak of activity. In these cases saccades tend to land between
the stimuli, at the peak of activation (this is known as the global effect or centre of gravity
effect). The extent of the deviation in landing position reflects the relative neural activation
at each stimulus site (Findlay and Benson 2006; Glimcher and Sparks 1993; Ottes et al 1985;
van Opstal and van Gisbergen 1989; Walker et al 1997). Landing position deviations from
the target arise when sites representing multiple stimuli are active and the saccade will land
between them. A shorter latency saccade is generated when activation produced by the onset
of the stimuli quickly exceeds threshold, resulting in inhibition of fixation activity. Owing
to the overlapping receptive field properties of the saccadic system the landing position is
likely to be influenced by activation produced by each stimulus close to the target location.
Saccades will become progressively more accurate as the activation at the target location
increases and that of the other stimuli diminishes through competitive processes which
takes time, thus longer latency saccades are more accurate saccades.
Stimuli which are farther apart affect when the saccade is initiated but do not affect where
the saccade lands (this is known as the remote distracter effect; Born and Kerzel 2008; Honda
2005; Ludwig et al 2005; Walker et al 1995, 1997). The remote distracter effect occurs even
when observers know which side of fixation the target will appear on, suggesting that it is
an automatic effect not subject to voluntary control (Benson 2008; Walker et al 1995, 2000).
Walker et al (1997) found that the magnitude of the remote distracter effect diminishes with
relative distance of the target and distracter from fixation, as opposed to distance of the
distracter from the target. This led them to suggest that that the remote distracter acts via
long range inhibitory interactions (as reported by Gandhi and Keller 1995) on cells in the
rostral pole of the superior colliculus (Munoz and Wurtz 1995a, 1995b) by maintaining tonic
activation and thus inhibiting when a saccade can be initiated (Munoz and Wurtz 1993).
Contrary to Walker et al (1997), others have reported that increasing distracter distance from
the target (rather than fixation) induces the remote distracter effect (Dorris et al 2007; Olivier
et al 1999). They show that neuronal activity in superior colliculus at the target location is
inhibited when distracters are shown at remote distances from the target. However, given the
restricted set of distracter distances from target (two: near and far) and the timing differences
between distracter and target onset (distracter was onset 200 ms prior to the target) employed
by Dorris et al (2007), it is not clear which of these two explanations underlie the remote
distracter effect. It is notable that our results fit better with the former explanation for an
impact of the remote distracter on fixational disengagement. A further test of our findings
would be to manipulate the position of the remote distracter (temporally and spatially) in the
manner reported by Walker et al (1997). Our prediction is that the accuracy of the saccade
should be dependent wholly on the latency of the saccade regardless of remote distracter
placement.
In conclusion, we suggest that the involuntary increase in saccade latency induced by a
remote distracter inhibits the onset of the saccade by increasing fixation related activation. As
the competition between stimuli progresses the point of highest activation shifts towards the
target. Thus, the involuntary increase in saccade initiation latency induced by the presence
of a remote distracter improves target localisation by accessing the underlying competition
which determines its identity at a later, and more finely resolved, stage of processing.
