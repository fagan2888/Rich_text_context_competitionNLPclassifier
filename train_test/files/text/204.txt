Historically, there has been a large gap between African Americans and Whites in access to health care, but this
gap was ostensibly lessened by the advent of Medicare and Medicaidfor older adults in the mid 1960s. The extent to
which older African Americans continue to receive less access to medical care as a result of economic inequalities,
institutionalized forms of discrimination, and life-style factors remains a subject of policy debate. Empirical enquiry
has produced inconsistent results. The purpose of this study is to test the same set of models of medical use using
identically measured predictor variables in three nationally representative data sets of older Americans: 1984 Study
of Aging (SOA); 1984 National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTC); and the 1987 National Medical Care Expenditure
Survey (NMES). Multivariate logistic regression of use of physician and hospital services and Poisson regression of
amount of service use identified inconsistent results in race differences across data sets, but consistent results in
terms of the importance of health status and insurance as predictors of use and amount of use. The findings suggest
that health status and financial resources may be more relevant areas for policy interventions than considerations
related to race and ethnicity.
ACCESS to medical care involves a mixture of individ-
L ual and professional decisions. Individuals enter the
system through a visit to a physician, usually at their own
discretion, whereas follow-up physician visits may be a
function of the practice pattern of the provider (Andersen
and Newman, 1973; Wolinsky et al., 1989). From the per-
spective of individual choice, hospitalization remains a less
discretionary activity, with access and amount being influ-
enced by health professional assessments of severity and
type of illness. Inequitable access occurs when social struc-
ture and other enabling resources rather than health needs
determine who gets medical care (Andersen, 1995; Ander-
sen and Newman, 1973). Historically, there has been a
large gap between African Americans and Whites in access
to health care. The advent of Medicare and Medicaid for
older adults in the mid 1960s created a social context in
which racial differences in use of medical services were
potentially leveled out by access to medical care insurance
by almost all persons aged 65 or older (Davis, 1991). This
goal has been achieved in part as the differences between
older African Americans and Whites in access to medical
care have narrowed since the passage of Medicare and
Medicaid (Davis, 1991; Sorlie et al., 1992). Yet, the extent
to which older African Americans continue to receive less
access to medical care as a result of economic inequalities,
institutionalized forms of discrimination, and life-style fac-
tors remains a subject of policy debate and empirical en-
quiry (Davis, 1991; Jackson, 1988; Williams, Lavizzo-
Mourey, and Warren, 1994).
Empirical comparisons of older African Americans' and
Whites' use of health services have produced inconsistent
results. African Americans have been reported as making
fewer physician visits (Gornick et al., 1996), more visits
(Mutchler and Burr, 1991), or showing no difference in use
than comparable Whites (Wan, 1989). Studies of hospital
use show similar inconsistencies (Graves, 1990; Kominski
and Witsberger, 1993; Mutchler and Burr, 1991). These in-
consistencies are due, in part, to differences in study de-
signs, measurement strategies, time frames, and samples.
Studies at the community level or of specific medical con-
ditions are more likely to identify race differences in access
and treatment than are national level data. Much of the em-
pirical evidence is characterized by definitional and mea-
surement ambiguity of race and service use and reliance on
varying sources of data at different levels of specificity of
care (see Wolinsky, 1994, for a detailed critique).
Research on race differences in use of services has not
incorporated multiple data sets, multiple measures of health
service use, and multiple types of utilization using the same
model. The purpose of this study is to test the same set of
models of medical use using identically measured predictor
variables in three nationally representative data sets of
older Americans: 1984 Study of Aging (SOA); 1984 Na-
tional Long-Term Care Survey (NLTC); and the 1987
National Medical Care Expenditure Survey (NMES). This
approach provides an opportunity to examine the extent to
which indicators of health and social structure explain vari-
ations in service use by older African Americans and
Whites using high-quality national data. We believe that
this investigation contributes to the inequity debate in two
S325

ways: (1) By incorporating a range of health and social
structural factors that have been found to differ between
African Americans and Whites, we can determine the ex-
tent to which race differences or similarities in access are
robust and consistent across discretionary use of physician
care and less discretionary use of hospitals; (2) By holding
constant the health and social structural independent vari-
ables across conceptually similar, but differentially mea-
sured dependent variables of utilization and amount of use
in nationally representative samples based on different sam-
pling frames, we will be able to identify possible contribu-
tions of sampling bias on results. Conceptual replication of
findings across data sets leads to validation of the extent to
which historical changes in the organization and financing
of medical services have improved the ability of older
African Americans and Whites to gain access to care.
Conceptual Model
Our conceptual model adapts the behavioral model re-
search tradition of service use (Andersen and Newman,
1973; Wolinsky, 1994) by specifying a set of need variables
based on indicators of health status and social structural in-
dicators that represent predisposing and enabling variables.
We thus modify the usual tripartite division of predispos-
ing, enabling, and need in order to isolate the effect of race
from health and other social structural variables.
There are two perspectives on the ways in which race
may influence medical service use. The interactive model
states that the effects of health and social structure on ser-
vice use differ by race. The rationale for this model is based
on the assumption that race permeates all aspects of an in-
dividual's life. In most studies, measurement of race is
based on the problematic assumption of homogeneity
within race groups, i.e., the use of one dichotomous vari-
able to serve as a marker variable representing alleged bio-
logical, cultural, social, and economic differences between
African American and White individuals (Hahn, 1992; La
Veist, 1994; White-Means, 1995; Williams, Lavizzo-
Mourey, and Warren, 1994; Wolinsky, 1994). To counter
this assumption, research efforts have begun to examine in-
teraction effects between race and need, or race and socio-
economic status to capture intragroup heterogeneity and
greater sensitivity to health and socioeconomic characteris-
tics among minority groups (Mutran and Ferraro, 1988;
White-Means, 1995; Wolinsky et al., 1989; Wolinsky and
Johnson, 1991).
The more typical use of the behavioral framework of ser-
vice use is a mediating model that introduces variables to
control for (or explain) differences in medical service use be-
tween older African Americans and Whites. This model as-
sumes that the association between race and service use is in-
direct, mediated by health and social structural variables, and
that factors predicting service use operate in similar ways for
African Americans and Whites. Larger race differences may
be more likely to occur between African Americans and
Whites in use of physicians as this is a more discretionary
activity -- subject to individual and cultural definitions of
need -- than is hospital use, which is governed more by
provider, insurance, and institutional factors. But the predic-
tors of service use should not vary by race per se.
Evidence exists to support both interpretations of race
and service use for both types of medical care. Wan's
(1989) review of studies based on the Andersen behavioral
model identified no effect of race on physician contact or
number of visits, and mixed effects of income and insur-
ance on access. Mutchler and Burr (1991), in an analysis of
the 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation,
found that African Americans made more visits to health
care professionals, net of socioeconomic status, but the as-
sociation between heed, social characteristics, and number
of visits was the same for African Americans and Whites.
Studies of physician care for specific health conditions
[e.g., chest pain (Strogatz, 1990) and glaucoma (Javitt et
al., 1991)] show associations between race, poverty levels
of income, and less use or undertreatment. The proclivity
for lower income African Americans to use emergency
rooms as a source of alternative treatment to physician care
has also been documented (Neighbors, 1986; White-Means
and Thornton, 1989).
Patterned behaviors associated with health providers and
insurance reimbursement rather than demographic factors
appear to drive use of hospital care more than use of physi-
cian services (Stump, Johnson, and Wolinsky, 1995; Wil-
son, Griffith, and Tedeschi, 1985; Wolinsky, Stump, and
Johnson, 1995). Longer hospital stays have been associated
with low income, absence of a prepaid health care plan, no
regular source of care, and area hospital bed supply (Wan,
1982; Wilson, Griffith, and Tedeschi, 1985). To cite one ex-
ample of the complexity of findings: Mutchler and Burr
(1991) report that their initial finding that African Ameri-
cans had fewer hospital days disappeared when socioeco-
nomic status was controlled; in separate analyses by race,
however, lower income was associated with more hospital
days for African Americans, whereas higher income was
associated with more hospital days for Whites. Hospital and
disease-based studies at the community level document
many instances in which African Americans are disadvan-
taged in health care (e.g., Yergan et al., 1987). A compre-
hensive examination of linked Medicare hospital and record
claims with median income by zip code found that African
Americans and lower income persons of all races received
less preventive care and less optimal management of
chronic diseases. The authors concluded that race was the
overriding determinant of disparities in care (Gornick et al.,
1996). Yet, according to hospital discharge surveys, race
differences in hospital use are becoming smaller as length
of stay declines steadily (Kominski and Witsberger, 1993;
Pokras et al., 1990).
Health status indicators of disease, self-reported health,
and functional status mediate the effect of race on service
use by determining the need for care -- the biggest pre-
dictor of service use, regardless of other predisposing and
enabling variables (Wolinsky, 1994). By most measures, the
health of older African Americans is poorer than that
of older Whites across the range of acute and chronic ill-
nesses (Andersen, Mullner, and Cornelius, 1989; Bacquet,
1988; Blesch and Furner, 1993; Ferraro, 1987, 1993; Ford
et al., 1990; Gibson, 1994; Jackson, 1988; Manton, Patrick,
and Johnson, 1987; Manuel, 1988; Markides and Mindel,
1987; Mermelstein et al., 1993). Further evidence of poorer
RACE AND MEDICAL CARE S327
health status among African Americans is found in mor-
tality studies that confirm higher death rates for African
Americans than Whites for many diseases, e.g., heart dis-
ease, malignant neoplasms, and cerebrovascular diseases
(Gibson, 1994; Johnson and Wolinsky, 1994). Even evi-
dence of the crossover effect in which African Americans
over age 75 appear more advantaged in health and mortality
than comparable older Whites (Gibson, 1991, 1994; Manton,
Patrick, and Johnson, 1987) has now been seriously ques-
tioned (Elmo and Preston, 1994). Thus, expectations of
health service use must be viewed in the context
of the strong evidence that, as a group, older African
Americans experience serious health disadvantages. These
differences cannot be easily traced to measurement ambigu-
ities. Analysis of the structure of health status identified
race differences in measurement models of health, but not
in the relationship between disease, disability, functional
limitations, and perceived health (Johnson and Wolinsky,
1994).
A key interpretation for the differentials in health status
between African Americans and Whites is socioeconomic
status (SES) and inequitable distribution of social re-
sources. Social structural factors mediate the effect of ser-
vice use in two ways. First, lower SES is strongly associ-
ated with poorer health, mortality, and morbidity (for
reviews see House et al., 1990; Williams, 1990). Older
African Americans compared to their White counterparts
have greater poverty, less educational attainment, and more
varied sources of income (Chen, 1991). Health differences
between African Americans and Whites should thus be
minimized when SES is controlled (Jackson, 1988; Markides
and Mindel, 1987), but the evidence is equivocal. Some
researchers find that African Americans and Whites have
similar levels of health once socioeconomic differences are
taken into account (Mutchler and Burr, 1991), whereas
others find differences remain even after controlling for
education and income (Ferraro, 1987; Sorlie et al., 1992).
Secondly, social structural factors influence access di-
rectly through availability of insurance coverage and other
financial resources that influence medical decision making
of individuals and institutions. Medicare coverage alone is
not sufficient to promote effective patterns of use by all
beneficiaries. The use of deductibles and copayments under
Medicare creates situations in which economic resources
and private insurance coverage continue to be important in
accessing and using medical care (Davis, 1991; Gornick et
al., 1996). Although those at the lowest levels of income or
on welfare are Medicaid eligible, eligibility is limited and
not necessarily associated with good quality of care.
In sum, this review demonstrates that the relationships
between race, socioeconomic status, and health service use
are complex and reveal few clear patterns. Despite hints,
however, of minimal race differences in access to medical
care in recent years, our knowledge remains limited by the
many variations and inconsistencies in study findings. By
conceptually replicating the same model across three na-
tional data sets, this research will isolate consistent findings
about the association between race, health, social structure,
and service use from those dependent on sampling defini-
tion and measurement strategies.
METHOD
Samples
Supplement on Aging (SOA). -- The SOA was a supple-
ment to the 1984 annual Health Interview Survey with a
telephone survey of community-dwelling individuals aged
55 years or older. (See Fitti and Kovar, 1987, for details on
the sample design and procedures.) We selected those indi-
viduals aged 70 and over from this sample that form the
baseline for the Longitudinal Study on Aging. We drew on
the parent Health Interview Survey for our measures of
health self-report and income to minimize missing data and
proxy reports. The SOA analytic subsample consisted of
White (unweighted n = 6681) and African American (un-
weighted n = 555) respondents aged 70 and older in 1984.
National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTC). -- This sur-
vey investigated the demographic characteristics, health and
functioning, and patterns of assistance of a national sample
of noninstitutionalized frail persons 65 years of age or
older. A random sample of approximately 36,000 persons
drawn from Medicare enrollment files was screened in
1982 to identify persons with functional limitations, defined
as the inability to perform at least one activity of personal
care (ADL) or management of daily affairs (IADL) for a
period of 3 months or more. More than 6,400 persons were
identified and 95.3 percent were interviewed. This sample
was followed up in 1984 and 1989. In addition, subsamples
of the nondisabled-community residents identified in 1982
and those passing their 65th birthday by April 1, 1984 were
screened and interviewed in 1984. After excluding respon-
dents under the age of 70, the NLTC analytic subsample
consisted of White (n = 3638) and African American (n =
513) frail older persons. There was no significant difference
by race in the exclusion of those aged 65 to 69 years. (See
Manton, 1988, and Manton, Corder, and Stallard, 1993, for
detailed discussions of the 1984 survey methodology.)
The National Medical Expenditures Survey (NMES). --
This survey was based on a national stratified area probabil-
ity design of households. The sample contained approxi-
mately 36,000 individuals with oversampling of elderly,
poor and near poor, African Americans and Hispanics, and
persons with functional limitations. Four rounds of personal
and telephone interviews occurred at 4-month intervals for
the study reference year of 1987. The NMES analytic sub-
sample consisted of 2800 White older persons and 421
African Americans aged 70 and over. There was no signifi-
cant difference by race in the exclusion of those aged 65 to
69 years. (See Cohen, DiGaetano, and Waksberg, 1991;
Leon and Lair, 1990; and Short and Leon, 1990, for de-
tailed discussions of NMES methodology.)
Although the analytic subsamples are comparable in age
range and variable selection, other remaining sample differ-
ences should be kept in mind. First, we did not restrict the
samples to the definition of frailty (defined as 3 months
limitation or more) used in the NLTC because medical ser-
vice use is a response to acute as well as chronic illness.
Second, we do not know how variations in sampling de-
S328 MILLER ETAL.
signs (e.g., use of a Medicare list sample in NLTC versus
household-based samples in NMES and SOA) affect differ-
ences in sample composition. Finally, there is a 3-year dif-
ference between the data collection for the SOA and NLTC
in 1984, and the NMES in 1987. The health care system
was undergoing transitions during that period to a prospec-
tive payment system on a state-by-state basis. The sample
differences suggest alternative hypotheses for interpreting
differences in study findings by data set. For example, we
would expect higher use of physician and hospital services
by the chronically disabled population of NLTC and shorter
average lengths of stay among NMES respondents. Yet,
there is little prime facie evidence to suspect that the pat-
tern of associations between race, health, social structure,
and service use would vary by data set if we assume an
equitable process of service use. The variations in data set
design also increase the generalizability of consistent find-
ings across data sets.
Measures
Our choice of measures was guided by selection of items
with established reliability and validity and by the compa-
rability of measures across data sets. Thus, we compro-
mised by excluding some variables that have occasionally
been shown to influence use of medical services (e.g.,
urban/rural residence) when there were not comparable
metrics. Preliminary analyses within each data set encom-
passing a wider variety of predictor variables did not indi-
cate any changes in our conclusions about the influence of
race on medical service utilization.
Table 1 presents the list of variables. Most of the mea-
sures are straightforward. All of the health variables, in-
cluding self-reported health, were scored with higher values
representing poorer health. Family income, education, and
self-health ratings had sufficient missing data to warrant
imputation of missing data. The missing values for educa-
tion (SOA, 1.8%; NLTC, 4.5%; NMES, 4%) were imputed
to age- and race-specific means. Missing data for income
(SOA, 17.8%; NLTC, 9.7%) were imputed to mean values
by level of education and race. Missing cases of self-health
ratings (SOA, 0.7%; NLTC, 7.7%) were assigned the global
mean value because of the relatively small proportion miss-
ing and the restricted range of measurement. Missing val-
ues in income and self-health ratings in NMES were im-
puted prior to data tape release by either logical or hot-deck
imputation. Like most health surveys, health status mea-
sures gathered at the time of the interview may vary in time
frame from measures of utilization that recall use in prior
months.
Measurement of the dependent variables varied by data
set in two ways: the definition of medical care and the time
frame used for recall of service events. As shown in Table
1, the definition of physician visits varied. SOA included
seeing doctors in emergency room and hospital clinic visits
in one item; NLTC specified a visit in a doctor's office; and
NMES asked about seeing a medical doctor (site unspeci-
fied). The time frame for recall of physician visits also
varied. SOA used the time frame of the previous 12
months; NLTC asked about the previous month; and NMES
collected these data every 4 months over 1 year. Definitions

mittance and discharge in the same day in addition to any
overnight stay in the hospital during the prior 4 months. We
aggregated the 4-month recall period for NMES to one year
for all medical use variables.
Proxy respondents were used in all data sets if the re-
spondent was unable to respond. There were no significant
race differences in proxy rate. However, because NMES
was a household, rather than individual-based survey, the
proxy rate was higher (approximately 34% compared to ap-
proximately 20-25% in the other two surveys). Proxies
who were adult children or grandchildren may have been
less aware of medical care use of the older respondent than
spouse proxies, although efforts were made to verify re-
ports with medical bills during the in-person interview.
RACE AND MEDICAL CARE S329
Comparison of Samples by Race Across
and Within Data Sets
Across data sets. -- The SOA contained the smallest
proportion of African American respondents, 7.6 percent,
compared to 12-13 percent in NLTC and NMES. The dis-
tributions of gender, age, education, and region across the
data sets were similar (Table 2). There are slight differences
by data set in other respondent characteristics. SOA and
NMES represent more affluent respondents than NLTC, as
evidenced by the greater proportions with higher incomes,
private insurance, and lower percent Medicaid. Respon-
dents in NMES were more likely to live alone than respon-
dents in the other two surveys. Reflecting differences in se-
lection criteria, respondents in NLTC were the least healthy
on all measures, with relatively little difference between
those in SOA and NMES.
Within data sets. -- Race differences in sociodemo-
graphic variables were similar to those noted in other stud-
ies. Given the accumulation of lifetime differentials in so-
cial and economic resources, older Whites had more years
of education, higher income, greater likelihood of private
insurance, and were more likely to live alone. African
Americans were more likely to use Medicaid and to live in
the South. African Americans reported slightly poorer
physical health than Whites within each data set, with
significantly more ADL and IADL limitations, physical
performance limitations, and poorer self-health ratings.
Thus, on average, older African Americans exhibited over-
all poorer health than older Whites within each data set, but
severity of health status differed across the data sets.
Analytic Strategy
We analyzed physician and hospitalization utilization
separately. Utilization is represented by two variables: con-
tact or use versus non-use (dichotomous) and amount of
service (continuous). Contact variables are analyzed using
logistic regression. Logistic regression estimates were ob-
tained using SUDAAN software (Shah et al., 1991) in order
to obtain unbiased estimates of standard errors in the face
of the clustered samples found in all three data sets.
The counts of numbers of physician visits and days of
hospitalization do not lend themselves to simple OLS re-
gression because the distribution is badly skewed. Standard
fixes for this problem (e.g., recoding extreme values or tak-
ing logs) have various disadvantages. A useful approach is
based on the Poisson regression model, or a variant of it
known as the negative binomial model (Greene, 1993,
1995; McCullagh and Nelder, 1983). In the standard Pois-
son model, the distribution of the dependent variable is as-
sumed to follow a one-parameter Poisson distribution with
variance equal to the mean. The negative binomial model
allows overdispersion in the data, i.e., a distribution with
variance greater than the mean. The overdispersion mea-
sure, usually referred to as a "scale parameter," is estimated
from the data. Coefficients for a Poisson or negative bino-
mial model provide estimates of the increment in the log of
the dependent variable for unit increment in each indepen-
dent variable. Exponentiating the coefficients gives percent
increments in Y for unit changes in X (Greene, 1993). We
present the exponentiated coefficients for ease of interpreta-
tion. Poisson regression coefficients, standard errors, and
the scale parameter are available from the first author on re-
quest. SUDAAN does not yet contain a Poisson routine, so
we obtained the negative binomial estimates using the SAS
GENMOD procedure. Standard errors from these results
must be interpreted with caution. Our experience to date
suggests that SUDAAN estimates of standard errors, com-
pared to a program assuming simple random sampling,
show only minor differences. We expect the same would be
true for Poisson/negative binomial estimates.

vices differed by race involved creating multiplicative inter-
action terms of race by predictors of service use (see Table
1 for the list of independent variables). We tested the inter-
action model in two ways. First, we entered all the interac-
tion terms for a global test, as the final step in the hierarchi-
cal model. We found no significant increase in chi-square
within any of the data sets, concluding that there were no
interaction effects by race. The literature suggests that in-
teractions between race and health, and race and socioeco-
nomic status are most relevant to service use. We thus
tested interaction terms containing each set of variables
separately, but once again found no effect. We thus con-
clude that the determinants of medical service use do not
differ by race. (Data are not shown; results may be re-
quested from the first author.)
Mediating model analysis. -- We tested the mediating
model of race, health, and social structure through a hierar-
chical process and present the results from this analysis. We
introduced race alone to determine its global effect before
partialing out compositional differences. Each model con-
tained all the variables in the preceding model. The order of
models was (1) Race; (2) Health: self-reported health sta-
tus, ADL and IADL limitations, and physical performance
limitations; and (3) Socio-structural: gender, age, educa-
tion, region, proxy respondent; income, private insurance,
Medicaid, and living arrangement. If the race variable re-
mained significant after entering the other model variables,
we concluded that other explanatory variables were needed
to interpret how race affects use of services. Since this is
cross-sectional data, any causal implications implied by this
order are suggestive only.
RESULTS
Prevalence and Extent of Medical Utilization
We first present percentage use of medical services and
amount of use by race and data set (Table 3). Given the
documented poorer health of African Americans, we would
expect that a higher proportion of African Americans than
Whites would have a physician visit or a hospital stay. Yet,
this was not the case across data sets. Estimates of physi-
cian contact showed no significant race difference in SOA
or NLTC. There was lower use of physicians by African
Americans compared to Whites in NMES (75.3% com-
pared to 87.6%). A different pattern emerged in estimates
of the mean number of physician visits by those who used a
physician. There were no race differences in mean number
of visits in NLTC and NMES, but African Americans had
almost twice as many physician visits as Whites in SOA.
We suspect this occurred because emergency room visits
were included in the question wording. Because of the dif-
ference in recall time frame and definitional differences,
mean values of use and amount of physician visits are not
truly comparable across surveys.
No significant race difference in any hospital stay oc-
curred in two of the three data sets (SOA and NMES). In
NLTC, a greater proportion of Whites reported a hospital
stay than African Americans. Between 20-35 percent of the
total sample used hospitals in the preceding year, depend-
ing on the data set. The mean number of hospital inpatient
days were similar across data sets for those who reported an
overnight stay in the hospital (12-13.6 days), with no sig-
nificant differences between African American and White
older persons.
Multivariate Analysis of Physician Utilization
Physician contact. -- As noted, differential use of a
physician by race varied by data set (Table 4). Panel A pre-
sents the odds ratio of race in each successive model. These
patterns did not change after introducing controls for health
status and social structural variables. In SOA, African
Americans were less likely to use a physician than Whites
when just health status was taken into account, but this dif-
ference was removed when social structural factors were in-
cluded in the model. Given the health differential between
African Americans and Whites, the interim finding suggests
the possibility of access differentials that are removed when
controls for income, education, and insurance or Medicaid
are taken into account. In NMES, there was a consistent
pattern of less use of physicians by older African Ameri-
cans, even after introducing the control variables. As Panel
B shows, financial enabling factors of insurance and Medi-
caid, and health factors of poor health rating and physical
limitations were the consistent predictors of physician con-
tact.

dents. Results were consistent within each data set, but dif-
fer considerably in direction across data sets. In SOA,
African Americans had more physician visits than Whites
by a factor of 1.5. NLTC showed no difference by race. In
NMES, African Americans had significantly fewer physi-
cian visits than Whites, although the amount of difference
was less than that in SOA. There were data set variations in
the effect of ADL and IADLs on physician visits. Number
of ADL and IADL limitations were associated with number
of physician visits only in SOA. Self-reported health and
insurance status remained consistent predictors across all
data sets. Those with poorer health and either a higher in-
come, private insurance, or Medicaid were likely to have
more physician visits. Self-reported poor health was the
only health predictor of number of visits in NLTC, where
there was a more restricted time period.
Multivariate Analysis of Hospital Utilization

is no difference by race in hospital use. These patterns did
not change after introducing controls for health status and

became most pronounced in SOA when health and social
structural variables were controlled. The pattern of predic-
tors varied somewhat by data set (Table 6, Panel B). The

data sets were poor health rating and gender (i.e., women
had fewer contacts). Within SOA and NLTC, financial and
insurance status remained significant predictors. Oddly,
within NMES, only gender, poor health rating, and number
of physical limitations were significant predictors of hos-
pital use.
Amount of hospital use. -- Table 7 presents the exponen-
tiated negative binomial regression coefficients for the pre-
dictor variables of amount of hospitalization for all respon-
dents. Controlling for health and sociodemographic and
financial factors, there were no race differences in NMES
or SOA and consistently fewer hospital days for African
Americans in NLTC (Panel A). Significant predictors of
number of hospital days once again represent the primary
contributions of health status and financial factors in addi-
tion to the pattern of race differences described previously
(Panel B).
DISCUSSION
Like much of the literature, our comparative analysis of
race differences in use and amount of medical services in
three national surveys produced inconsistent results in
terms of identifying access differentials in medical service
use. Results were more consistent in terms of the lack of
explanation of race effects by the health and social struc-
tural factors. Because of the multiplicity of utilization vari-
ables and data sets, we include Table 8 as a summary of the
findings. The patterns suggest that African Americans are

less likely to use health care services than Whites, espe-
cially in terms of hospitalization. Our supposition that there
would be more race differences in use of discretionary
physician services than hospital services was not supported.
No race differences were identified in physician use in
two of the data sets, but in NMES, older African Americans
were less likely to report use of physician services, even
when taking health status and sociodemographics into ac-
count. The NLTC survey had the most restrictive sampling
frame; the lack of a significant race difference suggests that
among those with chronic functional limitations, older
African Americans and Whites have more equal access to
physician services. The larger number of doctor visits in
SOA by African Americans suggests that African Ameri-
cans use more varied health care settings as suggested by
White-Means (1995), including emergency rooms and hos-
pital clinics. This interpretation may be indirectly con-
firmed by the fewer physician visits reported by African
Americans in NMES, where measurement of visits to doc-
tors' offices was determined more precisely.
Inconsistent findings of race differences were also appar-
ent in the analyses of hospital use. Older African Americans
were less likely to have an overnight hospital stay than
Whites, according to SOA and NLTC, with no significant
race difference in NMES. Once in the hospital, however,
few differences in length of stay occurred. Only NLTC re-
ported longer length of stays among White older persons
compared to their African American peers, controlling for
socioeconomic factors and health status. These findings
suggest possible restrictions to hospital access and care for
African Americans, although the source of these differen-
tials could not be detected in this study.
These results suggest that the difference in sampling
frames and time of data collection may have influenced dif-
ferences across data sets. The broader sample design of the
SOA represented a relatively healthier group of older per-
sons than did the NLTC. We cannot easily assess how the
year panel design of NMES affected results, but note that
NMES results differed consistently from those in SOA and
NLTC. The more careful measurement approach including
validation of doctor and hospital visits by record checks
and shorter time frame for recall may be contributing fac-
tors (See Jobe et al., 1990, for discussion of optimal recall
time approaches). Differences in timing of the study inter-
views, especially the 3-year lag between the SOA and
NLTC compared to NMES, may be important. Hospital use
continued to decline drastically during this period as a re-
sult of growing use of DRGs, although it is not clear why it
may have declined more for African Americans than for
Whites.

RACE AND MEDICAL CARE S333
This inconsistency in findings by data set makes it diffi-
cult to interpret possible effects of time differences. Al-
though we believe we achieved comparability in the mea-
surement of the independent variables, we could not alter
the variations in exact wording of the dependent variable.
The difference between "seeing or talking to a physician or
assistant" (SOA) versus "receiving medical care in a physi-
cian's office" (NLTC) may have substantial effects not only
upon estimates of prevalence, but also in interpretation by
the respondent. Yet, the greater consistency in wording of
the hospital use item, i.e., "stay overnight in hospital," did
not lead to greater consistency in analytic results.
We did find consistent results in two ways. First, in no
instance did the introduction of controls for health or social
structural factors change the pattern of findings within each
data set. Second, other predictor variables, especially insur-
ance status and health status, consistently affected use of
medical services across the data sets.
We offer two possible interpretations for the lack of ex-
planation of race differences by health or social structure.
From the perspective of cultural interpretations of race dif-
ferences, we were able to measure only a small subset of
the range of variables that the marker variable of race repre-
sents. More detailed measures of familial and social experi-
ences with medical care providers, self-care practices, deci-
sion-making styles, community attitudes to services, etc.
are needed. For example, definitions of health emphasizing
positive attitudes are more characteristic of older African
Americans than Whites, suggesting less inclination to seek
medical care for symptomatic reasons alone (Kaufman,
1996). Clearly the cultural heterogeneity of older African
Americans and Whites needs to be captured in more subtle
and specific ways and integrated into national health sur-
veys.
Second, the relatively consistent contributions of health
status, financial resources, and medical insurance to service
use suggest that in spite of the difference in sampling
frames, individual, institutional and provider resources all
play crucial roles in medical service use. Provider and insti-
tutional characteristics may be more important in medical
service use than in more discretionary service areas. A par-
allel examination of these data sets examining race differ-
ences in use of community long-term care services found
no differences in use between older African Americans and
Whites of senior centers or home-based services in any data
set (Miller et al., 1996).
In addition, institutional and provider factors may be
more important than individual choice. Pescosolido and
Kronenfeld (1995) argue cogently that models based on in-
dividual rational choice models are limited. They suggest
that models of medical care should be community-based,
involve dynamic examinations of sequences of use within
and across episodes of illness, be multimethod and multi-
level, and take into account the ways in which illness is
embedded in social life. In this context, studies of the pro-
cess of medical service use, (e.g., continuity of care, delay
in help seeking, referral patterns, and provider attitudes)
become important in defining the meaning of inequity of
access. Our findings that older African Americans use hos-
pitalization less than Whites despite health status differen-
tials, but also seem to use certain types of physician ser-
vices more often than Whites, reinforce the argument that
finer measures distinguishing health care settings and qual-
ity of services provided are urgently needed.
The limitation of individual rational choice models is
also seen in the relatively low levels of explained variance
in these analyses and other research built on the behavioral
model (Wolinsky, 1994). The fact that over 85% of the vari-
ance in use of medical services stems from unmeasured
sources argues for inclusion of supply and policy variables
in national surveys. Differences in availability of medical
services in predominately African American neighborhoods
compared to White areas, transportation patterns, cultural
interpretations of value of professional treatment, and per-
ceptions of adequacy and quality of local medical care are
only a small part of the relevant policy-related information
not gathered in current health surveys. Such variables are
especially relevant for studying race differences in access
and utilization.
The effect of insurance status and health status on medi-
cal services use was relatively consistent across data sets
and type of use. These factors are amenable to policy inter-
vention and to the experimentation in managed care and
health system reforms currently under way. Variables such
as region and living alone that were inconsistent predictors
across data sets may be less useful targets for policy inter-
vention. The lack of significance of the interaction model,
which suggested that inequalities and possible discrimina-
tion have pervasive effects, supports an emphasis on policy
interventions that influence medical care access directly.
This study was not a test of the effects of Medicare. Our
results, however, suggest that access to medical care under
Medicare guidelines has not been equalized for those in
poorer health with fewer financial resources. Policy changes
in health insurance, development of clinical guidelines for
care, and more recent health cost-containment measures
can directly influence access to care for all older persons,
irrespective of race.
