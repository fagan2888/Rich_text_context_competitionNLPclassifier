Abstract
Our aim was to examine the effects of food acculturation on Mexican Americans' (MA) diets, taking the Mexican diet as
reference. We used nationally representative samples of children (2­11 y) and female adolescents and adults (12­49 y)
from the Mexican National Nutrition Survey 1999 and NHANES 1999­2006 to compare the diets of Mexicans (n = 5678),
MA born in Mexico (MAMX) (n = 1488), MA born in the United States (MAUS) (n = 3654), and non-Hispanic white
Americans (NH-White) (n = 5473). One 24-h diet recall was used to examine the percentage consuming and percentage
energy consumed from selected food groups. Most of the food groups analyzed displayed a fairly linear increase or
decrease in percent energy/capita intake in this order: Mexican, MAMX, MAUS, NH-White. However, few significant
differences were observed among the US subpopulations, especially among MAUS and NH-Whites. Overall, compared to
Mexicans, the US subpopulations had greater intakes of saturated fat, sugar, dessert and salty snacks, pizza and French
fries, low-fat meat and fish, high-fiber bread, and low-fat milk, as well as decreased intakes of corn tortillas, low-fiber
bread, high-fat milk, and Mexican fast food. Furthermore, the patterns were similar in all age groups. Although we found a
mix of positive and negative aspects of food acculturation, the overall proportion of energy obtained from unhealthy foods
was higher among the US subpopulations. Our findings indicate that within one generation in the US, the influence of the
Mexican diet is almost lost. In addition, our results reinforce the need to discourage critical unhealthful components of the
American diet among MA. J. Nutr. 0: 1898­1906, 2011.
Introduction
In 2010, Hispanics in the United States numbered over 50.5
million, or about 1 in 6 people (1) and, by 2050, the ratio is
expected to reach 1 Hispanic in 4 people in the US. Of the
Hispanics in the US in 2002, 66.9% were of Mexican origin
(2,3). Despite higher levels of poverty, lower educational at-
tainment, and other socioeconomic disadvantages, Hispanic
immigrants do better than, or comparable to, non-Hispanic
Whites (NH-Whites)6 in overall mortality as well as cardiovas-
cular disease and malignant neoplasms mortality (4). A pro-
posed explanation for this so-called Hispanic health paradox
suggests that the original culture might be protective among new
immigrants; however, as they undergo the acculturation process
and learn or adopt aspects of the US culture, those protective
behaviors are lost (4,5). The adoption of the US diet, here called
"food acculturation," or other obesity-related behaviors seems
to be of particular importance when explaining the health
paradox. Studies using country of birth, generational status, and
length of time in the US as a proxy of acculturation have found
that the more acculturated Hispanics have higher BMI than
those who were less acculturated (6­8). However, overall, there
is a higher prevalence of obesity among Mexican Americans
(MA) than among NH-Whites (9).
The health paradox becomes more complex when we con-
sider that the original MA immigrants' culture is also undergo-
ing changes. Mexico is experiencing an epidemiological and
nutritional transition and its population is approaching the
cardio-metabolic profile observed in the US. Overweight and
obesity increased dramatically during the last 2 decades. Fat,
sugar, refined carbohydrate, and soda intake have also increased
among the Mexican population as has an array of cardiovascu-
lar problems (10­13).
Several studies have described the role of acculturation on
the MA diet. Both beneficial and deleterious changes have been
reported, but, in general, most research notes an overall

deleterious net effect on the MA diet (14­17). These studies have
compared the diets of MA in the US with different levels of
acculturation using the less acculturated group as the reference.
However, strictly speaking, all MA groups have already under-
gone at least some degree of acculturation. All are self-selected
immigrants and all have been directly exposed to the US
environment. To fill this important gap and better understand
the effects of food acculturation on the quality of the MA diet,
we used a nonacculturated group as the reference, namely, the
Mexican population.
This study used data from Mexico and the US. The foods in
each data set were linked to systematically group identical foods
in both surveys. This allowed us to compare the diets of persons
residing in Mexico with 3 subpopulations residing in the US:
Mexican Americans born in Mexico (MAMX), Mexican Amer-
icans born in the US (MAUS), and NH-White. Our aims in
comparing these 4 subpopulations with different degrees of
exposure to the US environment were, first, to identify the
beneficial or deleterious effects of adopting a US diet, using the
Mexican diet as reference, and, second, to assess the influence of
the Mexican diet relative to the influence of the American diet
on the MAMX and MAUS subpopulations. This information
provides insight into how to address and intervene in the
nutrition-related problems of the MA population. In addition,
we examined a number of key age-gender groupings, including
children of both genders, female adolescents, and adult women.
Methods
Participants. This analysis used secondary data from nationally rep-
resentative samples from both Mexico and the US. For Mexico, we used
data from the MNS 1999, conducted by the Mexican National Institute
of Public Health between October 1998 and March 1999. For this
survey, a probabilistic sample representative of urban and rural areas
was selected. A detailed description of the sampling strategy and survey
methodology was previously published (18). Due to budget restrictions,
only information for women (12­49 y old) and children (2­11 y old) was
collected and dietary information was collected from a nationally
representative subsample of the MNS 1999. For this analysis, we in-
cluded all women and children with complete dietary data.
For the US, we used data from NHANES, which includes a rep-
resentative sample of the US population of all ages. People $60 y old,
African Americans, and Hispanics are oversampled. To have an adequate
sample size of MA, we combined data for 8 y of surveys (1999­2006).
However, before doing so, we examined the differences between the 4
surveys (1999­2000, 2001­2002, 2003­2004, and 2005­2006) among
the entire population included in this analysis by age-group and found no
significant differences (P , 0.01) for our main measures of interest.
Detailed information about each survey and its sampling design has been
published elsewhere (19). For this analysis, we included women (12­49 y
old) and children (2­11 y old) and created comparison groups among
participants that identified themselves as MAMX, MAUS, and NH-
Whites. The Institutional Review Board of the National Institute in
Mexico approved data collection and provided expedited approval for
use of these secondary data for this article. For NHANES, written
informed consent was obtained from all participants; by utilizing
secondary NAHNES data, we were exempt from institutional review
board monitoring for this paper.
Dietary intake, food composition tables, and food groups. Dietary
intake analysis was based on a single 24-h dietary recall from each
survey, whereby participants reported all foods and beverages consumed
during the previous day. For MNS 1999, one 24-h recall was performed
at the household of the participant. Trained personnel applied the
questionnaires and converted each reported preparation into grams or
milliliters of individual foods; however, no standardized probing method
(i.e. 5-pass method) was used in this survey. For NHANES, the 24-h
recalls were conducted in English or Spanish by dietary interviewers with
a computer-assisted automated data collection system. Beginning in
2002, the collection system changed to a multiple 5-pass method, which
covers essentially the same questions used in 1999­2001 but in a slightly
different order (20,21). In addition, after 2002, participants were asked
to complete a second 24-h dietary recall interview by telephone. To
maintain consistency among all surveys, we included only the first 24-h
recall from each in this analysis.
The NHANES nutrient intake was estimated using the USDA
FNDDS, which is based on the USDA-SR. The main differences between
the databases are that the FNDDS does not have missing values and
includes a larger variety of portion sizes and food mixtures. The
NHANES 1999­2000 survey used a different food composition table
that does not include sugar, the USDA 1994­1998 Survey Nutrient Data
Base (22); therefore, for these years, we used FNDDS 1.0 (NHANES
2001­2002). Eighty-one foods reported by this sample were not included
in FNDDS 1.0. For these foods, the original food composition table was
used and sugar content was imputed based on the carbohydrate:sugar
ratios of similar foods.
MNS 1999 originally used a comprehensive nutrient composition
database compiled from diverse references by the Nutrition and Health
Research Center, National Institute of Public Health. This compilation
was based on the USDA-SR for one-half of the foods (348 of 680 foods
reported in our sample). For the present analysis, we revised this
database to make it more comparable to the one used in NHANES. After
an exhaustive review, food-by-food, we found that FNDDS was ap-
propriate for 375 of the foods, because the energy content and/or the
description of the food were similar in both food composition tables. We
continued to use the initial compilation's source for the rest of the foods,
which was the USDA-SR for 105 foods. The revised database still had 93
foods with sugar content missing, so we imputed these values based on
the carbohydrate:sugar ratios of similar foods.
Diet comparisons were based on a food grouping system developed at
The University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (23). By using this system,
we could summarize intake in a nutritionally and behaviorally mean-
ingful way. The system was developed by further disaggregating the
major food groups of the USDA by fat and fiber content. The version we
used had 107 food groups and, for this study, we added 3 more groups:
corn tortillas (including other corn products), wheat tortillas, and atole
(corn- or other cereal-based Mexican beverages). We first performed the
analysis using all groups. Then, we focused only on the food groups that
were captured well by both surveys. In the MNS 1999, most of the intake
was reported by ingredient and not by the food as prepared, whereas, in
the NHANES, reporting the food as prepared was more common.
Therefore, we observed, e.g., a higher consumption of oils, sugar, and
flour and a lower consumption of hamburgers or other mixed dishes in
the MNS 1999 compared to the NHANES. Because this discrepancy
results from the way diet is reported and not from actual intake
differences, we did not present information on these groups.
For adult and adolescent women, we wanted to capture the intake of
sugar-sweetened beverages like coffee, tea, and fruit drinks. So, in both
surveys, we aggregated the beverage ingredients that were recorded
separately into a single food group. For example, if coffee, milk, and
sugar were recorded as part of a single preparation, we combined that
information into a single group called "coffee with milk and sugar." We
also aggregated some foods groups that had similar nutritional or
behavioral values. In addition, we do not present the food groups that
comprised ,1% of the total energy intake per capita or food groups with
noncaloric items consumed by ,5% of the participants in either
subpopulation.
Statistical analysis. Both the MNS 1999 and NHANES are complex
sample surveys; therefore, we analyzed each of them separately using the
appropriate weighted survey commands to account for the study designs
and sampling methods. Diets can differ between subpopulations with
respect to the proportion of people consuming a specific food group and/
or the amount of that food group each person consumes. Therefore, for
examination of dietary data patterns, we focused on 3 measures of a food
group's intake: the percentage consuming each food group (percent

consuming); the mean percentage of total energy from that food/
beverage group among consumers (percent energy/consumers); and, for
the total sample, the mean percentage of total energy per capita (percent
energy/capita). The last is a summary of the first 2, because it is obtained
by multiplying percent consuming by the percent energy/consumers.
Data are presented as means or percent 6 SEM.
Age standardization based on census 2000 population data (10-y
group distribution) was used for all adult women. Statistical compar-
isons were performed with a z-test using the SE computed for each mean
or proportion with survey commands, as previously suggested (24). In
this case, using the sample variance instead of the population variance
was a fair approximation because of our sample sizes. To confirm this,
we also computed the t test when possible; e.g., when comparing groups
coming from the same survey (NHANES), both the z-test and the t test
were concordant when identifying significant results (though results
from t test are not shown). We adjusted the P-value for multiple
comparisons with Bonferroni correction. P , 0.01 was considered
significant. All analyses were conducted in Stata 11.1 (StataCorp).
Results
Demographics. A few important differences in demographic
characteristics existed (Table 1). NH-White adult women were
slightly older compared to all other subpopulations (P , 0.01).
The proportion of adult women with less than a high school
education was higher in the Mexican and MAMX subpopula-
tions compared to the MAUS and NH-Whites. Among children
(7­11 y old), the proportion of overweight or obese individuals
(BMI for age $85th percentile) (25) was significantly lower in
the Mexicans compared to all other subpopulations. However,
among adult women, the proportion was significantly lower for
NH-Whites compared to all other subpopulations.
Mexican vs. US diets: the positive and negative effects of
food acculturation. Total energy intake was lower in Mexicans
of all ages than in all other subpopulations (P , 0.01) (Table 1),
whereas there were no significant differences among the US
subpopulations. Consequently, we present all dietary results as a
percentage of energy/day (percent energy). Based on nutrients,
Mexicans had a more suitable dietary profile, with a lower
proportion of energy from saturated fat and sugar compared to
all other subpopulations (P , 0.01).
With respect to beverages, among adult women, we observed
a mix of positive and negative effects of acculturation to the US
diet. The proportion of participants consuming coffee without
sugar was higher among Mexicans compared to all others,
whereas the proportion that consumed coffee with milk and
sugar and tea with sugar was higher in the US subpopulations
than in Mexicans. (Fig. 1; Supplemental Table 4). In the case of
sodas, the proportion that consumed regular soda was signifi-
cantly higher among MAMX and MAUS compared to Mexi-
cans, and the proportion consuming diet sodas was significantly
higher among MAUS and NH-White adult women compared to
Mexicans and MAMX.
Although in all subpopulations a higher proportion preferred
high-fat milk, a benefit of food acculturation was that the ratio
of adult women drinking high-fat milk to those drinking low-fat
milk was lower in the US subpopulations (139.4 among
Mexicans, 5.2 among MAMX, 3.9 among MAUS, and 1.1
among NH-Whites). The consumption of milk with chocolate
did not differ, and the proportion of adult women consuming
atole was higher in the Mexican population compared to all
other subpopulations (P , 0.01).
Similar patterns across subpopulations were found in female
adolescents and children (Supplemental Tables 1­3). As ex-
pected, a generally lower proportion of adolescents and children
consumed coffee and tea and a higher proportion consumed
milk and soda compared to adult women. Remarkably, consid-
erably more Mexican children consumed coffee (30% of 7­11 y
olds; 24% of 2­6 y olds) compared to US children (1­6%).
With respect to food groups, we also noticed a mix of positive
and negative adoptions (Table 2). Considering only food groups
with large differences in percent energy/capita ($4% difference
between at least 2 subpopulations) among adult women (Fig. 2),
the positive aspects of acculturation included a higher intake of
low-fat meat and fish and high-fiber bread and a lower intake of
low-fiber bread and Mexican fast food among the US subpopu-
lations compared to Mexicans. On the negative side of accultur-
ation to the US diet, we observed that consumption of dessert and
salty snacks as well as pizza and French fries was higher among
the US subpopulations. Another important difference was that
Mexicans had a remarkably greater consumption of corn tortillas.
The effects of acculturation in terms of percent energy/capita
can be due to a difference in percent consuming, percent energy/
consumers, or both. In the case of medium- and high-fat meat
and eggs, nuts and seeds, ready-to-eat cereal, Mexican fast food,
and pizza and French fries, the percent energy/consumers was
basically the same across all 4 subpopulations (P . 0.01)
(Supplemental Table 4). This means that differences in percent
energy/capita were due to differences in percent consuming. On
the contrary, in the case of low-fiber bread, corn tortillas, and
dessert and salty snacks, both the percent consuming and
percent energy/consumers differed among subpopulations in the
same direction as percent energy/capita. This means that, e.g.,
the higher percent energy/capita in corn tortilla consumption
observed among Mexicans was due to both a higher percent
consuming and a higher percent energy/consumers.
The general patterns in adult women were fairly similar to
those among female adolescents and children. Nevertheless, the
intakes (percent energy/capita) of ready-to-eat cereal, dessert
and salty snacks, pizza, and French fries were higher in female
adolescents and children compared to adult women; also, the
intake of corn tortillas was lower in children 2­6 y old than in
adult women (Supplemental Tables 1­4).
When we aggregated many food groups into healthy and
unhealthy options (Fig. 3), we saw that the percent energy/capita
of healthy foods was significantly higher among Mexicans
compared to all other subpopulations if we included tortillas in
this category. However, if we did not include tortillas as a
healthy item, then the percent energy/capita of healthy foods
was lower or similar among Mexicans compared to the US
subpopulations. In the case of unhealthy foods, the percent
energy/capita generally increased as we moved from Mexicans
to NH-Whites. In addition, unhealthy foods provided a higher
proportion of energy intake for children and female adolescents
(41­59%) than for adult women (36­46%).
The influence of the Mexican diet on the MA population.
When we ordered the data by degree of exposure to the US
environment (Mexican, MAMX, MAUS, and NH-White), we
noticed in most of the food groups and in the healthy or
unhealthy categories, a linear pattern between the percent
energy/capita and the subpopulation's degree of US exposure
(Supplemental Tables 1­4; Fig. 2). This may reflect a decrease in
the influence of the Mexican diet within MA generations.
Important exceptions to this linear pattern were fruits and
vegetables and fruit juices, in which MAMX had a significantly
higher intake compared to all other subpopulations, especially
among adult women.

Another important finding was that the differences among
subpopulations were mainly between Mexicans and all of the US
subpopulations. We saw some differences between MAMX and
MAUS or between MAMX and NH-Whites, but we did not find
a difference $5% in percent energy/capita when we compared
the MAUS to the NH-White subpopulation. This could be an
indication that the influence of the Mexican diet relative to that
of the American diet was almost absent in the MAUS subpop-
ulation. In addition, for children and female adolescents, the
influence of the Mexican diet might be even lower among the
MAMX subpopulation. There were fewer significant differences
when we compared MAMX to MAUS among children and
female adolescents than among adult women. Also, fewer
significant differences across all subpopulations were found
among children 2­6 y old compared to other age groups when
aggregating foods into healthy or unhealthy options.

Discussion
By comparing not only US subpopulations of MA (MAMX,
MAUS) but also Mexicans and NH-Whites, we saw the effects of
exposure to the US environment and the influence of the
Mexican diet relative to the American diet on MA food intake.
Our main finding was that with food acculturation comes a mix
of beneficial and deleterious diet adoptions. The beneficial
dietary aspects we found included increased intake of low-fat
meat and fish, high-fiber bread, and low-fat milk and decreased
consumption of low-fiber bread, high-fat milk, and Mexican fast
food. The deleterious aspects we found in our comparison
included increased intake of saturated fat, sugar, dessert and
salty snacks, pizza, and French fries. Overall, when we aggre-
gated foods into healthy or unhealthy categories, the percent
energy/capita of unhealthy foods was higher among the US
subpopulations. The results for the healthy category depended
on how tortillas were classified. The percent energy/capita of
healthy foods was highest in Mexicans, relative to the US
subpopulations, when tortillas were included and lower or
similar in Mexicans when tortillas were excluded.
The largest difference was the much lower consumption of
corn tortillas among MA compared to Mexicans. Corn tortillas
are a low-fat, low-sodium, and high-fiber food that could be
considered as healthy and, therefore, the lower intake of this
food among MA may be classified as a negative effect of food
acculturation. However, minimal research has focused on the
healthfulness of tortillas. About 25% of the energy per capita
among Mexicans came from corn tortillas; thus, if a reduction in
tortilla intake promotes the inclusion of more varied and
healthier foods in the diet, which we cannot determine, this
reduction might be viewed as beneficial.
The main contribution of this study is that it included the
diets of Mexican residents of ages comparable to the ages of the
US subpopulations included. This allowed a clearer identifica-
tion of the reasons for the similarities and differences between
foreign-born and US-born MA. We could assess if these differ-
ences are related to influences of Mexican origin or to other
unique features of these subpopulations. For most of the food
groups, we found a fairly linear pattern between the percent
energy/capita and the degree of exposure to the US environment.
This means that the differences between MAMX and MAUS
subpopulations could be seen as steps moving from the Mexican
to the American diet. However, for some food groups, notably
fruits and vegetables, fruit juices, and fruit drinks, the MAMX
subpopulation had the highest percent energy/capita intake
among adult women.
Fruit and vegetable intake has been repeatedly reported as
higher among the MAMX subpopulation or first-generation
Hispanics compared to the MAUS or second-generation His-
panics (8,14,15,26,27). Yet our results indicate that the Mexican
diet does not include a high intake of fruits and vegetables. A
study that retrospectively evaluated the diets of women of
Mexican descent living in California prior to and after their
migration found that the consumption of vegetables and fruit
juices increased after migration (28). The authors noted that, in a
traditional Mexican diet, vegetables were used mainly as ingre-
dients in the preparation of soups, rice, pasta, and meat, whereas
salads and vegetable side dishes that were less common in Mexico
were consumed more frequently after immigration to the US. This
may explain why, in our results, the MAMX adult subpopulation
consumed more fruits and vegetables than the Mexicans. How-
ever, it remains unclear why the MAMX subpopulation has a
higher intake of fruits and vegetables compared to the MAUS
subpopulation in this and previous studies.
By adding NH-Whites to our comparison, we were able to put
into perspective the importance of the Mexican influence on MA
populations. We can see that the diets of MAMX and MAUS had
more in common with the American diet than with the Mexican

diet. This was especially true for the diets of the MAUS
subpopulation, which showed very few significant differences
from that of the NH-White subpopulation. Moreover, the differ-
ences seemed to be even fewer among children and female ado-
lescents. Also, relative to the differences between the MAMX and
the Mexican diet, the differences between MAMX and MAUS
seemed small; perhaps a stratification of MAMX by length of time
in the US could enlarge the differences in this study.
To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has
simultaneously compared Mexican and MA diets with the
objective of assessing food acculturation. One earlier study
examined household food insecurity among 5-y-old children of
Mexican descent living in migrant communities in California
and Mexico. The authors did not directly compare the Mexican
and Californian children's diets due to slight differences in the
FFQ used in each country. Nevertheless, that study notes a more
frequent intake of fruits, dairy, sweetened beverages, and fast
foods and a less frequent intake of tortillas among children living
in California compared to those living in Mexico (29). Although
we did not use the exact same food groups or dietary measures,
our results are in general consistent with this previous finding.
Numerous studies have compared the diets of Hispanics with
different degrees of acculturation (30,31). Some of the studies
that used place of birth as a proxy for acculturation to compare
the diets of populations of Mexican descent reported results
similar to ours for the common food groups studied. In addition
to fruits and vegetables and fruit and vegetable juices mentioned
above, previous studies agreed that Mexican-born participants
exhibited higher intakes of corn tortillas (15,26), legumes
(8,14,15,26), and high-fat milk (8,14) and lower intakes of
salty snacks (14,15), desserts (14), fast food (8,14), and diet
sodas (26) compared to US-born participants.
The higher overall percentage of energy per capita coming
from unhealthy foods found among MAUS compared to
MAMX might help explain why some studies have found higher
BMI in the more acculturated MA than in those less acculturated
(6­8). However, it is well known that NH-Whites have a lower
prevalence of obesity compared to MA (9) and in this study we
also found that the intake of unhealthy foods was similar or
slightly higher among NH-Whites than among MA. This
supports that the cause of obesity among MA is complex and
that other factors might interact with the diet.

Although the current study provided good insight regarding
how the country of birth influences food acculturation in MA
populations, we need to keep in mind that these results described
a scenario representative of roughly a decade ago. Unfortu-
nately, for our aims, the MNS 1999 used here is the most recent
nationally representative survey in Mexico that collected detailed
FIGURE 2 Percentage energy per capita from food groups with a difference of at least $4% among any 2 subpopulations in Mexican (MNS
1999), MA, and NH-White (NHANES 1999-2006) adult women. n = 1978 (Mexican), 802 (MAMX), 486 (MAUS), or 2297 (NH-White). Percentages

data with a 24-h dietary recall instrument comparable to that
used by NHANES. A more recent national survey in Mexico in
2006 (32) used a 1-wk FFQ and therefore was not comparable
to the methodology used in NHANES. Many ongoing changes
in both Mexico and the US might affect the differences among
the subpopulations in this study. For one, Mexico is undergo-
ing a nutrition transition. A significant increase in energy from
beverages was reported in Mexican preschoolers and school-age
children between 1999 and 2006 (13). Energy from soft drinks,
sweetened juices, and sugared coffee more than doubled in
adolescents between 1999 and 2006 and it tripled in adult
women in that time period (33). Based on the Mexican
Household Income and Expenditure Surveys, the percentage of
Mexican households purchasing soda increased from 57% in
1998 to 61% in 2006 (33). In addition, the intake of corn
tortillas by Mexicans decreased from 275 g/capita in 2000 to
between 180 and 190 g in 2009 (34). Based on these data, we
could hypothesize that Mexicans, due to their country's geo-
graphical proximity and highly influenced relationship with the
US, could be approximating the dietary profiles of the MA
described in this study.
Changes in the US may also influence the food acculturation
process. It has been suggested that, in areas of high Latino
density, acculturation could be expected to occur in the opposite
direction; i.e. non-Hispanic Americans are becoming accultur-
ated into the Latino culture (31). Modifications in the US food
supply and increased availability of Mexican ingredients and
foods might also help MA preserve their original diets. The
differences among NH-Whites, MA, and Mexican diets that
exist now and in the near future can only be explored as new
adequate data become available.
Our results should be viewed with caution in the sense that
we compared data obtained from 2 different surveys. Even
though both countries used 24-h dietary recalls, some evident
and nonevident survey differences might affect the results. An
important evident difference was that, in Mexico, most of the
intake was reported by ingredient, whereas in the US, a larger
proportion was reported as the final prepared food. Although we
made an effort to combine the ingredients of key foods into a
single food group, like beverages, and to report only food groups
that were captured well by both surveys, we still might have
missed some crucial information. Moreover, because the 24-h
methodology in Mexico did not include a 5-pass or similar
probing method, we cannot reject the possibility that the degree
of underreporting or differential reporting of healthy or un-
healthy foods was different in the 2 surveys.
Another limitation of this study is that it does not include
information on male adolescents and adults or on older adults of
either gender. This fact severely limits the general picture we can
get of how food acculturation affects the diets of all age and
gender groups.
We also acknowledge that acculturation is a complex
phenomenon that cannot be quantified by a simple static proxy
indicator like birthplace. As has been suggested, the accultura-
tion process is complex and multidimensional. Hispanics may
become assimilated, integrated, segregated, or marginalized to
the American mainstream culture (31). Our intention in this
study was therefore to use birthplace as a proxy of exposure to
the US environment rather than an overall measure of the degree
of acculturation. We think that by assessing the Mexican and US
influences on the diets of MA born in Mexico and those born in
the US, we are, indeed, approaching a better understanding of
the food acculturation process of these subpopulations with
different degrees of exposure to the US environment.
In sum, our results indicate that Mexicans in 1999 appeared
to have eaten a healthier diet than US subpopulations between
1999 and 2006 and that, as the level of exposure to the US
environment increased, the MA diet shifted toward an un-
healthier one. MAMX who had adopted many aspects of the US
diet but still preserved many from their original Mexican culture
appeared to have healthier diets than MAUS. In addition, the
differences between the MAUS and NH-White subpopulations
were minimal, suggesting that the food acculturation process
might be almost completed within one generation among the
MA population. These results strengthen our understanding of
acculturation to the American food environment among MA
and they reinforce the need to discourage critical unhealthful
components of the American diet among MA.
