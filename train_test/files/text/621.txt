ABSTRACT
The objective of this article was to estimate the prevalence of Paget's disease of bone in the United States from a
statistically derived sample of the general population. Pelvic radiographs obtained in the First National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-I) were reviewed for the presence of Paget's disease. Age, sex,
and geographic distribution of Paget's disease of the pelvic region were determined. The overall prevalence of
Paget's disease in the United States was estimated. Pelvic Paget's disease is estimated to be present in 0.71 
0.18% of the radiographs of the general population. The disease was higher in frequency in people who were in
the older decades of life with the highest prevalence of 2.32  0.54% in the 65- to 74-year-old people. There is a
slight male predominance in the 45- to 74-year age group. The regional distribution suggests the highest
prevalence in the Northeast (1.48  0.52%) with the lowest prevalence in the South (0.260.25%). The
prevalence was equal in white people and black people. An estimate of the overall prevalence of Paget's disease
in the United States was at least 1% and perhaps as much as 2% of the general population with near equal sex
distribution and the highest prevalence in the northeastern United States. (J Bone Miner Res 2000;15:461­465)

INTRODUCTION
PAGET'S DISEASE OF bone has become a recognized
clinical syndrome that is most often asymptomatic but
can cause a variety of medical complications that potentially
result in considerable morbidity and reduced quality of
life.(1­3) Despite the impact of this disease on the population
and the health care system, there are only few, mostly
isolated hospital-based studies, that address the prevalence
of Paget's disease of bone in the United States and the true
prevalence of Paget's disease in the United States (or
elsewhere) remains unknown.
The First National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES-I) was a program conducted by the
United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare
in the United States from 1971 to 1975.(4) The sampling
technique was designed to examine a representative sample
of noninstitutionalized civilians from the general population.
Historical information, physical examination, laboratory
tests, and radiographs were collected. The age range of the
population examined was from 18 to 79 years. Of the
participants, all men age 25­74 and all women age 50­74
had radiographs of the pelvis performed. This information
has been used to estimate the prevalence of osteoarthritis of
the knees, hips, and sacroiliac joints and examination factors
associated with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip.(4­7)
Although there was a review of the pelvic radiographs for
arthritis, the presence of Paget's disease of bone was not
recorded.(4) We reviewed radiographs of the pelvic region
obtained at the time of the NHANES-I study in order to
estimate the prevalence of Paget's disease in the United
States.

METHODS
Review of radiographs
The National Center for Health Statistics provided access
to 3936 of the 4897 (80.4%) anteroposterior radiographs of
the pelvic region obtained in the NHANES-I survey. Miss-
ing films were distributed randomly through the regional
batches. Radiographs were repackaged from storage at the
National Center for Health Statistics (Bethesda, MD, U.S.A.)
and coded and grouped by geographic area of the country.
They were then shipped to the radiology department of the
University of Texas, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Hous-
ton, Texas with the coordination and cooperation of the
National Center for Health Statistics.
Pelvic radiographs were sequentially mounted on 2 multi-
view X-ray view boxes, each containing 150 films. Readings
of the radiographs were performed simultaneously by 2
readers (R.A. and W.M.) over a 3-day period. The film
number and any positive findings were recorded in detail.
All positive X-rays were reviewed a second time by both
readers before removal of the films from the view boxes. A
third review was conducted at a later date by one of the
readers (W.M.). Interpretive discrepancies were discussed at
the end of each reading session and an adjudicated reading
was recorded.
The radiographs were reviewed for the presence of
Paget's disease. It was hypothesized that there would be
approximately 50 radiographs with Paget's disease. The
finding of Paget's disease on the pelvic radiograph was
based on the following characteristic radiographic appear-
ance(8):
 Expansion of bone size
 Thickened, disorganized trabeculae
 Thickened, expanded cortex
 Osteosclerosis
 Deformity
The ilia were examined for cortical and trabecular involve-
ment. The ileopectineal line was examined for thickening
and sclerosis (``Brim sign''). The pubis was examined for
enlargement, deformity, or coarse trabeculation. The pelvis
was examined for axial migration giving the pelvic brim a
triangular appearance or ``triradiate'' deformity with or
without protrusio acetabuli. The proximal femora and sev-
eral lumbar vertebrae were variably included in the radio-
graphs. The presence of Paget's disease at these sites was
recorded similarly. Hence, distribution of disease (ilium,
ischium, pubis, sacrum, adjacent lumbar vertebrae, femoral
heads, and proximal femoral shafts), degree of change (1
to 4), type of change (i.e., sclerotic or lytic), and deformity
(protrusio acetabuli, triangulation of the pelvic brim, and
bowed femora) were recorded.
When readings were completed, radiographs were repack-
aged and returned to the National Center for Health Statis-
tics in Washington, D.C. The National Center for Health
Statistics then supplied the conversion from the subject's
radiographic numbers to their subject's unique identifier
number for correlation with the data tapes.
Data from the readings of pelvic radiographs for Paget's
disease already entered by the readers were collated in a data
file by X-ray number. The readings were merged into a data
file containing the subject's unique identifier and any other
relevant information drawn from the data tapes. The preva-
lence of Paget's disease of the pelvic region in the United
States was estimated using the complex sample weights
provided by the National Center for Health Statistics
(Bethesda, MD, U.S.A.).(9)
The descriptive epidemiology estimated the prevalence of
Paget's disease by age in 10-year age groups: 25­34, 35­44,
45­54, 55­64, and 65­74, gender, race (white vs. nonwhite),
and geographic location with 95% confidence intervals from
the available data.
Analyses were conducted at Stanford University by one of
the investigators (B.A.D.) using published programs in the
Statistical Analysis System (Version 6, SAS Institute, Cary,
N.C., U.S.A.).
RESULTS
Thirty-one radiographs showed Paget's disease of bone
(Table 1). Pelvic Paget's disease was present in 27 (87%)
radiographs. Of those without pelvic involvement, one had
Paget's disease in the fourth lumbar vertebra and the
proximal left femur, one had proximal left femoral involve-
ment, one had the fifth lumbar vertebra involved, and one
had the second lumbar vertebra involved. Radiographically,
unilateral pelvic involvement was present in 12 of the 27
(44%) of those with pelvic Paget's disease. All radiographic
lesions were predominantly blastic in nature. The sacroiliac

joints were fused in one and three had osteoarthritis of the
hip adjacent to the Paget's disease.
The crude prevalence of Paget's disease on the radio-
graphs was 31 of 3936 (0.79%) and the adjusted prevalence
rate was 0.71  0.18% (standard deviation). By gender, in
the 45- to 74-year age groups, there were 19 men and 12
women affected for an adjusted prevalence rate of 1.16 
0.33% for men and 1.00  0.33% for women (ratio of men
to women, 1.2:1) (Table 2). The age-adjusted prevalence for
men drops to 0.56 when the 45- to 54-year-old men are
included (there was no study of a comparable age group for
women). Paget's disease was present in 27 of 3423 white
people and 4 of 475 black people for an adjusted prevalence
rate of 0.72  0.19% for whites and 0.73  0.58% for
blacks. There were no cases of Paget's disease among the 38
people who were Asian or of other origin.
The prevalence of Paget's disease by age is shown in
Table 2. Prevalence rates increased with age, peaking in
those over age 65 with an age-specific­adjusted prevalence
rate of 2.3%. Only one subject below the age 45 years had
radiographic evidence of Paget's disease.
The region of the United States with the highest preva-
lence of Paget's disease was the Northeast at 1.48% with the
lowest prevalence in the South with a prevalence of 0.26%
(Table 3).
DISCUSSION
By examining the pelvic radiographs from the NHANES-I
study, we are able to estimate the prevalence of Paget's
disease in the pelvic region to be 0.71  0.18% in the
general population. The ratio of men to women was 1.2:1;
the prevalence in black people was the same as in white
people. In addition, Paget's disease was most common in the
northeastern United States and least common in the South.

PREVALENCE OF PELVIC PAGET'S DISEASE
The prevalence increased with age with the highest preva-
lence was in those over 65 years of age.
There have been no similar national studies on the
prevalence of Paget's disease of bone. Prior local studies in
the United States, based on imaging techniques, have
prevalence estimates of 0­3.9% (Table 4).(10­12) Most prior
studies in Europe have been based on pelvic region radio-
graphs and have prevalence estimates ranging from 0.4% to
8.3%.(13­16,18­23) The numbers from our study approximate
the recent report by Cooper et al., but the two sets of
data were collected on separate populations two decades
apart.(15)
Because the only areas of the body that are frequently
affected by Paget's disease that were examined in the
NHANES-I radiographs were the pelvis and surrounding
tissues, and because Paget's disease may affect any part of
the skeleton, it is likely that not all cases of Paget's disease
were detected in this review. Some small series place the
frequency of pelvic Paget's disease at 40­91% of patients
with Paget's disease.(2,8,22,25,26) In the largest series, the
pelvis was involved in 76% of 1864 patients with Paget's
disease.(26) If one estimates the overall prevalence of Paget's
disease by extension from the frequency of pelvic involve-
ment according to this latter study and applies this to the
results from the NHANES-I the prevalence of Paget's
disease in the United States could be estimated to be 1.04%
of the general population or approximately 2.5 million
people. A more liberal lower limit of pelvic frequency (i.e.,
pelvis involved in 40% of those with Paget's disease) would
increase the estimate of population prevalence to 1.98% of
the general population or approximately 5 million people.
Cooper estimated the prevalence in the United Kingdom to
be 262,000 people.(15) Consistent with other studies, there
was a very slight predominance of men in this popula-
tion.(2,15)
As in all prior studies, we found an increasing prevalence
of Paget's disease of bone in people in the older decades of
life. There are several potential interpretations of this data:
(1) Paget's disease may not develop until an older age (this
could encompass both a genetic and an infectious etiology);
(2) there may be a lag time in the development of disease, so
it is only expressed in later life; (3) Paget's disease is
protective and those with Paget's disease live longer; and (4)
there may be a decreasing incidence of Paget's disease in the
general population. The latter is suggested by recent stud-
ies.(15,27)
The regional distribution of Paget's disease found in this
review of the NHANES-I data reinforces the generally
accepted clinical impression and results of regional hospital-
based studies that Paget's disease is most common in the
northeastern United States and uncommon in the southern
United States.(19,20) The influence of race and ethnicity on
this regional distribution is unknown.
Most studies have suggested a low prevalence of Paget's
disease in black people.(2,10) The finding of an equal
prevalence in the NHANES-I data is unexplained. It is
possible that prior studies were biased because of inadequate
sampling of black people.
Limitations of this study include the following: (1) 19.8%
of the radiographs were not available for review and the
influence on the data is unknown, (2) the true frequency of
pelvic regional involvement as a reflection of the presence of
Paget's disease of bone is not known and a conservative
estimate was used, (3) the cohort population was not fully
examined for Paget's disease because all bones of the
skeleton were not examined radiographically or by radionu-
clide bone scan, (4) the presence of pelvic Paget's disease is
not 100% detectable by radiographs, (5) extrapolation of the
small numbers derived from NHANES-I to the entire
population may not be accurate, and (6) there was no

In summary, our review of pelvic region radiographs from
the NHANES-I cohort suggests that Paget's disease in the
United States has an estimated prevalence of at least 1%,
increases with age, has a slight male predominance, and is
most common in the northeastern United States.
