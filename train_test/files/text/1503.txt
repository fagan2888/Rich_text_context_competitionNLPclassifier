ABSTRACT
Background: Little is known about the distributions of percentage
body fat (PBF), total body fat (TBF), and fat-free mass (FFM) in the
adult population in the United States.
Objectives: We sought to estimate the means and percentile cutoffs
of PBF, TBF, and FFM and to assess the differences by sex, age,
race-ethnicity, and body mass index in US adults.
Design: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES), which were collected during the 6-y period
from 1999 to 2004 and comprise a large nationally representative
sample of the US population, were analyzed (n = 6559 men and
6507 nonpregnant women). TBF and FFM were measured by using
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. PBF was calculated as TBF di-
vided by total mass multiplied by 100.
Results: There were large differences between men and women in
unadjusted mean PBF (28.1% compared with 40.0%, P , 0.001),
TBF (25.4 compared with 30.8 kg, P , 0.001), and FFM (62.3
compared with 44.0 kg, P , 0.001); the sex differences persisted
across all body mass index categories after adjustment for age and
race-ethnicity (all P , 0.001). The common percentile cutoffs of
PBF, TBF, and FFM were estimated by sex, race-ethnicity, and age
groups. Equations for the estimation of PBF (R2 = 0.85), TBF (R2 =
0.94), and FFM (R2 = 0.94) according to demographic character-
istics and simple anthropometric measures were generated.
Conclusion: The estimates of means and percentile cutoffs for PBF,
TBF, and FFM, on the basis of NHANES 199922004 dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry data, provide a reference in the US adult
population. Am J Clin Nutr 2009;90:1457­65.
INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of overall obesity as measured by body mass
index (BMI) has increased in the United States (1). Excess body
fat is associated with increased cardiometabolic risks in the
general population and in people with type 2 diabetes (2­4). BMI,
calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared, has been
used commonly to assess overall obesity in clinical settings and
public health surveys. However, because BMI does not measure
body fat directly and poorly distinguishes between fat mass and
lean or bone mass, the use of BMI as an index of body fat for
a person may be inaccurate.
Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is one of the most
widely accepted methods to directly assess total and regional
body fat and fat-free mass (FFM), which includes lean soft issues
and bone mineral (5). This technique is noninvasive and easily
applicable to persons with and without diseases, and it yields
accurate and reliable results (6). Percentage body fat (PBF),
which is calculated as total body fat (TBF) divided by total mass
multiplied by 100, is a direct measure of a person's relative body
fat. There exist significant differences in body fat across sex, age,
and race-ethnicity (7).
Previous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) studies have mainly assessed the distributions of
anthropometric data (ie, weight, height, waist circumference, and
skinfold thickness) and used BMI as an approximate index for
relative body fat. Although bioelectrical impedance analysis
(BIA) was used to estimate body composition in the United States
in the third NHANES (1988­1994) (8), estimates based on BIA
may be inaccurate because it is not a direct method for the as-
sessment of body composition (9, 10). Moreover, estimates of the
percentile cutoffs of body composition may provide a reference
for the US population. To the best of our knowledge, there are no
population-based quantitative estimates of means and percentile
cutoffs of directly measured PBF, TBF, and FFM with DXA
among adults in the United States thus far. The objectives of this
study were 1) to analyze the DXA data from the NHANES
1999­2004 and assess differences in the means of PBF, TBF,
and FFM by sex, age, race-ethnicity, and BMI and 2) to estimate
sex-, age-, and race-ethnicity­specific percentile cutoffs of PBF,
TBF, and FFM.
METHODS
Study design and population
In NHANES 1999­2004, a cross-sectional sample was
recruited through the use of a complex, stratified, multistage
probability design to represent the noninstitutionalized civilian
US population. People aged 60 y, non-Hispanic blacks, and
Mexican Americans were oversampled to ensure accurate esti-

approval by the National Center for Health Statistics In-
stitutional Review Board and Research Ethics Review Board
and included written informed consent from each participant.
After they were interviewed at home, participants were invited
to attend the mobile examination center, where they were ex-
amined. Details about the plan and operation of the survey have
been published (11). In the present study, we limited the anal-
yses to men and nonpregnant women aged 20 y who had
complete or imputed data on PBF, TBF, and FFM (n = 13,066).
The final sample represents adults aged 20 y in the United
States.
DXA
Detailed descriptions about the DXA data have been published
(12, 13). In brief, whole-body DXA scans were administered in
the NHANES mobile examination center to eligible participants
during the 6-y period from 1999 to 2004. The participants with
the following conditions were excluded from the DXA exami-
nation: 1) pregnancy assured by positive urine pregnancy test
and/or by self-report at the time of the DXA examination, 2)
self-reported history of radiographic contrast material (barium)
use in past 7 d, 3) self-reported nuclear medicine studies in the
past 3 d, and 4) self-reported weight (.300 lb or 136 kg) or
height (.6 ft 5 in or 196 cm) in excess of the DXA table limit.
The DXA scans provided bone and soft tissue measurements for
the total body and regions (both arms and both legs, the trunk,
and the head), including total mass (g), bone mineral content (g),
bone area (cm2), bone mineral density (g/cm2), fat mass (g), and
lean mass (g). Total PBF was calculated as TBF mass divided by
total mass · 100.
Whole-body DXA scans were acquired with the use of
a Hologic QDR-4500A fan-beam densitometer (Hologic Inc,
Bedford, MA) with the Hologic DOC software (version 8.26:a3).
The participants wore paper gowns and were in a supine position
on the tabletop with their feet in a neutral position and hands flat
by their sides. The DXA examinations were administered by
certified radiology technologists. The participants were scanned
with an X-ray source that used fan-beam scan geometry. The
radiation exposure from DXA is extremely low (,10 lSv).
Hologic Discovery software (version 12.1) was used to analyze
the scans.
Quality assurance and quality control of DXA scans
A high-level quality control was maintained during the entire
process of the DXA data collection and scan analysis. Staff from
the National Center for Health Statistics and the NHANES data
collection contractors monitored the acquisition performance of
radiology technologists by in-person observations in the field.
The technologists were trained annually to reinforce correct
techniques and appropriate protocol. In addition, technologist
performance codes were recorded and tracked by the NHANES
quality control center at the Department of Radiology of the
University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Each participant
and phantom scan was reviewed and analyzed by the UCSF with
the use of standard radiologic techniques and study-specific
protocols developed for NHANES. Expert review was conducted
by the UCSF on all analyzed participant scans to verify the
accuracy and consistency of the results.
Multiple imputations
Because the validity of the DXA data were influenced by age,
weight, and height, invalid and missing data could not be con-
sidered a random subset of the original sample. To avoid bias due
to nonrandom missing data, multiple imputations of the DXA
data were performed. With the exception of pregnant women and
those with amputations other than fingers or toes, all participants
with invalid or missing data were included in the multiple im-
putation process.
SAS-callable imputation and variance estimation software
(IVEware), developed by the Survey Methodology Program at
the Institute of Survey Research, University of Michigan, was
used to impute NHANES DXA data. The IVEware module
IMPUTE performs multiple imputations of missing values with
the use of the sequential regression imputation method. Five
complete records that contained valid and/or imputed values were
created for each survey participant to allow the assessment of
variability due to imputation. Use of the imputed data sets
provides complete DXA data for all participants and ensures

procedures can be found in the Technical Documentation of
Multiple Imputation of NHANES 1999­2004 DXA Data (13).
Age was categorized into 4 groups: 20­39, 40­59, 60­79, and
80 y. To estimate percentile cutoffs, the last 2 age groups were
combined to form 1 age group (ie, 60 y) to ensure adequate
sample size. Race-ethnicity was self-reported and was classified
as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,
and other race-ethnicity. Weight (kg) and height (cm) were
measured with the use of standardized protocol and instruments
(12). BMI (in kg/m2) was calculated with the use of measured
weight and height, and was categorized into 4 groups (,25, 25­
29.9, 30­34.9, and 35) according to World Health Organiza-
tion criteria (14). Triceps skinfold thickness was measured at the
midpoint on the posterior surface of the right upper arm to the
nearest 0.1 mm.
Statistical analyses
We examined the distributions of PBF, TBF, and FFM by sex,
race-ethnicity, age, and BMI. A 2-sample t test was used to
assess the differences in the percentages of demographic char-
acteristics and in the means of DXA data and anthropometric
measures between men and women. Linear regression analyses
were performed to estimate the predicted marginals (adjusted
means) of PBF, TBF, and FFM adjusted for race-ethnicity and
age stratified by sex and BMI, and to generate equations for the
estimation of PBF, TBF, and FFM according to demographic
characteristics and simple anthropometric measures. Pairwise
comparisons of the unadjusted and adjusted means of PBF, TBF,

and FFM between any 2 groups within 4 racial-ethnic groups, 4
age groups, and 4 BMI levels were performed with the use of a t
test with a linear contrast in linear regression models. We esti-
mated selected percentiles of PBF, TBF, and FFM (5, 10, 15, 25,
33.3, 50, 66.7, 75, 85, 90, and 95) by sex, race-ethnicity, and
age. In the subgroup analyses, we present only the subtotal,
rather than age-specific estimates, for participants with "other
race-ethnicity" (Asian/Pacific Islanders, Native Americans,
multiracial persons, and other Hispanic persons) because of
small sample size.
All analyses were conducted 5 times, once for each imputation
data set. The combined estimate of PBF, TBF, and FFM from all 5
analyses was the mean of the 5 individual estimates (15, 16). The
within-imputation variance (W) was calculated as the mean of 5
individual variance estimates, and the between-imputation (B)
variance was calculated as the sample variance of the 5 individual
estimates. The total variance (T) combines the within- and
between-imputation variances as follows: T = W + (6/5) · B.
Results with a P value ,0.001, equivalent to P , 0.05 after
Bonferroni correction for the multiple comparisons, were con-
sidered to be statistically significant in 2-tailed t tests. Data
analyses were conducted with the use of SAS, version 9.1 (SAS,
Cary, NC) and SUDAAN software, release 9.0 (RTI In-
ternational, Research Triangle Park, NC) to account for the
complex sampling design.
RESULTS
A total of 13,066 adults (6559 men and 6507 nonpregnant
women) 20 y of age who had complete data on PBF, TBF, and
FFM measures were included in the analyses. Of these, 165 had
missing data on BMI; thus, the analyses that involved BMI were
based on 12,901 participants. The characteristics of the men and
women in the analytic sample are described in Table 1.
The population distributions (weighted %) of PBF, TBF, and
FFM are shown in Figure 1. There are apparent differences in
the distributions of the weighted % between men and women.
The means of PBF, TBF, and FFM by age groups are shown in
Figure 2. It appeared that PBF and TBF increased with age
before age 55 y and decreased thereafter in women (P for linear

for linear trend: ,0.001). FFM tended to decrease with age in
both men and women (P for linear trend: ,0.001).
On average, women had '12% higher PBF than that of the
men (P , 0.001) (Table 2), and the differences persisted after
adjustment for race-ethnicity and age and across the 4 BMI
categories. In men, non-Hispanic blacks had a lower PBF than
non-Hispanic whites, Mexican Americans, and persons with other
race-ethnicity (all P , 0.001). In women, both non-Hispanic
blacks and Mexican Americans had a higher PBF than non-
Hispanic whites and women with other race-ethnicity (P ,
0.001). However, non-Hispanic black women had a lower PBF
than non-Hispanic white women within each category of BMI,
which suggests possible confounding and/or interaction be-
tween race-ethnicity and BMI on PBF. There was a significant
interaction between sex and BMI (P , 0.001), between race-
ethnicity and BMI in men (P = 0.002) and women (P ,
0.001), and between age and BMI in men (P , 0.001) and
women (P , 0.001) on mean PBF.
On average, women had '5 kg greater TBF than that of the
men (P values , 0.001) (Table 3), and the differences persisted
after adjustment for race-ethnicity and age and across the 4 BMI
levels. In men, non-Hispanic whites had a higher TBF than non-
Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans, and persons with other
race-ethnicity (all P , 0.001). In women, non-Hispanic blacks
had a higher TBF than non-Hispanic whites, Mexican Ameri-
cans, and persons with other race-ethnicity (all P , 0.001).
However, non-Hispanic black women had a lower TBF than
non-Hispanic white women within each category of BMI, which
suggests possible confounding and/or interaction between race-
ethnicity and BMI on TBF. There was a significant interaction
between sex and BMI (P , 0.001), between race-ethnicity and

age and BMI in men (P , 0.001) and women (P , 0.001) on

On average, men had '18 kg greater FFM than that of the
women (P values , 0.001) (Table 4), and the differences per-
sisted after adjustment for race-ethnicity and age. The differences

appeared to widen as BMI increased (15.7, 18.8, 21.1, and
23.8 kg greater FFM at BMI categories of ,25, 25­29, 30­34,
and 35, respectively). In men, both non-Hispanic whites and
non-Hispanic blacks had a greater FFM than Mexican Ameri-
cans, and persons with other race-ethnicity (all P , 0.001).
In women, non-Hispanic blacks had a greater FFM than non-
Hispanic whites, Mexican Americans, and persons with other
race-ethnicity (all P , 0.001). There was a significant interac-
tion between sex and BMI (P , 0.001), between race-ethnicity
and BMI in men (P = 0.04), and between age and BMI in men
(P , 0.001) and women (P = 0.02) on mean FFM. However,
there was no significant interaction between race-ethnicity and
BMI in women (P = 0.08).
The estimated percentile cutoffs of PBF by race-ethnicity and
age groups in men and women are presented in Table 5. The
differences in PBF across race-ethnicity and age groups ap-
peared to be larger at lower percentiles (eg, 5, 10, 15, 25, and
33.3) than at upper percentiles (eg, 50, 66.7, 75, 85, 90, and 95).
At the 90th percentile, there were small differences in PBF
across racial-ethnic groups in both men (35­36%) and women
(47­49%). The equations used to estimate PBF, TBF, and FFM
according to demographic characteristics and simple anthropo-
metric measures are shown in Table 6. The R2 of all 3 equations
ranged from 0.85 to 0.94, which indicates that '85­94% of the
variations in PBF, TBF, and FFM may be accounted for by the
combination of sex, age, race-ethnicity, BMI, triceps skinfold
thickness, weight, and height.
The estimated percentile cutoffs of TBF by race-ethnicity and
age groups in men and women can be found under "Supplemental
data" in the online issue. The differences in TBF across race-
ethnicity and age groups appeared to be larger at lower per-
centiles than at upper percentiles in men, but the differences were
smaller at lower percentiles than at upper percentiles in women.
The estimated percentile cutoffs of FFM by race-ethnicity and
age groups in men and women can also be found under "Sup-
plemental data" in the online issue. In contrast to PBF, the

DISCUSSION
By using a nationally representative sample of US adults, we
described the distributions of PBF, TBF, and FFM and provided
their quantitative estimates according to sex, age, race-ethnicity,
and BMI. Our results clearly showed that women had, on average,
'12% higher PBF, 5 kg greater TBF, and 18 kg less FFM than
men, and the differences persisted across 4 BMI categories.
There were relatively small, but statistically significant, differ-
ences in PBF, TBF, and FFM by race-ethnicity and age group.
Whole-body DXA scans were not administered in the
NHANES mobile examination center until in 1999. In NHANES
III (198821994), BIA data provided approximate body compo-
sition measures in Americans aged 12280 y (8). It is difficult to
compare the absolute numbers of DXA in NHANES 199922004
with those of the BIA data in NHANES III (198821994) because
2 different methods were used to measure at the 2 different time
periods. However, the patterns of the differences in body com-
position by sex, age, and race-ethnicity in the current study are
similar to those reported previously, such that women had greater
TBF and PBF than men, and non-Hispanic black women and
Mexican American women had greater TBF and PBF than non-
Hispanic white women at all ages (8). Nevertheless, our results,
based on NHANES 1999­2004 DXA data, may provide more
reliable and accurate estimates of PBF, TBF, and FFM than
previous reports based anthropometric measures and BIA data.
As shown in validation studies, BIA may underestimate PBF

systematically compared with both the underwater weighing
method (the gold standard for body composition) and DXA (9,
10).
Our results highlight sex differences in body fat in the general
adult population. Similar to previous findings in children, young
adults, and adults (8, 9, 17­20), women in this study generally
had greater estimated mean PBF and TBF than men. Our esti-
mates, with a large population-based sample and DXA, conform
to previous results with smaller samples or less accurate methods
and provide reliable quantitative estimates of the difference in
PBF and TBF between men and women. BMI has been used
widely to define overall obesity in both pediatric and adult
populations because of its simplicity, clinical availability, strong
association with health risks and consequences, and high cor-
relation with PBF (14, 21, 22), although it has been considered
an inaccurate measure of body fat. To date, the universal cutoffs
of 25­29 and 30 have been used to define overweight and
obesity in both men and women (14). A recent study has shown
that BMI corresponds adequately well with PBF by sex and age
subgroups (22). However, in agreement with previous findings
(7, 8), our results suggest that a man and a woman may have
a similar BMI but his or her relative or absolute body fat may
differ appreciably.
Note that the differences in PBF and TBF across age and race-
ethnic groups were more pronounced among men and women
with a BMI ,25 than among those with a BMI 25. Our results
are consistent with the findings of a previous study (23) in which
the researchers showed that mean values of PBF in the normal
and overweight BMI groups were higher in older women than in
younger women. Decrease in muscle density and increase in the
accumulation of body fat mass with age (24, 25) may partially
explain the differences in PBF between the younger and older
adults.
Consistent with other reports (8, 17­19), our results that non-
Hispanic blacks had smaller mean PBF than non-Hispanic whites
across all BMI categories in both men and women suggest that
racial-ethnic variations in body composition may exist. However,
in comparison with differences in PBF between men and women
(12%), differences in PBF between non-Hispanic whites and non-
Hispanic blacks across each category of BMI ('1.4­3.2%) were
relatively small in this study. It is unclear whether such small,
albeit statistically significant, racial-ethnic differences in PBF
may have clinical or public health significance in the diagnosis,
assessment, prediction, and prevention of obesity-related dis-
orders. Future research is warranted to assess the sex and ethnic
variations in the association between PBF and cardiometabolic
risks.
The estimated percentile cutoffs of PBF, TBF, and FFM at
commonly used percentiles by race-ethnicity and age in men and
women may provide a useful reference in clinical settings and
public health services. The equations provided in this article
could be used to estimate a person's relative and absolute body fat
according to his or her sex, age, race-ethnicity, body weight,
height, BMI, and triceps skinfold thickness. Our equations are
simple and have a predictive validity that is similar to or better
than the equations generated in previous studies (26­29). To date,
there is no agreement about the optimal cutoff of PBF for
overweight and obesity. Our data suggest that the cutoffs of PBF
at the 50th percentile for men (28%) and women (41%) (Table 5)
corresponded approximately to the mean PBF in the BMI cat-
egory of 25229 (Table 2). The cutoffs of PBF at the 75th per-
centile for men (32%) and women (45%) corresponded
approximately to the mean PBF in the BMI category of 30234.
The cutoffs of PBF at the 90th percentile for men (36%) and
women (48%) corresponded approximately to the mean PBF in
the BMI category of 35. Future studies may be needed to
determine sex-specific cutoffs of PBF in relation to car-
diometabolic risk factors, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular
disease morbidity and mortality.
Interpretation of our results is subject to 2 limitations. First,
although DXA has been validated by the 4-compartment model
and has been considered a reliable, accurate, and convenient
method for the assessment of body composition, it has not been
established as a "gold standard" for PBF because of variations
with different manufacturers and beam configurations (30). Thus,
caution is warranted when our results are compared with the
findings of other studies. Second, multiply imputed data for
participants with missing or invalid body-composition data
(weighted %: 18.2%) may not perfectly represent the actual
values. However, a large number of variables, including de-
mographic, socioeconomic, and geographic variables, body
measurements, health status, dietary intake, use of medications,
blood test results, and variables related to the NHANES design,
were included in the imputation models (15); therefore, the effect
of imputed data on the validity of the body composition estimates
could be minimal.

In conclusion, by using DXA data from a nationally repre-
sentative sample, we described the distributions and showed the
differences in body composition by sex, age, race-ethnicity, and
BMI categories. Our results highlighted the large sex differences
and relatively small differences in PBF, TBF, and FFM by age and
race-ethnicity across different BMI categories. Because direct
measurement of body composition with the use of DXA is ex-
pensive, the estimated percentiles of PBF, TBF, and FFM in
conjunction with the estimation equations according to de-
mographic characteristics and simple anthropometric measures
could be helpful to clinicians and researchers when they assess
the relative and absolute body fat of their patients or study
participants.
