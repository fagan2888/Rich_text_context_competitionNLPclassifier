Noninvasive monitoring of disease
activity and complications in Crohn's disease
Special Collection
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology
Introduction
Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)
are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastroin-
testinal (GI) tract, collectively known as the inflam-
matory bowel diseases (IBD). The combined
prevalence of these conditions in Western popula-
tions is 450 per 100,000.1 To date, their aetiology
is uncertain, but it is thought that they occur as a
consequence of a combination of host genetic and
environment factors, including dysregulation of
the enteric immune system and alterations in the
intestinal microbiome.2,3
The natural history of IBD is that of quiescence,
interspersed with episodic flares of disease activity.
Maintenance of glucocorticosteroid-free remission
and the avoidance of surgical intervention are the
principal aims of medical management. Evaluation
of longitudinal disease activity, traditionally cen-
tred on patient-reported symptoms, forms the

Abstract
Objectives: Patient-reported symptoms correlate poorly with mucosal inflammation. Clinical
decision-making may, therefore, not be based on objective evidence of disease activity.
We conducted a study to determine factors associated with clinical decision-making in a
secondary care inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) population, using a cross-sectional design.
Methods: Decisions to request investigations or escalate medical therapy were recorded from
outpatient clinic encounters in a cohort of 276 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's
disease (CD). Disease activity was assessed using clinical indices, self-reported flare and
faecal calprotectin  250 µg/g. Demographic, disease-related and psychological factors were
assessed using validated questionnaires. Logistic regression was performed to determine
the association between clinical decision-making and symptoms, mucosal inflammation and
psychological comorbidity.
Results: Self-reported flare was associated with requesting investigations in CD [odds ratio
(OR) 5.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.84­17.0] and UC (OR 10.8; 95% CI 1.8­64.3), but
mucosal inflammation was not (OR 1.62; 95% CI 0.49­5.39; and OR 0.21; 95% CI 0.21­1.05,
respectively). Self-reported flare (OR 7.96; 95% CI 1.84­34.4), but not mucosal inflammation
(OR 1.67; 95% CI 0.46­6.13) in CD, and clinical disease activity (OR 10.36; 95% CI 2.47­43.5) and
mucosal inflammation (OR 4.26; 95% CI 1.28­14.2) in UC were associated with escalation of
medical therapy. Almost 60% of patients referred for investigation had no evidence of mucosal
inflammation.
Conclusions: Apart from escalation of medical therapy in UC, clinical decision-making was
not associated with mucosal inflammation in IBD. The use of point-of-care calprotectin testing
may aid clinical decision-making, improve resource allocation and reduce costs in IBD.

mainstay of outpatient disease activity assessment,
with those with symptoms suggestive of clinically
active disease likely to undergo endoscopic and
radiological investigations to confirm this. Despite
this, the correlation between symptom reporting
and the presence of mucosal inflammation is poor,
particularly in CD.4,5
GI symptoms arising in the absence of inflamma-
tion, which are reported to affect up to 40% of
patients with IBD,6 may lead to uncertainty in
disease activity assessment when based on patient-
reported symptoms alone. Moreover, the pres-
ence of somatoform behaviour, which is
independently associated with the reporting of
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-type symptoms,7
may complicate this situation. Therefore reliance
on symptom reporting alone could result in over-
investigation and overtreatment of patients, lead-
ing to significant financial implications, a potential
for adverse events, and diminishing beneficial
returns in terms of disease outcome,8 while
neglecting asymptomatic patients with ongoing
occult inflammatory activity.
Faecal biomarkers of intestinal inflammation,
including faecal calprotectin (FC), provide a
quantifiable, noninvasive and relatively inexpen-
sive measure of mucosal inflammation. Their use
is advocated in the differentiation of organic and
functional disease9 and, more recently, has been
recommended for the monitoring of disease activ-
ity in IBD.10­12 When compared with endoscopic
disease activity assessment in IBD, FC outper-
forms both clinical disease activity assessment
and serum markers of inflammation, including
C-reactive protein (CRP),13,14 and has a sensitiv-
ity and specificity for the identification of active
inflammation at endoscopy of 93.5% and 79.2%,
respectively.15
Based on our previous findings,4 where the
association between clinical disease activity
scores and the presence of mucosal inflamma-
tion, as defined by FC, was poor, our hypothe-
sis was that there would be no association
between clinical decision-making and the pres-
ence of mucosal inflammation defined using a
FC  250 µg/g, particularly in patients with
CD. If proven, this may support the routine use
of point-of-care FC testing as a cost-effective
method of disease assessment, which may
improve clinical decision-making, facilitate
appropriate allocation of scarce resources, and
reduce the costs of managing outpatients with
IBD. We aimed to compare the cost of investi-
gation requesting based on the current system
of physician global assessment with a novel
hypothetical model where any patient being
considered for investigation would undergo
point-of-care FC testing, with endoscopic or
radiological investigations subsequently
requested only in those with evidence of
mucosal inflammation.
Materials and methods
Participants and setting
The study was conducted at St James's University
Hospital, Leeds, UK, which serves a local popu-
lation of 800,000 people. Consecutive individuals
aged over 16 years with an established radiologi-
cal, histological or endoscopic diagnosis of CD or
UC who were attending the IBD clinic were
approached about the study. Exclusion criteria
were an inability to understand written English, a
diagnosis of IBD unclassified, and anyone with an
end ileostomy or colostomy, due to the difficulties
in assessing disease activity indices in these
patients. Patients who had undergone radiologi-
cal or endoscopic investigations in the preceding
90 days were also excluded as the results of these
investigations were deemed likely to have affected
any subsequent clinical decision-making. Finally,
those with isolated upper GI or isolated fistulising
perianal CD were also excluded, as the utility of
FC in these subsets of patients is uncertain. At
the clinic attendance, prior to the consultation
with a gastroenterologist, individuals were pre-
sented with an information sheet explaining the
nature of the study. Those who agreed to take
part provided written informed consent at this
visit. The study was approved by the Yorkshire
and Humber research ethics committee in
November 2012 (12/YH/0443), and data collec-
tion continued until June 2015. Questionnaire
outcomes and FC results were not available to the
consulting physician at any time. Once the study
questionnaires were completed, patients pro-
ceeded to clinic consultation as normal without
any intervention from the study investigators.
Data collection and synthesis

tics.

marital status, educational level, tobacco and
alcohol use, weight (kg) and height (m), which
were used to calculate body mass index (BMI),
were collected. Medication history, including cur-
rent use of 5 aminosalicylates (5-ASAs), gluco-
corticosteroids, immunosuppressants (including
thiopurines, methotrexate or mycophenolate
mofetil) or biological therapies (infliximab, adali-
mumab or certolizumab) was noted. Disease dis-
tribution and behaviour, as defined by the
Montreal classification,16 and any previous intes-
tinal resection related to CD were also recorded.
Definition and assessment of decision to request
investigation or escalate treatment.Clinic letters
were reviewed to determine clinician decision-
making regarding investigation requesting or esca-
lationoftreatmentinresponsetopatientsymptoms.
Relevant investigations included in this definition
were computed tomography enterography, mag-
netic resonance enterography, small bowel meal,
colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy or wireless
capsule endoscopy for CD and colonoscopy or sig-
moidoscopy for UC. Colonoscopies requested
solely for routine colitis surveillance were not
included.17 Routine investigations requested for
annual disease assessment in patients treated with
anti-tumour necrosis factor  (TNF) drugs were
not included, nor were initial investigations
requested to assess the extent of disease in patients
with newly diagnosed IBD. Escalation of treatment
was defined as either the addition of a new treat-
ment or an increase in dosage of a current medica-
tion. Medications included in this definition were
5-ASAs, glucocorticosteroids, immunomodulators
and biological therapies.
Assessment of IBD activity and mucosal inflamma-
tion. Assessment of clinical IBD activity was per-
formed using the Harvey­Bradshaw Index (HBI)
for CD,18 and the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity
Index (SCCAI) for UC,19 with a score of 5 used
to define clinically active disease for both, as pre-
viously recommended.20,21 Patients completed
these questionnaires prior to consultation, and
the results were not available to the reviewing
physician. In addition to this, participants were
asked to report whether, in their own opinion,
they were attending with a flare of disease activity,
and to provide stool for quantitative FC analysis
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Immun-
diagnostik, Bensheim, Germany), as an objective
marker of mucosal inflammation. We used a cut-
off of 250 µg/g of stool to define evidence of
mucosal inflammation, in line with the European
Crohn's and Colitis Organisation consensus on
the use of FC to measure disease activity,22 which
other investigators have employed.5,23,24 FC was
requested at the time of clinic attendance and, for
inclusion in the study, was returned within 7 days
of this date. FC results were not available at the
clinic visit, and FC testing was not routinely avail-
able to clinicians for disease monitoring in our
centre at the time this study was conducted.
Reference standard used to define the presence of
IBS-type symptoms.The presence or absence of
IBS-type symptoms was assessed via the Rome
III criteria,25 according to the scoring algorithm
proposed for use with the Rome III diagnostic
questionnaire for the adult functional GI disor-
ders. IBS-type symptoms were defined as present
when an individual reported abdominal discom-
fort or pain with a frequency of 3 days per month
over the last 3 months, with the onset of discom-
fort 6 months previously, associated with two or
more of the following: an improvement in pain or
discomfort with the passage of stool, more or less
frequent bowel movements, or looser or harder
stools.
Definition of anxiety or depression.Anxiety and
depression data were collected using the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).26 This
14-item questionnaire consists of seven questions
screening for the presence of anxiety symptoms,
and seven for depression symptoms, with a four-
point response for each item, ranging from 0 to 3.
The total HADS score ranges from a minimum of
0 to a maximum of 21 for both anxiety and
depression. Severity was categorised, according to
total HADS score, into normal (total HADS
depression or anxiety score 0­7), borderline nor-
mal (8­10) and abnormal (11).26
Definition of somatisation severity using the Patient
Health Questionnaire 15.Somatisation data were
collected using the Patient Health Questionnaire
15 (PHQ-15), which is derived from the validated
full PHQ.27,28 The PHQ-15 enquires about the
presence of 15 somatic symptoms (or symptom
clusters) over the last 4 weeks, which contribute
to over 90% of physical complaints reported in
the outpatient environment.29 Each individual
was asked to rate the severity of each symptom as
`not bothered at all' (scored as 0), `bothered a lit-
tle' (scored as 1) or `bothered a lot' (scored as 2).
Therefore the total PHQ-15 score ranges from a
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11 
4 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag
minimum of 0 to a maximum of 30. Somatisation
severity was categorised, using the total PHQ-15
score, into high (total PHQ-15 15), medium
(10­14), low (5­9) and minimal (4) levels of
somatisation severity.
Statistical analysis
Patients were dichotomised into those who were
or were not referred for investigations, those who
received or did not receive escalation of medical
therapy, and those who received either referral for
investigation or escalation of medical therapy, or
those who received neither. We compared base-
line demographic and disease-related characteris-
tics, clinical disease activity indices, the presence
or absence of symptoms meeting Rome III crite-
ria for IBS, FC levels, the presence or absence of
a self-reported flare of disease activity, as well as
anxiety, depression and somatisation scores in
patients with CD and UC separately, for each of
these grouping variables. A 2 test was used for
categorical data and an independent samples t
test for continuous data. Due to multiple com-
parisons a two-tailed p value of less than 0.01 was
considered significant for these analyses.
Independent factors associated with decisions to
request investigations, escalate therapy, or request
investigations and escalate medical therapy were
determined for all patients with CD and UC sep-
arately by performing multivariate logistic regres-
sion to control for all demographic, disease-related
and psychological variables. Results of multivari-
ate logistic regression were expressed as odds
ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
We applied National Health Service (NHS) ref-
erence costs from 2015 in order to calculate the
overall cost of potentially unnecessary investiga-
tions requested in patients with CD and UC
without objective evidence of mucosal inflamma-
tion (defined by FC <250 µg/g). We compared
the mean cost per patient referred for investiga-
tion based on physician global assessment with
that of a hypothetical investigation requesting
pathway when radiology and endoscopy investi-
gations were only deemed necessary in patients
with a FC  250 µg/g (Figure 1). In this hypo-
thetical model, the cost of point-of-care FC anal-
ysis was applied to every patient who was referred
for investigation, but only the cost of investiga-
tions performed in patients with evidence of
mucosal inflammation after FC testing was
included. An independent samples t test was
used with a two-tailed p value less than 0.05 con-
sidered significant for these analyses. The cost of
medication escalation was not included, due to
the uncertainty regarding length of treatment.
Results
In total, 276 patients with IBD fulfilling our
inclusion criteria consented to participate, had
complete HBI or SCCAI data, and returned a FC
sample for analysis within 7 days of their clinic
attendance. Of these, 150 (54.3%) had confirmed
CD and 126 (45.7%) UC.
Characteristics of patients with IBD according
to decision to request investigations
Of the 150 patients with CD, 28 (18.7%) had an
investigation requested. Fifteen (55.6%) of 28
patients in whom an investigation was requested
self-reported a flare of disease activity, compared
with 19 (15.6%) of 122 in whom investigation
was not deemed necessary (p < 0.001).
Investigation requesting was associated with the
presence of clinically active CD, defined by HBI
of 5, but no other demographic, disease-related
or psychological factors. Specifically, the pres-
ence of mucosal inflammation, as defined by FC,
was not associated with investigation requesting
in CD (Table 1).

mucosal inflammation was not associated with cli-
nician decisions to escalate medical treatment.
Ten (47.6%) of 21 patients with CD who under-
went escalation of medical therapy had no evi-
dence of mucosal inflammation, as defined by FC
(Table 3).
Of the 126 patients with UC, 35 (27.8%) under-
went escalation of medical treatment. Younger
age, self-reported flare, SCCAI score of 5, the
passage of four or more stools per day, noctur-
nal passage of stools, urgency, rectal bleeding,
higher mean somatisation scores, and the pres-
ence of mucosal inflammation were associated
with escalation of medical treatment in UC.
Eleven (31.4%) of 35 patients with UC who
underwent escalation of medical therapy had no
evidence of mucosal inflammation defined by
FC (Table 3).
After multivariate logistic regression, younger age
and self-reported flare, but not the presence of
mucosal inflammation, were associated with esca-
lation of medical therapy in CD. In UC, clinically
active disease defined by total SCCAI score of 5
and the presence of mucosal inflammation were
both associated with the decision to escalate med-
ical treatment (Table 4).
Characteristics of patients with IBD according
to decision to request investigations or escalate
medical treatment
Of the 150 patients with CD, 44 (29.3%) were
referred for an investigation or underwent escala-
tion of medical treatment. In univariate analyses,
self-reported flare, anti-TNF use, and clinically
active disease, including poor general wellbeing
and abdominal pain, were associated with the
clinical decision to request investigations or esca-
late treatment in these patients. There was no dif-
ference in mean FC between patients with CD
being referred for investigations or receiving esca-
lation of medical treatment compared with those
who were not (570 versus 464; p = 0.49). In total,
39 (36.8%) of 106 patients with CD who were
neither referred for investigation nor had their
medical therapy escalated had evidence of
mucosal inflammation defined by FC  250 µg/g
(Table 5).
Of the 126 patients with UC, 47 (37.3%) were
referred for an investigation or underwent esca-
lation of medical treatment. Glucocorticosteroid
use, self-reported flare of disease activity, clini-
cally active disease defined by SCCAI score of
5, as well as the passage of four or more stools
per day, nocturnal passage of stools, urgency
and rectal bleeding were associated with referral
for investigation or escalation of medical treat-
ment. Mean FC results (901 versus 323; p <
0.001) and mean somatisation scores (11.1 ver-
sus 8.1; p = 0.002) were significantly higher in
patients with UC being referred for investiga-
tions or receiving escalation of medical treat-
ment compared with those who were not. In
total, 27 (34.2%) of 79 patients with UC
who were neither referred for investigation nor
had their medical treatment escalated had evi-
dence of mucosal inflammation defined by FC
250 µg/g (Table 5).
After multivariate logistic regression, being
married or cohabiting, and a self-reported flare
of disease activity, but not the presence of
mucosal inflammation, were associated with
investigation requesting or escalation of medical
treatment in CD. In UC, self-reported flare and
clinically active disease defined by SCCAI score
 5 were associated with these clinical decisions,
but again not the presence of mucosal inflam-
mation (Table 6).
Costs of investigation requesting in IBD
Of the 28 patients with CD who were referred for
investigations, 16 (57.1%) had no evidence of
mucosal inflammation, defined by FC < 250 µg/g.
In UC, the corresponding figure was 13 (61.9%)
of 21 patients referred for investigations. The cost
of these potentially unnecessary investigations is
described in Supplementary Table 1. In both CD
and UC, the mean cost of investigation per patient
using the current investigation requesting path-
way was significantly more expensive than when
the hypothetical investigation requesting pathway
(Figure 1) was used (£297.77 versus £195.71; p
= 0.004 and £404.29 versus £171.44; p < 0.001,
respectively).
Discussion
In this study we have demonstrated that the pres-
ence of active mucosal inflammation was not
associated with investigation requesting for dis-
ease activity assessment in IBD. In this instance,
self-reported flare of disease activity was the most
consistent factor associated with a clinician's

therapy. After multivariate logistic regression, the
presence of functional symptoms and psychologi-
cal comorbidity, specifically somatisation, was
not associated with an increase in investigation
requesting or escalation of medical therapy in
either CD or UC. Overall, more than one third of
patients with CD and UC were neither referred
for investigations nor had their medical therapy
escalated despite having evidence of occult
mucosal inflammation, based on FC results that
were not available to the attending physician at
the time of clinic visit.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the only
study to address the association between demo-
graphic, disease-related and psychological fac-
tors, and clinical decision-making in IBD, and to
explore the impact of these decisions on costs.
Strengths of this study include the well charac-
terised group of consecutive, unselected patients

who provided complete clinical and psychologi-
cal data. These patients were recruited from a
secondary care population, and the study was
conducted alongside routine clinical care, there-
fore maximising the generalisability of our find-
ings. Our use of validated questionnaires for the
assessment of clinical disease activity,18,19 IBS
symptoms,25 anxiety,26 depression26 and somati-

limitations associated with studies of this nature.
First, the cross-sectional design means that the
relationship between demographic, disease-
related and psychological factors, and clinical
decision-making can only be associative, and the
relative influence of these individual factors on
decisions to investigate or escalate medical treat-
ment cannot be ascertained. Furthermore, the
impact of previous consultations on clinician

decision-making is uncertain, but may be sub-
stantial, and is not accounted for. We were una-
ble to account for the influence of current
glucocorticosteroid use on the decision to esca-
late medical therapy. Here, it is possible that
appropriate escalation of medical therapy to ster-
oid-sparing agents in patients in glucocorticos-
teroid-induced remission may have led to an
overestimate of the proportion of patients
exposed to potentially injudicious prescribing. In
addition, although investigations included in this
study were limited to those requested for the
assessment of inflammatory disease activity, we
acknowledge that 10% of patients with CD in
our cohort had a stricturing disease phenotype,
which may have affected symptom reporting and
thus influenced clinical decision-making, inde-
pendent of inflammatory burden. The utility of
FC in CD is debated, particularly in ileal disease
for which its use is cautioned by some30 but advo-
cated by others.31­33 However, in sensitivity anal-
ysis when patients with CD and isolated ileal
disease were excluded, there remained no asso-
ciation between the presence of mucosal inflam-
mation and clinician decisions to request
investigations or escalate medical therapy, while
patient self-reported flare remained associated
with both. The FC cutoff of 250 µg/g used to
define the presence of mucosal inflammation in
this study may be contentious. Despite this, the
value we used is supported by expert opinion22
and has been widely used in other studies.4,5,23,24
Finally, due to the length of time between
requesting and the date of investigation, any
association between symptom reporting, mucosal
inflammation as defined by FC, and endoscopy
or radiology investigation outcomes could not be
reliably determined.
Our study highlights that the cost of potentially
unnecessary investigations is high, and that the
incorporation of point-of-care faecal biomarkers
of intestinal inflammation into the decision-mak-
ing process may save money. However, these
findings also highlight that 36% of patients with
IBD who were neither referred for investigation
nor had their medical therapy escalated have evi-
dence of ongoing mucosal inflammation. Our
hypothetical pathway for investigation requesting
does not address this group of patients, as it relies
on a physician's global assessment of disease
activity, which failed to identify these cases. That
said, whether a `treat to target' approach, when
patients with occult inflammation receive
escalation of therapy, leads to better long-term
outcomes is currently not fully established and is
not advocated by international guidance.34­37 In
addition, roughly 50% of patients who initially
consented to participate in our study subse-
quently failed to provide a stool sample for FC
analysis. The reluctance of a secondary care IBD
population to provide routine faecal samples is
likely to have implications for the benefit of any
disease activity assessment pathway that incorpo-
rates point-of-care FC, although assessment of
the feasibility of implementing any such pathway
is beyond the scope of this study.
The sensitivity and specificity of both patient-
reported symptoms and the combination of
symptoms included in the HBI at predicting
mucosal inflammation in CD is poor.4,5 Despite
this, poor general wellbeing and abdominal pain
were associated with clinician decisions to esca-
late medical therapy, and a HBI score of 5 was
associated with investigation requesting in CD.
Although, after adjusting for confounding varia-
bles in multivariate analysis, any significant asso-
ciation between clinical disease activity and
clinician decision-making was lost, these findings
highlight potential implications of a reliance on
patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in
disease activity assessment. This is of particular
relevance given that the use of PROMs as out-
come measures in clinical trials in CD has been
advocated by the US Food and Drug
Administration.38 Self-reported flare of disease
activity was the only factor that was consistently
associated with a decision to investigate or esca-
late medical treatment in patients with CD,
despite its poor positive and negative predictive
values for predicting FC  250 µg/g, which were
42.9% and 63.1%, respectively in a previous
study.4
There was no association between clinical deci-
sion-making and mucosal inflammation in CD,
thus highlighting the difficulties in assessing dis-
ease activity when this is based on patient-
reported symptoms alone. Almost half of all
patients with CD who underwent escalation of
medical treatment did not have evidence of
mucosal inflammation, as defined by FC, which
is of particular importance given the lack of effi-
cacy of some of these drugs in patients with a
limited inflammatory burden.8 The use of point-
of-care FC testing may, in this instance, aid deci-
sion-making, improving the appropriateness of
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11

resource allocation, and reducing the risk of
adverse events in these patients.
In UC, escalation of medical therapy was associ-
ated with the presence of mucosal inflammation
and symptoms consistent with clinical disease
activity. This is likely to be due to the greater cor-
relation between symptoms and inflammation in
UC, as has been described previously.4,5 Despite
this, 31% of patients who underwent escalation of
medical therapy did not have evidence of mucosal
inflammation, as defined by FC, suggesting that
clinical decision-making based solely on a physi-
cian's global assessment may be associated with
limited effects in terms of disease outcomes, and
an increased risk of medication-associated adverse
events. After multivariate logistic regression, self-
reported flare of disease activity and lower mean
HADS anxiety scores were associated with deci-
sion to request investigations in UC, suggesting
that clinicians avoid investigations in anxious
patients, rather than overinvestigating them.
Here, the use of point-of-care FC testing may be
useful in reducing the number of unnecessary
investigations, particularly as 13 (61.9%) of
21 tests were performed in patients with a FC
<250 µg/g, at a total cost of £5329.
In summary, self-reported flare was the most con-
sistent factor associated with clinician decision-
making in CD, and investigation requesting in
UC. The presence of mucosal inflammation, as
defined by FC  250 µg/g, was not associated with
the decision to request investigations in either CD
or UC, nor was it associated with escalation of
medical therapy in CD. Escalation of medical
therapy in UC was associated with the presence
of mucosal inflammation and raised clinical dis-
ease activity indices. Almost 60% of investiga-
tions requested for disease activity assessment on
the basis of a physician's global assessment could
have been avoided. The introduction of routine
point-of-care FC testing could, potentially,
improve the appropriateness of clinical decision-
making, streamline resource allocation, reduce
adverse events associated with injudicious use of
medications, and reduce costs.
