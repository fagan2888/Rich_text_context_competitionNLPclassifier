Introduction
In the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, com-
pelling evidence has emerged from field studies in several
affected countries, indicating that the mangrove forests
played a crucial role in saving human lives and property
(Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), 2006). While
the mechanism of wave attenuation in mangroves has been
studied earlier, the extent of protection they offer is still
not clear due to their inherent complexity and high regional
variability (Narayan et al., 2010). Mangroves thrive on
low wave energy coasts, namely, Sundarbans, West Bengal
where tidal amplitude is high and the topography is
gradual. However, in the Pichavaram mangrove wetlands
of Tamil Nadu, wave energy along the coast is high and
tidal range is low, but a sandy beach located between the
Wave attenuation in presence
of mangroves: A sensitivity study
for varying bottom slopes

Abstract
Mangroves thrive in the intertidal areas (interface between land and sea) of tropical and sub-tropical belt and play an
important role in overall attenuation of nearshore waves. Multiple interactions of waves with mangrove trunks and
roots and bottom friction are the two primary mechanisms responsible for wave attenuation in mangrove forests.
Earlier studies, comprising both analytical and experimental, reported an exponential decay in wave height for waves
propagating over vegetation with idealized bottom topography and a few on sloping bottom. But hardly studies have
attempted to characterize the wave attenuation by vegetation over varying seabed slopes since mangroves generally
grow luxuriantly on gradual topography having large tidal amplitudes. Nowadays, several studies are being carried out on
development of artificial mangroves to reduce the coastal hazard risks; thenceforth, there is an imperative requirement
to study the wave damping characteristics of mangroves on varying seabed slopes. Consequently, this study performs
sensitivity experiments to analyze the wave attenuation over mangroves with different sea-bottom slopes using a third-
generation wave model. The study exposes sensitivity of wave attenuation characteristics to different beach slopes in
the presence of mangroves and aims at understanding how the wave attenuation characteristics by mangroves differ
with varying bottom slopes. The total percentage energy reduction for waves reaching the shoreline after propagating
through mangroves on mild slope (1:80, 1:40) is observed to be 93%­98%, nearly 84% for 1:20 slope, and 67% for steep
slope (1:10). The study reveals that the wave height decays exponentially for the mild slope and found to be consistent
with the earlier studies, but as the degree of bottom steepness increases, the wave height reduction becomes gradual,
and this can be attributed to the water depth variation, shoaling, breaking, and reflection characteristics associated with
different slopes, in the presence of mangroves.

mangroves and the sea protects the mangrove wetland,
allowing the propagules to settle and grow (Selvam and
Karunagaran, 2004). In a global perspective, Naskar and
Mandal (1999) reported that small pockets of mangrove
woodland are widely distributed even in steep slope shore-
land near Tupi Island and swampy areas at Tigak
Archipelago between New Ireland and New Hanover.
Even though mangrove forests on steep slopes are rarely
reported, one cannot ignore the possibility of mangroves
thriving on steep slopes, and it opens up a new prospect of
coastal hazard risk reduction by reducing the wave attack
on high wave energy coasts. By mimicking the essential
conditions, mangroves can be grown or artificial man-
groves/patches/island can be implemented on high-energy
coasts that can potentially replace the existing conven-
tional coastal structures for coastal protection. There are
various natural mangrove rehabilitation techniques devel-
oped to adapt the mangrove seedlings to different condi-
tions in the field. Nevertheless, wherever the above
techniques fail, the artificial mangroves made of biode-
gradable and environmental friendly materials can be used
after experimental and field studies. However, it is impera-
tive to understand how these mangrove structures behave
on a steep topography and its efficiency in wave damping
encountering high-energy waves. Also, in certain man-
grove locations, the natural slope of the coast (bathymetry)
is subjected to varying climate change and associated envi-
ronmental factors and it can adversely affect the attenua-
tion efficiency of mangroves and its ecosystem. Hence,
this study finds its importance on mangrove coasts that
eventually may turn steeper in future due to severe erosion
caused by climate change and natural and anthropogenic
hazards. Several studies (Burger, 2005; Meijer, 2005;
Oude, 2010) have conducted extensive sensitivity analysis
of wave attenuation by vegetation where the role of waves
and vegetation characteristics on the wave damping were
analyzed, but scarcely studies have paid attention to the
variation of wave attenuation pattern resulting from vary-
ing bottom slopes and sediment characteristics. Therefore,
in this study, we have conducted synthetic experiments to
simulate the characteristics of wave attenuation through
vegetation over varying bottom topography using a third-
generation numerical wave model. It exposes the sensitiv-
ity of wave attenuation characteristics to different bottom
slopes in the presence of mangroves and aims to under-
stand how the wave attenuation characteristics by man-
groves differ with varying bed slopes during extreme
wind-wave climate.
Review of the literature
Wave attenuation by vegetation has been studied analyti-
cally and empirically (Feagin et al., 2011) since 1984.
Mclvor et al. (2012) provide a comprehensive review on
the wave attenuation characteristics in mangrove
ecosystem and signify the importance of wave attenuation
in multiple ways at different sites and postulated that it is
not possible to present wave attenuation in a standardized
way across different locations. The study by Mei et al.
(2011) has highlighted the analytical and numerical solu-
tions for wave attenuation on the macro-scale for different
water depths and coastal forest configurations. Unlike the
artificial barriers, a bio-shield of mangrove is quite effec-
tive (Muraleedharan et al., 2009; Noarayanan et al., 2012).
The empirical model proposed by Noarayanan et al.
(2012) finds practical application of a green belt as a bio-
shield; moreover, the establishment and maintenance of
coastal vegetation incur only low cost as compared to
concrete structures used for coastal protection (Kathiresan,
2010). Motivated by the concept on the ability of man-
grove plants to convert the mean kinetic energy into tur-
bulent kinetic energy, Fatimah et al. (2008) proposed a
numerical modeling approach for artificial mangrove root
system (ArMS) as an alternative solution to solve coastal
engineering problems in cohesive soil coastlines; the
effort investigated the effect of mangrove-roots-like sub-
merged breakwater. Kathiresan (2003) attempted on the
tidal flows around mangrove vegetation and their role in
the process of sedimentation. His study has provided a
plausible mechanism on the role of mangrove forest on
sedimentation.
Methodology
Several sets of numerical experiments have been con-
ducted in this study to evaluate the impact of mangroves
on wave height under varying bottom topography, that
is, the influence of sea-bottom slopes on wave attenua-
tion through mangroves using a third-generation wave
model, SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore). The per-
centage rate of wave attenuation by mangroves, r, is
defined by

where H0

The SWAN model
The SWAN is a third-generation wave model developed at
the Delft University of Technology, Netherlands that com-
putes random, short-crested wind-generated waves in
coastal regions and inland waters. The SWAN wave model
is a discrete spectral model based on the action balance
equation (Booij et al., 1996), which is mathematically
expressed in the form

tion in SWAN, equation (2) will be extended with Sds veg

based on equation (4). The model includes wave damping
over a vegetation field at variable depths using the cylinder
approach suggested by Dalrymple et al. (1984) and modi-
fied by Mendez and Losada (2004) and The SWAN Team
(2015). In this method, the vegetation is modeled as cylin-
drical obstacles causing a drag force and translated into an
amount of energy that gives an energy dissipation term v

The physical mechanism behind wave dissipation by
vegetation is detailed in previous literatures (Dalrymple
et al., 1984; Kobayashi et al., 1993; Mendez and Losada,
2004; Suzuki et al., 2011). Several studies extensively
validated the model against field studies and experimen-
tal observations in the past, and hence the model is
assumed to extend reliable predictions and used in the
present study.
Hypothetic domains and boundary conditions
Four types of hypothetic domains (Figure 1) were con-
sidered in this experiment having a spatial dimension
of 5 km × 5 km, based upon the degree of steepness,
representing mild to steep slope (1:80, 1:40, 1:20, and
1:10, respectively).
The study domain assumes a maximum water depth
corresponding to 50 m at the offshore boundary and the
gradient of sea-bottom slope vary with depth from open
boundary (offshore) to the coast (nearshore). The open
ocean boundary condition in the experiment assumes a
JONSWAP (Joint North Sea Wave Project) spectrum
with the default peak enhancement factor,  = 3.3.
The waves are considered to approach the coast from
offshore with a significant wave height and wave period
of 9 m and 12 seconds, respectively. The model consid-
ered an extreme wave condition and used the boundary
condition as specified in the work by Nayak et al. (2012).
The effect of tides and current interaction with wave and
vegetation are excluded assuming a small tidal range.
Implementation of mangroves in model
The first set of numerical experiments considered the case
without vegetation for all the selected slopes and subse-
quently repeated after including the vegetation component.
In the latter, the hypothetical mangroves were arranged in
a tandem order in two vertical segments for a distance of
500 m from the coast. In this study, the mangrove forest
has been provided for 500 m considering 10% of the total
domain. As mentioned in a review work by Hashim et al.
(2013), some Asian countries have outlined the minimum
required width for mangrove forests. According to
Lacambra et al. (2008), a mangrove belt between 500 and
1000 m width has been set as a buffer zone in Vietnam
along the Mekong delta coastline. In Philippines, the
buffer zone is 20 m and can reach up to 50 m in storm-
prone areas. In Malaysia, the 1950s regulation specified
200 m mangrove buffer zone before any structures protect-
ing agricultural land (Othman, 1994). The lower layer with
a height of 0.5 m and diameter of 3 cm represented the root
characteristics of the mangroves. The lower layer repre-
sents special roots known as pneumatophores or breathing
roots. The heights of these aerial roots are reported differ-
ently for each region. Therefore, an average value of 50 cm
has been selected for this study. It corresponds to a density
of 100 no/m2, and the upper layer consisted of a single
mangrove stem having a height of 5 m and diameter of 0.2
m. Asano et al. (1993) proposed an adaptation to the for-
mulation by Dalrymple et al. (1984) to include the sway
motion of plants and thereby expand the range of the appli-
cation from only stiff to flexible vegetation. The conclu-
sions of physical modeling studies showed that varying the
drag coefficient is sufficient to model flexible vegetation
(Burger, 2005). This study has referred the previous litera-
tures (Mazda et al., 1997; Narayan et al., 2010) to assign a
drag coefficient of 1 to mangrove stem and 1.25 to roots in
view of the flexibility of stem to account for swaying
motion and the rigidity of roots.

Results and discussions
The simulated significant wave height corresponding to
varying bottom slopes without mangroves and with man-
groves (1:80, 1:40, 1:20, and 1:10) are shown in Figures 2
and 3, respectively.
Mangroves act as a buffer to the water surface from the
effects of wind, thereby reducing the generation of wind-
waves and wave setup and run-up, which make a substan-
tial contribution to storm-surge flood levels and damage
(Mclvor et al., 2012). From the synthetic experiments
(Figures 2 and 3), it is clearly evident that the energy of the
incoming waves is significantly dampened while propa-
gating through the mangroves. The transmitted wave
height across the mangrove forest on steep slope also
exhibits considerable decrease in wave height in the pres-
ence of mangroves. However, the vegetated mild slope
exhibits higher wave dissipation when compared to the
steeper slopes having mangrove vegetation. Figure 4
details the variation in characteristics of wave attenuation
for bottom slopes varying from mild to steep, with and
without mangroves, respectively.
It is clearly evident from this study that the type of
wave attenuation is different for each case. The shoaling
and breaking characteristics are different for various beach
slopes. The relative contribution of damping by vegetation
and breaking is represented in Figure 4. The breaker zone
characteristics essentially depend upon the bottom slope,
incident wave, and tidal variation. The distance of breaker
zone from the coastline is dynamic in nature and changes
with instantaneous water level variations. This study does
not consider the time variation of water level elevation and
assumes that the breaker zone for the respective beach
slopes to remain constant. However, in the field, it changes
for each tidal cycle that may alter the wave decay pattern
depicted in Figure 4. For mild slopes, the waves propagate
for longer distances. Tsai et al. (2002) found that the shoal-
ing distance on steep slope becomes short, and the surface
waves may be partially reflected from the steep bottom.
Generally, spilling breaker dissipates the energy at a slower
rate (Dally et al., 1985). The wave decay on mild slope
occurs prior to the propagation of waves through the man-
grove forest. In Figure 4(a), the wave height decays gradu-
ally for the mild slope, and in the presence of mangroves,
the wave height decays exponentially. The presence of
vegetation results in a drag force which greatly enhances
wave attenuation compared to a smooth bed (Mclvor et al.,
2012). In the case of steeper slopes, waves are found to
decay at the entrance of the mangrove area, which is
located before the breaker zone (Figure 4(d)). It is also
noted that when the waves propagate through the man-
groves on steep slope, the wave height reduction becomes
gradual and the effect is similar to the attenuation on mild
slope without mangroves.
For a mild slope (1:80), where the beach slope gradu-
ally varies, the percentage energy reduction is found to be
98% as the waves approach the shoreline from the offshore
boundary. For 1:40 and 1:20 slopes, wave attenuation rate
is indicated as 93% and 84%, respectively. As the bed
slope gets steepened, the rate of wave dissipation due to
mangroves on 1:10 slope marked an increase of 20% when
compared with that of no mangroves. The attenuation rates

are likely to differ with the variation in the incident wave
characteristics and the vegetation parameters such as spac-
ing, dimensions, and species. The study also solidifies the
fact that the wave dissipation rate on mild slope is maxi-
mum for the first few 100 m of the mangrove forest,
whereas the trend is reverse on the steep slope. The unique-
ness of wave attenuation characteristics for each slope can
be attributed to the water depth variation in different
slopes. There exists an inverse relationship between water
depth and rate of wave dissipation by mangroves. Since

the water depth is lower in the nearshore regions of mild
slope, the waves are attenuated more rapidly as they prop-
agate through the exposed roots which offer more drag
resistance. But in the case of a steep slope, the water level
is higher and the roots are in submerged condition, and the
waves are encountered on stem resulting in lesser attenua-
tion rate. A similar kind of disparity in wave attenuation
characteristics is observed in mangrove environments with
high tidal range.
Kobayashi et al. (1993) assumed an exponential decay
of local wave heights for the small amplitude waves propa-
gating over vegetation

where H is the local wave height (in meters), H0
is the
initial wave height at x = 0 , ki
is the exponential decay
coefficient, and x is the horizontal coordinate considered
positive in the direction of wave propagation. Anderson
et al. (2011) also reported that the wave heights were
observed to decay exponentially through vegetation beds
with the most rapid reduction occurring within the first
few meters of permanent vegetation cover. This study has
computed the local wave height from model simulations
and estimated the wave height decay as H H
i o
/ that was
plotted against the distance of wave propagation ( X ) as
shown in Figure 4. The results obtained for mild or gradu-
ally varying slopes (1:80 and 1:60) have shown good con-
sistency with the earlier studies, but contradict with that of
steeper slopes. As the seabed slope steepens, the trend
shifts from the expression as suggested by Kobayashi et al.
(1993) as shown in Figure 4.
Figure 5 explains the dissipation due to mangroves on
mild slope and steep slope, and also the dissipation by
mangroves on steep slopes can be expressed.
For mild slope

where f(x) is the total energy dissipation, "x" is the width
of mangrove forest, and "a" and "b" are constants. The dis-
sipation rate by vegetation is high on mild slope for the
first 100 m of vegetation width, and for the steep slope, the
dissipation rate increases exponentially as it moves through
the vegetation, and the highest wave dissipation is observed
100 m away from the landward edge of mangrove forest.
The mangrove-dominated Ganges Delta--the
Sundarbans--is a complex ecosystem comprising one
of the three largest single tracts of mangrove forests of
the world. The Sundarbans mangrove forest which is a
part of the head bay region situated in the north of Bay
of Bengal is a low wave energy coast with gentle bottom
slopes and high risk to extreme events, namely, cyclones,
storm surge, sea level rise, so on, and vulnerable to
changing climate. One of the recent studies by Patra and
Bhaskaran (2016) provides clear evidence on the dipole

nature in the wind-wave climate over this region. The
eastern side of the head Bay region bordering Myanmar
experiences an increased activity of both wind and wave
climate, unlike the western side that borders the main-
land of India. Interestingly, there is a shift observed in
the mean sea-level pressure patterns over this region.
More research is warranted to understand these observed
trends in wind-wave activity over the head Bay region,
considering both the atmospheric and oceanographic
components together. Higher wave activity in the coastal
regions along the eastern side is directly linked with
changes in the bathymetric profile. Complex sedimenta-
tion patterns and sediment transport mechanisms play
an important role in dynamic changes in the shoreline
patterns and also the seabed slope. It is felt that some
areas in the nearshore regions off Sundarbans are in a
state of continuous change due to sediment transport
process and tidal action. In the long run, these localized
coastal processes can significantly change the topogra-
phy resulting in steepening of the bottom slope in some
regions. This may adversely affect the mangrove eco-
system, and the characteristic wave energy attenuation
for the region may also vary. Therefore, the present
hypothetical experiment has addressed on how the wave
dissipation varies with abrupt change in natural slope of
the region and quantified the wave height reduction for
varying slopes during extreme waves. The flow field
will be different for each slope and it further affects the
sedimentation in that region. Implementing artificial
mangroves on a steeper beach will significantly improve
the devastating effect of erosion caused by high-energy
waves and further helps in sedimentation.
Conclusion
The key findings from synthetic experiments reveal that
the energy of the incoming waves significantly dampens
while propagating through mangroves for all slope con-
ditions considered in this study. The vegetated mild
slope exhibits higher wave dissipation when compared
to the steeper slopes having mangrove vegetation. The
total percentage energy reduction for waves reaching the
shoreline after propagating through mangroves on mild
slope (1:80, 1:40) is observed to vary between 93% and
98%, nearly 84% for 1:20 slope, and 67% for steep slope
(1:10). The quantitative and qualitative characteristics of
wave dissipation by mangroves differ for each slope due
to which the water depth, shoaling, breaking, and reflec-
tion phenomenon for each slope varies. This study high-
lights that the characteristics of wave height decay
significantly depend upon the slope of sea bottom, and
hence, bottom topography plays an important role in
wave dissipation characteristics by vegetation. This
study is an initial effort to understand how the wave
attenuation characteristics change from mild to steep
slopes in the presence of mangroves, and furthermore, it
develops an idea about the efficiency and behavior of
artificial mangroves on a high wave energy coast.
