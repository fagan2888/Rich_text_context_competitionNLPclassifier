Do Physicians Address Other Medical Problems
During Preventive Gynecologic Visits?
Donna Cohen, MD, MSc, and Andrew Coco, MD, MS
Background: The patient-centered medical home model may be a strategic approach to improve deliv-
ery of women's health care and consistently provide women with accessible and comprehensive care. We
examined whether primary care physicians (family medicine, internal medicine, and hospital general
medicine clinics) and obstetrician-gynecologists differ in scope and the number of medical issues ad-
dressed during preventive gynecologic visits.
Methods: We analyzed data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey to characterize visits with a primary diagnosis of gynecological exami-
nation or routine cervical Papanicolaou test between 1999 and 2008. We compared the number and
type of concurrent nongynecologic diagnoses addressed by primary care physicians and obstetrician-
gynecologists during visits.
Results: A total of 7882 visits were included, representing 271 million primary visits for Papanico-
laou tests. Primary care physicians were 2.41 times more likely to include one or more concurrent med-
ical diagnoses during the preventive gynecologic visit compared with obstetrician-gynecologists (odds
ratio, 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.63­3.57).
Conclusions: Primary care physicians are significantly more likely to address concurrent medical prob-
lems during preventive gynecologic visits compared with obstetrician-gynecologists. These findings demon-
strate the vital role of primary care physicians in providing comprehensive health care to women, consistent
with principles of the patient-centered medical home model. (J Am Board Fam Med 2014;27:13­18.)

The patient-centered medical home and its key
principles, including accessible, comprehensive, co-
ordinated, and patient-centered care, have gained
increasing attention as a national model to improve
the organization and delivery of primary health
care.1­4 In this model, a personal physician pro-
vides preventive, chronic, and acute services so that
patients can receive continuous, integrated care
throughout their lifetime.1­4 These principles may
have particularly significant implications for the
delivery of women's health care because women
may sometimes require multiple visits with differ-
ent providers and systems to address their gyneco-
logic and medical needs.5­14
For many women, a preventive gynecological visit
may be their sole contact with medical care and an
opportunity to address coexisting concerns and med-
ical issues. Family medicine, internal medicine, and
obstetrics/gynecology all provide care to women, but
the extent to which they address multiple medical
problems during a single encounter is unknown. Im-
proved knowledge of the breadth and scope of care
being provided during primary preventive gynecologic
visits may have important implications for women's

health care as we move forward with instituting patient-
centered policies and models of care.
The aim of this study was to compare the num-
ber and type of concurrent medical diagnoses ad-
dressed by primary care physicians and obstetri-
cian-gynecologists during visits with a primary
purpose of gynecological examination or routine
cervical Papanicolaou test. We analyzed data from
the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
(NAMCS) and National Hospital Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) between the
years of 1999 and 2008.
Methods
Design of NAMCS and NHAMCS
The NAMCS and NHAMCS, conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),
contain nationally representative data on ambula-
tory visits in the United States. NAMCS collects
information on patient visits to community, of-
fice-based physician practices, including visits to
federally qualified health centers and nonfederal
government clinics. The database incorporates a
multistage probability design, accounting for
geographic location, physician specialty, and in-
dividual patient visits within the practice. Physi-
cians are randomly selected and assigned to a
1-week reporting period. Data for a systematic
random sample of visits is recorded on a stan-
dardized encounter form and checked for com-
pleteness by NCHS field staff. Sampled physi-
cians complete 30 records per sampling week.
The NHAMCS collects information on patient
visits to nonfederal hospital outpatient departments
and hospital emergency departments. The data
from hospital emergency departments were not
used in this study. NHAMCS incorporates a mul-
tistage probability design, accounting for geo-
graphic primary sampling units, hospital outpatient
departments within primary sampling units, and
clinics within outpatient departments. The final
sampling stage involves systematic random samples
of outpatient department visits during randomly
assigned 4-week reporting periods.
The response rate for physicians sampled in
NAMCS and hospital outpatient departments sam-
pled in NHAMCS between 1999 and 2008 ranged
from 63% to 60% and 82% to 83%, respec-
tively.15,16 Quality control was performed on 10%
of the sample records using a 2-way independent
verification procedure. Item nonresponse rates are
5% for most variables. For this study, major ex-
ceptions include race (18% to 33% annual nonre-
sponse rates) and ethnicity (22% to 35% annual
nonresponse rates). The NAMCS staff imputed
missing data to help compensate for nonresponse
to items involving race and ethnicity. Imputation
was performed by randomly assigning a value from
a patient record form with similar characteristics.
The NCHS weights each visit to allow extrap-
olation to national estimates for all aspects of the
survey. The weights account for practices that were
invited to participate but declined to do so. Na-
tional estimates are considered reliable with a stan-
dard error of 30%, which generally corresponds
to a sample of at least 30 patient visits.15 The
NCHS institutional review board approved the
protocol, including a waiver of the requirement for
informed consent.
Creation of Variables
We examined all ambulatory visits with a primary
purpose of gynecological examination (Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] codes V72.3,
V72.31) and routine cervical Papanicolaou test
(ICD-9-CM code V76.2) and considered these to
represent preventive gynecologic visits.17 Inclusion
criteria included these preventive gynecologic visits
made by women 18 years old. A variable was
created and defined as concurrent medical diagno-
sis, indicating whether the secondary or tertiary
diagnoses included a medical condition or nonpre-
ventive gynecologic condition addressed during the
preventive gynecologic visit. These concurrent di-
agnoses were classified by ICD-9-CM codes in the
following categories: infectious and parasitic dis-
ease (ICD-9-CM codes 001­139); neoplasm (codes
140­239); endocrine and metabolic diseases (codes
240­279); mental health disorders (codes 290­
319); diseases of circulatory system (codes 390­
459); nervous system and sense organs (codes 320­
389); respiratory system (codes 460­519); digestive
system (codes 520­579); genitourinary system
(codes 580­629); skin and subcutaneous tissue
(codes 680­709); musculoskeletal system (codes
710­739); symptoms, signs, and ill-defined condi-
tions (codes 780­799); and factors influencing
health status and contact with health services (codes
800­999). Concurrent diagnoses in the following
diagnostic categories were not analyzed separately
14 JABFM January­February 2014 Vol. 27 No. 1 http://www.jabfm.org
because of insufficient numbers for analysis: disease
of blood and blood-forming organs (ICD-9-CM
codes 280­289) (n  12); congenital anomalies
(codes 740­759) (n  2), and injury and poisoning
(codes 800­999) (n  16). The rate of concurrent
medical diagnosis occurring during a preventive
gynecologic visit represented the primary outcome
of the study.
The diagnostic codes used in the NAMCS/
NHAMCS are not derived from billing informa-
tion. Rather, physicians list diagnoses on a 1-page
survey form near the time of the office visit, which
then are coded by staff at the NCHS central office.
Survey participants are instructed that the intention
is to capture the clinical scope of the encounter
rather than the order or number of problems that
would result in the highest level of billing.
Provider variables include self-selected specialty.
Physician specialty was categorized as a visit occur-
ring with either a primary care physician or obste-
trician-gynecologist. Primary care physicians in-
cluded visits occurring at a family medicine (67%),
internal medicine (21%), or general medical clinic
(12%). In addition, visits were further categorized
by whether the visit occurred with the patient's
primary care physician and based on the provider's
response to the question.
Clinical and demographic data, including age,
insurance status, and race, were collected for each
visit and de-identified.16 Clinical variables included
the primary diagnosis and 2 secondary diagnoses
coded according to the ICD-9-CM.17 The NCHS
divides the country into 4 geographical regions:
Northeast, South, Midwest, and West. Rural loca-
tions were identified based on the designations of
non­metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) by the
US Office of Management and Budget. An MSA is
defined as a county or group of contiguous counties
that contains at least one city with a population of
50,000 or an urbanized area with a metropolitan
population 100,000.18
Statistical Analysis
We calculated standard errors for all results, as
recommended by the NCHS, using STATA soft-
ware version 10 (StataCorp, LP, College Station,
TX).16 STATA was programmed with the masked
survey design variables to account for the complex
multistage sample design and weighting calcula-
tions that allow for making population estimates
and generation of variance estimates that result in
conservative tests of significance.19 We evaluated
categorical variables with the 2 test. Multivariate
logistic regression was performed to examine the
rate of a concurrent medical diagnosis occurring
during a visit with a primary purpose of gyneco-
logic examination or Papanicolaou test by specialty.
All P values are 2-tailed; P  .05 was considered
significant.
Results
A total of 7882 sample records met the inclusion
criteria for the study. These sample records repre-
sented an estimated 271 million (95% confidence
interval [CI], 234­309) preventive gynecologic vis-
its in the United States between 1999 and 2008,
with approximately 29.6 million (95% CI, 24.9­
34.3) visits to primary care physicians and 242 mil-
lion (95% CI, 208­275) visits to obstetricians/gy-
necologists. Obstetrician-gynecologists accounted
for 81.2% of total preventive gynecologic visits,
whereas primary care physicians accounted for
18.8% of the total.
Characteristics of the preventive gynecologic
visits grouped by physician specialty are repre-
sented in Table 1. Visits to primary care physicians
tended to be made by patients between the ages of
45 and 69 years, with higher rates of Medicaid
insurance and self-pay status, and were significantly
more likely to occur in non-MSAs and in the Mid-
west and West geographic regions, compared with
obstetrician-gynecologists (P  .05). Preventive
gynecologic visits were made to primary care phy-
sicians who the patient was significantly more likely
to consider her designated personal primary care
physician compared with obstetrician-gynecolo-
gists (89.7 vs 14.9%; P  .001).
Rate of Concurrent Medical Diagnoses Occurring
During Preventive Gynecologic Visits
Multivariate logistic regression modeling was per-
formed to determine whether a preventive gyneco-
logic visit included a concurrent medical diagnosis
(Table 2). After adjusting for demographic and
insurance variables, primary care physicians were
2.41 times as likely to include a concurrent medical
diagnosis during a preventive gynecologic visit
compared with obstetrician-gynecologists (odds ra-
tio [OR], 2.41; 95% CI, 1.63­3.57). In a similar
way, primary care physicians were 3.29 times as
likely to include more than one concurrent medical

diagnoses during the preventive gynecologic visit
compared with obstetrician-gynecologists (OR,
3.29; 95% CI, 2.00­5.42).
Primary care physicians were significantly more
likely to include a concurrent medical diagnosis for
6 ICD-9-CM diagnostic categories, including en-
docrine/metabolic diseases (OR, 8.13; 95% CI,
3.82­17.31); mental disorders (OR, 2.77; 95% CI,
1.38­5.59); diseases of circulatory system (OR,
3.78; 95% CI, 1.89 to 7.35); diseases of respiratory
system (OR, 14.5; 95% CI, 4.85­43.56); diseases of
digestive system (OR, 6.05; 95% CI, 2.97­12.32);
and diseases of skin and subcutaneous tissue (OR,
4.61; 95% CI, 1.34­15.8). Of note, within the di-
agnostic category of genitourinary system diseases,
primary care physicians and obstetrician-gynecolo-
gists included an equal rate of concurrent diagnoses
during the preventive gynecologic visit (12.0% vs
12.2%).
Discussion
Primary care physicians were 2.41 times more
likely to include one or more concurrent medical
diagnoses during a preventive gynecologic visit
compared with obstetrician-gynecologists (OR,
2.41; 95% CI, 1.63­3.57). Primary care physicians
were significantly more likely to include one or
more concurrent medical diagnosis for 6 ICD-
9-CM diagnostic categories, including mental dis-
orders and diseases of the endocrine/metabolic, cir-
culatory, respiratory, and digestive systems and the
skin (P 0.001 for each).
Previous studies demonstrate that women are
unlikely to receive comprehensive preventive ser-
vices in a single non-illness-related visit and that
use of multiple providers for primary care services
is more costly.10,20 Our findings further indicate
that women who receive preventive gynecologic
care from primary care physicians may receive
more coordinated, comprehensive health care be-
cause multiple medical issues are addressed during
the encounter. Preventive gynecologic visits may
represent the sole time during a year that women
seek health care and therefore represent a chance to
address coexisting diseases that do not involve the
female reproductive system, such as disorders of
the endocrine or circulatory systems or mental
health disorders. It is plausible that acute or chronic
complaints not addressed during preventive gyne-
cologic visits may represent a missed opportunity
for some women.
This analysis is unable to answer the question of
whether those women seen by obstetrician-gyne-
cologists for preventive gynecologic visits had sub-
sequent visits with other health care providers at
which additional screening, treatment, and coun-
seling of nongynecologic diseases were completed.
However, a woman's need to rely on multiple visits,
often with multiple physicians, throughout their
life for primary health care needs conflicts with the
current principles and ideals of the patient-cen-
tered medical home.1­4,20

Obstetrician-gynecologists are well equipped to
provide preventive gynecologic health care to
women of all ages. However, primary care en-
compasses a much broader scope of care than
preventive services, including the ability to ini-
tially evaluate and treat a variety of presenting
problems.7,21,22 Similar to obstetrician-gynecol-
ogists' primary care practice patterns found by
Coleman et al,23 we found that primary care
physicians were significantly more likely than
obstetrician-gynecologists to address the follow-
ing diagnoses during a preventive gynecologic
visit: mental disorders and endocrine/metabolic,
circulatory, respiratory, digestive, and skin/sub-
cutaneous diseases.23 Primary care physicians ad-
dressing concurrent nongynecologic medical is-
sues is a component of receiving continuous,
comprehensive women's health care.
Our analysis of this nationally representative da-
tabase has several inherent limitations. We are un-
able to address any outcomes or quality of care,
which might affect the interpretation of the study
findings, recognizing that the ultimate goal of co-
ordinated and comprehensive care is improved
health outcomes. Second, NAMCS data provide a
snapshot of a single visit rather than tracking indi-
vidual patients over time, making it impossible to
determine whether obstetrician-gynecologists may
have recognized concurrent medical problems but
referred patients to another provider for manage-
ment. This practice of referring to another physi-
cian would still signify a less timely and less com-
prehensive approach to care and thereby does not
detract from the study conclusions. In addition,
NAMCHS categorizes specialty as only general
medical clinic, not allowing for any individual anal-
ysis of specialty by internal medicine or family
medicine. The NAMCS database contains limited
data on the contribution of mid-level providers to
outpatient preventive gynecologic visits, prohibit-
ing any analysis of visits made to independently
functioning nurse practitioners or midwives. Last,
in this database rural status was considered to be
non-MSA as defined by the US Office of Manage-
ment and Budget.18 This designation, however, oc-
curs at the county level and may actually misclassify
smaller, rural areas as urban if they are located
within a county considered to be an MSA.
Conclusion
Primary care physicians are significantly more
likely to address concurrent medical problems dur-
ing preventive gynecologic visits compared with
obstetrician-gynecologists. These findings demon-
strate the vital role of primary care physicians in

providing accessible and coordinated health care to
women and fulfilling the key tenets of the patient-
centered medical home.1­4 Providing patient cen-
tered care to women may require improved coor-
dination between primary care physicians and
obstetrician-gynecologists to ensure that women
receive comprehensive care. A potential patient-
centered model of care may include having multi-
disciplinary sites where women have access to dif-
ferent providers who can work together to provide
optimal care at one site. As US health systems
increasingly adopt these patient-centered princi-
ples, the role of primary care in meeting the unique
needs of women's health should be considered to
provide women with comprehensive preventive and
primary care within the medical home. For women,
this may prove to be a critical factor as they strive
to ensure that both their gynecologic and nongy-
necologic health needs are addressed.
