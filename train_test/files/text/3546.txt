Prologue: What Was All the Media
Hype About? The "Tamworth Case"
In 2006, the federal government of Australia made a request
to the Tamworth City Council for the town to become a
regional resettlement location (ABC News, 2006) under the
broader Humanitarian Settlement in Regional Australia
Program (Department of Immigration and Citizenship
[DIAC], 2011). The Tamworth Scheme would be similar to
the Regional Humanitarian Settlement Pilot programs
"already running in Goulburn, Wagga Wagga and Coffs
Harbour, and other towns across the country" (Munro &
Welch, 2007). Under the Tamworth Scheme, up to 10
Sudanese families would be resettled in the town each year.
However, according to the ABC News (2006),
The council [ . . . ] made it clear [to the government] it will only
accept the refugees if the proposal has widespread community
support. A public meeting held [in August 2006] highlighted deep
resentment to the idea and a survey [ . . . conducted thereafter]
exposed further opposition to the move. [When] the council [ . . . ]
released the survey results, [ . . . ] [they showed] only 96 of 393
participants [ . . . were] in favour of accepting the refugees.
As a result, at a meeting in December 2006, the Tamworth
Council refused the federal government's proposal for an
initial resettlement of five Sudanese families in the town.
According to media reports, the council voted six to three,
"to spurn the offer by the Department of Immigration to
resettle the families" (Norrie, 2006, p. 3). The council's deci-
sion attracted negative (national and international) media
coverage and attention: On the 15th of December, newspa-
pers all over Australia, and indeed internationally, widely
reported and condemned the decision as a race-based deci-
sion, that is, based on racial prejudice and stereotypes (of
Sudanese people and culture). The decision was reported and
condemned as an act of racism. "The mayor, James Treloar,
came under fire for what were regarded as racist comments
when he said the town wasn't coping with the 15 Sudanese
refugees who already lived there" (Frost, 2007, p. 21). He
"said the city was struggling with the 15 refugees it already
had, stating they were having problems assimilating" (Clifton,
2007).

Media Event, Racial Ramblings, or Both?
An Analysis of Media Coverage of the
Tamworth Council Sudanese Refugees
Resettlement Case (2006)
Kwamena Kwansah-Aidoo1 and Virginia Mapedzahama2
Abstract
This article presents our analysis of Australian media reporting of the 2006 Tamworth City Council's decision to refuse the
resettlement of five Sudanese families in Tamworth (NSW) and subsequent reversal, supposedly due to the pressure brought
to bear on the council as a result of the media "hype." The question at the core of our analyses is as follows: Did the media
play a role in the over-(re)presentation of this case as racist or was it just a case of the media reporting racism? Informed by
media framing theory, we examine print media reports for patterns of presentation as well as representations of both the
council and the refugees who were the focus of the reporting. We conclude that while the media played a significant role in
making visible a case built on racial stereotypes, their reporting also contained racializing and paternalistic stereotyping that
contribute to the reproduction of both everyday and systemic racism.

So, did the media really report an act of racism or was this
just another instance of media-fuelled racism? Or, could it
have been both?
Introduction
Some researchers have suggested that media coverage of any
societal happening(s) can be done in such a way as to turn it
into a "media event," and elevate such happenings to a level
of importance that would otherwise not be attained (see, for
example, Iyengar & Simon, 1997; Kwansah-Aidoo, 2003).
They suggest that this happens as a result of the "heavy
mediation," in terms of coverage that goes on, and also the
nature of such mediation, in terms of the frames adopted for
covering what is happening, which eventually influence the
way people think about it (see, for example, de Vreese,
Boomgaarden, & Semetko, 2011; Entman, 2002; Iyengar,
1991). Iyengar (1997) for instance, suggests that the media
can influence the importance people attach to issues or events
through the subtle means of "framing." In a similar vein, the
role the media play in the construction and reproduction of
the "refugee narrative" has been the focus of much research
in recent years. In remaining critical of the media's signifi-
cant (albeit subtle) role in shaping and amplifying public atti-
tudes and perceptions toward refugees, much of this
significant body of work has focused not only on media mis-
information, but also on how the media presents negative
and distorted images of refugees thereby influencing public
opinion. The power of the media to influence what people
think about through their agenda-setting function has been
established through over 200 publications on the subject
(see, Kwansah-Aidoo, 2005) and how people think about
what is presented to them, through framing has also been
well documented (see, for example, de Vreese et al., 2011).
This article adds to the body of work described above by
analyzing the media reporting of the Tamworth Sudanese
refugee case described in the prologue. In this particular
case, it can be argued that the issue at stake (refugee resettle-
ment and also race relations in Australia) was a complex one,
making public opinion about it unstable, and therefore sub-
ject to influence through framing of the issue by both the
political elites and the news media (de Vreese et al., 2011).
Informed by Media Framing theory, we argue that while
the media reports exposed the "ordinariness" of racism, the
media reporting in itself, that is, the framing of it, was done
in such a way as to turn the issue into a media event "par
excellence" (Iyengar & Simon, 1997, p. 256) and also con-
struct the council's decision as based on race, thereby mak-
ing the whole event an act of "racial consumption" (Carbado,
2005, p. 635). The media engaged in what we describe as,
"normalised" reporting of the "other" that, though presented
as an egalitarian and objective attempt to expose racism and
"close" the racial gap, was imbued with racial overtones con-
sumed by the White majority. Framing can help us understand
the way in which the media attempt to influence individuals
in their efforts to make sense of everyday issues that occur in
the socio-political and economic realms of their lives (Chong
& Druckman, 2007; de Vreese et al., 2011; Slothuus & de
Vreese, 2010). Framing can also present us with a more criti-
cal way of looking at the media reporting that took place and
thereby make a valuable contribution to the literature on the
"refugee narrative."
Interrogating media coverage of the Tamworth Case using
the conceptual framework offered by Framing is pertinent
for a number of reasons. First, apart from economic and
political/geo-strategic considerations, the issue also contains
cultural dimensions (de Vreese et al., 2011) and is therefore
significant in the light of on-going attempts at addressing
racism in Australia (see, for example, The Australian Human
Rights Commission, 2012), public discourses about multi-
culturalism, and also the choice of multiculturalism as offi-
cial cultural policy. Second, the subject matter provides an
interesting case to study how news frames can affect/influ-
ence the decision making of elected bodies (in this case, pos-
sibly cause a change of mind/decision by the Tamworth
Council). Third, the issue is of major importance to the future
direction of government refugee settlement policy, and for
gaining both public and council support for such policy, as
well as for the future of multiculturalism inAustralia. Finally,
it can help in understanding the subtle and incessant way in
which racism reproduces itself in the Australian society,
through seemingly objective and benevolent ways of report-
ing the "other."
Whereas some commentators have argued that "there is a
general expectation that the media will provide accurate,
unbiased and complete information" (Wilson, Bonevski,
Jones, & Henry, 2009), the discussion in this article will
show that the information that the media disseminated was
not in itself unbiased, rather it was framed in particular ways,
"stressing certain aspects of reality" while "pushing others
into the background" and suggesting "certain issue attri-
butes, judgments and decisions" (Lecheler & deVreese,
2012, p. 186). It is worth noting at this point that, for pur-
poses of this article, only online print media coverage is pre-
sented and analyzed, hence all reference to "media" in this
article refers to "online print media." This is due to the fact
that the search for media reports was conducted more than 5
years after the event occurred, and the easiest access to
reporting of the event was through online print media. An
initial search for media reporting on the Tamworth event
found only one video, hence the decision to limit the analy-
ses to print media.
News Framing and Audience
Understanding
The issue and nature of refugee settlement is such that media
coverage can offer multiple and varying points of under-
standing. As a result, it is important to identify which par-
ticular aspects of the entire Tamworth Refugee Settlement
Kwansah-Aidoo and Mapedzahama 3
issue of 2006 were highlighted at the expense of others. In an
attempt to understand how framing works, many studies
have specifically investigated the ways in which the news
media frame messages, how news frames affect audiences,
and the circumstances under which audiences are influenced
(de Vreese et al., 2011). Historically "framing" was applied
to how journalists and editors selected certain facts, themes,
and so on, to present (frame) a story in a way that will gener-
ate maximum interest and understanding among audiences
(Willcox, 2001). Entman (2002) notes that frames "call
attention to some aspects of reality while obscuring other
elements, which might lead audiences to have different reac-
tions" (p. 394). He explains further,
To frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and
make them more salient in a communicating context, in such a
way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal
interpretation, moral evaluation and / or treatment
recommendation for the item described. (Entman, 2002, p. 391)
This means that in discussing issues, events, or objects
that the media present, framing ensures that attention is paid
to only a small number of attributes (McCombs & Estrada,
1997). As Iyengar (1991, p. 11) has observed, "Framing is
the subtle selection of certain aspects of an issue by the
media to make them more important and thus to emphasize a
particular cause of some phenomena." A media frame there-
fore is "the central organising idea for news content that sup-
plies a context and suggest what the issue is through the use
of selection, emphasis, exclusion and elaboration" (Tankard,
Hendrickson, Silberman, Bliss, & Ghanem, 1991, p. 3).
Framing is important in assessing media coverage because
if the media can tell people what to think about, as has been
proved overwhelmingly in agenda-setting research, "then it
stands to reason that the media can also influence how peo-
ple think about what they tell them to think about" (Kwansah-
Aidoo, 2005, p. 48). Indeed, some agenda-setting scholars
have argued that not only do the media provide cues about
the salience of certain topics and issues, but they also tell
people how to think about these topics and issues (McCombs,
1992; McCombs, Lopez-Escobar, & Llamas, 2000).
Some scholars have observed that frames, apart from
influencing the way people think about an issue, can also
affect the content of people's beliefs (Shah, Kwak,
Schmierbach, & Zubric, 2004; Slothuus, 2008; Slothuus &
de Vreese, 2010). Actually, de Vreese et al. (2011) argued
that frames not only affect the importance of beliefs but also
directly affect attitudes. This may happen either through the
provision of valence to the frame or by offering new consid-
erations (Slothuus, 2008; Slothuus & de Vreese, 2010). It has
also been suggested that some frames carry more "weight"
than others thus making the valence of some frames stronger
than others, and their consideration important (Chong &
Druckman, 2007). Valenced news frames, as de Vreese et al.
(2011) note, provide an indication of the "inherent good and
positive or bad and negative aspects" of the news story. Some
scholars such as Shah et al. (2004), de Vreese et al. (2011),
and Schuck and de Vreese (2006) have argued that the
valence news frame is important because it can affect both
cognitive responses and attitudes.
Entman (2002) points out that "frames highlight some bits
of information about an item that is a subject of a communi-
cation, thereby elevating them to salience," and defines
salience as "a piece of information more noticeable, mean-
ingful or memorable to an audience" (p. 392). In that regard,
research has shown that negative information tends to be
more salient and memorable than positive information (de
Vreese et al., 2011; Johnson-Cartee & Copeland, 1991; Lau,
1985).
There is conflicting research evidence regarding how
framing interacts with political sophistication to produce
effects. While some studies (see for example, Kinder &
Sanders, 1990; Valentino, Beckmann, & Buhr, 2001) have
shown that less politically sophisticated people have a higher
susceptibility to framing effects, others such as Druckman
and Nelson (2003), Lecheler and de Vreese (2012), Slothuus
(2008), and Sniderman and Theriault (2004) found a reverse
relationship, showing "the moderately or most politically
aware to be more responsive to news framing," particularly
where the issue concerned is multi-faceted (de Vreese et al.,
2011, p. 184). Accordingly, we would expect that all things
being equal, the negative valenced news frames used in the
coverage of the Tamworth refugee case had a strong effect on
the council.
Method
The analyses in this article are drawn from the content of 29
newspaper articles (online print media) sourced from an
online search of Google and the newspaper database: News
Bank conducted from April to November 2012 (refer to
Table 1).
For purposes of this article, articles by the same author(s)
that were published as (slightly) different editions/versions
under different headlines have been considered as different
articles. This is primarily because headlines are significant
for the analyses we engage in here, and also some of the dif-
ferences have implications or the potential to alter the narra-
tive being constructed. Initially, search terms were Tamworth,
Sudanese, and refugee as keywords. The key word search
included title, abstract, and body, and was not limited by
date. For purposes of this discussion, any newspaper article
reporting on the case was included in this study, regardless of
the article's length. On the other hand, any articles that were
not (entirely) about council's decision (or reversal thereof),
but instead only made reference to the case, are not included
for analysis. In other words, the criterion for inclusion was
that the article should substantially focus on reporting the
case, not a casual reference to it while reporting on some-
thing else. Moreover, given that the focus is on how the

media reported the case, responses or comments/responses to
media articles (this includes letters to the editor) have also
been excluded. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that the
responses are significant in that they not only expose how
people respond to reports (hence the power of the media),
they may also be useful for insights into broader community
attitudes.
Of the 29 newspaper articles, 15 were published before
the council reversed its decision, that is, they were about the
Council's initial decision of rejecting the refugees, and the
remaining 14 reports were about the council's rescinded
decision. Very few of the 29 articles did not make references
to race. A content analysis revealed that out of the 15 articles
that reported on the council's initial decision, 13 used the
words race, racism, or racial, and these words altogether
occurred a total of 31 times in these articles. The words/
phrases Cronulla, Cronulla riots, and Cronulla type situation
were used in 11 publications, occurring a total of 19 times.
Out of the 14 reports that dealt with the council's reversal of
their initial decision, only four mentioned race, racism, or
racial, with these words occurring a total of 14 times, while
the words/phrases Cronulla, Cronulla riots, and Cronulla
type situation occurred only once in a publication. While
these findings about word count are important, what is even
more significant is the discourses that were circulated within
these media reports and how these words were used to frame
the reports to paint a certain kind of picture for readers
through emphasizing a particular cause of this phenomena
(Iyengar, 1991) and influencing how people would think
about what they were telling them to think about (Kwansah-
Aidoo, 2003). Consequently, the discussions here apply ele-
ments from content analysis to the media language and
discourse to highlight the biases in the ways in which media
reported the events surrounding this case. Schulz (2008)
notes that
[A] major tool in modern communication management is
discourse analysis. The rationale behind discourse analysis
holds that discourses (linguistic constructions) are used within
and describe cultural, political and community ideas and, so,
both construct and sustain the specific forms of knowledge and
understanding among the general public. (p. 225)
The approach we adopt here to determine the media
frames adopted in the coverage of the Tamworth case is
partly in line with that suggested by Matthes and Kohring
(2008). Following (Bell & Entman, 2011), "We scrutinize
the most concrete, measurable subsidiary attributes of media
discourse at a granular level of analysis rather than making
broad thematic statements about news coverage" (p. 555). To
make a case for framing and also racialization, we are espe-
cially interested in how the media supplied information that
would enable and encourage citizens and politicians, in par-
ticular ways as suggested by Delli Carpini and Keeter (1997),
Bell and Entman (2011) or Hacker and Pierson (2005), to see
the Tamworth Council's initial decision as racist and the
whole issue as being about racism. Specifically, we adopted
a consistent system of analysis in dealing with the reports.
First, the reports were searched to identify recurring regulari-
ties in terms of discourses. It was then determined that these
discourses or discursive regularities contained and reflected
certain themes; these themes were further sorted into frames.
The frames were determined from the number of times cer-
tain words or combination of words (phrases), that served to
highlight some bits of information making them more
"noticeable, meaningful or memorable" (Entman, 2002,
p. 392), were used in the reports. Afterwards, the reports
were carefully examined to ensure that the frames within
each theme were the same and deserved to be grouped
together. In the same vein, the themes were carefully exam-
ined for differences so as to ascertain that words/phrases
that had been grouped under the different frames were dis-
similar and could be classified under the determined frames.
This process ensured that all aspects of the reports received
the same attention and treatment. It is worth pointing out
though that our analyses here does not attempt to discuss
every element of the articles, but as is acceptable in these
kinds of analyses, we only focused on the aspects that
seemed useful to answering the concerns of framing and
racialization (Mckee, 2003).
According to Schulz (2008), the "recurrent and patterned
use of language elements such as lexical choice, syntactical
structuring, genres and rhetorical constructs can deliver pre-
ferred versions of understanding on a specific subject"
(p. 225), similar to framing as previously discussed. Our
analyses in the discussion that ensues concentrates on two
significant issues that we argue are evident in the media's
language, highlighting that the media coverage was inten-
tionally meant to portray racism or race as "the" factor in the
councils' decision. First are the headlines, whose wording
was not only deliberately meant to "catch" the reader's atten-
tion but also to "shock." Second, is the methodical centering
of, and emphasis on, the aspects of the case, to the exclusion
of others (framing) that can readily and easily be interpreted
as racist. Here we concentrate in particular on the strategic
and constant citing of the Tamworth City Council Mayor's
(Mayor Treloar; implicit and explicit) race-based comments
on the decision. In addition, it follows that in a discussion of
this nature, a question be asked on whether the media "raced"
this event: Did they make a racism case out of a non-raced
decision, or did they simply report on racism? Our conten-
tion is that while the council may have had legitimate reason
to refuse the resettlement on the basis of inadequate resources,
racial stereotyping and prejudice also played a part in com-
ing to that decision. We conclude our analyses by discussing
how the media coverage, though it may be interpreted as
"pro-Sudanese refugees," may have also re/produced certain
negative and problematized images of Sudanese refugee
subjectivity.

Putting Race Upfront: What's in a
Headline?
Headlines seem to matter on their own . . . they inevitably
enhance or "play up" some information while suppressing other
information. (Andrew, 2007, p. 29)
Andrew (2007) observes that "functionally speaking, head-
lines are simplifying mechanisms that summarize and attract
attention to what lies ahead (or below)" (p. 24). A news head-
line "encapsulates the entire story" (Chiluwa, 2011, p. 89)
and to that extent, it can be argued that, to all intents and
purposes headlines constitute part of the framing mecha-
nisms used by journalists and that, perhaps more than any
other aspect of the news story/article they (the headlines)
highlight particular frames adopted in a story.
Accordingly, it is now widely acknowledged that head-
lines "can have a powerful effect on the attitudes that people
adopt" (Andrew, 2007, p. 25). Arguing along similar lines,
Schulz (2010) notes that "when a specific position is consis-
tently highlighted throughout media headlines [and reports]
it establishes a theme or recurrent motif" (p. 70), which is
"used then in a promotional type of role to sustain reader
interest or shock" (Schulz, 2012, p. 4). Citing van Dijk
(1998), Schulz (2012) further describes headlines as "seman-
tic macrostructures, which lead media consumers into what
to think" (p. 6). One could argue therefore, that in the case of
the Tamworth Council's decision, the media headlines repre-
sented framing that was meant to present the case as being
about race and provoke reactions or attitudes to racism.
Some of the headlines explicitly included the word racist,
racial, or race, clearly intended to incite outrage toward an
act of racism. The examples below are illustrative:
·
· "Racism Alive, Sick in Tamworth" (Mirko Bagaric;
Geelong Advertiser, Tuesday December 19, 2006)
·
· "NSW City Refuses Refugees Claims of Racial
Hatred" (Susanna Dunkerley, The Mercury (Hobart),
December 16, 2006
·
· "Singing From a Different Songsheet: Race Row
Council Still Divided" (Lillian Saleh, The Daily
Telegraph, January 17, 2007[Edition 1: State)
·
· "`Racist' Council's Apology of Sorts--Tamworth's
About-Face" (Lillian Saleh, The Daily Telegraph,
January 17, 2007 [Edition 4: City Edition])
Moreover, the articles that were explicit about racism in
the headlines tended to have lead paragraphs that also linked
the decision directly to racism. The lead paragraph for
Bagaric's (2006) article, for example, said,
SUDANESE have black skin and are often Muslim but in every
meaningful respect they are the same as every other person in
Australia. That's a lesson civic leaders in Tamworth who have
refused to re-settle five Sudanese families need to have drilled
into them. Otherwise, their town, which has been votedAustralia's
most friendly, might also get the mantle as the most racist.
(p. 17, emphasis added)
The lead above is not surprising and only goes to buttress
the point about the intended frame of the report as repre-
sented in the headline. Journalistically, the lead immediately
follows the headline in order of importance, and together
they represent the most notable part of the story. They com-
bine to provide a gist of what the story is about and what is
most significant, and must therefore necessarily work
together. In fact, in journalistic terms, the lead is merely an
expansion of/on the headline. Consequently, those two parts
of the story taken together will offer the most clues about the
frame/s adopted by any story. The lead cited above therefore
proves that the story was racially framed. The tone of the
lead and the subtle reference (Iyengar, 1991) to skin color,
religion, and so on, as well as the suggestion that Tamworth
will become known as the most racist town in Australia, all
point to an intention to highlight race and to make race and
racism the most important aspect of the case/story.
Similarly, Saleh's (2007) article "`Racist' Council's
Apology of Sorts--Tamworth's About-Face" had the follow-
ing lead paragraph/sentence:
A COUNCIL accused of racism for refusing to take more
overseas refugees apologised to its African population last night
and reconsidered its stance. (p. 12)
Again, here the headline and lead work in tandem in the
effort to frame the case/story as being about race/racism. The
choice of words and the inclusion of the words race and rac-
ism in the headline and lead are all pointers. Also, by high-
lighting that a council that had been previously "accused of
racism" had now apologized, Saleh infers that the council
knew it was being racist, and was apologizing for the act of
racism. All of these provide hints and show coverage in par-
ticular ways (framing) that encourage the audience to see the
Council's initial decision as racist (Delli Carpini & Keeter,
1997; Hacker & Pierson, 2005). In fact, when Saleh cites the
mayor's clarification of his earlier statement that compared
having Sudanese in Tamworth to Cronulla riots (discussed in
detail in the ensuing section), this reinforced the inference
that the council was apologizing for racist behavior:
I used them as an example of where the program had failed--not
to say they were a lawless mob running riots in Tamworth or that
I was concerned about them forming gangs and getting like
Cronulla . . . (p. 12)
Most of the headlines, however, were only implicit in
their reference to race: that is, they did not explicitly reflect
the discussion about race and racism in the article. For exam-
ple the Daily Telegraph's "Sour Notes--Shame of a Town
Called Malice" (Clare Masters, 2007) was in fact extensive
in its coverage/discussion of race relations in Tamworth. The
article focused on the Council's explanation of its decision
Kwansah-Aidoo and Mapedzahama 7
and was one of the few that sought to include multiple voices.
There were at least three voices included: the Tamworth
Sudanese refugee voice (including their thoughts on/reac-
tions to the mayor's comments/Council's decision, as well as
their general racial realities in Tamworth), the mayor's com-
ments, and Tamworth residents (both those who supported
the resettlement and those who opposed it).
Furthermore, some of the articles only implied race, rac-
ism, or racial prejudice in the headline, yet also often had
lead paragraphs/sentences that made reference to race/rac-
ism. For example, the lead paragraph of the Sydney Morning
Herald's article, "You're Not Welcome, Town Tells
Refugees," had the following lead sentence:
A month before Tamworth hosts overseas musicians and fans at
its world-renowned country music festival, the NSW town has
become embroiled in a racism row over a decision to reject five
Sudanese refugee families. (Norrie, 2006)
It can also be argued here, that while most of the headlines
were racially implicit, they were nonetheless framed in ways
that portrayed the council's decision as morally appalling
thus confirming Entman's (2002) suggestion that framing
seeks to promote a particular way of defining a problem and
moral evaluation. This kind of framing can potentially con-
tribute to a "fear discourse" (Schulz, 2008, p. 227) and
potentially create a moral panic about racism or perhaps
more specifically racial panic or racial anxiety (Abel, 2011,
p. 5) among the readers or the wider Australian community.

"If That is Racism, Then Call Me a
Racist!" The Utterances of Mayor
Treloar
Almost all of the articles reviewed began with the mayor's
racially provocative comments. In most of the reports
included here, the mayor's utterances cited were either
implicitly or explicitly racist. Below are some excerpts that
exemplify the mayor's utterances that dominated media cov-
erage of the council's decision from December 15, 2006:
Mayor James Treloar said, "The community is concerned that
allowing (the families) to move here could lead to a Cronulla
riots-type situation. Ask the people at Cronulla if they want
more refugees." (Norrie, 2006)
"The community has expressed enormous concerns of mistrust
against the Sudanese people, I think this is largely based on
previous events like the Cronulla riots," he [Mayor James
Treloar] said. (Dunkerley, 2006, p. 46)
Tamworth is a melting pot of cultures including migrants from
India, Italy, Lebanon and Greece--but Mr Treloar said it was the
recently arrived Sudanese who were causing angst [ . . . ] "They fly
out of Sudan, arrive in Sydney, pop on a plane and come to
Tamworth--and they come with trauma," he [Mayor Treloar] said.
"We acknowledge that, but we don't have the trauma counsellors
to help them. These people do not respect women. Most of the
people haven't been able to maintain employment because of
sexual harassment claims." (Saleh & Keene, 2006, p. 10)
All of the articles reviewed either included the mayor's
reference to the Cronulla riots, or to some conception of
"culture clash" or criminality of the Sudanese people. One
could argue therefore that the media highlighting of the may-
or's statement that equates bringing in Sudanese refugees to
Cronulla riots, which were themselves branded an epitome
of difficult race relations and racism in Australia, infers two
significant things about the council's decision. First, that the
mayor or the council in fact considered this as a decision
about race, not resources. The mayor's statement that "allow-
ing (the families) to move here could lead to a Cronulla riots-
type situation" implies that it will be inevitable that allowing
the families to settle in the town would result in race-based
social unrest or social problems (regardless of the availabil-
ity of resources). Second, the reference to a violent act
(Cronulla riots) implies racial stereotyping that constructs
the Sudanese refugees as a violent group. For purposes of
contextualization, it is worth pointing out that, at the core of
the Cronulla riots was a gang fight between the established
"Ozzie" gang and intruding new ethnic gangs, largely
Lebanese (who were harassing Australian European women
dressed in bikinis and calling them names). There is no evi-
dence that there were any Sudanese involved. Hence, linking
Sudanese families to a Cronulla risk (as the mayor did)
would seem to be wrong and the only connection is that they
are a different racial group from overseas so the mayor's
comments in this respect were patently racist and the framing
insofar as it accused the mayor of racism is accurate. Our
argument here, however, is not about the racist nature of the
mayor's comments, but rather the focus on those comments
to the exclusion of other non-racist comments that were
equally important and worth noting.
Not surprisingly then, only one of the reports (Norrie,
2006) made explicit reference to the mayor's utterances
about the council's concern regarding the lack of resources to
support the program, but even then, only one sentence was
8 SAGE Open
devoted to it: "The town did not have enough health and edu-
cation services to support the refugees, he said." This is a
clear indication of intent to frame the issue in racial terms on
the part of many. Here, we can talk about framing by exclu-
sion/omission (Entman, 2002) or framing by paying atten-
tion to only a small number of attributes at the expense of
others (McCombs & Estrada, 1997). Furthermore, in some
cases, the media reports even disputed the mayor's claim of
lack of resources:
Tamworth City Council voted to reject an offer by the department
to resettle the families, saying the town did not have the
resources to cope. But detractors say the decision was simply
racist, arguing the city has the resources to look after 50,000
extra people every year when it holds its famous country music
festival. ("Troubled Tamworth Gets Govt Support," 2007,
emphasis added)
Some reports even painted the mayor himself, not the
council as an entity, as the racist one:
While Treloar keeps running off at the mouth about resident
Sudanese, the Oxley Local Area commander, Superintendent
Tony Jefferson, gives the lie to the Mayor's words. He says
some have been charged with assault, traffic and domestic
matters--but "they do not stand out over any other ethnic group
in the community." Unrepentant, Treloar says: "If this is racist,
well so be it. Call me a racist then." (Murphy, 2006)
In some cases, the council's concern about lack of ser-
vices was subsumed under a more intense discussion about
concern with the "difference" of the problematized Sudanese
refugees:
Tamworth City Council has voted to refuse an offer by the
Immigration Department to resettle five refugee families from
the war-torn African nation. It feared cultural differences and a
lack of services could lead to increased violence in the city,
which is home to the world-renowned country music festival.
Mayor James Treloar said public submissions showed there was
a clear sense of mistrust in the town, after several existing
Sudanese residents were charged with driving offences and one
with sexual assault. (Dunkerley, 2006, emphasis added)
What seems clear from these reports then is that the coun-
cil's decision was not solely about race, as one report cites
the mayor: "It was a rejection of the government's program,
not of the Sudanese." This reaffirms Schulz's (2008) conten-
tion that "modern media practice includes selective processes
within the newsroom environment, and journalists abide by
certain clearly defined `news values' that prescribe the ele-
ments of a `good story.'Such elements generally include "the
sensational and the dramatic" (p. 224). It also aligns with the
view put forth by certain framing scholars that valenced
news frames provide an indication of what is inherently good
and positive or bad and negative in the news story (de Vreese
et al., 2011) while confirming that negative information
tends to have greater salience and memorability than infor-
mation which is positive (de Vreese et al., 2011; Johnson-
Cartee & Copeland, 1991; Lau, 1985).
Furthermore, where the mayor was quoted citing statistics
to validate the council's decision, these were presented as
either unsubstantiated or motivated by bigotry (Leader,
Diamond Valley News, 2007). This again points to framing
which is about highlighting and/or downplaying some bits of
information about an item to either make them more notice-
able, meaningful, or memorable to an audience on the one
hand, or less noticeable, less meaningful, or less memorable
on the other (Entman, 2002).
One other important observation about the reporting of
the council's reversal of the decision is how the media cover-
age magnified the role of external pressures (for example
from the church) or widespread outrage (for example from
the media "bashing," community outrage, etc.) that implied
that the "racist council" could not come to this decision on its
own, without these outside/external pressures. For example,
two of the articles included in this review reported on the role
of the churches in the reversal of the decision (Wilson, 2007a,
2007b)
Race/ing the Tamworth Case?
The media coverage of the issue was largely devoted to trying to
prove that residents of Tamworth (and, by extension, most
Australians) were racist, while failing to address the basic
question of why the local council was voting on the issue in the
first place and how they actually had the power to veto the
decision to locate the refugees in the town. (Allsop, 2007, p. 27)
The question therefore arises, given the foregone discussion
as well as Allsop's contention above, did the media "race"
the Tamworth council's decision? In other words, was the
Tamworth council's decision inherently racist, implying that
the media were simply reporting/exposing an act of racism?
As discussed already, clearly some of the reports privileged
racism above all else, giving the impression that racism was
at the core of the council's decision, as Mirko Bagaric (2006),
a social commentator (Geelong Advertiser), writes,
Racism, pure and simple is the only reason the council rejected
the re-settlement of the Sudanese families. Service provision has
nothing to do with it. Tamworth has 40,000 people.An additional
few families won't break the bank. In case it decides to stay
open, here are some lessons for the councillors. (p. 21)
Bagaric's statement does not leave room for any other expla-
nation for the council's decision, in spite of some other com-
mentators'claims that "the broader concerns of the council, in
tune with community sentiment, were that the existing gov-
ernment HRRP was ill-equipped to deliver full services to
newly arrived refugee families, threatening the longer-term
success of the pilot scheme" (Fraser, 2007, p. 17). The racism
frame adopted by the writer from the Geelong Advertiser and
Kwansah-Aidoo and Mapedzahama 9
the emphatic nature of the claim again fits well with the
observation made earlier that framing seeks to "promote a
particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral
evaluation and/or treatment recommendation for the item
described" (Entman, 2002, p. 391) and also tries to "empha-
size a particular cause of some phenomena" (Iyengar, 1991,
p. 11).
Nonetheless, we contend, that while the media did give
most of their attention to race (to the extent of almost disre-
garding any other basis for the decision), they did not "race
it." To start with, as Fraser (2007) notes,
The Tamworth incident was played out at a time of glaring
media profile for the Sudanese community in Australia. The
recent cases of convicted rapist Hakeem Hakeem, and of Taban
Gany, sentenced for drink driving causing serious injury, have
subjected the wider Sudanese population to columns of outrage
in the press and to simmering distrust from within sections of the
public. (p. 17)
One could argue therefore that the council's decision was
made in the context of attitudes and understandings emanat-
ing from discourses of the racially problematized Sudanese
refugee and that they were influenced by these discourses,
while at the same time contributing to them. As Fairclough
(1989) rightly points out, "Social conditions determine prop-
erties of discourse" (p. 9)" and "the language activity which
goes on in social contexts is not merely a reflection or expres-
sion of social processes and practices; it is part of those pro-
cesses and practices" (p. 23).
Media (Re)Producing the
Problematized (Sudanese) Refugee
Subject
An important (perhaps unintended) effect of the media's
framing of the Tamworth case as a racist event is how the
Sudanese subject was portrayed and positioned. The por-
trayal of the Sudanese refugee--oftentimes reported by
quoting the words of Tamworth city councilor and local pub-
lican, Robert Schofield--also propagated and perpetuated an
image of Sudanese subjectivity defined in terms of victim-
hood and abject poverty, thereby reinforcing the "us" and
"them" dichotomy:
Councillor and local publican Robert Schofield said: "These are
people escaping war and persecution. I'm sickened by the lack
of compassion." (Norrie, 2006, emphasis added)
We've got many, many volunteers up here. There's lots of
volunteer groups, they're only too pleased to help the Sudanese,
the poor souls, to get a new life back in Tamworth, Mr Schofield
told Southern Cross Radio. "We're a wealthy country and it's
only five families, and the poor souls have got absolutely
nothing. They come from a war-torn country where they've been
fighting there for 21 years, that's all they've known. (Geelong
Advertiser, 2007, emphasis added)
The emotive appeal of the excerpts above is evident,
("sickened by the lack of compassion"; "poor souls").
Further, the paternalistic overtones constructed and repro-
duced an "other" who is abjectly poor, hence different from
"us" a "wealthy country." Perhaps more important in the
excerpts is the references made to war and persecution.
These have more enduring and possibly even inimical conse-
quences for portrayal of the Sudanese subject--as victims,
who as Mayor Treloar argued, "fly out of Sudan, arrive in
Sydney, pop on a plane and come to Tamworth--and they
come with trauma, . . . [to a place where they] don't have the
trauma counsellors to help them" (Saleh & Keene, 2006).
Thus, rather than centre the resilience of Sudanese to survive
under crisis situations, such reporting instead associates
them with violence:
Few people could have greater claims to being given safe haven
in Australia than the Sudanese. Apart from a hiatus from 1972 to
1983, civil war has raged in southern Sudan since 1955. It has
claimed close to two million lives and displaced about four
million people. Despite international efforts to broker a peace
deal between rebel forces and government troops allied with
Arab janjaweed militia, the conflict in the Darfur region shows
little sign of abating. ("Shame Tamworth," 2006, p. 12)
Adopting the frames of war, persecution, and violence,
instead of resilience and survival in the discussion of
Sudanese subjectivity meant that attention was paid to only a
small number of attributes, which would subsequently ensure
that Sudanese refugees are seen only in a certain light
(McCombs & Estrada, 1997). Such reporting/framing rein-
forces Councilor Schofield's statement that war is "all they
[Sudanese refugees] have known." A consequence of such
reporting is that it can conjure up images and constructs of an
"other" sufficiently different from "us" (one who's only ever
known violence) that there is the possibility of a "clash of
civilisations." Not surprising then that the Sudanese subject
would be subsequently associated with violent behavior, as
Mayo Treloar argued. This "violent" subject, "different from
us" is highlighted in the reporting of the sentiments of a
Tamworth resident below:
A few doors up, a single mother shoos her young daughter
inside. She is a large woman, and stands barefoot on her dying
front lawn, pointing angrily at her neighbours. "Did you ask
them about the 11-year-old-girls that go into that house? It's
totally inappropriate," she says, her eyes welling with tears of
rage. "Did you ask them about driving off and not paying for
petrol? We don't do that. Why are the Aborigines scared of
them? They stand outside here on the street yabbering away on
their mobile phones. They just stare at you. Everybody's terrified
of them in the street. Why can't they just go back where they
came from?" (Murphy, 2006)
10 SAGE Open
The excerpt above not only frames the Tamworth case as
a racist event, but exposes the fear and uneasiness of some of
Tamworth residents with the Sudanese subject. We argue that
it is this fear and uneasiness that is behind such residents'
support of the council's decision: Allowing more Sudanese
refugees into the town meant the potential to increase vio-
lence (and crime) in an otherwise peaceful town.
Moreover, some of the reporting highlighted the Sudanese
refugee as not only "different," but also "raced":
Sudanese have black skin and are often Muslim but in every
meaningful respect they are the same as every other person in
Australia. That's a lesson civic leaders in Tamworth who have
refused to re-settle five Sudanese families need to have drilled
into them. Otherwise, their town, which has been voted
Australia's most friendly, might also get the mantle as the most
racist [ . . . ] Sure some Sudanese might express themselves in
slightly different ways, prefer different music and eat different
food but these no more differentiate them from the rest of us
than does the fact most of us follow different football teams.
(Bagaric, 2006, p. 17)
Such descriptions though purporting to be benign, serve
to subtly prop up "the structural relation in which `whiteness'
is defined against a homogenized Other constructed as black"
(Stratton, 2006, p. 676).
It is worth pointing out that the Sudanese refugee subject
who is re/produced in the reports is one who is silenced. In
analyzing the media reporting of the Tamworth case, what is
glaringly obvious is the lack of the Sudanese voice in most of
the reports, that is, the views/opinions of the Sudanese refu-
gees living in Tamworth in relation to the vote. In this sense,
the media not only reproduced the problematized Sudanese
refugee, it also silenced them, thereby committing what
Spivak (1994), calls an act of "epistemic violence" (p. 78).
Interestingly, of the few articles that included comments
from migrants of Sudanese background, none was from
Sudanese living in Tamworth. For example, Saleh and
Keene's article: "No More Refugees--Tamworth Mayor
Defends Vote to Slam the Gate" references the experiences
of Marial Fieg, residing in Newcastle. Similarly, Saleh's arti-
cles: "`Racist' Council's Apology of Sorts--Tamworth's
About-Face" and "Council Reconsiders: Tamworth Says
Sorry to its Sudan Refugees" also include "the voice" of
Sudanese refugees residing in Blacktown. Our contention
then is that the media failed in their role of serving as "a cru-
cial arena for challenging prevailing attitudes regarding the
many `others'" (Howard & Idriss, 2007, p. 2).
Discussion and Conclusion
This article has presented analyses of online print media
reporting of the Tamworth City council's 2006 decision (and
subsequent reversal of that decision) to refuse the resettle-
ment of five refugee families into the town, which gained
media attention and condemnation as an act of racism: a
decision based mainly on racial prejudice. Bullimore (1999)
writes that
The Australian media, like the media of many Westernised
countries, plays a significant role in not only providing
information about the society in which we live but also in
actively constructing for us a picture of that society. (p. 72)
What picture of society did the media paint in the
Tamworth case then? We have argued in this article that the
media framed the Tamworth Sudanese issue in particular
ways that would encourage the audience to see the Tamworth
Council's initial decision as racist and the whole issue as
being about racism (Delli Carpini & Keeter, 1997; Hacker &
Pierson, 2005). According to Gitlin (1980), "Media frames
are persistent patterns of cognition, interpretation, and pre-
sentation, of selection, emphasis and exclusion, by which
symbol-handlers routinely handle discourse" (p. 7). Our dis-
cussion here has shown that the media's selection, interpreta-
tion, and presentation of the events surrounding theTamworth
Council's decisions--rejection and subsequent reversal--
were meant to introduce patterns of cognition to the audience
that would more than likely make them see the case as being
about race and racism. Tamworth council was constructed in
the media coverage and discourses as having made a deci-
sion based on racial prejudice. In other words, through their
framing, the media painted a picture of a "racist" council, by
extension, a racist Tamworth, and by inference a racist coun-
try/rural Australia (at the very least).
The heavy mediation and the frame(s) adopted by the
media, which linked the Council's decisions to the wider
issue of race, racism, and racial harmony, turned what could
have easily passed for an innocuous everyday occurrence--a
Federal Government request to a City Council, and their neg-
ative response to the said request--into a media event "par
excellence" (Iyengar & Simon, 1997, p. 256). In so doing, the
media provided "a society-wide forum where values, norms,
and social structures were scrutinized, challenged, and cele-
brated" (Hunt, 1997, p. 410) in the name of so-called racial
moral outrage and harmonious race relations.
Moreover, when one applies Essed's concept of everyday
racism to the case, it is evident that the decision was an act of
everyday racism. Essed (1991) describes everyday racism as
the everyday manifestations and (re)production of systemic
inequality based on race and/or assumptions around race,
whether intended or unintended. Though other factors may/
could have influenced the decision-making and attitudes of
decision makers in this case, it is not far-fetched to argue that
the structural forces of racism, represented by attitudes and
understandings that permeate the circulating media dis-
courses around Sudanese refugees that problematize and
present them as the "racialized other," would have played a
role in influencing the council, acting in an everyday routine
situation, to take a decision that would discriminate against
the refugees. And as Stratton suggests, these attitudes and
Kwansah-Aidoo and Mapedzahama 11
understandings are so embedded in the everyday life of a
racialized Australian culture that its members don't even rec-
ognize themselves as making decisions based on a racialized
history (Stratton, 2006, p. 662).
Our conclusions about the media's framing notwithstand-
ing, it remains debatable whether the media reporting mir-
rored or portrayed community attitudes and perceptions
toward Sudanese refugees. While some may hail the report-
ing of the Tamworth case as an exposé of a case of racism, it
could also be critiqued as sensationalist reporting that pushed
the media agenda and exaggerated a race issue for the sake of
news (see, for example, Allsop, 2007; Fraser, 2007).
Moreover, as has been discussed in detail in this article,
the media, in their reporting still reproduced the current neg-
ative discourses of refugees that are not only paternalistic
and patronizing, but also problematize and pathologize refu-
gees. In so doing, the media became a site for the perpetua-
tion of negative stereotypes of Sudanese (and by extension
African) refugeehood that were in themselves racist. In our
view, what the media did qualifies as racial ramblings
because of the nature of their coverage and their insistent and
persistent focus on race and racism, and the presentation of
stereotypes, which while supposedly intended to be benign,
ultimately served as a platform for (re)producing and enhanc-
ing both everyday and systemic racism. The analyses in this
article illustrates that the Tamworth Case contained base
materials for different frames and that there was an opportu-
nity to offer multiple explanations as to why the Tamworth
Council made their initial decision to reject the Federal
Government's request, but that did not happen. This article
therefore shows that explanations offered in news coverage
of such issues while at least partially inherent, are influenced
to a great extent by "social, cultural, and historical forces
influencing the institution and practice of journalism" (Park,
Holody, & Zhang, 2012, p. 477).
In terms of value, this article has provided insights into an
issue that is of politico-cultural significance within the
Australian society--the issue of race, racism, and racial rela-
tions. Given the on-going discussions about racism in
Australia and how to deal with it, and also public discourses
about multiculturalism as official cultural policy, the discus-
sions in this article help us to understand the mass media's
role in highlighting racism as a problem for public and politi-
cal concern while providing valuable insights into how the
media can act as a double-edged sword: helping to unearth
and fight racism, thereby championing racial harmony on
one hand, while providing a platform for (re)producing racial
stereotypes and subsequently everyday racism.
The article is also important because it has shown that
news frames can affect/influence the decision making of
elected bodies (in this case, cause a change of mind/decision
by the Tamworth Council), thereby confirming research
findings that suggest that people who are moderately or most
politically aware are more responsive to media framing (see,
for example, de Vreese et al., 2011; Druckman & Nelson,
2003; Lecheler & deVreese, 2012; Slothuus, 2008; Sniderman
& Theriault, 2004). Also by providing some understanding of
the "dynamics between media coverage and what people
make of the issues presented to them on one hand, and how
this coverage interacts with societal factors to produce
effects" (Kwansah-Aidoo, 2001, p. 364), the discussions and
revelations here can inform discussions around the future
direction of government refugee settlement policy. It can also
help in designing programs that seek to gain both public and
council support for such policy, as well as helping in discus-
sions of a more robust multicultural policy for Australia. Last
but not least, the worth of this article can be seen in the way
in which it has shown why despite all the talk about racism
and the efforts at ending it, race and racial matters continue to
be issues of everyday concern. Our discussions have exposed
the subtle and yet persistent way in which racism reproduces
itself in the Australian society, through seemingly objective
and benevolent ways of reporting the "other."
To sum up, we revisit the question in our title and con-
clude based on our discussions so far, that the media through
their intense coverage and the negatively valenced frames
that they used in their articles/stories, turned the Tamworth
Sudanese Resettlement Case of 2006 into a media event
(Iyengar & Simon, 1997; Kwansah-Aidoo, 2003). We also
contend that in the process of doing so they engaged in
reporting, which inadvertently served to enhance stereotypi-
cal ways of viewing the migrant Sudanese, and by extension
African "other," thereby contributing to the reproduction of
both everyday and systemic racism (Essed, 1991; Stratton,
2006) and thus qualifying it as racial rumblings.

Author Biographies
Kwamena Kwansah-Aidoo, PhD, is associate professor of mar-
keting/public relations at Swinburne University of Technology. His
research interests span across the fields of public relations, media,
and new communication technologies, and has published several
refereed journal articles, book reports, and chapters in these areas.
He is currently working on two emerging streams on race, racializa-
tion, and the experiences of the new African diaspora in Australia,
and the budding video film industry in Anglophone West Africa.
Virginia Mapedzahama has a PhD in sociology from the
University of South Australia and is currently working on the
Challenging Racism Project (CRP) at Western Sydney University.
Her research focuses on understanding the social construction of all
categories of difference, meanings attached to this difference, how
it is signified, lived, and its implications for those assigned differ-
ence. She explores this interest in the context of migration, dias-
pora, blackness, race, racism, and ethnicity in Australia.
