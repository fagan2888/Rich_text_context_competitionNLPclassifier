Abstract: Parents and offspring have asymmetrical preferences with respect to mate
choice. So far, several areas of disagreement have been identified, including beauty, family
background, and sexual strategies. This article proposes that mating age constitutes another
area of conflict, as parents desire their children to initiate mating at a different age than the
offspring desire it for themselves. More specifically, the hypothesis is tested that
individuals prefer for their offspring to start having sexual relationships at a later age than
they prefer for themselves to do so. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that individuals prefer
to marry at a later age than they prefer their offspring to marry. Finally, the hypothesis is
tested that parents prefer their daughters to marry at an earlier age and start sexual
relationships later than their sons. Evidence from two independent studies employing 751
British parents provides support for all three hypotheses.

Introduction
Trivers (1974) originally hypothesized that parents and offspring are in
disagreement over mating decisions. In particular, Trivers argued that as parents and
offspring are not genetically identical, offspring will tend to make mate choices which
maximize their fitness, but not necessarily the fitness of their parents. Recently, a number
of papers have attempted to identify specific areas of disagreement over mating between
parents and offspring.
In particular, Apostolou (2007a) hypothesized that offspring value the genetic
quality of their spouses more than their parents value the genetic quality of their in-laws.
The reason being that the coefficient of relatedness of parents to children is 0.5, but the
coefficient of relatedness of grandparents to grandchildren is only 0.25. Accordingly,
individuals benefit more by a spouse than an in-law of good genetic quality. Consistent
with this prediction, Apostolou (2008a) found that individuals value good looks, a proxy of
genetic quality, significantly more in a spouse than in an in-law. Similarly, Buunk, Park,
Parent-offspring conflict over mating
and Dubbs (2008) found that individuals consider potential partners who are unattractive
more unacceptable for themselves than they think their parents would consider them for
their children.
Furthermore, it has been argued that historically a preference for a mating candidate
with good family background increased the fitness of the parents more than it increased the
fitness of their offspring (Apostolou, 2008b; Buunk, Park, and Dubbs, 2008; Trivers,
1974). In accordance with this hypothesis, Apostolou (2008b) found that individuals value
good family background more in an in-law than in a spouse. Similarly, Buunk, Park, and
Dubbs (2008) found that individuals consider potential partners who have a bad family
background less unacceptable for themselves than they think their parents would consider
them for their children.
Conflict is not confined only to beauty and family background but extends also to
religious background, personality traits, and mating strategies (Apostolou, 2008a, 2008b,
2009; Buunk, Park, and Dubbs, 2008; Park, Dubbs, and Buunk, 2008). The purpose of this
paper is to contribute to this line of research by providing evidence that mating age
constitutes another area of parent-offspring disagreement.
Parent-Offspring Conflict over Mating Age
Asymmetrical interests between parents and children induce the former to control
the mating decisions of the latter (Apostolou, 2007b, 2010). Parents are able to do so
because they are in control of parental investment and because they are physically stronger
than their offspring (Alexander, 1974; Apostolou, 2007b). However, the strength of
parental control over mating is inversely related to offspring's age (Apostolou, 2007b,
2010). In particular, as children grow older, they become more independent from parental
investment. For instance, in foraging societies older individuals are more experienced
hunters and more productive gatherers (e.g., the !Kung; see Lee, 1979), while in
agropastoral societies, older individuals may obtain their own land and cattle (e.g., the
Somali; see Lewis, 1962). Moreover, as offspring age they become physically stronger than
their parents, who grow older and weaker and can no longer impose their choices on them
by means of physical strength.
Consequently, as their children grow up, parents' capacity to control their mating
decisions substantially decreases. Accordingly, parents would like their offspring to get
married at a younger age, before they become independent, while the offspring would
prefer to get married later so as to become more independent from their parents, and thus,
more able to exercise their own mate choice. Finally, early marriage reduces the time space
that offspring have to engage in premarital sexual relationships, which is beneficial to
parents (see below). It is predicted then that individuals prefer to marry later than they
prefer their offspring to marry.
Furthermore, the initiation of sexual relationships may result in the development of
feelings of love or pregnancy, which may seriously compromise parental attempts to
control the mating behavior of their children. For instance, in rural Greece during the last
century, in the case of pregnancy, the couple had to get married even if the groom or the
bride did not comply with the parents' standards (Friedl, 1962). Therefore, parents would
prefer their offspring to delay sexual relationships as these may commit them to a

Parent-offspring conflict over mating
disadvantageous marriage. On these grounds, it is further predicted that individuals prefer
to start having sexual relationships at an earlier age than they would like their offspring to
do so.
Moreover, parental investment is asymmetrical, with females diverting more
investment to their offspring than males (Trivers, 1972). Males seek access to the
reproductive capacity of the female, enabling parents to acquire more benefits from
controlling their daughters' mating decisions (Apostolou, 2007b, 2010; Perilloux,
Fleischman, and Buss, 2008). Also, a sexual liaison may commit a daughter's parental
investment (i.e. pregnancy) in the mutual offspring of a man whom her parents do not
approve (Perilloux et al., 2008). Similarly, if a sexual relationship before marriage ends up
in pregnancy, the father may not always be persuaded to stay. The pregnant woman in turn
is left alone with her parents to shoulder the weight of raising the child.
In addition, due to paternal uncertainty, males place a premium on the chastity of
the female (Buss, 2003; Buss and Schmitt, 1993). Thus, early sexual liaisons can damage
the status of the female and the prospects of her parents to arrange a good marriage (e.g., to
make an alliance with a desirable family). Finally, as youth is valued more in women than
in men (Buss, 2003), a daughter who is married young can attract a higher quality mate
than a daughter who is married at a later age.
For these reasons, parents should be more interested to marry their daughters early
to men of their own choice and prevent them from having sexual relationships before
marriage. Accordingly, it is predicted that parental preferences are contingent upon the sex
of the offspring, as parents prefer their daughters to marry earlier and start sexual
relationships later than their sons.
To test these hypotheses two studies have been conducted. Study 1 examines
differences in preferences over marital age, and Study 2 examines differences in
preferences over the initiation of sexual activity.
Study 1
Materials and Methods
Participants
A total of 392 participants, 177 women and 215 men, all British, completed the
online survey. The mean age of male participants was 50.14 years (SD = 11.91) and the
mean age of female participants was 46.1 years (SD = 10.24). A private company was
employed specializing in recruiting participants for online research in psychology. The
participants were selected from a large database of people willing to participate in online
psychological research and have registered through the company's web site. To take part in
the survey, participants had to be parents with at least one child. Parents had on average
0.96 (SD = 0.85) male children and 0.92 (SD = 0.91) female children. The mean age of
male children was 14.82 years (SD = 13.42) and the mean age of female children was 14.58
years (SD = 13.73). Most participants were married (74%), followed by those in a
relationship (10.7%), divorced (8.2%), single (4.1%), and engaged (2%). All parents
received payment for completing the survey in the form of credit (about $2) that can be

Procedure
The survey consisted of two parts. In the first part, demographic data were
collected: sex, age, nationality, marital status, number of daughters, number of sons, age of
the oldest male child, and age of the oldest female child. Participants were then asked to
consider a hypothetical scenario. Arranged marriage is the commonest type of marriage
across human societies and was most likely common during human evolutionary time
(Apostolou, 2007a, 2010). Since arranging the marriage of their offspring was probably a
natural act for parents, a scenario where parents had to choose spouses for their children
was selected for the purposes of this study:
You have two children, one male and one female, who have recently entered
puberty. You live in a society where marriages are arranged and it is your
duty as a parent, through negotiations with other parents, to find an
appropriate spouse for both your daughter and son.
Next, the participants were asked to indicate the age they consider appropriate for
their daughters and sons to get married. In the second part, participants were given the
following scenario: "You have recently entered puberty. You live in a society where
marriages are not arranged and it is up to you to find a husband or a wife." The participants
were asked to indicate the age they consider appropriate for them to get married. The order
of presentation of the two scenarios was randomized between participants.
In-Law vs. Mating Preferences Comparisons
This study employs the method used by Apostolou (2008a, 2008b, 2009) to
examine parent-offspring conflict over mating. In particular, sexually mature individuals
who have children were selected as participants because they can act both as parents and
mate seekers. In addition, a within-participants design has been employed, because it
enables a better control for alternative explanations based on social learning. A between-
participants design inevitably involves a generation gap between parents and offspring,
thus, any potential differences in the responses between the two can be attributed to
differences in socialization in each generation.
Moreover, the ratings of the female participants for themselves were compared with
the respective ratings for their daughters, and the ratings of the male participants for
themselves were compared with the respective ratings for their sons. Comparisons between
female participants and sons, and between male participants and daughters were not made,
since the results from this analysis would fail to distinguish differences in the ratings
between sexes (men versus women) from differences in the ratings between parents and
offspring.
Results
In order to identify the differences between in-law and mating preferences, a series

Parent-offspring conflict over mating
of paired-sample t-tests was conducted between self and daughter and between self and son
ratings on the marital age item. The results are summarized in Table 1.
To begin with, female participants prefer to marry later (M = 24.92, SD = 3.22) than
they prefer their daughters to marry (M = 23.88, SD = 2.90), t(168) = -5.58, p < .001 (two-
tailed), d = .34. Furthermore, male participants prefer to marry later (M = 25.26, SD = 3.89)
than they prefer their sons to marry (M = 24.63, SD = 3.35), t(211) = -3.32, p < .01 (two-
tailed), d = .17.
Moreover, in order to examine whether age preferences are contingent upon the sex
of the offspring, a series of paired-sample t-tests was conducted between sons and
daughters. The results indicate that parents want their female offspring to marry earlier (M
= 23.46, SD = 2.92) than their male offspring (M = 25.12, SD = 3.37), t(391) = -14.49,
p < .001 (two-tailed), d = .21.

All participants in this study were parents, so inevitably their mean age is not
representative of the age of an individual at first marriage. If preferences are affected by
age, the true extent of the parent-offspring conflict may be overrated or underrated in this
analysis. To examine whether this is the case, the marital age items were regressed on the
age of the participants. No significant effects were found. However, we should be cautious
of this result as there were very few participants of a younger age in the sample.
A possible scenario is that parental preferences differ according to the age of their
offspring. More specifically, parental preferences may be `activated' only when the
offspring enter puberty and sexual relationships and marriage become possibilities. To test
whether this is the case, a new independent variable was created which is based on the age
of the participants' children, and has four levels (both children younger than 14, both-
children 14 or above, only male children 14 or above, only female children 14 or above).
The age 14 was selected because by this age most children have entered puberty (Blondell,
Foster, and Dave, 1999). A one-way ANOVA was performed on each item of the survey
with the age of the offspring as an independent variable. No significant results were found.
A drawback of this method is that it potentially conflates the effects of age and
gender, while it uses a cut-off of 14 years of age, which may or may not be relevant in real

life. For this reason, in order to examine whether the age of the offspring affects ratings, an
alternative method has also been applied. In particular, the age of the oldest male child was
regressed on parents' preferences for their sons, and the age of the oldest female child was
regressed on the parents' preferences for their daughters. All regression results came
insignificant.
Not all parents in the sample had children of both sexes. To examine whether the
sex of the offspring affects parents' ratings, a one-way ANOVA was conducted in each
item of the study with the sex of the participants' children as an independent factor (three
levels: male children, female children, children of both sexes). No significant results were
produced, indicating that the parents' ratings are not affected by the sex of their children.
Finally, not all parents in the sample had an equal number of children. Thus, in order to
find whether the number of children affects ratings, the number of children participants had
was regressed on marital age preferences. No significant results were found.
Study 2
Materials and Methods
Participants
A total of 359 participants, 198 women and 161 men, all British, completed the
online survey. The mean age of male participants was 41.78 years (SD = 11.07) and the
mean age of female participants was 37 years (SD = 9.2). A private company was
employed specializing in recruiting participants for online research in psychology. To take
part in the survey, participants had to be parents with at least one child. Parents had on
average 1.18 (SD = 1.08) male children and 1.07 (SD = 0.89) female children. The mean
age of male children was 10.32 years (SD = 9.32) and the mean age of female children was
9.83 years (SD = 9.65). Most participants were married (68%), followed by those in a
relationship (15.6%), engaged (6.1%), divorced (5.8%), and single (4.2%). All parents
received payment for completing the survey in the form of credit (about $2) that can be
used to purchase goods from online stores.
Procedure
Although arranged marriage is common in contemporary non-Western societies and
most probably was also common during human evolutionary time, it is not common in
modern Britain (it is only practiced by certain minority groups). Thus, the scenario of
arranged marriage used in Study 1 can potentially sound implausible to participants. For
this reason, in this study participants were asked directly about their preferences.
More specifically, the survey consisted of two parts. In the first part, demographic
data were collected: sex, age, nationality, marital status, number of daughters, number of
sons, age of the oldest male child, and age of the oldest female child. Then, the following
scenario was given: "You have two children, one male and one female, who are not
married and have recently entered puberty." The participants were then asked to indicate
the age which they consider appropriate for their daughters and sons to start having sexual
relationships and the age they consider appropriate for their daughters and sons to get

married.
In the second part, participants were given the following scenario: "You are not
married and you have recently entered puberty," and they were asked to indicate the age
they consider appropriate for them to start having sexual relationships and the age they
consider appropriate for them to get married. The order of presentation of the two scenarios
was randomized between participants.
Results
In order to identify the differences between in-law and mating preferences, a series
of paired-sample t-tests was conducted between self and daughter and between self and son
ratings on each age item. The results are summarized in Table 2.
Mating age preferences vary significantly based on whether the participants act as
mate seekers or parents. More specifically, female participants prefer to start having sexual
relationships earlier (M = 17.78, SD = 2.06) than they prefer their daughters to do so (M =
18.26, SD = 2.05), t(197) = 3.90, p < .001, (two-tailed), d = .23. Similarly, male
participants prefer to start having sexual relationships earlier (M = 17.68, SD = 2.07) than
they prefer their sons to do so (M = 18.04, SD = 2.50), t(160) = 2.91, p < .01, (two-tailed),
d = .14.
With respect to the marital age, female participants prefer to marry later (M = 24.05,
SD = 3.01) than they prefer their daughters to marry (M = 23.58, SD = 2.84), t(197) =
-2.85, p < .01, (two-tailed), d = .16. Furthermore, male participants prefer to marry later (M
= 24.06, SD = 3.70) than they prefer their sons to marry (M = 23.83, SD = 3.64). However,
this difference does not pass the significance level.
Moreover, in order to examine whether age preferences are contingent upon the sex
of the offspring, a series of paired-sample t-tests was conducted between sons and
daughters. The results indicate that parents prefer their female offspring to start sexual
relationships later (M = 18.28, SD = 2.08) than their sons (M = 18.03, SD = 2.28), t(358) =
3.14, p < .01, (two-tailed), d = .12. Conversely, parents want their female offspring to
marry earlier (M = 23.41, SD = 3.03) than their male offspring (M = 24.22, SD = 3.52),
t(358) = -7.67, p < .001, (two-tailed), d = .25.

To identify whether preferences are affected by age, the mating age items were
regressed on the age of the participants. No significant effects were found. Moreover, to
examine whether parental preferences differ according to the age of their offspring, a one-
way ANOVA was performed on each item of the survey with the age of the offspring as an
independent variable. No significant results were found. Similarly, the age of the oldest
male child was regressed on parents' preferences for their sons, and the age of the oldest
female child was regressed on the parents' preferences for their daughters. All regression
results came insignificant. Also, to examine whether the sex of the offspring affects
parents' ratings, a one-way ANOVA was conducted in each item of the study with the sex
of the participants' children as an independent factor (three levels: male children, female
children, children of both sexes). No significant results were produced. Finally, the number
of participants' children was regressed on their preferences items without producing any
significant results.
Discussion
Consistent with the original hypothesis, it is found that individuals prefer for their
offspring to start having sexual relationships at a later age than they prefer for themselves
to do so. It is also found that participants prefer to marry later than they prefer for their
children to marry. Moreover, it is found that parents prefer their female offspring to marry
earlier and start sexual relationships later than their male offspring. Note that this
asymmetry in preferences is due to parents being more interested in controlling the mating

Parent-offspring conflict over mating
behavior of their daughters than of their sons, and not due to parents being interested in
delaying their sons' marriage and accelerating their sexual relationships. In other words,
parents do not prefer a longer period of time between the onset of sexual activity and
marriage for sons; they simply prefer a shorter period for daughters.
Parents and offspring disagree over specific traits, such as beauty and family
background, because these preferences give them direct benefits. For instance, by
preferring a more attractive individual than their parents prefer, offspring increase their
chance to find a spouse of superior genetic quality. On the other hand, asymmetrical
preferences with respect to mating age give indirect benefits to each party. For example, a
preference to marry later than their parents would prefer enables offspring to marry later.
This may give them more freedom over mate choice, which in turn increases the
probability of finding attractive spouses, giving them genetic benefits. Consequently,
asymmetrical mating age preferences arise because parents and offspring have different
preferences for traits which give them asymmetrical benefits. If all traits were equally
beneficial to parents and offspring, asymmetrical preferences over mating age would not
have evolved.
The results of this study allow us to make a number of predictions about modern
family dynamics and the institution of marriage. More specifically, we expect parents to
attempt to persuade or advise their offspring to marry earlier than they desire. For instance,
parents may keep reminding their children that they are old enough and it is now time for
them to settle down and marry. Parents are also expected to attempt to control the mate
choices of their teenage children, and to physically restrict their mating activities (e.g., by
grounding) so as to prevent them from having early sexual relationships. Such control
should be asymmetrical, as parents are likely to be more concerned about the mating
behavior of their female offspring, put more pressure on their daughters to marry early and
prevent them from having sexual relationships before marriage (see Goode, 1964; Perilloux
et al., 2008).
All human societies practice marriage, but in certain cultural settings the timing of
marriage is close to the initiation of sexual relationships, while in others it is much further
apart. This study finds evidence that parents prefer their offspring, and particularly the
female ones, to delay sexual relationships and to accelerate marriage. On this basis, it can
be predicted that in societies where parents are influential over the mating decisions of their
offspring, initiation of sexual relationships and marriage timing will converge, particularly
for women: individuals under parental influence will tend to marry earlier and start sexual
relationships later. For instance, among the Nandi in Kenya, where parents determine to a
large extent the mate choices of their children, a marriage is arranged for a girl as soon as
she reaches puberty (Langley, 1979). On the other hand, in cultures where parents are not
as influential over the mate choices of their offspring (e.g., Western societies), initiation of
sexual relationships and marital age tend to diverge.
The close timing of marriage and sexual relationships in certain societies raises the
question of whether it is meaningful to treat the two as distinct variables. The answer is yes
for two main reasons: First, close timing of marriage and sexual relationships takes place
only in a minority of societies. More specifically, this is more frequent in agropastoral
societies where parents are more influential over the mating decisions of their offspring
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 8(3). 2010. -373-
Parent-offspring conflict over mating
(Apostolou, 2010). Among foragers, it is a rare occurrence for virginity to be expected in
marriage (e.g., the !Kung; see Lee, 1979). Second, in most societies, irrespectively of their
subsistence type, men usually marry years after they have reached sexual maturity (Goode,
1964; Stephens, 1963; Whyte, 1978).
A limitation of this study is that participants had to rate traits on the basis of a
hypothetical scenario, which required participants to indicate their preferences as if they
were younger. This inevitably results into regressing to a younger age that, in turn, can be
subject to distorting memory effects. However, it is rather unlikely that such effects would
bias the data in a manner consistent with our hypotheses; thus, it is reasonable to suggest
that the results of the study are due to asymmetrical preferences with respect to age rather
than distorting memory effects.
Another concern is that the within-participants design may mask the true extent of
the parent-offspring disagreement, because with this method in-law and mate preferences
are likely to merge. For instance, in some cases the within-participants means are
significantly different but very close together. Moreover, the offspring may consider it
acceptable to have sexual relationships before marriage, but their parents may consider it
unacceptable for their children to have sexual relationships outside marriage; this may
create a source of conflict between the two. This study does not test this possibility, which
should be addressed in future research. Finally, this work is limited to a single culture (i.e.,
British), and future research should attempt to replicate these findings for different and
diverse cultures, an endeavor that would enhance the evolutionary hypotheses of this study.
Overall, this research attempts to further advance our knowledge on the parent-
offspring conflict over mating. Parents and offspring are not genetically identical, and
consequently, do not have identical interests with respect to mating. To serve their interests
each party has evolved different preferences with respect to mating age.
