Background. The purpose of this analysis was to examine the association of sociodemographic variables and health-
related conditions with 5-year declines in cognitive function among Mexican American elderly persons.
Methods. The cognitive function of 1759 participants was assessed by using the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) in 1993/1994 and again in 1998/1999. Cognitive decline was defined by two sets of criteria: (1) a drop to 17 or
below on the MMSE at follow-up, and (2) a decline of at least three points, the mean change in MMSE scores among re-
spondents who obtained scores at or above the 5th percentile distribution at baseline.
Results. Cognitive decline was significantly associated with sociodemographic variables including age, education,
marital status, and household composition. In addition, respondents with reported vision impairment, stroke, and diabe-
tes were at increased risk for cognitive decline after controlling for multiple potential confounders.
Conclusion. Although age and education have been reported as the more salient predictors of cognitive deterioration,
other sociodemographic and several medical conditions including stroke and diabetes should be considered as part of
cognitive aging studies among Mexican American elders.
ECENT literature has focused on understanding fac-
tors predicting decline in cognitive function among
normal older adults (1足4). This research has focused pre-
dominantly upon non-Hispanic white elders. Little attention
has been paid to other ethnic minority groups, particularly
Hispanic elders. The Hispanic population of the United
States is one of the fastest growing minorities and is ex-
pected to surpass African Americans to become the largest
minority group sometime this decade (5). Understanding
cognitive decline in this expanding population is of major
public health importance (2,6).
Data from longitudinal studies have suggested that, in
general, older age (7), lower education level (8), higher ini-
tial levels of cognitive performance (9,10), and higher de-
pressive symptomatology (11,12) are associated with higher
rates of cognitive decline. In addition, several studies have
suggested that certain medical conditions, such as hyperten-
sion (13), stroke (14), diabetes (4), and hearing and visual
impairment (15), are associated with cognitive decline and
indirectly with the incidence of possible dementia.
Although the aforementioned findings may generally
hold for non-Hispanic whites, it is unclear as to how these
findings can be generalized to other subpopulations, such as
Mexican Americans. A limited number of studies have
found a significantly higher prevalence of cognitive impair-
ment among Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic whites
(4,16). In a recent study of older Mexican Americans, Black
and colleagues (17) documented significant associations be-
tween sociodemographic variables, comorbid disease states,
and cognitive performance. These findings, however, were
based on cross-sectional data.
The purpose of the present study was to extend the earlier
work reported by Black and colleagues (17) by examining
cognitive decline in a large probability-based community
sample of older Mexican Americans residing in the South-
western United States. Specifically, we are interested in ex-
amining (1) changes in cognitive function in older Mexican
Americans over a 5-year period; (2) demographic variables
such as age, gender, education, immigration status, house-
hold composition, and marital status that may predict cogni-
tive decline; and (3) whether a group of health-related con-
ditions measured at baseline can predict cognitive decline at
5-year follow-up. That is, do health-related characteristics,
including depressive symptoms and medical conditions, add
to the prediction of cognitive decline after the effects of so-
ciodemographic variables have been controlled?
METHODS
Sample
Data used in this study were part of the Hispanic Estab-
lished Population for the Epidemiological Study of the El-
derly (Hispanic EPESE), a population-based survey of older
Mexican Americans residing in the Southwestern United
States. A full description of the rationale, methods, and sub-
ject characteristics of this study can be found elsewhere
(18). Area probability sampling yielded a sample of 3050
Mexican Americans aged 65 and older representing approx-
imately 500,000 older Mexican Americans living in Texas,
New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and California in
1993/1994. At 5-year follow-up, 628 subjects were de-
ceased, 312 were lost to follow-up, and 127 refused to be re-

interviewed. In addition, 224 subjects were excluded from
the analyses because they were unable to answer one or
more cognitive-related items as a result of physical limita-
tions (such as being too ill, being blind, or being impaired
by arthritis). Thus, the final sample consisted of 1759 sub-
jects with complete data at both baseline and follow-up. All
interviews were conducted either in Spanish or English, de-
pending on the respondent's preference, by interviewers who
were fully bilingual and predominantly of Hispanic origin.
Measures
The primary outcome measure was the Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE). The MMSE is among the most fre-
quently used cognitive screening measures in studies of
older adults (19). This instrument has been used extensively
in community surveys, nursing home studies, longitudinal
studies of aging, and in clinical investigation (20). Using
conventional cut-points, the MMSE has consistently yielded
correct classification rates of 80% to 90% when compared
with physician assessments of cognitive impairment and de-
mentia (21).
The English and Spanish versions of the MMSE were
adopted from the Diagnostic Interview Scale (DIS) used in
prior community surveys (22). This Spanish version of the
MMSE has met standard criteria for development of trans-
lated tests, including formal translation, back-translation,
and consensus by committee for final item content. Addi-
tionally, the Spanish MMSE has been successfully used in
community surveys of Mexican Americans (23). Owing to
reported poor item equivalency, however, the serial-sevens
item was not used in the present version. Bilingual inter-
viewers were thoroughly trained in administration and scoring
of the MMSE, both through workshops and videotaped in-
struction. As has been recommended in the literature (24), re-
sponses of "don't know" and refusals were counted as errors.
In addition to sociodemographic characteristics (gender,
age, education, literacy, marital status, immigration status,
and household composition), respondents were also as-
sessed for the presence of depressive symptomatology using
the self-reported Center for Epidemiological Studies足Depres-
sion (CES-D) scale (25). A score of 16 or greater on the
CES-D was used to delineate high levels of depressive
symptoms. Respondents were also measured for sensory
impairment in terms of hearing and vision. Hearing was as-
sessed using the 10-item Hearing Handicap Inventory for
the Elderly足Screening version (HHIE-S) (26). Scores ranged
from 0 to 40 with 10 indicating no impairment. Near vi-
sion was measured using cards, each with seven-digit num-
bers of three different type sizes: 7-, 10-, and 23-point. Sub-
jects held these cards at least 7 inches from their eyes and
were then asked to read the numbers. Participants who
could only read the 23-point were considered to have near-
vision impairment. Functional distance vision was mea-
sured using a modified Snellen test employing directional
Es at 4 meters to assess acuity from 20/40 to 20/200 (27).
Those with vision worse than 20/60 to 20/200 were consid-
ered impaired. In addition, self-reported medical diseases
were assessed by asking respondents if they had ever been
told by a doctor that they had any of the following condi-
tions: diabetes, stroke, and hypertension.
Because there are no established normative guidelines for
determining cognitive decline, we used two sets of criteria
to identify individuals who had declined to severe impair-
ment (Criterion-1) and individuals with a more moderate
impairment decline (Criterion-2). Criterion-1 was defined
by using a fixed MMSE cutoff score derived from the litera-
ture on experimental and clinical populations (28), and re-
spondents were classified as "cognitively impaired" if their
MMSE scores at baseline were less than 18. At 5-year fol-
low-up, "unimpaired" subjects at baseline were categorized
as having "declined" if their MMSE scores had dropped to
less than 18 points, indicating a decline to severe impair-
ment.
Analyses using Criterion-1 are based on subjects with
scores higher than 17 at baseline (n  1716), as opposed to
the entire total sample. Of the 1716 subjects with baseline
MMSE scores of 18 or higher, 314 declined to 17 or below
at follow-up. Of those who declined, 115 had baseline
scores between 18 and 21, 115 had scores between 22 and
25, and 84 had scores between 26 and 30 (see Table 1 for
distribution of cutoff scores at baseline and at follow-up).
Criterion-2 used a cutoff MMSE score based on the dis-
tribution of scores from the sample itself rather than on cut-
off scores derived from other non-Hispanic populations. We
adapted the NINCDS-ADRDA Work Group's work in de-
termining cognitive impairment when respondents' scores
fell at or below the 5th percentile of their normal control
group (3,29). We extended this control group guideline to
include our entire total population sample and to identify in-
dividuals with more moderate cognitive decline relative to
others within their own group. The sensitivity and specific-
ity of this criterion have been examined and reported in an
earlier study (11). Based on the 95th percentile distribution,
1689 participants in our study obtained MMSE scores of 18
or higher at baseline, and the mean change in MMSE scores
from baseline to 5-year follow-up for this group was 3.35
points. Hence, respondents were considered to have cogni-
tively declined if, at follow-up, their scores had decreased
by at least 3 points since baseline. Under Criterion-2, 921
subjects were classified as having cognitively declined, and
of these, 24 had baseline scores less than 18, 107 had scores
between 18 and 21, 262 had scores between 22 and 25, and
528 had scores between 26 and 30. Table 1 also shows the
distribution of cutoff scores using this criterion.

COGNITIVE DECLINE AMONG MEXICAN ELDERS M183
Analyses
Multiple logistic regression models were fit to calculate
odds ratios for the relationship between selected noncogni-
tive variables at baseline and cognitive scores at follow-up.
Two separate logistic equations were used to model the two
dichotomous measures of cognitive change. Predictors in-
cluded age, gender, education, marital status, immigration
status, and household composition (i.e., number of people
living in the household). After controlling for these vari-
ables, baseline depressive symptoms and selected health
conditions were then added to each model. Descriptions of
baseline variables are given in Table 2. The dependent vari-
able was the presence or absence of cognitive decline (as
defined by Criteria 1 and 2) at follow-up.
RESULTS
Criterion-1 Data
The results of the logistic regression models are pre-
sented in Table 3. With increasing age, there was a signifi-
cant increase in the odds of cognitive decline during the
5-year study interval. Subjects with less than 5 years of edu-
cation were significantly more likely to experience decline.
Compared with participants who were living alone, respon-
dents who lived with others had almost twice the odds of
experiencing decline. Married respondents were less likely
to decline. Gender and immigration status were not signifi-
cant predictors of decline.
We next added diabetes, stroke, hypertension, hearing
and vision impairment, and depressive symptoms to the
analysis. Results indicated that baseline diabetes, stroke,
and near-vision impairment were significant predictors of
decline. Hypertension, hearing impairment, distant vision
impairment, and depressive symptoms were not predictive
of decline as defined by Criterion-1. Furthermore, including
these health characteristics did not alter the significant ef-
fects of age, education, marital status, and household com-
position.
Criterion-2 Data
We conducted additional analyses to examine whether
sociodemographic and health-related variables would pre-
dict cognitive change among respondents who had dropped
at least three points or more on the MMSE since baseline.
Older age and lower education were significant predictors
of decline whereas gender, marital status, immigration status,
and household composition were not (see Table 3). Under
Criterion-1, subjects who had a history of stroke or diabetes
were found to decline over the follow-up interval. However,
under Criterion-2, diabetes and stroke did not significantly
predict decline. After adjusting for sociodemographic and
health characteristics, elderly persons with near-vision im-
pairment remained significantly more likely to decline than
those without near-vision impairment. Finally, respondents
reporting high levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D 16)
were significantly more likely to decline than those report-
ing lower levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D 16).
Further analyses were conducted to examine the interaction
effects of age with education, stroke, diabetes, hyperten-
sion, and depressive symptoms. None proved to be signifi-
cant for either Criterion-1 or Criterion-2 analyses.
DISCUSSION
In this analysis, we examined the effect of noncognitive
variables on cognitive decline over a 5-year period using
data from the Hispanic EPESE. The most noteworthy find-
ing evident in the present study is the different predictive
patterns across the two criteria. Results for both criteria in-
dicated that gender and immigration status were not predic-

tive of cognitive decline; however, increasing decline with
increasing age and decreasing level of education is consis-
tent with findings reported earlier (30). Living with others
was predictive of changes in cognitive impairment among
participants who had dropped to 17 or below (Criterion-1),
but was not associated with Criterion-2 decline (3 points).
An explanation for this finding could be attributed to the
level of manifestations of decline. Subjects who dropped to
an MMSE score of 17 or below at follow-up declined to se-
vere cognitive impairment, which made them dependent on
others. They were also more likely to have experienced cog-
nitive and other difficulties at baseline and, thus, were more
likely to live with family members. Contrarily, most sub-
jects who declined under Criterion-2 were likely to have
only declined to a moderate level of cognitive impairment.
Thus, they may have experienced some diminution in cog-
nitive capacity yet at a moderate level that would allow
them to function without the assistance of others. This
would support the idea that Mexican American families try
to manage cognitively impaired elders in their home envi-
ronments and have them relocate to the family home only
when they become less manageable due to decline or cata-
strophic event (e.g., hip fracture, pneumonia).
Although hypertension was not predictive of cognitive
decline, stroke and diabetes were significant predictors of
decline to the severe category (Criterion-1). They were not,
however, predictive of decline of three or more points (Cri-
terion-2). These results are in agreement with previously
published findings that the lack of significance may reflect
the fact that stroke and diabetes are more likely to associate
with a higher degree of cognitive decline (31,32). We did
find that diabetes and stroke predicted decline to the severe
category. Other studies have suggested that increased dura-
tion of diabetes is associated with increased cognitive im-
pairment (31,33) and that the risk for cognitive impairment
decreases as the interval between stroke and impairment in-
creases. For example, the odds for cognitive impairment 3
months after onset of stroke were found to be higher than
the odds of cognitive impairment after 52 months of follow-
up (34). Hypertension was not associated with cognitive de-
cline, although it has been found to be inversely related with
memory in older adults (35). The discrepancy in such find-
ings can be partly explained by different measures of hyper-
tension. The absence of an accurate blood pressure measure
may reduce the ability of our models to identify the associa-
tion between hypertension and cognitive decline.
Depressive symptomatology was independently associ-
ated with cognitive decline. Previous research with the same
data has shown high rates of depressive symptoms in older
Mexican Americans, especially women (36). It is possible
that depression sometimes mimics early dementia by caus-
ing a decline in scores on cognitive status tests (12,37).
Near-vision impairment was significantly associated with
cognitive decline under both criteria. Vision impairment has
been found to influence the level and quality of interactive
experiences of older adults, thereby reducing their capacity
to develop and maintain relationships and to participate in
activities that may improve their physical, mental, and psy-
chosocial well-being (38). Thus, it is possible that visual
impairment could exacerbate cognitive impairment indi-
rectly if it predisposes an individual to depression and social
isolation. Hearing impairment was not predictive of decline
in the present study, which is consistent with prior research
suggesting that this condition per se is not an independent
risk factor for cognitive decline (39). However, when evalu-
ating degree of dementia, the presence of severe hearing
loss coupled with cognitive impairment can result in a much
greater degree of dementia (38).
Certain limitations to the present study should be noted.
First, the study employed self-reported data of depressive
symptoms and, thus, may not be equivalent to a clinical di-
agnosis of depression. We believe that the use of a standard
clinical diagnosis of depression is necessary in order to
yield a more accurate relationship between depression and
cognitive decline. Second, the medical conditions are self-
reports of subjects about their health status. However, prior
research has found consistency between self-reported medi-
cal conditions and conditions reported in medical records
(32). Despite these limitations, the present study adds to our
understanding of the complex interrelationships between
depressive symptoms, chronic diseases, and cognitive func-
tioning in older adults. Our findings also suggest that, as a
screener, the MMSE may substantially overestimate cogni-
tive impairment in older Mexican Americans if these corre-
lates are not taken into account. More important, increasing
the awareness of these strong associations can help clini-
cians, particularly those who do not regularly work with
Mexican Americans, better monitor cognitive decline,
which has been associated with mortality and the onset of
disability (40).
