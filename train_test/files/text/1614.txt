Objective: To develop national and state level estimates for preventable bicycle related head injuries
(BRHIs) and associated direct and indirect health costs from the failure to use bicycle helmets.
Methods: Information on the effectiveness and prevalence of use of bicycle helmets was combined to
estimate the avoidable fraction, that is, the proportion of BRHIs that could be prevented through the use
of bicycle helmets. The avoidable fraction multiplied by the expected number of BRHIs gives an estimate
of the number of preventable cases. Direct and indirect health costs are estimated from a social
perspective for the number of preventable BRHIs to assess potential cost savings that would be achieved
if all riders wore helmets.
Results: Approximately 107 000 BRHIs could have been prevented in 1997 in the United States.
These preventable injuries and deaths represent an estimated $81 million in direct and $2.3 billion in
indirect health costs. Estimates range from 200 preventable BRHIs and $3 million in health costs in
Wyoming (population 480 000) to 13 700 preventable BRHIs and $320 million in health costs in
California (population 32.3 million).
Conclusions: A number of successful approaches to increasing bicycle helmet use exist, including
mandatory use laws and community based programs. The limited use of these strategies may be related
to the fact that too little information is available to state agencies about the public health and economic
burden of these preventable injuries. In conjunction with information on program costs, our estimates
can assist state planners in better quantifying the number of preventable BRHIs and the costs and ben-
efits of helmet promotion programs.
Each year in the US, nearly 700 persons die from bicycle
crashes1 and 567 000 more are treated in emergency
departments.2 About two thirds of these fatalities and one
third of these injuries are related to a head injury.3 4 Although
bicycle helmets substantially reduce the risk such injuries,5­7
the majority of bicyclists do not always wear helmets.8 9
One reason for the limited use of successful strategies to
increasing bicycle helmet use10 may be related to the dearth of
information at the state level about the public health burden
and associated health costs of these preventable injuries. This
information could demonstrate to decision makers that
promoting helmet use could be a cost saving investment.
Accordingly, we report national and state specific estimates of
preventable bicycle related head injuries (BRHIs) and the asso-
ciated health costs for 1997. We also discuss methodological
issues and data gaps encountered in developing these estimates.
METHODS
We use four steps in the estimation process (fig 1). State level
population estimates are multiplied by the corresponding
national death,hospitalization,and emergency department visit
rates to generate the expected number of cases. The proportion
of cases that could be prevented--the avoidable fraction--is
estimated by combining information on helmet effectiveness
and prevalence of use. The avoidable fraction is multiplied by
the expected number of injuries to estimate the number of
avoidable cases of fatal and non-fatal injuries. We then estimate
the direct health costs of medical treatment and the indirect
health costs due to losses in productivity from premature death
and permanent disability for the avoidable cases.
Because of a lack of information on state specific BRHI
incidence,11 state level incidence estimates are obtained by
applying national rates to state population data. Associated
state level health cost estimates are developed from both state
and national data.12
An incidence based, cost-of-injury approach is used to esti-
mate the "lifetime" economic burden of BRHIs, including all
direct costs for medical care and the indirect costs related to
lost productivity due to disability or premature death
associated with the injury.
All incidence and cost estimates are for 1997. These are
characterized by their presentation as: fatalities, non-fatal
hospitalized cases, and non-hospitalized emergency depart-
ment cases.
Estimating the expected number of cases
We used National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) multiple
cause of death files from 1993­95 to estimate the incidence of
fatal BRHIs13 by selecting deaths with bicycle related external
cause of death and associated N codes suggestive of head
injury.3 4 The International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 N and E
codes included: 800­801.9; 803; 804; 850.0­854.9; 905.0; 907.0;
E800-E807 with a fourth digit of 0.3; E810­E819 and
E820­E825 with a fourth digit of 0.6; E826.1; and E827­E829
with a fourth digit of 0.1. Because NCHS data are too sparse
when subdivided by state, age, and gender, we pooled the three
years of national level data to produce stable age and
gender-specific rates that were applied to 1997 state population
figures.

The national incidence of non-fatal hospitalized BRHIs is
estimated using the 1994 Healthcare Cost and Utilization
Project (HCUP) database,14 which consists of uniform hospital
discharge records from 17 states. To identify BRHIs, 15
diagnosis fields were searched for the same ICD-9 N codes and
E codes used to identify fatalities. All records with a BRHI
noted in any of the 15 diagnosis fields are included. To ensure
unbiased incidence estimates, we only include nine states
with at least 80% of their head injury records E coded. In
eliminating eight of the 17 states, 510 hospitals, 686 BRHIs,
and approximately 3.3 million hospital discharge records were
eliminated. Because the HCUP database is designed to support
national level estimates and survey weights are provided for
this purpose, weighting adjustments were made to compen-
sate for the loss of cases in non-E code states.
Data from the 1993­95 Consumer Product Safety Commis-
sion's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS)
was used to estimate the national rate of emergency
department visits.15 We identified bicycle related injuries using
the product code field, and head injury using the body part
field (which notes the most severely injured part). Head injury
included injury to the eye, ear, face, and head because these
injuries are preventable with bicycle helmets.6 16
Estimating the avoidable fraction and the number of
avoidable cases
Age specific avoidable fractions were assumed constant for
fatalities, non-fatal hospitalizations, and non-hospitalized
emergency department visits, and estimated as17:
where p is the proportion of riders who do not use helmets and
RR is the relative risk of BRHI for those who do not use
helmets compared with those who do.
The proportion of riders who use helmets in a particular age
group (l-p) is assumed to be 31.8% for those less than 10 years
of age, 17.5% for those 10­14 years old, 7.5% for 15­19 year
olds, 19.2% for 20­64 year olds, and 18.6% for those older than
65.8 9 The relative risk is assumed to be 3.23 regardless of age
or gender.6
In each state, the number of avoidable cases for each age
and gender group is obtained by applying the age specific
avoidable fractions to the age and gender specific expected
numbers of BRHI.
Estimating the direct health costs for the avoidable
cases
The direct health costs associated with the avoidable cases are
estimated separately for fatalities, non-fatal hospitalized
cases, and emergency department visits. Included are the costs
of health care services used in acute and rehabilitative phases
of treatment: inpatient hospital services, services of health
professionals, those provided in emergency departments and
outpatient clinics, and physical and vocational rehabilitation.
We do not include costs for outpatient pharmaceuticals, long
term care, home health care, medical supplies and devices, and
patients' time costs in accessing these services. Because the
distributions of costs are right skewed, the geometric mean for
each cost category is estimated.
Fatalities
Medical expenses for fatally injured persons vary by the
length of time between injury and death. Three situations are
considered: (1) those who die at the scene of the crash or in

transit from the crash to the hospital, (2) those who die in the
emergency department, and (3) those who die after hospital
admission.
Because data on the costs of paramedic and emergency
transport services are not systematically collected by cause
and type of injury, and because the literature contains only a
few estimates of these costs for head injuries that are based on
small samples of patients with very severe head injuries,18
these costs were not included.
Estimates of average emergency department treatment
costs were developed from charges included in emergency
department encounters for BRHIs from the state of Missouri
for 1994 and 1995. Charges per encounter were converted to
costs using a case weighted average operating cost-to-charge
ratio for urban Missouri hospitals.19 Patient's disposition at
discharge (for example, discharged home, admitted to hospi-
tal, died) is not noted in these data, thus, the same average
cost estimate is used for each disposition.
The direct health costs for persons who die in the hospital
are assumed to include: (1) inpatient services, (2) physicians'
fees, and (3) emergency department costs. The HCUP
database is used to estimate total hospital charges per
discharge at the national level. Costs per discharge are
estimated from charges using 1994 state level, case weighted
average operating cost-to-charge ratios for urban and rural
hospitals.19 As the cause of a head injury should have little
bearing on whether the record is E coded, discharge records
from all 17 states in the HCUP database are used to improve
the precision of the estimates. Physician fees are estimated as
39% of the costs of the index admission.20 State specific
estimates of hospital costs and physician fees are derived
using state-to-national ratios for hospital costs per admission

and physician practice costs.21 22 Emergency department costs
for persons who died after admission to the hospital are esti-
mated, as are the costs for those who died in the emergency
department, using encounter data from the state of Missouri.
To estimate costs for each type of fatality, we assumed that
approximately 50% of the deaths occurred at the scene of the
injury or in transit, 30% occurred in the emergency
department, and 20% after hospital admission.23
Non-fatal hospitalized cases
The direct health costs for non-fatal hospitalized avoidable
cases are assumed to include: (1) emergency department
costs; (2) hospital costs and physician fees for the initial
admission and inpatient rehabilitation; (3) outpatient reha-
bilitation; and (4) costs for subsequent hospitalizations.
As for fatalities, estimates of the average emergency
department costs for non-fatal hospitalized cases are devel-
oped from emergency department encounter records from
Missouri, and national average inpatient costs are estimated
by applying cost-to-charge ratios to the charges included in
the HCUP data. The remaining components for non-fatal hos-
pitalized avoidable cases are estimated as a per cent of the
costs of the index admission: 39.0% for professional fees; 4.7%
for subsequent hospitalizations; 3.4% for inpatient rehabilita-
tion; and 2.7% for outpatient rehabilitation.20
Emergency department cases
As discussed above, the average emergency department costs
for BRHIs treated and released from the emergency depart-
ment is the same as for patients who died or who were admit-
ted to the hospital following an emergency department
encounter.
Estimating the indirect costs for the avoidable cases
To estimate productivity losses at the state level, we modified
the human capital approach for prevention effectiveness.24 For
each state, age and gender specific estimates of indirect costs
were estimated using state level data on average wages,
employment, and labor force participation by age and gender.
The individual age-gender estimates were summed to obtain
the overall state estimate. Because not all of these data
elements are available by race, we could not make state
specific, age and gender estimates by race. Annual productive
value is estimated as the sum of annual earnings, including
fringe benefits and annual imputed value of housekeeping
services. Economic valuation for lost leisure time and pain and
suffering are not included because methods for quantifying
these outcomes in monetary terms are not well developed.
Similarly, productivity losses for partial disability are not
included. With death or permanent total disability, annual
losses are accrued over the remaining years of a person's
expected lifetime and discounted to present values at a 3%
discount rate.25 For children and adolescents who are not yet in
the labor force, the value of future lost work time is estimated
in terms of projected lifetime earnings using the annual wages
and salaries of current workers and an estimated annual
increase in non-farm labor productivity of 1.7%.
Estimates for adults are based on rates of "failure to return
to work" observed in follow up studies of workers who
suffered severe head injuries.26­30 Because injury severity is an
important predictor of time to return to work and the
proportion of injured persons who never return to work, the
severity of injury for each discharge record in HCUP was
quantified using the abbreviated injury scale (AIS).31 The age
and AIS specific distribution of cases from HCUP was
multiplied by the AIS specific estimates of failure to return to
work from the literature to estimate the severity adjusted age
specific per cent of cases who fail to return to work. The rates
of failure to return to work observed in the studies of adults
are assumed to occur among children once they reached
working age. We assume that if an individual did not return to
work after two years, he or she is likely to remain permanently
unemployed due to disability.
Sensitivity analysis
We explored the effects of modifying key parameters
including: (1) estimating the incidence of non-fatal hospital-
ized cases using HCUP principal diagnosis versus any diagno-
sis of BRHI; (2) estimating the incidence of hospitalized inju-
ries using NEISS data versus HCUP; (3) varying the relative
risk; (4) varying the discount rate to estimate the expected
lifetime productivity losses for fatalities and for non-fatal
hospitalized cases; (5) using data from Seattle, Washington, to
estimate emergency department rates versus the NEISS 15; and
(6) varying assumptions about the per cent of non-fatal hos-
pitalized cases who either go, or return, to work after a BRHI.
RESULTS
This study estimated that, in the US, approximately 327 fatal,
6900 hospitalized, and 100 000 ED cases of BRHI could have
been avoided in 1997 with universal use of bicycle helmets
(table 1). These preventable cases are associated with more
than $81 million in direct and $2.3 billion in indirect health
costs. Estimates range from 200 preventable BRHIs and $3
million in health costs in Wyoming (population 480 000) to
13 700 preventable BRHIs and $320 million in health costs in
California (population 32.3 million).
Both the number of cases and the direct and indirect health
costs are extremely sensitive to changes in the relative risk
(table 2). The number of avoidable cases in 1997 in the US
ranges from approximately 56 000 to 139 000 and the total
health costs range from $1.3 to $3 billion depending on the
choice of relative risk. Lifetime indirect health costs are

DISCUSSION
We estimate that if all riders wore helmets, approximately
107 000 BRHIs--and the associated $2.4 billion direct and
indirect health costs--could have been avoided in the US in
1997. Even using the most conservative assumptions, 56 000
BRHIs could have been prevented, for a total health cost sav-
ing of $1.3 billion. Our estimates do not include economic
valuation for lost leisure time, pain, and suffering. Human
capital estimates are smaller than injury cost estimates that
take these aspects of injury into account.32
Being comprehensive in estimating the costs and benefits of
injury is essential for analyses conducted from the social per-
spective when economic comparisons are needed among a
number of diverse injury prevention interventions, for exam-
ple, bicycle helmets, smoke detectors, and seat belts.25 It is our
view that analyses conducted from a governmental perspec-
tive are also useful for planners.
Numerous methodological issues and data gaps face anyone
attempting to generate analogous state level estimates for
other injury prevention interventions (fig 1):
Need for state level estimates (steps 1­4)
Because of the lack of state level data systems, estimates for
helmet use prevalence, incidence, and costs were generated
using national data. Geographic variation in BRHI incidence is
likely, however, because of variability in the prevalence of hel-
met use and in bicycle riding patterns related to weather.
Temporal effects (steps 1B, 1C, 4)
Without periodic updating, estimates quickly become out-
dated. For example, a change in the use of the intervention
over time affects not only estimates of prevalence of use, but
also estimates of expected injury incidence rates, and severity
and disability distributions. Similarly, many of the data
needed to develop the components of direct and indirect
health costs vary over time, for example, medical care costs,
wages, and the proportion of the population employed.
Because specific types or causes of injuries are relatively rare
(for example, BRHIs), pooling several years of data may be
necessary to achieve stable estimates, but this may mask time
trends.
Need for age and gender specific estimates (steps 1, 4)
Incidence rates, direct and indirect health costs, prevalence of
use of the intervention, and effectiveness of the intervention
may vary by age and gender. Similarly, control efforts often
target particular segments of the population.
Unavailable data (steps 1C, 4)
Many data needed are not readily available from state or
national sources. For example, although large numbers of
non-fatally injured persons are initially treated in outpatient
departments, physicians' offices, and other ambulatory care
settings, encounter data from these settings do not generally
include E codes to identify the external cause of injury. Simi-
larly, several treatment cost categories, including paramedic
and emergency transport costs and costs for long term care,
are not available. It is often impossible to distinguish subsets
of persons whose risk for injury varies. For example, early
adopters of an intervention may have a different level of risk
of injury than do late adopters, and the costs may be different
as well, because early adopters tend to have less severe
injuries. It is often necessary to extrapolate from highly
selected series of patients that are not representative of the
situation for which an estimate is needed. We used studies of
return-to-work in severely injured adults to estimate the like-
lihood that a child would be permanently disabled.
Non-comparability of existing data sources (steps 1, 4)
Obtaining comparable figures is a challenge because existing
data sources use different case definitions, measures of sever-
ity, referent years, and age groupings.
Multiple injuries (step 4A)
Decisions must be made about how to apportion costs for a
BRHI if a person has multiple injuries and conditions.
Defining the intervention (step 1B)
There are distinctions between the intervention and the
system of intervention delivery and between the efficacy
(ideal circumstance) and the effectiveness (real world results)
of both. We define the intervention as a bicycle helmet that is
worn; a law mandating its use would be a delivery system.
Either could be modeled, assuming that the post-intervention
prevalence of the risk factor can be defined.
Valuation of time for groups for whom there are no
directly comparable labor market experiences, that is,
the elderly, children, and those unable to work (step
4B)
For a cost-of-injury assessment of a health and safety
intervention, the appropriate measures of the opportunity cost
of time are the wage rates of the individuals for whom the
intervention is targeted. Implementing this approach presents
problems for groups for whom there are no wage data. Practi-
cal alternatives and further research into methods for valuing
the time of these groups are needed.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PREVENTION
While we are making estimates of the incidence and economic
burden of BRHIs for the US and the individual states, the
problem is well documented internationally.33 34 We highlight
these methodological issues because we believe that the
debate in injury, and disease prevention, needs to shift from
total burden to preventable burden. Using this model we hope
to generate state level estimates of the numbers of preventable
hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases and deaths for other
types of injuries, along with the associated direct and indirect
Key points
· Too little information is available to state agencies about the
public health and economic burden of preventable bicycle
related head injuries (BRHIs).
· We estimated that, in the US, approximately 327 fatal,
6900 hospitalized, and 100 000 emergency department
cases of BRHI could have been avoided in 1997 with uni-
versal use of bicycle helmets. These preventable cases are
associated with more than $81 million in direct and $2.3
billion in indirect health costs.
· Even using the most conservative assumptions, 56 000
BRHIs could have been prevented in the US, for a total
health cost saving of $1.3 billion.
· Estimates range from 200 preventable BRHIs and $3
million in health costs in Wyoming (population 480 000) to
13 700 preventable BRHIs and $320 million in health costs
in California (population 32.3million).
· In conjunction with information on program costs, these
estimates can assist state planners in better quantifying the
number of preventable BRHIs and the costs and benefits of
helmet promotion programs.
· Numerous methodological issues and data gaps face any-
one attempting to generate analogous state level estimates
