Abstract
Objectives: A double-blind randomised study to evaluate the opioid sparing effect and safety of
nefopam when administered via intravenous patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with fentanyl.
Methods: Patients planned for elective open laparotomy, were randomly assigned to receive into
fentanyl 25 mg/ml (SF group) or nefopam 2.4 mg/ml plus fentanyl 25 mg/ml (NF group). Patients were
assessed before surgery and for 24 h postoperatively.
Results: Total PCA fentanyl consumption was significantly lower in the NF group (n ¼ 35) than the
SF group (n ¼ 36). Pain scores were significantly lower and patients' satisfaction with treatment
significantly better in the NF group than the SF group. Dry mouth and dizziness were significantly
more frequent in the NF group than the SF group. There were no other statistically significant
between-group differences in the incidence of adverse events.
Conclusions: Intravenous PCA using nefopamþ fentanyl following laparotomy has an opioid sparing
effect and is associated with a low incidence of some of the typical opioid related adverse events.

Introduction
Approximately 80% of patients undergoing
surgery may experience pain and for 86% of
these patients the pain will be moderate-to-
severe in its intensity.1 Postoperative hyper-
algesia after major surgery not only increases
morbidity and mortality but can also initiate
the development of chronic postoperative
pain.2,3 Opioid based patient controlled anal-
gesia (PCA) has been commonly adopted to
manage postoperative pain, and analgesics of
different classes with different mechanisms of
action are often combined to reduce the dose
of each medicine and so lessen the likelihood
of adverse events.4 Adjuvant treatment with
agents such as nefopam, paracetamol, non
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
and ketamine have been shown in many
studies to enhance postoperative analgesia or
reduce opioid related side effects after some
major surgeries. 4­8
Nefopam hydrochloride (AcupanÕ,
BIOCODEX, France) is a centrally acting
antinociceptive compound that inhibits the
reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine and
dopamine, the three most important sub-
stances in the transmission of pain, and has
supraspinal and spinal sites of action.9
Studies in animals have also shown that
spinal noradrenergic modulation and block-
ade of voltage sensitive calcium and sodium
channels by nefopam modulates glutamater-
gic transmission.10,11 As a consequence, there
is decreased activation of postsynaptic gluta-
matergic receptors (e.g. N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptors), which are involved in the devel-
opment of hyperalgesia.10,11
Nefopam was developed in the early 1970s
as an antidepressant and myorelaxant,12 but
has been shown to be effective in preventing
acute postsurgical hyperalgesia13­15 and non-
surgical neuropathic pain.16 Oral and intra-
venous forms of nefopam are used, and the
drug has an oral bioavailability of 40% and a
plasma half-life of 3-5 h. Plasma peak con-
centrations are reached 15-20 min after
intravenous injection and at 30min during
continuous infusion.17 Although the minimal
effective concentration of nefopam is not
known, its usual daily dose for postoperative
pain ranges from 20 ­ 120 mg intravenously
and 90 ­ 180 mg orally;14 there may be a
ceiling effect at approximately 90mg/day.18
The effect of nefopam in the prevention of
postoperative pain has been reviewed,19 and a
large number of clinical studies have explored
the use of nefopam in various perioperative
settings.1,6,8,13-16,18-24 However, its use as an
adjunctive or main agent for postoperative
intravenous PCA has only been evaluated
in limited patient groups, 20-22 and to our
knowledge, has not been evaluated after
laparotomy.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the
opioid sparing effect of nefopam when
administered intravenously with fentanyl as
PCA, and to evaluate any adverse events
(AEs) that occurred over a 24 h period
following surgery in patients who had
undergone laparotomy.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study recruited patients aged 20 ­ 65
years and classified as American Society
of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status
I­II,25 who were scheduled for elective
open laparotomy under general anaesthesia
at Seoul National University Hospital,
Republic of Korea between October 2012
and September 2013. Exclusion criteria were:
the presence of renal or hepatic disease; high
risk of urinary retention; seizure history;
known allergy to any of the medications
used; current history of psychiatric disorder,
or taking psychotropic medications or mono-
amine oxidase inhibitors. Patients who could
not understand the verbal rating scale (VRS)
and/or the 11-point numeric rating scale
(NRS)26 were also excluded.
Ethical approval for the study (IRB
No. 1203-082-402) was provided by the
Jin et al. 845
Institutional Review Boards in Seoul
National University Hospital on 1 October
2012. Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients.
Study design
The study was double blind and patients
were assessed pre- and postsurgery for 24 h.
Patients were randomly allocated between
two treatment groups using a computer
generated code. Both groups were provided
with 50 ml of intravenous PCA: SF group,
1250 mg fentanyl in normal saline (25 mg/ml);
NF group 1250 mg fentanyl plus 120 mg
nefopam in normal saline (25 mg/ml fentanyl
and 2.4 mg/ml nefopam). The dose of nefo-
pam was based on its maximum recom-
mended daily dose. The randomization
codes were kept by an independent anaes-
thetist and were only opened after study
completion or in the case of an emergency.
On the day before surgery, pain intensity
was evaluated using the VRS (0, no pain; 1,
mild pain; 2, moderate pain; 3, intense pain)
and NRS (numbers from 0 to 10 represent-
ing `no pain' to `worst pain imaginable'),
and were shown how to use the PCA device.
On the day of surgery, electrocardiography,
noninvasive blood pressure (BP), peripheral
oxygen saturation and end tidal carbon
dioxide monitors were attached to each
patient for continuous monitoring.
Anaesthesia was induced with 30 mg lido-
caine and 2 mg/kg propofol iv, followed by
0.9 mg/kg rocuronium for facilitation of
tracheal intubation. Anaesthesia was main-
tained with 2.0­2.5% sevoflurane and 50%
air in oxygen. A PCA device (APMÕ,
Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL) was
connected to the intravenous line but
remained turned off while the patient was
in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU).
For both treatment groups, the intravenous
PCA was provided without a background of
continuous infusion and with limits of 1 ml
bolus, 8 min lockout time (maximum of
7.5 ml/h and 180 ml/day). The intravenous
PCA was refilled if required and was avail-
able throughout the 24 h study period.
An anaesthetist not involved in the study
assessed pain intensity using the VRS score
at 5 min intervals as soon as the patient
awoke. If the patient reported VRS ! 3, the
anaesthetist administered a rescue bolus
dose of 1 mg/kg fentanyl iv. Additional
rescue bolus doses of fentanyl were admin-
istered until VRS < 3. The patient was with-
drawn from the study if the score did not fall
below 3 despite five rescue doses of fentanyl
and after 30 min in PACU. For those
patients with VRS < 3, the PCA device was
turned on and the patient was encouraged to
use the preset bolus doses of study treat-
ments. After 30 min in PACU, patients were
transferred to a ward and a research fellow
anaesthetist not involved in the study rec-
orded NRS pain score at rest and on moving
at 1 h, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h postsurgery.
Data on the cumulative PCA dose as dis-
played on the PCA device were recorded and
transferred to a computer for interpretation.
No additional analgesics, antipyretics, or
anti-inflammatory drugs were permitted
during the study.
Sedation was assessed by the independent
research fellow anaesthetist using the
Observer's Assessment of Alertness and
Sedation (OAA/S) scale (5, responds readily
to name spoken in normal tone; 4, lethargic
response to name spoken in normal tone; 3,
responds only after name is called loudly or
repeatedly; 2, responds only after mild
prodding or shaking; 1, does not respond
to mild prodding or shaking; 0, does not
respond to noxious stimulus).27 Patients
were considered sedated if the OAA/S scale
score was < 4 at any one time point during
the PACU stay, and < 5 on the ward.
Any AEs observed during the 24-h study
period were recorded by the independent
research fellow anaesthetist. Patients were
asked if they had experienced any of the
following: hypertension; tachycardia;
846 Journal of International Medical Research 44(4)
sweating, shivering; nausea; vomiting; sed-
ation; pruritus; dry mouth. Hypertension
and tachycardia were also defined as BP or
heart rate (HR) changes of ! 20% from
preoperative baseline values on more than
two consecutive evaluation points. Patients
who experienced nausea and vomiting
received 0.075 mg palonosetron iv. In spite
of satisfactory pain control, if the patient
persistently complained of any of the above
adverse events, PCA was stopped and the
patient was withdrawn from the study.
Patients were also withdrawn from the
study if, on the OAA/S scale, they scored
zero at any time point or 1 at more than two
consecutive time points. Additionally, a
systolic BP > 160 mmHg, a diastolic
BP > 100 mmHg, or HR > 100 beats/min at
two consecutive time points or intolerable
palpitations were also criteria for
withdrawal.
Satisfaction of the analgesia achieved
with intravenous PCA was assessed at the
end of the study (24 h after surgery) using a
4-point VRS (0, no satisfaction; 1, mild
satisfaction; 2, moderate satisfaction; 3,
intense satisfaction).
Statistical analyses
The primary study endpoint was the cumu-
lative dose of fentanyl administered via
PCA. Secondary endpoints were the com-
parison of pain intensity and occurrence of
AEs.
Based on previous data,1 32 subjects per
group were required to detect a 20% reduc-
tion in fentanyl requirements in the first 24 h
after surgery, with an alpha level of 0.5 (two-
tailed) and a beta level of 0.1 (90% power).
Therefore, estimating a dropout rate of
20%, 36 patients were required for each
group. Patient characteristics, intraopera-
tive data, cumulative fentanyl consumption,
mean BP and HR, were analysed using
Student's t-test. Analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) was used to adjust for baseline
differences between the two groups. The
incidence of AEs and patient satisfaction
were analysed using 2 test. Pain and sed-
ation scores were analysed using Mann­
Whitney U-test.
P-values < 0.05 were considered to be
statistically significant, and statistical ana-
lyses were performed using SPSSÕ version
19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ.
Results
The study recruited 73 patients (NF group
n ¼ 37, SF group n ¼ 36) (Figure 1); two of
which were withdrawn from the NF group
(one had unstable vital signs and the other
was accidently enrolled into another study).
Demographic, surgical and fentanyl con-
sumption data for the remaining 71 patients
are shown in Table 1. With the exception of
the ratio of males to females and height of
the patients, there were no statistically sig-
nificant between-group differences in base-
line characteristics, surgical data, or rescue
fentanyl consumption during PACU stay.
Patients in the NF group consumed signifi-
cantly less fentanyl on the ward (from
30 min ­ 24 h postsurgery; PCA consump-
tion) than those in the SF group (P ¼ 0.001;
Table 1). The total amount of fentanyl
consumed in the first 24 h after surgery was
significantly lower in the NF group than the
SF group (P ¼ 0.0009; Table 1).
When ANCOVA was used to adjust for
baseline differences in sex and height, PCA
fentanyl consumption and total fentanyl
consumption remained significantly lower
in the NF group than the SF group
(P ¼ 0.005 and P ¼ 0.004, respectively).
Data regarding NRS scores are shown in
Figures 2 and 3. Patients in the NF group had
significantly lower NFS scores on movement
from 2 h postsurgery (P < 0.0001 at each
timepoint; Figure 2) and at rest from 1 h
postsurgery (P < 0.0001 at each timepoint;
Figure 3) compared with the SF group.

Discussion
Patients in the NF group consumed signifi-
cantly less PCA fentanyl for postoperative
pain control than those in the NF group in
the present study. This was associated with
decreased intensity of pain both at rest and
on moving, and increased patient

satisfaction at 24-h postsurgery in the NF
group compared with the SF group, findings
that are in agreement with those of
others.1,6,8,15,19,23 A systematic review of
nefopam studies concluded that nefopam
has a postoperative morphine sparing effect
of almost 30% and decreases pain intensity
24 h after surgery.19 Nefopam 20 mg admin-
istered intravenously at 4 h intervals has
been shown to be consistently superior to
2 g intravenous proparacetamol adminis-
tered at the same intervals.8 In another
study, postoperative morphine requirements
were similar in patients receiving 20 mg
nefopam or 10 mg ketamine following
major surgery, indicating that both agents
were comparable in enhancing postopera-
tive analgesia.6
The high NRS scores seen at 1 h after
surgery in the present study reflect the
complexity of pain control in the immediate
postoperative period. Patients are just
recovering from drowsiness when they are
transferred to the ward from PACU. Pain

management may be insufficient but the use
of opioids has to be weighed carefully
against the risk of sedation. In addition,
transferring from PACU to the ward and
moving from bed to bed may cause add-
itional stress for the patient. We conclude
that more care should be given to improve
the pain status during this transition period
and that preoperative patient instructions
on PCA use should be emphasised and
perhaps a PCA bolus dose be given imme-
diately before patients leave the PACU.
With the exception of dizziness and dry
mouth, adding nefopam to the intravenous
PCA did not appear to increase the inci-
dence of opioid-related side effects such as
nausea, vomiting, sedation, shivering,
sweating and itching. Others have shown
that AEs commonly associated with nefo-
pam include tachycardia, sweating, nausea,
vomiting, drowsiness, light headedness,
asthenia, and pain at the injection site, but
these are often transitory and moderate in
severity.6,8,17,28 Nefopam does not suppress
the central nervous system and has no
respiratory depressive effect.29 Moreover,
nefopam has a clear advantage over
NSAIDs in that it does not cause gastric
mucosal erosion or affect platelet aggrega-
tion.24 Although HR was significantly
increased in the NF group compared with
the SF group during the first 2 h and 24 h
after surgery in the present study, there was
no between-group difference in the incidence
of tachycardia. The incidence of sweating,
another commonly reported adverse event
associated with nefopam, was not signifi-
cantly different between groups, although
two patients in NF group versus one in SF
group experienced moderate-to-severe
sweating. Tachycardia, sweating and, to a
lesser extent, postoperative nausea and
vomiting may be due to the antimuscarinic
and sympathomimetic activity of nefo-
pam,30 and related to its maximal concen-
tration and rate of increase in plasma
concentration.28 The dose of nefopam
chosen for our study was relatively low
(approximately 50 mg/day), and this may
have influenced the occurrence of AEs
reported here.
Although nefopam is considered well
tolerated in therapeutic dose ranges, uncom-
mon and sometimes fatal adverse events
have been reported with this drug.31,32 For
example, a case of postoperative permanent
blindness31 and several cases of fatal intoxi-
cation.32 In addition, one study reported an
unexpected increase in its plasma levels even
though the doses were within the therapeutic
range.33 Currently, there is no formal guid-
ance for adjusting the dose of nefopam in
cases of renal disease or in the elderly.28
However, decreased kidney function or end
stage renal disease (ESRD) may result in
abnormal accumulation of nefopam. The
drug was found to exhibit a lower clearance
and higher peak concentrations in patients
with ESRD compared with healthy volun-
teers.34 The pharmacokinetics of nefopam
may also be affected by age; one study
estimated that for the same infusion dur-
ation of 20 mg of nefopam, three times lower
total clearance and three times higher
plasma concentrations of nefopam were
observed in the elderly compared with
younger subjects.28 Therefore, an infusion
time of > 45 min for a single dose of nefo-
pam and a 20 mg dose for the elderly are
recommended to decrease the side-effects of
nefopam.28 A limitation of the present study
was the small sample size. Further, larger
studies are therefore required to confirm
these findings and provide more safety data.
In conclusion, intravenous PCA using
nefopam þ fentanyl following laparotomy
has an opioid sparing effect and is associated
with a low incidence of some of the typical
opioid related AEs. The use of
nefopam þ fentanyl was associated with
decreased intensity of pain, both at rest
and on moving, and increased patient satis-
faction at 24 h postsurgery, compared with
fentanyl alone. Further studies with more
852 Journal of International Medical Research 44(4)
patients are required to confirm these results
and define the recommend dose and regimen
of nefopam for intravenous PCA after
laparotomy and other types of surgery.
