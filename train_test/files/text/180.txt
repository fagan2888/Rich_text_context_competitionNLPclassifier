Double Jeopardy, Aging as Leveler,
or Persistent Health Inequality?
A Longitudinal Analysis of White and Black Americans
Kenneth F. Ferraro and Melissa M. Farmer
Purdue University.
Longitudinal datafrom a 15-year national survey of adults are used to test the doublejeopardy to health hypothesis as
well as the alternative hypotheses that aging levels ethnic differences and that health inequalities persist across the life
course. Findings show that African Americans began the study in poorer health and manifested higher mortality.
Among survivors, young and middle-aged Black adults developed more serious illness and their subjective health
declined more rapidly than their White counterparts during thefirst 10 years of the study. Among subjects with heart
failure, Blackpeople were also more likely than Whites to become more disabled over time. Depending upon the health
measure considered and the analytic strategy applied, there was evidencefor all three processes, but the weight of the
evidence shows persistent health inequality over the life course. Indeed, evidence for the age-as-leveler thesis was
eliminated by accountingfor mortality during the study.
A MAJOR initiative of research on health among minority
·**· elders has been an examination of the double jeopardy
hypothesis (Dowd and Bengtson, 1978; Jackson, 1985;
National Urban League, 1964; Wykle and Kaskel, 1994).
Researchers have sought to determine if being both old and a
member of a minority creates a double disadvantage to the
health of people in this subpopulation. As originally formu-
lated, racial discrimination throughout one's life and age
discrimination in later life may have combined negative
effects on health status and perhaps the procurement of
health resources available to others (i.e., White, younger
people). There is substantial evidence that Black persons
generally suffer more health problems (Livingston, 1994;
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1991;
Wolinsky et al., 1989). According to the double jeopardy
hypothesis, however, one needs to demonstrate that the
health differential between adult Whites and Blacks in-
creases with age.
Despite the popularity of the concept in American society
and its extension to the triple jeopardy involving the com-
bined effects of social disadvantage by race, age, and
gender, empirical tests of the hypothesis as it pertains to
health have been fairly limited. The most serious limitation
is that most previous research has used a cross-sectional
design. Yet, if age changes are to be traced, cross-sectional
data are not optimal for testing the hypothesis (Dowd and
Bengtson, 1978; Markides, Timbers, and Osberg, 1984).
The primary purpose of this research is to use a nationally
representative longitudinal survey to determine if the health
disadvantage experienced by young and middle-aged Black
Americans increases, decreases, or stays about the same in
the later years. While this study examines Black/White
differences in health, the findings may also be useful for
studies of other minority groups and to inform policy
discussions regarding health care services (Cornelius,
Beauregard, and Cohen, 1991).
Review of Literature
Social scientists have long been interested in the origins
and consequences of racial and ethnic discrimination. The
double jeopardy hypothesis focuses on how discrimination
uniquely affects persons of color as they reach older ages.
According to Feagin (1991), "Particular instances of dis-
crimination may seem minor to outside white observers
when considered in isolation. But when blatant acts of
avoidance, verbal harassment, and physical attack combine
with subtle and covert slights, and these accumulate over
months, years, and lifetimes, the impact on a black person is
far more than the sum of individual instances" (pp. 114--
115). Hummer (1996) points out that the effects of racism
are not simply psychological or economic; he argues that
racism should be considered as having "a critical impact on
health and mortality within the United States" (p. 113).
Double jeopardy has generally been conceptualized as
occurring when minority persons are faced with a double
burden of racial and age discrimination or "multiple haz-
ards" (Jackson, 1971; National Urban League, 1964). In
actuality, this is one of three possible scenarios discussed in
the literature. The second is the possibility of age acting as a
leveler of Black/White health differences. The double jeop-
ardy hypothesis posits additional disadvantage from growing
older, but Dowd and Bengtson drew from the work of Kent
(1971) to alternatively hypothesize that minorities may be
better off in older ages. This may occur because (a) aging
brings such basic challenges to health and functional ability
that racial inequality is not as important and/or (b) minority
persons adopt coping strategies throughout the life course to
deal with racial discrimination, and these may help in deal-
ing with age discrimination. Dowd and Bengtson's (1978,
1981) research provided evidence for the double jeopardy to
health for both African and Mexican Americans in compari-
son to White Americans, and other studies have registered
some support as well on health (e.g., Jackson, Kolody, and
S319
S320 FERRARO AND FARMER
Wood, 1982) and institutionalization (e.g., Belgrave,
Wykle, and Choi, 1993).
Another set of studies tested the double jeopardy hypothe-
sis but led to the third scenario in considering how age and
race are related to health: persistent inequality (stability of
ethnic differences). Evidence for persistent health inequality
between Black and White persons comes from cross-
sectional studies (Ferraro, 1987; Markides, 1981, 1983;
Ward, 1983) and two longitudinal ones (Clark and Maddox,
1992; Ferraro and Farmer, 1996). These studies point to the
important health disadvantage of African Americans being
similar across the life span. Age neither levels the differ-
ence, nor exacerbates it.
Besides the obvious preponderance of cross-sectional
analysis used to test a hypothesis on aging, another key
limitation of the extant literature is the failure to consider
selective mortality. Indeed, the question of differential mor-
tality is critical to the considerations of what is meant by
double jeopardy. Recognizing minority differences in life
expectancy, a sample from a cross-sectional analysis yields
comparisons among representatives of different populations
for Black and White Americans. Because Black life expec-
tancy is generally lower (and not keeping pace with White
gains in recent years; Kochanek, Maurer, and Rosenberg,
1994), the proportion of Black adults surviving into older
ages is much smaller. In other words, the differences in life
expectancy between the two groups would decrease the
likelihood of revealing the operation of a double jeopardy
thesis in cross-sectional data. A longitudinal study of double
jeopardy, on the other hand -- especially a long-term one --
can account for mortality differences so as to determine if the
rate of intraindividual change is different for Black adults.
Perhaps this is why Markides, Timbers, and Osberg (1984)
claimed, "Long-term longitudinal designs that allow for the
impact of dropouts will be necessary to test more adequately
the double jeopardy hypothesis" (p. 47).
There appears to be little debate as to whether Black
persons generally have poorer health. The inconsistency in
findings derives from whether these differences amplify,
attenuate, or remain the same in the later years. Two
questions must be answered affirmatively in order to provide
evidence on these three alternatives: (1) Does the minority
group have poorer health than the White majority? (2) Are
the declines experienced by the minority group in later life
greater than, less than, or about the same as those experi-
enced by the White majority? Accordingly, these two ques-
tions correspond to two statistical tests: the first corresponds
to the main effect for the ethnic group studied, and the
second corresponds to the interaction of ethnicity and age
across the adult years.
METHOD
Sample
Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey-I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) are used
for this analysis (Madans et al., 1986, 1990; National Center
for Health Statistics, 1987). The study traced respondents of
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I
(NHANES I), conducted in 1971-1975, and first collected
additional information during 1982-1984 (Cornoni-
Huntley, Huntley, and Feldman, 1990). In addition, 1986
and 1987 follow-ups are available. The 1986 survey was
limited both in terms of variables assessed and number of
cases interviewed and seems to add little to the present
investigation. Therefore, data from the baseline survey and
the 1982-1984 and 1987 follow-ups will be used for this
investigation. For the purpose of this study, references to
waves one (Wl), two (W2), and three (W3) will refer to the
baseline, 1982-1984, and 1987 surveys, respectively.
The sampling design for the baseline survey was a multi-
stage, stratified, probability sample of persons ages 25-74
(see National Center for Health Statistics [1987] for details).
The analyses will be completed on the NHANES I subsam-
ple, which was administered the "detailed component"
including the Health Care Needs Questionnaire (N =
6,913). The percent of cases at baseline receiving the de-
tailed component and traced through follow-ups is very good
(92% in 1982 and 96% in 1987). The sample is composed of
5,968 White and 873 Black respondents (12.8%). It is an
excellent representation of the U.S. noninstitutionalized
population within this age range, and provides adequate
statistical power for this analysis.
Vital status was determined for all traced respondents in
the baseline survey. In-depth interviews were conducted
with surviving participants, including those placed in nurs-
ing homes, and brief interviews were conducted with prox-
ies for those who were deceased or incapacitated between
waves. Date of death was obtained for 1,337 decedents.
Therefore, event history analyses were performed to model
attrition due to mortality and will be discussed in detail
below. In addition, logistic regression analyses were used
to examine Black/White differences in other forms of attri-
tion. A total of 284 of the baseline subjects refused partici-
pation by W3, and 453 respondents were not available
(e.g., not traced, out of the country). Results from the
logistic regression analyses reveal that Black subjects were
not more likely to either refuse participation in or be
unavailable for the follow-up surveys.
Measurement
Table 1 presents means and standard deviations for all
variables used in the analyses. The measures of health status
cover indicators which are more objective indicators of
morbidity as well as the widely used "self-rating of health,"
often referred to as subjective health. As such, they represent
a broader array of variables than what has been used in most
previous studies of the subject. Some measures are available
for all three waves; others are only available at two.
The measures of chronic and serious illnesses are counts
of the conditions that each respondent identified. Respon-
dents were asked a series of questions for selected condi-
tions; for example: "Did a doctor ever tell you that you had
hypertension or high blood pressure?" Dummy variables for
each condition were constructed (0, 1) and these were
summed. Serious or life-threatening illnesses were cancer,
diabetes, heart failure (attack or trouble), hypertension, and
stroke; chronic conditions include arthritis, cataracts, hip
fracture, and kidney disorder. Adding the illnesses together
is widespread in measuring morbidity (Gibson, 1991b;

Liang et al., 1991). At the same time, adding serious and
chronic conditions separately captures a fundamental dis-
tinction between the illnesses without resorting to a large
number of dummy variables to represent each illness. For
selected analyses, however, dummy variables for each ill-
ness will be used (e.g., Idler and Kasl, 1991).
Identical measures of functional health were not available
at all waves. At Wl, restricted activity was used as a basic
measure of functional impairment and is coded 1 = quite
inactive, 0 = otherwise. It is the sum of two questions on
recreational and nonrecreational exercise. For W2 and W3,
the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Dis-
ability Index is used in revised form (Foley et al., 1990). The
original index included 26 items but a few items were either
deleted or modified in the 1987 interview; the index used
here is based on 21 items. Missing data on the index were
recoded to the mean if the number of items across which a
case was missing data was less than six (Hertel, 1976;
Rubin, 1987). If respondents missed more than six items,
they were treated as missing on the index (Little and Rubin,
1987).
Subjective health was measured with the question,
' 'Would you say that your health in general is excellent, very
good, good, fair, or poor?" (Ranging from 1, poor, to 5,
excellent).
Table 1 also presents the means and standard deviations
for the predictor variables used in the final analysis. (A
number of additional variables were considered in prelimi-
nary analyses but deleted because they did not significantly
affect the results presented below.) The variables span a
broad range of factors known to be related to health, either
directly or indirectly (Mutchler and Burr, 1991). The mea-
surement of most is relatively straightforward. Two different
coding schemes for education were used in preliminary
analyses, one with 18 categories reflecting years of school-
ing attended and one with eight categories reflecting socially
recognized achievement patterns for these cohorts (e.g.,
completed high school). Preliminary results using the two
coding strategies for education were virtually identical, and
the latter was chosen because its distribution is less skewed.
Respondents with Medicaid or private health insurance were
distinguished with binary variables. Obesity is defined ac-
S322 FERRARO AND FARMER
cording to the Centers for Disease Control's norms: body
mass index equal to or greater than 27.8 for men and 27.3 for
women (American Public Health Association, 1992). Smok-
ing was based on self-report of consumption of cigarettes,
cigars, and pipe tobacco at the time of the interview and
during one's lifetime. All predictor variables are measured at
the baseline; some are available at follow-ups. When
changes occur (e.g., income), they were incorporated in the
analysis.
RESULTS
To begin, means and standard deviations for the health
variables are shown in Table 1, and tests were conducted to
assess between-group differences. At baseline, Black sub-
jects manifest a health disadvantage on all the indicators,
from chronic illness to subjective health. The same pattern
was observed in W2 and W3: African Americans have more
chronic and serious illness, higher disability, and poorer
subjective health than White Americans. Thus, consistent
with other studies, there is no question of whether Black
adults have poorer health: they are clearly disadvantaged.
The double jeopardy hypothesis, however, rests on examin-
ing change in the health differential. Does the health differ-
ential increase with aging? The bulk of the analysis, there-
fore, assesses change in health status indicators among all
available adult subjects in the study. A final step is to
perform a series of analyses to examine the role of selective
survival.
Health Change in Adulthood
All three waves of data were used to examine change in
health for Black and White subjects. The bulk of the analytic
plan uses two successive waves of data to identify basic
patterns of change using residualized regression procedures
(Allison, 1990; Cronbach and Furby, 1970). In a separate
article by the authors, only change between the first and last
surveys was considered (Ferraro and Farmer, 1996). Al-
though many findings from the two approaches are similar,
some are unique and provide new insights for understanding
ethnic health inequality. Besides the different use of the
waves, we performed two additional sets of analyses for the
present research: (a) tests of other interactions by Black,
especially interactions with the separate diseases, and (b)
explicitly incorporating mortality into analyses of change in
"health" following the procedures of Markides, Timbers,
and Osberg (1984).
Applying residualized regression procedures creates
models of change in the outcome under consideration. The
Wl indicator of health is entered first in the equation,
thereby testing the effects of the covariates on change in the
variable measured at two times. An alternative procedure is
to calculate change scores (Allison, 1990). Seven of the
eight OLS equations presented below were calculated with
both the residualized regression and change score methods
-- and the pattern of results was almost identical. As
described earlier, the measures of functional limitations
were not identical at all three waves, so the change score
method could not be applied to one of the eight equations.
Given this limitation as well as the widespread use of and
ease in interpreting the residualized regression procedures,
they are presented below.
Table 2 presents the longitudinal regressions of the four
health indicators at W2 on the relevant predictors at baseline.
The first equation shows that higher chronic morbidity was
observed for older people, those on Medicaid, obese per-
sons, and those with higher chronic illness at Wl. In the
second equation, serious illness became more prevalent by
W2 among those .who had a serious illness at Wl, older
people, men, Black persons, rural residents, and those with
less education. Health behavior was also important, as obese
persons and past smokers were more likely to develop a
serious illness. As might be expected, higher disability was
associated with higher morbidity at baseline and restricted
activity. In addition, higher levels of disability were ob-
served for older persons, women, widowed persons, smok-
ers, and subjects with limited incomes or on Medicaid. As
shown in Table 2, an interaction term for Black and age was
included in all three equations but was nonsignificant.
Turning to the final equation, a decline in subjective
health was observed for persons with higher levels of chronic
and serious illness, restricted activity, and those who judged
their health to be poor at Wl. A decline in health was also
observed for older people, men, Black adults, and persons
with lower educational attainment and less income. Obese
persons and both current and past smokers were also more
likely to report a decline in subjective health over the 10-year
period. Unlike the other equations, the Black x Age interac-
tion is significant, but not in the direction consistent with
double jeopardy. In tandem with the negative effect for
Black, the positive effect for the interaction term reveals that
the subjective health of young and middle-aged African
Americans declined more rapidly than for young and
middle-aged Whites, but that among Black elders no such
decline occurred. Given that Black adults began the study in
poorer health than their White counterparts, this is evidence
of a shrinking of the health disadvantage in the later years,
what has been referred to in the literature as aging as a leveler
of ethnic differences. This was the only case where the
stability of racial differences between Wl and W2 was not
supported.
Parallel equations for change in health between W2 and
W3 are presented in Table 3. Most results are quite similar to
those reported in Table 2, but chronic illness increased more
rapidly for women during this period, while serious illness
continued to increase among men. No Black x Age interac-
tions were observed for either of the indicators of morbidity.
The effects of social class variables continued to be impor-
tant. Lower education, less income, having a regular physi-
cian, and being on Medicaid were associated with more
rapid declines in selected measures of health. Obesity's
effect was also significant for increasing serious illness and
declining subjective health. Not only were the interaction
terms for Black and age nonsignificant, but the main effects
for Black were also nonsignificant during the five-year
period. Overall, these results provide evidence for the stabil-
ity of racial differences.
In addition to double jeopardy, tests for triple jeopardy
(age, race, and gender interactions) were also performed
(not presented). In no case was evidence for the triple

jeopardy effect revealed. In short, the bulk of the evidence
reveals substantial health inequality by ethnicity, but these
differences did not amplify for either older Black men or
older Black women. Black/White differences in health
emerge far before later life, and subjective health among
Black older adults does not decline more rapidly than it does
for White elders. In fact, for the first 10 years of observation,
subjective health among African American elders did not
decline as rapidly as it did for White elders -- suggesting a
leveling of age differences among survivors.
The next procedure for assessing change was to examine
the effects of the individual illnesses on functional limita-
tions and subjective health over the study period. The es-
sence of this approach is to substitute dummy variables for
each illness in place of the variables for chronic illness and
serious illness used thus far. Given the ethnic differences in
epidemiology for several of these conditions (e.g., hyperten-
sion, diabetes), interaction terms were also created and
tested (i.e., Black x Disease). Illnesses that were nonsig-
nificant in the initial models were deleted from subsequent
models. If there were main effects for an individual illness,
then interaction terms for each of the illnesses with Black
were created and tested one at a time. These analyses (not
presented) showed that physical disability increased more
rapidly for persons with arthritis, diabetes, heart failure, hip
fracture, and hypertension. Only one case of statistical
interaction was uncovered: the interaction of Black and heart
failure on disability. The interaction of Black and heart
failure indicated that heart failure's effect on disability was
stronger for Black subjects than for White subjects. Analy-
ses for change in subjective health with the individual
illnesses as covariates were also conducted. Only three
diseases played a strong role in declining perceived health:
arthritis, diabetes, and hypertension -- the last two of which
have much higher prevalence among Black subjects. Yet,
none of the interactions for any of these conditions by Black
were significant. Overall, these findings confirm the earlier
results that Black Americans of all ages report poorer subjec-
tive health as they age -- the decline is not limited to just
Black elders as predicted by the double jeopardy hypothesis.
A final step in the analysis of health changes in adulthood
was to consider other periods of the life course when the
Black disadvantage may increase. Based on the emerging
body of research giving attention to important health differ-
ences developing in middle age, especially among persons
of lower socioeconomic status (SES), a series of alternative
specifications were undertaken to examine the possibility
that the Black disadvantage may increase in middle age
rather than in later life (see House et al., 1990, 1994). In
these supplementary analyses, three age groups were con-
trasted: 24-44, 45-64, and 65 and over. With the youngest
group serving as the reference group, there were no in-
stances where the Black disadvantage increased for the
middle-aged group. While it is possible that Black disad-
vantage may increase on other health indicators, there is no
evidence of such an increase on the four indicators available
over time in NHEFS.
Mortality Analysis
One of the weaknesses of how the double jeopardy hy-
pothesis was originally developed and specified was that it
did not explicitly consider the role of mortality. Therefore,
the next phase of the analysis seeks to account for mortality,
especially Black/White differences in mortality. Over 1,300
respondents died between 1971 and 1987, and because date
of death was recorded, event history models were used to
determine if Black Americans' mortality occurred sooner
than that of Whites in the sample. Estimates were obtained
with both parametric procedures based on Weibull models
and proportional hazards models (Allison, 1984; Cox, 1972;
Statistical Analysis System, 1990; Teachman and Hayward,
1992). The significance of effects is identical from the
Weibull and the proportional hazards models; only the latter
are presented below.
The results of four event history models using propor-
tional hazards are displayed in Table 4. The first is a
mortality analysis over the entire study period (W1-W3).
The results from this equation (first column) show that the
strongest effects on survival were for gender and present
smoking status: women and nonsmokers were less likely to
have died. Beyond sex and smoking, note that Black sub-
jects were more likely to die during the study period. The
effect of serious illness on mortality is positive, whereas the
effect of chronic illness on mortality is negative (although
slight in magnitude). In addition, survival was higher for
those without activity restrictions, better subjective health,
younger respondents, higher income, and other health insur-
ance. Although African Americans are more likely to have
poorer subjective health, there is an independent effect due
to ethnicity.
The only difference in the second equation is the addition
of the interaction term for age and Black. The results of this
model are quite similar, but note that the main effect for
Black is stronger and the interaction term is also significant
but negative. In short, the Black disadvantage in mortality
risk is greater in the young and middle ages; Blacks' higher
mortality risk actually decelerates in the later years, a finding
that is consistent with the racial-mortality crossover findings
of others (Manton, 1982). The third and fourth models
presented use the two-wave sequences to estimate mortality
risk and include the interaction term for age and Black.
These models are quite similar, but the interaction term is
only significant in the final equation. Given NHEFS upper
age limit at baseline of 74, the deceleration of the Black
disadvantage in mortality risk is not significant in the third
equation, but is significant by the final wave. This is consist-
ent with the findings that the racial-mortality crossover does
not occur at least until the late 70s or 80s (Manton, 1980).
Note also that other health insurance and smoking are sig-
nificant risk factors only in the analysis between Wl and
W2, but that serious illness is an important risk of mortality
in all equations. The survivors, however, are more likely to
manifest chronic illnesses.
' 'Health'' Status Change Including Decedents
As a final way to consider the effect of mortality on
interpretations of the double jeopardy hypothesis, a set of
"pseudovariables" was created for W3 that included the
respondents who died for nonaccidental reasons (i.e., acci-
dental deaths were excluded through the use of NHEFS

mortality records). Markides, Timbers, and Osberg (1984)
used this procedure in their longitudinal study of health
among Anglo and Mexican Americans (see also Vaillant,
1978). The pseudovariables were created by coding the
deceased subjects in poorer health. For subjective health,
where scores normally range from (1) = poor to (5) =
excellent, we scored deceased subjects as zero. (For the
morbidity and disability indicators, deceased subjects were
scored higher.) The results of these analyses with NHEFS
are displayed in Table 5. For parsimony, only the analysis
between Wl and W3 is shown.
The purpose of the analyses shown in Table 5 is to
explicitly incorporate the role of selective survival in under-
standing health inequalities across the life course -- because
not doing so may underestimate the possibility of detecting a
double jeopardy effect. The most obvious differences from
these findings in comparison to those among the survivors
only were that men, older people, and smokers manifested
much greater "health" disadvantages in these analyses. In
addition, serious illness -- but not chronic illness -- was
important in predicting disability and subjective health, and
the effects of income were stronger in all four equations. A
Black x Age interaction was significant in the equations for
chronic illness and disability, consistent with the double
jeopardy hypothesis. (Penultimate models without the inter-
action term reveal significant main effects for Black and age,
but the main effect for Black in the two equations with the
interaction was not significant.) Thus, simultaneously con-
sidering health status and mortality provides some evidence
for the double jeopardy hypothesis on two indicators:
chronic illness and disability. A main effect for Black was
observed in the equation for subjective health; its effect was
negative as expected, but no significant interaction was
manifest. Coupling the findings of earlier analyses largely
showing the stability of ethnic differences in health with the
findings from Table 5 suggests that, indeed, the higher
mortality risk of African Americans is part of the reason why
evidence for double jeopardy has been lacking in the litera-
ture. At the same time, such an effect was only observed on
two of the four measures of health status. The other conclu-
sion from these findings is that there is no evidence in
support of the age-as-leveler thesis when including the
deceased subjects in the analysis. Indeed, these results
suggest that selective survival may be a chief reason for
findings supporting the aging-as-leveler thesis, and that the
hypothesis specified by aging as leveler (of individual differ-
ences) should be recast as selective survival as leveler among
populations. While caution is urged for interpretations based
on the pseudovariables used here, the direction of these
effects cast serious doubts on the original formulation of the
aging-as-leveler hypothesis as pertains to health.
DISCUSSION
While the hypothesis of double jeopardy to health has
garnered the most attention in the literature, three outcomes
were considered related to aging and differences in health
among minorities: (1) double jeopardy, which refers to
amplified health problems in later life; (2) age-as-leveler,
which refers to diminished health differences by ethnic
groupings; and (3) persistent inequality of ethnic differ-
ences. Depending upon the measure of health considered
and the analytic strategy employed, there is some evidence

for each process, although the findings offer the most sup-
port to the persistent inequality of ethnic differences inter-
pretation as reported by others (Clark and Maddox, 1992;
Ferraro, 1987, 1989; Ward, 1983).
These data show that Black adults have poorer health at all
three times and on a variety of different measures. In
general, the findings show that Black Americans of all ages
suffer from health problems, not just the older adults. In
addition, some of these differences are due to social class
variables (see also Blau, Oser, and Stephens, 1979). Be-
cause African Americans have, on average, lower educa-
tional attainment and family income, they also suffer a
health disadvantage. Several of the previous studies of
double jeopardy had limited indicators of social class and
financial resources. While NHEFS does not have exhaustive
data on financial status, we have seen that income, educa-
tion, insurance type, and having a regular physician are
important. The effects due to smoking and obesity were also
important when examining the outcomes and, again, few
previous studies on the subject included these as covariates.
Future research on age changes in health inequities needs to
consider these types of life-style factors for at least two
reasons: (1) they differ across ethnic groups and (2) there has
been substantial change in smoking and obesity during the
past 30 years.
The findings do not in any way diminish the enormity of
health problems for African Americans. Rather, it is the
depiction of Black elders, and their problems, which these
findings may call into question. The event history analyses
showed that African Americans were found to be less likely
to survive into older ages. Black Americans suffer a health
disadvantage from birth through much of life (Baquet, 1988;
Malone and Johnson, 1985; Mangold and Powell-Griner,
1991). The evidence that health problems may have worse
effects on African Americans was also demonstrated here by
the interaction of Black and heart failure on disability. Black
adults with heart failure may have been identified later or not
as quickly referred to treatment (Anderson et al., 1993;
Ayanian et al., 1993; Gillum, 1987). Whatever the case,
these data show that once Black people have heart trouble,
the condition is more likely to disable them.
One limitation of these data for addressing the research
question is the possibility of different orientations to and
reports of health problems among Black and White subjects.
For instance, the morbidity questions are based on whether
or not a physician ever told the subject that he or she had a
condition. Whereas White adults have more frequent physi-
cian visits, they may be more aware of their health problems.
There is also the possibility that morbidity and functional
limitations mean something different to Black and White
subjects when evaluating their health. Gibson (1991b) found
that health reporting is actually quite similar among Black
and White older adults, but some caution is in order. It is
possible that the results from NHEFS may have underesti-
mated the Black disadvantage, although these data clearly
show a Black disadvantage at the baseline interview.
When confining the analysis to survivors of the 15-year
study, there was no evidence for double jeopardy as origi-
nally stated. African Americans who survive into advanced
older ages may not be nearly as health disadvantaged as
DOUBLE JEOPARDY TO HEALTH S327
suggested by the double jeopardy hypothesis. As Gibson
(1991a) shows, there is a more morbid group of younger
Black elders and a relatively robust group of Black elders in
advanced ages. The racial mortality crossover is also evi-
dence of the more favorable status of Black elders who make
it into advanced old age (Manton, 1980). Perhaps these
survival dynamics are part of the reason that the gap in
subjective health between older Black and White survivors
shrunk between the first two waves of the study.
The double jeopardy hypothesis may merit future research
but the bulk of accumulating evidence appears to speak
against it (even for Mexican Americans; e.g., Markides,
Timbers, and Osberg, 1984). Perhaps the emphasis upon
chronological age was misplaced in the original hypothesis.
Gerontologists have long held a skepticism about the use of
age as an independent variable (Botwinick, 1978), and the
double jeopardy hypothesis implicitly falls into an ontoge-
netic fallacy (Featherman and Lerner, 1985; Stahl and
Feller, 1990). The link to a specific chronological age (e.g.,
65) is not necessary to conceptualizing ethnic inequality over
the life course (Ferraro and Farmer, 1996).
Finally, the findings from this study emphasize the impor-
tance of explicitly considering the role of mortality in models
of health inequality. Most of the previous research attention
was focused on health but with cross-sectional data. By
studying respondents at one time period only, one compares
the health of minority and majority persons at different ages.
While health and survival are obviously related, different
interpretations may derive from single-wave analyses of
ages known to have differential mortality. Because Black
life expectancy is generally lower, the proportion of Black
adults surviving into older ages is much smaller, meaning
that the survivors are somewhat of an elite. Selective sur-
vival in human populations also makes White older persons
somewhat of an elite, but the effect is more pronounced in
the Black population because of their higher mortality at
earlier ages.
Without accounting for selective mortality, the idea of
using double jeopardy as a vehicle to study racial inequality
in health at one point in time may be misleading. These data
clearly show that Black Americans suffer the jeopardy of
shorter life, but this is not something that develops in later
life; actually, the mortality risk for Blacks relative to Whites
decelerates in later life (Manton, 1982, 1988). The early
years of the life course pose the greatest mortality risk, and
this risk continues throughout most of the adult years.
Indeed, when including the deceased subjects in the analyses
of "health status" change, there was evidence of double
jeopardy on two of the four health indicators. We are not
aware of any studies which have explicitly considered mor-
tality in tests of these hypotheses among Black and White
subjects such as was done here (Markides, Timbers, and
Osberg, 1984, studied Anglo and Mexican Americans).
Although caution is warranted in the use of the pseudovaria-
bles applied here, nonaccidental mortality conveys some
health information, and integrating such information into
health inequity studies deserves further investigation. Stud-
ies which do not explicitly account for selective survival may
inadvertently "stack the deck" against finding a double
jeopardy effect. It appears that additional cross-sectional
studies of double jeopardy have little to offer in extending
the literature on health inequality among minority groups.
However, additional panel studies which explicitly account
for mortality, perhaps with selection bias models (Winship
and Mare, 1992), should prove useful.
The results of the present investigation generally point to
health inequities being present early in life and persisting
throughout the life course. These health inequities contribute
to the higher mortality risk of Black adults, but the survivors
-- Black older adults -- appear to have overcome considera-
ble disadvantage in maintaining their health. The findings
also suggest that the hypothesis specified by aging as leveler
should be recast as selective survival as leveler among
populations.
