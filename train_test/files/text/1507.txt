ABSTRACT
Background: Because of the relation between chronic disease and
poor nutritional habits, the use of food labels and adherence to
dietary recommendations are important for chronic disease popula-
tions. We explored whether persons with chronic disease read nu-
trient information on food labels and whether they were aware of
dietary guidelines.
Objective: This study aimed to assess dietary information use
among persons with chronic disease by using a nationally represen-
tative sample of the US population.
Design: A total of 5603 respondents aged 17 y from the 2005­
2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey partici-
pated in the study. This representative sample of US civilians were
asked 17 questions regarding their awareness of federal nutrition
information and their food label use and were given two 24-h recall
dietary interviews. Participants were classified into 5 disease cate-
gories: 1) hypertension, 2) hypercholesterolemia, 3) diabetes/at risk
of diabetes, 4) overweight, and 5) heart disease.
Results: Subjects with chronic diseases were more aware of nutri-
tional recommendations, checked more often for specific nutrients,
and used nutrition information on food labels more often than did
participants without such diseases. Label use behavior was incon-
sistently associated with dietary guideline compliance.
Conclusions: People with chronic disease generally reported better
nutrition awareness and food label use and checking behaviors
compared with those without chronic disease, but this did not trans-
late into unequivocally better eating behaviors. New strategies are
needed to improve the actual nutritional behaviors of persons with
chronic disease. Am J Clin Nutr 2009;90:1351­7.
INTRODUCTION
To attenuate the morbidity and mortality associated with
chronic diseases, American dietary habits need to be modified.
Many Americans are suffering from the spectrum of coronary
artery and cardiovascular diseases and diabetes (1, 2), which
are 3 of the most prevalent chronic diseases. For example, .50
million Americans (.30% of the population) have hypertension,
which results in inordinate medical expenses (3); .700,000
Americans lose their life to heart disease every year (4); and 24
million children and adults have diabetes (7.8% of the pop-
ulation), with 57 million Americans having prediabetes or im-
paired fasting glucose (5). Given the enormous public health
costs of these diseases through untimely deaths, disability, or
lost worker productivity, improving the dietary habits of the
American population is urgently warranted (6, 7).
The primary national mechanism used to communicate the
importance of good dietary habits is through the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans, which is published jointly every 5 y
by the US Departments of Health and Human Services and
Agriculture (8). In addition, the United States has mandated
nutritional labeling on most food packages through the Nutrition
Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (9). These labels were
instituted to assist the population in making healthier dietary
choices that would ultimately have a positive effect on public
health (10). However, despite the detailed nutrition information
printed on most food packages, many Americans ignore these
labels and continue to make bad dietary choices (11). Even with
increasing usage of food labels, many Americans still have dif-
ficulty understanding and applying the information in their lives
due to deficits in literacy and numeracy and other issues (12).
Several studies have investigated the relation between the use
of nutrition label information, health status, and related behaviors
with varying results (13­15). For example, in one study, the use
of nutrition labels was inversely related to a person's intake of
total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol (15). Another study
showed that reading labels was associated with nutrition
knowledge, perceived importance of a healthy diet, and an un-
derstanding that eating too much fat is related to being un-
healthy (15). Furthermore, a study in patients receiving care
from medical clinics reported that those individuals reading
nutrition labels in the prior year ate less fat and more fruit and
vegetables than did subjects who did not use labels (16). An-
other study showed that '80% of the participants read labels
and that label use was related to eating less fat (14). Finally,
a population-based assessment of African Americans showed
that the use of nutrition labels was related to obesity, healthy
eating self-efficacy (ie, self-confidence in one's ability to eat

relation, and trying to lose weight (17).
Although these aforementioned studies have attempted to
explain some of the diverse sociodemographic, psychosocial, and
attitudinal factors related to using nutritional labels, it is virtually
unknown how often nutrition labels are used by people who
already have been diagnosed with a chronic disease or condition
(eg, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, heart disease, over-
weight, or diabetes). In addition to the use of labels, the
awareness of basic nutrition information, such as the US dietary
guidelines, the Food Guide Pyramid, or the 5-A-Day program,
among persons with chronic disease is also uncertain. Thus, the
objective of this study was to assess nutrition label and in-
formation use among persons with major chronic diseases and to
correlate such behaviors with reported dietary habits by using
a nationally representative sample of the US population.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Data source
The 2005­2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES), as part of the ongoing, stratified, multistage
probability sample of the US civilian noninstitutionalized
population, asked participants 17 questions regarding their
awareness of federal nutrition information programs and their
use of food labels and asked them to provide two 24-h dietary
recalls by interviews conducted on nonconsecutive days, which
were used to derive values for total energy and protein, car-
bohydrate, fat, saturated fat, and fiber in grams (18). Household
interviews were conducted in persons aged 17 y to determine
responses to all of these label use and dietary behavior items.
Items from the 2005­2006 NHANES survey as described be-
low were used to construct the chronic disease categories,
which included 1) hypertension, 2) hypercholesterolemia, 3)
diabetes/at risk of diabetes, 4) overweight, and 5) chronic heart
disease. A total of 5603 respondents were used for analysis in
this study, representing '222 million people (calculated by
using the Current Population Surveys for persons aged 17 y
as recommended in the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention NHANES tutorial ``Age Standardization and Pop-
ulation Counts'' at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/Nhanes/
NHANESAnalyses/AgeStandardization/age_standardization_
intro.htm). This study was approved by the University of Miami
Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects.
Chronic disease items
For our analysis, we selected chronic diseases inherently re-
lated to poor or inadequate nutrition, including hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, diabetes/at risk of diabetes, overweight,
and heart disease. These conditions are self-reported within
NHANES and are defined by a ``yes'' response to any of the
following questions: 1) Has your doctor ever said you had hy-
pertension or high blood pressure? (hypertension); 2) Has your
doctor ever said that your cholesterol was too high? (hyper-
cholesterolemia); 3a) Has your doctor ever said that you had
diabetes or sugar diabetes? 3b) Has doctor ever said that you had
prediabetes, borderline diabetes, or impaired fasting glucose?
3c) Has your doctor ever said that you had a health risk of di-
abetes? (diabetes/at risk of diabetes); 4) Has your doctor ever
said that you were overweight? (overweight); and 5a) Has your
doctor ever said that you had heart failure? 5b) Has your doctor
ever said that you had coronary heart disease? 5c) Has your
doctor ever said that you had angina/angina pectoris? 5d) Has
your doctor ever said that you had a heart attack? 5e) Has your
doctor ever said that you had a stroke? (heart disease).
Label use behavior items
The NHANES asked detailed questions about behaviors re-
lated to using food labels and being aware of nutritional in-
formation. Each participant was queried about the following: 1)
Have you heard of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans? 2)
Have you heard of the Food Guide Pyramid? 3) Have you heard
of the 5-A-Day program? 4) How often do you use the nutrition
facts panel? 5) How often do you use the list of ingredients? 6)
How often do you use the size of serving? 7) How often do you
use the health claim? 8) How often do you use information about
calories? 9) How often do you use the information about calories
from fat? 10) How often do you use information about total fat?
11) How often do you use information about trans fat? 12) How
often do you use information about saturated fat? 13) How often
do you use information about cholesterol? 14) How often do you
use information about sodium? 15) How often do you use in-
formation about carbohydrates? 16) How often do you use in-
formation about fiber? 17) How often do you use information
about sugars?
Reported dietary behavior
Participants were interviewed on nonconsecutive days to recall
dietary data from two 24-h periods. This recall was analyzed to
provide total energy and protein, carbohydrate, fat, saturated fat,
and fiber in grams. To analyze how participants in each chronic
disease group were actually eating compared with national
recommendations for protein, carbohydrate, fat, saturated fat, and
fiber, the 2-d average for each of these variables was used. The
2-d average of total energy (calories) was used as the denominator
in these calculations. Because protein, carbohydrate, fat, and
saturated fat variables are reported in grams, protein (g) and
carbohydrate (g) were multiplied by 4 to get protein and car-
bohydrate in energy (in calories), and fat (g) and saturated fat (g)
were multiplied by 9 to get fat and saturated fat in energy (in
calories). Each of these 4 categories was divided by the total
energy to get the percentage daily intake for each nutrient. To fall
within the recommended guidelines of the Institute of Medicine
(19), the US Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human
Services (20), the American College of Sports Medicine, and the
American Dietetic Association (21), we used the following
ranges for participants for each macronutrient: 1) protein 10­
14% of daily energy, 2) carbohydrate 52­64% of daily energy, 3)
total fat 30% of daily energy, 4) saturated fat 10% of daily
energy, and 5) 25 g fiber/d. On the basis of their score, par-
ticipants were then dichotomized as being either ``adherent'' or
``nonadherent'' to the guidelines for each of these macronutrients.

label use behavior items by age, body mass index (BMI), marital

status, ethnicity-race, sex, and education for each of the 5 disease
categories. We used a principal components factor analysis with
an oblique rotation to form scales from the 17 label use behavior
questions. A polychoric correlation matrix was used as the basis
of this analysis because the items were mostly 5-point Likert
scales, except for the 3 binary ``awareness'' items. To determine
which items were associated with each factor, we chose items
from the reference structure matrix that had a semipartial cor-
relation coefficient of 0.50. Cronbach's coefficient a was cal-
culated for each scale to determine internal consistency. Linear
regression was then used to calculate the means and standard
errors for the label use behavior scales adjusted for the de-
mographic variables. The Statistical Analysis System (SAS)
9.21 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) was used for data manage-
ment and all analyses. SAS survey procedures were used to
perform weighted analyses that adjusted for the design effects of
the complex sampling used for NHANES. The percentages and
standard errors shown in Table 1 were computed by PROC
SURVEYFREQ, and the means and standard errors were pro-
duced by PROC SURVEYMEANS. The factor analysis results
in Table 2 were unweighted because the polychoric correlation
routine that computes the correlation matrix used in the factor
analysis does not accommodate weights. The means and stan-
dard errors in Tables 3 and 4 were computed by the ESTIMATE
statement in PROC SURVEYREG and were adjusted for the
covariates in Table 1 (ie, age, BMI, marital status, race-ethnicity,
sex, education, insurance status, and doctor's visit).
RESULTS
The numbers of eligible respondents who did or did not have
the self-reported chronic disease and demographic and clinical
characteristics, including age, sex, race-ethnicity, education,
BMI, marital status, health insurance coverage, and at least one
medical visit in the prior year are shown in Table 1. These data
varied considerably with chronic disease status but were not
compared statistically because they are reported only for de-
scriptive purposes.
Factor analysis
We computed 3 scales from the factor analysis of the 17 label
use behavior items. The 3 factors accounted for 79% of the
total variance. The reference structure matrix and a-coefficients
for the 3 computed scales shown in Table 2, are as follows: 1)
checking for specific micro- or macronutrients on the label
for total, saturated, and trans fat and total calories and calories
from fat, cholesterol, carbohydrates, sodium, fiber, and sugar
(``Check''); 2) using general information on the packaging, such
as the ingredient list on the label, health claims on packages,
serving size information, and nutrition facts panel (``Use''); and
3) being aware of national recommendations and guidelines of
the Food Guide Pyramid, the 5-A-Day program, and the US
dietary guidelines (``Aware''). After the scales were formed,
they were scored by summing the item responses. ``Check'' is
the sum of 10 items with responses of 1­5; ``Use'' is the sum of
4 items that range from 1 to 5; and ``Aware'' is the sum of 3
items with responses of 0 or 1.
Linear regression
The multivariate-adjusted means and standard errors for the
``Check,'' ``Use,'' and ``Aware'' scales for each of the 5 chronic
disease categories, comparing those who did and those who did
not have a disorder, are shown in Table 3. Those with hyper-
tension used more label and package information (P ¼ 0.021)

and were more aware of national dietary recommendations (P ¼
0.012) than those who did not have hypertension. Participants
with hypercholesterolemia showed more behaviors related to
checking for nutrient information on labels (P ¼ 0.014) and
used more label and package information (P ¼ 0.005) than those
with normal cholesterol. Subjects with diabetes or who were at
risk of diabetes and/or who were overweight displayed greater
awareness of national dietary recommendations, used more label
and package information, and checked for nutrient information
on labels when measured against those without diabetes or who
were not at risk of diabetes or of normal weight, respectively (all
P values ,0.01). Participants who did not have heart disease
used more label and package information than did their coun-
terparts with heart disease (P ¼ 0.043). Thus, in general, persons
with a history of chronic disease reported that they checked and
used label and package information and were more aware of
guidelines than those who did not have chronic disease.
Analysis of covariance between label use scales reported
dietary behavior scores
The means and standard errors (adjusted by age, BMI, marital
status, race-ethnicity, sex, education, insurance status, and
doctor's visit in prior year), calculated by using the label use
scales as dependent variables and the reported dietary behavior
scores as independent variables for participants who had 1 of
the 5 chronic diseases, divided by adherent or nonadherent to
the dietary guidelines for each macronutrient according to the
methodology described above, are shown in Table 4. Significant
differences were observed for the following: 1) carbohydrate
and protein and ``Aware,'' fiber and saturated fat and ``Use,''
and saturated fat and ``Check'' for hypertension; 2) fiber and
``Aware,'' protein and total and saturated fat and ``Check,'' and
fiber, protein, and saturated fat and ``Use'' for hypercholester-
olemia; 3) carbohydrate and fiber and ``Aware,'' protein and
saturated fat and ``Check,'' and fiber, protein, and saturated fat
and ``Use'' for diabetes/at risk of diabetes; 4) fiber and protein
and ``Use'' and protein and ``Check'' for overweight; and 5)
fiber and total and saturated fat and ``Use'' and fiber and total
and saturated fat and ``Check'' for heart disease. In summary,
the label use scales (``Aware,'' ``Use,'' and ``Check'') were re-
lated to nonadherence to dietary recommendations for carbo-
hydrate and protein consumption, whereas the scales were
related to adherence to dietary recommendations for fiber and
total and saturated fat, particularly for heart disease. All other
differences between groups were nonsignificant.
DISCUSSION
In this population-based study of Americans with different
chronic diseases known to have at least a partial dietary etiologic
component (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes/at risk
of diabetes, overweight, and heart disease), we examined nu-
trition label use by checking behaviors and awareness of national
nutrition information campaigns and by comparing such be-
haviors with reported dietary intake. After reducing the 17 in-
dividual label use behavior items to 3 well-defined scales (ie,
``Check,'' ``Use,'' and ``Aware''), we found that persons with
chronic diseases checked and used nutritional label information
and were more aware of national nutrition recommendations than
those participants who did not report having such diseases. In
particular, those with diabetes/at risk of diabetes and/or who were
overweight reported significantly more checking, using, and
awareness behaviors than did their nondiabetic and normal
weight counterparts, respectively. The results of our study are
strengthened by usinging the NHANES, which provides a data set
that is generalizable to the US population.
The results of our study provide useful information for policy
makers who are planning future national nutrition information
campaigns. Although using labels and being aware of nutritional
information before being diagnosed with chronic disease would
be preferable, reversal of disease symptoms is possible with
lifestyle changes, such as adopting healthier eating habits (22,
23). Thus, providing information about using nutrition labels
and about the key national campaigns may prove beneficial for
people attending primary care or specialty medical clinics in
encouraging the adoption of healthier dietary behaviors. In ad-
dition, people who use labels and are aware of important nu-
tritional information may have certain dietary concerns and want
to limit their consumption of fat and/or total calories, obtain
adequate amounts of key nutrients, and/or increase fiber con-
sumption. Another study showed that label users believed that
nutrition information is important in making food choices
compared with those who did not use labels (24).
In this study, we also compared label use behaviors with
reported dietary behavior scores that were derived from the
reported intake of protein, carbohydrate, total fat, saturated fat,
and fiber. Participants were dichotomized into whether or not
they adhered to daily recommendations for each of these nu-
trients and then the scores on the check, use, and aware factors
were compared for adherent and nonadherent subgroups for
each chronic disease group. Our analysis reveals a relation be-
tween those participants with hypertension, hypercholesterol-
emia, overweight, or diabetes/at risk of diabetes and those who
were nonadherent for dietary recommendations for carbohydrate
or protein; these participants also scored higher on awareness of
national dietary guidelines or using or checking dietary labels.
In contrast, participants representing all 5 chronic diseases,
particularly heart disease, who adhered to dietary recommen-
dations for fiber and total and saturated fat scored higher on the
aware, use, and check factors. Thus, we would surmise that the
use of information on nutrition labels and being more aware of
nutritional recommendations is related to meeting the daily
recommendations for fiber and total and saturated fat. However,
greater use of labels and awareness of recommendations may
not necessarily preclude other healthier behaviors. The use and
awareness of dietary information has been positively correlated
with increased nutrition knowledge and more favorable attitudes
about labels in a study of college students (25), which suggests
that nutrition knowledge is an important factor in food label use.
Limitations of this study include not being able to determine
whether participants are using and checking labels only for
certain foods and/or whether or not labels are being compared for
different foods. Participants might be using certain foods as
benchmarks--whether they are healthy or not--to make com-
parisons between amount of fat, number of calories, or amount of
sodium, for example, to make a purchasing decision without any
understanding of what is considered a healthy amount of these
nutrients to consume daily. If the participant is uninformed about
how much of what nutrients to consume, especially someone who

has already been diagnosed with one of these chronic diseases,
then the use of nutrition labels may be less than effective. We also
do not know if a participant is checking the label only the first
time that a product is bought and thus may not feel the need to
look at the label for successive purchases.
Another limitation is the inability to ascertain causality, given
the cross-sectional nature of the study. Although it is more
plausible that the presence of chronic disease preceded the ini-
tiation of food label use and awareness of nutrition information, it
is possible that a person was making use of food labels and was
aware of nutrition information before receiving a diagnosis of
a chronic disease. Thus, food label use and nutrition awareness
prior to diagnosis with a chronic disease implies that somehow
the nutrition information gained from reading labels and attained
from other sources is not as effective as it is believed to be, that it
is not being used properly, or that it is confusing the individual in
ways that prevent positive health outcomes. Furthermore, we do
not know whether the diagnosed participants are making use of
nutrition labels and are more aware of dietary recommendations
in response to being told about their medical condition. We also
do not know where these participants are receiving their advice to
use nutrition information and recommendations, but one likely
source would be the physician's office.
The results of our study suggest that those people who have
been diagnosed with a chronic disease may be open to increasing
healthy dietary behaviors, given their greater use of nutrition
labels and awareness of national nutrition recommendations.
However, just because people know about and use labels does not
necessarily translate into healthy dietary behavior. Thus, within
the spectrum of these chronic diseases, opportunities may exist to
further increase the use of food labels and the awareness of
nutritional recommendations in the context of improving healthy
dietary behaviors by using tailored, disease-specific messages.
Given that higher intakes of certain nutrients (eg, fat, trans fat,
and saturated fat) are linked to a greater risk of heart disease and
other chronic conditions (26, 27), individuals without disease
who do not use label information compared with those already
diagnosed with a disease would benefit from label information
and perhaps reduce their risk of developing these diseases.
Nonetheless, continued efforts at increasing the use of food la-
bels and promoting awareness of nutritional information and
recommendations are critically important in attempting to cur-
tail the various epidemics of chronic disease that the United
States currently faces.
