Special Issue- Student Diversity
Introduction
Interprofessional education (IPE) for health professionals
and multiagency working has been moving up the political
and professional agenda. Over the past 10 years, IPE has
become an integral part of many health and social care pro-
fessional programs throughout the United Kingdom. The
reason for the growth in IPE activity is the requirement for
health and social care graduates to be competent regarding
interprofessional collaboration and team working in a variety
of settings.
Through an evaluative inquiry approach, this article reports
on the way in which academic staff and students from the
School of Medicine Dundee, United Kingdom; National
Health Service (NHS) partners; local education department,
and primary school teachers engaged in a collaborative project
which has embedded community engagement in the curricu-
lum while encouraging IPE through multiagency working.
The School of Medicine offers a 5-year medical degree
program and delivers an integrated, systematic course where
contributions come from a range of specialties and commu-
nity-based teaching. The General Medical Council (2015)
sets out the outcomes for graduates. Students are expected to
be able to teach, reflect, communicate, work, and collaborate
with other members of the multidisciplinary team, in addi-
tion to respecting the values and beliefs of others.
The project began as a pilot in 2008 for medical and nurs-
ing students and was designed to achieve a number of spe-
cific goals. These include the enhancement of health care
undergraduate professionals'experience of collaboration and
team working, to introduce them to the concept of multia-
gency working, to work with young children and so gain a
practical understanding of childhood growth and develop-
ment, to inform their own skills as a teacher, and to enable
young children to gain knowledge about key aspects of
human health in a fun and interactive manner. The pilot proj-
ect was introduced to five local primary schools. Working in
pairs, medical and nursing students developed and delivered

Abstract
This study was designed to explore medical students' and primary school teachers' experiences of a new community teaching
project. Academic staff and students from the School of Medicine Dundee, National Health Service partners, local education
department, and primary school teachers engaged in a collaborative project which has embedded community engagement in
the curriculum while encouraging interprofessional education through multiagency working. Influenced by evaluative inquiry,
this qualitative study used an online questionnaire, designed to give participants the freedom to respond, and give their own
opinions, via free text responses. The results show the value of a real primary school­based situation, and the merit of
experiential learning gained throughout the program, in which students interacted with children about health promotion in
a meaningful way. The interprofessional and collaborative nature of the project enhanced the value of the experience for all
participants in relation to the benefits of teamwork, dispelling the doctor authority and recognition of the roles of others.
The experience was an interactive, enjoyable, and expressive way to facilitate learning, and has helped prepare the health
care students for future practice.

lessons across six afternoons to Primary 1 to Primary 7 pupils
aged 4 to 11 years.
The pilot enabled self-selected undergraduate health care
students to work collaboratively while deepening their learn-
ing, developing their professional attributes, and the knowl-
edge and skills to become competent teachers.
While this innovative program meets some of the explicit
requirements of the General Medical Council Tomorrow's
Doctors 2009 (General Medical Council, 2015), it also ful-
fills some of the Scottish Government's policy toward
Curriculum for Excellence (Her Majesty's Inspectorate of
Education, 2009) and the Determined to Succeed Strategy
(Scotland. Review Group on Education for Work and
Enterprise., & Scotland. Scottish Executive, 2002)
Due to its continued success, the pilot was the catalyst for
embedding the experience into the core medical curriculum.
A new community teaching experience, known as "The
Child Health Experience in Primary Schools" for all Year 2
medical students (n = 176), was designed and implemented
in 2014. It was delivered as a 4-week workshop within 16
local primary schools for pupils aged 4 to 6 years. The proj-
ect was planned with academic staff and students, NHS staff
(NHS Education for Scotland, 2011), employer engagement
officers within the education department, and schoolteach-
ers. There was ongoing discussion with the NHS consultant
and specialist registrar in child health, and the child play
therapist. All stakeholders were engaged in the project devel-
opment and its delivery. With the emphasis on IPE, students
and staff engaged in learning with, from, and about each
other to generate mutual benefit while inspiring, informing,
and educating the primary school pupils they taught.
Working in pairs, medical students delivered health edu-
cation activities to school pupils under the guidance of a pri-
mary school teacher. The outcomes for both projects was to
develop collaborative working while appraising the students'
role as a teacher; develop their communication and play with
the young child; develop their awareness of child health
growth and development at an early stage in their career,
while educating the young child about their body through
play and interaction; and apply the skill of teaching to
practice.
This encounter encourages multidisciplinary groups, to
not only gain from each other's particular experience and
professional approach but to respect different views and dif-
ferent perspectives in order to create something of great rel-
evance to the community, as a whole, and not just the
individuals involved.
This study is different in character from other studies as
medical students are seldom given the opportunity to engage
with children, who are not recipients of care within a health
care framework or system, at an early stage in their career
and within the community context, thus role modeling pro-
fessional behaviors and providing an opportunity for a more
diverse spectrum of children to encounter "health care" in
the safety of their own classroom environment.
The projects provide the students with a real primary
school­based situation in which to talk to children about
health promotion in a meaningful way. It strengthens simu-
lated teaching and practice-based learning by allowing the
students to develop many skills in relation to this topic and
communication skills related to this user group. The inter-
professional and collaborative nature of the projects further
enhance their value to the children, schoolteachers, and stu-
dent participants in relation to the benefits of teamwork, dis-
pelling the doctor authority and recognition of the roles of
others. The experiences are an interactive, enjoyable, and
expressive way in facilitating students', teachers', and school
pupils' learning, and in helping prepare the health care stu-
dents for their child health experience in future years.
This partnership has been ongoing since its inception, and
the original project has continued to develop. There have
been other collaborative developments. All participants are
kept involved in the project through sharing of findings via
local, national, and international channels including confer-
ence exhibits and workshops, poster presentations, local
newspaper articles, educational research projects, university
media, and web press sites.
Method
Aim
The aim was to provide medical students with a new oppor-
tunity to engage with children as part of a collaborative com-
munity experience.
Design
Methodologically, this study has been influenced by evaluative
inquiry (Preskill & Torres, 1999). The methodology was used
to enhance learning in an organization, whereby the evaluating
team's role was that of an informed facilitator, providing the
structure for a process to evaluate the learning experience using
dialogue, reflection, and challenge to distill learning opportuni-
ties, and to create a learning environment. Learning from eval-
uative inquiry is a social construction occurring through the
involvement of different groups, each representing different
perspectives. It is socially situated and is mediated through par-
ticipants' knowledge and experiences. Evaluation culture is an
accessible, teaching-orientated one that emphasizes the unity
of formal evaluation and everyday thought.
Situated within the qualitative paradigm of research, through
the collaboration of researchers and practitioners, the main data
collected were through an online self-completed questionnaire
which respondents filled in for themselves. It was designed to
give all participants the freedom to respond and give their own
opinions via free text responses (Thomas, 2010). This was effi-
cient in terms of researchers' time and effort and enabled a
greater depth of meaning to explore the participant's experi-
ence, values, beliefs, thoughts, and feelings.
Muir et al. 3
The questionnaires consisted of five key statements and
multiple substatements designed to ascertain the students'
and teachers' experiences of the program. To gather data
about knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors, question-
naires were used to gather information that is unique to indi-
viduals. Participant groups (student, teacher, head teacher)
were given questionnaires with similar questions. The ques-
tionnaire was adapted to reflect the individual group needs
and offer insight into the impact of the context with free text
answers to open questions. Discrete categories to exhaust the
possible responses which respondents may wish to give were
built into the questions (Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2007).
The degree of responses, intensity of response, and the move
away from dichotomous questions were managed by build-
ing in a degree of sensitivity and differentiation of response.
The questions within the questionnaire included the place-
ment and the participants perception of the child health expe-
rience, how stimulating or interesting was the station, the
value of the student engagement with the child, the value of
the preparatory lectures/small group work sessions, what did
they like best and least about the experience, suggestions for
improvement, and the main learning taken from the experi-
ence for their future career.
Questionnaires were helpful in maintaining participants'
privacy. The responses were anonymized; thus, confidential-
ity was maintained.
Project evaluation and feedback from staff, students, and
pupils through dialogue, discussions around the activities,
and opportunities for reflection have also been collated from
the start of the project. This dialogue allowed the researchers
to "hear" how participants perceived and experienced these
practices.
Participants
The Medical School delivers a 5-year integrated systematic
degree course. The program follows the structure of the spi-
ral curriculum (Bruner, 1977; Harden, 1999) revisiting
domains of competence throughout the 5-year program.
Approximately 165 students are admitted to the medical
degree program each year.
A total of 176 Year 2 medical students, 19 primary school
teachers, and seven primary school head teachers were
invited to participate in the study, of which 163 students, 19
teachers, and seven head teachers took part. All participants
provided consent at the beginning of the study period and
were advised that they could remove themselves from the
study at any time without any prejudice to them.
As evidence of their teaching contribution and demon-
stration of meeting the standards set within Good Medical
Practice (General Medical Council, 2013) and Tomorrow's
Doctors: Recommendations on Undergraduate Medical
Education students (General Medical Council, 2015), stu-
dents received a teaching certificate to include within their
e-portfolio.
Ethics Procedure
Dundee University Ethics Committee confirmed that the
project was carried out according to the ethical standards
upheld by the University of Dundee. Ethical considerations,
as defined in the British Educational Research Association
Guidelines (British Educational Research Association,
2011), were applied throughout the research.
Anonymity and confidentiality assurances were given so
that the rights of the individuals were not compromised.
Participants were given introductory information via email
and within the online questionnaire site with the details of
the study, why the study was being carried out, and the for-
mat of the questionnaire. They were given the opportunity to
decline participation in the study at any time.
A pilot study was conducted with two members of staff
who would not be participating in the main study.
Analysis
Online data were downloaded as a spreadsheet and codes
added to each respondent's questionnaire, in turn. The data
were checked for accuracy by a second researcher, a senior
academic. The data were then analyzed using an analytical
process which involves a number of interconnected stages to
classify and organize data according to key themes, con-
cepts, and emergent categories as they relate to the research
question. Internal validity was assessed in various ways
including reflexivity, triangulation, and peer judgment
(Creswell & Miller, 2000). Triangulation and data validation
were informed by the level of consensus of the groups and
convergence among the different sources of information to
form the themes in the study.
Introduction to Teaching
Academic staff and schoolteachers delivered preparatory
sessions, for the students in Week 1, via lectures within the
Medical School and small group­facilitated sessions within
the community. In Week 2, students prepared their lessons.
During Weeks 3 and 4, the students delivered the teaching to
the primary school pupils.
Six stations, with two students per station, were arranged
at the schools. Themes for the activities or stations are based
on the "Teddy Bear Hospital" (European Medical Students
Association, 2005). These include Oral health, It's an emer-
gency/people who help us, Broken bones and Bandaging
Station, What-a-Doctor-Uses/Medication, Teddy Surgery,
and What's inside my body. Students are encouraged to be
creative in developing the sessions with the aim of reducing
the anxiety children experience of doctors and the hospital
environment through fun, and within a safe learning environ-
ment. The Curriculum for Excellence learning intention and
success criteria (Learning and Teaching Scotland, 2009) were
also communicated, and included good lifestyle habits, such
4 SAGE Open
as healthy eating, the value of exercise, and encouraging chil-
dren to be healthy and to learn more about the human body.
The aim is to supplement the experiences of children and
young people aged 3 to 18 years throughout their education.
Resources are shared between the school of medicine and
nursing, dental hospital, the education department, and pri-
mary school, for example, clinical skills equipment, tooth-
brushes, teddy bears with anatomical parts, and the student's
own creative resources.
Results
The findings reported here are based on the data collated.
Where similarities in participant responses occurred, the
results from the three participant groups, medical students,
primary school teachers, and head teachers, have been com-
bined, as illustrated below. The main themes identified are as
follows: the value of the experience, teaching skill develop-
ment, communication, overcoming challenges, preparatory
session, future opportunities, career progression, and teacher/
pupil observation.
The Value of the Experience
The value of the experience was the main recurring theme
for all participant groups. Medical students described the
experience as developing insight of the skills required for
teaching in future practice; it enriched their medical curricu-
lum; it was "novel" and original in its design while being
different from traditional teaching; students took pride in
being role models for young children, and they were keen to
have a positive impact on the child and the communities that
they were entering; and the interactive nature of the sessions
was beneficial to all children and, in particular, to those chil-
dren with special needs.
Students and teachers reported that the children engaged
with the activities and enjoyed the sessions; the children
appeared keen to build on previous learning and relayed this
to their teachers, demonstrating a sense of pride. The school-
teachers and head teachers expressed gratitude toward the
students and requested further student teaching opportunities
and involvement in the schools; medical students discussed
the importance of being part of the community and having
the opportunity to give back to the community from an early
point in their careers.
We tried to make the station as interactive as possible. We used
a teddy to show the "organs" of the body, I made a fake bottle of
blood to show how much blood goes through the heart . . . a
piece of string to show the length of the intestines . . . a tennis
ball and tights to demonstrate "peristalsis" and a balloon to
demonstrate air flowing from the lungs, as well as visual
diagrams. I think this extra effort was definitely worthwhile
because the children were able to take a "hands on" approach to
the station to aid their learning. (Student 121)
Thank you to all of the students for their hard work, enthusiasm
and positive engagement with the class. (Teacher 2)
The children absolutely loved it. The Students were very good
with the children. The rest of P1 can't wait for their return.
(Head Teacher 4)
Teaching Skill Development
The experience helped the students develop their skill of
teaching while learning from the "experts" and recognize the
importance of applying various teaching techniques for their
future role as a teacher. Students spent time and effort creat-
ing and developing their lesson plans. This generated a sense
of self-achievement and fulfillment.
[The most valuable thing that I will take into my future career/
course] . . . we have a role to educate as well. (Student 157)
Great experience overall . . . gave students hands on experience
with primary children. (Teacher 7)
The pupils had a wonderful time, lots of very well Teddies now!
Thank you for thinking of us! (Head Teacher 1)
Communication
Communicating with young people in the appropriate con-
text and at the developmental stage of the child, simplifying
concepts and long words, and the interactive nature of the
stations were raised as "important points" by students and
teachers.
It was so lovely to see the children so happy and a really good
fun way of improving communication skills. It was so rewarding
when the children spoke about how much they enjoyed our
teaching and even one child described it as "the best day of her
life." (Student 143)
I thought the medical students tried very hard to engage the
children and gave the children positive feedback. (Teacher 10)
It was brilliant--great feedback from staff and children. Many
thanks. (Head Teacher 3)
Overcoming Challenges
During the teaching sessions, the medical students faced
some challenges and developed a range of teaching strategies
to overcome this. For example, they kept the children's atten-
tion by adopting problem-solving techniques to their teach-
ing by adapting their stations; they asked about [the child's]
personal experiences, for example, a relative who had a bro-
ken bone; they gave rewards in the form of stickers as a tech-
nique to reinforce good behavior. These techniques helped
the child interact more with the station. The children brought
Muir et al. 5
their past experiences to the discussion which, in turn, helped
other pupils who were less familiar with health and
well-being.
This experience has helped me appreciate the importance of
flexibility within teaching. As a teacher, of any age group, you
must be able to adapt your teaching style to fit your audience . .
. accept when a concept is too difficult and have the adequate
experience to change your method of teaching. Finally, you
must have the skills to deliver your learning points in an
enthusiastic and interesting way . . . I now realise that learning is
achieved much more effectively by a captivated audience.
(Student 96)
A number of the students interacted very well with the children.
They used terms the children could understand and they had
visuals/props to demonstrate--young children respond well to
this and the students are to be commended for this. (Teacher 8)
Preparatory Sessions
Students indicated that the preparatory sessions, delivered by
the university, helped them understand the project objectives
which in turn supported the development of their lesson plan.
This set the experience in context for the students and know-
ing the relevance of the teaching gave the students an oppor-
tunity to develop as adult learners; thus highlighting the
contribution of the multidisciplinary team involved in the
project.
I liked the strong positive attitude from everyone about the
crosslinking between Medicine and Education and the real
shared belief that what we were doing made a difference to
everyone on both sides. (Student 11)
As a passionate teacher, I very much enjoyed talking about my
craft and equipping the students for working with young
children. (Teacher 14)
The Future
There was a willingness from the students, teachers, and
head teachers to develop the project in the future. Students
suggested teaching older groups of children to see the child's
developmental progression while strengthening their com-
munication and teaching skills.
Have the first teaching session aimed at young kids, e.g., P1 and
the second session aimed at older kids, e.g., P7. The
communication skills needed to interact with each age group
respectively is also different [and] useful for us as students . . .
(Student 52)
We would certainly like to be considered for visits in future
years. This was an excellent activity with enormous educational
and living skills benefits. (Teacher 16)
The children absolutely loved it. The Students were very good
with the children. The rest of P1 can't wait for their return.
(Head Teacher 4)
Career Progression
The child health experience informed students about the
opportunities which exist for working with children in future
years: as a specialist in the field of pediatrics, emergency
medicine, an academic career, and an intercalated teaching in
medicine degree program.
It has inspired me to pursue a career in paediatrics. (Student 121)
Teacher/Pupil Observation
Teachers' relished the opportunity to observe their pupils
interacting with others, seeing how each child adapted to
new situations, information, and challenges.
I was given the opportunity to observe my class, something we
are rarely afforded the luxury of doing since we have no visiting
specialist staff anymore and there are not many external agencies
who offer opportunities to children of primary one age. I could
see how they interacted with other adults. I got the chance to
watch how carefully they listened, how well they how confident
they were in asking their own questions. (Teacher 8)
Discussion
Literature supports the need for health and medical profes-
sionals to develop the skills and practices of a competent
mentor and teacher for lifelong learning (Dandavino, Snell,
& Wiseman, 2007; General Medical Council, 2015). While
this may be the case, it is, at times, questioned whether stu-
dents receive adequate opportunities to develop as teachers.
This project was innovative in its approach to solving this
concern. The value students' placed on opportunities to
develop their teaching skills was evident by their apprecia-
tion of the experience as educators now and in the future.
Learning about teaching early in one's career can help stu-
dents to have confidence in their abilities and thus a stronger
teacher identity they can understand how they themselves
learn.
Communication skills development was a major theme
emerging from the data. More specifically, students discussed
developing teaching skills and communicating in a different
way from their past experiences. Communication and teach-
ing skill development, on the placement served, improved the
students'confidence in their teaching role and for future prac-
tice. Improved confidence and satisfaction from teaching/
communicating effectively is likely to benefit their future
teaching and ultimately enhance the comfort of patients while
improving learning of their future mentees (Crowe, Harris, &
Ham, 2000). Teaching improves communication skills and
6 SAGE Open
the ability to explain concepts such as diseases or treatment in
a person-friendly manner (Prozesky, 2000). Within this study,
medical students' acknowledged that simplifying words and
concepts was one of the challenges they sought to overcome.
Working out how to deliver the information at the right level
for their audience, the students learned valuable and transfer-
able skills (Launer, 2009).
The project was mutually beneficial for both the students
and the primary schools involved, thus maximizing partner-
ship and contribution to the wider community (Dundee City
Council, 2012; Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education, 2009;
Scottish Government, 2012), while drawing upon specialist
expertise. Children were provided with novel and interactive
insight into health care by students with specialist knowledge.
Given the significance of policy documents, it would seem
that education providers can play a leading role in implement-
ing policies for lifelong learning (General Medical Council,
2015; Nursing and Midwifery Council, 2008).
Students, teachers, and head teachers viewed the experi-
ence extremely positively, and the majority expressed a desire
to continue with the project in the future. This study has dem-
onstrated the feasibility of embedding practical teaching for
students into the curriculum. Student data implied that multi-
agency working was clearly valued. Working outside the hos-
pital environment and contributing to the community in a
meaningful way was repeated by the all participant groups.
Goodhall (2012) suggests community participation, com-
munication skills, increased understanding and an apprecia-
tion of nonmedical health support infrastructure in local
communities is valued by students across the globe. The
authors believe the work undertaken by the Dundee project,
further supports that developing working partnerships with
the community has value and meaning for the future.
Although evidence around peer education among students
exist, there would appear to be few opportunities for students
to actively engage in teaching (Alcolado & Alcolado, 2011;
Muir, McTaggart, & Bradey, 2011). Unlike this study whereby
teaching is embedded into the curriculum, ensuring that every
student has an experience of teaching during his or her pre-
clinical years, it appears to be an "opt in" component of the
course. Many students may never be exposed to the "doctor
as teacher" role (Amorosa, Mellman, & Graham, 2011).
The majority of students in this study overcame a series of
"challenges" by creative and problem-solving strategies and
positive reinforcement which correlates with teaching strate-
gies embedded deeply within a pedagogical approach to edu-
cation (Isaksen, Stead-Dorval, & Treffinger, 2011; Sigler &
Aamidor, 2005). Students enhanced their learning, and their
pupils' learning, through the experience by enabling the
more knowledgeable pupils help others to learn (Kaufman,
2003; Vygotskii & Cole, 1978). Although students used vari-
ous teaching strategies, they were unaware of their signifi-
cance for learning.
Although there is an expectation for medical students to
be adult learners, they are not always treated as such
(Goldman, 2009). There was some uncertainty around lesson
planning, and few students expressed a need for more guid-
ance. Adult learning theory supports the view that adults
should take responsibility for, and be able to self-direct, their
learning (Knowles, 2011). The significance of setting the
teaching in context, allowing students to see its relevance
during the preparatory sessions, and giving them the oppor-
tunity to apply themselves to the task creatively seeks to
eliminate this problem.
The integrated nature of the spiral curriculum allows stu-
dents to apply what they have learned in their preclinical
years to their studies in later years (Harden, 1999). Students
valued exploring future teaching opportunities (Muir, 2014).
A notable number also discussed the relevance of the task in
relation to pursuing careers in primary health care, pediat-
rics, and emergency medicine. The teaching experience was
viewed as an innovative and novel way of developing stu-
dents' skills. Many of the students valued the originality of
the experience and enjoyed the variety that it brought to
their course. Teachers' acknowledged the value of being
able to "stand back" and observe their pupils interacting
with others.
Compared with previous work, this qualitative method-
ological approach added value in that it facilitated a rich
exploration of students', teachers' and head teachers' experi-
ence of developing community partnerships and experiences
for students. By building bridges of understanding between
the university and community, and involving students from
the start of their studies, it may be feasible to reduce the gap
so that a genuine understanding of others' perspectives and
efforts is achieved (Whealthall, Graham, & Turn, 1998).
The only theme identified for change, and one which
would enhance the process, was more communication
between the university and the schools regarding the practi-
cal setup of the teaching sessions. This will be addressed in
the next delivery of the program.
Limitations of the Study
The study was intended to explore and gain an understanding
of the project in its complexity and its entirety, as well as its
context, and provide a rich description so that readers can see
whether the study is applicable to their situation or not. It
may in turn become a tentative hypothesis for further research
(Burns, 2000).
Future Considerations
The ultimate aim of this report was to describe learning from
an evaluative inquiry and the outcomes to improve the stu-
dent's understanding of the child, at an early stage in their
career, while educating the young child about their body
through play and interaction. The project is an interactive
and fun way to facilitate students', teachers', and school
pupils' learning, and to help prepare the medical students for
Muir et al. 7
their child health experience in later years. The results from
the project evaluation, and the dedication and ongoing com-
mitment from staff and students, have enabled further cur-
riculum development with local secondary schools and for
the students studying the BMSc Teaching in Medicine inter-
calated degree (Muir & Law, 2014).
Both external (education department and primary
schools) and internal (School of Medicine and the NHS)
partnerships have been created as a result of the project. The
project has benefitted all partners in meeting several other
policies including Interprofessional Learning IPL agenda
(Centre for theAdvancement of Inter-Professional Learning,
2014), Partnerships for Learning Education (Education
Scotland, 2012), and Transforming Lives Through Learning
(Education Scotland, 2013). It supports the Medical School
curricula, and the needs of the primary schools and educa-
tion department.
Through effective collaboration, the University and
Education Department have demonstrated, in a very tangible
way, the importance both institutions place on real and prac-
tical public engagement. In addition, the benefits to the com-
munity, as a whole, are also significant as the children at the
schools not only enjoy their learning but also take some of
the lessons around healthy lifestyle home to their own fami-
lies. They become partners in the process of potentially
bringing about a cultural shift around the importance of
health promotion and having a healthy lifestyle, something
which is greatly needed in a city with real challenges around
the negative impression of deprivation and poverty on its
population health.
This collaborative project embeds community engage-
ment within the undergraduate curriculum while encourag-
ing IPE through multiagency working. The developments
have been mutually amicable between all partners; there are
no significant costs. This project continues to run each year,
and a new Year 3 community school experience will be
delivered this coming year. Future possibilities include
extending the project to include student nurses, dental stu-
dents, or other members of the health care team and an evalu-
ation to look at the impact of programs on the different
stakeholder groups.
