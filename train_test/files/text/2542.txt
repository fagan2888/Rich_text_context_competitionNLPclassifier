Objective. To estimate the occurrence and school-level clustering of drug involvement
among school-attending adolescent youths in each of seven countries in Latin America, draw-
ing upon evidence from the PACARDO research project, a multinational collaborative epi-
demiological research study.
Methods. During 1999-2000, anonymous self-administered questionnaires on drug in-
volvement and related behaviors were administered to a cross-sectional, nationally representa-
tive sample that included a total of 12 797 students in the following seven countries: Costa
Rica (n = 1 702), the Dominican Republic (n = 2 023), El Salvador (n = 1 628), Guatemala
(n = 2 530), Honduras (n = 1 752), Nicaragua (n = 1 419), and Panama (n = 1 743). (The
PACARDO name concatenates PA for Panamá, CA for Centroamérica, and RDO for
República Dominicana). Estimates for exposure opportunity and actual use of alcohol, to-
bacco, inhalants, marijuana, cocaine (crack/coca paste), amphetamines and methampheta-
mines, tranquilizers, ecstasy, and heroin were assessed via responses about questions on age of
first chance to try each drug, and first use. Logistic regression models accounting for the com-
plex survey design were used to estimate the associations of interest.

Dormitzer et al. · Youthful drug involvement in Central America and the Dominican Republic Original research
The aim of this paper is to estimate
the occurrence and school-level clus-
tering of drug involvement among
adolescent youths in each of seven
countries of Latin America, drawing
upon evidence from the PACARDO re-
search project, a multinational collab-
orative epidemiological research pro-
ject. During 1999­2000 the same study
protocol was used for sampling and
data-gathering in each of the partici-
pating countries: five Spanish-heritage
countries of Central America (Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Hon-
duras, and Nicaragua), Panama (which
is sometimes classified as being part
of Central America), and the Caribbean
nation of the Dominican Republic. The
PACARDO name concatenates PA for
Panamá, CA for Centroamérica, and RDO
for República Dominicana.
Background for this report now in-
cludes a growing body of research on
the epidemiology of adolescent drug
involvement in these countries of the
Americas, with prior contributions by
members of our own research group,
and by others. As shown in Table 1,
most of the published evidence is from
Panama and Costa Rica (1­6). For
example, according to the 1996 Pan-
ama National Youth Survey over 40%
of school-attending adolescents had
started to drink alcohol, while a much
smaller proportion had used mari-
juana and inhalant drugs; the use of
cocaine (crack/coca paste) and heroin
was quite rare (1­6). Summarizing ev-
idence from pilot surveys conducted
in anticipation of our PACARDO proj-
ect, Vittetoe and colleagues (4) found
substantial between-country variation
in cumulative occurrence of tobacco
experience, with estimates of tobacco
smoking ranging from 3% of school-
attending youths in the Dominican
Republic to more than 25% of school-
attending youths in El Salvador. How-
ever, in this preparatory pilot work,
the sampling and data-gathering meth-
ods were not held constant across coun-
tries, and methodological differences
may account for observed variation
of the estimates. More recent Global
Youth Tobacco Survey data also reflect
between-country variability in tobacco
smoking experiences within the seven
PACARDO countries (7­9).
Beyond useful epidemiological sur-
veillance research of the type just de-
scribed, there have been a few studies
seeking evidence on suspected causal
determinants for adolescent drug in-
volvement in the seven PACARDO
countries. For example, Vittetoe and
colleagues (4) found that in most of
those countries a higher level of con-
duct problems was associated with
cumulative occurrence of tobacco use,
reflecting what may be a causal rela-
tionship. In studies of youths in Costa
Rica, Sandi and colleagues (3) found
that adolescent drug use co-occurred
with family relations problems and de-
linquency. Delva and colleagues, study-
ing school-attending youths in Panama,
found evidence consistent with "social
contagion" of drug involvement (2).
That is, there was a tangible level of
clustering of drug involvement within
schools, over and above what might be
expected in relation to the composition
of the student bodies (e.g., in relation
to age and sex). Previously, Delva and
colleagues had shown that male stu-
dents in Panama were more likely to
have had opportunities to try drugs as
compared to female students, but that
females were just as likely as males to
initiate drug use once the opportunity
arose (1). This finding from Panama is
consistent with evidence reported by
Van Etten and Anthony, whose epide-
miological research was based on na-
tional surveys of young people in the
United States (10).
Key words
Results. Cumulative occurrence estimates for alcohol, tobacco, inhalants, marijuana, and il-
legal drug use for the overall sample were, respectively: 52%, 29%, 5%, 4%, and 5%. In com-
parison to females, males were more likely to use alcohol, tobacco, inhalants, marijuana, and
illegal drugs; the odds ratio estimates were 1.3, 2.1, 1.6, 4.1, and 3.2, respectively. School-level
clustering was noted in all countries for alcohol and tobacco use; it was also noted in Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Panama for illegal drug use.
Conclusions. This report sheds new light on adolescent drug experiences in Panama, the
five Spanish-heritage countries of Central America, and the Dominican Republic, and presents
the first estimates of school-level clustering of youthful drug involvement in these seven coun-
tries. Placed in relation to school survey findings from North America and Europe, these esti-
mates indicate lower levels of drug involvement in these seven countries of the Americas. For
example, in the United States of America 70% of surveyed youths had tried alcohol and 59%
had smoked tobacco. By comparison, in these seven countries, only 51% have tried alcohol and
only 29% have smoked tobacco. Future research will help to clarify explanations for the ob-
served variations across different countries of the world. In the meantime, strengthening of
school-based and other prevention efforts in the seven-country PACARDO area may help these
countries slow the spread of youthful drug involvement, reduce school-level clustering, and
avoid the periodic epidemics of illegal drug use that have been experienced in North America.

Original research Dormitzer et al. · Youthful drug involvement in Central America and the Dominican Republic
In this paper we seek to add to the
growing body of empirical work on
adolescent drug involvement in the
Americas, with a contribution of evi-
dence from a cross-national collabora-
tive project designed with a deliberate
intent to foster cross-national compar-
isons as well as comparisons within
each of the seven participating coun-
tries. The intent to draw cross-country
comparisons accounts for the PA-
CARDO research project's focus on
school-attending youths in the middle
adolescent years. Elsewhere, we have
proposed to survey youths not in
school within these countries--for ex-
ample, with street-intercept sampling
of youthful pedestrians in plazas,
street markets, and other locations.
However, this sampling method neces-
sarily must be crafted to the individual
circumstances of each country, and
among the PACARDO countries there
is considerable variation in such char-
acteristics as total population, the pro-
portion of the population living in
urban areas, literacy levels, and income
(Table 2). Between-country variation of
this type makes cross-country compar-
ison quite difficult unless the research
protocol is tightly constrained. As
such, in this article, with the goal of
cross-country comparison, we retain a
focus on school-attending youths who
were in middle adolescence during the
closing years of the 20th century. While
we do not wish to minimize the impor-
tance of research on school dropouts
and street children, the drug involve-
ment of school-attending youth is of
interest for many reasons, including
the fact that in the 21st century many of
the leaders of these countries will
likely come from the youthful popula-
tion now attending school.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Background, research design, and
population under study
Building from pilot studies con-
ducted under the auspices of the Inter-
American Drug Abuse Control Com-
mission, the Organization of American
States (OAS), and the Pan American
Health Organization (PAHO), the
PACARDO research group had an ex-
perienced principal investigator (PI)
and research team in each participat-
ing country (Gonzalo B. Gonzalez,
Marcel Penna, Julio Bejarano, Mauri-
cio Sanchez, Kenneth Vittetoe, Ulises
Gonzalez, Juan Alfaro, Rodolfo Kepfer,
Jorge Bolivar Diaz, Manuel Herrera,
Julia Hasbun) as well as a PI and re-
search trainees in the United States
(James C. Anthony, Catherine Dormit-
zer, Chuan-Yu Chen) whose work was
sponsored by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse and the Johns Hopkins
University. Technical assistance and
other expertise were provided by the
OAS (Anna Chisman), PAHO (En-
rique Madrigal), and the Universidad
de Chile (Luis Caris).
A cross-sectional research design
was chosen for the PACARDO project,
with the intent to use the cross-sec-
tional study experience to create ex-
pertise needed for more complex fu-
ture investigations with longitudinal
and randomized intervention designs.
The ministry of education in each
country was able to provide a com-
plete list of public and private schools.
This list of schools constituted the ini-
tial sampling frame from which each
country's population of school-attend-
ing adolescents was sampled.
Our goal was to have all data gath-
ered in 1999, but due to natural disas-
ters in 1999, data-gathering in El Sal-
vador was postponed until calendar
year 2000. A target goal for statistical
precision was 1 400 to 1 500 youths in
each country's sample, for a total sam-
ple size of about 10 150 students. In ac-
tuality, a total of 12 797 students par-
ticipated: Costa Rica (n = 1 702), the
Dominican Republic (n = 2 023), El Sal-
vador (n = 1 628), Guatemala (n = 2
530), Honduras (n = 1 752), Nicaragua
(n = 1 419), and Panama (n = 1 743).
Sampling, participation, and
protection of human subjects
Methods of probability sampling
created a nested structure: youths
within schools, and schools within de-
partments (or provinces) of each coun-
try. From each country's sampling
frame (the complete list of public and
private schools), 55­75 schools were
designated probabilistically, using a
balanced stratified sampling approach
originally developed by Professor
Richard Royall of Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity and described elsewhere (11,
12). In five countries, initially sampled
strata were formed in relation to the
departments of the country; the sam-
pling of schools ensured appropriate
balance in representation of students
from departments with small popula-
tions as well as students from the cap-
ital city and other similarly populous
regions. Given its small geographic
size and densely congregated popula-
tion, El Salvador's sample was drawn
from every department of the country.
After probability sampling to desig-
nate schools, members of the study
team rostered classrooms within each
designated school, seeking to identify
and include all classrooms that in-
cluded 16-year-old pupils. That is, our
intent was to secure a sample with a
mean age of roughly 16 years in each
country. From this roster, one, two, or
three classrooms were randomly se-
lected within each designated school,
based on school size. Rather than pull
out the 16-year-olds for survey, all
youths in the designated classrooms
were recruited for assessment during
a regular classroom session. The result
was an approximate self-weighted
sample (11, 12), with a mean age of 16
years and with an age range reflect-
ing the inclusion of younger and older
youths within these classrooms. In sev-
eral countries, especially within smaller
schools, 16-year-olds are grouped in
classrooms with youths as young as 10
years and as old as young adults, and
our sample reflects these educational
practices. For this reason, age (in
years) is included as a covariate in our
analysis plan.
Strong involvement of in-country
principal investigators, coupled with
support and enthusiasm within the
ministries of education and health, re-
sulted in all school directors and prin-
cipals agreeing to participate in the
survey. However, for practical rea-

sons, there were several instances that
required designation of comparable
replacement schools, mainly due to
natural disasters, school destruction,
and an occasional mismatch between
the central list of schools maintained
by the ministry and the actual geo-
graphic location of the school. For ex-
ample, we encountered listed schools
that had been relocated due to damage
caused by hurricane winds, water, or
mud slides. Occasionally, a listed
school was found to cater solely to
adult learners (i.e., no students age 16
years). When this occurred, a similar
school was selected at random from
the same department of the country,
with selection procedures modeled
after those used to select replacement
schools for the Monitoring the Future
survey of school-attending youths in
the United States (13). In actual prac-
tice there were replacements of this
type in only three countries: El Sal-
vador (four schools), Honduras (three
schools), and Nicaragua (three schools).
There was 100% participation by the
initially designated schools in Costa
Rica, the Dominican Republic, Guate-
mala, and Panama.
In addition to this excellent school-
level participation, there was very
good participation by students in the
classrooms designated for sampling.
The PACARDO project's "passive"
parental consent process involved con-
tact with parents via a letter from the
school director, sent home on the days
prior to the assessment session; no
parental signature was required. This
letter explained the purposes and con-
tents of the survey, and it instructed
parents to advise their children to opt
out of the survey if they so chose.
"Opting out" involved allowing the
youth to mark a symbol to designate a
missing value for all questions on the
survey form. During the assessment
session an active assent process was in
place; youths could decline to answer
any and all questions if they did not
wish to participate, even if their par-
ents had consented to allow them to
participate. In actual practice, nonpar-
ticipation in this form was atypical:
only 2 students marked missing value
symbols for all survey item responses,
and 143 students marked missing
value symbols for all survey items re-
lated to drug exposure opportunities
and actual use. Thus, the survey team
achieved participation by more than
98% of the designated sample of
school-attending youths. In theory,
student-level nonparticipation also
might have occurred if parents in-
structed their children to stay home
from school on the posted days of as-
sessment. This practice, if it occurred,
seems to have been rare. Based on
classroom-level data provided by
teachers, student absenteeism rates
were not unusual on the days of as-
sessment, that is, in a range of 5% to
7% in Costa Rica and Panama, with
even lower absenteeism rates in the
other countries surveyed.
The overall study protocol was ap-
proved by a United States National In-
stitutes of Health initial review group,
which reviewed scientific merit and
public health significance of the work
prior to award of National Institute on
Drug Abuse funds, as well as human
subjects protections. The protocol was
also reviewed and approved by the In-
stitutional Review Board ("Human
Ethics" IRB) of the sponsoring univer-
sity in the United States (Johns Hop-
kins University), and by independent
human subject committees in all seven
countries where the school surveys
were completed.
Assessment procedures, including
a three-part assessment protocol
Each country's leadership team re-
cruited and trained field research staff
according to a standardized PACARDO
research project protocol, and also dis-
patched a pair of assessors (a lead
assessor and an assistant) to each des-
ignated school. The standard multi-
country protocol required the asses-
sors to visit the school for an initial
assessment session of 60 to 90 minutes
within a designated classroom, and
then to return for a second session,
also of 60 to 90 minutes, that sought to
assess the youths from that classroom
who had been absent on the first day.
On the day of the first visit the asses-
sors met and answered questions
posed by the school director or princi-
pal, and laid out an assessment sched-
ule, typically with no more than one
classroom-based assessment session
completed each morning and one
completed each afternoon. In some of
the larger schools, up to three days of
work were required to complete the
assessment process.
Within each designated classroom
the lead assessor and the assistant fol-
lowed the PACARDO research pro-
ject's three-part assessment protocol,
which was designed to improve the
quality and accuracy of the study evi-
dence. For the first part, the school di-
rector brought the assessors to the
classroom and introduced them to the
teacher and youths seated in the class-
room. The school director, teacher,
and assistant assessor then left the
classroom in charge of the team's lead
assessor. While the lead assessor was
introducing the survey to the youths,
the assistant provided the teacher with
instructions about completion of stan-
dardized ratings (described below);
once the teacher started to make these
ratings, the assistant returned to assist
the lead assessor in the classroom.
Within the classroom the lead asses-
sor's first tasks were to describe the sur-
vey and to work through issues of trust
and rapport, prior to distribution of
the preprinted questionnaire form. All
items on this questionnaire were sub-
jected to a translation-backtranslation-
harmonization process that helped
promote comprehension of the Spanish-
language survey items by the partici-
pating youths. The questionnaire was
group-paced but self-administered.
This first part of the assessment proto-
col was structured in a manner that ac-
tually encouraged the youths to voice
concerns about the anonymity and con-
fidentiality of the study data; our idea
was that these concerns should be
made public and discussed, with reso-
lution in the form of increased trust
and rapport. A regime of drug pro-
hibition is in place within each par-
ticipating country, as it is within the
United States, so the accuracy and
completeness of the self-report youth
survey data depended on the youths
404 Rev Panam Salud Publica/Pan Am J Public Health 15(6), 2004
Original research Dormitzer et al. · Youthful drug involvement in Central America and the Dominican Republic
being confident that their answers
would be anonymous. In addition, ex-
plicit assurance was needed that the
survey results on illegal drug activities
would be reported in a manner that
would thwart repercussions at the in-
dividual level and at the school level.
At the individual level, an undesirable
repercussion could be an arrest for il-
legal drug use as reported in the sur-
vey; at the school level, the police
could try to use the survey results to
identify schools with high levels of
drug use and then send undercover
police cadets to those schools in an ef-
fort to apprehend drug users, as has
been done in the United States. The as-
sessors explained our study proce-
dures for ensuring protection against
this type of repercussion, as well as the
procedure for marking a missing value
symbol (a circled dot) whenever a
youth wished to skip any or all survey
questions.
The formal survey session started
after the assessors worked through
these trust and rapport issues. The lead
assessor walked through the classroom
and distributed a stack of anonymous
preprinted questionnaire forms as well
as survey pencils. Youths were invited
to take any preprinted form in the
stack (top, bottom, middle), as an addi-
tional safeguard and privacy protec-
tion. That is, the youths selected their
own forms; they were not preassigned.
After distribution of the forms, the lead
assessor read out a set of scripted, IRB-
approved sentences to formalize the
youth assent process. Here again, the
lead assessor advised the youths that
they had the right to skip any or all sur-
vey questions, and that they could
mark a missing value symbol when-
ever they wished to skip a question. As
described above, there were youths
who declined to participate (i.e., they
marked every question with the miss-
ing value symbol), and there were
youths who declined to answer ques-
tions about illegal drug involvement
(i.e., they marked the drug use ques-
tions with the missing value symbol,
but they gave valid responses to the
other survey questions.).
The second part of the protocol in-
volved the actual assessment, as struc-
tured by 19 zones or modules in the
preprinted PACARDO questionnaire.
The lead assessor secured the youths'
attention and worked through each
page of the questionnaire, module by
module, reading aloud each question
so as to group-pace the process of as-
sessment. As the assessor read each
question, the students followed along
and marked their own answers. The
assistant helped to ensure that privacy
was respected and order was main-
tained, such as by providing quiet an-
swers to idiosyncratic questions from
individual students. This approach
was designed to overcome interindi-
vidual variations in literacy, and it was
also intended to reduce what some-
times occurs as "racing" to the end of
a self-administered questionnaire and
resultant marking errors.
Construct domains covered in the
224-item standardized PACARDO self-
report questionnaire are listed in Table
3, along with illustrative items and
scales. Initial modules assessed gen-
eral health constructs and social adap-
tation, such as are tapped by questions
about headaches, positive moods, and
getting along with other youths. These
first modules help reinforce the idea
that our research is focused on youth
health and well-being in general, with
illegal drug activities being only one
area of concentration. The first ques-
tions about affiliation with drug-in-
volved peers appear in the 8th mod-
ule, after 88 questions on other aspects
of youth health and well-being. Ques-
tions about the youth's own drug in-
volvement begin at PACARDO ques-
tion 162 in the 15th module, which
starts out asking about legal consump-
tion of chicha (a widely consumed in-
digenous alcoholic beverage typically
made via fermentation of maize or
other local plant material), alcoholic
beverages in general, and tobacco.
Subsequent modules address illegal
drugs (e.g., marijuana, coca paste),
prior to a concluding 20-item module
modeled after Johanson's Behavioral
Repertoire Rating Scale (14).
Unlike prior survey forms used in
Latin America, such as the Drug Use
Screening Inventory (DUSI), the PA-
CARDO questionnaire's nondrug mod-
ules are heterogeneous with respect to
item content. Whereas each DUSI
module taps just one domain of con-
structs and all items in the module are
about that domain, each PACARDO
module contains a mix of topics. For
example, items about health are mixed
together with items about social adap-
tation. In addition, the DUSI items are
all true/false or yes/no items, with a
"yes" response indicating the presence
of a problem (e.g., irritable mood). In
contrast, PACARDO items were writ-
ten with a mix of yes/no responses
such that "yes" sometimes indicates
the presence of a problem (e.g., "Do
you feel sad a lot?") and sometimes
the absence of a problem (e.g., "Dur-
ing the past six months, have you slept
well?"). The PACARDO approach is
based on psychometric assessment
principles that seek to reduce stereo-
typical response-marking tendencies
and related survey response errors. In
contrast, the DUSI approach may yield
higher scale-level internal consistency
coefficients (e.g., Kuder-Richardson
formula 20 for Cronbach's alpha), but
the greater internal consistency may
be induced by stereotypical response-
marking tendencies of the individual
student (15, 16).
The third part of the protocol was
the closing session, during which the
assessors collected the completed ques-
tionnaires in a manner that helped
promote a sense of confidentiality. Spe-
cifically, a large envelope was passed
around, and students dropped their
completed survey forms into the enve-
lope with no one being able to identify
the specific form deposited by an indi-
vidual student. The assessors sealed
and packed away the envelope before
engaging in closing exercises that in-
cluded expressions of gratitude and
hope that the youths would agree to
participate in future assessments of
this type. Youths were allowed to keep
the survey pencils as a token of our ap-
preciation for their participation.
While the students were completing
the PACARDO questionnaire, the
classroom teacher worked on a sur-
vey-related task outside the classroom.
The survey team had arranged for the
teacher to create a list of absentee stu-

dents (i.e., students on the classroom
roster but who were absent on the date
of assessment), and to rate these stu-
dents as well as a subsample of all
other students on the roster. This set
of ratings followed a scripted, stan-
dardized rating procedure called the
Teacher Observation of Classroom
Adaptation--Revised (TOCA-R), which
the PACARDO project team translated
into Spanish, back-translated into Eng-
lish, and harmonized for Spanish
language use in this project (17). The
teachers also completed a standard-
ized PACARDO rating form on the
classroom, school, and school neigh-
borhood environment. This form,
called in Spanish the Medio Ambiente
Escolar (MAMBI), was devised in
Spanish for the PACARDO project,
and has helped the project team un-
derstand the characteristics of the
schools, the classrooms within the
schools, and the neighborhood sur-
roundings of the school (e.g., residen-
tial, industrial, commercial). Results
from the TOCA-R and MAMBI will be
integrated within future PACARDO
project reports.
The process of translation, back-
translation, and harmonization of the
PACARDO survey questionnaire,
TOCA-R, and MAMBI items involved
all leaders listed as coauthors of this
report and their local area colleagues,
as well as pilot testing within these
countries. This process helped refine
the assessments. For example, in most
countries there was a question on well-
being: "Ha estado todo bien contigo?"
For Costa Rica, however, the following
phrasing of the question was deemed
more appropriate: "Ha estado todo
bien o pura vida con vos?" (Copies of
the PACARDO youth questionnaire,
TOCA-R, and MAMBI can be obtained
by sending an e-mail to the corre-
sponding author.)
Key response variables
and covariates of interest
Key response variables in this study
report have been measured by PA-
CARDO items on age at first drug ex-
posure opportunity (e.g., "Regarding
the drug marijuana, how old were you
when you first had a chance to try mar-
ijuana?") and age at first actual drug

use (e.g., "How old were you when you
first tried marijuana?"). These ques-
tions were asked about each drug of in-
terest during modules 15 through 17 of
the PACARDO questionnaire. In this
report, valid age values given in re-
sponse to these questions have been
dichotomized to reflect ever/never ex-
periences, coded as 1/0 responses. Par-
ticipants who indicated that they had
never experienced a chance to try the
drug are coded "0" on the drug expo-
sure opportunity variable, and those
who reported a chance were coded as
"1." Those who indicated that they had
never used the drug were coded "0" on
the drug use variable, and drug-using
youths were coded "1." Drugs of inter-
est are: alcoholic beverages, tobacco, in-
halant drugs, and illegal or controlled
drugs such as marijuana, crack, coca
paste, heroin, and ecstasy. "Extramed-
ical use" of tranquilizers was assessed
by asking a Spanish translation of this
question: "Regarding the drugs di-
azepam, alprazolam, chicota, or other
tranquilizers, how old were you when
you first had the opportunity to try
tranquilizers or other sedatives for
other than medical reasons?" (Chicota is
a slang term for tranquilizers.)
Key covariates of interest are age
(in years), sex, country, and private vs.
public school type. Country is a multi-
nomial variable, and public/private is a
dichotomous variable, with values from
an administrative database created by
the survey team. For example, the as-
sessors logged an entry for each school
to indicate whether it was public or pri-
vate. Checked against the Ministry of
Education listing of schools, this vari-
able was used in the following analy-
ses. Sex (male/female) and age in years
are from standardized self-report PA-
CARDO items on these characteristics.
Relationships between the PACARDO
drug involvement constructs and the
other PACARDO constructs listed in
Table 3 will be the subject matter for fu-
ture reports from our research group.
Data processing and quality control
After data collection, all survey data
were keyed to disk, with 100% veri-
fication. This double-entry process
was completed using a standardized
Epi Info computer software (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, Georgia, United States) data-
base created and applied in all seven
countries.
As in prior studies of youthful drug
use, questions on a fake drug ("Ca-
drina") were included within the
PACARDO questionnaire. Among the
12 797 respondents, only 0.7% reported
an opportunity to use Cadrina, and
0.4% reported actually using this fake
drug. In our reported epidemiological
estimates we have excluded responses
from these youths, under the assump-
tion that misstatements about a fake
drug may signal presence of falsely
positive reports about other drug ex-
periences or general response errors in
the questionnaires completed by these
participants. For this study report we
have also excluded responses from the
2 youths who opted out of the survey
by marking all responses as missing
values and the 143 youths who opted
out of all drug involvement responses.
Data analysis plan
For this report the epidemiological
parameters of central interest involve
two things: (a) the occurrence of
youthful drug involvement and (b)
school-level clustering of youthful
drug involvement. Drug involvement
encompasses the initial drug expo-
sure opportunity as assessed via PA-
CARDO self-report items on first
chance to try each drug of interest as
well as the actual use of each drug, as-
sessed by corresponding PACARDO
self-report items.
The occurrence of youthful drug in-
volvement is gauged in relation to cu-
mulative incidence (CI) within the life
histories of the participants, up to and
including the date of assessment. In
drug research and psychiatric epi-
demiology this CI estimate is some-
times called "lifetime prevalence," but
this term is somewhat misleading be-
cause a prevalence parameter can be
affected directly by both the average
incidence of an event or characteristic
within a study base and the average
duration of the event within the study
base (18). In contrast, cumulative inci-
dence (CI) of an event or characteristic
in the study base is evaluated across
the interval of each participant's life
up to the date of assessment, and it is
not at all influenced by the average
duration of the event or characteristic
during the span of the participant's life
unless there is attrition due to high
case fatality rates or similar removals
from the population under study. It
may be noteworthy that cumulative
incidence of drug use for a study base
defined in terms of a probability sam-
ple of school-attending youths may
not be the same as cumulative inci-
dence for a study base defined in
terms of a cohort of zygotes after fer-
tilization or in terms of a cohort of live
births (19, 20). If drug exposure or drug
use has caused or is otherwise associ-
ated with premature school-leaving or
premature death, the CI estimate from
the PACARDO survey will tend to be
lower than the CI derived from a hy-
pothetical follow-up of a specific con-
ception cohort or birth cohort in the
participating countries. We will return
to this "limitation" of the PACARDO
survey estimates in the discussion sec-
tion of this report.
For this study, cumulative incidence
has been estimated with 95% confi-
dence bounds (CBs) derived by means
of Taylor series linearization, as imple-
mented via svymean procedures with
the Stata software (StataCorp, College
Station, Texas, United States). Cumu-
lative incidence ratios (CIRs) have
been estimated via odds ratios using a
corresponding STATA svylogit proce-
dure (e.g., to make cross-national com-
parisons in cumulative incidence, with
covariate adjustment for age and sex).
In most countries there were some
missing responses to questions about
drug use. We made CI estimates with
two approaches: (1) with missing re-
sponses coded as "0," as if the youth
had not used the drug; and (2) with
missing responses excluded from both
the numerator and the denominator of
the CI. Only in Panama and in the Do-
minican Republic did this second ap-
proach yield appreciably different CI

estimates. Therefore, in our table we
have reported CI estimates from the
first approach only, but in the footnote
to the table we have provided the esti-
mates for Panama and the Dominican
Republic wherever we found appre-
ciable differences.
Clustering of drug involvement has
been gauged in the form of the pairwise
cross-product ratio estimate from the
alternating logistic regressions, a proce-
dure devised by V. Carey in an elabora-
tion of the generalized estimating equa-
tions methods developed by K.Y. Liang
and S. Zeger (21­25). In a series of re-
cent contributions published in the
American Journal of Epidemiology, the
Journal of Epidemiology and Community
Health, and elsewhere our research
group has described this novel ap-
proach to epidemiological investiga-
tions on nonrandom clustering of
health-related events and characteris-
tics, and has provided a detailed intro-
duction to the alternating logistic re-
gressions (ALRs) and the pairwise
cross-product ratio (PWCPR, also
known as the pairwise odds ratio,
PWOR), as estimated using ALR meth-
ods (2, 26­30). In brief, analogous to the
contrast between a household-level
conditional probability or secondary at-
tack rate versus a communitywide un-
conditional attack rate, our PWCPR es-
timates indicate whether there is a
nonrandom clustering of drug involve-
ment within schools of each country,
with co-occurrence of drug involve-
ment among youths who are sampled
within the same schools of a country as
compared to co-occurrence of drug in-
volvement by youths sampled from dif-
ferent schools within that country. As
with the null value of 1.0 for an odds
ratio or a cross-product ratio from a 2×2
table, a PWCPR estimate exceeding the
null value of 1.0 is a signal of nonran-
dom clustering of drug involvement
within schools. This nonrandom clus-
tering may reflect person-to-person dif-
fusion of drug involvement or "social
contagion" processes, as discussed re-
cently by Petronis and Anthony (30).
The ALR estimation procedures for this
study have been implemented using the
PROC GENMOD command of the SAS
System software (Version 8.2, from the
SAS Institute, Carey, North Carolina,
United States), which yields generalized
estimating equation solutions and esti-
mates of the PWCPR and its 95% CB.
RESULTS
Table 4 provides a description of the
nationally representative sample of
the 12 797 school-attending adoles-
cents, aggregated across the seven PA-
CARDO countries, as well as descrip-
tions of the study sample within each
participat-ing country. As shown in
Table 4, the 12 797 students were al-
most evenly split between males and
females. Honduras had the highest fe-
male representation, 61%, and El Sal-
vador had the lowest female represen-
tation, 43%. The mean student age for
all countries was 16.0 years. About 76%
of the sample was within the target age
of 15­17 years, and 93% of the sample
was between 14 and 18 years of age.
Tables 5 and 6 present estimates and
95% confidence bounds (CBs) for the
cumulative incidence of experience
with each of the major drug groups
under study, specific for each of the
seven PACARDO countries. Alcohol is
the most commonly used drug. At the
high end, an estimated 81% of youths
in the Dominican Republic reported
having consumed alcoholic beverages
at least once. In contrast, an estimated
34% of youths in El Salvador reported
drinking. Tobacco was the next most
used drug but had considerably lower
cumulative incidence estimates: e.g.,
47% of youth in Costa Rica had
smoked tobacco at least once, as com-
pared to 20% in Panama.
The next most commonly used drug
was either marijuana or an inhalant
drug such as cobbler's glue or gasoline
or diesel fuel. In Guatemala, Nicara-
gua, and Panama there were essen-
tially comparable CI estimates for use
of marijuana and use of inhalants.
That is to say, within each country, the
95% confidence bounds for the mari-
juana and inhalants CI estimates had
an overlap. In Costa Rica and El Sal-
vador, marijuana CI estimates were
higher than those for inhalant use.

Original research Dormitzer et al. · Youthful drug involvement in Central America and the Dominican Republic
lic and Honduras, CI estimates for in-
halant use were higher than CI esti-
mates for marijuana use.
The aggregate response for "any il-
legal drug involvement" was defined
as exposure opportunity or use of
marijuana, crack/coca paste, ecstasy
(methylenedioxymethamphetamine,
or MDMA), methamphetamines, or
heroin. Possibly the most interesting of
the estimates on illegal drug use can
be seen in relation to estimated transi-
tion probabilities in the sequence from
a chance to try the drug to actual drug
use. The conditional probability of
making a transition to use once op-
portunity has occurred are estimated as
90% for alcohol and as 80% for tobacco.
For illegal drugs the conditional proba-
bilities estimates are much lower: 48%
overall, with a range from 52% for mar-
ijuana to 38% for crack/coca paste.
Investigators on our study team did
not expect to find much exposure op-
portunity nor actual use of ecstasy or
heroin: 66 ecstasy users and 87 heroin
users were found in this sample. There
was a large span in the CI estimates
for extramedical use of tranquilizers,
ranging from 2% in Panama to 15% in
Nicaragua.
Tables 7 and 8 show the results of the
multiple logistic regression analyses
and provide summary estimates for
the strength of the association between
drug involvement and demographic
features. Overall, boys were more
likely to have used all drugs except for
methamphetamines, where no sex dif-
ferences were found (that is, in this in-
stance, the associated P value is 0.05 or
greater, and in addition the 95% confi-
dence bounds trapped the null value of
1.0). Boys were less likely than females
to report extramedical tranquilizer use.
Younger students, that is, those 10 to
14 years old, were less likely to report
use of some drugs, as compared to
students 15 to 17 years old. However,
with respect to inhalants, ecstasy,
methamphetamines, and tranquilizers,
there was no age-related variation in
this contrast of younger and middle
adolescents (here, P > 0.05). Youths
who were 18 years of age or older were
more likely to use all of the drugs
except for alcohol, tobacco, and in-
halants, where no differences were
found (here again, P > 0.05). Private
school attendance was associated with
larger CI estimates for use of alcohol,
tobacco, marijuana, and crack/coca
paste (all P < 0.05), but not for inhal-
ants, ecstasy, methamphetamines/
amphetamines, and tranquilizers,
where no differences between public
and private schools were found (i.e.,
P > 0.05 and the 95% CB entrapped the
null value of 1.0).
Figure 1 presents evidence on the
magnitude and precision of our study
estimates on school-level clustering of
drug involvement, as reflected in point
estimates for the pairwise cross-prod-
uct ratios (PWCPRs) from the alternat-
ing logistic regressions as well as 95%
confidence bounds. There was note-
worthy school-level clustering of alco-
hol use as well as tobacco use: all
PWCPR estimates and lower 95% con-
fidence bounds are above the null
PWCPR value of 1.0 (Figure 1), and the
associated P values all met the conven-
tional standard for statistical signifi-
cance of an estimate (i.e., P < 0.05, P
values not shown in the figure). In
contrast, for only two countries was
there evidence of school-level cluster-
ing of inhalant drug use, although all
point estimates were above the null
value of 1.0. In Costa Rica and in the
Dominican Republic, the P values as-
sociated with the PWCPRs were statis-

grouped into a single category, there
was noteworthy school-level cluster-
ing of illegal drug use in Panama, El
Salvador, and Guatemala. Point esti-
mates for the PWCPR values were

other countries, but in these instances,

DISCUSSION
The main findings of this cross-
national study of school-attending
youths in the PACARDO countries
are summarized in the following six
paragraphs.
First, there is substantial country-to-
country variation in the estimated cu-
mulative incidence of alcohol involve-
ment. When all PACARDO youths are
aggregated, more than one-half of
these youths have had a chance to try
alcoholic beverages, and an estimated
51%­53% actually have consumed
alcoholic beverages at least once. The
largest estimates are from the Domini-
can Republic, where 83%­87% have
had the chance to try alcohol, and al-
most as many have actually consumed
alcohol. The smallest estimates are
from Guatemala, where 28%­33% have
had a chance to try alcohol, and 24%­
28% have consumed alcohol. As noted
in Table 9, logistic regression analysis
with covariate adjustment for age (in
years), sex (male/female), and school
type (public/private) confirms that
these country-to-country variations
cannot be understood as artifacts of
imbalanced samples with respect to
these variables. The smallest associa-
tion (odds ratio estimate) for alcohol
use was 1.9 (El Salvador), with Guate-
mala as a reference. The largest asso-
ciation for alcohol use was 15.9
(Dominican Republic), also with Gua-
temala as a reference. As shown in Fig-
ure 1, estimates of school-level cluster-
ing indicated that alcohol use clusters
nonrandomly within schools in all of
the PACARDO countries. The largest
clustering point estimate is observed
in Guatemala, and the smallest cluster-
ing estimate is observed in Costa Rica.
A second major finding is that
youthful tobacco involvement occurs
less often than youthful alcohol in-
volvement in all of the PACARDO
countries. There is country-by-country
variation in cumulative incidence of
exposure opportunity and actual use.
The largest estimates are from Costa
Rica, where 53%­59% have had a
chance to try tobacco, and almost as
many have actually used tobacco at
least once. The smallest estimates are
from Panama, where 19%­25% have
had a tobacco exposure opportunity,
and 18­23% have consumed tobacco at
least once. Logistic regression analyses
indicate country-to-country variation
in exposure opportunity and actual
use. For example, with the experience
of youths in Guatemala as a reference,
tobacco exposure opportunity and to-
bacco use occur four to six times more
often in Costa Rica. Whereas pilot
studies had indicated a lower occur-
rence of tobacco smoking in the Do-
minican Republic than in El Salvador
as compared to the other countries in-
vestigated, this was not the case in the
present study. Here, with more rigor-
ous adherence to a common cross-na-
tional sampling and survey protocol,
we find that youths in El Salvador are
more likely to have started smoking
tobacco as compared to those in Gua-
temala. Youths in the Dominican Re-
public are just as likely to have started
smoking tobacco as are their counter-
parts in Guatemala. Notwithstanding
these variations in cumulative occur-
rence of tobacco smoking among
youths, as depicted in Figure 1, to-
bacco smoking experience has a non-
random school-level clustering in all
seven PACARDO countries. The larg-
est point estimates for school-level
clustering are observed in Guate-
mala, and the smallest clustering esti-
mates are observed in Costa Rica and
Nicaragua.
Third, with respect to exposure op-
portunity and use of inhalant drugs
such as glues and fuels, cumulative in-
cidence estimates are largest for the
Dominican Republic and Honduras,
and they are smallest for Panama and
Guatemala. In the seven PACARDO
countries as a whole, an estimated
12%-13% of school-attending youths
have experienced a chance to try in-
halant drugs, while an estimated 5%
have engaged in inhalant drug use on
at least one occasion. It is noteworthy
that in Honduras an estimated 16%-
22% of youths have had a chance to try
inhalants but only about 5% have actu-
ally experimented with inhalants. We
cannot say whether this "resistance" to
the opportunity to try inhalant drugs
has been induced by an aggressive
anti-inhalants campaign in Honduras,
although we are aware of considerable
newspaper coverage and publicity
given to street kids' usage of the cob-
bler's glue marketed as Resistol in that
country, as well as other commercially
available volatile substances. With re-
spect to school-level clustering of in-
halant drug use, we found nonrandom
clustering of inhalant drug use in
Costa Rica (PWCPR = 1.5; 95% CB =
1.1­2.1) and in the Dominican Repub-
lic (PWCPR = 1.3; 95% CB = 1.1­1.4),
but not elsewhere.
Fourth, with respect to illegal drug
involvement, we find that marijuana
exposure opportunity and marijuana
use are present but not widespread. In
the PACARDO countries overall, an
estimated 8%­9% (that is, one in 11) of
the school-attending youths have had
a chance to try marijuana, and about
4%­5% (or one in 20­25) of the youths
have actually engaged in marijuana
use on at least one occasion. Estimates
for Costa Rica are about double these
values, a magnitude of variation that
cannot be explained by between-
country imbalances with respect to
age, sex, or type of school. The highest
estimates of nonrandom school-level
clustering were found for marijuana
use in Panama (PWCPR = 3.3; 95%
CB = 2.1­5.0). Tangible clustering was
also found in Costa Rica and in El Sal-
vador, (for both, PWCPR = 1.5; 95%
CB = 1.2­1.9); in the rest of the PA-
CARDO countries, the PWCPR esti-
mates trap the null value of 1.0.
Fifth, relative to what has been ob-
served for alcohol, tobacco, inhalant
drugs, and marijuana, the chances to
try and the actual use of other illegal

a Guatemala's sample serves as a reference against which the other samples are compared. Read the table from left to right, row by row. When the CIR estimate is not different from 1.0, the
cumulative incidence in the listed country is not appreciably different from the cumulative incidence in Guatemala. When the CIR is greater than 1.0, the cumulative incidence in the listed coun-
try is appreciably larger than the cumulative incidence in Guatemala. When the CIR is less than 1.0, the cumulative incidence in the listed country is appreciably smaller than is the cumula-
tive incidence in Guatemala.
drugs are much less common in the
PACARDO countries. Cumulative in-
cidence estimates for crack/coca paste
use ranged from below 1% in Panama
to the 1%­2% range in all other of the
seven participating countries.
Sixth, the estimated occurrence of
extramedical use of tranquilizers var-
ied a great deal between countries,
with the CB estimates as high as 13%­
18% in Nicaragua, and as low as 1%­
2% in Panama. Tranquilizers represent
one drug group that girls were more
likely to use extramedically than were
boys.
There are several issues that merit at-
tention. First, since this study involves
samples of school-attending youths,
caution is required before generaliza-
tion to all adolescents. The rate of youth
leaving school before age 16 varies
among the participating countries. This
variation makes cross-national compar-
isons more difficult. As discussed else-
where, the assessment of drug use also
has its limitations; we must consider
possible overreporting or underreport-
ing by various subpopulations (31, 32).
Youths not in school were excluded
from the sampling frames of the PA-
CARDO research project. Nonethe-
less, as in other countries, such as the
United States, there is good reason to
study the drug involvement of school-
attending youths in the PACARDO
countries. For example, as mentioned
in the introduction section of this arti-
cle, it is most likely that the future lead-
ership of these countries will be drawn
from among youths who remain in
school during their adolescent years.
In the United States the Monitoring
the Future (MTF) survey has examined
drug-taking and related behaviors, at-
titudes, and values of secondary school
students in that country since 1975
(33, 34). The European School Survey
Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs
(ESPAD) examines drug-taking behav-
iors of secondary school students who
are 15­16 years old, collecting compa-
rable data on alcohol, tobacco, and
other drug use. Used together, the
MTF data and the ESPAD data make
it possible to compare trends between
countries (35). The Global Youth To-
bacco Survey (GYTS) is another school-
based survey that assesses tobacco use
and exposure to tobacco among youth
(ages 13 to 15 years) (8, 9, 36). The drug
surveillance data generated by the PA-
CARDO research project adds to the
body of public health evidence already
provided by MTF, ESPAD, and GYTS
for the more established market econ-
omies of the world.
Notwithstanding limitations such as
these, this study has a number of coun-
terbalancing strengths, including the
fact that the PACARDO research proj-
ect represents a first attempt to use the
same methods for cross-national stud-
ies of both legal and illegal drug in-
volvement among adolescents in Latin
American countries. To reduce nonre-
sponse bias, extra attempts were made
to include absentees. Except when pre-
vented by extenuating circumstances,
project staff returned to the school to
assess students who had been absent
the day of the assessment. However, a
bias may still exist as students absent
on all days of assessment are excluded
from the analysis, and their absence
may be the result of heavier drug use.
Future analysis of the TOCA-R ratings
by classroom teachers will help clarify
the differences between the youths
who were present and those who were
absent.
In relation to school survey findings
from other countries as disclosed in
the 1999 MTF and ESPAD reports, our
study's estimates suggest that overall
drug use is generally lower in the PA-
CARDO countries. For example, the
cumulative incidence estimate for alco-
hol use among tenth graders observed
for the United States was 70%, versus
an estimate of 51% found in the PA-
CARDO survey; no comparable ESPAD
estimates have been published. In the
PACARDO survey we found that
29% of school-attending youths had
smoked tobacco at least once. The cor-
responding estimate from the MTF is
59%. Estimates from GYTS ranged a
great deal: overall, for youths in all the
GYTS countries, approximately 33% of
youths in the age range of 13 to 15
years had sampled tobacco. The high-
est estimates of the cumulative inci-
dence of youth who had ever smoked
tobacco, around 80%, were in the
Northern Marianas Islands; the lowest
estimates, around 4%, were in the state
of Tamil Nadu, India. In Latin America
the highest estimates of ever having
smoked tobacco were in Chile, and
ranged from 68% in the city of Val-
paraiso to 72% in the city of Santiago.
In Uruguay, estimates ranged from
39% in the city of Colonia to as high as
57% in the city of Montevideo. In the
city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, 55%
of youth had sampled tobacco. In Peru,
estimates ranged from 46% in the city
of Trujillo to 55% in the city of Lima. In
Bolivia, estimates ranged from 54%
in the city of Santa Cruz to 50% in the
city of Cochabamba. Lower estimates
were found in Venezuela (22%) and
in Cuba (34%). The GYTS estimates for
the country of Costa Rica are some-
what lower than those found in the
PACARDO survey (44% versus 56%);
however, this variation might be ex-
pected, given that the mean age of the
youth in the PACARDO survey was 16
years versus the younger ages of youth
surveyed in the GYTS (8, 36).
As reported in MTF and ESPAD, the
lifetime history of inhalant use among
middle adolescents in 1999 was 17% in
the United States, and it ranged from
1% in Romania to 22% in Ireland. The
corresponding estimate from the PA-
CARDO project is 5%. Lifetime history
of marijuana use was present for an
estimated 41% in the United States,
and it ranged from 2% in Romania and
Cyprus to 37% and 41% in the Czech
Republic and the United Kingdom,
respectively. In the PACARDO sur-
vey, only about 5% of youths had tried
marijuana. Extramedical tranquilizer
use estimates in the PACARDO sur-
vey were similar to those found in
the United States: the estimate from
the PACARDO survey was 7%; the
corresponding value from the MTF
survey was 8%. In the ESPAD survey,
lifetime history of extramedical tran-
quilizer use ranged from a low of 2%,
in Estonia, to a high of 18%, in the
Czech Republic and in Poland (37­39).
The data from this multicountry epi-
demiological surveillance project shed
new light on adolescent drug experi-
ences in all seven of the PACARDO
countries, and in some of the partici-

pating countries this is the first pub-
lished evidence on these topics. These
findings may help motivate public
health officials to give more attention
to extramedical drug use in their plan-
ning and delivery of services for
young people in these countries. With
respect to alcohol and tobacco, sub-
stantial numbers of young people
have started to use these drugs, and
there is school-level clustering consis-
tent with person-to-person spread and
other processes that influence geo-
graphical concentrations of drug use.
Although the use of inhalants and the
illegal drugs is less prevalent in these
seven countries, there is some evi-
dence of school-level clustering, par-
ticularly with respect to marijuana and
other illegal drugs. As such, there may
be a reason to focus attention on pre-
vention and early intervention strate-
gies that discourage sharing and other
modes of person-to-person spread of
illegal drug involvement (28­30). In
light of the relatively low estimates
that we found for marijuana use and
for other illegal drug use, the seven
PACARDO nations are in a good posi-
tion to implement prevention activi-
ties for youthful drug use, before the
young people of these countries expe-
rience the escalated usage levels seen
in Europe, the United States, and else-
where in the world.

Objetivo. Estimar el grado en que el consumo de drogas se produce y muestra una
concentración en el nivel escolar entre adolescentes que asisten a la escuela en siete
países de América Latina. Los datos presentados provienen del proyecto de investi-
gación PACARDO, estudio epidemiológico conjunto multinacional.
Métodos. En el período de 1999­2000, se aplicaron cuestionarios anónimos autoad-
ministrados sobre el consumo de drogas y conductas afines a una muestra transversal,
representativa de la población nacional, que se compuso de un total de 12 797 estu-
diantes en los siguientes siete países: Costa Rica (n = 1 702), El Salvador (n = 1 628),
Guatemala (n = 2 530), Honduras (n = 1 752), Nicaragua (n = 1 419), República Domi-
nicana (n = 2 023) y Panamá (n = 1 743). (El nombre de PACARDO combina la PA de
Panamá, la CA de Centroamérica y la RDO de República Dominicana). Se calcularon
las oportunidades de exposición y el consumo de alcohol, tabaco, sustancias inhaladas,
marijuana, cocaína (crack/pasta de cocaína), anfetaminas y metaanfetaminas, tranqui-
lizantes, éxtasis y heroína sobre la base de las respuestas dadas a preguntas acerca de
la edad en que se tuvo la oportunidad de probar cada una de las drogas, y en que se
probó cada una de ellas, por primera vez. Para estimar las asociaciones de interés se
aplicaron modelos de regresión logística con arreglo a la complejidad de la encuesta.
Resultados. Las siguientes fueron las frecuencias estimadas acumulativas del con-
sumo de alcohol, tabaco, sustancias inhaladas, marijuana y drogas, respectivamente,
en toda la muestra: 52%, 29%, 5%, 4% y 5%. Comparados con las mujeres, los varones
fueron más propensos a consumir alcohol, tabaco, sustancias inhaladas, marijuana y
drogas; las razones de posibilidades estimadas fueron, respectivamente, 1,3; 2,1; 1,6;
4,1 y 3,2. En todos los países se observó una concentración del consumo de alcohol y
tabaco en el nivel escolar; el consumo ilegal de drogas también mostró una concen-
tración escolar en Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala y Panamá.
Conclusiones. Este informe arroja nueva luz sobre las experiencias de los adolescen-
tes con la droga en Panamá, en los cinco países centroamericanos de tradición española,
y en la República Dominicana. En él se presentan las primeras estimaciones del grado
en que se concentra en las escuelas el consumo de drogas entre la juventud de estos
siete países. Cuando se examinan a la luz de los resultados de encuestas escolares en
América del Norte y en Europa, estas estimaciones apuntan a que el grado de consumo
de drogas es más bajo en estos siete países americanos. Por ejemplo, en los Estados Uni-
dos de América, 70% de los jóvenes encuestados habían consumido alcohol y 59% ha-
bían fumado tabaco. En cambio, en estos siete países, solamente 51% habían probado
bebidas alcohólicas y solo 29% habían fumado tabaco. Futuras investigaciones ayuda-
rán a explicar las variaciones observadas en los distintos países del mundo. En el en-
tretiempo, el fortalecimiento de las iniciativas preventivas en las escuelas y otros ámbi-
tos en el territorio de los siete países donde se lleva a cabo el proyecto PACARDO
podría ayudar a estos países a frenar la diseminación del consumo de drogas entre la
juventud, a reducir su concentración en las escuelas y a evitar las epidemias periódicas
del consumo de drogas que se han producido en América del Norte.
