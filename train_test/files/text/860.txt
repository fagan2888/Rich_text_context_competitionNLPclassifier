Excess type 2 diabetes in African-American
women and men aged 40­74 and socioeconomic
status: evidence from the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
Jessica M Robbins, Viola Vaccarino, Heping Zhang, Stanislav V Kasl
Abstract
Objective--To examine whether socioeco-
nomic status (SES) explains diVerences in
the prevalence of type 2 diabetes between
African-American and non-Hispanic
white women and men.
Design--Cross sectional study of diabetes
prevalence, SES, and other risk factors
ascertained by physical examination and
interview.
Setting--Interviews were conducted in
subjects' homes; physical examinations
were conducted in mobile examination
centres.
Participants--961 African-American
women, 1641 non-Hispanic white women,
839 African-American men and 1537 non-
Hispanic white men, aged 40 to 74 years,
examined in the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III), a representative sample of
the non-institutionalised civilian popula-
tion of the United States, 1988­1994.
Main results--Among women, African-
American race/ethnicity was associated
with an age adjusted odds ratio of 1.76
(95% confidence intervals 1.21, 2.57),
which was reduced to 1.42 (95% confi-
dence intervals 0.95, 2.13) when poverty
income ratio was controlled. Controlling
for education or occupational status had
minimal eVects on this association. When
other risk factors were controlled, race/
ethnicity was not significantly associated
with type 2 diabetes prevalence. Among
men, the age adjusted odds ratio associ-
ated with African-American race/
ethnicity was 1.43 (95% confidence
intervals 1.03, 1.99). Controlling for SES
variables only modestly aVected the odds
ratio for African/American race/ethnicity
among men, while adjusting for other risk
factors increased the racial/ethnic diVer-
ences.
Conclusions--Economic disadvantage
may explain much of the excess preva-
lence of type 2 diabetes among African-
American women, but not among men.
(J Epidemiol Community Health 2000;54:839­845)
Racial/ethnic disparities in the prevalence of
type 2 diabetes are an important public health
issue in the United States. All major racial/
ethnic minority groups in the United States
have higher prevalences of diabetes than
non-Hispanic white people.1 2 Diabetes preva-
lence is increasing in all population groups in
the United States, but this increase seems to be
greater in minority groups.3 The excess preva-
lence of type 2 diabetes is particularly striking
among African-American women, and contrib-
uted to their declining life expectancy during
the 1980s.4
In contemporary industrialised societies,
including the United States, there is an inverse
relation between socioeconomic status (SES)
and type 2 diabetes prevalence.5 Given the
racial/ethnic disparities in SES in the United
States, SES diVerences could account for some
of the racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes
prevalence. However, several studies have con-
cluded that racial/ethnic disparities in type 2
diabetes continue to be significant after con-
trolling for SES as well as other risk factors.6 7
We tested the eVects of controlling for three
major SES variables--income, education, and
occupational status--on the racial/ethnic in-
equalities in type 2 diabetes observed between
African-American and non-Hispanic white
women and men aged 40 to 74 years in the
Third National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES III). In addition, we
examined the extent to which risk factors that
are often identified as potential targets for pub-
lic health intervention, including body size,
physical activity, diet, and tobacco and alcohol
use, mediated the association between race/
ethnicity and type 2 diabetes after controlling
for SES.8
Methods
NHANES III is the most recent in a series of
surveys conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics designed to assess the health
and nutritional status of the non-
institutionalised civilian population of the
United States. NHANES III was carried out
between 1988 and 1994. African-Americans
and subjects aged 60 and over were oversam-
pled. Face to face interviews were conducted in
the households selected, and all subjects were
invited to participate in medical examinations
conducted in mobile examination centres con-
venient to the subjects' residences. Medical
examinations in the mobile examination cen-
tres for subjects aged 40 to 74 years included
oral glucose tolerance tests, unless the subject
reported use of insulin.9

VARIABLE DEFINITION
Race/ethnicity
Each respondent was asked whether the
subject's national origin or ancestry was
Mexican/Mexican-American or other Latin
American or Spanish, and which of four
choices (Aleut, Eskimo, or American Indian;
Asian or Pacific Islander; Black; and White)
best described the subject's race. Those who
answered no to the first question and chose
"Black" were classified as African-American;
those who answered no to the first question
and chose "White" were classified as non-
Hispanic white. All others were excluded from
these analyses.
Socioeconomic status
Education was categorised based on the
subject's reported number of years of educa-
tion. Categories used were: 0­8 years (less than
high school); 9­11 years (some high school); 12
years (high school graduate); and 13 or more
years (some college). Years of education were
unknown for 26 subjects; they were excluded
from analyses including education.
Income was ascertained by asking respond-
ents to select one of 28 categories as best rep-
resenting total combined family income for the
past 12 months. Each subject's income (taken
as the midpoint of the selected range) was then
divided by the applicable federal poverty line
(which varies by calendar year and family size)
to arrive at the poverty income ratio.10 For these
analyses, poverty income ratio was categorised
as: less than 1.000 (that is, below the federal
poverty line); 1.000­1.999; 2.000­2.999;
3.000­4.999; 5.000+; and missing. The "miss-
ing" category included 373 subjects, 7.5% of
the sample.
Occupational status scores were assigned
based on the subject's reported usual occupa-
tion. The scores assigned to each subject were
the mean Duncan socioeconomic index scores
calculated for the major occupational grouping
(as defined by the US Census Bureau in 1980)
into which the subject's usual occupation fell.11
These scores were then modelled as tertiles.
Subjects who did not report an occupation
(127 women and 99 men) were excluded from
analyses using this variable. For women,
alternative models using head of household
occupation or including a category of "no
occupation" were examined; the results were
similar to those presented.
Type 2 diabetes
Subjects who reported use of anti-diabetic
medications were classified as having prevalent
type 2 diabetes, except that subjects who
reported a physician diagnosis of diabetes and
use of insulin prior to age 40 were classified as
type 1 diabetics and excluded from the study.
Oral glucose tolerance tests with a 75 g oral
load were conducted to ascertain diabetes sta-
tus for the remaining subjects. Subjects exam-
ined in the morning were instructed to fast for
12 hours before the examination, and standard
World Health Organisation criteria were used
(fasting plasma glucose greater than or equal to
7.8 mmol/l or two hour plasma glucose greater
than or equal to 11.1 mmol/l). Subjects who
scheduled afternoon or evening examinations
were instructed to fast for six hours before the
examination, and a modified two hour plasma
glucose criterion (greater than or equal to 13.9
mmol/l) suggested by the National Diabetes
Data Group was used.9 Some analyses were
repeated using the 1997 American Diabetes
Association criteria for diabetes.12
Covariables
A number of variables that are known or
suspected risk factors for type 2 diabetes were
examined as possible mediators of the relations
between race/ethnicity and type 2 diabetes.
These included three measures of adiposity:
body mass index (weight in kilograms divided
by the square of height in metres); waist­hip
ratio (the ratio of waist circumference to hip
circumference); and self reported weight at age
25, as a measure of lifetime adiposity. For 158
(3.2 per cent) of the subjects included in these
analyses, weight or height measurements were
not obtained, and values were imputed by the
National Center for Health Statistics using
stratum specific regression models. Sex specific
tertiles were used to model each of these
variables. Physical activity was assessed
through a series of questions regarding walking
("In the past month, how often did you walk a
mile or more at a time without stopping?") and
recreational exercise during the past month.
Each activity was assigned an intensity rating
(defined as metabolic work rate divided by
resting metabolic rate) based on standard
classifications.13 The authors calculated a total
exercise score by multiplying the number of
times that each activity was reported by its
intensity rating and summing the total for all
activities; the log of the score was used in
analyses. Dichotomous variables for whether or
not the subject engaged in any vigorous physi-
cal activity (defined as an intensity rating >
6.0) during the preceding month and whether
they reported being more active or less active
than 10 years previously were also included in
analyses controlling for physical activity. Di-
etary variables (based on 24 hour dietary
recall) included total kilocalories consumed
and saturated fat and total fat as percentages of
total kilocalories. Cigarette smoking (ever
smoker, current smoker, number of cigarettes
smoked currently, and lifetime pack years of
smoking) and alcohol use (any in past 12
months, frequency of drinking, and quantity
consumed on each occasion) were also exam-
ined as potential mediators.
Several confounders were controlled in the
analyses. Age (in years) was controlled in all
analyses. Time of year was controlled because
there was evidence in the literature that season
and/or ambient temperatures could aVect the
results of oral glucose tolerance testing.14­21
Both time of day (categorised as morning,
afternoon, or evening) and reported fasting
times (categorised as low--less than six hours
for morning examinees or less than 4.5 hours
for afternoon and evening examinees, average,
or high--13 or more hours) were controlled as
well. Day of the week (weekend versus
840 Robbins, Vaccarino, Zhang, et al
www.jech.com
weekday) was controlled because of its poten-
tial association with patterns of diet, physical
activity, and stress that are associated with gly-
caemic control. The recorded number of min-
utes between the initial and the "two hour"
venipunctures (which ranged from 86 to 150)
was controlled as well.
Data analysis
All analyses (except the descriptive data shown
in table 1) use sample weights that adjust both
for diVerential probabilities of selection and for
non-response.22 The association between race/
ethnicity and type 2 diabetes was assessed
using logistic regression models in SUDAAN,
version 7.5.2, which uses generalised estimat-
ing equations to adjust for complex sample
designs.23 Three sets of models were examined:
models adjusted only for examination related
confounders and age; models in which one or
more of the SES variables was included in
addition; and models in which potentially
mediating risk factors were also controlled.
Multicollinearity and stability of results were
examined (pages 257­258).24 A number of
sensitivity analyses were conducted, such as
excluding subjects whose diabetes status was
ascertained by non-standard methods (after-
noon and evening examinees), excluding im-
puted data for body mass index, and using head
of household occupation or a separate category
for "no occupation" in analyses of occupational
status in women. There were no meaningful
diVerences in the results observed.
Results
STUDY SAMPLE
Of the 6282 African-American and non-
Hispanic white subjects aged 40 to 74 years
interviewed in NHANES III, 749 did not com-
plete an examination in the mobile examina-
tion centre. Overall response rates were higher
for African-Americans than for non-Hispanic
whites, and were inversely associated with SES,
but did not vary with self reported health
status. Subjects who reported previously diag-
nosed diabetes were only slightly less likely
than others to be examined (85% as compared
with 89%), and SES diVerences in rates of
examination were small. Fifteen subjects who
reported a physician diagnosis of diabetes and
use of insulin before age 40 were excluded as
possible type 1 diabetics. Another 540 subjects
(who did not report use of anti-diabetic medi-
cations) failed to complete the oral glucose tol-
erance test and were excluded from these
analyses. Among those who completed physical
examinations, African-Americans were less
likely to complete the oral glucose tolerance
test, but within racial/ethnic strata there was
little diVerence in income, education, or self
reported health status between those who
completed the oral glucose tolerance test and
those who did not.
The resulting study sample included 2602
women (961 African-Americans and 1641
non-Hispanic whites) and 2376 men (839
African-Americans and 1537 non-Hispanic
whites). The characteristics of the study sample
are summarised in table 1. African-American
women and men had less education, lower
incomes, and lower occupational status than
non-Hispanic white women and men. African-
American women had a less favourable distri-
bution of most of the established risk factors
for type 2 diabetes. African-American men had
a more favourable distribution of body sizes
than non-Hispanic white men, but reported
significantly less exercise. There were also
significant racial/ethnic diVerences in several of
the examination related variables. There was a
higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes among

African-American women and men than
among non-Hispanic white women or men.
WOMEN
Among women (table 2), when only age and
examination variables were controlled, African-
American race/ethnicity was associated with a
76 per cent excess type 2 diabetes prevalence
(odds ratio 1.76, 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI) 1.21, 2.57). When race/ethnicity and
education were evaluated together, the odds
ratio for African-American race/ethnicity was
reduced to 1.59 (95% CI 1.09, 2.31). Control-
ling for occupational status produced almost
identical results (odds ratio 1.58, 95% CI 1.09,
2.28). When poverty income ratio rather than
education or occupational status was added to
the model, the excess prevalence of type 2
diabetes among African-American women was
reduced to 42 per cent (odds ratio 1.42, 95%
CI 0.95, 2.13). The addition of education
and/or occupational status to models including
poverty income ratio was not significant and
did not substantially change the results (data
not shown).
When body size variables were controlled,
race/ethnicity was not significantly associated
with type 2 diabetes if any one of the three SES
variables was included in the model. Including
poverty income ratio in the model almost com-
pletely eliminated the excess prevalence associ-
ated with African-American race/ethnicity,
(odds ratio 1.08, 95% CI 0.68, 1.72). When
each of the other potentially mediating vari-
ables was examined individually (data not
shown), there was no impact on the association
between race/ethnicity and diabetes. Models
controlling for all the mediating variables
further reduced the odds ratios associated with
African-American race/ethnicity (table 2).
When we repeated our analyses using the
1997 American Diabetes Association criteria
for type 2 diabetes, based solely on fasting glu-
cose values, the excess prevalence of diabetes
among African-American women was notice-
ably greater than in the analyses using World
Health Organisation criteria, which are based
on both fasting and two hour glucose values.
Despite this, when both poverty income ratio
and other risk factors were controlled, the odds
ratio associated with African-American race/
ethnicity was no longer statistically significant
(1.27, (95% CI 0.72, 2.25) data not shown).
Because the finding that race/ethnicity was
not an independent risk factor for type 2
diabetes among women after SES variables or
other risk factors were controlled diVers from
the results of other studies,6 7 25 26 additional
analyses were conducted to explore possible
explanations for this discrepancy. Because the
other studies did not control for the examina-
tion related variables included here, we re-
peated the analyses without controlling for
these variables (time of day, time of year, day of
week, reported length of fast, and the recorded
number of minutes between the administration
of the glucose solution and the "two hour"
blood draw). The apparent risks associated
with African-American race/ethnicity were
substantially greater in all cases. In the model
adjusted for age only, the odds ratio associated
with African-American race/ethnicity was 2.16
(95% CI 1.62, 2.89).
Further exploration showed that in this
study, subjects examined during the summer
were less likely to have type 2 diabetes than
those examined during the rest of the year. This
reduced prevalence of type 2 diabetes among
subjects examined in the summer was found in
all four regions of the country, and among both
African-Americans and non-Hispanic white
subjects. African-Americans were significantly
less likely than non-Hispanic white subjects to
be examined in the summer (table 1), both in
the South (where a majority of African-
American subjects lived, and very few examina-
tions were conducted in the summer) and in
other regions of the country. The timing of the
examination was therefore an important con-
founder in analyses examining the association
between race/ethnicity and type 2 diabetes.

KEY POINTS
x Excess type 2 diabetes prevalence among
African-Americans is greater among
women than men.
x The excess type 2 diabetes prevalence
among African-American women is ex-
plained by diVerences in income and
body size.
x Gender diVerences in the associations
between race/ethnicity, body size, and
type 2 diabetes parallel those between
socioeconomic status, body size, and type
2 diabetes.
x Investigators should consider controlling
for seasonal variations in glycaemia,
which seem to have a substantial impact
on diabetes prevalence in NHANES III.

ratio 1.43, 95% CI 1.03, 1.99). The addition of
education to the model reduced this slightly
(odds ratio 1.30, 95% CI 0.89, 1.88), but pov-
erty income ratio and occupational status did
not substantially change the association.
In a reversal of the eVects seen with women,
when potential mediators were added to the
model, the association between race/ethnicity
and type 2 diabetes prevalence was strength-
ened, and there was a significant excess preva-
lence of diabetes associated with African-
American race/ethnicity, regardless of which of
the SES variables was controlled. Body size
variables were again the important added vari-
ables, but among the men central obesity (as
measured by waist-hip ratio) was clearly most
important (data not shown), accounting for
about 80 per cent of the diVerence in odds
ratios produced by controlling for all of these
variables.
We also tested these results when examina-
tion related confounders were not controlled
(data not shown). As with the results among
women, the association between African-
American race/ethnicity and type 2 diabetes
prevalence was inflated, with an age adjusted
odds ratio of 1.66 (1.24, 2.23). The eVects of
the addition of SES and other variables to the
models were essentially the same as in the
models described above.
Discussion
Two studies based on earlier data investigated
the question of whether SES accounts for the
excess prevalence of type 2 diabetes in African-
Americans and concluded that it does not.6 7
Neither of these studies presented gender spe-
cific analyses, and neither examined income
adjusted for family size as a measure of SES.
Davey Smith et al found that among the volun-
teers screened for the Multiple Risk Factor
Intervention Trial, excess mortality from
diabetes among African-American men was
substantially explained by area level income,
and completely explained when other risk fac-
tors were controlled.27
A previous analysis of data from NHANES
III, the same dataset examined here, concluded
that African-American race/ethnicity was sig-
nificantly associated with increased prevalence
of type 2 diabetes in women 25­64 years of age
after controlling for SES.26 Several diVerent
analyses were performed. There are a number
of methodological diVerences that could ex-
plain why the findings of Winkleby et al were
diVerent from those reported here for women.
The most important seems to be that we con-
trolled for the season of the year when the
examinations were conducted, as well as time
of day, day of the week, and fasting times. Win-
kleby et al excluded subjects who reported fast-
ing times of less than eight hours and did not
include any other examination related variables
in their analyses. Season of the year was an
important confounder of the association be-
tween race/ethnicity and diabetes prevalence in
the data we analysed. When examination
related variables were not controlled in our
analyses, the association between African-
American race/ethnicity and type 2 diabetes
prevalence was inflated, although still not
statistically significant after adjustment for
poverty income ratio and mediating variables.
The finding that income, modelled as
poverty income ratio, is more strongly associ-
ated with type 2 diabetes prevalence and a
more important factor in explaining the excess
prevalence of type 2 diabetes among African-
American women than other SES variables is
consistent with other studies, including that of
Winkleby et al.26 Years of education may be less
eVective as a control for socioeconomic diVer-
ences between African-Americans and white
subjects because most of the African-
Americans surveyed were raised in the South
and attended segregated schools characterised
by inadequate resources, undertrained teach-
ers, and truncated school years. Years of
education in such schools provided educational
opportunities grossly unequal to those aVorded
to white subjects.28
Controlling only for age and examination
related confounders, the excess prevalence of
diabetes among African-American men was
substantially less than that among women. This
has been observed in previous studies,29­31
although there are also conflicting findings.7
Controlling for SES substantially reduced the
excess prevalence of diabetes among African-
American women, but not men. Additional
adjustment for possible risk factors for diabetes
had diametrically opposite eVects among
women and men on the association between
race/ethnicity and diabetes, reducing the excess
prevalence of diabetes among African-
American women, while substantially increas-
ing it among African-American men. This
reflected the diVerent racial/ethnic distribution
of these risk factors by gender. African-
American men in NHANES III had lower
body mass index, waist­hip ratio, and weights
at age 25 than non-Hispanic white men, while
African-American women had substantially
higher values for all of these body size variables
than non-Hispanic white women. Our finding
of a significant association between race/

Excess type 2 diabetes in African-Americans 843

ethnicity and diabetes among men after adjust-
ment for risk factors is consistent with the
findings of other investigators.6 7 25
Several investigators have observed sex
diVerences in the eVects of diVerent risk factors
on type 2 diabetes7 8 25 and related metabolic
variables.32 33 Sex ratios in type 2 diabetes
prevalence vary widely between populations,
providing further evidence that environmental
risk factors aVect the sexes diVerently.34 There
are also substantial sex diVerences in the eVects
of diabetes, most importantly on coronary
heart disease.35
While the literature on race/ethnicity, SES
and health has rarely focused on sex diVer-
ences, there is evidence that the health risks
associated with both African-American race/
ethnicity and low SES operate through diVer-
ent pathways in women and men. Obesity is a
particularly important risk factor for diabetes
that is associated with both African-American
race/ethnicity and low SES among women, but
not men.36 37 There is also some evidence that
stress, which is widely hypothesised to play an
important part in the associations between
race/ethnicity, SES, and health,38 39 has diVer-
ent psychological and metabolic eVects on
women and men.40 The relative unimportance
of SES as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes
among men has also been observed in studies
of Mexican Americans.41 42
A number of limitations of this analysis
should be emphasised. Despite extensive ef-
forts in NHANES III to maximise response
rates, substantial non-response did occur.22
Non-response bias occurs where the associ-
ation being examined varies by response status.
There is no obvious reason to anticipate such a
pattern. None the less, the potential for
non-response bias cannot be discounted.
There are important elements of SES that
were not examined in this study. Direct
measures of childhood SES or SES through the
lifecourse and measures of economic assets,
including home ownership, were not available.
Because African-Americans have far fewer
economic assets than non-Hispanic white peo-
ple at the same levels of income or education,
controlling for these variables might further
reduce the apparent excess of type 2 diabetes
among African-American women. It is also
possible that these aspects of SES would
impact on type 2 diabetes prevalence among
men. In addition, the cross sectional nature of
the NHANES III data does not permit us to
exclude the possibility of reverse causality, with
diabetes prevalence impacting family income.
By limiting the diagnosed cases defined as
type 2 diabetes to those reporting use of
anti-diabetic medications and excluding those
who were diagnosed and initiated insulin use
before age 40, this study may have excluded
some type 2 cases. Because the numbers of
diagnosed diabetes cases excluded was small,
this is unlikely to have had any important eVect
on the results.
This is the only study of which we are aware
in which variables relating to the timing and
conditions of oral glucose tolerance tests have
been so extensively controlled. Controlling for
these variables--especially the time of year in
which the examination was conducted--results
in conclusions diVerent from those found by
other investigators, raising the question of
whether there was uncontrolled confounding
in the previous studies. We would argue that
future epidemiological studies should attempt
to control for these variables, unless examina-
tion of the data shows that they are not
confounders in the given study. Our findings
also underline the sex diVerences in the impact
of a number of diVerent risk factors on type 2
diabetes, and the importance of examining sex
specific models.
The results of this analysis suggest that the
well established finding of higher prevalence of
type 2 diabetes among African-American
women than among non-Hispanic white
women in the United States may reflect the
economic disadvantage suVered by African-
Americans, rather than any race specific
genetic susceptibility. They underscore that the
failure to find socioeconomic or environmental
explanations for factors in the explanations for
racial/ethnic disparities in health in any given
analysis is not meaningful evidence that these
diVerences are genetic in origin. The tools we
use to measure the eVects of SES on health are
limited.3 Residual confounding may explain
the persistence of race/ethnicity eVects in many
analyses.43 The health eVects of stressors
related to racial and ethnic discrimination are
another, largely unexplored possible cause of
health inequalities.39 44 45 The elimination of
racial/ethnic inequalities in type 2 diabetes and
other health outcomes in the United States
may require not the tools of the biomedical
laboratory, but those of social, political, and
economic action to reduce economic inequali-
ties and social injustice.
