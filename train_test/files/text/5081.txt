Introduction
In the year 2000, the European Council met in Lisbon to dis-
cuss possible ways of enhancing growth and sustainability
across the European Union (EU). The strategic goal for the
first decade was to create a positive strategy that combines
competitiveness and social cohesion, so that the EU becomes
"the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based econ-
omy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth
with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion"
(European Trade Union Confederation, 2006). To meet these
goals, the targets set by the EU included an overall employ-
ment rate of 70% by 2010, an employment rate for women of
over 60%, an employment of 50% among older workers, and
an annual economic growth of 3%.
This empirical study, which is based in the Republic of
Malta, seeks to gain a better understanding and assessment
of the work motivations of Maltese female workers. Malta is
an archipelago situated in the center of the Mediterranean. It
has an area of 316 km2 and a population of 417,617 (National
Statistics Office, 2011), thus making Malta one of the most
densely populated countries in the world. Malta was admit-
ted to the United Nations in 1964, and became a full member
of the EU and of the Eurozone in 2004 and 2008, respec-
tively. Its major resources are a favorable geographic loca-
tion and a productive labor force. The Maltese economy is
highly dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing, tourism,
and financial services (Falzon, 2011).
To respond to the targets set by the EU, the Maltese gov-
ernment launched a series of initiatives and programs in an
attempt to boost women's participation in the Maltese labor
market. These include fiscal incentives concerning National
Insurance and tax rates, extended maternity leave, the shar-
ing work­life responsibilities program, and the setting up of
the National Commission for the Promotion of Equality
(NCPE) to screen the labor market and make sure that gender
equality regulations are adhered to. However, despite the
fact that the employment rate of females in Malta for the

Understanding and Assessing the Work
Motivations of Employed Women: Insights
Into Increasing Female Participation
Rates in the Maltese Labor Market
Frank Bezzina1, Rose Marie Azzopardi1, and George Vella1
Abstract
This empirical study investigates the work motivations of employed women in the Maltese labor market. A self-administered
questionnaire purposely designed for the present study was presented to a quota sample of 400 women employed in
Malta. Statistical analyses revealed that (a) the most important work motivators are "financial independence" and "earning
money for basic necessities"; (b) the 16 proposed work motivations could be grouped under two internally consistent and
unidimensional factors, namely, "personal and professional development" and "social and economic well-being"; and (c)
that the intention to continue to work in the future was associated with a higher level of "education," and greater levels of
work motivation related to "personal and professional development" and "social and economic well-being." The findings are
discussed and the study provides 10 important recommendations for Maltese labor market policy makers and employers
aimed at boosting the participation of working women. These include a more supportive support system for working
mothers, flexible educational and training opportunities, and tighter enforcement of laws to prevent gender discrimination
and harassment at the place of work and nonobserved economic activity. The study concludes by providing some interesting
avenues for further research.

15-64 age group increased from 33.1% in 2000 to 39.3% in
2010, the percentage reached in 2010 was clearly off target.
In 2011, the employment rate of women in Malta stood at
43.4%, and this represented the lowest employment rate
across all the member states within the EU (Eurostat, 2012).
At the same time, the participation rate of men in Malta com-
pares very well with that registered in other EU member
states. The gender imbalance becomes even more disturbing
when one looks at the percentage of women on corporate
boards of large listed companies, with Malta standing at the
bottom of the league across all EU member states with 3%.
(European Commission, 2012a). This suggests that Malta
needs to strive to implement new and more effective policies
in an attempt to reach EU's 2020 objective set by the Europe
2020 strategy--that of increasing the number of women (and
men) aged 20-64 to 75% by 2020 across all member states
(European Commission, 2012b).
To increase the female employment rate, apart from
attracting the unemployed and the inactive to the labor mar-
ket, it is also important to retain those who are already
engaged. This empirical study seeks to gain a better under-
standing of those factors that motivate Maltese women to
engage in the labor market and to recognize the difficulties
that Maltese employed women have to face to work. In the
light of the findings that emerge, the study will set out to
generate recommendations aimed at better guiding policy
makers when devising strategies to boost the participation
rates of women in the Maltese labor market. The study con-
cludes by providing some interesting avenues for further
research.
Literature Review
Theories of Work Motivation
Work motivation has been defined as "a set of energetic
forces that originate both within as well as beyond an indi-
vidual's being, to initiate work-related behavior, and to deter-
mine its form, direction, intensity, and duration" (Pinder,
2008, p. 11). Various theories of work motivation have
emerged and here we review four broad categories--the
needs-based, cognitive process, behavioral and job-based
theories. These will be described briefly due to space limita-
tions and because comprehensive reviews of work motivation
theories are overwhelmingly available (e.g., Grant & Shin,
2012; Latham & Pinder, 2005; Mitchell & Daniels, 2003).
Needs. The needs-based theories posit that employees have a
drive to satisfy a variety of needs through their work. Accord-
ing to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (1943), employees strive
to satisfy physiological, safety, love/belonging, esteem and
self-actualization needs that are hierarchically ranked, and
once a lower need is satisfied, it no longer serves as a motiva-
tor. In the ERG Theory, Alderfer (1969) grouped Maslow's
five basic human needs into three--existence (E), relatedness
(R), and growth (G) --which however do not necessarily
need to be satisfied in hierarchical order. The Need for
Achievement Theory (McClelland, 1961) focuses on indi-
viduals who strive to achieve their goals and advance in their
organization and identifies three main categories of achieve-
ment motivation--affiliation, authority, and achievement.
Behavioral. Behavioral theories focus on observable behavior
not on psychological processes. The Organizational Behav-
ior Motivation Theory, also known as The Reinforcement
Theory, was developed by B. F. Skinner in 1938. He extended
Ivan Petrovic Pavlov's classical conditioning (stimulus lead-
ing to response) by identifying two types of behavior--the
respondent (classical conditioning mechanism, with limited
applications and use) and the operant (response leading to
stimulus, and hence behavior is actually learnt). This theory
suggests that an individual will behave in a manner that helps
him or her to avoid potential negative outcomes and achieve
agreeable outcomes. Thus, proper management of reinforce-
ment helps chance the direction, level, and persistence of an
individual behavior, and hence, to motivate employees, orga-
nizations need to indulge in systematic reinforcement of
desirable work behavior.
Cognitive process.Cognitive process theories postulate that
people set goals and strategize ways to attain them on the
basis of needs, values, and the situational context. According
to the Equity Theory (Adams, 1963, 1965), employees try to
strike a balance between the ratio of inputs to outcomes in
exchange relationships. It describes how and why employees
react when treated unfairly (e.g., through withdrawal or vio-
lence on others). Vroom's Expectancy Theory (1964) pro-
poses that employees choose to invest in courses of action
after weighing their relative utilities; hence, employees work
harder if their efforts lead to valued rewards. The Goal Set-
ting Theory, presented by Locke and Latham (1990), which
is considered to be the "single, most dominant theory in the
field" (Mitchell & Daniels, 2003, p. 231), posits that for
goals to motivate, they must have clarity (i.e., be specific,
measurable and time-bound), be challenging but realistic,
require commitment (the harder the goal, the greater the
commitment required), provide feedback opportunities (to
clarify expectations, adjust goal difficulty, and gain recogni-
tion) and have attainable task complexity. Bandura's Social
Cognitive Theory (1977, 1986) identifies human behavior as
an interaction of personal psychological processes, behavior,
and the environment. People learn by observing others, and
Bandura established that the following four steps are neces-
sary in the modeling process: attention (to something new),
retention (remember what you paid attention to), reproduc-
tion (translate description into actual behavior), and motiva-
tion (the "will" to imitate the model). According to this
theory, employees with high self-esteem anticipate success
and show more effort and persistence, require feedback and
adopt more effective task strategies (patterns of behavior
Bezzina et al. 3
produced to reach a particular goal) than others. It has been
acknowledged that the social cognitive theory is helpful in
understanding, predicting, modifying, or changing individ-
ual and group behavior (Jones, 1989). The Self-Determina-
tion Theory, which comprises five mini theories (see
Vansteenkiste, Niemiec, & Soenens, 2010), posits that when
the three basic psychological needs of employees--namely,
autonomy (choice and discretion), competence (capability
and efficacy perceptions), and relatedness (feelings of con-
nectedness and belongingness with others)--are satisfied,
employees tend to be more intrinsically motivated and inter-
nalize external goals and objectives (Deci & Ryan, 2000).
More recent research suggests that intrinsic and extrinsic
motivations often coexist (Adler & Chen, 2011). In addition,
when intrinsic and prosocial motivations interact, employees
show higher levels of persistence, performance, and creativ-
ity (Grant & Berry, 2011).
Job-based. According to job-based theories, the key to find-
ing motivation through one's job is to derive satisfaction
from the job content. Herzberg's Motivator-Hygiene Theory
(1959) posits that high levels of hygiene factors such as pay,
status, working conditions, and job security do not create sat-
isfaction but can only reduce dissatisfaction. The motivating
factors that create satisfaction include recognition, responsi-
bility, advancement, autonomy, opportunities for creativity,
and the work itself. The Job Characteristics Theory (Hack-
man & Oldham, 1980) identified five core job characteristics
(skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and
feedback) that vary as a function of three critical psychologi-
cal states (experienced meaningfulness at work, responsibil-
ity for outcomes and knowledge of results), which in turn
influence work outcomes such as job satisfaction, perfor-
mance quality and absenteeism. Within this context, job
enlargement, job rotation, and job enrichment emerge as
three possible ways of enriching the motivational content of
jobs by adding variety and challenge.
All the theories of work motivation have their own
strengths and limitations and despite efforts to develop an
integrated model of motivation, it remains to be seen whether
this is desirable or even possible. In line with this, Grant and
Shin (2012) put forth the following recommendation:
Our own view is that given the complexity of psychological,
social, and situational influences on motivation, researchers are
best advised to develop, test, and elaborate middle-range
theories (Weick, 1974) that are problem-driven--designed to
explain particular phenomena and outcomes, rather than seeking
to generalize to all outcomes (Lawrence, 1992). (p. 515)
Factors Affecting Female Participation Rates
Various factors have been proposed in the literature that
encourage or hinder women to engage in the labor market.
In this subsection, we provide an overview of the foreign
literature on gender roles attitudes, work­life balance, flex-
ible work-arrangements, and the role of significant others in
supporting working mothers. We then focus on initiatives
that have been proposed or implemented to reduce gender
disparity in employment participation rates.
Gender roles and attitudes. Traditionally, the role of the hus-
band was that of the main breadwinner (or primary economic
provider) while the role of women was primarily as home-
makers (Davis & Greenstein, 2009). In the case of neo-tradi-
tional marriages, although the men and women work, men
and women are expected to have goals aligned to work cen-
trality and family centrality, respectively; this being in sharp
contrast with an egalitarian gender role orientation mind-set,
where men and women can aspire equally to both roles
(Fletcher & Bailyn, 2005). Although it was expected that
gender role attitudes would eventually be eradicated in the
new millennium, particularly in the western world, studies at
the start of the millennium showed otherwise (Sjöberg,
2004). More recently, Desai, Chugh, and Brief (2012) pro-
vided evidence of linkages among marriage structure, gender
ideology, and workplace attitudes and behaviors, thereby
unmasking a pocket of resistance to the gender revolution.
They found that employed husbands in traditional and neo-
traditional marriages (a) viewed unfavorably the presence of
women at the workplace, (b) perceived that organizations
with a higher number of female employees operated less
smoothly, (c) that organizations with female leaders are
unattractive, and (d) that they deny female employees the
opportunities for promotion. Desai et al. (2012) argued that
the posture of these men, who represent a potentially large
and influential group, is unlikely to change until the structure
of their marriage changes, something that is highly improb-
able. In an interview, Desai, as cited in Casserly (2012),
argued that hope lies in the hands of the new generation of
mothers and sons. She recommends to stay-at-home mothers
to show their children that even they can participate in the
so-called masculine domain finances whilst ensuring that the
husband shares in the feminine domestic chores.
Work­life balance and flexible working arrangements.Studies
show that stress related to the conflict between work and
family has been increasing (Grzywacs, Almeida, & McDon-
ald, 2002) and more evident in patriarchal societies (Aziz &
Cunningham, 2008). In the EU, a strategy to reduce imbal-
ance was the introduction of the Working Time Directive,
which implemented a maximum 48-working time budget
including overtime (Directive 2003/88/EC of November 4,
2003). The European Quality of Life Survey (Anderson,
Mikuliç, Vermeylen, Lyly-Yrjänäinen, & Zigante, 2009)
found that although Europeans were generally satisfied and
happy with life, the countries in South-Eastern Europe such
as Greece and Croatia had the most problems with work­life
balance. Crompton and Lyonette (2006) found that, apart
from Scandinavian countries, there was no evidence that
4 SAGE Open
state policies in Europe had an absolute impact on men in
taking a larger share of domestic work. In this regard, more
and more women are trying to find working time arrange-
ments that are flexible rather than high powered careers, to
combine family commitments and paid work; however, this
results in poorer job content, reduced training opportunities,
diminished promotion opportunities, and fewer entitlements
to social protection (Connolly & Gregory, 2008; Lyonette,
Baldauf, & Behle, 2010; McDonald, Bradley, & Brown,
2009). Glavin, Schieman, and Reid (2011) found that
although women are able to juggle their work and family
lives just as much as men, they feel guiltier of doing so,
regardless of age, marital status, socioeconomic status or
whether they had children, and even after statistically adjust-
ing for work­family conflict. Women perceive their employ-
mentaspreventingthemfromfulfillingfamilyresponsibilities
and they have negative feelings about boundary spanning
work demands (e.g., answering a work-related e-mail or
phone call), and this role blurring (which emphasizes over-
lapping versus incompatible role domains), which is distinct
from work­family conflict, "may have negative consequences
for well-being" (p. 53).
Significant others in supporting working mothers. An important
role in encouraging and supporting mothers to work is that
played by significant others (often referred to as "strong
ties") such as fathers, grandparents, close friends and older
children, particularly when it comes to take care of their
younger ones (Abela et al., 2012). Millar (2008) also high-
lighted the importance of the relationship with "weak ties"
such as employers. The attitude of employers toward family-
friendly measures and social relationships at work were cru-
cial to enable lone mothers to sustain their employment. She
found that informal cooperation from employers and col-
leagues, as in the case when children were sick, was "a com-
mon theme in managing work, and far more important than
any statutory rights or formal agreements" (p. 10).
Initiatives to reduce gender disparity. Organizations have been
depicted as playing a key role in generating and sustaining
inequality in the workplace (Fernandez & Mors, 2008). Vari-
ous initiatives to reduce gender disparities in the workplace
include maternity leave programs (Kelly & Dobbin, 1999),
merit-based pay practices (Castilla, 2008), and job-training
arrangements (Kalev, 2009); Kalev, Dobbin, and Kelly
(2006) found that practices designed to moderate managerial
bias through training and feedback were the least effective,
practices designed to reduce the social isolation of women
and minority workers to be moderately effective, while pro-
grams designed to establish organizational responsibility for
diversity were the most effective, yet they only produced
modest effects.
Hakim (2004) argued that there are four important factors
that a country must adapt to increase the female involve-
ment in the labor market. These are: (a) ideological reform:
promotions to make females aware of the importance of
employment participation; (b) legislation: increasing female
employment involvement and favoring a free market policy;
(c) fiscal policy: altering tax rates that are attractive to cur-
rent and prospective female employees, and (d) institutional
change: employers offering employees flexi-time or working
from home possibilities, and with schools providing child-
care provision after school hours.
Slocum and Hellriegel (2009) recommended the follow-
ing approach: (a) meet basic human needs, (b) design jobs
that motivate people, (c) enhance the belief that goals can be
reached, and (d) treat people equitably. They also add the
importance of making sure that employees do the type of
employment they applied for, rather than duties that make
them feel underutilized, and to help them be innovative so
that they move away from routine jobs.
The European Commission has recently adopted gender
quotas, which would see women represent 40% of nonexecu-
tive board member positions in public companies by 2018
and private companies by 2020. As the Commission put it
"opening the doors to senior positions will act as an incentive
for women to enter and stay in the workforce, helping to raise
female employment rates . . . and to achieve the targets set by
the Europe 2020 strategy" (European Commission, 2012a).
Women and Work in the Maltese Context
According to the National Commission for Promotion of
Equality [NCPE] (2011), the working environment in Malta
is characterized by a combination of gendered welfare
regime, strong patriarchal social structures, strong family
traditions and Catholic faith. In addition, the Maltese welfare
system is a compromise between the Mediterranean (charac-
terized by traditional gender roles--providing husband and
caring wife), the liberal (comprehensive social welfare) and
the corporatist-conservative (which encourages mother-
hood). The gendered welfare state links with the culturally
constructed ideology, which is still strong in the Maltese
islands. Despite incentives for women to engage in the labor
market, these characteristics are potentially presenting a hos-
tile environment for Maltese women. Reference is made by
NCPE (2011) to the Labour Force Survey of 2010, where
41% of inactive women in Malta reported that they did not
work due to "other family or personal reasons" while an
insignificant number of men indicated this reason for being
inactive. This scenario clearly questions the relevance of
Anglo-American literature to Maltese workers' work moti-
vation and work ethic. In this section, we overview the major
findings related to work motivation and work hindrances that
emerged from Maltese studies.
The NCPE (2011) also study provides a comprehensive
overview of the Maltese literature on work hindrances and
highlighted multiple disadvantages that Maltese women
face in the Maltese labor market. These include (a) the gen-
der gap in pay, with lower pay rates for women, (b) lower
Bezzina et al. 5
qualification levels of women despite a significant increase
in tertiary education for women in the last decade, (c) lower
percentages of inactive women participating in training and
education when compared with inactive men and corre-
sponding EU27 figures, (d) a downward trend in vulnerable
employment since the economic crisis of 2008, which his-
torically has been dominated by women, (e) lack of aware-
ness of employees rights by employers, and (vi) short school
hours.
NCPE (2011) conducted a descriptive study with inactive
Maltese women and found that 65% of those surveyed
claimed that they would prefer to raise their children them-
selves and to give up paid employment rather than using a
childcare facility. In addition, 40.5% claimed that if they
leave their children for long hours at a childcare facility, they
feel that they are actually abandoning their children and
hence they are not good mothers. In all, 75% of the 61.5%
who plan to seek work were mainly motivated by money,
and 54.5% were interested in part-time work to help them
attend to work and family life. A total of 68% of respondents
were not aware of government incentives aimed at helping
inactive women to work, while many felt that such govern-
ment incentives were offensive as they underestimated their
role as homemakers and mothers. The NCPE (2011) study
with labor inactive women concluded that such incentives
would not work unless there was a change in culture.
Borg and Vella (2007) set out to identify the work aspira-
tions of Maltese working women. They found that employ-
ment helps women to enhance their quality of life and of
their dependents, to gain financial independence, to enhance
skills and personal development, to be productive and to feel
satisfied that they are contributing to society. More recently,
Borg (2011) argued that by working, women become more
independent as they are more able to satisfy their own needs
and to enhance their standard of living, Moreover, work
allows women to gain self-confidence that helps in nurturing
talent and socialization and provides mothers with the oppor-
tunity to inspire their children and to instill in them a positive
attitude toward working from a young age.
Method
The Research Gap in Malta
As mentioned earlier, the specific context of Malta and the
relatively hostile environment for women to work raises
questions on the relevance of the Anglo-American literature
for Malta. Although quite a few studies have been conducted
in Malta on work motivations and hindrances, the majority
of them lack methodological rigor, or else the data analysis
they conducted was quite simplistic as it generally consisted
of a basic descriptive summary with the use of counts, per-
centages, and/or means. In addition, most of the research
conclusions drawn are in the form of suggested explanations
with little empirical basis.
In view of the above, the primary aim of this empirical
study is to gain a better understanding of the work motiva-
tions of Maltese female workers. This study will extend the
Maltese literature on work motivation by examining the
underlying dimensions of work motivation among Maltese
female workers. The study also attempts to identify the work
hindrances faced by working women (as previous Maltese
studies focused exclusively on the unemployed or the inac-
tive) in an attempt to provide useful recommendations that
might better guide Maltese labor market policy makers in
their quest to increase the employment rate of women in
Malta. In this study, any explanations that we provide are
supported by empirical evidence.
The Research Questions
This empirical study attempts to answer the following five
research questions:
·
· Research Question 1: How important are the various
work motivation factors for employed women in
Malta?
·
· Research Question 2: What are the underlying
dimensions (or components) of work motivation of
employed women in Malta?
·
· Research Question 3: Can the work motivation com-
ponents adequately predict the intention of women to
keep on working in the future (at least up to the retire-
ment age), after controlling for the demographic
variables?
·
· Research Question 4: What are the main challenges
that Maltese female workers face to work?
·
· Research Question 5: What should be done by
Maltese policy makers to increase the participation
rate of women in the Maltese labor market?
The study is exploratory in nature and so no hypotheses
have been set.
Population and Sample Characteristics
Table 1 exhibits a breakdown of the female working popula-
tion in Malta by age and occupation, according to the "Labour
Force Survey: Q4/2011" (National Statistics Office, 2012).
The Labour Force Survey was used because the Census of
2005 was relatively outdated and the Census of 2012 had not
yet been published by the National Statistics Office.
The National Statistics Office was not in a position to
provide us with the names and contact details of the
employed women due to the Malta Statistics Authority Act
(Malta Statistics Authority, 2000). Hence, with no sampling
frame available, we had to resort to a nonprobability sam-
pling technique, namely, quota sampling. Quota sampling is
similar to stratified sampling but leaves the choice of the
elements to the discretion of the researcher (Hair, Money,
6 SAGE Open
Samuoel, & Page, 2007). Although the elements are not
selected at random, the representativeness of quota sam-
pling is still reasonable to high (Saunders, Lewis, &
Thornhill, 2012). In determining sample size for this study,
we focused on those variables in the questionnaire that were
likely to have the greatest variability (De Vaus, 2002)--
these being the dichotomous categories (e.g., YES vs. No).
Using the confidence interval of a proportion dialog box in
the "Java Applets for Power and Sample Size" (Lenth,
2012), we specified a population of 58,439 employed
women, a 95% degree of confidence, a 5% margin of error
and a true sample proportion of 50% (assuming a worst-case
scenario for the percentage belonging to a specified cate-
gory). The required minimum sample size with the preset
criteria was 383, and this was rounded up to 400. In select-
ing the 400 participants, we sought help from our network of
friends from the Malta Employers Association and from the
Trade Unions who voluntarily agreed to help us in the
process.
After establishing contact with the participants, the vast
majority (72%) provided us with their e-mail address, and
we forwarded to them a link to our survey on surveymonkey.
com. The other respondents preferred to provide the
responses via a telephone interview (24%) or using tradi-
tional mail (4%). The respondents were informed that there
were no "right" or "wrong" answers to the statements and
that the individual responses would be used by researchers to
see the "big picture." Confidentiality was guaranteed and the
respondents were assured that all information gathered was
to be used solely for research purposes. All data were col-
lected during July 2012. Table 2 exhibits the population and
sample distributions by age and occupation.
The Survey
Before constructing the survey, three focus groups were con-
ducted with 10 active women, 10 inactive women, and 10 rela-
tives living in households with working women. The members
had different ages that ranged from 18 to 64 and occupied
various roles in the labor market. The moderators tried to elicit
the primary motives for working from the group members
without influencing them. The participants declared that they
were more than happy to discuss the topic and to present their
views on the subject. The sessions were transcribed, but we
assured the participants that their names would not be dis-
closed in any way to guarantee confidentiality. From these
focus groups, 16 distinct work motivations emerged: (a) finan-
cial independence, (b) earning money for basic necessities (or
day-to-day needs), (c) meeting people and making new friends
(socialization), (d) keeping busy, (e) for skill/ability utiliza-
tion, (f) to gain a sense of achievement, (g) to feel responsible
for their work, (h) to be recognized for their work, (i) to
enhance their self-esteem, (j) for career advancement, (k) to
supervise or guide others, (l) to climb up the social ladder, (m)
to be creative/innovative, (n) to do something different from
housework (variety), (o) to enjoy a more comfortable lifestyle,
and (p) to escape from personal problems and/or bad habits
(protection). We did not attempt to classify these motivators as
intrinsic or extrinsic due to the general difficulty in identifying
purely intrinsic and extrinsic factors and the nature of the
interaction between extrinsic and intrinsic motivators. Instead,
we subjected the responses pertaining to these 16 statements to
exploratory factor analysis, to identify the underlying latent
structure of work motivation for employed women in Malta.
The survey consisted of three sections. Section A con-
sisted of the 16 statements related to the work motivations
and respondents were requested to indicate their level of
agreement with each statement on a standard five-point
scale ranging from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree"
(e.g., "A job gives me the opportunity to provide for the
day-to-day needs"). Section B consisted of the following
two open-ended responses: (a) What are the main chal-
lenges that you face to work? (b) What strategies would
you like to see implemented by policy makers to increase
the chances that you will keep on working in the future and
also to attract new women to the Maltese labor market?
Finally, in Section C, the respondents were requested to
provide demographic information regarding their age, mar-
ital status (single and never married, married or other),
number of children (as dependents), occupation, level of

education and type of employment (full-time, full-time
with reduced hours, or part-time). They were also requested
to rate their intention to continue to work in the future (at
least up to the retirement age) on a dichotomous scale with
"No" (coded as "0") and "Yes" (coded as "1") categories.
Data Analysis Procedure
For the closed-ended responses of the survey, we started by
determining, via descriptive statistics, how important the 16
proposed reasons to work (which emerged from the focus
groups) were in motivating Maltese women to work. Then,
the responses to 16 work motivation statements were sub-
jected to exploratory Factor Analysis, to investigate the
underlying factor structure of the work motivations of
Maltese female workers. Finally, hierarchical binary logistic
regression was used to investigate which of the work motiva-
tion factors (as suggested by Factor Analysis) emerged as
significant predictors of the intention of Maltese women to
continue to work in the future (at least up to the retirement
age) after controlling for any effects of the demographic
variables (i.e., age, education, number of children, employ-
ment type, and marital status). The above statistical analyses
were conducted in the IBM SPSS V20 package.
For the open-ended responses, a thematic approach was
adopted to analyze the primary data in an attempt to identify
key themes that would prove to be helpful in identifying
strategies for attracting and retaining female workers to the
labor market and in providing some interesting avenues for
further research.
Results
How important are the various work motivation factors
for employed women?
With the scale for each statement ranging from "1" (for
strongly disagree) to "5" (for strongly agree), descriptive sta-
tistics of the responses to the 16 work motivation statements
revealed that the respondents:
1. strongly agree (median = 5) that a job gives them the
chance to pay for basic necessities and to be finan-
cially independent;
2. agree (median = 4) that a job gives them the opportu-
nity to socialize, to utilize their skills/abilities, to gain
a sense of achievement, to be responsible/account-
able for their work, to enjoy a more comfortable life-
style, to keep busy, to enhance their self-esteem, to
advance in their career, to be recognized for their
work, to be creative in their work, and to climb the
social ladder;
3. neither agree nor disagree (median = 3) that work
gives them the opportunity to escape from problems
or bad habits, and to supervise (or guide) other
workers.
A summary of descriptive statistics is presented in Table 3.
What are the underlying dimensions (or components) of
the work motivation of employed women in Malta?
Factor analysis is a method for investigating whether the
information provided by a large number of variables can be
condensed into a smaller set of unobservable factors or com-
ponents (Hair, Anderson, Tatham, & Black, 1998). In pre-
liminary analysis, we examined the statistical assumptions of
Factor Analysis. The Bartlett Test of Sphericity, Approx. 2
(20) = 2151.45, p < .001, revealed that the correlations (when
taken overall) were statistically significant. In addition, the
Kaiser­Meyer­Olkin (KMO = .908) measure of sampling
adequacy was acceptable (Hair et al., 1998). Hence, the
Factor Analysis proceeded.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that there
were two eigenvalues (or s) greater than "1," with Factor 1
( = 6.30) accounting for 39.4% of the variance and Factor
2 (= 1.32) accounting for 8.3% of the variance of work
motivation. After applying Direct Oblimin (an oblique fac-
tor rotation that extracts correlated factors), Factor 1 com-
prised nine work motivation aspects (skill/ability utilization,
sense of achievement, for career advancement, supervision,

creativity, recognition, self-esteem, responsibility, and social
status), while Factor 2 comprised the remaining seven work
motivation aspects (financial independence, socialization,
keeping busy, escape, earning money for basic necessities,
enjoying a more comfortable lifestyle, and variety from
housework). A summary of the Pattern matrix factor load-
ings is presented in Table 4.
Factor 1 was interpreted as Personal and Professional
Development while Factor 2 was interpreted as Social and
Economic Well-being. There was a substantial correlation
between the factors (r = .56). No variable loaded significantly
on more than one factor (i.e.,  .30). Reliability analysis
revealed that the internal consistency reliability of the Factor 1
(Cronbach's  = .89, N = 9) and Factor 2 (Cronbach's  = .71,
N = 7) measures were acceptable as they both exceeded .7
(Hair et al., 1998). Therefore, we concluded that the two work
motivation components that emerged from Factor Analysis
were internally consistent and unidimensional.
Can the work motivation components adequately predict
the intention of women to keep on working in the
future (at least up to the retirement age), after control-
ling for the demographic variables?
Preliminary analysis, via zero-order correlations, revealed
that the intention to continue working in the future was:
a. significantly correlated with "personal and profes-
sional development" (r = .43, p < .01), "social and psy-
chological well-being" (r = .33, p < .01), level of
education (r = .36, p < .01), and number of children as
dependants (r = -.18, p < .01), single but never married
status (r = .12, p = .02), and chronological age (r = .10,
p = .05); and
b. not significantly correlated with the employment cate-
gories--full-time (r = .02, p = .67), full-time with
reduced hours (r = -.01, p = .78), and part-time (r =
-.01, p = .79)--and two of the three civil status catego-
ries--married (r = -.04, p = .49) and "other" (r = -.12,
p = .02), which comprises those who are divorced,
widowed, separated, or had their marriage annulled.
Binary logistic regression is a statistical technique that is
similar in many respects to multiple regression analysis, but
is more appropriate when the criterion variable is qualitative
or binary (Cramer, 2003). In hierarchical binary logistic
regression, it is possible to know what additional proportion
of variance in intention to continue to work is explained by
the two work motivation components after external factors
such as demographic variables are controlled. Intention to
continue working in the future (No = 0, Yes = 1) was included
as the dependent variable, while the two work motivation
components and five demographic variables of age, educa-
tion, number of children as dependants, employment type
(a categorical variable) and marital status (a categorical vari-
able) were included as covariates. Here, the demographic
variables were entered together in the first step, while the
work motivation components were entered together in the
second step.
Prior to the interpretation of hierarchical binary logistic
regression results, a summary of which is presented in
Table 5, a residual analysis was conducted. All DFBETAs
were less than 1, the leverage statistics were close to the

average value (i.e., no. of predictors divided by the sample
size = 3/400 = .0075) and none were greater than three times
this average value, no values of Cook's distance were greater
or equal to 1, and only 4.7% (which does not exceed the
threshold of 5%) of the cases had absolute standardized
residual above 2. Hence, according to the guidelines pro-
vided by Field (2009), there was no evidence of isolated
points that might have fitted the model poorly or exerted an
undue influence on the logistic regression model.
When the constant was entered into the model (Block 0),
the regression weight for the constant in Step 0 was statisti-
cally significant,  = 1.33, SE() = .12, p < .01. The classifi-
cation table indicated that 79% of the cases were correctly
classified and hence, the proportional by chance accuracy
rate is 66.8% (i.e., .792 + .212 = .6682). When the demo-
graphic variables were introduced in Step 1, 2 (7) = 69.65,
p < .01, education,  = 1.07, SE() = .17, p < .01, accounted
for 24.9% of the variability in intention (based on Nagelkerke
R2). The classification table indicated that 81.3% of the cases
were correctly classified at this stage.
When the work motivation components were introduced,
2 (2) = 71.98, p < .01, "Personal and Professional
Development,"  = 1.54, SE() = .36, p < .01, and "Social
and Economic Well-Being,"  = 1.21, SE() = .39, p < .01,
were entered into the model. The work motivation compo-
nents accounted for an additional 21.5%, resulting in a total
Nagelkerke R2 of 46.4%, and an overall holdout accuracy
rate of 86.5%. Therefore, it was concluded that the probabil-
ity of working in the future (at least up to the retirement age)
was associated with (a) a higher level of education,
(b) a greater motivation for Personal and Professional
Development, and (c) a greater motivation for Social and
Economic Well-Being.
The final overall accuracy of classification of the model
(86.5%) exceeded the proportional by chance accuracy
rate (66.82%) by more than 25%, thus confirming the
utility of the logistic regression model (Hosmer &
Lemeshow, 2000).
What are the main challenges that Maltese female work-
ers have to face to work?
The responses to this open-ended question could be
grouped under the following seven headings: (a) not being
accepted to work in male dominated jobs, (b) facing a lot of
resistance from male colleagues at work, (c) difficulty when
compared with their male counterparts to get promoted at the
place of work, and hence a lower salary, (d) difficulty in
finding suitable and affordable childcare facilities for chil-
dren, (e) time management related to work and family
responsibilities, (f) difficulty to find a job with reduced hours
and flexi-time, and (g) husbands or partners who do not give
a helping hand at home and so the work at home has to be
done by the women irrespective of whether they work.
What should be done by Maltese policy makers to increase
the participation rate of women in the Maltese labor
market?
The recommendations provided by the respondents
could be grouped under the following seven headings: (a)
enforce harassment laws at the place of work, (b) increase
opportunities for flexi-time and reduced hours, particularly
for parents with young children, (c) longer school hours,
(d) more affordable childcare centers and close to the place
of work, (e) to continue investing in education, and provide
additional support to women to keep studying beyond a
first degree or a postgraduate diploma, (f) increase tax
incentives for working mothers, and (g) enforce laws to
ensure that no-one abuses of social assistance so that there
will be a better distribution of social assistance to those
who deserve it.

Discussion and Recommendations
This study identifies 16 aspects that motivate employed
women in Malta to work. These are: for financial indepen-
dence; to pay for basic necessities (or day-to-day needs); to
meet people and making new friends (socialization); to keep
busy; for skill/ability utilization; to gain a sense of achieve-
ment; responsibility; recognition; to increase self-esteem; for
career advancement; for supervision; to climb up the social
ladder; to contribute to the economy of the country; to be
creative; variety from housework; to enjoy a more comfort-
able lifestyle; and to escape from personal problems or bad
habits (protection). The study confirms the findings by Borg
and Vella (2007) that employed women are primarily moti-
vated by financial independence, but they are also highly
interested in their career, social status, self-esteem, among
others. This is clearly a sign that we are in the right direction,
particularly in view of the fact that the Maltese context has
been described as a hostile environment for working women
(NCPE, 2011).
The most important contribution of the present study is that
it provides empirical evidence that the 16 work motivations of
Maltese female workers could be grouped into two internally
consistent and unidimensional components, namely, "personal
and professional development" and "social and economic
well-being." This classification was very logical and it solved
the original problem that we had, prior to conducting the factor
analysis, in grouping the 16 motivations into intrinsic or
extrinsic. This mainly resulted from general difficulty in iden-
tifying purely extrinsic and extrinsic factors and due to the
nature of the interaction between the two.
The study also shows that those who have a greater inten-
tion to continue working in the future (at least up to the
retirement age) had a higher level of education and reported
a higher motivation for "Personal and Professional
Development" and for "Social and Economic Well-Being."
Education provides many opportunities to acquire a range of
skills and abilities, and in overcoming the ever-increasing
competition in today's job market. This is because education
pays in higher earnings and lower employment rates (Baum,
Ma, & Payea, 2010; U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics, 2013).
The fact that work motivations produced a significant impact
on the intention to continue working has important implica-
tions for organizations. The work motivations of female
employees may be enhanced at the workplace through orga-
nizational strategies and managerial practices. This would
not only benefit the women in achieving their motivational
goals but also the companies in overcoming the shortages of
skilled labor resulting from ageing populations that are put-
ting an increasing brake on economic growth (European
Commission, 2012b).
Finally, this study identified that the main challenges that
female workers face to participate in the labor market are
mainly related to (a) discriminations at the place of work
(lower pay, fewer promotions gap, and harassment), (b) a
strong culturally constructed ideology in the Maltese islands
(husbands or partners who do not participate in home chores
or disapprove of their wife/partner working), and (c) an inad-
equate support structure (lack of affordable childcare cen-
ters, relatively short school hours, difficulty to find employers
who commit to flexible work arrangements). Based on these
findings, we propose the following recommendations to
labor market policy makers and employees:
1. To increase the supply of childcare centers and with
extended opening hours to accommodate those work-
ing on a shift basis. In addition, it is important that
these childcare centers are located close to the places
of work, particularly in areas where there is a large
concentration of employees.
2. To enact policies to increase childcare availability:
Companies employing a sizable number of employ-
ees should be encouraged to have in-house facilities
for childcare or to make agreements with childcare
centers nearby.
3. To increase school hours to accommodate office
hours: Extra school hours could include extracurricu-
lar activities such as football nurseries and dance les-
sons. Alternatively, students may have the chance to
do their homework at school in the presence of a
qualified learning assistant. However, although Malta
has one of the lowest rates of school hours in the EU,
the Malta Union of Teachers has been against the
extension of school opening hours.
4. Invest further in education and training: There needs
to be increased public awareness of the factors under-
lying low female participation in Malta and the ben-
efits of working legally. The government of Malta
needs to invest further in tailor-made vocational
training and nonformal education for the needs of
women who would like to be productively employed
and to reduce the skills gap. It would also make more
sense if courses targeted for mothers are offered dur-
ing school hours rather than during the evening. In
addition, if we ever want to have more women on
corporate boards of listed companies, as recom-
mended by the European Commission (2012a), edu-
cational policy makers need to provide additional
support to women to help them to keep studying
beyond a first degree or a postgraduate diploma. As
Bezzina (2010) put it, if Maltese society succeeds in
identifying and nurturing talented persons, regardless
of gender, that would help boost our economy.
5. Amendments to Educational Policy: In line with the
NCPE (2011) study, it is clear from the present study
that cultural issues need to change to combat the hos-
tile environment women have to face to work. In this
regard, we recommend amendments in the educa-
tional policy whereby new "learning" is provided
from a young age to change the existing attitudinal
Bezzina et al. 11
environment that distinguishes between the roles
"assigned" to men and women in society. In addition,
the suggestion made by Desai (as cited in Casserly,
2012) is relevant to the Maltese case--to recommend
to mothers to show their children that even they can
earn money and/or have a career (traditionally con-
sidered as pertaining to the male domain), whilst
ensuring that their boys as well as their husbands
share in domestic chores (traditionally considered as
pertaining to the feminine domain).
6. Provide incentives to companies that offer family-
friendly measures such as teleworking and flexible
hours, to help women better reconcile family and
work responsibilities, particularly in view of the fact
that most of the companies in Malta have a negative
attitude toward such measures. Hewlett (2009) pro-
vides evidence that a number of international firms
that committed to flexible work arrangements coped
better with tough times during the economic reces-
sion (via reduced payroll costs) while the employees
who opted for these arrangements had more control
over their destiny, resulting in a win-win situation
for employees and employers.
7. Promoting men in the family sphere: The traditional
gender ideology, with women as caregivers and men
as breadwinners is still strong in Malta (NCPE,
2011). More initiatives similar to the "sharing work­
life responsibilities" program (a social marketing
campaign funded by the EU) are needed to challenge
traditional roles and to promote the benefits of men's
involvement in the family. In addition, policy makers
could consider introducing the father to the picture
when it comes to maternity leave. After all, the father
also bears child-bearing responsibilities and paternity
leave could possibly reduce discrimination against
women in the recruitment stage as such leave is cur-
rently only associated with women.
8. Awareness and practicality of measures. Measures
that are introduced should be heavily communicated
and promoted to ensure that females are aware of
them. At the same time, such measures need to be
practical and do not involve a lot of bureaucracy for
women to benefit from them.
9. Trade-off between welfare and work--increase mini-
mum wage? The respondents reported that the mini-
mum wage is so low that it is not worth working.
However, raising the minimum wage, as some sug-
gested is not as simple as it might seem. This pro-
posal needs to be studied further. An industrial impact
analysis could be conducted to determine whether
firms are in a position to absorb the additional costs,
or whether this would reduce Malta's competitive-
ness resulting in many jobs being lost (Bezzina,
Falzon, & Zammit, 2012). The respondents' concern
on the low pay is not limited to Malta. In a foreign
study, Edin and Lein (1997) found that employed
lone mothers spent substantially more each month to
keep their families together (with childcare, commut-
ing or double tax on earnings) than welfare recipients
did, and "instead of achieving their goals, they were
getting further and further behind in their bills" (p. x).
Our recommendation here is that if we want to see
more women engage in the labor market, we need to
provide women with jobs that act like ladders not
chutes. In addition, prevention of nonobserved eco-
nomic activity should not only increase tax revenue
but also a means to support lawful entrepreneurship
and employment.
10. 10.Fighting Discrimination and Harassment:
Although there are sufficient laws in place to safe-
guard against discrimination and harassment,
enforcement needs to be strengthened. It is the criti-
cal responsibility of the government to promote
adherence to the law by discovering and punishing
persons who violate the established rules.
To stand a better chance of being implemented success-
fully, all the above measures and recommendations need to
be part of a new integrated strategic labor market plan. More
close collaboration between the government and the private
sector is required. Having the government striving to pro-
mote effective policies and the private sector not willing to
collaborate will not yield any benefits.
Conclusion
There are some limitations to the findings, however, that
must be noted. First, this study focused exclusively on female
workers and thus excluded men, an equally important seg-
ment of the labor force. Second, the findings were based on
a quota sample of employed women, and so the sampling
characteristics might not have represented the population
well. Third, the study was based on self-reports. It could be
that some respondents might have encountered difficulty to
answer with objectivity and precision on a five-point Likert-
type scale, or might have given answers that were desired,
and this might have biased in some way or other the findings.
Fourth, to avoid problems associated with a lengthy ques-
tionnaire, we only asked a single question related to each
work motivation aspect, and hence we are not in a position to
test the reliability of the individual work motivation aspects
assessed. We did however test the reliability and validity of
the two work motivation constructs that emerged from this
study. Finally, the study was conducted in the specific social,
cultural, and economic context of Malta. Hence, the find-
ings/implications of this study might not lend themselves to
generalizations over other cultures and societies.
Despite these limitations, this study contributes to a better
understanding and assessment of the work motivations of
Maltese workers, particularly for Malta where such research
12 SAGE Open
is lacking. It addresses 10 practical recommendations that
could better guide Maltese labor market policy makers in
their quest to attract more women to the labor market, whilst
ensuring that those who are currently working continue to
work in the future (at least up to the retirement age).
Following this study, interesting avenues for further
research emerge. Researchers interested in examining fur-
ther the work motivations of women (employed, unem-
ployed, or inactive) might wish to combine an interpretative
approach with a quantitative analysis like this one to tease
out the intricacies of individual and group behaviors and
motivations. This study could be extended by examining
work motivations by occupation, to identify the specific
needs of each distinct occupational group. Finally, there is a
need for research that examines strategies for increasing
women's participation in the labor market so that societies
do not continue to underutilize the many talents and skills
that women bring to the workplace. Such research would
better inform theory and practice.
