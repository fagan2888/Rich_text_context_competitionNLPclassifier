Abstract
Objective: To investigate the effects of Cushing's disease (CD) and adrenal-dependent Cushing's
syndrome (ACS) on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone metabolism.
Methods: Data were retrospectively collected for 55 patients with hypercortisolism (CD, n ¼ 34;
ACS n ¼ 21) from January 1997 to June 2014. BMD was examined in all patients, and bone turnover
markers were tested in some patients. Healthy controls (n¼ 18) were also recruited.
Results: The lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD were significantly lower in the ACS and CD
groups than in the control group. Lumbar BMD was significantly lower in the ACS than CD group.
The collagen breakdown product (CTX) concentrations were significantly higher while the
osteocalcin and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP) concentrations were

significantly lower in the ACS and CD groups than in the control group. The PINP concentration
was significantly lower while the CTX concentration was significantly higher in the ACS than CD
group. In the CD group only, lumbar BMD and serum adrenocorticotropic hormone had a
significant positive correlation.
Conclusions: Bone turnover markers indicated suppressed osteoblast and enhanced osteoclast
activities. PINP and CTX changes might indicate bone mass deterioration. Adrenocorticotropic
hormone might be protective for lumbar BMD in patients with CD.

Introduction
Hypercortisolism is a syndrome character-
ized by chronically high cortisol levels.
It is classified as either adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH)-dependent or ACTH-
independent (i.e., adrenal tumor) based on
the underlying cause. Osteoporosis has been
recognized as a serious consequence of
endogenous hypercortisolism since the first
description by Harvey Cushing in 1932.1
The reported prevalence of osteoporosis
due to excess endogenous cortisol ranges
from 50% to 59%.2,3 Pathological frac-
tures, particularly in the vertebral spine,
can be the presenting manifestation of
hypercortisolism.4,5 The proposed mecha-
nism by which excess glucocorticoid leads
to the development of secondary osteopo-
rosis is multifactorial. Early identification
of the characteristic changes in bone mass
with hypercortisolism assists with early
identification of bone mass loss and timely
treatment, thus reducing the occurrence of
adverse events such as fractures.
The current study was performed
to compare the characteristics of the
bone mineral density (BMD) and bone me-
tabolism in patients with ACTH-dependent
or ACTH-independent hypercortisolism
versus healthy controls and to analyze the
effects of ACTH on BMD in patients with
adrenal-dependent Cushing's syndrome
(ACS) and Cushing's disease (CD).
Materials and methods
Patients
We retrospectively analyzed data for
78 patients with hypercortisolism, including
52 patients with CD and 26 patients with
ACS. All patients had signs and symptoms
of overt hypercortisolism.
Patients were excluded from the study if
they had subclinical Cushing's syndrome,
forms of hypercortisolism other than CD
and ACS (e.g., ectopic ACTH syndrome,
adrenocortical hyperplasia, or adrenocortical
carcinoma), recurring diseases, or comorbid
diabetes mellitus prior to admission. Finally,
55 patients (21 with ACS and 34 with CD)
were included in this study. Data for 18
healthy controls were collected from the
physical examination center of the Tianjin
Medical University General Hospital.
Cushing's syndrome was diagnosed
based on clinical features and the following
endocrine work-up: measurement of serum
cortisol and ACTH at 08:00, 16:00, and
24:00; measurement of 24-h urinary free

cortisol (UFC) excretion, evaluated as the
mean value of three different samples col-
lected on consecutive days; an overnight
low-dose dexamethasone suppression test
(2 mg/d administered orally, with measure-
ment of urine cortisol the following day)
and overnight high-dose dexamethasone
suppression test (8 mg/d administered
orally, with measurement of urine cortisol
the following day); and findings of a space-
occupying lesion on adrenal computed
tomography or pituitary magnetic reso-
nance imaging. All healthy controls were
confirmed healthy based on their clinical
history, physical examination findings, and
routine laboratory test results. The patients
and controls were matched in terms of sex,
age, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, and
geographic origin.
The exclusion criteria for all patients and
healthy controls in this study were pregnan-
cy, alcoholism, smoking, chronic disease,
and previous or current exposure to drugs
affecting the pituitary-adrenal axis or bone
metabolism.
Biochemical evaluation
In all patients and healthy controls, blood
samples were obtained in a fasting state,
and calcium, phosphorus, alanine amino-
transferase, creatinine, total cholesterol,
and triglycerides in the plasma samples
was measured using standard enzymatic
techniques (Hitachi 7600 Automatic
Biochemistry Analyzer; Hitachi, Tokyo,
Japan). Serum thyroid hormones (free triio-
dothyronine, free thyroxine, and thyroid
stimulating hormone), gonadal hormones
(testosterone and estrogen), adrenal cortex
function (serum adrenocorticotropic hor-
mone and cortisol), parathyroid hormone
(PTH), and 24-h excretion of UFC were
measured using chemiluminescent methods
(Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc.,
Erlangen, Germany). The 25(OH)D3
level
in the plasma samples was measured
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (Immunodiagnostic Systems Ltd.,
The Boldons, UK). Serum bone turnover
markers (serum osteocalcin [OC], procolla-
gen type I N-terminal propeptide [PINP],
and serum collagen type I cross-linked
C-telopeptide [CTX]) were measured
using a chemiluminescent method (Roche
Diagnostics Ltd., Mannheim, Germany).
Urinary calcium was measured using a col-
orimetric method (Roche Diagnostics Ltd.).
This study was conducted in accordance
with the principles of good clinical practice
and the Declaration of Helsinki and was
approved by the ethics committee of the
Tianjin Medical University General
Hospital. All participants provided written
informed consent.
Assessment of BMD
Bone densitometry was performed by dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry using a
Prodigy-GE densitometer (GE Healthcare,
Chicago, IL, USA). The coefficient of var-
iation of the BMD measurements in our
laboratory was <0.1%. Data were analyzed
using absolute BMD values (g/cm2).
Statistical analysis
SPSS v19.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY)
was used for data analysis. All data were
tested for a normal distribution. Normally
distributed data are reported as mean
Æ standard deviation. Statistical analyses
were performed using analysis of variance
for multiple-group comparisons among the
ACS, CD, and control (N) groups, and
the Student­Newman­Keuls test was used
for comparisons between two groups. The
chi-square test was used for count data.
Correlations were tested using Pearson's
test. Linear regression analysis was used
for further correlation testing. Binary logis-
tic regression analysis was used to compare
494 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
the correlations of categorical variables.
Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
Results
Patient characteristics
This study included 21 patients with ACS,
34 patients with CD, and 18 healthy con-
trols. Age, BMI, estimated disease dura-
tion, renal function, blood glucose
concentrations, blood lipid concentrations,
and thyroid hormone concentrations were
not significantly different among the ACS,
CD, and N groups (Tables 1 and 2). The
ACS, CD, and N groups contained one,
two, and one postmenopausal women and
two, nine, and five men, respectively. The
numbers of postmenopausal vs. non-
postmenopausal women and men vs.
women were not significantly different
among the three groups as shown by the
chi-square test. The patients with hypercor-
tisolism were divided into two groups
according to their gonadal status (those
with hypogonadism and those with
normal gonads). Sex, BMD, and age were
taken as independent variables. Binary
logistic regression analysis showed that
lumbar BMD and gonad function had no
correlation (b ¼ 7.778).

The serum ACTH concentration, serum
and urinary cortisol concentrations, and

different among the three groups. The
serum ACTH concentration was signifi-
cantly lower in the ACS group than in the
CD and N groups (P < 0.05). The serum
and urinary cortisol concentrations were
significantly higher in the ACS and CD
groups than in the N group (P < 0.05); how-
ever, the 24-h UFC concentration in the
ACS group was significantly higher than
that in the CD group (P < 0.05) (Figure 1,
Table 3).
Comparison of BMD
Lumbar, femoral, and whole-body BMDs
were significantly lower in the CD and
ACS groups than in the N group
(P < 0.05). Lumbar BMD was significantly
lower in the ACS group than in the CD
group (P < 0.05) (Figure 2, Table 3).
Comparison of bone turnover markers
Bone turnover markers were measured for
10 patients in the ACS group, 11 patients in
the CD group, and 9 patients in the N group.
The serum calcium and phosphorus con-
centrations were significantly lower in the
ACS and CD groups than in the N group
(P < 0.05). However, the serum calcium
corrected by serum albumin was not signif-
icantly different among the groups. No sig-
nificant difference was observed in the
serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or uri-
nary calcium concentration between any
of the groups. Additionally, no significant
difference was observed in the serum calci-
um or phosphorus concentration between
the ACS and CD groups (Figure 3, Table
4).
The serum OC and PINP concentrations
in the ACS and CD groups were significant-
ly lower than those in the N group
(P < 0.05). The serum CTX concentrations
in the ACS and CD groups were significant-
ly higher than those in the N group
(P < 0.05). The CTX concentrations were
significantly higher and the PINP concen-
trations were significantly lower in the
ACS group than CD group. No significant
differences were observed in the serum 25
(OH)D3
concentration among the groups.
The serum PTH concentration in the ACS
group was significantly higher than that in
the CD and N groups (P < 0.05).

positive correlation between BMD and the
OC concentration (P < 0.05), and a signifi-
cant negative correlation between BMD
and the CTX concentration (P < 0.05)
(Figure 4). We found no significant correla-
tions between BMD and the following
parameters: the PTH, urinary calcium, 25
(OH)D3
, urinary cortisol, and serum cortisol
concentrations (data not shown). In the CD
group but not in the ACS group, there was a
significant positive correlation between
lumbar BMD and the serum ACTH
concentration (Figure 5). No significant cor-
relations were found for femoral or whole-
body BMD (data not shown). Further linear
regression analysis was performed in the
CD group, in which age, sex, BMI, disease
course, serum ACTH, and serum cortisol
were taken as independent variables.
The results showed that lumbar BMD and
serum ACTH had a linear correlation
(b ¼ 0.524, P = 0.003). However, when

more independent variables were added (e.g.

and serum calcium), the results showed that
serum cortisol was associated with lumbar
BMD (b ¼ À0.723, P = 0.033). The small

statistical power.
Discussion
In the present study, the serum cortisol and
urinary cortisol concentrations were
significantly higher in patients with ACS
and CD than in healthy controls. In the
patients with hypercortisolism, the serum
ACTH concentration was significantly
higher in patients with CD than in those
with ACS, while the urinary cortisol con-
centration was significantly higher in
patients with ACS than in those with CD;
however, the serum cortisol concentration
was similar between the ACS and CD
groups. The urinary cortisol concentration
in the ACS group was significantly higher

than that in the CD group, indicating that
adrenal adenoma has a strong effect.
Despite the different numbers of men
and postmenopausal women among the
three groups, no significant differences
were observed. dos Santos et al.6 showed
that endogenous hypercortisolism was a
more important determinant of bone prop-
erties than was the gonadal status. In the
present study, the patients with hypercortis-
olism were divided into a hypogonadism
group and a normal gonads group, and
the binary logistic regression analysis
showed that lumbar BMD and gonad func-
tion had no correlation. Therefore, we
do not believe that sex hormones were a
confounding factor affecting bone density
in this study.
Osteoporosis is one of the most impor-
tant clinical consequences of hypercortiso-
lism. In the present study, the lumbar,
femoral, and whole-body BMDs were sig-
nificantly lower in patients with ACS and
CD than in the healthy controls, similar
to a previous study.6 The differences in
the location and degree of decreased BMD
showed a trend that followed the underly-
ing cause of hypercortisolism, while a pre-
vious study showed that patients with ACS
had significantly greater loss of bone mass
than did patients with CD.7 Patients with
ACS had poorer BMD in the lumbar
region than did patients with CD in the
present study, while femoral BMD was sim-
ilar between the two groups. The lumbar
vertebrae contain more cancellous bone
(trabecular bone) than do the femurs; there-
fore, the lumbar vertebrae are more vulner-
able to endogenous glucocorticoid
damage.8 This is one possible reason for
the differences among the various regions
of BMD in patients with hypercortisolism,
but further studies on this topic are needed.
There were some differences in the
biochemical markers of bone metabolism
between patients with hypercortisolism
and healthy controls. In the present
study, the serum calcium and phosphorus
concentrations were significantly lower in
the patients with ACS or CD than in the
healthy controls. The serum calcium that
we examined was the total serum calcium,
which comprises both free calcium and
protein-bound calcium, and the level of
protein-bound calcium varies as does the
level of serum albumin. Affected by the
higher levels of cortisol, the serum albumin
concentration in patients with hypercortis-
olism is lower than that in healthy people;
therefore, the serum calcium concentration
corrected by albumin was not significantly
different among the groups in the present
study. In patients with hypercortisolism,
the serum ALP concentration is slightly

higher than that in healthy people; but the
concentration was not significantly different
among the groups in this study. The ALP
that we measured was the total ALP, not
one of the bone isoenzymes of ALP.
The serum PTH concentration was signif-
icantly higher in the patients with ACS or
CD than in the healthy controls; similarly,
higher PTH concentrations were previously
detected in patients with hypercortisolism
than in healthy controls, and the authors
suggested that this reflected active bone re-
sorption and secondary hyperparathyroid-
ism.9 Meng et al.10 showed that urinary
calcium excretion was higher in patients
with hypercortisolism and that hypercalciu-
ria might decrease the serum calcium. Thus,
the parathyroid glands were stimulated and
the PTH secretion increased. Excess PTH
stimulates bone resorption. Rozhinskaia
et al.11 reported that secondary hyperpara-
thyroidism was found in 25% of patients
with hypercortisolism.
Of the bone turnover markers, OC is the
most abundant in the bone matrix and is
produced late in the bone formation pro-
cess. It is synthesized by mature osteoblasts
and then mixed into the bone matrix. Only
a small fraction enters the circulation.
Its function is not clear; it might affect
bone mineralization and play a negative
feedback role during bone remodeling. OC
increases with bone absorption by osteo-
clasts; therefore, the OC concentration
might reflect not only the reactionary state
of bone formation but also the comprehen-
sive state of bone transformation. CTX, a
bone resorption marker, is a product of the
cleavage of type I collagen due to osteoclast
activity. PINP, a bone formation marker, is
a metabolite of the pyrolysis of total type I
tropocollagen (synthesized and secreted by
osteoblasts) under the action of polypepti-
dase. Its serum concentration reflects the
ability of osteoblasts to synthesize collagen.
The serum OC and PINP concentrations in
patients with hypercortisolism are lower
and the CTX concentrations are higher
than those in healthy people, suggesting
that bone formation is suppressed and
bone resorption is increased in hypercortis-
olism. The bone marker concentrations in
the present study suggested significantly
greater suppression of bone formation and
bone resorption in the patients with ACS
than in the patients with CD, which is sup-
ported by the lower lumbar BMD in
patients with ACS than in those with CD.
O'Brien et al.12 suggested that glucocorti-
coids directly or indirectly accelerate
apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes
and reduce osteoclast apoptosis, causing
loss of bone mass. Recent studies have
revealed obviously lower OC concentra-
tions in patients with hypercortisolism
than in healthy people; the concentrations
quickly recovered postoperatively, reaching
peak values at 6 months.13,14
Regarding factors associated with BMD,
there was a significant correlation between
the ACTH concentration and lumbar BMD
in the patients with CD; therefore, ACTH
could potentially have a protective effect on
lumbar BMD. However, the same relation-
ship was not detected for the femoral neck
and whole-body BMDs. ACTH reportedly
stimulates proliferation of osteoblasts and
increases collagen I mRNA in the osteo-
blastic cell line SaOs2 in vitro15,16; ACTH
binds to a specific member of the melano-
cortin receptor family, MC2R, which is
expressed in osteoblastic cells in vivo and
then promotes osteoblast proliferation.
In vitro exposure of bone marrow stromal
cells to ACTH and leptin promotes osteo-
blast differentiation by increased gene
expression of osterix and collagen type I
alpha.17 Furthermore, ACTH might stimu-
late proliferation of osteoblasts in a dose-
dependent manner; i.e., ACTH at 10 nM
stimulates proliferation, while lower
ACTH concentrations might oppose osteo-
blast differentiation.15,16 In the present
study, ACTH was not associated with
Guo et al. 501
lumbar BMD in the patients with ACS, in-
dicating that ACTH might not have a pro-
tective effect on lumbar BMD in patients
with ACS; this finding might have been re-
lated to the low ACTH concentration in
this group. ACTH might have a protective
effect on bone; however, it is not sufficient
to act against the adverse effects of high
cortisol levels on bone metabolism in
patients with CD.
Conclusions
Long-term exposure to excess glucocorti-
coids in patients with hypercortisolism
results in bone loss, with loss of lumbar
bone occurring earlier and more extensive-
ly. To enable early identification and timely
intervention for bone loss, BMD examina-
tions should be prioritized to prevent frac-
tures. At the same time, it is important to
conduct imaging of the vertebrae for early
identification of fractures. Measurement of
bone turnover markers (PTH, OC, CTX,
and PINP) might help with early assessment
of the influence of hypercortisolism on bone
quality. ACTH might have a protective
effect on bone; however, it is not sufficient
to act against the adverse effects of high
cortisol levels on bone metabolism.
Because of the limited sample size and ret-
rospective design in the present study, the
effect of endogenous hypercortisolism on
bone mass should be examined in a larger
prospective cohort of patients.
