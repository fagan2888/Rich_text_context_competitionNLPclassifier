Introduction
Distal thoracic limb surgery in cats, including digit
amputation, biopsy and fracture repair, is performed for
a variety of reasons, for example for treatment of neopla-
sia, infected nail beds and trauma. Onychectomy is prob-
ably the most commonly performed surgery of the distal
thoracic limb in cats.
Scratching is a normal behavior of cats for the pur-
pose of territory marking, stretching forelimbs and con-
ditioning claws.1 However, for many owners, this
behavior is reported to be undesirable owing to the dam-
age inflicted on furniture and belongings.2 Options
available to owners to limit the damage from scratching
cats include non-surgical and surgical methods.3
Onychectomy is becoming increasingly controversial
and has been banned in at least 22 countries and in eight

Abstract
Objectives Though controversial, onychectomy remains a commonly performed distal thoracic limb surgical
procedure in cats. Peripheral nerve block techniques have been proposed in cats undergoing onychectomy but
evidence of efficacy is lacking. Preliminary tests of the described technique using cadavers resulted in incomplete
staining of nerves. The aim of this study was to develop nerve block methods based on cadaveric dissections and
test these methods with cadaveric dye injections.
Methods Ten pairs of feline thoracic limbs (n = 20) were dissected and superficial branches of the radial nerve
(RSbr nn.), median nerve (M n.), dorsal branch of ulnar nerve (UDbr n.), superficial branch of palmar branch of
ulnar nerve (UPbrS n.) and deep branch of palmar branch of ulnar nerve (UPbrDp n.) were identified. Based on
these dissections, a four-point block was developed and tested using dye injections in another six pairs of feline
thoracic limbs (n = 12). Using a 25 G × 5/8 inch needle and 1 ml syringe, 0.07 ml/kg methylene blue was injected
at the site of the RSbr nn., 0.04 ml/kg at the injection site of the UDbr n., 0.08 ml/kg at the injection site of the M n.
and UPbrS n., and 0.01 ml/kg at the injection site of the UPbrDp n. The length and circumference of each nerve that
was stained was measured.
Results Positive staining of all nerves was observed in 12/12 limbs. The lengths stained for RSbr nn., M n., UDbr n.,
UPbrS n. and UPbrDp n. were 34.9 ± 5.3, 26.4 ± 4.8, 29.2 ± 4.0, 39.1 ± 4.3 and 17.5 ± 3.3 mm, respectively. The
nerve circumferences stained were 93.8 ± 15.5, 95.8 ± 9.7, 100 ± 0.0, 100 ± 0.0 and 93.8 ± 15.5%, respectively.
Conclusions and relevance This described four-point injection method may be an effective perioperative analgesia
technique for feline distal thoracic limb procedures.

California cities,4 primarily because it is considered an
unnecessary cosmetic procedure associated with pain
and distress. Another reason for the controversy is a
belief that onychectomized cats are more likely to
develop behavioral problems.2 Regardless, in North
America it is still a commonly performed procedure,2­5
with an estimated 15.5 million cats undergoing onychec-
tomy every year.4 Owner satisfaction with this proce-
dure is reported to be high.3 However, it is generally
agreed that onychectomy is associated with pain.6 Many
cats display overt lameness at the time of discharge from
the hospital,2 and objective gait analysis has shown that
limb function does not return to preoperative values
12 days after onychectomy.6 Furthermore, chronic pain/
neuropathic pain following surgical onychectomy has
been described.2
The best way to avoid pain associated with onychec-
tomy is to not perform the procedure, but when it is per-
formed, it is incumbent on veterinarians to use the most
effective means of providing comprehensive analgesia.
Multiple methods for the alleviation of perioperative
pain associated with this procedure have been described,
including irrigation of surgical incisions with bupiv-
acaine before closure.6,7 Local analgesics are commonly
utilized preoperatively in an attempt to block nocicep-
tive input, avoid central sensitization, reduce the amount
of systemic analgesic required and decrease hospitaliza-
tion time.8­10 In the case of onychectomy and indeed any
other anticipated painful procedure of the distal thoracic
limb, this would involve effective blockade of the nerves
that innervate the manus, including the superficial
branches of the radial nerve (RSbr nn.), the median nerve
(M n.), the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve (UDbr n.),
the superficial branch of the palmar branch of the ulnar
nerve (UPbrS n.) and the deep branch of the palmar
branch of the ulnar nerve (UPbrDp n.). Use of bupiv-
acaine administered as a four-point regional nerve block
prior to onychectomy in cats has been proposed.11
However, in one study, no additional benefit from this
block over systemic buprenorphine administration was
found in cats undergoing forelimb onychectomy.7
The most commonly used technique for local anes-
thetic block in cats undergoing onychectomy appears to
stem from a single case report.11 Preliminary data that
we obtained from critically testing this technique using
cadaver limbs and injections of dye indicated frequent
incomplete staining of targeted nerves (see
supplementary material). Given that a successfully per-
formed nerve block is one of the most effective means to
manage pain,12 we re-evaluated the injection techniques.
The aims of this study were to review the anatomical
location of the RSbr nn., M n., UDbr n., UPbrS n. and
UPbrDp n. in relation to palpable anatomical landmarks
and identify clearly defined injection sites that may pro-
vide a comprehensive blockade of the distal thoracic
limb. An additional aim of this study was to test the
defined sites using volumetrically relevant injections of
dye in cadaver limbs. Our ultimate goal was to establish
a peripheral nerve block technique that may provide
effective analgesia for cats undergoing distal thoracic
limb surgery.
Material and methods
Cadaver dissections
Ten pairs of cadaveric thoracic limbs were obtained from
domestic shorthair cats (nine castrated males and one
spayed female) that had been euthanized with an intrave-
nous overdose of pentobarbital (Fatal Plus solution;
Vortech Pharmaceuticals) for reasons unrelated to this
study. Mean ± SD body weight was 4.0 ± 0.9 kg. The
limbs were disarticulated at their muscular attachment to
the thoracic wall and stored immediately at -18 °C, then
thawed at room temperature overnight prior to use.
Anatomic dissection of the RSbr nn., M n., UDbr n., UPbrS
n. and UPbrDp n. from the level of the mid-antebrachium
distally was conducted to determine palpable landmarks,
anatomic variations, fascial planes and associated struc-
tures. During dissection, potential injection points and
landmarks that would guide injection were recorded.
The accessory carpal bone (ACb) was established as a
reference landmark because it is relatively fixed, and an
easily palpable landmark in the live animal. The location of
each putative injection point was recorded using measure-
ments taken relative to the ACb in the transverse and sagit-
tal planes by the same person (ME) (see `Measurements'
and Figure 1), and simultaneously the descriptive relation-
ship to anatomical landmarks was recorded. Based on
these findings, a subcutaneous, perineural injection tech-
nique using four injection sites was developed for the RSbr
nn., M n., UDbr n., UPbrS n. and UPbrDp n.
Dye studies
Based on the results of the cadaver dissection study, a peri-
neural four-point injection technique was used for `block-
ade' of the RSbr nn., M n., UDbr n., UPbrS n. and UPbrDp
n. Twelve additional thoracic limbs from six cats (three
intact male and three intact females) that were euthanized
for reasons unrelated to this study were used. Mean ± SD
body weight was 4.0 ± 0.9 kg, and individual body
weights were used to calculate the volume for a 0.5% bupi-
vacaine dose of 1 mg/kg per limb. Using a 25 G × 5/8 inch
needle and a 1 ml syringe, an equivalent volume
(0.2 ml/kg per limb) of new methylene blue (NMB [New
Methylene Blue Stain; Jorgensen Laboratories])
distributed as 0.07 ml/kg was administered at the injec-
tion site for RSbr nn., 0.04 ml/kg for UDbr n., 0.08 ml/kg
for M n. and UPbrS n., and 0.01 ml/kg for UPbrDP n.
Approximately 10 mins after the injections, dissection was
performed to expose each nerve. The length and circum-
ference of the stained portion of nerves were measured as
840 Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery 18(10)
previously described.13 The proximity of dye to unstained
or poorly stained nerves was noted.
Measurements
All measurements were made using Dial Calipers (Dial
caliper 505-633-50; Mitutoyo). To minimize error by
limb positioning, all measurements were made with the
carpus extended to 180º and the elbow at an angle of
approximately 45º. The measurements made are detailed
in Figure 1. The confluence point of the cephalic vein
and accessory cephalic vein was established as the tar-
get injection point of the RSbr nn. in order to block these

inserted SC until the point is located two-thirds of the distance from the lateral aspect of the limb to the medial aspect. Two-thirds of the injectate volume is deposited at this point
and the remaining volume is injected while the needle is withdrawn (0.08 ml/kg total). Gentle massage is applied to the injected volume under the skin for 5 s. Deep branch of

penetrates the flexor retinaculum. At this point the injection is performed (0.01 ml/kg of injectate). Red dots indicate the site of needle insertion. The blue arrows represent the

nerves before they branched distally into the digits. The
distance from the lateral aspect of the limb to the RSbr
nn. (A), the width of the limb at the level of the injection
point of the RSbr nn. (B) and the distance proximally
from the ACb to the RSbr nn. (C) were measured. The
distance from the ACb to the lateral epicondyle of the
humerus (D) was also measured. The ratios of A/B (E)
and C/D (F) were calculated. The optimal injection
point for the UDbr n. was determined to be at the level
of the ACb, on the lateral aspect, because at this point
the nerve is not covered with fascia. The distance from
the ACb to the UDbr n. (dorsal view) (G) and the width
of the carpus at the level of the ACb (palmar view) (H)
were measured. The ratio of G/H (I) was calculated.
The area distal to the flexor retinaculum where the M n.
and UPbrS n. descend, parallel to each other, was deter-
mined to be an optimal injection point. The distance
from the lateral aspect of the limb to the M n. (J), the
width of the limb at the level of the injection point of the
M n. and UPbrS n. (K), and the proximodistal distance
from the ACb to the level of the M n. and UPbrS n. (L)
were measured. The ratio of J/K (M) was calculated.
The distance from the lateral aspect of the limb to the
UPbrS n. (N) was measured and J-N (O) and the ratio of
N/K (P) were calculated. The distance from the ACb to
the point where the UPbrDp n. turns deeply was meas-
ured (Q). For all measurements, the measurement point
on the ACb was defined as the center of the attachment
of the flexor carpi ulnaris, humeral head. Measurements
of nerve location were made using the center of the
nerve.
Injection technique
Each limb was shaved on the dorsal aspect from the distal
third of the antebrachium to just distal to the carpus; on the
lateral aspect at the level of the ACb; and on the palmar
aspect between the metacarpal pad and the carpal pad.
The blocks were performed as described below and the
technique is described and illustrated in Figure 2(a­c).
RSbr nn. The limb was positioned with the dorsal aspect
facing upwards and the carpus in 180º of extension. A
point on the cranial antebrachium was identified that
was about 80% of the distance from lateral to medial
and about 18 mm proximal to the level of the ACb
(approximately the point of confluence of the accessory
cephalic and cephalic veins). A 25 G × 5/8 inch needle
was inserted subcutaneously (SC) from a point at the
center of the limb at the level of the antebrachiocarpal
joint. The needle was advanced approximately 10 mm
SC at a 10°­20°angle to the long axis of the limb with the
bevel facing up. Once the tip of the needle was 3­5 mm
from the confluence point of the accessory cephalic and
cephalic veins, 0.07 ml/kg NMB was injected.
UDbr n. The limb was positioned with the lateral aspect
facing upwards. A point was located lateral to and at
the same level as the ACb, positioned between the ACb
and the styloid process of the ulna. A 25 G × 5/8 inch
needle was inserted SC from distal to proximal so that
the tip lay at the midpoint of the groove formed
between the ACb and the styloid process of the ulna,
and then injection of 0.04 ml/kg NMB was
performed.
M n.and UPbrS n. The limb was positioned with the pal-
mar aspect facing upwards. A point was identified
11 mm distal to the ACb, approximately level with the
distal extent of the carpal pad. A 25 G × 5/8 inch needle
was inserted SC at the distal border of the carpal pad and
approximately 5 mm lateral to it, perpendicular to the
long axis of the metacarpus, with the bevel facing up.
The needle was inserted SC until the tip was located
two-thirds of the distance from the lateral aspect of the
limb to the medial aspect. Two-thirds of the injectate vol-
ume was deposited at this point and the remaining vol-
ume was injected while the needle was being withdrawn.
A total volume of 0.08 ml/kg was deposited. Gentle
massage was applied to the injected volume under the
skin for 5 s.
UPbrDp n.The limb was positioned with the palmar
aspect facing upwards. A 25 G × 5/8 inch needle was
inserted with the bevel facing up, almost perpendicular
to the ACb in a mediolateral direction such that the nee-
dle contacted the medial palmar aspect of the midpoint
of the ACb. The needle was then redirected dorsally and
advanced on the medial side of the ACb 2­3 mm until it
penetrated the flexor retinaculum. At this point 0.01 ml/
kg NMB was injected.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using JMP software
(JMP Pro 11; SAS). Wilcoxon's signed rank tests were
used to evaluate pairwise difference in measurements A
through Q between left and right limbs and to compare
body weights between cadaver dissection and dye injec-
tion parts of the study. Correlations between body
weight and measurements A through Q were deter-
mined using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
Differences were considered significant at P <0.05.
Results
Cadaver dissections
There were no significant differences between right limb
and left limb for any measurements (A­Q). The mean,
SD, median, minimum and maximum of the measured
and calculated parameters for the 20 limbs are shown in
Table 1. The correlation coefficient of the measured or
Enomoto et al 843
calculated parameter with body weight is given for each
parameter. There were significant positive correlations
between body weights and A, B, C, D, H, I, K, L, M and
Q. There was no significant relationship between body
weight and the measurements E, F, G, J, N, O and P.
Dye test
There was no significant difference in body weight
between cats in the dissection study and cats in the dye
study. All the cats were of an unknown immature or
early mature adult age.
Positive dye staining of all nerves was observed in
12/12 limbs (Table 2). When targeting the RSbr nn., the
dye was deposited too laterally in 1/12 limbs, resulting
in patchy staining of the nerve. When targeting the
UDbr n., the dye was located in the groove between the
styloid process of the ulna and the ACb, and stained the
nerve well in all cases. For the M n. and UPbrS n., the
dye appeared to spread under the superficial digital
flexor tendon in 2/12 limbs owing to the injection being
made too deeply. This resulted in the injection being
deposited dorsal to the M n. in one case, and therefore
only the dorsal aspects of that nerve were stained well.
The nerves were stained well in the other case. The
injection was deposited intramuscularly (into the
medial edge of the ulnar head of the deep digital flexor
immediately proximal to the continuing deep digital
flexor tendon) when targeting the UPbrDp n. in 1/12
limbs owing to the injection being made too medially,
and not directly adjacent the ACb. This resulted in
patchy staining of the nerve in this case. The dye stained
the nerve well in the other case. Overall, it was deter-
mined that all nerves targeted were stained well and
consistently with this developed four-point injection
method (Figure 2).
Discussion
Preoperatively administered local anesthetics affect
postoperative pain relief by blocking the transmission
of nociceptive signals, thereby intercepting the nocice-
ptive message.14 This should help avoid cellular wind
up and subsequent central sensitization that appears to
contribute to postoperative pain in clinical cases.15 A
local nerve block together with systemic analgesia is
recommended for cats undergoing onychectomy.16
However, neither the described techniques of nerve
blockade nor irrigation of the wound with bupivacaine
before skin closure have been shown to be associated

with beneficial analgesic effects, using subjective or
objective outcome measures.6,7 In our preliminary test-
ing, NMB dye injection using the currently described
four-point block technique resulted in incomplete
nerve staining.11 The currently accepted injection tech-
nique has not been described in depth,11 and this lack
of a detailed description might be partially responsible
for the inaccuracy of the injections performed. The
most obvious deficit of the original technique is that
the injectate is likely to be deposited more medially
than the optimal injection point when targeting the M
n., and this could result in intramuscular injection and
poor blockade of the M n. In this report, we describe in
detail both the anatomical location of nerves in relation
to palpable landmarks and a proposed nerve block
technique. In our dye injection study using our pro-
posed injection technique, all branches of nerves
responsible for innervating the feline thoracic limb
digits were successfully stained with NMB. This
detailed description and associated diagrams, we
believe, will allow veterinarians to perform a more
successful nerve blockade. However, whether this
described technique results in a more successful nerve
blockade needs to be clinically tested. We included cal-
culations of ratios when developing the technique,
assuming that the ratios we calculated would not be
affected by body weight. However, several were, and
so the described technique uses descriptions based on
anatomical landmarks instead of calculated ratios. A
shortcoming of this study was the lack of knowledge of
the specific age of the feline cadavers. However, we
know the cadavers were young animals that had
almost completed their maturity or were young adults
and it is most typical for onychectomy to be performed
in young cats.17 We therefore believe our results are
generalizable to the target population of cats undergo-
ing declawing procedures. Furthermore, we also
believe this nerve block technique is potentially useful
for cats undergoing other distal thoracic limb surgeries
such as complete digit amputation, biopsy and fracture
repair.
Bupivacaine is known to cause cardiac and neurological
side effects, and doses of bupivacaine recommended for
perineural administration in dogs and cats are 1­2 mg/kg.18
Bupivacaine should not be administered intravascularly to
cats.18 Although we did not detect any vascular trauma or
intravascularinjection,precautionsshouldbetakentoavoid
this, including syringe aspiration to confirm an absence of
intravascular needle position before injection is performed.
From our observations during dissections, we believe that
the highest risk for intravascular injection is into the median
artery, which courses in association with the M n. When tar-
geting the M n., keeping the needle as superficial as possible
may help to avoid the median artery, because the vessel lies
deep to the nerve. Our observations suggest that keeping
the injection superficial will also minimize the chance of a
poor block of the M n.
Limitations of this study include the use of cadavers
and the use of NMB dye for injections. Because of the
possible uptake of the local anesthetic solution by the
lymph and blood vessels the distribution of injectate in a
clinical patient may be different than that in cadavers.19
We used NMB as a substitute for local anesthetic solu-
tion, but NMB distribution might not reflect the action of
local anesthetics in vivo, where the action on the nerve
fiber depends on several factors, including drug lipid
solubility, tissue pH and molecular weight.20
Additionally, although we estimated the circumference
of the nerve that was stained, this is not easily assessed
accurately, as previously reported.13

Conclusions
All branches of nerves responsible for innervation of the
feline thoracic limb digits were successfully stained with
NMB using the described four-point injection technique.
To assess the utility and effectiveness of this distal limb
nerve block injection technique it should be evaluated in
clinical patients.

manuscript. The authors of this report do not support feline
onychectomy; however, we do believe cats undergoing this
procedure should be provided effective pain relief of an appro-
priate duration.
Conflicts of interest The authors do not have any potential
conflicts of interest to declare.
