Abstract: Many studies on Hamilton's (1964) inclusive fitness theory have used the
burning house and kidney donation examples of life-threatening altruism. However, these
examples may not be sufficiently exhibiting the risk involved with life-threatening altruism
that would have occurred in hunter-gatherer societies, such as fighting off attackers and/or
predators. The present study examined participants' estimated likelihood to perform
altruistic acts for specific kin members/friends in two violent life-threatening situations
(i.e., being mugged and being chased) and two non-violent life-threatening situations (i.e.,
the burning house and kidney donation examples). Participants were 216 undergraduate
students who completed a questionnaire on altruism toward an actual kin member/friend.
Each questionnaire contained four life-or-death scenarios (two violent and two non-violent)
in which either the participant's sibling, cousin, or best friend was in danger and needed
help. Results indicated that people were more likely to help siblings than cousins and
friends in both the violent and non-violent hypothetical scenarios. Participants indicated a
greater likelihood to help people in violent situations than in non-violent situations. Women
indicated a greater estimated likelihood than men to help people in non-violent situations
while men indicated a greater estimated likelihood than women to help people in violent
situations. Both male and female participants indicated a greater estimated likelihood to
help women than men in violent situations.

Introduction
Hamilton's (1964) inclusive fitness theory has argued that creatures possess a gene
which is responsible for altruistic behavior. This behavior preserves the gene in other
individuals when aid is extended to kin members ­ the individuals who are most likely to
carry a copy of the same altruism gene. This is represented by Hamilton's rule (c < br),
which indicates that an altruist will perform an altruistic act when the biological cost (c) is
Violent versus non-violent altruism
less than the product of the reproductive benefits (b) and the genetic relatedness (r) shared
between the altruist and recipient. From Hamilton's rule, researchers have found that
people are more likely to risk their lives to aid close kin over both distant kin and non-kin
in life-threatening scenarios (Burnstein, Crandall, and Kitayama, 1994; Fitzgerald and
Colarelli, 2009; Kruger, 2001; Stewart-Williams, 2007, 2008), and people are also more
likely to aid healthy kin over those with a disorder that inhibits reproduction of the altruism
gene (Burnstein et al., 1994; Essock-Vitale and McGuire, 1985; Fitzgerald and Colarelli,
2009).
However, it seems like most, if not all, altruism research has used two specific
examples when studying life-threatening altruism. These two examples are 1) the burning
house ­ in which a participant is told to imagine that one or more kin members are trapped
in a burning house and they need the participant to rescue them (Burnstein et al., 1994;
Fitzgerald and Colarelli, 2009; Stewart-Williams, 2007, 2008), and 2) kidney donation ­
where a participant is told to imagine a kin member needs the participant to donate a kidney
in order for that kin member to survive (Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides, 2007; Stewart-
Williams, 2007, 2008). Both of these examples adequately portray the deadly risk involved
in this type of altruism, but they may not be the most fitting examples of life-threatening
situations. For instance, other altruism research has found that other animals (including
non-human primates) take part in life-threatening altruistic acts to help their kin as well
(Kaplan, 2005; Moehlman, 1979), which indicates that altruistic behavior may stem from a
distant common ancestry and has therefore been surviving since before the development of
organ donation and houses.
Although organ donation is a very new concept in human history and therefore is
very unlikely to be an accurate representation of life-threatening altruism in hunter-gatherer
societies, humans have been controlling fire and living in house-like residences for
thousands of years. Therefore, it is possible that burning houses may have been occurring
long enough in human history to shape altruistic behavior ­ allowing for generations of
experience with life-threatening situations in which a kin member must be saved from a
burning residence. However, life-threatening altruism in non-human primates and other
animals indicate that fighting off predators and attackers should be examined to obtain
potentially more accurate representations of life-threatening altruism.
Thus, although the burning house and kidney donation examples adequately display
the life-or-death risk of the specific altruistic act involved, the acts themselves (especially
the kidney donation example) may not be sufficiently exhibiting the risk associated with
life-threatening altruism that would have occurred in early hominid environments (e.g.,
Australopithecus) or in non-human primate societies (e.g., chimpanzees), such as fighting
off attackers and/or predators (Chagnon, 1988; Kaplan, 2005). Therefore, the current study
focused on violent types of life-threatening altruism in which a person's kin member is
being attacked by an aggressor, and the responses to these altruistic acts will be compared
to the standard non-violent altruism scenarios (i.e., burning house and kidney donation
examples).
Sex Differences (or lack thereof) and Altruism
Studies on non-violent altruism have found there to be no sex differences when it
comes to performing these life-threatening acts (Burnstein et al., 1994; Fitzgerald and
Colarelli, 2009; Kruger, 2001; Stewart-Williams, 2007, 2008). Men and women are both

Violent versus non-violent altruism
equally likely to sacrifice their own lives to save a close kin member (Mills, Pedersen, and
Grusec, 1989). However, due to the non-violent nature of the altruistic acts that are
generally used, this finding may be incomplete.
Evolutionary theory and research have argued that males are more physically
aggressive than females (Buss and Duntley, 2006; Daly and Wilson, 1988). This physical
aggression in males may have evolved (among other reasons) from intrasexual competition
(Buss and Duntley, 2006). Males compete with each other for the most attractive and/or
desired mates (Buss, 1988; Darwin, 1871), so this competition has led to aggression. In
fact, males are responsible for 99% of all same-sex murders worldwide (Daly and Wilson,
1988) ­ supporting the theory that physical aggression in males stems from intrasexual
conflict. Conversely, females often resort to verbal aggression during instances of
intrasexual competition (Buss and Dedden, 1990); therefore physical aggression has not
developed in females to the extent that it has developed in males.
There is a plethora of data that support the theory of intrasexual competition and
male aggression, but it is also possible that this intrasexual conflict has grown to inter-
group conflict over the years. This would have led male aggression to develop as a means
of protecting oneself, one's kin members, social status, reproductive status, and resources
from attackers (Buss and Duntley, 2006). Intergroup conflict has led to warfare, pillaging,
abduction and subsequent rape of females between opposing groups (Chagnon, 1988;
Wrangham, 1999). If defensive physical aggression would not have developed, groups
would have suffered severe injury, death, and loss of females ­ all of which would decrease
and/or inhibit reproduction. Thus, it is possible that males may be more physically
aggressive than females when it comes to defending themselves and/or kin members. If
males and females are forced into a situation in which they have to perform a violent act to
save a kin member (e.g., physically fighting off an armed attacker), the results may show a
sex difference ­ something that has not been found in any previous altruism research.
Male altruists may be more likely to physically assault an attacker to save a kin
member than female altruists. Of course, one possible exception to this theory centers on
the mother-child kin relation. Because mothers invest a great deal of time and resources
during gestation, and have complete maternal certainty, they are much more likely than
fathers to tend to the needs of their offspring, which includes protecting them from
predators, sharing precious resources (e.g., food, water, and shelter), and general interest in
the offspring during development (Babchuck, Hames, and Thompson, 1985; Taylor et al.,
2000). Also, multitudes of studies have found that paternity uncertainty decreases the
likelihood of altruism and investment in many types of family members, including parents,
cousins, aunts and uncles, and grandparents (Bishop, Meyer, Schmidt, and Gray, 2009;
Daly and Wilson, 1980; Gaulin, McBurney, and Brakeman-Wartell, 1997; Euler and
Weitzel, 1996; Jeon and Buss, 2007); so it would not be surprising to find that females
would be more likely than males to be violently altruistic to save their offspring. However,
the current study examined the influence that violence may have on altruism toward
siblings, cousins, and friends ­ siblings and friends are unaffected by the paternity
uncertainty principle, and previous research on altruism toward cousins did not find any sex
differences (Jeon and Buss, 2007).

Violent versus non-violent altruism
Materials and Methods
Participants and Design
Participants consisted of 216 undergraduate students (108 males and 108 females)
from Central Michigan University ­ a Midwestern-American university with an on-campus
student population of about 20,000. The average age of the sample was 20.7 years (SD =
4.3). Participants were given extra credit in one of their psychology courses for their
participation.
The study design consisted of a 3 (genetic relatedness between participant and
recipient) x 2 (types of altruism: violent vs. non-violent) x 2 (sex of target) x 2 (sex of
participant) mixed design. Genetic relatedness, sex of the participant, and sex of the target
were between-subject variables whereas type of altruism was a within-subject variable. The
dependent variable was the estimated likelihood of performing the altruistic act.
Stimulus Materials and Measures
A questionnaire containing four fictional scenarios in randomized order was used.
Each questionnaire pertained to one specific target person that was related to the participant
in some way. The target was described as being either the participant's sibling (r = .50),
cousin (r = .125), or best friend (r = 0). Each scenario depicted a situation in which the
target person was in serious peril and would die if the participant did not act to save them.
Two different examples were used for each type of altruism (creating a total of four
altruism scenarios). Non-violent altruism consisted of the burning house example and the
kidney donation example. Both examples yielded a reasonable level of internal consistency
( = .70) and were therefore aggregated to create the non-violent altruism variable. Violent
altruism consisted of an example depicting the target person being mugged and another
example depicting the target person being chased by an attacker. Both examples yielded a
high level of internal consistency ( = .85) and were therefore aggregated to form the
violent altruism variable. Within each scenario was a statement indicating to the
participants that there is a great chance of dying if they choose to help the person in peril.
After each scenario, there was a question asking "What is the likelihood of you helping this
person?" Responses were recorded by circling a number on a 5-point Likert-type scale in
which 1 = "definitely not helping," 2 = "probably not helping," 3 = "maybe helping," 4 =
"probably helping," and 5 = "definitely helping."
Procedure
Participants were given two copies of a consent form. They read and signed both
consent forms, returned one to the experimenter, and kept the second for their own records.
After the consent form, they were given a condition assignment form that consisted of six
questions. Each question asked the participants if they had one of the following six kin
members/friends ­ brother, sister, male cousin, female cousin, male best friend, female best
friend. The participants were randomly assigned to a single condition based on the kin
members/friends they indicated they had. For example, if a participant indicated they had a
brother, sister, and a male best friend, then he/she was randomly assigned to only one of
those conditions ­ either the brother, sister, or male best friend group. Each participant was
only allowed to participate in one condition.
After being assigned to a condition, the participants were given the paper and pencil

Violent versus non-violent altruism
altruism questionnaire and asked to think of the specific person to which they were
assigned (e.g., their brother, sister, etc.). They were then asked to read the questionnaire
and circle a number on the 5-point Likert-type scale below each of the four scenarios. After
everyone had finished, the researcher collected the questionnaires and dismissed the
participants.
Results
A 3 (genetic relatedness) x 2 (type of altruism) x 2 (sex of target) x 2 (sex of
participant) mixed-design ANOVA was performed on the participants' altruism ratings.
The results revealed a significant main effect of genetic relatedness, F(2, 204) = 22.03, p <
.001, p² = .18. A Tukey post-hoc analysis found that people considering their siblings had
a higher estimated likelihood of helping than people considering cousins and friends, but
there was no significant difference in altruism ratings between people considering their
cousins and people considering their friends. Genetic relatedness did not interact with any
variables. See Figure 1 for the mean altruism ratings based on genetic relatedness.

A significant main effect for type of altruism was also found, F(1, 204) = 16.17, p <
.001, p² = .07, indicating people had a higher estimated likelihood of helping those in
violent altruistic situations than non-violent ones. However, this main effect was qualified
by a significant two-way interaction with the sex of the target, F(1, 204) = 13.59, p < .001,
p² = .06. Follow-up analysis found that people were just as willing to help male and
female targets in non-violent situations (p = .51), but they were more willing to help female
targets than male targets in violent situations, F(1, 204) = 8.97, p = .003, p² = .04. Sex of
target did not elicit a main effect nor did it interact with any other variables. See Figure 2

Type of altruism also interacted with the sex of the participant, F(1, 204) = 18.32, p

willing than men to aid people in non-violent situations, F(1, 204) = 4.52, p = .035, p² =
.02, but men were more willing than women to aid people in the violent situations, F(1,

Discussion
The purpose of this study was to examine any possible differences between the non-
violent (i.e., the burning house and kidney donation examples) and violent (i.e., fighting off
an attacker) examples of life-threatening altruism among kin and non-kin. The estimated
likelihood to help siblings more than cousins and friends in these life-threatening scenarios
supports multitudes of previous altruism studies (Burnstein et al., 1994; Fitzgerald and
Colarelli, 2009; Neyer and Lang, 2003; Stewart-Williams, 2007). Similarly, because the
difference in the degree of genetic relation between distant kin and non-kin (in this case,
cousins and friends) appear smaller than the difference in genetic relation between close
kin and distant kin and/or non-kin (Burnstein et al., 1994; Neyer and Lang, 2003), it was
not surprising to find that participants' estimated likelihood to help cousins and best friends
were similar in these life-threatening situations ­ especially since emotional closeness
between altruists and their friends have been shown to increase the likelihood of altruism
(Korchmaros and Kenny, 2001, 2006; Kruger, 2003; Stewart-Williams, 2008).
Although the violent altruism examples yielded higher altruism ratings than the
non-violent examples, the results show that people react pretty similarly when presented
with both types of situations. For instance, the lack of interaction between genetic
relatedness and type of altruism showed that people are just as willing to help a specific
person in a non-violent life-threatening situation and in a violent life-threatening situation.
In other words, a person is equally likely to give his or her sibling a kidney and save that
sibling from an attacker. As is consistent with Hamilton's rule (c < br), the biological costs
of the non-violent and violent altruistic acts are quite similar (at least they were in the
descriptions that were given to the participants in this study), so it is not surprising to see

Violent versus non-violent altruism
that people are just as likely to help a sibling in non-violent and violent situations.
The increased estimated likelihood to help females in violent situations supported
previous evolutionary theory (Chagnon, 1988). This result may reflect an evolved
mechanism that developed as a means of protecting the females of a tribe during times of
war and pillage between groups, when women would be taken by out-group members
(Chagnon, 1988). This would explain why people were just as likely to help men and
women in the non-violent situations ­ male and female kin are equally likely to possess the
altruism gene (provided their genetic relation to the altruist is the same), but female kin
were more likely to be kidnapped by invading tribes and male kin stood a stronger chance
of fighting off these invaders.
The increased altruism ratings from male participants in violent situations also
supported previous evolutionary theory and research on sex differences and aggression
(Buss and Duntley, 2005; Daly and Wilson, 1988). These results do not support any claim
that men are `better altruists' than women; it merely reflects the violent tendencies that
seem to be more prevalent in men than women.
However, the significantly higher altruism ratings from female participants in non-
violent situations were interesting because they do not support any previous altruism
research. Usually, a sex difference is not found when the non-violent altruism examples are
used (Burnstein et al., 1994; Fitzgerald and Colarelli, 2009; Kruger, 2001; Stewart-
Williams, 2007, 2008). It may be that female participants in the present study were aware
of their decreased willingness to help kin and friends in violent situations and therefore
compensated by circling greater altruism ratings for the non-violent situations. This seems
unlikely, but it could be possible since all participants were presented with all altruism
examples. Therefore this may represent a limitation of this study and perhaps future
research could use altruism type as a between-subject variable to examine if this is the
reason for the significant effect.
Conclusion
Although Hamilton's (1964) inclusive fitness theory has been supported time and
time again, the present study helped to shed light on this theory as well as the studies that
have supported it. Although previous studies have generally found no sex differences in
altruism, the current study shows that there are certain facets of altruism that have not yet
been studied ­ such as violent altruistic situations ­ which have left an incomplete picture
of inclusive fitness theory. In addition, the present study used altruistic examples that may
be more evolutionarily significant (e.g., fighting off an attacker) than the traditional
examples that have been used, but still found a similar relationship between the examples
and the likelihood of altruism, which indicated that the traditional examples, although they
may not reflect one's evolutionary past, are valid examples to use in altruism research.
However, the violent altruism situations used in this study are just a couple examples of
how different details in the altruistic situations used in altruism research can influence
participants' responses. Future research may be necessary to examine other possible types
of altruistic examples that incorporate other events from our hunter-gatherer past, such as
evading predators or hunting for survival in the wilderness.
