Although excessive exercise has been studied by many
investigators over the past two decades, consensus on its
definition, diagnostic criteria, or etiology has not been
reached (Johnston, Reilly, & Kremer, 2011). Researchers
agree that excessive exercise encompasses both quantitative
and qualitative aspects. In fact, a number of assessment tools
such as the Obligatory Exercise Questionnaire (OEQ;
Thompson & Pasman, 1991) and the Compulsive Exercise
Test (CET; Taranis, Touyz, & Meyer, 2011) acknowledge
the multidimensional nature of excessive exercise with ques-
tions targeting both its quantitative and emotional aspects.
While there may be an emerging consensus on the multi-
dimensionality of excessive exercise, there have been several
different definitions and labels assigned to this construct.
Excessive exercise has been described as obligatory exercise
(Pasman & Thompson, 1988), compulsive exercise (Yates,
1991), exercise dependence (Ogden, Veale, & Summers,
1997), exercise addiction (Terry, Szabo, & Griffiths, 2004),
and dysfunctional exercise (Calogero & Pedrotty-Stump,
2010). Since a universal definition and underlying cause
have not yet been determined, the more general term exces-
sive exercise will be used in this article whenever possible.
The multidimensionality of excessive exercise has been
reaffirmed in numerous studies (Hausenblas & Downs, 2002;
Meyer, Taranis, Goodwin, & Haycraft, 2011). In their review,
Hausenblas and Downs (2002) suggested that excessive
exercise (termed exercise dependence by the authors) be
defined as a multidimensional maladaptive pattern of exer-
cise manifested by three or more of the following: tolerance
to higher levels of exercise, withdrawal symptoms, intention
effects (more exercise than was intended), loss of control,
time, conflict with other activities, and continuance despite
physical or psychological problems related to the exercise.
An evidence-based model developed by Meyer and col-
leagues (Meyer et al., 2011) suggested that the definition of
such exercise should refer to (a) weight and shape concerns
and (b) avoidance of negative affect and perceived negative
consequences of discontinuing the exercise.
Researchers have investigated the association between
excessive exercise and eating disorders to understand the
nature of their relation (Johnston et al., 2011). To date, studies
have demonstrated that the frequency and intensity of the exer-
cise (i.e., the quantitative dimension) are not associated with
disordered eating attitudes and behaviors (Adkins & Keel,
2005; Boyd, Abraham, & Luscombe, 2007; Lipsey, Barton,

Links Among Eating Disorder
Characteristics, Exercise Patterns, and
Psychological Attributes in College
Students
Bonnie J. Brehm1 and John J. Steffen2
Abstract
This study examined associations among eating disorder characteristics, excessive exercise, and selected psychological
attributes in college students (N = 499). Male and female participants were recruited from university psychology courses
and administered the Obligatory Exercise Questionnaire (OEQ), Mental Health Inventory, Eating Self-Efficacy Scale, Revised
Restraint Scale, and Eating Disorder Inventory. Results confirmed the multidimensionality of excessive exercise for both
males and females. Profiles of male and female exercisers were developed based on the clustering of scores on the OEQ's
factor analytically derived subscales. Specific qualitative aspects of exercise (e.g., emotionality and obsession), rather than
the quantity of exercise, were found to be associated with eating disorder traits and, for some groups, psychological distress
(PD). For other groups, such as female excessive exercisers, exercise seems to act as a coping mechanism, thereby lessening
PD and enhancing well-being.

Hulley,&Hill,2006;Mond,Hay,Rodgers,Owen,&Beumont,
2004; Mond, Myers, Crosby, Hay, & Mitchell, 2008). On the
other hand, the emotion-laden or qualitative dimension of
excessive exercise (i.e., exercising to control weight/shape,
feelings of compulsion, continuance despite interference with
other responsibilities) is linked with increased eating pathol-
ogy (Ackard, Brehm, & Steffen, 2002; Adkins & Keel, 2005;
Brehm & Steffen, 1998; Davis, Brewer, & Ratusny, 1993;
Matheson & Crawford-Wright, 2000; Mond et al., 2004, Mond
et al., 2008; Steffen & Brehm, 1999). Thus, it is not the amount
of exercise but rather its meaning within the context of the
person's life that may be related to eating disorders.
While Davis and colleagues (Davis et al., 1993) were the
first to examine the relations between exercising and specific
psychological variables among men and women, the major-
ity of research that followed this seminal study has focused
on the coexistence of exercising and eating- or weight-related
variables among female participants only. The results of
such studies that are limited to women may not be general-
ized to men. One study that examined associations among
excessive exercise, eating disorder behaviors, and certain
psychological traits in college women used cluster analysis
of OEQ subscale scores to identify distinct profiles of exer-
cisers, particularly a subgroup of excessive exercisers who
demonstrated clear links among exercise beliefs and behav-
iors, eating disorder characteristics, and psychopathology
(Ackard et al., 2002). Using the same method of typing exer-
cisers based on clustering OEQ scores, the aims of the pres-
ent study were (a) to determine if excessive exercise was
related to eating disorder and psychological characteristics in
college men, in a way similar to that found among women
and (b) to document additional psychological characteristics
of eating disorder­linked exercise in both men and women.
We surveyed participants about their attitudes and behav-
iors related to exercise and diet. In addition, we used mea-
suresofeatingself-efficacy,eatingrestraint,andpsychological
distress (PD) and well-being. It was expected that, consistent
with their generalized negative cognitive framework (De
Young & Anderson, 2010; Meyer et al., 2011; Stice, Bohon,
Marti, & Fischer, 2008), excessive exercisers will feel ineffi-
cacious with regard to their ability to control their eating
behavior, will likely engage in substantial restraint related to
eating behaviors, will be psychologically distressed and con-
versely low in well-being, and will exhibit disordered eating
behaviors and beliefs. Such findings will reaffirm the profiles
of female exercisers developed in prior research (Ackard
et al., 2002) and, more importantly, will inform the develop-
ment of male exercisers' profiles based on the clustering of
scores on the OEQ's factor analytically derived subscales.
Methods
Participants
Participants were students at a large Midwestern university
who volunteered in partial fulfillment of their introductory
psychology course requirements. Announcements of the
study and sign-up sheets were posted in the Psychology
Department. The study was approved by the university's
Institutional Review Board.
Participants included 528 college students (193 males,
306 females, 29 missing data on sex) between the ages of 18
and 48 (X = 20.18 (2.45)). Over half of the participants were
freshmen (51.7%), with sophomores (29.1%), juniors
(13.3%), and seniors (5.9%) also participating. In regard to
race and ethnicity, the majority of participants (77.4%) were
White, with the remainder being Black, non-Hispanic
(13.7%), Asian/Pacific Islander (6.9%), Hispanic (1.8%),
and American Indian/Alaskan Native (less than 1%). Among
males, the average Body Mass Index (BMI) was 23.96 ±
3.34 (range = 17.69-37.70); the average BMI for females
was 22.44 ± 3.98 (range = 14.82-37.69). Females reported a
higher current weight (135.77 ± 24.77 lbs.) than ideal weight
(124.72 ± 15.33 lbs.), while males' self-reported weight
(171.93 ± 27.01 lbs.) and ideal weight (173.01 ± 24.01 lbs.)
were similar.
Procedure
All questionnaires were completed in small groups of par-
ticipants with trained research assistants (RAs) as facilitators
over four academic quarters. The RAs obtained informed
consent from each participant and then distributed packets
containing the study questionnaires. Five orders of the instru-
ments were randomly chosen and used to counterbalance
order effects. Most participants completed the anonymous
questionnaires in approximately 1 hr. After returning the
questionnaires and optical scan answer forms, participants
were given credit slips, indicating that they had completed
the study in partial fulfillment of the requirements for an
introductory psychology course.
Measures
Participant/lifestyle characteristics.A brief questionnaire was
developed by the investigators to obtain information about
participants' age, sex, ethnicity, race, and year in school, as
well as self-reported height, weight, and ideal weight. Infor-
mation about the frequency of dieting and type, frequency,
and amount of time spent exercising was also obtained.
There are no data available on this measure's psychometric
properties as it was developed for use in the current study.
Exercise. The OEQ (Pasman & Thompson, 1988; Thompson
& Pasman, 1991) is a 20-item questionnaire that measures
attitudes and activities related to exercise. The instrument's
reliability and validity have been documented among oblig-
atory exercisers and sedentary individuals recruited from
road races, weight training facilities, and undergraduate
psychology courses (Pasman & Thompson, 1988) and
among runners (Coen & Ogles, 1993). Individuals report on
a 4-point Likert-type scale how often they experience each
Brehm and Steffen 3
exercise-related situation. Higher scores indicate a stronger
sense of obligation to exercise.
Mental health. The Mental Health Inventory (MHI; Veit &
Ware, 1983) is a 46-item measure of mental health status that
was developed for use in the Rand Medical Outcomes Stud-
ies. It is a hierarchically structured measure that has a first-
order overall measure, the Mental Health Index, 2
second-order subscales measuring Psychological Well-
Being (PWB) and PD, and 6 third-order constituent sub-
scales that measure Anxiety, Depression, and Loss of
Behavioral and Emotional Control (PD) and Emotional Ties,
General Positive Affect, and Life Satisfaction (PWB). There
has been a wide array of studies with diverse populations
attesting to this instrument's internal consistency, test-retest
reliability, construct validity, and criterion-related validity
(McDowell, 2006, pp. 247-253; Veit & Ware, 1983; Ware,
Manning, Duan, Wells, & Newhouse, 1984).
Eating self-efficacy.The Eating Self-Efficacy Scale (ESES)
is a 25-item questionnaire to assess perceived control over
food consumption, with demonstrated internal consistency,
test-retest reliability, and convergent validity among male
and female undergraduate college students (Glynn & Ruder-
man, 1986). The Negative Affect subscale reflects perceived
difficulty controlling eating when experiencing negative
feelings, while the Socially Acceptable Circumstances sub-
scale assesses difficulty controlling eating during social
occasions. Individuals rate their difficulty controlling eating
on a scale of 1 (no difficulty) to 7 (most difficulty) for each
of 25 conditions. Higher scores are indicative of less eating
self-efficacy.
Restrained eating.The Revised Restraint Scale (RRS; Her-
man & Polivy, 1980) is a 10-item self-report questionnaire
that assesses the extent of and concern about dieting. High
scores indicate elevated levels of dietary restraint. Internal
reliability of the RRS was high and similar (.77 and .78)
among both male and female college students (Klem,
Klesges, Bene, & Mellon, 1990). The scale's validity as an
indicator of the intent to diet and susceptibility for overeating
has been adequately documented in adult men and women
(Williamson et al., 2007).
Eating disorder characteristics. The Eating Disorder Inventory
(EDI; Garner, Olmstead, & Polivy, 1983) is a 64-item multi-
dimensional self-report instrument that assesses psychologi-
cal and behavioral characteristics of anorexia and bulimia
nervosa. Reliability estimates have been documented among
male and female students in undergraduate psychology
courses (Wear & Pratz, 1987), as well as content, construct,
and criterion-related validity in patient and nonpatient sam-
ples (Garner, 1991; Garner et al., 1983). The EDI has eight
subscales that assess specific eating disorder attitudes and
behaviors. Items are presented in a 6-point format and are
scored by assigning the three least pathological responses a
score of 0 and the other responses 1, 2, or 3 in order of lowest
to highest pathology. Higher scores reflect greater degrees of
the measured characteristic.
In the analyses that follow, the first step involves factor
and cluster analyses of the OEQ to identify excessive exer-
cise patterns, separately, in male and female participants.
Then types of exercisers are compared on the measures of
eating disorder and psychological characteristics.
Results
Factor Analysis
The OEQ was subjected to a principal axis factor analysis
with an oblique rotational solution (Direct Oblim in SPSS).
Oblique rotation was used because the factors appeared to be
moderately correlated with one another, even under an
orthogonal rotation. This analysis produced a four-factor
solution for both males and females that explained, respec-
tively, 54.8% and 54% of the variance in the item set.
Although there are slight differences between males and
females in the items constituting each factor, the majority of
them are similar. The Exercise Frequency/Intensity factor
includes items addressing the type and frequency of exercis-
ing and the drive to exercise; the Exercise Emotionality fac-
tor's items describe negative feelings associated with
exercising or lack of exercising; the Exercise Commitment
factor includes items that describe recording and scheduling
of exercise sessions; the Exercise Obsession factor's items
describe preoccupation with exercising and exercising
despite adversity.
Tables 1 and 2 contain the OEQ items, subdivided by
their factors, for males and females, respectively, with their
corresponding factor loadings and internal consistency reli-
abilities (Cronbach's ) for each factor scale. The reliabili-
ties were acceptable for all scales except for males' Factor 3
which was quite low (.374). For men, Factors 1 (Exercise
Frequency/Intensity) and 2 (Exercise Emotionality) were
moderately correlated with Factor 4 (Exercise Obsession) at
.431 and .537, respectively. Factor 3 essentially was not cor-
related with the other factors. For women, Factor 1 (Exercise
Emotionality) was slightly to moderately correlated with
Factor 2 (Exercise Frequency/Intensity), Factor 3 (Exercise
Obsession), and Factor 4 (Exercise Commitment), .279,
.365, and .386, respectively. In addition, Factor 2 was mod-
erately correlated (.423) with Factor 4.
Male Typology
Participants were then clustered with their OEQ subscale
scores as the clustering variables using Hierarchical Cluster
Analysis with Ward's Method on squared Euclidian dis-
tances in SPSS. For men, a three-cluster solution provided
the clearest differentiation among groups. Table 3 includes
descriptive statistics for the three cluster analysis-derived
groups of males on the OEQ subscales. Members of Group 1
4 SAGE Open
(n = 100) scored high on exercise frequency/intensity, aver-
age on exercise commitment, and low on emotionality and
obsession; thus, this group was labeled "Exercisers." Males
in Group 2 (n = 60) were characterized by low scores on all
four subscales and were labeled "Non-Exercisers." In con-
trast, participants in Group 3 (n = 33) scored high on all four
factors, particularly exercise emotionality and obsession, and
therefore were assigned the name "Emotional/Obsessive
(EO) Excessive Exercisers."
Separate univariate and multivariate analyses of variance
(MANOVA) and chi-square analyses were conducted to
examine the effects of the three cluster groupings on the dif-
ferent sets of variables. Effect sizes were estimated post hoc
using phi () and, following Cohen (1988), interpreting val-
ues of .10 as small, .39 as medium, and .50 as large. Eta
squared (2) was used to estimate effect sizes for univariate
analyses of variance, interpreting values of .01 as small, .059
as medium, and .138 as large. See Table 4 for means and
standard deviations of the variables.
Participant/Lifestyle Questionnaire.Chi-square or analysis of
variance, depending on the variable's metric, was used to
analyze this set of variables. There were no differences for
year in school, 2(6) = 5.7, ns; ethnicity, 2(6) = 8.2, ns;
height, F(2, 182) = 2.8, ns; weight, F(2, 182) = 1.8, ns; ideal
weight, F(2, 182) = 2.8, ns; or BMI, F(2, 182) = 2.7, ns.
However, there were significant differences for all of the
other variables.
EO Excessive Exercisers were more likely to have dieted
within their lifetime, 2(2) = 25.8, p < .001,  = .373, and
within the past year or currently, 2(8) = 28.8, p < .001,  =
.394, than the other two groups. As expected, both groups of
exercisers were more likely than non-exercisers to have ever
exercised, 2(2) = 25.1, p < .001,  = .368. Furthermore, EO
Excessive Exercisers had exercised more recently and cur-
rently, 2(8) = 56.1, p < .001,  = .558, as well as more often,
2(8) = 28.9, p < .001,  = .445, than the other groups. They
were also more likely to engage in both aerobic and anaerobic
exercises, 2(6) = 38.1, p < .001,  = .454. Finally, the groups

quency/intensity and exercise commitment; thus, this group
was labeled "EO Non-Exercisers." Women in Group 2 (n =

"Non-Exercisers." Group 3 participants (n = 124) were char-
acterized by slightly elevated scores on frequency/intensity

and low to average scores on obsession, commitment, and
emotionality; they were labeled "Average Exercisers."
Participants in Group 4 (n = 47) scored quite high on com-
mitment, frequency/intensity, and emotionality but average
on obsession; they were labeled "High Intensity Exercisers."
Group 5 members (n = 16) scored the highest of all groups on
emotionality, obsession, and commitment and second high-
est on exercise frequency/intensity and were labeled "EO
Excessive Exercisers."
Separate univariate and MANOVA examined the effects
of cluster membership on the different sets of variables. See
Table 6 for means and standard deviations of the variables.
Participant/Lifestyle Questionnaire.Chi-square or analysis of
variance, depending on the variable's metric, was used to
analyze this set of variables. There were no differences for
year in school, 2(12) = 11.6, ns; ethnicity, 2(12) = 16.3, ns;
height, F(4, 271) = 1.2, ns; or ideal weight, F(4, 268) = 1.7,
ns. Significant differences were obtained among clusters for
current weight, F(4, 270) = 3.8, p < .01, 2 = .053, and BMI,
F(4, 270) = 4.4, p < .01, 2 = .061, with post hoc tests indicat-
ing that only the Non-Exercisers weighed less and had lower
BMI than the EO Non-Exercisers (weight: Scheffé = 9.0,
p < .01; BMI: Scheffé = 3.0, p < .01).
Over 80% of EO Excessive Exercisers and 70% of EO
Non-Exercisers reported having ever dieted, 2(4) = 21.4,
p < .001,  = .279, and 73% of EO Obsessive Exercisers and
62% of EO Non-Exercisers reported "dieting right now or in
the past year," 2(16) = 32.5, p < .01,  = .345. At the other
end of the spectrum, only 39% of Non-Exercisers reported
past dieting and only 29% reported recent or current dieting.
While 100% of EO Excessive Exercisers and 93% of EO
Non-Exercisers reported having ever exercised, only about
53% of Non-Exercisers reported having done so, 2(4) = 41.9,
p < .001,  = .39. Over 70% of EO Excessive Exercisers and
High Intensity Exercisers reported most recent exercise,
2(12) = 80.9, p < .001,  = .548. A combination of aerobic
and anaerobic exercising was preferred by the majority of
members in all groups except the Non-Exercisers and EO
Non-Exercisers, 2(12) = 60.6, p < .001,  = .469. EO
Excessive Exercisers and High Intensity Exercisers were the
most likely to report exercising at least 1 to 3 days each week,
2(12) = 54, p < .001,  = .499. Finally, for amount of time
exercised, all groups exercised two to three times as long as
Non-Exercisers, F(4, 270) = 11.6, p < .001, 2 = .147 (Scheffé
range = 24.1 to 42.5, p < range = .01 to .001).
MHI.The MANOVA revealed significant effects for the
MHI subscales, F(8, 558) = 4.5, p < .001, with follow-up
ANOVAs having significant effects on PD, F(4, 279) = 7.8,
p < .001, 2 = .1, and PWB, F(4, 279) = 5.6, p < .001, 2 =
.074. For the PD subscale, EO Non-Exercisers scored sig-
nificantly higher than all other groups (Scheffé range = 16.2
to 20.1, p < range = .05 to .001). No other group scored sig-
nificantly different from any other group. For the PWB sub-
scale, EO Non-Exercisers scored significantly lower than the
other groups (Scheffé range = -11.3 to -9.4, p < range = .05
to .01) except for Non-Exercisers.
ESES.The MANOVA, F(8, 572) = 5.0, p < .001, and
follow-up ANOVAs found significant effects for both sub-
scales, Negative Affect, F(4, 286) = 8.1, p < .001, 2 = .101,
and Socially Acceptable Circumstances, F(4, 286) = 6.5,
p < .001, 2 = .084. On the Negative Affect subscale, EO
Excessive Exercisers scored significantly higher than all
other groups except for EO Non-Exercisers (Scheffé range
= 15.5 to 18.1, p < range = .005 to .001). On the Socially
Acceptable Circumstances subscale, EO Non-Exercisers

Discussion
The extent and nature of excessive exercise and its links with
eating disorders among either men or women are unclear and
still evolving. The absence of an operational definition of
excessive exercise has led to the use of various instruments
that measure sundry constructs; therefore, study results are
often contradictory, being dependent on the measurement
tool and the researcher's conceptualization of excessive
exercise. Defining excessive exercise by the amount of time
engaged in an exercise activity alone ignores its multifaceted
nature (Adkins & Keel, 2005; Meyer & Taranis, 2011).
The results of this study confirm past findings that exces-
sive exercise is a multidimensional concept (Ackard et al.,
2002; Steffen & Brehm, 1999). As previously demonstrated,
the OEQ has subscales that reveal multiple factors associated
with excessive exercise. In the current study, four factors that
were nearly identical for men and women were identified:
Exercise Frequency/Intensity, Exercise Emotionality,
Exercise Commitment, and Exercise Obsession. Similar to
prior research, some factors (i.e., Exercise Emotionality and
Exercise Obsession) describe negative consequences of
exercising or not being able to exercise (Ackard et al., 2002;
Boyd et al., 2007; Mond et al., 2008). Those who score high
on these factors feel concerned, guilty, and irritated when
they miss an exercise session and are driven to exercise in
spite of injury or fatigue.
The first aim of this study was to determine if excessive
exercise was related to eating disorder and psychological
characteristics in men, in a way similar to that found among
women. A review by Ricciardelli and McCabe (2004) con-
curred that several risk factors (e.g., exercising for weight
control and appearance) associated with disordered eating
among adolescent boys are similar to those found in girls.
Although research indicates that the biological, psychologi-
cal, and sociocultural risk factors related to the development
of disordered eating are similar among adolescent males and
females (Keel, Klump, Leon, & Fulkerson, 1998), such com-
parison studies are lacking in the area of excessive exercise.
To our knowledge, the present study is the first to develop
profiles of male exercisers based on the clustering of scores
on OEQ subscales and to examine the profiles of male exer-
cisers simultaneously with those of female exercisers.
Based on a factor-informed cluster analysis of male par-
ticipants, three subgroups were identified with distinctive
profiles related to exercise-related attitudes and behaviors.
Although almost 70% of the males (i.e., those in the
Exercisers and EO Excessive Exercisers groups) were cate-
gorized as exercisers by their Exercise Frequency/Intensity
scores, only the EO Excessive Exercisers displayed a pro-
pensity toward eating restraint and a drive for thinness,
essential characteristics of eating disorders. This analysis
continues to substantiate the premise that excessive exercise
is multidimensional, even for men, and that there appears to
be aspects of exercise, namely, exercise emotionality and
obsession, that are linked to PD and eating disorders. On the
other hand, exercise appears to relieve or buffer stress and
promote a sense of well-being for some persons, as shown by
the Exercisers' well-adjusted scores on the mental health
measures (i.e., lowest scores on distress and highest scores
on well-being).
The typology of the female exerciser differs from that of
the male in several ways. Rather than three distinct groups,
the cluster analysis identified five groups of females based
on OEQ factor scores. These groups are similar to the six
groups identified in previous research with female college
students (Ackard et al., 2002). Both studies revealed distinct
groups of maladjusted exercisers and non-exercisers who
demonstrated specific exercise beliefs and behaviors, eating-
disordered characteristics, and psychopathology, as well as
Brehm and Steffen 9
groups of exercisers and non-exercisers who were well-
adjusted in terms of psychological attributes.
In the present study, two groups (i.e., EO Non-Exercisers
and EO Excessive Exercisers) scored high on the Exercise
Emotionality and Exercise Obsession factors and also scored
significantly higher on eating disorder measures, such as
drive for thinness and both subscales of the ESES, indicating
perceived difficulty controlling eating during emotionally
negative and social occasions. Again, these findings reaffirm
prior work that demonstrated the significant link between
exercise-related cognitions and emotions and eating-disor-
dered traits, independent of exercise frequency (Ackard et
al., 2002; Steffen & Brehm, 1999). Curiously, there were no
substantive nor statistically significant differences between
these two groups on any measures except for the MHI sub-
scales of PD and Well-Being with the EO Non-Exercisers
faring significantly worse than the EO Excessive Exercisers.
These results lend some support to the notion that excessive
exercise may serve as a strategy to regulate affect for people
who have eating disorders (De Young & Anderson, 2010;
Meyer et al., 2011).
The second aim of this study was to identify additional
psychological attributes associated with eating disorder-
linked excessive exercise. Our findings related to this aim
are less clear cut. While both male and female EO Excessive
Exercisers scored highest or nearly highest on most eating
disorder characteristics, particularly eating restraint and
drive for thinness, male and female EO Excessive Exercisers
were not as differentially distressed on the MHI subscales.
The EO Excessive Exerciser males were similar to the Non-
exercisers in both well-being and distress but they appeared
to be more psychologically distressed than the Exercisers.
On the other hand, the EO Excessive Exerciser females
scored among the lowest on distress and highest on well-
being when compared with their counterparts. As noted ear-
lier, these findings suggest some psychologically palliative
effect of exercise.
Alternative factors that may contribute to the association
between excessive exercise and eating-disordered attitudes
and behaviors have been addressed by several researchers.
For example, diverse motives for exercise have been shown
to influence exercise and eating-disordered characteristics
differentially. Adkins and Keel (2005) found that health and
fitness motives were linked with less eating-disordered traits,
but a greater compulsion to exercise than other reasons for
exercising, such as appearance and weight management.
Mond and colleagues demonstrated that exercising for
weight or shape and extreme guilt after missing exercise
were strongly associated with eating disorder psychopathol-
ogy in both clinical and nonclinical samples (Mond &
Calogero, 2009; Mond et al., 2004; Mond et al., 2008).
Although motivation for exercise was not assessed in the
present study, it is possible that participants who were exer-
cising for intrinsic reasons did not display the maladjusted
psychosocial characteristics that were evident in exercisers
who were motivated by external appearance-related factors.
Study results showed that both male and female EO Excessive
Exercisers were more likely to have dieted within their life-
time and within the past year than other exercisers, and thus
may have been driven to exercise by extrinsic motivators
such as weight management. This might explain the exis-
tence of disparate groups of exercisers (i.e., those with well-
adjusted and those with maladjusted psychological attributes)
among both male and female participants.
In the current study, the presence of an EO Non-Exerciser
group among females, but not males, may be related to
greater concern about weight and appearance and the high
prevalence of body dissatisfaction among female undergrad-
uate students (LePage, Crowther, Harrington, & Engler,
2008; Tiggemann & Williamson, 2000). The majority of EO
Non-Exercisers reported dieting now and in the past. Perhaps
their weight-related concerns, accompanied by guilt about
not engaging in exercise, are linked with their increased psy-
chopathology, as previously demonstrated in excessive exer-
cisers (Mond & Calogero, 2009).
The regulation of negative affect is another common
motive for exercising, particularly among females. A
recent study showed that those who undertake exercise to
improve negative emotional states tend to exhibit an
"obligatory" compulsion to exercise, eating-disordered
behaviors and concerns, and lower self-esteem (De Young
& Anderson, 2010). It is important to note that the quality,
not the quantity, of exercise differed between those who
exercised to alleviate negative affect and those who did
not, reaffirming the multidimensionality of excessive exer-
cise. These study results suggested that exercising for
mood regulation is potentially harmful and may be a "red
flag" for associated psychopathology. On the other hand,
negative affect is significantly lessened from pre- to post-
exercise (De Young & Anderson, 2010; LePage &
Crowther, 2010). Thus, for some persons, exercise may be
an effective method of coping with negative emotional
states. Again, the motivation to exercise (i.e., regulation of
negative affect) may have contributed to the present
study's discovery of groups of exercisers that are dissimi-
lar in terms of psychological health.
In general, outcome-oriented motives for exercise have a
negative impact on psychological health. However, Calogero
and Pedrotty-Stump have demonstrated that "mindless"
unhealthy exercise that focuses on outcomes rather than pro-
cess may be reduced by practicing new patterns of exercise
and modifying the motivators and contexts of mindless exer-
cise (Calogero & Pedrotty, 2004, 2007; Calogero & Pedrotty-
Stump, 2010). Importantly, the adoption of process-focused
exercise diminishes the "obligatory" emotional element of
exercise (Calogero & Pedrotty, 2004). Programs aimed at the
prevention or treatment of eating disorders may benefit from
the inclusion of mindful exercise (i.e., positive mindset
toward exercise) that is associated with improved psychopa-
thology (Calogero & Pedrotty-Stump, 2010).

This study has several limitations to its design and the
external validity of its findings. A chief limitation is its reli-
ance upon self-report and any unanticipated response biases
that may consequently ensue. However, the consistency of
our results with past studies adds a degree of credibility to
our finding of the links between certain types of emotion-
laden excessive exercise and eating disorder beliefs and
behaviors. The generalizability of our findings is clearly lim-
ited to the population of college students and may not apply
to those persons of other demographics. Replication of our
methods of typing exercisers using dissimilar populations
would be beneficial.
Conclusions
Excessive exercise is a multifaceted concept that cannot be
defined solely by the frequency of the activity; it must also
consider the exerciser's emotions and cognitions about the
exercise. Consistent with previous research, those frequent
exercisers who are emotional and obsessive about their
exercise routines are likely to display eating disorder
behaviors such as drive for thinness, eating restraint, and
some other psychological maladjustment. While males
who fit this profile of the excessive exerciser (i.e., those
who score high on the Emotional and Obsession factors)
showed increased PD, it appears that excessive exercise
may act as a coping mechanism for females with a similar
profile, thereby lessening their PD and enhancing well-
being. With our societal emphasis on physical fitness,
exercise itself may become psychologically rewarding and
socially reinforcing, perpetuating its intensity and
frequency.
This study provides evidence for the existence of dis-
crete types of exercisers (both male and female) who are
represented by clusters of psychosocial characteristics.
Future research is needed to confirm the typologies of male
and female exercisers developed in this study. Longitudinal
studies would provide important information related to the
developmental sequencing of excessive exercise and eating
disorders and the directionality of their relationship. In the
meantime, clinicians should be aware of the link between
excessive exercise and eating disorders to screen better for
the co-occurrence of these conditions. They should further
assess the emotionality and obsession toward exercising
and interruption of exercise routines, as well as eating-
related attitudes and behaviors, of those patients who exer-
cise frequently (Thome & Espelage, 2007). While exercise
may buffer the PD caused by disordered cognitions related
to exercise and eating, attention to potential co-existing
psychopathologies is essential.
