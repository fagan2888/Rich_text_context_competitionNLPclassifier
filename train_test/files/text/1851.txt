Abstract
Background: Obesity is disproportionately prevalent among many racial/ethnic minority
communities. The efficacy of weight control efforts in these groups may depend on individual's
ability to accurately perceive their weight status. We examined whether racial/ethnic differences
exist in weight status misperception among overweight adults.
Methods: Nationally-representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) 1999­2002 were examined. Participants included overweight and obese adult
men (n = 3115) and women (n = 3437). Weight status misperception was identified among
respondents who self-reported being "about the right weight/underweight."
Results: Blacks (OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.71, 2.54) were twice as likely and Hispanics (OR = 1.70,
95%CI: 1.33, 2.17) were 70-percent more likely than Whites to misperceive their weight, in models
adjusted for age, education, income, marital status, self-reported health, and self-reported medical
diagnosis of overweight. Black overweight (OR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.26, 3.26) and obese (OR = 3.56,
95% CI: 1.57, 8.11) women were considerably more likely to exhibit misperception compared to
their White female counterparts. Odds of misperception were higher among overweight Black (OR
= 2.20, 95%CI: 1.54, 3.15), Hispanic (OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.30, 2.75), and obese Black men (OR =
2.84, 95% CI: 1.54, 5.22), compared to White men.
Conclusion: Weight status misperceptions among the overweight are more common among
Blacks, and Hispanic men. The persistence of racial/ethnic differences after adjustment for medical
diagnosis of overweight may suggest some resistance to physician weight counseling. Identifying
strategies to correct weight status misperceptions status may be necessary to ensure the efficacy
of clinical and public health obesity interventions conducted among these groups.
Introduction
The epidemic of obesity in the US shows no signs of abat-
ing ­ presently, over 65% of the US population are either
overweight or obese [1]. Many racial/ethnic populations
are disproportionately affected by the condition; non-His-
panic Black women, for example, are more than twice as
likely to be obese, compared to non-Hispanic White
women[1]. Obesity control efforts conducted among
racial/ethnic minority populations may be hindered by
numerous sociocultural factors that influence both dietary

and physical activity patterns [2]. For example, Blacks
appear to have a greater social acceptance of overweight,
less body weight dissatisfaction, and higher body weight
ideals compared to Whites [2-8]. Additionally, emerging
evidence in nationally-representative cohorts suggest that
Blacks, and to a lesser extent Hispanics, may have lower
rates of perceived overweight compared to Whites [9-11].
Indeed, Kuchler et al [9] reported that overweight Blacks
and Hispanics were significantly more likely to perceive
themselves to be at average weight, compared to Whites.
Inaccurate weight status perceptions have been posited to
drive obesity-related behaviors, such as food consump-
tion and intentional physical activity [2,9-11]. Impor-
tantly however, much of the data examining perceived
weight status were collected prior to the secular shift
towards greater U.S. public awareness of the obesity epi-
demic and its associated comorbidities. A consequence of
this heightened awareness has been calls for greater physi-
cian diagnosis and counseling for weight loss among over-
weight and obese patients [12-16]. No previous studies
have examined racial/ethnic differences in perceived
weight status remain after controlling for self-reported
receipt of medical diagnosis of overweight.
Thus, the purpose of the present study was to examine
whether racial/ethnic differences exist in perceived weight
status among overweight adults (accounting for receipt of
medical diagnosis of overweight), using data from the
1999­2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey studies.
Methods
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) is a stratified, multistage probability sample of
the civilian non-institutionalized U.S. population
[17,18]. NHANES includes over sampling of Mexican-
Americans and non-Hispanic Blacks. Approximately 9965
persons aged 2 months to 85 years were studied in
NHANES 1999­2000 and 11,309 persons in NHANES
2001­2002. Race/ethnicity was self-reported by partici-
pants; we categorized individuals as: non-Hispanic White,
non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, or other. Height and
weight were measured using a standardized protocol at a
Mobile Examination Center (MEC)[19,20]. Body mass
index (BMI) was calculated as kg/m2; we utilized standard
thresholds to classify individuals as normal/underweight
(BMI<25), overweight (25<=BMI<30), or obese
(BMI>=30). Covariates included: age (in years); education
(categorized in the three levels available in public release
data: less than high school, high school diploma, more
than a high school degree); income (<$20,000, $20­
34,999, $35­54,999, $55,000+); martial status (married/
cohabitating, widowed/divorced/separated, never mar-
ried), self-reported health status (excellent, very good,
good, fair, poor; collapsed into three categories due to
small numbers), and; self-report of a medical diagnosis of
overweight (yes/no). All analyses were limited to individ-
uals aged 18 and older, who were overweight or obese,
and did not report being pregnant. Statistical analyses
were performed using SUDAAN (version 9, Research Tri-
angle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). Sample
weights account for differential non-response, non-cover-
age and intentional over-sampling of some groups. Logis-
tic regression was used to examine the likelihood of
misperception overall, by BMI class, and jointly by BMI
class and gender.
Perceived weight
Participants were asked a standard perceived weight ques-
tion, "Do you consider yourself now to be overweight,
underweight, or about the right weight?" [21,22] As all
study participants were overweight (or obese), we consid-
ered those whose responses placed them in a combined
"about the right weight/underweight" category to exhibit
"misperception" or "inaccurate" perceptions of their
weight status. Through use of this terminology, we make
no attempt to suggest that respondents either intention-
ally or non-intentionally exhibited inaccuracies in their
weight perceptions, as our data do not allow for the
explicit examination of this question.
Results
The prevalence of weight status misperception varied by
race/ethnicity and gender. Across racial/ethnic categories,
men were more likely to misperceive their weight than
women (Table 1). Comparing racial/ethnic categories, for
both men and women, Blacks were most likely and
Whites least likely to misperceive their weight status. For
both men and women, across racial/ethnic categories, the
prevalence of weight status misperception was higher
among overweight, than among obese participants.
Among women, the prevalence of misperception was
highest among overweight Black women (40.9%) and
lowest among obese White women (3.9%). Similarly,
among men, misperception rates were highest among
overweight Black men (66.4%), and lowest among obese
White men (8.9%).
In multivariable analyses adjusting for all covariates,
Blacks (OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.71, 2.54) were twice as
likely, and Hispanics (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.33, 2.17)
were 70-percent more likely than Whites to misperceive
their weight. When examining overweight and obese par-
ticipants separately, the association was stronger for both
overweight Blacks (OR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.54, 3.15) and
Hispanics (OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.30, 2.76) as well as obese
Blacks (OR = 2.84, 95% CI: 1.54, 5.22). The association
was attenuated and not significant among obese Hispan-
ics (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 0.69, 3.07).

When examining men and women separately (Table 2),
overweight Black women were twice as likely as over-
weight White women to misperceive their weight (OR =
2.03, 95% CI: 1.26, 3.26). Overweight Hispanic and
White women were equally likely to misperceive their
weight (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 0.85, 2.13). Among obese
women, Blacks were over three times as likely as White
women to misperceive their weight (OR = 3.56, 95% CI:
1.57, 8.11). Obese Hispanic women were twice as likely as
obese White women to misperceive their weight, though
the difference was not significant (OR = 2.19, 95% CI:
0.96, 5.01).
Both overweight Black (OR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.54, 3.15)
and Hispanic (OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.30, 2.75) men had
higher odds of misperception, compared to White over-
weight men. However, among obese participants, only
Black men had an increased likelihood of weight status
misperception (OR = 2.84, 95% CI: 1.54, 5.22), compared
to their White counterparts.
Discussion
The disproportionately elevated and steadily increasing
rates of overweight and obesity among racial/ethnic
minority communities [1] constitutes a major public
health crisis. The major determinants of the obesity epi-
demic in all populations ­ dietary and physical activity
practices ­ may be heavily patterned by sociocultural
influences, such as the tendency to misperceive one's
weight status. In the present study, we found that over-
weight and obese Blacks, compared to their White coun-
terparts, were disproportionately more likely to categorize
themselves as being "about the right" weight.
Overweight Black men and women each had more than a
two-fold increased likelihood of perceiving their weight
status. Relative to Whites, obese Black adults were even
more likely to exhibit weight status misperceptions. These
results were independent of sociodemographic character-
istics, traditional individual-level measures of socioeco-
nomic position, and self-reported receipt of physician
diagnosis of overweight. Our findings highlight the
importance of more frequently incorporating sociocul-
tural factors, particularly perceived weight status, into
both clinical and public health obesity reduction
approaches for Blacks.
Racial/ethnic differences in perceived weight among
women have been previously shown; however, most stud-
ies have been conducted among relatively small, select
samples, including high proportions of college students.
Among the few previous studies conducted using nation-
ally-representative data, Paeratakul et al (in the 1994­
1996 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals
and the Diet and Health Knowledge Survey) showed that
Whites were 2.3 times more likely than non-Whites to per-
ceive themselves to be overweight. However, the authors
failed to disaggregate the non-White category to examine
whether Blacks and/or Hispanics had higher odds of inac-
curate perceptions. In the NHANES III cohort, Kuchler
and Variyam [9]reported that the prevalence of perceived
overweight was lower among both overweight and obese
Blacks, compared to Whites. Trends for Hispanic respond-
ents in the study were similar to those of Blacks; however
the prevalence of misperception among obese Hispanics
did not significantly differ from Whites. Kuchler and Var-
iyam's analysis was limited to the presentation of preva-

lence data; however, this allows us to compare the
prevalence of misperception in the NHANES III cohort
(1988­1994) to our data in the NHANES 1999­2002
samples. Over a period of time characterized by secular
trends for weight gain in the general population, misper-
ception rates among Black in particular, continued to
increase among both men and women. Among over-
weight men, the prevalence of misperception increased in
all racial/ethnic groups (White: 8%, Black: 14%, Hispanic:
22%); however, for obese men, misperception rates
decreased for both Whites and Hispanics by about 13.5%,
while over the same period they increased by over 49% for
Blacks. Among women, sizeable increases were seen in the
prevalence of perceived normal weight among both White
and Black overweight (44% and 52% respectively) and
obese (16% and 21% respectively) women. However,
among Hispanic women, a 5% decrease in mispercep-
tions was seen for both overweight and obese women.
What might explain the greater potential for overweight
Blacks to misperceive their weight status? As has been pre-
viously mentioned, considerable research evidence has
identified myriad sociocultural influences (e.g. heavier
body image ideals, fewer social pressures to lose weight)
that might be implicated [2-8]. An unanswered question
concerns whether Blacks' tendency to misperceive their
weight status is a function of weight satisfaction, or a lack
of awareness about the extent of their overweight. Given
previous evidence of Blacks' high levels of weight satisfac-
tion, it is possible that responses to the studied perceived
weight question may have been biased among those who
were more weight satisfied. Alternatively, our findings
may highlight a lack of awareness about the clinical
thresholds for overweight and obesity; this limited aware-
ness may be influenced by the high prevalence of the con-
ditions among Blacks. We have previously speculated
that, rather than considering their membership in BMI-
defined categories, some Blacks might rely on social com-
parison to make judgments about their respective weight
status. Given that overweight and obesity among Blacks
(particularly among women) has reached nearly norma-
tive levels, such social comparison among the overweight
might negatively bias individuals' judgments about their
respective weight status. Whether this potential mecha-
nism extends to Black men (given their lower absolute lev-
els of overweight and obesity compared to women) is
unclear. The mechanisms responsible for Blacks' weight
status perceptions may be particularly important to dis-
cern, given our finding that misperceptions persisted after
adjustment for self-reported physician diagnosis of over-
weight.
We were surprised to find that racial/ethnic differences
going perceived weight remained after adjusting for
adjustment for receipt of physician diagnosis of over-
weight. Physician diagnosis and counseling for weight
reduction among the overweight has increasingly been
recommended, [12-16] though its frequency remains low
[23]. Given that Blacks remained more likely to misper-
ceive their weight after adjustment for the diagnosis vari-
able, we hypothesize that some Black patients might be
resistant to physician diagnoses of overweight. Generic
messages of a patient's overweight (i.e. those that do not
discuss the clinical thresholds of overweight in some
detail, provide a description of the health risks associated
with overweight and obesity), or non-comprehensive
counseling may have little effect, particularly given that
many Blacks do not recognize the health consequences of
overweight and obesity [11] and may not be readily moti-
vated by weight-related aesthetic concerns. However, as
weight status misperception may also protect against eat-
ing and body image disorders (which are less common
among Blacks), misperception correction strategies
should be carefully considered.
Our study has several strengths and extends prior findings
in a number of important ways. First, rather than present-
ing only prevalence data, our focus was to systematically
examine sources of racial/ethnic variation in perceived
weight status, adjusted for relevant confounders. Our data
were collected during the period of time when public
awareness of obesity and its associated health conse-
quences increased dramatically. One might have expected
the greater public attention to obesity occurring during
this period to have enhanced individual's ability to more
accurately perceive their weight status. Of course, a
number of considerations may limit interpretations
drawn from our findings. BMI as a measure of body
weight does not incorporate body fat distribution, which
may be differentially associated with obesity-related
health conditions by race/ethnicity. Furthermore, the var-
iable reflecting physician diagnosis of overweight was not
time-delimited (e.g., prior 12 months), thus providing
some possibility of temporal differences in the time since
receipt of diagnosis. However, responses to this variable
are unlikely to vary systematically by race/ethnicity. Small
cell sizes in some categories may have impacted our esti-
mates. Finally, Mexican-Americans are overrepresented in
the NHANES category; thus, there should be cautioned
own revelations made to other Hispanic sub-groups.
Correcting misperceptions of weight status may be neces-
sary to actively and successfully engage individuals in
overweight and obesity control efforts. As increasing
attention is directed towards the treatment and preven-
tion of obesity among racial/ethnic minorities, identify-
ing similar disproportionately prevalent sociocultural
influences should be a high priority.
