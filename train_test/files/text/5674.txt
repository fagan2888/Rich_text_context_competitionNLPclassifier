Introduction
The role of Streptococcus pneumoniae in chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
patients during both stable state and exacerba-
tion is controversial.1 Lower respiratory tract
infections (LRTIs) due to S. pneumoniae carry
a significant morbidity and mortality world-
wide, especially among elderly people, immu-
nocompromised patients and those affected by
chronic respiratory diseases.2­5 As new thera-
pies have not been developed over the past 20
years, vaccination seems to be one of the major
tools to reduce the burden of pneumococcal
disease, especially among patients with known
risk factors for LRTIs, such as those with
COPD.2,6,7
The overall rate of pneumococcal colonization
in COPD patients and its role during exacerba-
tion is difficult to evaluate. The potential bene-
fit of recent vaccination programs designed for
these patients is still unknown and data regard-
ing vaccination coverage and distribution of
pneumococcal serotypes in COPD patients dur-
ing stable state and exacerbation are lacking.8­11

Abstract
Background: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of exacerbations due to
Streptococcus pneumoniae in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients during
stable state.
Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational, cohort study including stable COPD
patients, who were evaluated at least every 4 months over a 24-month period at the
Respiratory Unit of the IRCCS Policlinico Hospital in Milan, Italy, from 2012 to 2015. Sputum
samples were collected at enrollment during stable state to evaluate the frequency of S.
pneumoniae colonization and in case of an acute exacerbation to evaluate the incidence of
pneumococcal infection.
Results: A total of 79 stable patients with moderate to very severe COPD were enrolled. A total
of 217 samples were collected, and 27% (n = 59) of those were positive for S. pneumoniae.
A total of four exacerbations due to S. pneumoniae occurred during follow up (0.31 per 100
person/month). Among positive samples of S. pneumoniae, 109 serotypes were identified. The
most frequent serotypes in moderate-to-severe COPD patients during both stable state and
exacerbation were 19F (12%), 18 (10%), 19A and 9V (9%) and 35 F (7%). Only 32% of COPD
patients were effectively vaccinated for S. pneumoniae with PPV23 vaccine.
Conclusion: The most frequent S. pneumoniae serotypes in COPD patients are 19F, 18, 19A,
9V and 35 F, and that almost 50% of S. pneumoniae strains could be covered by PCV13 in adult
COPD patients.

COPD patients are currently available, and
real-life data on respiratory tract infections due
to S. pneumoniae in Italy are lacking.1 Specifically,
there is a lack of data regarding the type and rate
of vaccination in COPD patients and moreover
pneumococcal serotypes involved are not well
characterized. Therefore, we aimed at describ-
ing the real-life incidence of exacerbations due
to S. pneumoniae in COPD patients during sta-
ble state.
Methods
Study design
We conducted a prospective, observational,
cohort study including stable COPD patients
who were evaluated at least every 4 months over a
24-month period at the Respiratory Unit of the
IRCCS Policlinico Hospital in Milan, Italy, from
2012 to 2015.
Study population
Inclusion criteria. All outpatients with a diagnosis
of moderate-to-severe COPD at the enrollment
visit and presence of at least one exacerbation
during the past year (but not in the last 30 days)
and chronic sputum production. Ethics approval
of study protocol, protocol amendments,
informed consent forms and other relevant docu-
ments were obtained prior to study initiation from
the Independent Ethic Committee. Informed
consent was obtained by each patient prior to
enrollment in the study.
Exclusion criteria
Patients with a diagnosis of asthma or bronchi-
ectasis at the enrollment visit or with immuno-
suppressive or other life-threatening disorders.
Study definitions
Moderate-to-severe COPD was defined as a
forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced
vital capacity (FVC) ratio < lower limit of normal
(LLN) and FEV1 < 60%.
COPD exacerbation was defined as a sustained
worsening of the patient condition from the stable
state and beyond normal day to day variations,
acute in onset and needing a change in regular
medication. A stable disease was considered as
absence of exacerbation episodes during the last
30 days.
S. pneumoniae colonization was present when S.
pneumoniae was found in two different sputum
cultures recollected within 4 months from each
other, in absence of an exacerbation event.
Exacerbation caused by an S. pneumoniae infec-
tion was defined as the concomitant presence
(during the same visit) of an ongoing exacerba-
tion according to clinical evaluation and a sputum
sample positive for S. pneumoniae.
Data collection
At each visit, demographic information and med-
ical history, including the presence of a pre-exist-
ing microbial colonization, were collected and
physical examination performed. Moreover, at
each visit patients were questioned about the sta-
tus of their chronic respiratory symptoms in order
to identify previous or ongoing episodes of
exacerbation.
Microbiological work up
Sputum samples were collected at enrollment
during stable state to evaluate the frequency of S.
pneumoniae colonization and in case of an acute
exacerbation to evaluate the incidence of pneu-
mococcal infection. All samples were analyzed for
pathogen identification at the Policlinico Hospital
(local laboratory) and for polymerase chain reac-
tion (PCR) testing, antibiotic resistance patterns
and serotyping of S. pneumoniae samples in
Florence, Italy (central laboratory). DNA was
extracted by a commercial kit for PCR amplifica-
tion. To confirm the extraction, each DNA sam-
ple was tested for its ability to be amplified with
B-globin specific primers. S. pneumoniae was
detected using real-time PCR, and the same tech-
nique was used to find the presence of specific
antibiotic resistance genes (specifically for beta-
lactam, macrolides and quinolones). PCR was
used also to describe the different serotypes of S.
pneumoniae, finding the different serotype genes.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were run using SPSS 20
(IBM). Categorical data are presented as absolute
number (n) and percentage (%). Normally dis-
tributed data are shown as mean with standard
deviation, whereas non-normally distributed data
M Mantero, S Aliberti et al.
journals.sagepub.com/home/tar 405
are presented as median with interquartile range
(IQR). The incidence rate was computed as the
number of exacerbations concomitant to S. pneu-
moniae infection divided by the person-time of
observation.
Results
A total of 79 stable patients with moderate to very
severe COPD was enrolled. The majority of them
were male (81%) and former smokers (59%),
with a median (IQR) age of 74 (70­78.5). Median
(IQR) duration of COPD was 6.6 (3.6­10.4)
years.
The number of exacerbation episodes in the
previous year was and 2.0 (1.0­3.0). A total of
68% of patients had an influenza vaccination
during the year before, while only 32% of
patients had a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine
(PPV23) vaccination during the previous 10
years, despite national guidelines suggesting
that every COPD patient should receive a pneu-
mococcal vaccination.2
A total of 59 (91%) patients had at least one spu-
tum sample collected during the study period. A
total of 217 samples were collected, and 27%
(n = 59) of those were positive for S. pneumoniae.
Among patients with a positive sample for S.
pneumoniae, 17 (27%) patients were found to be
colonized at least at one visit during the follow-
up period: in particular, 16 (25%) and 3 (5%)
patients were colonized at 4-month and 8-month
follow-up visits, respectively.
Overall four exacerbations due to S. pneumoniae
occurred during follow up (0.31 per 100 person/
month). COPD exacerbations were 37, and were
mostly treated with levofloxacin (49%) and
amoxicillin/clavulanate (19%).
Among positive samples for S. pneumoniae, 109
serotypes were identified. The most frequent
serotypes in moderate-to-severe COPD patients
during both stable state and exacerbation were
19F (12%), 18 (10%), 19A and 9V (9%) and 35
F (7%). Only 32% of COPD patients were effec-
tively vaccinated for S. pneumoniae with PPV23
vaccine.
Finally, we found that pneumococcal strains iden-
tified in our population were resistant to neither
macrolides, nor beta-lactams nor quinolones.
Discussion
The most frequent serotypes in moderate-to-
severe COPD patients during both stable state
and exacerbation were 19F, 18, 19A, 9V and 35
F. The serotypes identified in our study are con-
sistent with previous experiences, except the
interesting new finding of high prevalence of sero-
type 35F.1,6­10 Few recent studies showed an
increase of serotype 35F among children carriers,
especially after the extensive use of pneumococcal
conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and adult patients with
both invasive and noninvasive pneumococcal dis-
ease, even if it was more likely to be associated
with colonization than disease.11,12
According to our results, we might speculate that
PCV13 could potentially be protective in about
48% of isolated serotypes in COPD patients,
findings partly consistent with previous studies
that show a potential coverage from PCV13
between 34% and 80% of cases.1,8­11
In patients with COPD, S. pneumoniae,
Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis
are the main pathogens causing acute exacerba-
tion of COPD (AECOPD) episodes1,13,14 These
bacteria may chronically colonize the airways and
cause exacerbations after a simple viral upper res-
piratory infection or an environmental stress.15
Nevertheless, studies also point out that a signifi-
cant number of AECOPD infections may come
from bacterial strains that are new to the patient.13
Pneumococcal vaccination could be useful both
in decreasing S. pneumoniae colonization and
therefore subsequent exacerbations, and in
decreasing new pneumococcal infections in non-
colonized patients.
Moreover, another interesting finding of our
studies is absence of antibiotic resistance, particu-
larly macrolide resistance, which is, on the con-
trary, described in previous studies.16­18 This
result could potentially affect the choice of antibi-
otic therapy for S. pneumoniae, at least in our geo-
graphical area.
A major limitation of our study consists of its
monocentric design which impacts the generaliz-
ability of our results. Another limitation consists
of the clinical challenge to discern between an
acute COPD exacerbation and a pneumococcal
pneumonia, in the setting of outpatients with a
positive sputum culture for S. pneumonia. Adding
Therapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 11(10)

a chest X-ray (CXR) to the evaluation may also
not resolve the situation in obese patients or in
elderly patients with several comorbidities, as
their CXR findings could be equivocal.
However, this is the first prospective and real-life
experience in Italy designed according to a high
level microbiological investigation with the aim at
identifying the proportion of COPD colonization
and acute exacerbations attributable to S. pneumo-
niae and describing serotype distribution and antibi-
otic resistance patterns of pneumococcal isolates.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our study found that the most fre-
quent S. pneumoniae serotypes in COPD patients
are 19F, 18, 19A, 9V and 35 F, and that almost
50% of S. pneumoniae strains could be covered by
PCV13 in adult COPD patients.
