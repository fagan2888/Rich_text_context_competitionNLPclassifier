This article investigates the impact of postretirement employee benefits on the likelihood
that workers expect to retire before age 62 and age 65. Using data from the 1992 Health
and Retirement Study, probit regression models were estimated to explore the effect of
pension plans and retiree health insurance on the expectation of early retirement. With
respect to pension plans, the effects of both the type of pension plan and the expected
benefits from those plans are explored. Similar effects were explored for retiree health
benefits. The results indicate that postretirement pension benefits and the availability of
retiree health benefits have a significant influence on workers' retirement age expectations.

Over the last three decades, the United States has
experienced an extraordinary withdrawal of older men
from the labor force. In 1965, 85% of men ages 55-
64 were participating in the labor force, compared
with 68% in 1985 (U.S. Department of Labor, 1988).
Since the mid-1980s, the labor force participation rate
of men ages 55-64 has been relatively constant, fluc-
tuating between 65% and 68%. The labor force par-
ticipation rate of men ages 45-54 also declined dur-
ing this time period, but close to 90% in this age group
continued to participate in 1997 (U.S. Department of
Labor, 1998). In contrast, the labor force participation
rate of women ages 45-54 and ages 55-64 contin-
ued to rise steadily through 1997.
Public policy interest in early retirement derives from
concern about the ability of the economy to support
larger numbers of retirees with the resources produced
by a proportionately smaller number of workers. In
1950, there were 16.7 workers for every Social Secu-
rity beneficiary (Employee Benefit Research Institute,
1997). Today there are roughly 4 workers per retiree
and that number is expected to decline to roughly
2.5 by the year 2030. The paradox facing public policy
makers is that increased life expectancy nas led to a
U.S. policy that seeks to encourage a longer work life
(e.g., the phased-in increase in the normal retirement
age for Social Security benefits and the elimination
of mandatory retirement), while early retirement is
more common today than in the past. Public- and
private-sector employee benefits may be playing a large
role in the retirement process, a role that is working
against increased work life. Public obligations to pro-
vide benefits to early retirees are limited because

Social Security does not provide any retirement ben-
efits before age 62 and Medicare is not available until
age 65. Nevertheless, earlier retirement is an issue for
public programs because it reduces the earnings base
that supports Social Security and Medicare spending
for older retirees.
Early economic research addressing the determi-
nants of retirement interviewed retirees to examine
why they retired when they did (Quinn, Burkhauser,
& Myers, 1990). Researchers gathered subjective re-
sponses and were forced to conclude that retirement
incentives were not a factor because they were rarely
mentioned. As a result, recent research has focused
on objective measures of retirement behavior by
focusing on how retirees behaved. Overall, most re-
cent research shows that economic incentives to
retire play an important role in retirement decisions.
Another way to explore whether economic incen-
tives play a role in retirement is by examining the
workers' intended retirement patterns. With the ex-
ception of Anderson, Burkhauser, and Quinn (1986),
Ekerdt, DeViney, and Kosloski (1996), Hall and John-
son (1980), Holtmann, Ullmann, Fronstin, and Longino
(1994), and Hurd and McGarry (1993), there is little
recent research focusing on workers' expected retire-
ment patterns. Even the previously mentioned studies
do not focus on the economic incentives of employee
benefits.
Employers and policy makers are interested in reli-
able forecasts of future retirement patterns because
they are important in formulating both employment
policy and public policy. For example, will the up-
coming increases in the eligibility age for full Social
Security benefits have the expected effect of in-
creasing the labor force participation of older work-
ers? Ultimately, the retirement process may be better
understood by examining workers' retirement expec-
tations at a moment in time, what affects those ex-
pectations, and how those expectations may change
over time as workers gather additional information on

Social Security benefits, potential pension income, and
retiree health benefits. This approach is in contrast
to taking a "look back" at eventual behavior where
researchers are inevitably forced to rely on the un-
certain memories of retirees who may have retired
10-15 years prior to data collection. An examination
of retirement outcomes leave the process of retire-
ment and retirement decisions unobserved. In fact, pre-
vious research has shown that survey responses on re-
tirement expectations are reliable predictors of future
retirement, conditional on the information that was
available at the time that individuals were planning
their retirement process (Honig, 1994, 1996; Hurd &
McGarry, 1994).
This article examines early retirement decisions and
how they relate to employee benefits. This article im-
proves upon previous research in a number of ways.
First, I take full advantage of data on postretirement
employee benefits. Previous studies examining the role
between early retirement and employee benefits have
not fully utilized the data. For example, Ekerdt and
colleagues (1996) used data from the 1992 Health and
Retirement Study (HRS) but did not examine different
types and combinations of pension plans, and did not
include retiree health benefits in their analysis. Hurd
and McGarry (1993) also used data from the HRS but
used an outcome variable that measured the prob-
ability of working full-time past age 62, which does
not fully account for complete withdrawal from the
labor force. Hall and Johnson (1980) used data from
the 1969 Retirement History Study, and Holtmann and
colleagues (1994) used data from the 1984 Survey of
Income and Program Participation.
The next section presents the rationale for the ef-
fects of economic incentives on early retirement deci-
sions. The following section presents data from the
1992 Health and Retirement Study concerning how
employee benefits influence workers' expected retire-
ment patterns. The last section discusses public policy
implications.
Methods
Theoretical Considerations
The job-stopping process generally is initiated by
the termination of career employment and frequently
includes periods of postcareer employment, part-time
work, partial retirement, and temporary retirement
(Ruhm, 1991). Previous research has established that
retirement can be defined as a process, instead of a
single event (Quinn & Kozy, 1996). Workers often use
one or more transitional stages, or bridge jobs, be-
tween their career job and complete withdrawal from
the labor force. One common transitional stage is the
movement from full-time work to part-time work. This
usually occurs for wage and salary workers when they
switch jobs, but it also may occur for workers in their
current jobs.
The process of retirement varies with individual pref-
erences, predicted future earnings, pension accruals,
Social Security benefits, health, and preferences for
leisure. A person's job-stopping process and subsequent
choice of retirement age (defined here as his or her
complete withdrawal from the labor force) may be
made by weighing the combined benefits of the wages
from continuing to work and the potential increase in
future income from accruing greater pension benefits
against the costs of forgoing the increased leisure of
retirement and the cost of forgoing future pension ac-
cruals. To be realistic, the decision should account for
risks, including uncertain future income, inflation, and
premature death. Testing whether people account for
these risks, however, would be mathematically diffi-
cult (Fields & Mitchell, 1984).
Health insurance coverage also might help explain
the retirement process. Employer-sponsored health
insurance for individuals not participating in the labor
force can be a significant source of income security
for early retirees, because Medicare, the federal
health insurance for retirees, is not available to people
younger than age 65 unless they are disabled. Although
early retirees as a group are probably healthier than
those ages 65 and older, the risk of medical need in-
creases with age. Early retirees without health insur-
ance may be vulnerable to costly medical expenses.
Individually purchased health insurance policies can
be expensive, may restrict coverage for certain ser-
vices, and may be unavailable for persons with pre-
existing conditions who lack prior creditable health
insurance coverage. Group health insurance through
an employer is usually the most affordable source of
health insurance coverage for early retirees and may
be an important variable in the retirement decision.
Retiree Health Insurance.--An Employee Benefit
Research Institute (EBRI) public opinion poll indicates
that there is a direct link between a worker's deci-
sion to retire early and the availability of retiree health
insurance (EBRI, 1998). In 1998, 74% of workers re-
ported that they would not retire before becoming
eligible for Medicare if their employer did not pro-
vide retiree health benefits. Yet the same survey
shows that 45% plan to retire before age 65. The sur-
vey also found tnat 82% of the respondents believed
they would need additional health insurance cover-
age beyond what is provided by the Medicare pro-
gram, and 47% expected their former employer to
provide retiree health insurance.
The rationale for why availability of retiree health
insurance should affect the retirement process is
straightforward, as noted by Madrian (1994). There is
a direct link between labor force participation and
health insurance coverage. Almost 75% of wage and
salary workers ages 18-64, have employment-based
health insurance coverage (Fronstin, 1996). This in-
surance is portable into retirement only in the sense
that some workers have the option of continuing their
coverage under Consolidated Omnibus Budget Rec-
onciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), which requires em-
ployers with 20 or more workers to offer continued
access to group health insurance coverage to quali-
fied beneficiaries for up to 18 months. Otherwise,
without the availability of retiree health insurance,
retirees may not have access to health insurance cov-
erage until age 65, though some may have access to

insurance through a spouse. Although some workers
have access to retiree health insurance, most do not
have it or even know if they would have coverage if
they retired. For example, previous research found that
34% of workers aged 45 or older worked for an em-
ployer that sponsored retiree health insurance either
throughout tneir retirement (29%) or only until age
65 (5%) (Yakoboski et al., 1994). Although 15% re-
ported that retiree health insurance was unavailable,
21% did not respond to the question or did not know
the answer, and 30% did not have access to health
insurance through their employer. If one assumes that
the 21% who did not know the answer or did not
respond to the question do not have access to retiree
health insurance, then 66% of workers aged 45 or
older do not have access to retiree health insurance.
Workers considering leaving the labor force early
could obtain health insurance prior to becoming eli-
gible for Medicare either through a spouse or the pri-
vate market for insurance. However, purchasing health
insurance in the private market may not be afford-
able. Employers that provide access to group health
insurance often are able to obtain lower premiums
than individuals can because insurance companies
spread risk across a larger group of people, and the
average administrative costs are lower. In addition, the
need for health insurance increases with age (Mad-
rian, 1994). Older individuals are relatively more likely
to be in fair or poor health, they are more likely to
report having been diagnosed with a serious health
condition, and they spend a greater proportion of their
family income on medical expenses. As a result, lack
of health insurance during retirement could be an im-
pediment to leaving the labor force prior to age 65.
Employment-Based Pension Plans.--Employment-
based pension plans can facilitate or encourage work-
ers' withdrawal from the labor force, including some
workers who may not yet be eligible for Social Secu-
rity benefits. From a conceptual perspective, employer
pensions may be thought of as falling into one of two
categories: defined contribution and defined benefit
plans. Defined contribution plans create different eco-
nomic incentives than defined benefit plans. From the
perspective of the employee, the defined contribu-
tion plan is essentially a savings vehicle and provides
no incentive to leave the labor force at any particular
age. The defined contribution account allows a worker
to accumulate assets that may be sufficient to support
labor force withdrawal at an early age, but the worker
need not attain any particular age to use those assets
in retirement.
Although defined contribution plans have no in-
trinsic retirement age, the differing tax treatment of
benefits from defined contribution plans at different
ages may influence the retirement process. Defined
contribution plans commonly distribute assets to their
participants in the form of lump-sum distributions.
Before age 591/2 the recipient may be subject to a
10% penalty tax on the lump sum (in addition to regu-
lar income tax). Therefore, participants planning to
take such distribution may have an incentive to delay
the distribution of assets until age 59V2. On the other
hand, the defined contribution plan participant can
avoid the penalty by rolling the distribution into a quali-
fied annuity rather than receiving it as a lump sum.
Moreover, the penalty tax may be circumvented by
taking distributions that are part of a series of substan-
tially equal periodic payments made for the life (or
life expectancy) of the employee or the joint lives (or
joint life expectancies) of the employee and his or
her beneficiary.
In a defined contribution plan, the employer may
make a specified periodic contribution to the employee's
pension account. Some plans accept or may even re-
quire employees' contributions as a condition of par-
ticipation in the plan. Investment gains or losses in
the plan are credited to the employee's account; the
employer bears no investment risk. Once vested, the
value of employees' pension assets is not contingent
on how long they remain with the firm. As long as
employees actively participate in the plan, they can
continue to accumulate assets.
Defined benefit plans typically promise a specified
benefit on retirement from a job, usually based on
the employee's earnings and length of service, for the
life of the employee or surviving spouse. Because in-
creases in the employee's salary with continued work
can raise the amount of pension benefits attributable
to past service, the value of pension benefits accrued
each year increases as the worker approaches the
earliest age for reduced retirement benefits, a phe-
nomenon known as "backloading," though a career-
average plan instead of a final-salary plan substantially
reduces this effect (Clark & McDermed, 1988). How-
ever, in most pension plans there is a typical age
where pension wealth is at a maximum and contin-
ued work, especially into late ages, triggers a reduc-
tion in the present value of pension wealth from con-
tinuing to work (Jppolito, 1997).
Typically, employer plans calculate early retirement
benefits as a percentage of the accrued pension ben-
efit that would have been paid at the normal retire-
ment date. The pension benefit is actuarially reduced
to reflect the participant's longer benefit payout pe-
riod and lost investment earnings on plan assets. Dur-
ing the interval between the plan's early retirement
age and the normal retirement age, employers often
adjust the pension benefit in a more or less economi-
cally fair way (Ippolito, 1997). A fair actuarial reduc-
tion gives full recognition to the longer payout period
and lost investment earnings (Allen, Melone, Rosen-
bloom & VanDerhei, 1992). However, once the worker
reaches the normal retirement age, which may or may
not be before age 65, the worker is penalized for each
additional year of work.
During limited "window periods," employers may
offer enhanced retirement benefits to encourage early
retirement to reduce the size of their work force. Casn
bonuses, additional age and service credits, and con-
tinued insurance benefits may be offered to employ-
ees who retire early.
Social Security.--Some analysts argue that the struc-
ture of Social Security benefits creates incentives for
early retirement (Betley, 1990). The Social Security
Vol. 39, No. 1,1999 39
benefit received at retirement depends on age and
earnings received in the highest-paid years of work.
Currently, at age 62, covered workers can elect to
receive 80% of the full retirement benefit available at
age 65. For each month after age 62 that a worker
postpones benefits, the reduction of 20% decreases
0.56% (or 8.3% of the age 62 benefit per year). In
addition, the credit for delayed retirement will increase
for each year the initial benefit is postponed up to
age 70. Tnis structure results in an incentive to leave
the labor force at ages 62 and 65, and offers little
incentive to leave the labor force between ages 62
and 65, but then it creates a big disincentive to work
after age 65 for the average worker (Ippolito, 1997).
Although it should be noted that very few workers
are average, and life expectancy and rates of time
preference will either create an incentive or disincen-
tive to continue working past ages 62 and 65, a re-
cent study, which includes a review of the literature,
suggests that subjective survival probabilities show
considerable promise for estimating models of de-
cision making under uncertainty (Hurd & McGarry,
1995). This would imply that the average worker will
apply a given set of rules to his or her own personal
circumstances. Specifically, this implies that retirement
expectations are reliable predictors of future retire-
ment, conditional on the information that was avail-
able at the time that individuals were planning their
retirement process.
Another disincentive to continue working is the
"earnings test." Social Security benefits of beneficia-
ries ages 65-69 are reduced by one dollar for every
three dollars of earnings that exceeds an annual limit
($14,500 in 1998). Retirees with substantial pension
incomes, Social Security benefits, and savings may not
have incentives to work anyway, and analysts believe
that the earnings test by itself has a limited effect on
work effort. However, a relatively small group of retir-
ees (about 2% of retirees ages 65-69) appear to limit
their work effort to avoid losing Social Security ben-
efits. These people are most likely to increase their
hours of work as a result of a change in the earnings
test (Leonesio, 1990).
The Social Security Amendments of 1983 will in-
crease the normal retirement age incrementally from
65 to 67 by the year 2027, reduce the early retire-
ment benefits payable at age 62 from 80% of the full
retirement benefit to 70%, and increase the credit for
delayed retirement by one-half of one percentage point
every other year, or from 3% to 8% per year after the
/ear 2007. Although these changes make the Social
Security benefit formula actuarially more fair, analysts
have estimated that they are of insufficient magnitude
to have a major effect on retirement decisions (Fields
& Mitchell, 1987).
Data
The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) allows
researchers to examine the role of the economic in-
centives of employee benefits on retirement patterns.
The HRS, originally conducted in 1992, is a national
ongitudinal study focusing on individuals born be-
tween the years 1931 and 1941. As a result, the age-
eligible population was between the ages of 51 and
61 at the beginning of the study. A total sample of
more than 9,000 age-eligible respondents were in-
terviewed in 1992 and they will be followed and re-
interviewed in future years to study their retirement
patterns. In addition, the survey collected data on de-
mographics, physical health, housing and mobility,
family structure, current and past employment, retire-
ment plans, income, and insurance.
Because the focus of this article is on retirement ex-
pectations, the sample is limited to non-self-employed
workers. Individuals have also been excluded if they
were working part-time--defined as less than 35 hours
per week as they may have already started the retire-
ment process by cutting back on work hours. Some
individuals in the sample analyzed in this article will
be affected by the Social Security normal retirement
age increase. Because Fields and Mitchell (1987) ex-
pect the change to not have a major effect on the
retirement process, the changing eligibility age is not
controlled for in this study. In fact, the age 62 predic-
tions presented in the next section are not affected
by the increase in the eligibility age. Although the
spouses of the age-eligible individuals were also inter-
viewed in the survey, I did not include them in the
analysis in this article, even if the spouse was not born
between 1931 and 1941. However, some of their data
are matched to the age-eligible individual.
After excluding nonworkers and the self-employed
I am left with a sample of 5,040. Excluding part-time
workers reduces the sample size to 4,322. In order to
gather information on health insurange coverage for
secondary respondents in the sample, family mem-
bers had to be matched. After excluding observations
for missing data on retirement expectations, missing
matches, and other missing data, the final sample is
4,268: 2,420 men and 1,848 women. Sample statis-
tics are shown for men and women in Table 1, and
the means for more detailed postretirement benefit
data are shown in Table 2 for men.
Measures
Workers were asked a series of questions about
their anticipated retirement patterns, such as whether
they planned to stop working altogether, never stop
working, continue as they were, work fewer hours, or
change the kind of work they do, and workers who
planned to stop working were asked a follow-up ques-
tion to determine the planned age of retirement.
Workers were allowed to choose all of the options
that applied. However, in this analysis, workers were
not allowed to report more than one option. For ex-
ample, if a worker reported that he or she planned
to stop working, then that answer took precedent over
all other options. The distribution of the reported
answers did not change significantly after restricting
the choice of options. According to Table 3, 6.3% of
men and 6.7% of women reported that they planned
to stop working before age 62. An additional 11.5%
of men and 12.5% of women planned to stop work-
ing between ages 62 and 64. In contrast, women were

much more likely than men to report that they had
not given much tnought to retirement (33.9% for men
and 38.9% for women).
Workers with a pension plan were more likely to
report that they expected to stop working before age
62 and before age 65 than workers without a retire-
ment plan. This is true for both men and women. In
addition, for workers with a retirement plan, those with
a defined benefit plan--whether or not they had a
supplemental defined contribution plan--were more
likely to expect to stop working before age 65 than
workers witn only a defined contribution plan. Finally,
workers who expected to receive retiree health ben-
efits were more likely to expect to stop working be-
fore age 65 than workers not expecting retiree health
benefits.
Results
In order to understand the relationship between ex-
pected retirement patterns and employee benefits, a
series of probit models are estimated. Two dependent
variables are measured: the probability of expecting to
stop working (hereafter referred to as retire) before
age 62 and the probability of expecting to retire be-
fore age 65. These ages were chosen to correspond to
the eligibility age for early and full Social Security ben-
efits. Separate estimates are presented in Table 4 for.
men and women. In the first two columns of Table 4,
the probit results on the probability of expecting
to retire before age 62 are presented for men and
women. Columns 3 and 4 contain the probit results on
the probability of expecting to retire before age 65.

ficantly affect the probability of retiring early for men,
but not for women. Men with a primary defined ben-
efit plan combined with a supplemental defined con-
tribution plan were more likely than men without any
pension plan to expect to retire before age 62. They
were also more likely to expect to retire before age
65. Men with a defined benefit plan with no defined
contribution plan were also more likely than men with-
out any pension plan to expect to retire before age
62 and age 65. Although the effect of a stand-alone
defined contribution was to increase the probability
of expecting to retire before age 62 for men, this
effect was less significant than the defined benefit
effects. It was not significant in the age 65 equation.
With the exception of a small statistically significant
effect for stand-alone defined benefit plans in the age
65 equation, none of the pension plan effects were
significant for women.
The availability of retiree health benefits appears to
affect the expectation that male workers will retire be-
fore ages 62 and 65. The effect is significant at the
5% level in the age 62 equation and at the 1% level
in the age 65 equation. This may suggest that as a
man gets closer to eligibility for Medicare he is more
likely to be influenced to retire before being eligible
for Medicare the shorter the waiting period for Medi-
care. The effect of retiree health insurance was insig-
nificant for women in both equations.
Although this study is not estimating a full simulta-
neous model of joint decision making for married in-
dividuals, it is important to control for spousal charac-
teristics because the availability of a pension or re-
tiree health insurance may have an influence on a
spouse's retirement process. I found that the effect of
spousal characteristics does not matter for men but it
has a limited effect for women. Specifically, a married
man whose spouse has a defined benefit plan with a
supplemental defined contribution plan is not more
likely to expect to retire early when compared with a
married man whose spouse does not have a pension
plan. In contrast, a married woman whose spouse has
a defined benefit plan with a supplemental defined
contribution plan is significantly more likely to expect
to retire before age 62, but not age 65.
Overall, few other explanatory variables signifi-
cantly affected the probability of expecting to retire
early with a few exceptions. Turning to the influence
of marital status on the propensity to expect to retire
early, the results reflect the asymmetric influence of
marital disruption on women compared to men. The
probability that women will plan to retire before age
65 is significantly reduced after a divorce. The prob-
ability of expecting to retire before age 62 is also
significantly lower for widowed women. In contrast,
marital status has absolutely no significant effect on
the probability of retiring early for men. The fact that

married women have a higher probability of expect-
ing to retire early than divorced or widowed women
may be partly attributable to the fact that married
women may be less likely to continue, working if their
spouses retires early (though the argument could also
be made that women would prefer to stay in the
labor force after a spouse retires).
Expected Benefits
Although the type of pension plan may have a sig-
nificant impact on a worker's retirement expectation,
the expected benefit from the pension plan may have
an even more important effect on the labor force par-
ticipation decision. In Table 5, estimates are presented
for a probit model that uses a set of dummy variables
to account for the expected benefit in retirement. The
actual reported expected benefit for workers with a
primary defined benefit plan is used instead of a single
dummy variable. In the HRS, expected benefits for
defined benefit plans were reported a number a ways.
Workers were allowed to report the amount that
they expected to receive either as a percentage of
pay or as a dollar amount per year. Workers were
also allowed to report whether they expected to re-
ceive a lump-sum distribution. Some workers reported
that they did not know what income to expect in re-
tirement from their defined benefit plan. For workers
with a defined contribution plan, the amount accu-
mulated in the account was used in the model.
The first column in Table 5 contains the parameter
estimates from a probit model on the probability that
a male worker plans to retire before age 62. The sec-
ond set of probit estimates contains the probability

that a male worker plans to retire before age 65. Re-
sults from women are not presented because the sample
size of the expected benefit variables were too small
to yield reliable estimates.
Overall the results using expected benefits were
mixed. Men with defined benefit plans were more
likely to plan to retire before age 62 than men with-
out a defined benefit plan when they expected to re-
ceive either 60-79% of their pay in retirement and
when they expected to receive between $10,000 and
$50,000 annually. Workers with more than $50,000
in their defined contribution accounts were more likely
than other workers to expect to retire before age 62.
In the age 65 equation, the results are similar with
the exception that even workers expecting a relatively
small annual annuity expect to retire before age 65.
This result suggests that the closer an individual is to
receiving Social Security and Medicare, the more willing
he would be to retire early given a smaller level of
postretirement benefits.
Workers with a relatively high level of expected
benefits from a defined benefit plan were not more
likely to retire before either age 62 or 65 than either
workers with less generous benefits or workers with
no defined benefit plan. As mentioned above, defined
benefit pension plans typically base benefits on some
combination of years of service and final pay. If one
assumes that these workers are at the high end of the
income distribution, then one would expect them to
continue working longer in life because of the oppor-
tunity cost associated with leaving the labor force.
I also found that workers who expect their former
employers to pay for all or some of their retiree health
benefits were more likely to expect to retire before
age 62 than workers whose employers offer the ben-
efit but are not expected to subsidize it.
Predictions
Table 6 contains the predicted probability of expect-
ing to retire early based on the probit equation esti-
mates presented in Table 4. The predictions are calcu-
lated at the variable means. I found that the prob-
ability of expecting to retire before age 62 for men is
1.1% if there is no pension plan, 6.4% if the person has
a defined benefit plan with a supplemental defined
contribution plan, and 6.5% if the person has a defined
benefit plan without a supplemental defined contribu-
tion plan. Individuals with a defined benefit plan are
also roughly 43% more likely to expect to retire before

age 62 than individuals with a stand-alone defined con-
tribution plan. This effect falls to between 18% and
25% for those expecting to retire before age 65, again
suggesting that the shorter the time to full Social Secu-
rity and Medicare benefits, the less of an effect these
differences have on expectations.
Men who do not expect retiree health insurance
have a 2.9% chance of expecting to retire before age
62 compared to 4.6% of men who do not expect re-
tiree health insurance. In other words the probability
of expecting to retire before age 62 increases by 59%
if retiree health insurance is available. The difference
in the probability of expecting to retire before age 65
falls to 28% for those expecting and not expecting re-
tiree health insurance.
Although the predictions for women are presented
in Table 6, they are less meaningful, as there are fewer
significant effects in Table 4. For example, the prob-
ability of a woman expecting to retire before age 65
decreases with the availability of retiree health insur-
ance because the coefficient in Table 4 is negative
(but statistically insignificant).
Discussion
Americans are living longer, healthier lives. How-
ever, because Americans, especially men, are perma-
nently withdrawing from the labor force at earlier ages
than in the past, financing of the Social Security and
Medicare programs is becoming an increasing chal-
lenge. The Medicare trust fund already is in negative
cash flow and is expected to be depleted by 2010.
The Social Security trust fund is projected to enter a
state of negative cash flow in 2020, with depletion of
the trust fund following in 2032, according to the pro-
jections presented in the 1998 trustees report (Board
of Trustees, 1998). Although the size of the federal
budget as a percentage of gross domestic product has
not changed significantly in recent years, entitlements
such as the Social Security and Medicare programs
are accounting for an increasing proportion of the
federal budget (Quinn, 1996). Given the changing
demographics of the United States, these projected
trends are not sustainable. The baby boom generation
will start to withdraw from the labor force in 2011,
just after the projected depletion date of the Medi-
care trust fund. Hence, the projected trends are not
even sustainable in the short run.
Even though the normal retirement age for Social
Security benefits is 65, and most individuals do not
qualify for Medicare benefits before age 65, many
Americans continue to withdraw from the labor force
prior to age 65. Some analysts have concluded that
employee benefits play a large role in the labor force
withdrawal of older Americans. Increased retirement
income from public and private sources appears to
have been the main cause of the trend toward early
retirement. Benefit provisions allowing early retirement
may reflect employer and employee preferences for
relatively short work lives rather than more frequent
periods of leisure during a lengthier work life. How-
ever, future declines in the number of new entrants
into the labor force may increase the demand for la-
bor and lead employers to increase incentives for older
workers to stay on the job longer.
Changes to laws and regulations affecting early re-
tirement have been proposed as a way to encourage
older workers to stay employed longer. However, re-
ducing employer flexibility in structuring compensa-
tion may interfere with the ability of employers and
employees to negotiate a compensation package that
reflects changing needs over the course of a work life.
Policy makers might want to enhance the ability to
choose freely between retirement and work. Attempts
to encourage a longer working life might be framed
as an effort to encourage flexibility in retirement to
supplement resources and account for unanticipated
changes in resource needs.
