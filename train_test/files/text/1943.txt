Is education causally related to better health?
A twin fixed-effect study in the USA

Accepted 13 May 2009
Background More years of schooling is generally associated with better health.
However, this association may be confounded by unobserved
common prior causes such as inherited ability, personality such as
patience, or early family circumstances. The twin fixed-effect
approach can potentially address this problem by cancelling these
factors between twin pairs. The purpose of this study is to identify
the causal effects of education on health and health behaviours
using a twin fixed-effect approach.
Methods We used twin data from the National Survey of Midlife
Development in the United States, 1995­1996. The study population
included 302 male [55.6% monozygotic (MZ) and 44.4% dizygotic
(DZ)] and 387 female twin pairs (47.3% MZ and 52.7% DZ). A
range of health outcomes [perceived global, physical and mental
health, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist­hip
ratio, number of depressive symptoms] and health behaviours
(smoking and physical activity) were examined among twin pairs
who were discordant on years of schooling.
Results Among MZ twins, more years of education was associated with
better perceived global health. For all other health outcomes/beha-
viours, the point estimates of the effect of education in the fixed-
effect analyses suggested a weak protective association. Among
DZ male twins, each additional year of schooling lowered the prev-
alence of smoking by 32% [odds ratio (OR): 0.68, 95% confidence
interval (CI): 0.48­0.97] in the fixed-effect analysis.
Conclusion The widely reported associations between schooling and health out-
comes/behaviours may not reflect causal relationships in every
instance. Although low statistical power may explain some of the
null associations, our twin fixed-effect analyses suggest that at least
some cases of the education/health relationship reflect confounding
by unobserved third variables.

Introduction
Educational attainment has been reported in the lit-
erature to be robustly associated with higher levels of
both physical and mental health, as well as healthier
patterns of behaviour.1­7 However, causal inference
remains challenging due to confounding of the asso-
ciation by unobserved personal characteristics, such
as inherited ability, patience or early family circum-
stances. For example, although the inverse association

between educational attainment and cigarette smok-
ing is well established, the relationship is not neces-
sarily causal. Farrell and Fuchs8 examined the
relationship between schooling and smoking within
a community sample of adults who had all completed
12­18 years of education, and found that educational
inequalities in smoking observed in adulthood
(mid-20s) were already evident at age 17 when all
of the subjects were still in the same grade. In other
words, educational inequalities in smoking were
already evident even before schooling was actually
completed. This suggests that a third variable such
as intelligence, or patience (i.e. the ability to put off
enjoyment of things in the present in exchange
for future benefit)--as opposed to schooling per se--
might be responsible for the observed association
between schooling and cigarette smoking. Indeed, IQ
and education are highly correlated and a growing
body of research suggests a link between IQ and mor-
tality/morbidity.9­11
Recent studies in the USA have attempted to iden-
tify the causal effect of schooling on health through
the use of instrumental variables, which seek to purge
the correlation between education and unobserved
confounds such as cognitive ability and personality.
Compulsory schooling laws in the state of one's
birth have been used as an instrument for education,
based on the argument that compulsory schooling
laws serve as `natural policy experiments', whereby
children born in states that mandated longer school-
ing, in fact, ended up with more education. These
studies using instrumental variable estimates have
found strong associations between education and
reduced risk of mortality12 as well as better cognitive
functioning at older ages.13
A different approach to identify the causal effect of
education on health is the use of twin- or sibling-
fixed-effect designs. Krieger et al.14 showed that
female twins discordant on occupational class differed
with respect to systolic and diastolic blood pressure
and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In the same
study, twins who were discordant on education did
not vary by the health outcomes examined. Osler
et al.15 reported an analysis of twins who were discor-
dant on social class (defined by type of employment
and vocational education). Among dizygotic (DZ)
twins, they found associations of occupational class
with height and cognitive score for males and physi-
cal activity score for females. However, the same rela-
tionships were not observed among monozygotic
(MZ) twins, leading the authors to conclude that
the relationship between occupational class and
health is due mainly to selection effects (i.e. those
who have better health enjoy higher social class)
rather than a causal effect. One limitation of these
prior twin studies is that they dichotomized socio-
economic position (high vs low) so they could not
assess `dose­response' of health outcomes across
years of schooling. In order to examine the impact
of additional years of schooling, a fixed-effect model
is superior to stratification analysis.16
The National Survey of Midlife Development in the
United States (MIDUS) in 1995­1996 includes twin
data, which provide detailed educational attainment,
health outcomes and health behaviour information.
The current study hypothesized that differences in
educational attainment influence the health and
health behaviours of twins sharing the same genetic
background and family environment. The MIDUS
twin data were used to identify the causal effect of
educational attainment on health and health beha-
viours among twin pairs, MZ and DZ, who shared
the same family environment in childhood. If a pos-
itive association was observed in both MZ and DZ
twin pairs, this provides evidence of a causal effect
of schooling on health. If a positive association was
observed only in DZ twins, the association between
health and education may be still confounded by
genetic factors. If both the DZ and MZ twin pairs
showed null associations, this suggests that the rela-
tion between schooling and health is biased by unob-
served confounders such as inherited ability, early
family environment or health selection effects.
Methods
Study population
Details of the sampling procedures have been
explained elsewhere.17 Twin pairs were recruited by
using a separate two-part sampling design. The first
part involved screening a representative national
sample of $50 000 households for the presence of a
twin. The screening was conducted by International
Communications Research, the market research group
of AUS Consultants and Bruskin Associates.
Respondents who indicated the presence of twins in
the household or being part of a twin pair themselves
were asked permission to be contacted by a research
team for inclusion in the first national study of twins.
The presence of a twin in the family was reported by
14.8% of the respondents, of whom 60.0% gave per-
mission to be contacted for the twin study. The
second part of the twin sample design was carried
out by interview staff at the Institute for Social
Research (the University of Michigan) who contacted
the twin households in order to recruit twins to par-
ticipate in the survey. The cooperating twins were
asked to provide contact information for their co-
twins. Almost half (49%) of the first contacts identi-
fied twin pairs who did not meet the eligibility criteria
of the study (aged between 25 and 74 years, non-
institutionalized, living in the continental USA and
English speaking). The final response percentage for
complete twin interviews was 26%. The final response
percentage for the twin pairs varied according to
whether the first contact was with a relative of the
twin (20% response percentage) or the twin himself
IS EDUCATION CAUSALLY RELATED TO BETTER HEALTH? 1311
or herself (60% response percentage). The final twin
sample included a total of 1996 twins, resulting in
998 pairs.
Since the impact of education on health potentially
varies by gender,18 different-sex DZ twins (n ¼ 526;
263 pairs) were excluded. We also excluded twins in
whom the zygotic status was unknown (n ¼ 32;
16 pairs). Finally, we excluded twin pairs if one of
the pair reported that they had lived separately
before the age of 14 years (n ¼ 58; 29 pairs among
MZ and same-sex DZ twins). The final study sample
included 1378 individuals or 689 twin pairs (final
percentage: 18% of eligible twins)--351 (male: 168,
female: 183) pairs of MZ (50.9%) and 338 (male:
134, female: 204) pairs of DZ twins (49.1%).
Measurements
Twin pairs were interviewed by a telephone question-
naire, which inquired about educational attainment,
three health outcomes (perceived physical and mental
health and number of depressive symptoms) and sev-
eral types of smoking behaviour (further details
below), followed by a self-administered mailed ques-
tionnaire, which inquired about four additional health
outcomes [perceived global health, body mass index
(BMI), waist circumference (WC) and waist­hip ratio
(WHR)], as well as physical activities. The telephone
interview was completed by 924 twin pairs (92.6%)
and the self-administered mail questionnaire was
completed by 807 twin pairs (80.9%).
In the telephone survey, educational attainment was
assessed by asking the highest grade of school or
years of college completed. The responses were categor-
ized into 12 groups: no school/some grade school,
eighth grade/junior high school, some high school, gen-
eral educational development (GED), graduated from
high school, 1­2 years college (no degree yet), 3 years
of college (no degree yet), graduated 2 years college
(vocational or associate degree), graduated 4 or 5
years college (bachelor degree), some graduate school,
masters degree, doctor degree (PhD, EdD, MD, DDS,
LLB, LLD, JD) or other professional degree. We then
assigned the average number of years of schooling to
each category as follows: no school/some grade
school ¼ 4, eighth grade/junior high school ¼ 8, some
high school ¼ 10, GED ¼ 11, graduated from high
school ¼ 12, 1­2 years college (no degree yet) ¼ 11.5,
53 years college (no degree yet) ¼ 15.5, graduated 2
years college (vocational or associate degree) ¼ 14,
graduated 4 or 5 years college (bachelor degree) ¼ 16.5,
some graduate school ¼ 17, masters degree ¼ 18 and
doctor degree (PhD, EdD, MD, DDS, LLB, LLD, JD) or
other professional degree ¼ 20. Perceived physical
health was assessed using a single question: `In general,
would you say your physical health is . . ..' with Likert-
scale responses ranging from poor, fair, good, very good,
or excellent.
Perceived mental health was also assessed using a
single question: `What about your mental or
emotional health?' with Likert-scale responses ran-
ging from poor, fair, good, very good or excellent.
The responses `poor' and `fair' were collapsed a priori
into a single category, since the lowest category (poor)
by itself was too small to allow meaningful statistical
analysis (0.9%). To assess depressive symptoms, ques-
tions in the Composite International Diagnostic
Interview Short Form (CIDI-SF) were used. The
assessed depressive symptoms were (i) lack of interest
in most things, (ii) feeling more tired or having lower
energy than usual, (iii) loss of appetite, (iv) sleeping
difficulties, (v) difficulty concentrating, (vi) feeling
down, bad or worthless and (vii) increased thoughts
of death. The total number of depressive symptoms
was examined as a mental health outcome.
For smoking, we examined the following behaviours
separately: (i) ever smoking, (ii) age at starting to
smoke regularly, (iii) current regular smoking, (iv)
number of cigarettes smoked per day during the
1 year in life when the individual smoked most heav-
ily, (v) experience of trying to quit smoking and
(vi) age at the time when the individual last
smoked regularly. The smoking variables were all
dichotomous (yes/no), except the number of ciga-
rettes per day (which was asked only for current
smokers).
In the mailed questionnaire, perceived global health
was assessed using a single question: `Using a scale
from 0 to 10 where 0 means the worst possible health
and 10 means the best possible health, how would
you rate your health these days?' To calculate BMI,
height and current weight were asked. To measure
waist and hip circumference, a tape measure was
enclosed and respondents were provided with instruc-
tions to (i) take the measurements while standing,
(ii) avoid measuring over clothing, (iii) record
answers to the nearest quarter inch and (iv) follow
the figure shown in the questionnaire booklet to
guide where to take the measurements. The physical
activity was assessed by four questions: `During the
summer, how often do you engage in vigorous phys-
ical activity (for example, running or lifting heavy
objects) long enough to work up a sweat?'; `What
about during winter--how often do you engage in
vigorous physical activity long enough to work up a
sweat?'; `During the summer, how often do you
engage in moderate physical activity (for example,
bowling or using a vacuum cleaner)?'; and `What
about during the winter--how often do you engage
in moderate physical activity?'. The responses were
in six categories: several times a week or more,
about once a week, several times a month, about
once a month, less than once a month and never.
These questions have been validated in previous stud-
ies,19­21 taking account of seasonal differences.22
Zygosity was determined as identical or fraternal
twins using self-report data collected as part of the
initial twin-screening questionnaire. In cases where
the respondent was unsure, DNA analysis was
1312 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
performed on returned cheek cell samples. Similar
methods of diagnosing zygosity have been shown to
be 490% accurate in diagnosing twin zygosity.23
Analysis
First, all twin pairs were treated as individuals and
the association between educational attainment and
continuous health outcomes/behaviours were investi-
gated using a generalized estimating equation (GEE)
model, which adjusts for the clustering of outcomes
within twin pairs. Individual covariates (age, gender,
race, working status and marital status) were also
adjusted. The number of depressive symptoms was
excluded from GEE analysis due to a high degree of
right skew. Details of individual covariates are pre-
sented in Table 1.
Secondly, the relationships between education and
health outcomes/behaviours were re-analysed by
using the fixed-effect model among twin pairs. See
Greene24 and Hsiao25 for a detailed description of
the statistical approach used in the fixed-effect
model, and Fujiwara et al.16 as an example. Briefly,
in the fixed-effect model, the effect of education on
health outcomes/behaviours was calculated by cancel-
ling the effect of unknown shared factors, such as
genetic or early family environmental influences,
that might affect health outcomes/behaviours. An
equation representing the association between health
and education for each pair of twins (let the first
subscript, i, represent the twin pair, and let the
second subscript represent either twin 1 or 2 in the
pair) can be written as follows:
yi1
¼ 11
xi1
þ gi1
þ fi
þ ei1
yi2
¼ 12
xi2
þ gi2
þ fi
þ ei2
,
where
y is health outcomes/behaviours,
x is the educational attainment,
g and f, respectively, represent unmeasured factors
such as genetic endowment g and early family envi-
ronment f and e represents a normal error term.
In the fixed-effect model, the effects of these
unmeasured factors (i.e. fixed effect) can be cancelled
by subtracting the equations as follows:
yi1
­ yi2
¼ '1
(xi1
­ xi2
)þ (gi1
­ gi2
) þ (fi
­ fi
) þ (ei1
­ ei2
),
which can be rewritten as
yi
Ã¼'1
xi
Ãþ gi
Ã þ fi
Ã þ ei
Ã, where the asterisk indi-
cates the difference of variables within each twin pair.
As early family environment is the same in both MZ
and DZ twins, fi
Ã is equal to zero. In MZ twins, the
genetic endowment is the same; hence, gi
Ã is equal to
zero. Therefore, if b'1
is different between MZ and
DZ pairs, the difference can be interpreted to be due
to the term gi
Ã.
In fixed-effect analysis, years of schooling and
health outcomes (perceived global, physical, mental
health, BMI, WC, WHR) were treated as continuous
variables. The number of depressive symptoms was
treated as an ordinal variable (due to a high degree
of right skew), and ordered logistic regression was
used. In terms of health behaviours, for smoking
(other than number of cigarettes per day), variables
were treated as binary in the fixed-effect models. The
number of cigarettes was also analysed among current
smokers as a continuous variable, to check the dose­
response effect of education on smoking. For physical
activity, first, responses were dichotomized into those
who responded `never' versus any physical activity.
Secondly, among those who responded doing any
physical activity, items were re-coded into average
monthly physical activity using the category mid-
points: `0.5' times per month, `1', `3', `4.5' and
`13.5'. Detailed analyses were performed to examine
the effects of schooling on different aspects of smok-
ing behaviour. In sensitivity analysis, education was
treated as a categorical variable (i.e. less than high

Results
Demographic characteristics including educational
attainment are shown in Table 1. Among males, the
mean years of schooling was 14.1 and the percentage
who graduated college or more was 31.3%, whereas
the percentage of those who did not graduate high
school was 8.8%. In females, the mean years of
schooling was 13.5, and 21.8% graduated college or
more and 11.1% did not graduate high school. The
majority of the sample was White, full-time workers
and married for both sexes.

and 25.7 for females, WC was 37.5 inches for
males and 32.9 for females, and WHR was 0.96 for
males and 0.83 for females. Men and women were
fairly comparable on the self-rated measures of
global health, physical health and mental health.
With regard to smoking habits, the majority of sub-
jects (70­80%) reported having smoked at least some
time in the past (ever smoker). The mean age at start-
ing to smoke regularly was 18.4 and 19.2 years,
respectively, for males and females. Among current
smokers, $77% reported attempts to quit smoking.
More than 50% of male twins reported doing vigorous
physical activity in the summer and winter at
least once a week. In females, 480% of female twins
reported doing moderate physical activity at least once
a week in the summer and winter. These percentages
were similar to the original MIDUS study, a national
representative sample (e.g. 79% of females do moder-
ate physical activity at least once a week in the
summer and winter).26
The individual-level associations between years of
schooling and health outcomes/behaviours adjusted
for covariates (race, working status and marital
status) as well as the within-twin pair correlation
are shown in Table 3. Among males, years of school-
ing were positively associated with perceived global,
physical and mental health, while BMI, WC and WHR
were not associated with schooling. Schooling was
protective against current smoking: each additional
year of schooling decreased the likelihood of being
current smoker by 25% [odds ratio (OR): 0.75, 95%
confidence interval (CI): 0.68­0.83]. However, school-
ing was not associated with the intensity of daily
smoking among current smokers. Moderate and
vigorous physical activity in both summer and
winter were positively associated with schooling
among males. In females, similar associations were
found as with males, but WC and WHR were nega-
tively associated with schooling [i.e. each additional
year of schooling reduced WC by 0.29 inches (95% CI:
À0.47 to 0.11)].
Table 4 shows the results of the fixed-effect analysis,
stratified by gender and zygosity. The point estimates
of the associations between schooling and perceived
physical and mental health were in a similar direction
to the GEE estimates. Similarly, the relationships
between schooling and anthropometric values (BMI,
WC and WHR) exhibited similar directions of associ-
ation (higher education ! leaner physique). Among
male twins, the main finding was an inverse associa-
tion between schooling and smoking status among DZ
twins (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.48­0.97). The point esti-
mate among MZ male twins also showed an inverse
association (OR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.31­1.15). Among
those who do moderate physical activity, a dose­
response relationship was found between schooling
and frequency of moderate physical activity. Among
female twins, the associations between education and
health outcomes were broadly in a similar direction as
the GEE results, except for smoking status where
years of schooling and smoking status were not asso-
ciated among female twins in the fixed-effect model.
To increase the power, sex-combined fixed-effect
analysis was performed (results shown in Table 5).
It is noteworthy to report that years of schooling
positively associated with perceived global health:
each additional year of schooling increased the
score of perceived global health (range 0­10) by 0.1

(95% CI: 0.0003­0.19). However, in DZ twins,
the same association was not found with the point
estimate showing an inverse association between
years of schooling and perceived global health.
Anthropometric outcomes suggested associations
between higher years of schooling and lower BMI
and WC among MZ pairs. Smoking status was not
associated with years of schooling in sex-combined
MZ and DZ twins.
Table 6 shows the association between schooling
and detailed smoking behaviours using the fixed-
effect model. Schooling was not associated with ever
smoking. Among DZ male twins, schooling reduced
the likelihood of being a current smoker (OR: 0.66,
95% CI: 0.45­0.96). However, the corresponding asso-
ciation was not observed in MZ male twins, although
the point estimate was similar. Among female MZ/DZ
twins, schooling was not associated with current
smoking status. The point estimate of quitting beha-
viour among regular smokers was positively asso-
ciated with schooling among male twins (MZ, OR:
5.76, 95% CI: 0.26­126.4; DZ, OR: 1.49, 95% CI:
0.87­2.53). Finally, education was not associated
with the initiation of regular smoking among non-
smokers who completed their schooling, although
the point estimate among female twins indicated an
inverse association between more years of schooling
and risk of initiating regular smoking. Trying to quit
smoking behaviour was not associated with the
schooling year among current smoker either.
Again, to increase the power, the corresponding ana-
lysis was performed using the sex-combined sample
(Table 7). In the combined DZ sample, schooling
reduced the initiation of regular smoking among
non-smokers who completed their schooling (OR:

among MZ twins was in a similar direction (OR:

twins, there was a suggestion of more years of school-
ing being associated with lower odds of current smok-
ing and higher odds of quitting.
In sensitivity analysis, education was treated as a
categorical variable. The results were essentially simi-
lar. Among male twins, there was a suggestion of an

did not graduate high school, ORs of smoking among
high school graduates was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.08­2.57),
0.37 (95% CI: 0.05­2.71) among those with some
college and 0.08 (95% CI: 0.01­0.91) among college
graduates. The point estimates of OR for overall
categorized education on smoking among MZ male
twins similarly indicated an inverse association
(OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.07­1.33). Due to lack of statisti-
cal power, we were unable to estimate ORs for high
school, some college and college or more graduates in
comparison with those who did not graduate high
school among MZ male twins. Among DZ male
twins, a dose­response relationship was suggested
between schooling and frequency of moderate physi-
cal activity (in summer, b: 1.47, 95% CI: 0.25­2.69; in
winter, b: 1.40, 95% CI: 0.16­2.63). Among female
twins, the associations between categorized education
health outcomes were in a similar direction to educa-
tion modelled as a linear variable (years of schooling).
In sex-combined analysis, education was associated
with better perceived global health: in comparison
with less than high school graduates, coefficient of
high school graduates was 1.03 (95% CI: 0.20­1.87),
some college was 1.27 (95% CI: 0.40­2.14) and college
or more was 1.50 (95% CI: 0.48­2.51).
Discussion
At the individual level, we replicated the previously
reported positive associations between schooling and
health outcomes/behaviours. Thus, higher educational
attainment was associated with better perceived
global, physical and mental health, more favourable
anthropometric measures, less smoking behaviour
and frequent physical activity. However, our twin
fixed-effect analyses yielded generally a weak associ-
ation between schooling and health across the range
of outcomes examined, though the point estimates
generally tended to suggest protective effects. Only
perceived global health was associated with years of
schooling among sex-combined MZ twins, although
the effect size is small (Cohen's d ¼ 0.11) and the
corresponding association was not found among DZ
twins. Regarding schooling and current smoking, we
found a protective association among male DZ twins,

IS EDUCATION CAUSALLY RELATED TO BETTER HEALTH? 1319
though not MZ twins. This suggests that the associa-
tion between schooling and smoking status may be
confounded by unobserved genetic factors.
Our findings were consistent with the middle-aged
Danish twin study.15 In their study, self-reported
health, BMI, depressive symptoms, smoking habits
and physical activity were not associated with educa-
tion after cancelling for genetic and early family envi-
ronmental factors. A previous study showed that the
association between education and smoking is stron-
ger than the association between occupation and
smoking.2 Gilman et al.27 showed robust associations
between lower educational attainment and smoking
patterns, although adjustment for family environment
(using a fixed-effect approach among siblings) failed
to confirm the association.27 A study of female twins
in Virginia also showed that both genetic and envi-
ronmental factors were associated with smoking ini-
tiation and nicotine dependence.28 It is possible that
there are health selection effects on the association
between education and health, i.e. poor health
during childhood, such as asthma or epilepsy, may
be prior common causes of both limited educational
achievement as well as poor health in adulthood.29,30
However, it is premature to conclude that education is
not causally associated with smoking. In our study,
although the fixed-effect model among MZ male
twins failed to show a strong association between
education and current smoking, the point estimate
was nonetheless 0.60, which is in the expected direc-
tion. The weak associations reported in our twin
fixed-effect analyses may be due to low statistical
power, rather than to the absence of a causal effect
of education on health outcomes.
In addition, our study showed an association
between education and dose of moderate physical
activity among male DZ twins, but not male MZ
twins, suggesting unmeasured genetic factors, but
not early family environment, may influence the asso-
ciation between education and moderate physical
activity among males. With regard to females, no
association was found between education and physi-
cal activity after cancelling genetic and early family
environmental factors, although a strong association
was found in the individual analysis. This suggests
that the associations between education and physical
activity in individual analysis were confounded by
genetic and early family environmental factors
among females. These findings are consistent with
previous findings suggesting stronger genetic influ-
ences on physical activity among males than
females.31
In summary, the current study showed possible
causal effects of education on perceived global
health and on smoking habits among males, but did
not suggest direct associations between schooling and
the other health outcomes studied. The repeatedly
observed association between education and health
may be at least partly confounded by genetic or
early family environmental factors.9 Nonetheless, our
study also suggested that education may be effective
in prevent smoking habits among men.
Our study has several limitations. First, the analyses
are cross-sectional, so that reverse causation cannot
be ruled out. However, educational attainment was
determined before 25 years of age, the youngest age
of our sample, so that poor health status (which most
people begin to succumb to at older ages) is less likely
to have affected educational attainment. The remain-
ing bias is health status during schooling, i.e. those
with major illnesses during childhood might have
completed fewer years of schooling, and also ended
up with lower levels of health in adulthood. Secondly,
the analyses assume that twins living together up to
aged 14 years shared the same family environment,
but living together in childhood does not necessary
mean that they shared the same `rearing' family
environment. Thus, for example, the inverse associa-
tion between schooling and smoking among male
twins might be explained by a difference in the rear-
ing environment between twins. Thirdly, BMI, WC
and WHR were reported by the respondents, not mea-
sured by the investigators. The null associations
between schooling and BMI, WC and WHR may be
due the reporting bias, as educational attainment
could affect self-reporting of health outcomes, thereby
diluting the true association between schooling and
health outcomes. Other risk factors for poor health,
for example, blood pressure or low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol level, were not measured. Fourthly, the
limited response percentage could have led to selec-
tion bias in this study. The educational level among
twins in this study was somewhat higher than that in
the original MIDUS study. It is also possible that
twins who were discordant on educational attainment
were less likely to participate in the twin study in
order to avoid comparisons with their opposite twin
pair. Such selection bias may have contributed to an
underestimation of the association between schooling
and health/health behaviours.
In conclusion, education was associated with health
outcomes in individual-level analysis, but in fixed-
effect analysis (i.e. adjusted for genetic and early
family environment), the associations were less
robust, even though the direction of the associations
was similar.
For specific health behaviours, such as current
smoking and frequency of moderate physical activity,
schooling appeared to be associated in the hypothe-
sized direction among males, though not in females.
Taken together, our twin fixed-effect analyses suggest
that at least some cases of the education/health rela-
tionship reflect confounding by unobserved third
variables.

KEY MESSAGES
 The association between education and health may be confounded by unobserved common prior
causes such as inherited ability, personality such as time preference, or early family circumstances.
 The twin fixed-effects approach can potentially address this problem by cancelling these factors
between twin pairs.
 The findings showed that among monozygotic twins, more years of schooling was associated with
better perceived global health.
 For health outcomes/behaviours, the point estimates of the effect of education suggested a weak
protective association.

Commentary: Strengths and limitations of
the discordant twin-pair design in social
epidemiology. Where do we go from here?

It has become increasingly recognized that many
of the associations between various exposures and
health outcomes measured in adulthood are con-
founded by social and behavioural factors acting
early in life,1 and recent research has questioned
whether socio-economic position (SEP) in adulthood
in fact has an additional impact on adult health
beyond the influence of one's childhood environment
and genetic make-up.2
The traditional way to examine the independent
influence of adult SEP on differences in health out-
comes is to use multivariable models, which mutually
adjust for early and late social factors. However, such
analyses may not provide sufficient adjustment for all
the factors that constitute childhood social environ-
ment, and close correlation between early and late
social factors may present serious statistical chal-
lenges. Alternative approaches for dealing with con-
founding are designs that approximate the conditions
of a true experiment. One such approach is the
discordant twin-pair design employed by Fujiwara
and Kawachi3 in their well-designed and innovative
study. Here, the authors compare health status in
twin pairs who are discordant on educational status
in adulthood, but are matched fully or partly on
genetic make-up and rearing environment. Such a
study on twin-pair discordant on exposure provides
a useful analogue to the idealized counterfactual
design, and failure to observe an association within
discordant twin pairs would imply that a previously
observed association between an exposure and an out-
come is attributable to common genetic or shared
environmental factors. In addition, differences in the
magnitude of association between monozygotic and
dizygotic twins may serve to further disentangle the
respective effects of genetic and familial environmen-
tal effects.
However, as enchanting as this approach may seem,
as with everything else, it has a price: in this case, the
flip side of the coin is the fact that the statistical
power in the fixed-effects analyses is dramatically
limited, resulting in highly imprecise estimates.
The implication of this is that these `unconfounded'
estimates may in fact be further away from the `true
value', which we are trying to estimate, due to the
large imprecision of estimates.4 A consequence of
this is that authors are left with considerable room
for interpretation of results and, in some cases, inter-
pretation tends to border on arbitrariness. To illustrate
this point, we would like to call attention to a discus-
sion paper by Lundborg,5 which essentially is based
on the same data (MIDUS survey, first data collection
wave) as the paper by Fujiwara and Kawachi,
although dizygotic same-sex twin pairs were not
included. Despite the fact that the results in the
two papers appear to be fairly similar, the authors
