Introduction
For most cancer patients, the most common side effects of
both the underlying disease and its oncological treatment
are pain, depression, and fatigue.1 Cancer-related fatigue
(CRF) is defined as "a common, persistent, and subjective
sense of tiredness related to cancer or to treatment of cancer
that interferes with usual functioning."2 CRF differs from
so-called "everyday life" fatigue, which is generally tempo-
rary and can be relieved by rest or sleep. The impact of CRF
on a patient's ability to function in daily life is considerable,
and it has been found to adversely affect patients' quality of
life (QOL) even more than pain.3-8 Fatigue is reported in
40% to 75% of cancer patients. The prevalence of CRF
increases to 60% to 93% in patients receiving external beam
radiation therapy (RT),3-5 and when Visual Analogue
Fatigue Scales were used, the percentage rose to 99%.9
Furthermore, a significant number of cancer patients suffer-
ing from fatigue receive inadequate treatment for their
symptoms.1 The National Comprehensive Cancer Network
guidelines recommend that integrative nonpharmacological
interventions be implemented for managing CRF. Various
studies have demonstrated a positive effect from physical
activity interventions during and after cancer treatment.
These studies also showed that exercise is safe and well tol-
erated by patients during various cancer treatments, includ-
ing RT.1,9-12
Of the estimated 233 000 men who will be diagnosed
with prostate cancer (PC) in 2014,13 at least one-third are
expected to undergo definitive RT at some point in their
lifetimes. In addition to CRF, PC patients typically report
high levels of urinary and sexual adverse effects before,
during, and after treatment, with more than half of the
patients reporting poor sexual drive.14 Erectile dysfunction
(ED) is defined by the National Institute of Health as "the
inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for
satisfactory sexual performance."15(p. 83) ED is reported in
21% to 85% of PC patients.16-19 The etiology of ED after
prostate RT is still poorly understood, with

Abstract
Purpose. Studies have demonstrated beneficial health effects from yoga interventions in cancer patients, but predominantly
in breast cancer. Research on its role in alleviating prostate cancer (PC) patients' side effects has been lacking. Our primary
goal was to determine the feasibility of recruiting PC patients on a clinical trial of yoga while they underwent external beam
radiation therapy (RT). Methods. Twice-weekly yoga interventions were offered throughout the RT course (6-9 weeks).
Baseline demographic information was collected. Feasibility was declared if 15 of the first 75 eligible PC patients approached
(20%) were successfully accrued and completed the intervention. Additional end points included standardized assessments
of fatigue, erectile dysfunction (ED), urinary incontinence (UI), and quality of life (QOL) at time points before, during, and
after RT. Results. Between May 2013 and June 2014, 68 eligible PC patients were identified. 23 patients (34%) declined,
and 45 (56%) consented to the study. 18 (40%) were voluntarily withdrawn due to treatment conflicts. Of the remaining
27, 12 (30%) participated in 50% of classes, and 15 (59%) were evaluable. Severity of fatigue scores demonstrated
significant variability, with fatigue increasing by week 4, but then improving over the course of treatment (P = .008). ED,
UI, and general QOL scores demonstrated reassuringly stable, albeit not significant trends. Conclusions. A structured yoga
intervention of twice-weekly classes is feasible for PC patients during a 6- to 9-week course of outpatient radiotherapy.
Preliminary results are promising, showing stable measurements in fatigue, sexual health, UI, and general QOL.

studies demonstrating vascular disease and hemodynamic
interference, nerve damage, and or damage to the proximal
penile structures.16,18 Urinary incontinence (UI) is a broad
term for loss of bladder control from any etiology, with the
most common type being stress incontinence caused by loss
of outlet resistance at the bladder neck. Urge UI occurs
when the bladder detrusor contracts involuntarily during
bladder filling and is the more common type of inconti-
nence seen with RT. The prevalence of UI after RT is 24%
and may be acute or take years to develop.14,16 The popular-
ity of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has
been growing rapidly in the general population, with an
estimated 70% of Americans currently using some CAM
modality.20 Among cancer patients, the prevalence of CAM
use has increased nearly 3-fold in the past two decades.21-23
The majority of cancer patients use some form of CAM,
hoping to boost immunity, relieve pain, and/or control can-
cer- and cancer treatment­related morbidity.24 The National
Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine
(NCCAM) defines CAM as "a group of diverse medical and
health care systems, practices and products that are not
presently considered to be part of conventional medicine"
(http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/). Yoga is a physi-
cal, mental, and spiritual CAM practice aimed to bring body
and mind together. Historically, most research on yoga as a
therapeutic modality has been performed in women, and
specifically breast cancer patients.25-28 In contrast, research
on the use of yoga as a modality for alleviating PC patients'
side effects has been limited.29 Regarding sexual dysfunc-
tion and yoga, there are a few published reports in women,
but to our knowledge, there are no data on the direct effects
of yoga on ED. That said, as one of several mind-body prac-
tices, yoga has been demonstrated to elicit a relaxation
response characterized by decreased oxygen consumption,
increased levels of exhaled nitric oxide (NO), and reduced
stress.30 NO is known to play a prominent role in vascular
dilation, which affects blood pressure.31 We hypothesize
that improving pelvic blood circulation as a result of an
increase in circulation blood NO levels may improve ED,
although this hypothesis would need to be specifically and
prospectively tested with biometric and QOL correlations.
With respect to UI, there is some evidence that yoga in com-
bination with pelvic exercise can help reduce this symptom
in women. We hypothesized that strengthening of the pelvic
floor muscles may reduce UI in PC patients.32,33 The main
goal of our study was to evaluate the feasibility of using
yoga as a complementary treatment modality in PC patients.
We specifically sought to (1) determine if PC patients
undergoing a 6- to 9-week course of outpatient RT as defini-
tive or postoperative treatment would consent to participate
in the study and comply with attendance of an intensive
twice-weekly yoga regimen and (2) study the effect of yoga
on fatigue, ED, UI, and general QOL during cancer
therapy.
Methods
Participants
Adult men with biopsy-proven PC who consented to undergo
a 6- to 9-week course of external beam RT at the University
of Pennsylvania were recruited between May 2013 and June
2014. Prospective participants were assessed for eligibility
on or before the day of radiation treatment planning (simula-
tion). Patients were prescreened with PAR-Q/PAR-MED-X34
for barriers to participation in physical activity and deemed
eligible to participate when they met the following criteria:
minimum age of 18 years, biopsy-proven diagnosis of clini-
cal (intact) or pathological (postprostatectomy) stage I or II
PC, suitable for a 6- to 9-week course of outpatient RT for
PC, and English speaking. Patients were excluded if they,
according to their physicians, had medical restrictions that
could interfere with or preclude participation in the yoga
interventions, were active smokers (former smokers who
had been smoke free for the past 6 months or more could be
included), currently participated in a yoga practice (any
yoga classes on a regular basis within the past 6 months), or
had clinical evidence of metastatic disease.
Intervention
Eischens yoga, an integrative style of yoga rooted in the Iyengar
practice, is focused more on the energy of the poses rather than
the complexity and, thus, is more readily accessible for all body
types and experience levels. The hands-on feedback technique
helps instructors to continually guide the students, to help them
engage the weaker muscles in the body, and to actively improve
alignment. This is believed to result in better posture and allow
for improved flexibility, greater self-awareness, higher pain tol-
erance, and increased strength and energy.
Eischens yoga classes were held on several days during
the work week (typically late morning and late afternoon) at
theAbramson Cancer Center. Each class was led by a trained
Eischens yoga instructor, had between 4 and 8 participants,
and lasted 75 minutes. A typical session included seated
(using a chair), standing, and reclining poses (Table 1). Yoga
poses were modified and included the use of props to facili-
tate and adapt the poses for each participant's specific needs
and restrictions. Each session began with breathing and cen-
tering techniques as well as an inventory of energy and stress
levels.
There were 3 trained teachers available for this pilot
study, but 77% of all classes were taught by the lead teacher
and study first author, who is a certified Eischens yoga
teacher. The remaining 23% of the classes were taught by 2
certified yoga teachers who were trained by the lead teacher
in the details of the specific poses to be used for the study
participants. Both assistant teachers also had prior experi-
ence working with cancer patients.

Assessments
PAR-Q/PAR-MED-X forms were used to assess patients' eli-
gibility to participate in physical activity; these forms are
derived from a 2007 collaboration of international authorities
and regional health and fitness organizations seeking to reduce
barriers for low- to moderate-intensity physical activity par-
ticipation and to improve identification of individuals who
may require additional screening prior to becoming more
physically active. Background and demographic information
were collected at the initial meeting, including age, race/eth-
nicity, marital/partner status, educational history, income,
residence location, travel time to facility, method of travel,
details regarding comorbidities, disease stage, and details of
current radiotherapy.
Fatigue was assessed using the Brief Fatigue Inventory
(BFI) questionnaire, a 9-item scale that rapidly assesses
fatigue severity. The first 3 questions rate the severity of the
patient's fatigue at its "worst," "usual," and "now" over the
past 24 hours, with 0 indicating "no fatigue" and 10 indicat-
ing "fatigue as bad as you can imagine." Six questions assess
the amount that fatigue has interfered with different aspects
of the patient's life during the past 24 hours. The interfer-
ence items include general activity, mode, walking ability,
normal work (includes both work outside the home and
housework), relations with others, and enjoyment of life.
The interference items are measured on a 0 to 10 scale, with
0 being does not interfere and 10 being completely inter-
feres. Scores are simple sums of the items in each subscale.
General QOL was assessed using the FACT-G (Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy­General), a 27-item validated
instrument measuring symptoms or problems associated with
malignancies across 4 scales: physical well-being (7 items);
social/family well-being (7 items); emotional well-being (6
items); and functional well-being (7 items). Patients rate all
items using a 5-point rating scale ranging from not at all to very
much. The measure yields information about total QOL as well
as information about the dimensions of physical well-being and
disease-specific concerns. FACT-G takes about 5 minutes to
complete and has been written at the sixth grade level.
TheInternationalIndexofErectileFunctionQuestionnaire
(IIEF-5), also referred to as the Sexual Health inventory for
Men, was used to assess ED. Scores range from 0 to 25, with
scores >21 indicating normal erectile function and scores
<12 indicating moderate to severe ED. The International
Prostate Symptom Score Sheet (IPSS) was used to deter-
mine the severity of urinary symptoms. Scores on this scale
range from 0 to 35, where a score of 8 to 19 indicates mod-
erately symptomatic and 20 to 35, severely symptomatic.
The final question on this scale addresses urinary QOL and
is assigned a score of 1 to 6, where 6 is terrible.
BFI forms were completed by patients at the following
time points:
1. within2to3weekspriortostartofradiotherapy--thatis,
on the day of consultation or on the day of simulation;
2. biweekly while receiving radiotherapy; and
3. within a week of the last yoga class or at the end of
the EBRT course.
FACT-G, IIEF-5, and IPSS forms were completed by
patients at the following time points:
1. within2to3weekspriortostartofradiotherapy--thatis,
on the day of consultation or on the day of simulation;
2. in the fourth week of radiotherapy (when treatment-
related symptoms are expected to peak); and
3. within a week of the last yoga class or at the end of
the EBRT course.
Statistical Considerations
This present study was designed as a single-arm longitudinal
pilot study of QOL measures, with a sample of 15 participants
for feasibility, to be followed by a larger randomized study. We
specifically aimed to achieve this goal of 15 out of the first 75
patients approached because this represented an evaluable
patient rate of 20%. We hoped to detect 80% participation in
the study intervention, defined as twice-weekly yoga class
attendance throughout the entire radiation course.An observed
80% participation in 15 patients gave us 80% power to reject
50% or less participation using a 1-sided test at  = .05.
Analyses were conducted using Stata v13 (Stata Corporation,
College Station,TX.). Secondary analyses examined the trends
over time for QOL measures. Cross-tabulation and summary
statistics were used to make illustrations. We determined

Results
The main goal of this feasibility study was to evaluate the
willingness of patients with PC to participate in a structured
twice-weekly yoga regimen concurrent with active cancer
therapy. A total of 68 eligible PC patients were approached
regarding this study after they agreed (but before they
started) to undergo a course of therapeutic external beam
radiation. Patient demographics are summarized in Table 2.
Of the 68 patients approached, 23 (34%) declined to partici-
pate in the study. The most common reasons provided for
declining participation were lack of time and incompatibil-
ity with work schedules, rather than a lack of interest or
"belief" in yoga. Of the 45 remaining patients who con-
sented to the study, 18 (40%) were withdrawn from the
study early voluntarily by the principal investigator because
of insufficient class attendance. The most common cause
cited for inadequate class attendance was an unavoidable
and unanticipated conflict between the radiation treatment
time and the yoga class schedule (15 of the 18; 83%). Of the
remaining 27 patients, 12 (30%) patients participated in
50% or more of the classes, and 15 (59%) finished the
required number of yoga classes and were ultimately

deemed evaluable by the clinical protocol criteria. The suc-
cessful completion of the study by 15 patients out of the
first 68 approached met our predefined protocol definition
of a feasible intervention, and thus, feasibility was declared.
We have summarized the data across all time points in
Figure 1. The measures were highly correlated within subject.
BFI scales were correlated among time points, with  ranging
from 0.6 to 0.7. FACT scales were slightly lower, ranging from
0.34 to 0.81. IPSS, QOL, and IIEF-5 gave  values of 0.87,
0.84, and 0.78, respectively. The measures were also correlated
with each other, averaging 0.41 among measures.
Fatigue
Figure 1 shows all 3 measures of fatigue (BFI­severity, BFI­
impact and BFI­global). The global fatigue scores (Figure 1)
show a slight downward trend in the graph, with fatigue scores
staying in the low to midrange levels, but the model was not
significant (P = .16). When looking at the impact of fatigue on
daily life (Figure 1), variation was also nonsignificant (P = .7).
Nevertheless, the severity of fatigue scores demonstrate a sig-
nificant variability over time over the course of treatment (P =
.008; Figure 1). Scores declined over the first 3 weeks but
returned to their prior levels by weeks 6 and 8.
Function and Quality of Life
Sexual health scores (IIEF-5) fell slightly over the course of
treatment, but the variation among time points was not sig-
nificant. The IPSS increased sharply over the course of treat-
ment (P < .0001), with significant differences from baseline
at 4 and 12 weeks. QOL scores associated with urinary
symptoms increased over the course of treatment (P = .005),
with significant changes at weeks 4 and 8. Functional, physi-
cal, and social well-being parameters showed no significant
changes from baseline. Emotional well-being increased
from baseline to 4 weeks and 12 weeks (P < .001).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first published pilot study dem-
onstrating the feasibility of an intensive yoga intervention for
patients with PC undergoing outpatient radiotherapy. Two-
thirds of the men approached were initially very enthusiastic
and willing to take part in the yoga program. However, almost
entirely because of conflicts between the radiation treatment
times and the available yoga class schedule, one-third of the
patients who started the program were unable to attend the
requisite minimum number of yoga classes. Resource

limitations in terms of staffing and room availability restricted
the number and timing of yoga classes offered. Radiation
treatment machine malfunction leading to unpredictable
delays, severe inclement weather, and long travel time to and
from the hospital were among the main issues that prevented
enrolled patients from attending the twice-weekly classes
offered at the hospital. But even despite these issues, the study
met our stringent definition of feasibility in this pilot study, in
which we mandated a 20% rate of evaluable patients. Typical
clinical trial enrollment rates among cancer patients have his-
torically been reported to be as low as 3%36; our rate of enroll-
ment was a surprising 66%, despite the prevailing perception
that "old men don't do yoga." According to a published
national survey of yoga practitioners, we estimate that a little
less than 7% of the adult yoga practitioner population com-
prises men older than 44 years.37-39 Even after removing the
study patients who had to be withdrawn early for noncompli-
ance, our rate of enrollment of eligible patients was nearly
40%. Furthermore, we found that all the selected Eischens
yoga poses were well tolerated by this patient population and
were approached with good will and, at times, a good sense of
humor. Most yoga participants reported a sense of well-being at
the end of each class; on finishing the yoga program and con-
cluding their involvement in the study, many patients requested
and received an at-home practice routine to fit their needs.
Thus far, we have also observed the potential for improve-
ment of CRF with this yoga intervention for PC patients
undergoing active radiation treatment. The levels of fatigue
that are normally expected to increase midtreatment (weeks
4 to 5) stayed unchanged, and the severity of the fatigue--
the ability to lead normal work and social lives--went to
pretreatment levels. These results are consistent with early
studies that demonstrated the ability of yoga interventions to
reduce fatigue symptoms in breast cancer survivors.27
Albeit from nonrandomized data, our findings demon-
strate a potential positive signal for improvement in urinary
symptoms in patients undergoing radiation treatment for PC.
Although the severity of the urinary symptoms expectedly
increased during the course of RT, the QOL associated with
urinary symptoms stayed unchanged, with lower scores at
the range of "pleased to mostly satisfied." Regarding male
sexual health, with the exception of 1 patient who reported
no ED, most patients had mild-moderate (IIEF-5 12-16) or
moderate (IIEF-5 8-11) ED. At present, we can only report
stability in sexual function among those participating in the
yoga intervention during radiation treatment. Further fol-
low-up and comparison with non-yoga-participating con-
trols are necessary. Overall, QOL parameters were
maintained throughout the treatment, with the exception of a
statistically significant decline in emotional well-being. This
initial decline (weeks 1 to 4) stabilized with the continuation
of the yoga sessions. Because most patients reported a sense
of well-being at the end of each class, one hypothesis is that
the emotional burden of daily radiation treatments was
harder to overcome during the first half of radiation
treatment, but its negative effect decreased, and emotional
well-being stabilized as patients became increasingly profi-
cient with their yoga practice.
There are several limitations to the present study. The
small sample size of this pilot study and lack of a control arm
negates the ability to exclude an argument that the findings
were caused by a placebo effect. Furthermore, this study was
not designed to follow the participants' sustainability with
any structured yoga practice and subsequently measure the
long-term effects (over a period of 1 to 3 years) of RT on ED
and UI and, thus, QOL. Finally, attention and social support
from other group members and/or instructors may have
biased the treatment effect and may have added to the overall
mental and emotional well-being of the participants.
Fortunately, because our pilot feasibility criteria have
been met, this study has continued seamlessly to a random-
ized phase II design. Future analysis of data from the full
complement of yoga and non­yoga participants in the ran-
domized phase of the study will permit more detailed evalu-
ation of the impact of a yoga intervention on fatigue, UI,
ED, and overall QOL. Until then, our study does strongly
suggest that PC patients, a population perhaps not tradition-
ally believed to have great interest in integrative and com-
plementary therapies because of stereotypes of age and
gender, may in fact prove to be a viable and attractive audi-
ence for such targeted interventions.At a minimum, the pre-
liminary work presented here underscores the fact that PC
patients have a clinically and emotionally significant need
for symptomatic management of fatigue and pelvic floor
compromise during cancer therapy and that nonmedical
approaches should be considered in this setting.
