Objectives: To examine the association between perceived overweight status and weight control, discrepancies between
perceived and measured weight status, and opportunities for health care professionals (HCPs) to correct weight perception
among US adults.
Design: Population-based cross-sectional study.
Subjects: In all, 16 720 non-pregnant adults from the 2003 to 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
Results: Overall, 64% (73% women, 55% men) reported a desire to weigh less and 48% (57% women, 40% men) reported
pursuing weight control. Weight control was positively associated with overweight perception (odds ratio (OR) women 3.74;
95% confidence interval (CI) 2.96, 4.73; OR men 2.82; 95% CI 2.11, 3.76) and an HCP diagnosis of overweight/obesity (OR
women 2.22; 95% CI 1.69, 2.91; OR men 2.14; 95% CI 1.58, 2.91), independent of measured weight status. A large proportion
of overweight individuals (23% women, 48% men) perceived themselves as having the right weight. Also, 74% of overweight
and 29% of obese individuals never had an HCP diagnosis of overweight/obesity. Although the majority of overweight/obese
individuals (74% women, 60% men) pursued at least one weight management strategy, fewer (39% women, 32% men)
pursued both dietary change and physical activity. Among overweight/obese adults, those with an HCP diagnosis of
overweight/obesity were more likely to diet (74 versus 52%), exercise (44 versus 34%), or pursue both (41 versus 30%, all
Po0.01) than those who remained undiagnosed.
Conclusion: HCPs have unused opportunities to motivate their patients to control and possibly lose weight by correcting weight
perceptions and offering counseling on healthy weight loss strategies.

Introduction
Obesity increases risk of diabetes, coronary artery disease,
stroke, cancer, premature death and contributes substan-
tially to societal costs.1­3 As little as a 5% of weight reduction
in overweight or obese individuals can decrease the risk of
cardiovascular events.4 However, sustained weight loss has
been difficult to achieve in clinical trials,5,6 and more so
outside trial settings.7
Lack of motivation is an important barrier to successful
weight loss and maintenance.2 Perceived weight status,
rather than measured weight status, may be an important
determinant of motivation to lose weight.8­12 However, little
is known about how the discrepancy between perceived and
measured weight status affects adoption of weight control
behaviors. Health care professionals (HCPs) may increase
the motivation of a patient by correcting weight perception
and through supportive counseling.13,14 However, whether
an HCP diagnosis of overweight/obesity influences the
adoption of weight management strategies is not known.
Also, the role of HCPs in correcting weight perception and
influencing attitudes and behaviors toward weight loss is
less studied.
We used nationally representative data to examine the
following: (1) the association between perceived overweight

perceived and measured weight status and (3) opportunities
for HCPs to correct weight perception among US adults.
Subjects and methods
Study population
We examined data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative
complex, multistage probability sample of the US civilian,
non-institutionalized population conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics.15­17 To produce estimates with
statistical reliability, we combined three 2-year cycles
of the continuous NHANES 2003­2004, 2005­2006 and
2007­2008.18 Unless otherwise noted, survey questions
and methods were consistent in all three waves. NHANES
2003­2008 oversampled lower income persons, adolescents
12­19 years, persons 60 þ years of age, African­Americans
and Mexican­Americans.15­17 Beginning 2007, the entire
Hispanic population was oversampled.17 Participants were
interviewed in their homes and underwent a standardized
physical examination in a mobile examination center.
The survey protocol was approved by the National Centers
for Health Statistics Ethics Review Board, and each partici-
pant provided written informed consent. Full details of
the NHANES are available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
nhanes.htm.
Response variables
Trained interviewers questioned participants about their
weight control using a computer-assisted personal interview-
ing system. The first outcome of interest was the dichot-
omous variable desire to weigh less. Participants were asked,
`Would you like to weigh more, less, or stay about the same?'
We created a dichotomous variable to identify participants
who desired to weigh less by combining participants who
desired to weigh more or stay about the same. The second
outcome of interest was the dichotomous variable pursuit of
weight control, defined as either trying to lose weight
or doing anything to keep from gaining weight during the
past 12 months. Participants who were categorized as
pursuing weight control and were further asked to report
all of the ways they tried to lose weight or keep from gaining
weight. We categorized these weight control strategies as (1)
dietary changes, (2) physical activity or (3) other.
Explanatory variables
We considered as covariates factors that could potentially
influence weight management behavior: gender, race/ethni-
city, age, measured body mass index (BMI) and waist
circumference (WC) categories, perceived weight status and
self-report of having a diagnosis of overweight/obese status,
diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, myocardial infarction and
hypertension by an HCP. During the physical examination,
participant weight and height were measured using
standardized procedures. BMI was calculated as measured
weight in kilograms divided by measured height in meters
squared, and classified as o18.5 kg mÀ2 underweight, 18.5
to o25 kg mÀ2 normal, 25 to o30 kg mÀ2 overweight,
X30 kg mÀ2 obese.19 WC was categorized as high risk for
men with measured WC 4102 cm and women with
measured WC 488 cm and low risk otherwise.19 Participants
were asked about their perceived weight status using the
question, `Do you consider yourself now to be overweight,
underweight, or about the right weight?' Participants
reported a diagnosis of overweight/obese status, diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, myocardial infarction or hyperten-
sion by an HCP.
Statistical analysis
We limited the study sample to non-pregnant adults age
18 years or older. Pregnancy was determined either by
participant report of pregnancy or a positive urine test. All
analyses used appropriate weights for 6 years of data from
2003­2008 to account for the complex sampling design
using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA),
unless otherwise noted.
First, we examined the prevalence of overweight and
obesity and the demographics of the study population. Next,
we examined the prevalence of desire to weigh less and
pursuit of weight control overall and by population
subgroups. Results for men and women were reported
separately to highlight possible differences in weight control
attempts and perceived weight status. Prevalence estimates
and standard errors were calculated using Proc Surveyfreq.
We compared perceived body weight status (underweight,
the right weight and overweight self-perception) with
measured BMI and WC categories. The prevalence of
individuals who have been diagnosed as overweight/obese
was calculated in the sub-population of those who had
reported seeing an HCP within the past 12 months.
The associations between desire to weigh less, pursuit of
weight control and perceived weight status were examined
using multivariable logistic regression. In these models,
which were stratified by sex, we simultaneously controlled
for age, race/ethnicity, measured BMI category and HCP
diagnosis of overweight/obesity, diabetes, high blood cho-
lesterol, heart attack and high blood pressure. Odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated
using Proc Surveylogistic.
Finally, we examined weight control practices in the
subgroup of overweight or obese adults who reported having
seen an HCP in the past year. Collection of weight control
practices data were consistent only in the 2005­2006
and 2007­2008 waves of the survey. For this analysis only,
we used appropriate weights for 4 years of data from
2005­2008 to account for the complex sampling design.

control strategies were reported overall and by HCP diag-
nosis of overweight/obese status.
Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate whether
the observed associations in the multivariable logistic
models were sensitive to including education level and
annual family income, or replacing BMI category with
WC category (to avoid collinearity), but no substantial
differences were found.
Results
The study analysis included 16 720 non-pregnant adults age
18 years and older. All analyses used sampling weights
to obtain prevalence estimates for US adults. About half
(51%) were female and 30% were age 55 years or older.
Approximately one-third of US adults were overweight
(27.6% women, 39.4% men) and one-third were obese
(34.1% women, 31.3% men).
A large proportion of US adults, 64.3%, reported having a
desire to lose weight. There was a higher prevalence of desire
to lose weight among women than men (73.2% women,
55.1% men, Table 1). A desire to weigh less was reported by
the majority of those who perceived themselves as over-
weight (98.3% women, 95.2% men) and those who received
an HCP diagnosis of overweight/obesity (93.9% women,
91.4% men). The prevalence of desire to weigh less was
higher among non-Hispanic whites than other racial/ethnic
groups. Approximately one half (48.2%) of normal weight
women desired to weigh less. Among men, the prevalence
of desire to weigh less was higher in the all subgroups
with an HCP diagnosis of a comorbidity than those without
a diagnosis. However, among women, those with an HCP
diagnosis of heart attack had a lower prevalence of desire to
weigh less.
Even though 64.3% of US adults desired to weigh less, a
lower proportion reported pursuing weight control (48.4%
overall, 57.1% women, 39.6% men, Table 2), and an even
lower proportion reported trying to lose weight (37.0%
overall, 46.2% women, 27.6% men). Similar to the gender
pattern for desire to lose weight, a greater proportion of
women reported pursuing weight control than men. Large
proportions of US adults with an HCP diagnosis of over-
weight/obesity (75.1% women, 65.0% men) and those who
perceived themselves as overweight (71.6% women, 59.6%
men) pursued weight control. The prevalence of pursuit of
weight control was greater among younger (o55 years) than
older (X55 years) women, but was similar between older and
younger men. Although prevalence of desire to weigh less
increased with BMI category, the prevalence of pursuit of
weight control did not increase as substantially among
higher BMI categories. Less than half of men and women in
the normal weight BMI category or low-risk WC category
reported pursuing weigh control. Similarly, less than half of
men with a diagnosis of high blood pressure, diabetes or
heart attack pursued weight control.
Discrepancies exist between measured and perceived
weight category among overweight men and women
(Table 3). Almost one half (48.1%) of overweight men
perceived themselves as having the right weight. One in
eight (13.0%) obese men perceived that they had the right
weight and almost one in five (17.9%) normal weight men
perceived themselves as underweight. Conversely, one
quarter (23.4%) of normal weight women perceived them-
selves as overweight. The sex differences in the validity of
perceived body weight decreased when using WC categories,
rather than BMI categories for measured weight categories.
Approximately one in six men and women with high-risk
WCs incorrectly perceive themselves to have about the
right weight. One-third (32.3%) of low-risk women and
one-fourth of low-risk (25.5%) men perceive themselves to
be overweight.

Weight control among US adults
S Yaemsiri et al
1065
International Journal of Obesity
Overweight self-perception was the most important pre-
dictor of desire to weigh less and pursuit of weight control
(Table 4). Women with overweight self-perception had
67 times higher odds (OR 66.85; 95% CI 46.69, 95.72) and
men with overweight self-perception had 32 times higher
odds (OR 32.41; 95% CI 22.62, 46.43) of desire to weigh less
compared with those who perceived themselves as having
the right weight. A positive association was observed
between overweight self-perception and pursuit of weight
control with an OR 3.74 (95% CI 2.96, 4.73) among women
and an OR 2.82 (95% CI 2.11, 3.76) among men. Both desire
to weigh less and pursuit of weight control were associated
positively with an HCP diagnosis of overweight/obesity and
high blood cholesterol independent of weight category in
men and women. Increasing age was inversely associated
with desire to weigh less and pursuit of weight control
in both men and women.
Interestingly, a large proportion of overweight/obese
individuals were never diagnosed as overweight/obese
by an HCP. Among individuals in the overweight BMI
category, 69% of women and 78% of overweight men were
never diagnosed as overweight/obese by an HCP (Table 3).
Importantly, 27% of obese women and 31% of obese men
remain undiagnosed as overweight/obese. Almost half of
those in the high-risk WC category were never told they were
overweight by an HCP.
Although the majority of overweight or obese adults
pursued at least one weight management activity (73.5%
women, 60.3% men, Table 5), fewer pursued both diet and
physical activity (38.6% women, 32.3% men). Overweight or
obese individuals who were diagnosed as overweight/obese
by an HCP had a higher prevalence of pursuing weight
control than those without a diagnosis. Similarly, among
overweight men and women, those diagnosed as over-
weight/obese by an HCP were more likely to diet, exercise
or pursue both. However, about 18% of women and 26% of
men made aware of their overweight status by an HCP did
not use any weight control strategies.
Discussion
In a recent nationally representative survey, three in five US
adults desired to weigh less and one in two pursued weight
control. We observed substantial discrepancies between
measured and perceived weight status, particularly among
males and those in the overweight BMI category. Overweight
perception and HCP diagnosis of overweight/obesity were
positively associated with desire to lose weight and pursuit of
weight control, independent of measured weight status.
Among overweight or obese individuals, those diagnosed
as overweight/obese by an HCP were more likely to make
dietary changes, exercise, or pursue both. However, the
majority of overweight individuals were never made aware of
their overweight status by an HCP.
The prevalence of obesity increased from 22.9 to 30.5%
between 1988 and 2000, but since then recent data suggests
that the rate of increase has stabilized.20 The prevalence of
pursuit of weight control follows the obesity trend through
the mid-1990s. Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System, the prevalence of attempted weight loss
now was 40 and 23% in the 1989 and 44 and 29% in the
1996 among women and men, respectively.21 Serdula et al.
attributed this increasing trend to the increasing prevalence
of obesity in the population. The prevalence of trying to lose
weight was 50 and 29% in NHANES III, 1998­1994,22 as
compared with 46 and 28% in our report of NHANES 2003­
2008 for women and men, respectively. Although the
prevalence of obesity continued to increase slightly over
this time period, it seems the prevalence of desire to weigh
less may have stabilized among men and decreased among
women.

Weight control among US adults

Increasing discrepancies in the perception of weight
status may explain the diverging trends in trying to lose
weight and obesity. Among overweight US adults, 11%
of women and 33% of men in 1998­1994, and 23% of
women and 48% of men in 2003­2008 believed they were
about the right weight.23 These results suggest that that
misperceptions of weight status may be increasing. The high
prevalence of overweight and obesity in the US may make
the condition appear `normal' as evident by an upward shift
in desired weight among Americans.24­26 One study of
weight perception in Great Britain also reported a marked
decline in sensitivity in an individual's overweight status.27

Weight misperception occurred predominately among men.
Gender differences in body image may explain this observa-
tion. On average, men tend to over-report their weight,
expressing a desire to report a higher body mass.28 Among
women, societal pressures, such as advertisement and mass
media, and cultural norms may contribute to pushing
misperception of body weight in the opposite direction as
that of men. Of note, use of BMI categories as the `gold
standard' with which to compare weight perception may
contribute to the idea that weight misperception occurs
predominately among men.29 BMI standardizes body weight
according to height, but does not distinguish between lean
and fat tissues or provide information on body fat
patterning. Individuals with high muscle mass, particularly
men, may be misclassified as overweight using BMI
categories.30 In contrast to BMI, WC has sex-specific cut
points and is a measure of visceral adiposity. Both the gender
differences and misperceptions were less pronounced in
our examination of weight perception with respect to
WC categories than with respect to BMI categories.
Still, approximately one in six men and women with
high-risk WC's perceived themselves to have the right
weight. Body weight dissatisfaction is associated with greater
intentions to change weight, physical activity or diet.24
Incorrect perception of weight status is of concern, as our
results support the mounting evidence that indicates
overweight self-perception is an important predictor of
pursuit of weight control.9,21,31
Positive associations between overweight self-perception
and pursuit of weight control have been previously reported
in studies with some limitations.8,11,32,33 Several were unable
to examine the association independent of measured weight
status. In the 1996 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System, trying to lose weight was most strongly associated
with self-reported BMI category (men: OR 7.56; 95% CI 7.01,
8.15; women: OR 5.18; 95% CI 6.60, 7.82), but investigators
did not examine the association independent of measured
weight status.21 Data from the 2004 Porter Novelli Health-
Styles and ConsumerStyles survey supported the association
between overweight self-perception and weight control.9
Overweight adults (categorized using self-reported BMI),
who disagreed their body weight was a health risk had
decreased odds of trying to lose weight (OR men 0.52; 95%
CI 0.29, 0.93; OR women 0.45; 95% CI 0.24, 0.84). Although
this report was unable to control for measured weight status,
it did suggest that perceived weight status was an important
predictor of trying to lose weight independent of self-
reported BMI. The Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study was
able to control for measured BMI. Investigators reported
increased odds of intending to change physical condition
and diet among men and women who had body dissatisfac-
tion in all measured BMI categories.24 However, this study
was conducted in a predominately white, middle-to-upper
class cohort that may not be generalizable to the US
population. Overall, these studies contribute to the growing
literature on the positive association between overweight
self-perception and pursuit of weight control and emphasize
the need to correct weight perception. The positive associa-
tion between having a diagnosis of high blood cholesterol
and pursuit of weight control may be due to the clearly
recommended lifestyle changes, including weight loss in
overweight patients, for the treatment of high blood
cholesterol.34
Opportunities to educate patients about weight mainte-
nance in clinical settings remain insufficiently used.35
Despite an increasing prevalence of obesity, the proportion
of obese individuals who received advice to lose weight
decreased from 44% in 1994 to 40% in 2000.36 HCPs face
many barriers to providing weight maintenance counseling,
including a focus on treating acute illnesses rather than
providing preventive care, lack of time and inadequate
training. However, obese individuals may be seeking direct
and specific information from HCPs about weight control.37
Among older populations and those with comorbidities,
poor health or a lack of time or energy may contribute to
making weight loss seem unachievable. HCPs can counsel
patients that even modest weight reductions of 5­10% may
improve blood pressure, serum lipid levels, glucose toler-
ance, and reduce incidence of diabetes and hypertension.4
A multidisciplinary team consisting of a primary-care
physician, behavioral psychologist, registered dietitian
and exercise psychologist may aid in the treatment of

obesity counseling into their practice may find these
references useful.35,40,41
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Clinical Guide-
lines recommend the combination of reduced calorie diet
and increased physical activity to produce weight loss,
decrease abdominal fat and increase cardio­respiratory
fitness.19 Our analysis showed that 460% of overweight or
obese adults pursued at least one weight management
strategy, but o40% pursued both changes in diet and
physical activity. Similarly, Bish et al. reported that among
individuals trying to lose weight, fewer (13% women and
16% men) combined reduced calories with at least 200 min
per week of physical activity.42 In addition to correcting
weight perception, HCPs have an opportunity to educate
overweight or obese patents about healthy weight loss
strategies and normal weight patients about healthy weight
maintenance strategies. Other weight loss strategies exist,
such as bariatric surgery or use of prescription drugs, but
were not examined in analysis as being a practical lifestyle
change regardless of weight status.
A major strength of our study is the use of a nationally
representative sample rather than a sample of selected obese
patients seeking medical care, which may not be general-
izable to overweight individuals who are unaware of their
weight status. In addition, use of standardized measurements
of height, weight and WC provided reliable information
about a participant's measured weight status.
The limitations of this study were primarily in self-report
of diagnosis of health outcomes and pursuit of weight
control. Self-reported diagnosis of overweight status may be
subject to recall bias if those who perceive themselves to
be overweight were more likely to report a diagnosis of
overweight/obesity. It is possible that we overestimated the
effect of overweight perception on pursuit of weight control
if those in higher weight groups were also more likely to over
report weight control attempts. The cross-sectional study
design of the NHANES did not allow us to examine if
overweight perception was associated with successful weight
loss. Use of BMI as a measure of the high risk form of obesity
may misclassify physically fit individuals with dense muscle
mass as overweight. We addressed this limitation by
additionally using WC as a measure of obesity. Finally, the
majority of excess deaths due to overweight occur among
individuals o70 years of age.1 Weight loss counseling should
be approached with caution among those older than X70
years as this population may not benefit from weight loss or
have special dietary needs and physical limitations that may
prevent vigorous physical activity or make weight loss
unhealthy.43,44
In conclusion, we report that overweight perception and
HCP diagnosis of overweight/obesity were positively asso-
ciated with weight control attempts in US adults. A diagnosis
of overweight/obesity may correct weight perception
and provide motivation to adopt healthy weight control
practices.
