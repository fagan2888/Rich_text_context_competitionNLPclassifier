Objectives. The Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study used three cognitive
interventions (memory, reasoning, or speed of processing) in order to improve cognitive abilities. In this article, we
evaluate ACTIVE's ability to avoid extensive decline in health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
Methods. ACTIVE enrolled 2,802 adults aged 65 or older and randomized them into one of three cognitive inter-
ventions or a no-contact control group. Researchers obtained data on 2,147 participants at the 24-month follow-up. We
measured HRQoL by using the eight Short Form-36 scales, and we defined clinically relevant decline on each as a drop of
0.5 standard deviations from baseline. We defined extensive HRQoL decline as clinically relevant drops on four or more
Short Form-36 scales, and we assessed this by using multiple logistic regression methods that adjusted for
sociodemographic, cognitive, and health status covariates, and incorporated propensity score derived weights in order
to adjust for potential attrition bias.
Results. We found that 25.0% of ACTIVE participants had extensive HRQoL decline. Participants in the speed-of-
processing intervention arm were less likely to have extensive HRQoL decline (adjusted odds ratio ¼ 0.643; p ¼ .004)
compared with controls, and participants in the memory and reasoning arms were equivalent to controls (adjusted odds
ratios ¼ 1.149 and 1.014, respectively; ps ¼ .322 and .919, respectively).
Discussion. Although all three intervention arms improved cognitive ability, only the speed-of-processing arm
protected against extensive clinically relevant decline in HRQoL.
ONE of the common issues facing older adults today is the
fear of declining cognitive ability and the onset of dif-
ficulties with activities of daily living (ADLs) that is associated
with this decline (Pathy, Morley, & Sinclair, 2006). Difficulties
with basic, instrumental ADLs (IADLs), and cognitive ADLs are
the primary risk factors for nursing home placement, which is
perhaps the greatest concern facing older adults (Kane, Kane, &
Ladd, 1998). These concerns are well founded. Research has
shown that declines in cognitive abilities lead to increased risk of
developing difficulties with IADLs, that the accumulation of
IADL limitations leads to increased risk of developing difficulties
with basic ADLs, and that, taken together, these functional
declines are associated with increased likelihood of nursing home
placement (Wolinsky, Callahan, Fitzgerald, & Johnson, 1992,
1993). Research has also shown that once older adults are placed
in nursing homes, their risk of mortality is heightened, even after
adjusting for a variety of functional status and comorbidity
measures (Aneshensel, Pearlin, & Schuler, 1993; Wolinsky et al.,
1992). Failure to thrive is thought to play an important role in this
process (Braun, Wykle, & Cowling, 1988; Wolinsky, Stump, &
Callahan, 1997). There is also evidence suggesting that after
cognitive decline in elders has been documented, a triage process
is often initiated, resulting in decreased proclivity for appropriate
health services use, including both inpatient and outpatient
services (Wolinsky, Culler, Callahan, & Johnson, 1994;
Wolinsky, Stump, & Johnson, 1995).
It is not surprising, therefore, that there exists a multitude of
interventions for older persons with cognitive impairment
(Rowe & Kahn, 1998). Few interventions, however, have been
targeted at delaying or preventing the onset of cognitive
disabilities in cognitively intact older adults (Ball et al., 2002).
This is unfortunate, given that many basic cognitive abilities
and processes are related to measures of functional status, the
need for care, and quality of life. Therefore, improving cog-
nitive function might have short- and/or long-term effects on
daily activities related to independent living and might also
delay (or prevent the need for) nursing home placement, while
ensuring the independence and dignity of the aging population.
In their recent, thorough, and compelling review of the accu-
mulated longitudinal evidence supporting the cognitive reserve
hypothesis, Fratiglioni, Paillard-Borg, and Winblad (2004,
p. 343) concluded that there could be little doubt that ``an active
and socially integrated lifestyle in late life protects against
dementia and [Alzheimer's disease].'' However, investigators
have not adequately studied the subsequent effects of main-
tained cognitive ability on the daily functioning of older adults
and their quality of life (Ball et al., 2002). It was for that purpose
that the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute of

Nursing Research sponsored the Advanced Cognitive Training
for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study (Jobe et al.,
2001). The primary objective of ACTIVE was to test the
effectiveness and durability of three distinct cognitive inter-
ventions in improving the performance of older adults on basic
measures of cognition and measures of cognitively demanding
daily activities (e.g., food preparation, driving, medication use).
Previous reports from ACTIVE have strongly supported the
effectiveness and durability of the three cognitive training
interventions in improving the targeted cognitive ability (Ball
et al., 2002). This article takes the next logical step by focusing
on the ability of the three ACTIVE cognitive interventions to
delay clinically relevant declines in health-related quality of life
(HRQoL) during the first 24 months after their delivery.
Consistent with standard conceptualizations of the disablement
process (Wolinsky, 2006; Wolinsky & Miller, 2006), the
presumed etiological mechanism is that the decline of cognitive
abilities increases the likelihood of difficulty in performing
ADLs and IADLs, which in turn leads to a deterioration in
HRQoL (Ball et al.; Jobe et al., 2001). Evidence of the close
association between cognitive function and HRQoL supports
this conceptualization: (a) Higher cognitive function is related
to higher HRQoL (Lloyd, Boyle, Bell, & Thompson, 2000);
(b) decline in cognitive function is associated with lower
HRQoL (Carmelli, Swan, LaRue, & Eslinger, 1997) and higher
mortality (Wolinsky & Johnson, 1991); and (c) improvements
in cognitive function are correlated with improvements in
HRQoL (R. A. Cohen et al., 1999). Thus, preventing the loss of
cognitive ability would likely also prevent decline in HRQoL.
METHODS
Design
ACTIVE was a single-blind, randomized controlled trial with
three treatment arms and a no-contact control group. Each
treatment arm consisted of a 10-session intervention for one of
three cognitive abilities (memory, reasoning, or speed of
processing). Researchers provided a four-session booster train-
ing to a random subsample of trained participants approxi-
mately 11 months after training. Data collection personnel were
blind to participant treatment assignment. Training exposure
and social contact were standardized across interventions so
that each intervention served as a contact control for the other
two interventions. Therefore, the design allows for testing both
social contact effects (via the contact control group) and retest
effects (via the no-contact control group) on outcomes. Follow-
up interviews occurred immediately following training and at
12 and 24 months after training. For further details, see Jobe
and colleagues (2001).
Sample
Study organizers recruited from six field sites a large sample
of adults aged 65 or older (including a substantial proportion
of African Americans) who were living independent of formal
care but at risk for loss of functional independence. From
March 1998 through October 1999, organizers enrolled partic-
ipants across these sites by using a variety of sampling frames
and recruitment strategies described elsewhere (Jobe et al.,
2001). These recruitment strategies yielded 4,970 potential
participants. In addition to age, exclusion criteria were (a)
cognitive impairment (a Mini-Mental State Examination
[MMSE] score less than 23; Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh,
1975); (b) poor vision (less than 20/50); (c) dependence in
hygiene, bathing, or dressing; (d) diagnosed Alzheimer's
disease; (e) history of stroke in the previous 12 months; (f)
cancer with limited life expectancy; (g) current chemotherapy
or radiation treatment; (h) communication problems; (i)
a planned move from the study site area; (j) scheduling con-
flicts that would preclude participation in study activities; and
(k) prior involvement in similar cognitive training studies. In
all, 905 participants (18.1%) were ineligible and 1,263 (25.3%)
refused to complete screening or enroll in the study. Common
reasons for ineligibility included MMSE scores less than 23
(29.8% of 905), vision impairments (21.2%), and scheduling
conflicts (22.3%). Study organizers properly randomized 2,802
participants into the trial. At 24 months, researchers obtained
complete data on 2,147 participants (76.6%). Common reasons
for attrition were death (12.2% of 655), refusal to continue
participating in the study at some point after baseline data
collection (37.9%), and investigators' inability to locate
participants (33.0%) at the 24-month follow-up. Attrition (and
the reasons for it) was not associated with intervention or
control group status (overall retention rates were 80.1%, 79.4%,
81.8%, and 79.1% in the memory, reasoning, speed, and
control groups, respectively).
Interventions
Each of three interventions was directed at a specific cognitive
ability: memory, inductive reasoning, or speed of processing.
For each intervention, Sessions 1­5 focused on strategy
instruction and exercises to practice the strategy. Sessions 6­
10 provided additional practice exercises but introduced no new
strategies. A trainer's manual contained scripted content for each
of the 10 sessions. Reasoning training focused on inductive
reasoning (the ability to solve problems that follow a serial
pattern and that manifest in executive functioning). Researchers
taught participants strategies for identifying the pattern or
sequence required to solve a problem. Training exercises
involved identifying patterns in both laboratory-type reasoning
tasks and in everyday activities (e.g., understanding the pattern
in a bus schedule). Memory training focused on verbal episodic
memory, which deals with acquisition and retrieval of in-
formation acquired in a particular place at a particular time.
Investigators taught participants mnemonic strategies for re-
membering lists and sequences of items, text material, and main
ideas and details of stories and other text-based information.
Training exercises involved recalling laboratory-like episodic
memory tasks as well as tasks related to everyday activities
(such as recalling a shopping list). Speed training focused on
visual search and the ability to identify and locate visual
information quickly in a divided attention format, with and
without distraction. Participants practiced speeded tasks on
a computer and were allowed to proceed to more complex tasks
and faster and faster presentation speeds at their own pace. For
further details, see Jobe and colleagues (2001).
HRQoL
The Short Form-36 (SF-36) is the most widely used HRQoL
instrument in the world (Brazier, Harper, & Jones, 1992;
WOLINSKY ET AL.
S282
McHorney, Ware, & Raczek, 1993; Stewart, Hays, & Ware,
1988; Tarlov, Ware, & Greenfield, 1989; Ware & Kosinski,
1999; Ware, Kosinki, & Dewey, 2000; Ware & Sherbourne,
1992). It was developed through iterative data reduction
experiences with a variety of precursor measures used in the
Medical Outcomes Study. A detailed description of the devel-
opment procedures is available elsewhere (Ware, 1996), as is
the exact wording of the items (Ware & Kosinski; Ware et al.).
Of the 36 items, 35 make up eight scales: physical function-
ing (10 items), role limitations due to physical functioning (4
items), bodily pain (2 items), general health perceptions (5
items), vitality (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role lim-
itations due to emotional problems (3 items), and mental health
(5 items).
Within scales, we imputed missing data by using a prorated
method as long as the participant answers at least half of the
items within a scale. Simply put, we imputed the average of
those items for any unanswered items in that scale. Consistent
with national norms, imputation occurred for less than 5% of
the cases, and this did not vary by scale. Because of the
different numbers of items and response options in each scale,
we transformed raw scores to range from 0 (worst health) to
100 (best health). These could also be rescaled (normed) to
national data having a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of
10 by applying the appropriate algorithm (Ware et al., 2000).
This study assessed whether the cognitive interventions re-
sulted in clinically relevant changes in HRQoL. It was, there-
fore, necessary to establish criteria for such change. It is well
known that J. Cohen (1969) suggested that effect sizes of 0.20
to 0.50 standard deviations are small, effect sizes of 0.50 to
0.80 standard deviations are medium, and effect sizes of 0.80
standard deviations or greater are large. Although others have
argued for different categorical cut-offs, the most widely cited
of these alternative categorical cut-offs for meaningful change
are very close to Cohen's 0.50 standard deviation (or medium)
level (Feinstein, 1999; Sloan, Loprinzi, & Kuross, 1998; Testa,
1987). Moreover, a recent meta-analysis of 38 studies found
that the mean estimated meaningfully important difference was
0.495 standard deviations (Norman, Sloan, & Wyrwich, 2003).
Furthermore, if there are seven response options for each
question in the scale, an effect size of 0.50 standard deviations
is remarkably close to estimates of human abilities to
discriminate between two feeling states (Miller, 1956). Thus,
we used the 0.50 standard deviation effect size in this study in
order to define clinically relevant change in a single SF-36
scale; we defined extensive HRQoL decline as clinically
relevant change in four or more of the eight SF-36 scales.
Attrition Bias
Loss to follow-up may introduce attrition bias, even in well-
designed trials. One method of adjusting for potential attrition
bias is to weight the data based on participation rates within
propensity score quintiles. This method was developed by
Rubin (1979) in order to adjust for the absence of random
assignment in observational studies, subsequently popularized
by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983), and illustrated by D'Agos-
tino (1998). We obtained the propensity scores from a multiple
logistic regression model of attrition at 24 months by using the
set of cognitive intervention dummy variables and the covar-
iates (see below). Attriters were more likely to be older (ad-
justed odds ratio [AOR] ¼ 1.025, p , .001) and to be
men (AOR ¼ 1.412, p , .01), but less likely to be Caucasian
(AOR ¼ 0.562, p , .001) or to have high MMSE scores
(AOR ¼ 0.871, p , .001). None of the cognitive interventions
were associated with attrition. Overall, the propensity model for
attrition fit the data reasonably well (Hosmer­Lemeshow
statistic p value ¼ .418; C statistic ¼ .632), and, following
standard methods, we weighted the data for the multivariable
logistic regression by the inverse of the participation rate within
propensity score quintiles. For comparative purposes, we also
present here equivalent models that we did not weight to adjust
for the potential attrition bias.
Covariates
In addition to adjusting for potential attrition bias in the
multiple logistic regression analyses, we included 10 covariates
in order to ensure that the estimated effects of the cognitive
interventions on extensive decline in HRQoL were fully inde-
pendent from the effects of other background factors. The
covariates included age, gender, race, education, cognitive
function, basic ADLs, IADLs, cognitive ADLs, comorbid med-
ical conditions, and depressive symptoms. We measured age in
years. We measured gender as a binary contrast of men (coded
1) versus women (coded 0). We measured race as a binary
contrast of Caucasian (coded 1) versus African American
(coded 0). We measured education in years. We measured
cognitive function by using the MMSE (Folstein et al., 1975).
We assessed ADLs based on self-reports of difficulty in task
performance related to bathing, dressing, and hygiene consis-
tent with the Minimum Data Set (J. Morris & Morris, 1997;
J. N. Morris et al., 1997). Similarly, we measured IADLs
consistent with the Minimum Data Set by using self-reports of
difficulty in task performance for preparing meals, doing
housework, managing finances, managing health care, using the
phone, shopping, and traveling (J. Morris & Morris; J. N.
Morris et al.). We measured cognitive ADLs by using the
number of items correct on the Everyday Problems Test, which
is based on 14 common problem-solving scenarios (e.g.,
medication labels, transportation schedules; Willis, 1994), each
of which has two test items. We measured comorbid medical
conditions by using the Older American Resources and
Services protocol (Fillenbaum, 1988), which counts the number
of self-reported chronic diseases. Finally, we measured de-
pressive symptoms by using the 12-item version of the Center
for Epidemiological Studies­Depression scale (Radloff, 1977).
Analysis
We drew the data used in this analysis from ACTIVE's
baseline and 24-month follow-up assessments. The analytic
sample consisted of the 2,147 participants who completed the
24-month assessment, and we weighted the data by the inverse
of the participation rate within propensity score quintiles for
the multiple logistic regression models of extensive decline in
HRQoL at the 24-month follow-up (Hosmer & Lemeshow,
1989). In these models, we initially regressed extensive decline
in HRQoL on a set of dummy variables representing the three
cognitive intervention groups in order to obtain the crude effect
estimates. We then added the covariates into the model in order to
obtain the independent effects of the three cognitive interven-
tions. We evaluated model fit by using the Hosmer-Lemeshow
THE ACTIVE COGNITIVE TRAINING TRIAL S283
statistic (desired homoscedasticity exists when the p value is
not significant; Hosmer & Lemeshow), and the C statistic
(values greater than 0.50 indicate meaningful improvement over
chance, and values approaching 0.70 are considered good;
Hanley & McNeil, 1982).
RESULTS
Descriptive
Table 1 contains the means (or percentages) of the covariates
and SF-36 scale scores at baseline for the participants in each
of the ACTIVE treatment arms. Overall, the 2,147 ACTIVE
participants who were successfully interviewed 24 months after
intervention were 73.4 years old, 77.0% were women, 76.0%
were Caucasian, and mean educational attainment was 13.6
years. The mean MMSE score was 27.5, the average number of
ADLs with difficulty was 0.3, the average number of IADLs
with difficulty was 4.3, the mean number of successful answers
on the Everyday Problems Test was 19.2, the average number
of depressive symptoms was 5.0, and the mean number of
chronic conditions was 2.2. We observed no significant dif-
ferences in the distribution of any of these covariates across
the four treatment arms. The overall mean scores on the
SF-36 scales were 69.8 on physical functioning, 61.1 on role
limitations (physical), 66.1 on bodily pain, 87.0 on social func-
tioning, 80.2 on mental health, 75.5 on role limitations (emo-
tional), 62.0 on vitality, and 69.6 on general health perceptions.
The only significant difference on the distribution of the SF-36
scale scores across the four treatment arms involved the role
limitations (physical) scale, on which participants in the rea-
soning intervention averaged 4.3 points fewer than the grand
mean. The relatively high mean scores on the SF-36 scales,
especially in terms of social functioning, mental health, and role
limitations (emotional), indicate that these ACTIVE partic-
ipants were well adapted to their life situations, which was
likely a function of their high average educational attainment,
excellent MMSE scores, and limited levels of difficulty with
basic, instrumental, or cognitive ADLs.
Table 2 shows the mean changes from baseline to the 24-
month follow-up interview for each of the SF-36 scale scores
for the participants in each of the ACTIVE treatment arms.
These are crude (unadjusted) differences. In terms of the simple
change (i.e., gain/loss) scores, there were no significant dif-
ferences for any of the eight SF-36 scales across the treatment
arms. This reflects on the insensitivity of any of the individual
SF-36 scale scores in detecting changes over time (Wyrwich,
Tierney, Babu, Kroenke, & Wolinsky, 2005). Table 3 shows
the percentage of participants by treatment arm with clinically
important declines (i.e., 0.50 standard deviations) on each of
the SF-36 scales. Although the participants in the speed
treatment arm always had the lowest percentages, only the
differences for bodily pain were statistically significant.

Table 4 shows the mean total number of clinically important
declines and increases on each of the eight SF-36 scales by
treatment arm, as well as the percentage of participants who had
extensive declines in HRQoL. Here we observed a statistically
significant difference in the total number of clinically important
declines, with participants in the speed-training treatment group
averaging about 0.3 fewer declines on the eight SF-36 scale
scores than their counterparts. More importantly, although
25.0% of the participants overall had extensive decline in
HRQoL (i.e., clinically relevant declines on at least four of the
eight SF-36 scales), the distribution of extensive decline was
significantly different across the four treatment arms: 28.0% for
participants in the memory group, 26.7% for participants in the
reasoning group, 19.5% for participants in the speed group, and
25.8% for participants in the control group. This differential
distribution was highly statistically significant (p ¼ .006).
Multiple Logistic Regression
Table 5 contains the crude odds ratios (Models 1a and 1b)
and AORs (Models 2a and 2b) obtained from the two multiple
logistic regression models of extensive decline in HRQoL. We
weighted one set of models (Models 1a and 2a) to adjust for
potential attrition bias using the standard propensity score
method; the other set of models (Models 1b and 2b) was
unweighted. Models 1a and 1b provide the crude odds ratios for
the four treatment arms (the control group is the reference
category). As shown, and consistent with the above cross-
classification results, participants in the speed-training group
had lower odds of having extensive decline in HRQoL
compared with the control group, with 37.6% lower odds in
the weighted model (1a) and 31.4% lower odds in the
unweighted model (1b). The risk of extensive decline in
HRQoL for participants in the memory and reasoning training
groups did not differ from that of participants in the control
group (weighted or unweighted). When we added the 10
covariates into Models 2a and 2b, there was no appreciable
change in the protective effect of being in the speed-training
group. As is shown in Model 2a, among the covariates, age,
race, education, and depressive symptoms had statistically
significant effects, with a 2.9% increase in the odds for
extensive decline associated with each year of age, 21.1% lower
odds for Whites (compared with Blacks), a 6.8% decrease in
the odds for extensive decline associated with each year of
education, and a 2.2% decrease in the odds associated with each
depressive symptom. The effects of the covariates shown in
Model 2b (the unweighted analyses) were equivalent, although
the marginally statistically significant effects of race and de-
pressive symptoms shown in Model 2a were no longer statis-
tically significant. Overall, Model 2a fit the data fairly well
(Hosmer­Lemeshow statistic p value¼.318; C statistic¼.625).
DISCUSSION
ACTIVE is the largest randomized controlled trial yet
conducted that focuses on improving cognitive performance
among older adults (Jobe et al., 2001). Moreover, it is the first
such trial specifically designed to avoid or postpone cognitive
decline in normally functioning older adults in order to halt or
slow the adverse consequences of such cognitive decline
(including increases in basic, instrumental, and cognitive
ADLs; lower HRQoL; and higher health services use; and
nursing home placement). Previous research has shown that the
three distinct cognitive interventions in ACTIVE were all
successful in improving their proximal cognitive outcomes
(Ball et al., 2002). We have shown here that the speed-of-
processing training intervention was also successful in reducing
extensive decline in HRQoL over the first 24 months of follow-
up. Indeed, after adjustment for all of the covariates,
participants in the speed-training arm of ACTIVE had 35.7%
(p ¼ .006) lower odds of experiencing extensive decline than
participants in the control group.

THE ACTIVE COGNITIVE TRAINING TRIAL S285
The protective effect of the speed-training intervention, in the
absence of benefits accruing from the reasoning- and memory-
training arms, is not entirely surprising. As previously reported,
speed training had a substantially greater effect on improving
its proximal cognitive outcomes than did either of its counter-
parts (Ball et al., 2002). Specifically, 87% of the speed-, 74% of
the reasoning-, and 26% of the memory-trained participants
demonstrated reliable cognitive improvement (defined as a gain
in score greater than or equal to at least one standard error of
measurement) at the immediate post-test (Ball et al). Moreover,
participants in the speed-training group who also received
booster training had statistically significant improvements
in ADL and IADL functioning 12 months after baseline,
whereas participants in the reasoning- and memory-training
groups did not.
Nonetheless, these findings beg an important question. What
is it about speed-of-processing training that matters, at least in
terms of HRQoL? Although the answer cannot be definitively
determined from the ACTIVE study, it is likely that neuro-
biologic and psychosocial factors play important roles. Of the
three cognitive interventions, speed of processing is the most
clearly procedural. That is, speed of processing operates
through sensory-motor elaboration and repetition, whereas the
memory and reasoning interventions emphasize or require the
explicit learning of new concepts. Procedural tasks have a
broader pattern of regional brain activation (i.e., neostriatum
and cerebellum in addition to neocortex) than do explicit
memory tasks (Cabeza & Nyberg, 2000), and this may
contribute to the greater sense of well-being captured by the
HRQoL ratings. The psychosocial part of the explanation is that
such improved brain activation or structure may delay the onset
of (if not reduce the risk for) ``slowing down,'' which is the
single most dreaded fear of older adults, even though the
majority of them clearly recognize that they will ultimately face
``a slower pace of life'' (Cape, 1983, p.18). Therefore, to the
extent that participants in the speed-of-processing intervention
delayed or avoided tempo reductions, these older adults were
able to retain higher (i.e., baseline) perceptions of their HRQoL
compared with their counterparts.
The failure of the memory and reasoning interventions to
significantly reduce the risk of extensive decline in HRQoL
warrants further comment. It is possible that these null findings
may be somewhat artificial. First, although all three cognitive
interventions were designed to have substantial comparability
in terms of the number and length of sessions, there were
differences in delivery structure. The speed-of-processing inter-
vention involved more performance feedback from the trainer
to the participant throughout the training process than did either
the memory or reasoning interventions. Moreover, the feedback
delivered in the speed-of-processing intervention was more
concrete than that delivered in either the memory or reasoning
interventions. Because the HRQoL measures were subjective
self-evaluations, they may have been more sensitive to the
increased and more concrete performance feedback associated
with the speed-of-processing intervention. Second, although
the 10-session standard delivery package was adequate for the
speed-of-processing intervention, it may not have been suf-
ficient to reach the necessary thresholds for either the memory
or reasoning intervention. That is, the exposure (or training)
threshold for producing the desired effect for the memory and
reasoning interventions may require going well beyond 10
sessions. Although both of these possible explanations (i.e.,
differential performance feedback and differential training
thresholds) for the null findings for the memory and reasoning
interventions are plausible, they must be considered rather
speculative, inasmuch as they cannot be addressed in these
data.
We must recognize an important limitation in the design of
the ACTIVE study. Although ACTIVE was a randomized
controlled trial, which maximizes internal validity, its partic-
ipants were not recruited to be representative of the population
at large, which limits external validity (Shadish, Cook, &
Campbell, 2002). Indeed, the exclusion criteria for ACTIVE
intentionally screened out individuals with extant functional or
cognitive decline. Because of this, ACTIVE participants were
likely more resilient at baseline and less likely to decline by the
time of the 24-month follow-up than the average older adult.
One can observe this in the lack of functional decline in the
control group. This possibility notwithstanding, 1 in 4 ACTIVE
participants did experience extensive decline in HRQoL during
the observation period. Thus, although it is clear that the
ACTIVE interventions improved cognitive abilities and that
these improvements continued through 24 months (Ball et al.,
2002), most of the participants did not experience functional
decline during this time. Therefore, it is possible that expected
differential functional decline across treatment groups in the
future, as this select cohort enters more fully into an age of
functional loss, will contribute to additional and/or stronger
observed protective effects against extensive decline in
HRQoL.
What remains to be seen is whether the indisputable and
protective effect of the speed-of-processing intervention on
extensive decline in HRQoL reported here will be replicated
when other, more objective outcomes are considered. After all,
the SF-36 is a subjective and self-reported measure. This is not
a criticism of the SF-36. Indeed, due to its very nature, re-
searchers must assess HRQoL by using subjective self-reports,
and postponing or eliminating declines in HRQoL among
older adults is critically important. Nonetheless, one wonders
whether the protective effect of the speed-of-processing
intervention will translate into more appropriate and reduced
levels of health services utilization and resource consumption
and, ultimately, into greater longevity. Examining these more
objective outcomes is the next step in the ACTIVE study.
