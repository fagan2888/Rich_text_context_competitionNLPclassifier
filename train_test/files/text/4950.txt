Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the sedative efficacy and effects on early period cognitive function of
premedication in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).
Methods: Forty patients (18­70 years; American Society of Anesthesiology risk category I­III)
undergoing elective ERCP were randomized to receive oral premedication with 0.15 mg/kg
midazolam or 1 mg/kg tramadol. Cognitive function was determined by mini-mental test (MMT).
Target scores for effective sedation were determined as a Bispectral index score of 70­90 and
modified Ramsay Sedation Scale score (mRSS) of 2­4.
Results: Global MMT score was not significantly different between treatment groups at 60 min
post-ERCP. A significant deterioration in the MMT subcategory of recall was determined in with
midazolam versus tramadol. Level of sedation (mRSS) was higher in with midazolam compared with
tramadol reaching statistical significance at 30 min after drug administration.
Conclusions: Although more effective sedation was obtained with midazolam in patients
undergoing ERCP, there was a dysfunction in memory recall. It was concluded, however, that early
cognitive functions were generally preserved with both drugs.

Introduction
Endoscopic interventions for diagnosis and
treatment constitute a significant part of
outpatient anaesthesia.1 Endoscopic retro-
grade cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is
an invasive endoscopic technique used for
the diagnosis and treatment of biliary tract
and pancreatic duct pathologies.2 Because
ERCP is a longer and more complex pro-
cedure than upper endoscopy and colonos-
copy, deeper sedation and analgesia are
required.3 Trouble-free procedure time,
early recovery and protection of cognitive
function are essential in ERCP. Short-term
and temporary postoperative cognitive dys-
function (POCD) may occur although
POCD may also continue beyond 7 days.5,6
Moderate levels of sedoanalgesia may
improve patient satisfaction and procedural
comfort and can be achieved through pre-
medication. The ideal premedication agent
should provide sedation and anxiolysis, and
should increase the quality of recovery and
maintenance.4 Midazolam and tramadol are
short-acting drugs that may be used as
premedication. Data regarding oral admin-
istration of tramadol in ERCP premedica-
tion have not been published in English.
Furthermore, studies evaluating the effect of
premedication on cognitive function in the
early period after outpatient ERCP are also
lacking.
The current study aimed to determine the
sedative and analgesic contributions of
premedication with oral midazolam or tra-
madol and the effects on early period cog-
nitive function in patients undergoing
elective ERCP under controlled remifentanil
anaesthesia.
Patients and methods
Study population [B-heading]
Outpatients aged 18­70 years undergoing
elective ERCP in the Endoscopy Unit of the
Gastroenterology Department, Karadeniz
Technical University Medical Facility,
Trabzon, Turkey between September 2008
and January 2010 who were classified as
having American Society of Anesthesiology
(ASA) risk status I­III were enrolled in the
current study. Patients were excluded if they
were classified as having an ASA status
of > III, morbid obesity, major organ dys-
function (respiratory, renal and hepatic),
history of drug addiction, known hypersen-
sitivity for tramadol, midazolam or remifen-
tanil, or a mini-mental test (MMT)
score 23.
The study was registered with the Clinical
Trials.gov protocol registration system
(NCT02436980) and was approved by the
Institutional Ethics Committee of Karadeniz
Technical University (07.07.2008/No:499).
All patients participating in the study pro-
vided written informed consent.
Study procedures [B-heading]
At 45 min prior to the start of the ECRP
procedure, patients were taken to the
preoperative preparation room of the
Endoscopy Department. Vital signs includ-
ing blood pressure, heart rate, peripheral
oxygen saturation and respiration rate
(Dash 2000 Patient Monitor, GE Medical
Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA), Bispectral
index (BIS; BIS-XP Quatre, AspectTM
Medical Systems, St Newton, MA, USA),
modified Ramsey Sedation Scale (mRSS)
Ulusoy et al. 543
score and pain score (numeric rating scale
(NRS), 0­10) were recorded at baseline in all
patients by the same researcher (HU) who
was unaware of the study drug. Target
scores for effective sedation were defined
as: BIS of 70­90 and mRSS score of 2­4.
Patients were randomized by closed-
envelope method to receive 0.15 mg/kg mid-
azolam (DormicumÕ, Roche Mu
¨ stahzarlari
A.S
¸., Istanbul, Turkey) (group M) or 1 mg/
kg tramadol (ContramalÕ, Abdi Ibrahim
Ilac
¸ San., Istanbul, Turkey) (group T)
administered orally in 10 ml of cherry juice
without particles.
Patients were moved to the endoscopy
unit 30 min after administration of pre-
medication. Nasal cannula were inserted to
be maintained throughout the whole pro-
cedure and started with 4 l/dk O2
. With
patients in the lateral decubitus position,
analgesia and sedation at adequate depth
was achieved during ERCP using 1 mg/kg
remifentanil (UltivaÕ GlaxoSmithKline,
Istanbul, Turkey) administered intraven-
ously via perfusor (PerfusorÕ compact S,
B/BRAUN, Melsungen, Germany) for
5 min. Remifentanil was maintained at
0.2 mg/kg per min throughout the procedure.
Incomplete sedation was considered when
uncontrolled movements, hypertension
(increase of ! 40 mmHg from baseline sys-
tolic blood pressure (SBP)), tachycardia
(increase of ! 30% from baseline heart rate
or ! 90 beats per min), BIS ! 90, or mRSS
score 2 were observed. In cases of incom-
plete sedation, up to two further doses of
1 mg midazolam were administered intra-
venously. If, despite additional midazolam,
sedation was still inadequate (mRSS 2 or
BIS ! 90), 0.5 mg/kg propofol was adminis-
tered intravenously as a rescue sedative.
Over sedation was defined as hypotension
(20% decrease from baseline in SBP or
SBP < 90 mmHg), bradycardia (heart rate-
50 beats per min), development of
bradypnea (respiration rate six per min),
oxygen desaturation (SpO2
90%),
BIS 70, or mRSS score! 5. In the event of
over sedation, remifentanil infusion was tem-
porarily discontinued. Anaesthesia manage-
ment was carried out in all ERCP procedures
by the same anaesthetist (IC) who was
unaware of the premedication drug. ERCP
procedures were performed by the same
endoscopist (MA) who was also blinded to
premedication drug. During the process,
hyoscine-N-butyl bromide (BuscopanÕ
20mg/ml ampoule, Eczacibasi Drug
Company, Istanbul, Turkey), a smooth mus-
cale anti-spasmolytic, was used to control
oddi sphincter spasm; the amount of hyoscine
N-butylbromide used was recorded.
Patients with a NRS score > 3 after entry
to the recovery room post-ECRP received
1 g paracetamol intravenous infusion
(PerfalganÕ, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Istanbul,
Turkey). Aldrete scores were recorded at entry
to the recovery unit and after 60min. Patients
in whom ERCP was successfully completed or
who had undergone their final study
evaluations (in the case of an unsuccessful
procedure), who did not experience any side
effects, had a NRS score< 3 and who fulfilled
recovery criteria (modified Aldrete sedation
score ! 9), were discharged accompanied by a
responsible adult attendant.
The primary study endpoint was meas-
urement of early period cognitive function;
the secondary endpoint was determination
of sedative efficacy.
Patient evaluations [B-heading]
Vital signs were automatically measured at
prespecified time-points during ERCP and
in the recovery unit as shown Table 1.
Sedation, agitation and pain levels were
evaluated in terms of BIS, mRSS and NRS
at various time-points before, during and
after the procedure as presented in Table 1.

Cognitive function was evaluated before
administration of premedication and 60 min
post-ERCP using the MMT.7 The MMT is
an 11-question measure that tests five areas
of cognitive function: orientation (10
points), registration memory (three points),
attention and calculation (five points), recall
(three points) and language (nine points) for
a maximum score of 30 points. If MMT
was 23 at 60 min post-ERCP, patients
were considered to be cognitively impaired;
a decrease of !2 in the total MMT score was
considered as a decrease in cognitive
function.5­7
Adequacy of patient sedation during
ECRP was evaluated using an endoscopist-
structured questionnaire administered after
completion of the procedure. Endoscopist
satisfaction with adequacy of sedation was
scored as: 0 ¼ bad, 1 ¼ medium, 2 ¼ good
and 3 ¼ excellent. Patient satisfaction score
with sedation adequacy was also recorded
before discharge as: 0 ¼ bad, 1 ¼ medium,
2 ¼ good and 3 ¼ excellent. Simple question-
naires were used to gauge patient experience
of endoscopy and endoscopist satisfaction
before discharge. Although unvalidated,
both questionnaires were considered ade-
quate for this pilot study.
Total remifentanil dose used during
ERCP, need for additional analgesics (use
of paracetamol in patients with a NRS
score > 3), procedure success ratio (success-
ful: unsuccessful procedures), side effects of
treatment and patient preference for pre-
medication during next ERCP were also
recorded.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSSÕ software, version 13.0.1 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). Variables were analysed
using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to
determine if they were normally distributed.
Measurable data were compared between
treatment groups using Student's t- test for
normally distributed data and Mann­
Whitney U-test for data not conforming to
a normal distribution. Differences between
groups over time were evaluated using
repeat measures variance analysis (post-hoc
paired t-test) for normally distributed data
and Freidman's test (post-hoc Wilcoxon
signed-rank test) for non-normally distrib-
uted data. 2-test was used to compare
qualitative (nominal) and sequential
(ordinal) data in the different groups.
Measurable data were presented as
mean Æ SD and qualitative and sequential
data as frequencies and percentages. The
correlation between BIS and mRSS did not
conform to a normal distribution and so was
evaluated using Spearman's correlation ana-
lysis. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered to
be statistically significant.
Sample size was calculated to be 23
patients per treatment group (a ¼ 0.05 and
95% confidence interval with accuracy esti-
mate of d ¼ 0.1 and P ¼ 0.5). SPSSÕ software,
version 13.0.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA;
Serial Number: 9069728) was used for

and sedation, agitation and pain using the Bispectral

calculation of sample size. Withdrawal of
patients from the study after randomization
resulted in 20 patients in each treatment
group being available for analysis in the per-
protocol (PP) population. As a consequence,
a post-hoc power analysis was performed on
20 patients per group. Sample size was based
on the intra-group periodic examination;
effect size was calculated as 1.50 according
to mRSS difference between pre- and post-
drug administration in group M and power
was calculated as 0.99. In group T; effect size
was calculated as 1.27 and power as 0.99. For
the intra-group periodic examination, effect
size was calculated as 1.01 according to the
difference in BIS pre- and post-drug group M
and power was calculated as 0.99. Effect size
was calculated as 0.82 according to MMT test
difference in group M and group T and power
was calculated as 0.
Results
Of 54 patients scheduled for elective ERCP,
45 were recruited into the study and rando-
mized to receive midazolam (group M,
n ¼ 23) or tramadol (group T, n ¼ 22).
Three patients were withdrawn from the
study in group M and two were withdrawn
in group T leaving 20 patients in each group
in the PP population (Figure 1). Of the
patients that were withdrawn, one patient in
each treatment group experienced an unsuc-
cessful ERCP procedure due to oddi sphinc-
ter spasm. The ERCP procedure under
sedoanalgesia with premedication was com-
pleted with success and without complica-
tions in all patients included in the PP
population. No significant between-group
differences were observed with respect
to demographics, ERCP characteristics or
MMT markers in both the intention-to-treat
(ITT) and PP populations (Table 2).
Mean arterial pressure was significantly
lower in patients treated with midazolam
premedication compared with patients who
received tramadol at periods T2
­T6
and T10
(P ¼ 0.039, P ¼ 0.028, P ¼ 0.034, P ¼ 0.008,
P ¼ 0.017 and P ¼ 0.007, respectively)
(Figure 2A). Decreases in MAP continued
in normal physiological margins from pre-
medication to discharge in both treatment
groups. No statistically significant differ-
ences were observed between the two pre-
medication groups in terms of heart rate or
peripheral oxygen saturation (Figure 2B and
Figure 2C).
Level of sedation, as measured by the
mRSS, was higher in group M compared
with group T and this reached statistical
significance at 30 min after administration of
premedication (P ¼ 0.013) (Figure 3A).
Compared with levels of sedation before
premedication, mRSS scores were signifi-
cantly higher at time-periods T2
, T5
, T7
, T9
and T10
in patients receiving midazolam and
at periods T5
, T7
and T9
in patients receiving
tramadol respectively (P ¼ 0.0005 both
groups). No significant difference was
found between treatment groups at periods
T1
­T10
with respect to BIS values
(Figure 3A). A significant decrease in BIS
scores was determined between baseline (T1
)
and time-periods T2
­T9
and T5
­T9
in group
M and group T, respectively (P ¼ 0.0005
both groups). There was no significant
between-group differences in the rate of
patients reaching target sedation levels
(mRSS score, 2­4; BIS,70­90) after pre-
medication (group M, 25%; group T, 0%).
A significant negative correlation between
BIS and mRSS score was observed at time-
points T5
and T7
(5 min and 15 min after
premedication) and at T9
(entry to the
recovery room) (P 0.025; Table 3). BIS
and mRSS scores were more strongly corre-
lated in group M compared with group T.
There was no difference between pre-
medication treatment groups with regards
to MMT global score at baseline (T1
) or at
60 min after ERCP (T10
). Similarly, there
were no significant differences between treat-
ment groups at T1
or T10
in the MMT
subcategories of orientation, registration,

(Figure 4). A significant deterioration in
the recall subcategory was determined in the
midazolam group but not in the tramadol
group (P ¼ 0.024; Figure 4). A decrease in
total MMT score and all subcategories was
determined in the midazolam group at
60 min post-ERCP with respect to baseline,
but this did not reach statistical significance.
Although there was a decrease in MMT
total score in the tramadol group, no
decrease was observed in `memory' (recall)
subcategory.
Pain levels, as determined by NRS scores,
and need for additional analgesic medication
were not significantly different between
groups at any time-point during the study
(data not shown). Similarly, no differences
were observed between premedication groups
with regards to total remifentanil infusion
during ERCP and requirement for additional
bolus midazolam (data not shown).

No difference in parasympathetic need
was observed between patients who received
midazolam or tramadol premedication
(Table 2.).
Patient satisfaction and endoscopist sat-
isfaction scores with sedation were not sig-
nificantly different between patients in
group M and group T (Table 4). Side effects
of treatment occurred at similar rates in
both treatment groups, with the exception of
hypertension, which was experienced by
significantly more patients in group T
compared with group M (P ¼ 0.044;
Table 4).
Discussion
The current study demonstrated that pre-
medication with oral midazolam prior to
ERCP was associated with a greater sedative
action compared with tramadol premedica-
tion. Cognitive function in the early period

patients who received midazolam prior to
the procedure.
There is, as yet, no consensus in the
medical literature regarding the safest and
most effective doses of sedative agents
during ERCP. Remifentanil is an opioid
that can be used alone or with other sedative
agents in endoscopic gastrointestinal
procedures and other outpatient interven-
tions.8­11 It has previously been demon-
strated that adequate and safe
sedoanalgesia can be obtained with midazo-
lam premedication and remifentanil

infusion (0.1­0.15 mg/kg per min) in ERCP
procedures.10 Remifentanil was also used in
the current study for analgesia and sedation
although a dose of 0.20 mg/kg per min was
employed.
In endoscopic procedures, premedication
may have advantages such as reduction in
drug demand for sedation, anxiolysis and
induction and contribution to haemo-
dynamic stability in conscious sedation pro-
cedures.12 Outpatient procedures like
ERCP, however, require that premedication
drugs should be short acting, have sedative
and analgesic contributions, not delay
recovery and have minimal effect on cogni-
tive function. As a consequence, benzodi-
azepines and analgesics are frequently used
for this purpose.13,14
A limited number of studies have eval-
uated premedication in ERCP and differing
conclusions have been drawn regarding the
sedative contributions of benzodiazepines.
In one study, 7.5 mg midazolam orally
30 min prior to ERCP conducted under
propofol sedation was shown to be asso-
ciated with a reduction in desaturation as a
consequence of a decreased need for propo-
fol; in addition, a positive synergistic effect
of both drugs was noted with respect to
anxiolysis.13 Another study, however,
demonstrated that premedication using
1 mg lorazepam orally in patients undergo-
ing ERCP had no advantage in decreasing
sedative needs and increasing haemo-
dynamic stability.14
A previous randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial compared the seda-
tive effects of oral premedication with 7.5 mg
midazolam with 150 mg clonidine adminis-
tered 60­90 min prior to induction of

anaesthesia in healthy subjects undergoing
elective surgery.15 In this study, BIS
values were significantly decreased in mid-
azolam-treated subjects compared with pla-
cebo-treated subjects at 60­90 min after
administration of premedication, upon
entry to the post-anaesthesia care unit
(PACU) and 60 min after entry to the
recovery room. No significant change was,
however, observed in sedation scores.
Inconsistency may be detected between BIS
and sedation scores but the reason for this is
not clear.15 In contrast, the present study
demonstrated a correlation between BIS
values and sedation scores. The current
study used similar midazolam doses to
those employed in the study by Paris
et al.15 but levels of sedation were lower.
This may be due to residual benzodiazepine
sedative effects. In the previous randomized
study in which the average surgery time was
more than 120 min, no residual sedative
effect with respect to BIS values was
observed after 120 min in the PACU in
midazolam-treated subjects. No sedative
effects were observed after 60 min in the
PACU in both treatment groups in the
current study.
Tramadol is also used as premedication
for general anaesthesia and sedation
although its use is not as widespread as
midazolam.16­18 Oral tramadol has been
previously compared with midazolam as a
paediatric premedication or in dental sur-
gery.18 Use of tramadol premedication in
gastroenterological procedures has been
investigated although no follow-up assess-
ment of any sedation/analgesia scale was
performed.16 A previous placebo-controlled
study demonstrated that tramadol pre-
medication (100 mg orally) significantly
decreased anxiety scores and analgesic
need in patients undergoing surgical extrac-
tion of the mandibular third molar.17
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopan-
creatography is generally planned as an
ambulatory procedure. POCD is a relatively
frequent occurrence that may negatively
affect recovery and discharge after out-
patient interventions. It can be defined as a
20% decrease in psychomotor test (e.g.
Digit-Symbol-Substitution Test (DSST),
Trieger Dot Test and MMT) scores from
preoperative values.19 Therefore, it is
important to consider the effects of drugs
used in anaesthesia and premedication on
POCD. The incidence of POCD has been
reported to range between 7% and 60%
depending on the patient groups or proced-
ure type investigated.20 Studies have shown
that cognitive function and psychomotor
performance decreased significantly after
monitored anaesthesia care and after gen-
eral anaesthesia when sedative drugs and/or
analgesics were used.21 Patient discharge is
usually planned within 2­3 h following inter-
ventional and endoscopic procedures but
the effects of a medication on POCD plays
an important role in determining when to
discharge a patient, particularly after with
ambulatory surgery with sedoanalgesia.
Findings from the International Post-
Operative Cognitive Dysfunction Study-1
demonstrated that rates of POCD were
25.8% in the first week following surgery
and 9.9% in the third month.5
The effects of premedication on post-
operative cognitive function are investigated
when patients are fully conscious using
neuropsychological tests performed both
pre- and postprocedure.7 The MMT is one
of the most frequently used tests in the
evaluation of early postoperative cognitive
function or psychomotor recovery quality,
with an MMT score of <25 regarded as
indicating POCD at Day 1.7,22 Subtests (e.g.
tendency, registration memory, attention
and calculation, recall and language) help
to evaluate different cognitive functions;
anaesthetic agents especially have a negative
effect on memory. A study in elderly patients
undergoing cataract surgery demonstrated
that there was a correlation between deteri-
oration in postoperative memory
Ulusoy et al. 553
performance in Luria tests and the first
benzodiazepine dose.23 In studies performed
in healthy subjects, it was suggested that
midazolam might be a key drug in the
development of prolonged psychomotor
and subjective impairment;21,24 impairment
in hand-eye coordination was found to
continue even at 75 min after administration
of midazolam.21 Another study demon-
strated that 5 mg diazepam administered
intravenously before gastrointestinal endos-
copy caused significant impairment in cog-
nitive function compared with control
patients in the early period (30 min), which
was independent of blood drug level, patient
age and plasma albumin levels.25
Preferred drugs for premedication prior
to endoscopic procedures are those with
short-term effectiveness that contribute to
sedation and/or analgesia but that do not
delay recovery. Some studies assert that
discharge is not delayed with benzodiazep-
ines in outpatient surgeries. In one evalu-
ation in elderly patients who underwent
cataract surgery under local anaesthesia,
0.049 mg/kg midazolam oral premedication
provided adequate sedation and cognitive
functions were protected compared with
controls.26 The authors of this study recom-
mended midazolam premedication because
no differences in numerical and verbal
memory and concentration tests were
observed during the early postoperative
period (120 min) and it was well tolerated
with respect to vital findings.26 In another
study, it was reported that the incidence of
deep sedation and desaturation increased
preoperatively following premedication with
intravenous midazolam premedication in
geriatric patients although mental and psy-
chomotor recovery was not affected in the
early postoperative period (60 min and
120 min).27 Similarly, when intravenous
midazolam (2 mg), fentanyl (50 mg) and/or
propofol (35 mg) was administered to
healthy subjects, no clinically significant
psychomotor impairment was observed at
180 min and 240 min postinjection.21 In a
meta-analysis of premedication studies that
involved use of benzodiazepines for preven-
tion of presurgery anxiety, no delay in
discharge time was observed; in some of
the included studies it was reported that
despite some minimal impairment in psy-
chomotor function, this did not delay
discharge.28
There are few data available regarding
the postoperative cognitive effects of trama-
dol used as premedication. In the limited
number of studies in the literature, cognitive
function was investigated in patients who
were received tramadol for postoperative
analgesia. In one study, it was shown that
postoperative tramadol was an important
risk factor for POCD in patients aged >75
years who underwent major abdominal sur-
gery.29 Results from another study that
evaluated the performance side-effect profile
of high and low dose oral tramadol (200 mg
or 50 mg four-times daily) in subjects being
treated for opioid dependence, demon-
strated that lower doses of tramadol were
well tolerated in cognitive and psychomotor
tests including DSST.30
In the present study, a decrease in total
MMT score and all subcategories was
determined in the midazolam group at
60 min post-ERCP with respect to baseline,
but this did not reach statistical significance.
Although there was a decrease in MMT
total score in the tramadol group, no
decrease was observed in `memory' (recall)
subcategory. A significant impairment was
determined in the recall subcategory in
patients who received tramadol as pre-
medication compared with patients who
received midazolam premedication.
In conclusion, premedication with mid-
azolam in patients undergoing ERCP pro-
vides more effective sedation compared with
tramadol premedication but is also asso-
ciated with in memory. With respect to
POCD, it was determined that cognitive
function in the early postoperative period
554 Journal of International Medical Research 44(3)
was generally maintained and satisfying
procedure comfort was provided with both
drugs. While midazolam may be preferred
for premedication for ERCP due to more
effective sedation, clinicians should be pre-
pared for dysfunction in the recall subcat-
egory of the MMT in the post-procedure
period.
