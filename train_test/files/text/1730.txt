Research
Pyrethroids are the latest class of insecticides in
global widespread use and are replacing
organophosphates in agricultural and consumer
applications (Nishi et al. 2006). Pyrethroids
exert their neurotoxicity by slowing the open-
ing and closing of voltage-gated sodium chan-
nels in insect and mammalian nerve cells
(Shafer et al. 2005). Recent toxicologic studies
show interference with chloride channels and
other target systems (Ray and Fry 2006; Shafer
and Meyer 2004). Although the acute toxicity
to humans is well documented (Spencer and
O'Malley 2006), data on health effects of
lower-level exposures are currently limited to
animal studies. Findings from these suggest
that additional research on human exposures is
warranted. In their review of 22 rodent studies,
for example, Shafer et al. (2005) report associa-
tions between in utero pyrethroid exposures and
persistent changes in neurochemistry, motor
activity, behavior, and learning.
In July 2005, the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) reported mea-
surable levels of 3-phenoxybenzoic acid
(3PBA), a metabolite of several commonly
used pyrethroids, including permethrin, cyper-
methrin, cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, and fen-
valerate, in 75% of urine samples analyzed for
pesticides (n = 3,048) in the U.S. National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 1999­2002 (CDC 2005a,
2005b). Pyrethroids are metabolized in mam-
mals by ester hydrolysis and subsequent conju-
gation to a number of primary and secondary
metabolites, including 3PBA (Godin et al.
2007). In vitro studies with human liver
microsomes implicate carboxylesterases (Nishi
et al. 2006; Ross et al. 2006), alcohol and alde-
hyde dehydrogenases (Choi et al. 2002), and
cytochrome p450 (CYP450) isoforms (Godin
et al. 2007) as responsible enzymes. A handful
of studies using adult volunteers and pest con-
trol operators estimated half-lives of 3PBA in
urine of 6­24 hr after pyrethroid exposure,
with near complete elimination after several
days (Eadsforth et al. 1988; Eadsforth and
Baldwin 1983; Leng et al. 1996, 1997, 2003;
Woollen et al. 1992).
Despite the NHANES evidence of wide-
spread exposure in the U.S. population, little is
known about how Americans are exposed to
pyrethroids. Current research shows that both
diet and nondiet factors may be important pre-
dictors of body burden. In their study of 23
children 3­11 of age in Seattle, Washington,
Lu et al. (2006) found associations between
urinary 3PBA and reported use of pyrethroids
around the home and on pets, and eating con-
ventional versus organic diets. Three small-
scale (n < 200) studies conducted in 2002 by
the CDC to evaluate exposures to pyrethroids
sprayed for vector control found significant
associations between urinary 3PBA and use of
pesticides on pets in one study, but no signifi-
cant difference in 3PBA before and after (1­4
days) spraying in any study (CDC 2005h). In
their study of 386 mother­infant pairs in New
York City, Berkowitz et al. (2003) found lower
urinary 3PBA among women living in public
versus private housing, but no consistent asso-
ciations among 3PBA and other sociodemo-
graphic or pesticide use predictors. Williams
et al. (2006) detected permethrin in plasma
from 17 New York City women who reported
using pyrethroids to control roaches at home
versus none in samples from 21 women using
alternative strategies.
Research conducted in Europe suggests that
diet is an important exposure pathway. Urinary
3PBA has been regularly detected among
German subjects reporting no household use or
occupational exposure to pyrethroids (Heudorf
and Angerer 2001; Heudorf et al. 2004;
Schettgen et al. 2002). A small-scale study by
Saieva et al. (2004) of 69 adult volunteers in
two Italian cities provides similar indirect evi-
dence for the influence of diet. In their national
pilot study of German children 2­17 years of
age (n = 396), Becker et al. (2006) found asso-
ciations between urinary 3PBA and reported
intake of boiled vegetables.
We used a regression approach to evaluate
major diet and nondiet predictors of urinary
3PBA in the NHANES 1999­2002 pesticide
subsample. We stratified subjects into child
(6­10 years), teen (11­18 years), and adult
( 19 years) age groups based on the a priori
assumption that exposure factors differ signifi-
cantly by life stage (National Research Council
1993). Our objective was to explore the relative
importance of diet versus nondiet predictors in

BACKGROUND: 3-Phenoxybenzoic acid (3PBA), a pyrethroid metabolite, was detected in 75% of
urine samples analyzed for pesticides in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) 1999­2002. NHANES also includes 24-hr diet data and information on
household pesticide use, activities, occupation, demographics, and other exposure factors.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to explore the relative importance of diet versus
nondiet predictors in explaining variability in urinary 3PBA. A secondary objective was to explore
whether the NHANES data could be used to identify particular foods driving 3PBA levels.
METHODS: We divided subjects into child (6­10 years of age), teen (11­18 years), and adult ( 19
years) age groups and restricted our analyses to subjects in the morning sampling session who
fasted for  8 hr beforehand. Regression modeling consisted of several model-building steps and a
final Tobit regression on the left-censored log 3PBA measurements. We also conducted bootstrap
analyses to evaluate the stability of the regression parameters.
RESULTS: Reported household pesticide use was not significantly associated with urinary 3PBA in
any age group. Diet was significant for all three groups, and certain foods appeared to contribute
more than others. Among adults, tobacco use was positively associated with 3PBA (p = 0.0326),
and positive associations were suggested with the number of cytochrome p450­inhibiting medica-
tions taken (p = 0.0652) and minutes spent gardening (p = 0.0613) in the past month.
CONCLUSIONS: Although exploratory, our findings underline the importance of collecting accurate
data on household pesticide use and dietary intake when evaluating pyrethroid exposure­biomarker
relationships.

explaining variability in urinary 3PBA for each
age group. A secondary objective was to explore
whether the NHANES data could be used to
identify particular foods driving urinary 3PBA
levels in each group. Our overall goal was to
help identify major pathways of pyrethroid
exposure in everyday American life and thus
inform the design of future exposure and inter-
vention studies.
Methods
NHANES data collection. Detailed data collec-
tion methods are available at the NHANES
website (CDC 2007a, 2007b). NHANES was
approved by the CDC Institutional Review
Board. Briefly, urine samples were collected
during the medical examination. Subjects were
randomly stratified into morning (50% of sub-
jects) and afternoon/evening sessions (50% of
subjects), with morning sampling beginning at
approximately 0830 hours, afternoon sampling
at 1330 hours, and evening sampling at
1730 hours. Subjects in morning, afternoon,
and evening sessions were requested to fast
from 2300­0830 hours, 0730­1330 hours,
and 1130­1730 hours, respectively (CDC
2001). Self-reported fasting duration was
recorded before sample collection. A 24-hr
dietary recall interview was conducted where
subjects worked with trained interviewers using
measurement aids to record all foods/beverages
consumed from midnight to midnight the day
before the examination (CDC 2005c). The
recall data include estimates of grams eaten by
descriptive eight-digit food code. To improve
accuracy, the computer-assisted interview used
in 1999­2001 was replaced by an automated
multipass method in 2002 (CDC 2002).
Although this method has been validated for
assessing adult macronutrient intakes (Conway
et al. 2004), we did not find peer-reviewed val-
idation studies for children, teens, or consump-
tion of individual foods.
Basic demographic data, as well as infor-
mation on household pesticide use, physical
activities, occupation, and other factors poten-
tially relevant to pesticide exposures, were col-
lected during the household sample person
interview (CDC 2005d, 2005e). Eligible adult
family members served as proxy respondents
for subjects 6­15 of age. Information on use of
pesticides in the home, yard, and foundation
during the previous month was collected using
a family questionnaire, administered with the
subject or household head. Interviews were
generally conducted 1 week before the exami-
nation, with the longest lag approximately
3 weeks (CDC 2005f). The pesticide use ques-
tions focused on chemicals used to "control
fleas, roaches, ants, termites, or other insects"
(CDC 2005d, 2005e).
We recoded the NHANES occupation
data to identify subjects with potential work-
place exposure. NHANES question OCD230
asked subjects the industry they worked in, and
question OCD240 asked the type of work they
performed. We created a new variable with five
response categories--don't work, other, farm,
cleaning, and working in a private house-
hold--and categorized subjects based on their
responses to questions OCD230 and OCD240.
Exclusion/inclusion rules for regressions. We
excluded subjects missing urinary 3PBA mea-
surements, missing diet interview data, or with
interviews coded "not reliable" (CDC 2005g).
In the adult group, we also excluded pregnant
subjects (18% of subjects tested) because uri-
nary 3PBA levels differed significantly between
pregnant and nonpregnant female subjects
(Wilcoxon rank sum p = 0.0036).
Because the dietary recall period ended at
midnight the night before sample collection,
we included only subjects who attended the
morning session and reported fasting  8 hr,
hoping to exclude subjects who ate foods that
were not recorded in the diet interview. We
used 8 hr as the cutoff because that was the
minimum duration between the midnight
close of the recall period and the earliest hour
of the morning examination session.
Preparation of dietary interview data.
Diet data for the pesticide subsample
included 3,573 eight-digit descriptive food
codes. Many (n = 1,031) of these foods were
eaten by only one subject. In the teen and
adult groups, we removed foods eaten by
< 1% of the restricted sample, whereas we
removed foods eaten by < 5% of the restricted
child sample. Including these rarely eaten
foods in the regressions would likely result in
unstable parameter estimates and would not
contribute to our understanding of variance
in urinary 3PBA, so we decided to exclude
them. We used 5% instead of 1% for the
child group because the child sample size was
approximately 30% and 16% of the teen and
adult sample sizes, respectively.
Regression model building. For each age
group, we adapted initial model building
from MacIntosh et al. (1997) and Romieu
et al. (1990), involving the following steps:
Step 1. Construct a list of potential
nondiet predictors of pyrethroid exposure
from the literature (Appendix 1).
Step 2. Screen individual nondiet predic-
tors by conducting univariate regressions of
log 3PBA on individual nondiet predictors,
passing only those with p-values  0.2 to step
3. The step 2 model form is
ln 3PBA = 0i
+ 1i
Xi
, [1]
where ln 3PBA is the ln-transformed urinary
3PBA concentration; i indexes the step 1
nondiet predictors, (i.e., i = 1, NND)
, and NND
is the total number of nondiet predictors
considered; Xi
represents the predictor in the
univariate regression. These are class indicators
for categorical variables or actual values for
continuous variables.
Step 3. Perform a single Tobit regression
(Tobin 1958) of 3PBA left-censored at the
detection limit on all step 2 nondiet predic-
tors, and select those predictors with p-value
 0.2 for inclusion in the final model (predic-
tors with p-values > 0.2 we manually removed
from the step 3 regression until all remaining
predictors had p-values  0.2). Tobit regres-
sion is appropriate for left-censored data sets
with normally/lognormally distributed error
terms (Helsel 1990; Kroll and Stedinger 1999;
Lubin et al. 2004). The step 3 model form is
ln 3PBA = 0
+ j
1j
Xj
, [2]
where j indexes the nondiet predictors (cate-
gorical and continuous) that pass the step 2
screen (note that this is a subset of the step 2
predictors, such that j  i); Xj
represents the
predictor in the multivariable regression.
Step 4. Perform a backward elimination
regression of the residuals from step 3 on
reported 24-hr grams eaten by food code, and
select only those food codes with p-values
 0.2 for inclusion in the final model. The
step 4 model form is
R(ln 3PBA)ND
= 0
+ k
1k
Xk
, [3]
where R(ln 3PBA)ND
are the residuals from
the step 3 regression, k indexes the individual
food item (e.g., carrots), and Xk
indicates the
number of grams of food item k consumed
by each subject.
To control for urine dilution, we included
creatinine as a predictor at each regression step.
Creatinine is sometimes used this way because
its excretion rate is independent of urine flow
(Boeniger et al. 1993). Although this approach
has limitations, including diurnal, seasonal,
and age-related changes in creatinine excretion
rates (Barr et al. 2005; Lu et al. 2006), urinary
creatinine was the only physiologic variable
available in NHANES for dilution correction.
Final regression models. For each age
group, we fitted the final model using Tobit
regression, ln 3PBA, and only the predictors
that passed steps 2­4. We included second-
order polynomials and interaction terms for
the nondiet predictors, whereas we tested
food predictors for main effects only. The
final model form is
where 0
is the overall mean of the ln-trans-
formed urinary 3PBA concentration, j indexes
the nondiet predictors, m indexes the nondiet
predictor interaction terms, 1j
is the linear
regression coefficient for the jth nondiet

predictor, 2j
is the quadratic regression
coefficient for the jth nondiet predictor, 3jm
is the regression coefficient for the interaction
between the jth and mth nondiet predictors,
k´ indexes the individual food predictor that
passed step 4, 4k´ is the linear regression coef-
ficient for the k´th food predictor, and Xk´
indicates the number of grams of food k´
consumed by each subject.
After step 3, step 4, and the final model
fitting, we evaluated our model assumptions
(normality, homoskedasticity) by examining
plots of predicted values versus standardized
residuals, and histograms and normal proba-
bility plots of standardized residuals. We used
PROC LIFEREG and PROC REG in SAS
9.1 (SAS Institute Inc. 2004) for the Tobit
and backward elimination regressions, respec-
tively. We specified a lognormal distribution
for the Tobit regressions, and left 3PBA values
censored at the reported detection limit
(0.07 mg/L) (CDC 2005a, 2005b). Our crite-
rion for statistical significance was p  0.05 for
the regression parameters.
The NHANES data include sample
weights and other design variables ordinarily
used to adjust statistical inferences to represent
the U.S. population. We chose not to apply
these weights or other design adjustments
because we applied numerous exclusion crite-
ria. Further, we were concerned with explor-
ing relationships among urinary 3PBA and
diet/nondiet exposure factors in a convenient
sample rather than generalizing results to the
U.S. population.
Bootstrap simulations. We conducted
bootstrap simulations (Efron 1979) to evaluate
the impact of the model selection procedure on
variability in the regression parameters for the
food predictors. Ordinary confidence intervals
and p-values account for the effects of sample
size given a particular model, but the model
selection procedure adds additional variability.
Because the consumption data for each food
predictor were typically characterized by a large
number of zero values, and a smaller number
of nonzero values depending on the number of
subjects who ate that food, the regression para-
meters may be unduly influenced by outlying
points. The bootstrap approach allows evalua-
tion of whether certain foods remain signifi-
cant predictors if we randomly remove
observations, thus testing the influence of
potentially outlying points. We hypothesized
that foods appearing as significant predictors in
most of the simulated regressions would have a
significant association with urinary 3PBA that
was not simply due to chance.
To create each bootstrapped sample, we
used PROC SURVEYSELECT in SAS 9.1 to
sample n random observations with replace-
ment from the restricted data set, where n is
the restricted sample size (Figure 1). We then
performed the regression procedures described
above on the bootstrapped sample, with one
exception: because we automated the bootstrap
simulations, we did not manually remove pre-
dictors with p-values > 0.20 during step 3. If
 5% of subjects in the child group or 1% in
the teen and adult groups did not eat a particu-
lar food in the bootstrapped sample, we did
not include that food in the step 4 regression.
We repeated this process 5,000 times for each
age group. We constructed box plots of the
bootstrapped regression parameters for food
codes that were significant predictors of urinary
3PBA in the original regressions.
Results
Restricted sample sizes. Figure 1 shows the
final restricted sample sizes by age group and
the number of subjects removed by each
exclusion rule. Final sample sizes for the
child, teen, and adult groups were 179, 603,
and 1,087, respectively. The number of
incomplete observations (i.e., missing data for
one or more predictors) did not exceed 2% of
total observations for any age group. Final
sample sizes were approximately 40% of the
starting sample size, with the exception of the
child group, for which we excluded an addi-
tional 20% of subjects for not meeting the
 8-hr fasting criterion.
Among the restricted samples, we found
no significant difference in 3PBA detection fre-
quencies by age group (Fisher's exact p =
0.1623). However, creatinine-adjusted urinary
3PBA differed significantly (Wilcoxon rank
sum p < 0.0001), with median/95th percentile
values of 0.4/4.8, 0.2/1.6, and 0.3/3.1 ng/mg
creatinine for the child, teen, and adult groups,
respectively. We substituted the detection limit
for below-detection values for all analyses
reported in this section. We did not normalize
urinary 3PBA by creatinine in the regressions.
Model specifications and fit diagnostics.
The screening steps reduced the number of
predictors from 68 (16 nondiet/52 diet) to 17
(1 nondiet/16 diet) in the child group, from
278 (27 nondiet/251 diet) to 84 (5 nondiet/
79 diet) in the teen group, and from 296 (27
nondiet/269 diet) to 93 (15 nondiet/78 diet)
in the adult group. Probability plots of stan-
dardized residuals supported the lognormality
assumptions, whereas plots of standardized
residuals versus predicted 3PBA values showed
even scatter across the range of predicted val-
ues for each group. We evaluated model fit by
comparing the difference between ­2 log like-
lihood for the final fitted model and that of a
reduced model containing the same observa-
tions but only urinary creatinine as a predictor
(creatinine-only model) (Collett 1994). We
tested two other models using the same obser-
vations--one with only nondiet predictors,
the other with only food predictors--against
the creatinine-only model for each age group.
For all groups, all models tested explained sig-
nificantly more of the variability in urinary
3PBA than did the creatinine-only model (i.e.,
chi-square p-values for all tests were < 0.05).
Significant predictors of urinary 3PBA by
age group. Tables 1 and 2 show the regression
parameter estimates and corresponding p-values
for significant predictors of urinary 3PBA in the
child and teen, and adult groups, respectively.

Urinary creatinine (milligrams per deciliter) was
a significant predictor (p < 0.0001) of urinary
3PBA in all three groups. Eight predictors
(including creatinine and the intercept) were
significant in the child model; significant foods
included ground beef, toasted white bread, ice
cream, tortilla chips, cheese, and cookies. In the
teen model, significant predictors of urinary
3PBA included body mass index (BMI), BMI2,
and 21 foods. In the adult model, being an

soft drinks, presweetened instant tea, tortilla
chips, whole wheat bread, and M&Ms peanut
candies had 5th­95th percentile ranges below
zero (Figure 3). In the adult group, foods with
5th­95th percentile bootstrapped  ranges
above zero included bacon, corn puffs/twists,
and endive/chicory/escarole/romaine lettuce;
no adult foods had 5th­95th percentile ranges

Discussion
Statistical significance versus random chance.
Because we compared a large number of pre-
dictors with urinary 3PBA levels, it was reason-
able to expect that spurious associations may
be found due to chance. For example, in a case
where no predictors were associated with a
response variable when we compared 100 pre-
dictors with the response variable using a 5%
cutoff for probability, approximately five pre-
dictors would be expected to display statistical
significance due to chance. If we found a larger
number of predictors (i.e., > 5%), we would be
confident that at least some of the predictors
represented true association rather random
chance. Following this example, in the child,
teen, and adult regressions, we would expect 1,
5, and 5 predictors, respectively, to be signifi-
cant due to chance alone. However, 8 predic-
tors were significant in the child model, 23 in
the teen model, and 21 in the adult model.
This suggests that at least some are indeed pre-
dictors of urinary 3PBA in these groups and
that the associations we see are not all due
purely to chance.
Pesticide use predictors of urinary 3PBA.
Diet and household pesticide use are hypothe-
sized to be major contributors to pyrethroid
body burden in non-occupationally exposed
Americans. In our analyses, diet was a signifi-
cant predictor of urinary 3PBA for all three age
groups. This was not unexpected because one
or more pyrethroids were detected in 52% of
the 260 food items analyzed for pesticides in
the 1999­2001 Total Diet Study by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA 2001).
Reported household pesticide use was not
a significant predictor of urinary 3PBA in any
age group. A possible methodologic explana-
tion for the observed lack of association in the
child and teen models may lie in the fact that
the NHANES interviews were conducted

with proxy respondents for subjects < 16 years
of age, whereas subjects  16 years of age
answered themselves (CDC 2001). The lack
of association could be due to true differences
in pyrethroid use practices and behaviors in
children and teens versus adults. For example,
parents may store pesticides out of reach or
prohibit their children or teens from using
them. Parents of young children may use
fewer pesticides at home. Although we did
not observe a difference in reported indoor
use among the three groups, a greater per-
centage of adult subjects reported using pesti-
cides in the yard (16% vs. 9% and 14% in
the child and teen groups, respectively).
Likewise, the percentage of teen and adult
subjects reporting nonprofessional yard appli-
cations (10­11%) was twice that reporting
professional applications (4­6%), whereas
similar percentages reported nonprofessional
and professional applications in the child
group (4­5%). This may reflect underreport-
ing of yard pesticide use by adult proxy
respondents of child subjects.
The lack of association between reported
household pesticide use and urinary 3PBA in
our child and teen models contradicts the
findings of Lu et al. (2006), although study
design differences limit comparison. Lu et al.
collected 15 consecutive days of urine samples
and asked about household pesticide use dur-
ing the past month. They also administered
their questionnaire on sampling day 1,
whereas the NHANES household pesticide use
questionnaire was administered 1­3 weeks
before sampling. The narrower window of
time between potential exposure and urine col-
lection in the Lu et al. (2006) study may partly
explain the contradictory findings. The mis-
match in ages between Lu et al. (3­11 years of
age) and the restricted NHANES sample
(6­10 years of age) may also help explain the
difference because younger children have been
shown to exhibit greater hand-to-mouth activ-
ity than do older children (Xue et al. 2007),
potentially resulting in higher contaminant
body burdens. It is important to note that Lu
et al. (2006) studied a small cohort of metro-
politan Seattle, Washington (USA) families,
whose pesticide use practices may not be repre-
sentative of other U.S. regions.
In their study of German children, Becker
et al. (2006) found significant associations
between reported indoor pesticide use (yes/no)
and urinary levels of other pyrethroid metabo-
lites but not 3PBA. They did find a significant
association between 3PBA and permethrin
concentrations in house dust, which might be
argued is a more accurate measure of indoor
use than is self-reported use during the previ-
ous month because the half-life of pyrethroids
in dust may be longer than 1 month (Leng
et al. 2005). Nonetheless, Becker et al. cite
three other German studies, across a range of
subject ages, in which the dust­3PBA relation-
ship was not significant.
Other significant nondiet predictors of
urinary 3PBA. Significant nondiet predictors
in the teen model included urinary creatinine
and BMI and their square terms, indicating
possible nonlinear associations between these
predictors and 3PBA. Creatinine and its
square term were also significant in the adult
model, as was active tobacco use. We origi-
nally included tobacco use as a predictor
because of its status as a known CYP450
inducer (Appendix 1). However, we cannot
exclude the possibilities of direct exposures
from tobacco (although most pyrethroids cur-
rently are not registered for use on U.S.
tobacco) or indirect exposures to pyrethroid-
contaminated dust from increased hand-to-
mouth activity potentially associated with
tobacco use.
The occupation variable did not return the
categories we expected to be significant,
namely, farm (NHANES categories farm
operators/managers/supervisors, farm/nursery
workers, and related agricultural/forestry/fish-
ing occupations) and cleaning (NHANES
cleaning/building service occupations cate-
gory) (CDC 2005i). Instead, working in a pri-
vate household or other jobs (a composite of
all other NHANES categories not coded farm,
cleaning, or household) were significantly
associated with lower 3PBA versus not work-
ing (Table 2).
In the adult model, two nondiet predictors
had p-values close to our significance criterion:
reported number of prescription medications
known to inhibit CYP450 used in the past
month ( = 1.7 × 10­1; p = 0.0652), and min-
utes spent gardening in the past month ( =
5.3 × 10­1; p = 0.0613). In the restricted adult
sample, 14%, 3%, and 1% of subjects reported
taking one, two, or three CYP450-inhibiting
prescription drugs, respectively; 41 drugs
inhibiting a range of CYP450 isoforms were
reported. Di Consiglio et al. (2005) demon-
strated with human in vitro preparations that
several organophosphate pesticides inhibit
CYP450-mediated degradation of an antide-
pressant medication, but we were unable to
find studies on the effect of therapeutic drugs
on pesticide metabolism in general, or
pyrethroids specifically. The question of drug
influences on pesticide pharmacokinetics may
be worthy of further exploration. Because only
three of the subjects who reported gardening in
the past month also reported using pesticides,
we did not expect to see any relationship
between gardening activity and urinary 3PBA.
Specific foods driving urinary 3PBA levels
by age group. For all age groups, the regres-
sions produced a greater number of foods that
were significantly associated with urinary
3PBA than might have been expected due to
chance. Further interpretation is complicated
by the fact that the regressions returned foods
with both positive and negative  values. We
find this difficult to explain beyond the simple
argument we outlined in a similar study (Ryan
et al. 2001), namely, that a positive  suggests
that the corresponding food item contained
pyrethroids whereas a negative  suggests the
corresponding food did not contain
pyrethroids and substituted for one that did.
In the present study, we used simple boot-
strap resampling to provide additional insight
into how variance in the NHANES food data
might influence the  estimates. Certain
foods remained significant in a majority
(which we define arbitrarily as 70% or more)
of the bootstrap simulations, suggesting that
the data variability did not affect the contri-
bution of these particular foods in explaining
the variance in urinary 3PBA. These foods
were not always the most frequently con-
sumed, for example, Caesar dressing in the
teen group. Foods that were significant in
70% or more of the simulations and had
5­95th percentile bootstrap  ranges above
zero included ground beef in the child group
and mayonnaise-type salad dressing, bacon,
and Caesar dressing in the teen group. No
foods met the 70% criterion with 5­95th per-
centile  ranges below zero.
Limitations and future research. We did
not apply NHANES sample weights or other
design variables during our analyses, prevent-
ing us from generalizing our results to the U.S.
population. The inclusion of the NHANES
design variables is unlikely to change the
regression coefficients substantially because our
models controlled or stratified by age and race,
two primary characteristics used for oversam-
pling in NHANES. However, incorporation of
the design variables could affect the standard
errors and statistical significance of the predic-
tors (Horton and Fitzmaurice 2004).
Our work demonstrates the limitations of
using large observational data sets like
NHANES for evaluating exposure­biomarker
relationships. We chose an exploratory
approach because the current literature on
pyrethroid exposures and urinary 3PBA is
inconsistent, resulting in many reasonable
a priori hypotheses. From this starting point,
we used a multistep model selection proce-
dure to screen predictors based on p-values.
The dependence of p-values on sample size is
well known, and the large sample sizes espe-
cially in our adult group may have resulted in
a failure to screen out certain foods that were
truly unrelated to 3PBA. We used a bootstrap
approach to evaluate the impact of this model
selection procedure on variability in the
regression parameters for the food predictors.
The bootstrap results presented in Tables 1
and 2 demonstrate how certain foods, even
those eaten relatively frequently in the origi-
nal sample (e.g., lettuce), appear as significant
Riederer et al.
1020 VOLUME 116 | NUMBER 8 | August 2008 · Environmental Health Perspectives
predictors only in a fraction (e.g., lettuce =
42%) of the bootstrapped regressions,
whereas Figures 2­4 demonstrate that the
estimated  values for many foods are not sig-
nificantly different from zero after a large
number of simulations. This illustrates one
potential pitfall associated with drawing con-
clusions from a single regression model of a
large data set with many low-frequency pre-
dictors: slight permutations of the data such
as those achieved by random resampling may
lead to different conclusions.
Another limitation is that we did not test
interactions between certain foods likely to
have been eaten together (e.g., salad dressing
and lettuce) because we did not have adequate
degrees of freedom. Failure to account for
these correlations may produce unstable
regression coefficients that are influenced by
outlying points and may not be readily inter-
pretable for certain combinations of foods
due to the arbitrary partitioning of variance
between them. Additional research is needed
on which foods are most often eaten together
and which foods are likely to contain
pyrethroid residues. Further, we did not dis-
tinguish between foods eaten at home versus
out, although NHANES provided this infor-
mation; this could have biased our results if
more pyrethroids are typically present at one
of these locations. Last, we cannot rule out
the possibility that there were important pre-
dictors of urinary 3PBA that we did not con-
sider simply because they were not included
in NHANES.
Despite these limitations, our results point
toward one practical conclusion and several
interesting hypotheses for future testing. The
practical conclusion is that we did not detect
an association between reported household
pesticide use and urinary 3PBA in the
NHANES data. Future survey directors may
consider collecting more detailed information
about pesticide use events, including dates,
chemical names, and/or application types,
although this would add to subject burden. If
the goal of NHANES is to provide cross-sec-
tional reference values, and not to link expo-
sure factors with biomarker levels, then the
cost of a more detailed pesticide use question-
naire may not be justified.
Future hypotheses to be tested include the
association between urinary 3PBA and con-
sumption of the specific foods with positive 
values in our bootstrap analyses (e.g., ground
beef in the child model). This might be accom-
plished with the current NHANES data by
aggregating the eight-digit food codes into
larger categories (e.g., by grouping all the bacon
codes). However, these associations might be
more efficiently investigated using diet and
3PBA data from ongoing longitudinal studies
(e.g., Lu et al. 2006). Our results are also sug-
gestive of potential interactions between pre-
scription medications and pyrethroid
metabolism, but research characterizing specific
metabolic and interaction pathways in humans
is needed. Interactions between pharmaceuticals
and dietary pesticide metabolism might be
investigated through controlled studies where
matched subjects eat the same foods and differ
only by medication status.
