Abstract
The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) replicates many clinically relevant features of human essential hypertension and
also exhibits behavioral symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and dementia. The SHR phenotype is highly
complex and cannot be explained by a single genetic or physiological mechanism. Nevertheless, numerous studies including
our own work have revealed striking differences in central catecholaminergic transmission in SHR such as increased vesicular
catecholamine content in the ventral brainstem. Here, we used immunolabeling followed by confocal microscopy and elec-
tron microscopy to quantify vesicle sizes and populations across three catecholaminergic brain areas--nucleus tractus
solitarius and rostral ventrolateral medulla, both key regions for cardiovascular control, and the locus coeruleus. We also
studied colocalization of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in norepinephrine and epinephrine-containing neurons as NPY is a common
cotransmitter with central and peripheral catecholamines. We found significantly increased expression and coexpression of
NPY in norepinephrine and epinephrine-positive neurons of locus coeruleus in SHR compared with Wistar rats.
Ultrastructural analysis revealed immunolabeled vesicles of 150 to 650 nm in diameter (means ranging from 250 to
300 nm), which is much larger than previously reported. In locus coeruleus and rostral ventrolateral medulla, but not in
nucleus tractus solitarius, of SHR, noradrenergic and adrenergic vesicles were significantly larger and showed increased NPY
colocalization when compared with Wistar rats. Our morphological evidence underpins the hypothesis of hyperactivity of
the noradrenergic and adrenergic system and increased norepinephrine and epinephrine and NPY cotransmission in specific
brain areas in SHR. It further strengthens the argument for a prohypertensive role of C1 neurons in the rostral ventrolateral
medulla as a potential causative factor for essential hypertension.

Introduction
Central norepinephrine and epinephrine (N/E) are impli-
cated in the regulation of a wide variety of vital brain
functions in context of cognitive and emotional process-
ing and of autonomic homeostasis. Several groups of
noradrenergic and adrenergic (N/E-ergic) neurons, with
cell bodies located in the brainstem and pons, project
their axonal processes throughout the entire central ner-
vous system (CNS; Moore and Bloom, 1979; Fillenz,
1990).

The largest and most densely packaged N/E-ergic cell
group, the pontine area A6 or locus coeruleus (LC), pro-
vides the majority of N/E-ergic input to the forebrain,
including hippocampus and cortex. The LC is associated
with the control of higher central functions such as atten-
tion and vigilance, memory, decision making, and pain
perception (Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005; Sara, 2009;
Carter et al., 2010; Ossipov et al., 2010; O'Donnell
et al., 2012).
Brainstem N/E-ergic groups, in contrast, project pre-
dominantly to areas in midbrain, spinal cord, and within
the brainstem and pons. These groups play important
roles in autonomic regulation, control of energy homeo-
stasis, and the hypothalamo-pituitary axis (Reis et al.,
1984; Inoue et al., 2013). The A2 group of N/E-ergic
neurons is located in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS)
at the dorsomedial surface of the medulla oblongata and
innervates hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, amyg-
dala, and various brainstem areas, including the rostral
ventrolateral medulla (RVLM; Sawchenko and Swanson,
1982; Herbert and Saper, 1992; Aicher et al., 1996; Smith
and Aston-Jones, 2008; reviewed in Rinaman, 2011). The
role of the NTS in cardiovascular regulation is well docu-
mented, and A2 neurons contribute to this function
(Talman et al., 1980; Colombari et al., 2001; Duale
et al., 2007; Kasparov and Teschemacher, 2008). The
adrenergic C1 neurons in the RVLM innervate nuclei in
the pons and diencephalon and also the thoracic spinal
cord (Ross et al., 1984a; Milner et al., 1989; Verberne
et al., 1999; Card et al., 2006). C1 activity is essential
for regulation of autonomic and cardiovascular func-
tions, and altered signaling within RVLM contributes
to neurogenic hypertension and progression of heart fail-
ure (Ross et al., 1984b; Colombari et al., 2001; Guyenet,
2006; Kasparov and Teschemacher, 2008; Marina et al.,
2013). Recent experiments with optogenetic activation of
C1 neurones in the RVLM have further implicated this
cell group in a variety of other physiological processes
including arousal and breathing (Burke et al., 2014;
Abbott et al., 2014).
Cotransmission is a common feature of peripheral and
central N/E-ergic neurons (Teschemacher and Johnson,
2009). For example, although C1 neurons in the RVLM
synthesize and release catecholamines, these neurons are
also equipped with the machinery for glutamatergic sig-
naling (Teschemacher et al., 2008; Burke et al., 2014;
Abbott et al., 2014). In addition, many studies have
documented that, in the periphery as well as in the
brain, N/E-ergic neurones frequently coexpress neuro-
peptide Y (NPY; Lundberg et al., 1982, 1983; Everitt
et al., 1984; Sawchenko et al., 1985; Holets et al.,
1988; Wilcox and Unnerstall, 1990; Zardetto-Smith and
Gray, 1995). Moreover, it is well established that NPY
can be coreleased with N/E in the periphery (Lundberg
et al., 1986; Pernow, 1988; De Potter et al., 1997;
Johnson, 2010) and that cotransmission modulates N/E
signaling in context of blood pressure control (Chalmers
et al., 1989; Zukowska-Grojec et al., 1993; Shanks and
Herring, 2013). A mouse model in which NPY is over-
expressed in N/E neurones globally has elevated sympa-
thetic activity and is prone to stress-induced
hypertension, supporting the idea that NPY contained
within N/E-ergic fibers plays a role in sympathetic drive
(Ruohonen et al., 2009). Within the CNS, NPY also
influences cardiovascular regulation, but the effects are
mediated via multiple pathways and may be sympatho-
excitatory or -inhibitory, depending on the brain area
NPY is acting upon (Vallejo and Lightman, 1986; Fuxe
et al., 1987; Fuxe et al., 1990). A clear example for cen-
tral N/E­NPY cotransmission was demonstrated in a
study where the RVLM was stimulated, causing not
only an increase in blood pressure via the descending
excitation of spinal preganglionic sympathetic neurons
but also release of NPY immunoreactivity into the sub-
arachnoid space (Morris et al., 1987).
There is a consensus that N/E in the brain are predom-
inantly released from nonjunctional varicosities and
modulate regional circuitry via volume transmission
(O'Donnell et al., 2012). An increasing body of evidence
supports the idea that astrocytes are a primary target for
central N/E release and essential for mediating modula-
tion of synaptic transmission in healthy brain function
(Hertz et al., 2004; Pankratov and Lalo, 2015). The
volume transmission mode calls for N/E storage in
large dense core vesicles (LDCV) located outside of pre-
synaptic zones (Trueta and De-Miguel, 2012). Although
previous electron microscopic (EM) studies ascribed two
distinct vesicle populations to central N/E-ergic neurons,
small clear vesicles (diameter range 40­60 nm) and LDCV
(80­120 nm), the evidence for functional N/E storage
indeed appeared stronger for the LDCV population
(Bloom and Aghajanian, 1968; Pickel et al., 1989;
Nirenberg et al., 1995). The first direct evidence that
this type of release actually exists in the brain came
from our microamperometric recordings, which demon-
strated rare but very large quantal release events in cen-
tral N/E-ergic neurons (Chiti and Teschemacher, 2007),
which could not be easily explained by the earlier EM
observations. However, a comparative and quantitative
analysis of N/E-containing vesicular populations across
several N/E-ergic nuclei of the brain has never been per-
formed. Moreover, it was never tested whether a patho-
logical phenotype associated with altered central N/E-
ergic transmission may be associated with ultrastructural
changes in the N/E-ergic vesicular populations.
An obvious pathology to focus on in the context of
increased central N/E activity is neurogenic hypertension.
We therefore chose to draw comparisons between a con-
trol rat model, the Wistar rat (WR) and the spontan-
eously hypertensive rat (SHR), which shows a complex
2 ASN Neuro
phenotype consistent with overactivity/overreactivity in
central N/E transmission. Not only is this strain a com-
monly used model for studying essential hypertension
(Frohlich, 1986; Kasparov and Teschemacher, 2008; Xu
et al., 2012), but it also carries traits consistent with fea-
tures of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD;
Sagvolden, 2000; Sontag et al., 2013) and vascular
dementia (Sabbatini et al., 2002). Using microampero-
metry, we demonstrated earlier that in SHR, there is a
major shift toward much larger N/E quantal release
events in the RVLM, but up to now there was no
known morphological correlate for these surprisingly
large release events.
Given the paucity of information about the types of
N/E-containing vesicles in the brain and their costorage
of NPY, we decided to undertake an EM study using
more advanced methods of tissue fixation and immunola-
beling, which have been developed specifically by others
and ourselves to preserve fragile vesicular structures
(McDonald et al., 2007; Verkade, 2008). We performed
immuno-gold labeling of dopamine-b-hydroxylase (DbH)
and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) with
validated antibodies at the ultrastructural level. By com-
bining light fluorescent microscopy and EM, we have
obtained by far the greatest sample of measurements of
N/E-ergic vesicles in mammalian CNS to date. The aim of
the current study was twofold. Our first objective was to
map NPY coexpression in central N/E-rgic neurons rele-
vant to hypertension and ADHD, based on three of the
most relevant N/E-ergic groups: A6 in the LC, A2 in
the NTS, and C1 in the RVLM. Second, we intended to
carefully evaluate the N/E containing vesicular structures
in these groups, in order to get a clear view of their sizes
and NPY content and any differences between the WR
and the SHR strains.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Animal experiments were carried out in accordance
with the U.K. Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986,
consistent with the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals published by the U.S. National
Institutes of Health (NIH Publication, 8th Edition,
2011), and approved by the University of Bristol
Ethical Review Group (UB/05/035). Animals were
group-housed an enriched environment under a
standard 12-hr light/dark cycle, with free access to food
and water. Experiments were conducted in nine adult
male WR and SHR each (250­310 g, Harlan
Laboratories, UK), with three animals of each strain allo-
cated to confocal microscopy and, to EM analysis, three
animals each for brainstem preparations and for LC,
respectively.
Immuno-Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy
Animals were terminally anesthetized using pentobarbital
(400 mg/kg i.p.) and perfusion-fixed transcardially with
4% paraformaldehyde. Sections of 40 lm were prepared
from the brainstem and pons regions on a freezing micro-
tome. Free floating sections (40 lm) were placed in block-
ing solution for 1 to 2 hr (3% goat serum; 1­2% bovine
serum albumin (BSA); 0.1% phosphate buffered solution
[PBS]-Triton X-100) at room temperature and subse-
quently incubated with primary antibodies (1:200 DbH
rabbit polyclonal, Abcam AB43868; 1:400 NPY mouse
monoclonal, kind gift of Dr. Grouzmann, Lausanne) in
the blocking solution for 16 to 24 hr.
The DbH antiserum was previously characterized in
Western blots, as well as by immunohistochemistry stu-
dies, where it selectively labeled N/E-ergic neurons,
and, at a subcellular level, both secretory vesicle lumen
and vesicle membranes (Nosjean et al., 2002; Fortune
and Lurie, 2009; Polanski et al., 2010). In our hands, it
also reliably labeled central N/E-ergic neurons in all
established locations. The NPY antiserum provided by
Dr. Grouzmann belongs to the immunoglobulin G1 sub-
class with high affinity to the 11 to 24 amino acid epitope
region and with no cross-reactivity for peptide YY and
pancreatic polypeptide (Grouzmann et al., 1992).
Sections were then incubated in Alexa Fluor anti-
rabbit-594 (Invitrogen) and Biotin anti-mouse (Vector),
followed by Streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-
body (Invitrogen) for 1 to 2 hr, respectively. Negative con-
trols were performed by omitting the primary antibody.
FluorSave (CalBiochem) was used to mount sections.
Fluorescent images were acquired with a confocal laser
scanning microscope (Leica SP1, Leica Microsystems,
Wetzlar, Germany). For each animal, approximately 66
brainstem sections containing NTS (44 rostral and 22
caudal, relative to the area postrema), 40 sections for
caudal ventrolateral medulla, 33 sections for RVLM,
and 20 pontine sections containing LC were evaluated.
AVV Transduction
Tissue for EM processing was selected from N/E-ergic
neuron-dense areas in NTS, RVLM, and LC, which
were preselected by specific expression of enhanced
green fluorescent protein under the control of the
PRSÂ8 promoter using adenoviral vector (AVV) trans-
genesis (Hwang et al., 2001; Lonergan et al., 2005;
Teschemacher et al., 2005). The approach has the advan-
tage of labeling living neurones, allowing us to rapidly
localize and preselect N/E-ergic areas for EM sample
preparation. This procedure minimized pre-EM tissue
damage and profoundly increased our data collection effi-
ciency, thus yielding sufficiently large sample sizes to
carry out quantitative analysis. Diameters of control
Kourtesis et al. 3
vesicles detected in untransduced tissue were consistent
with the peak range in transduced brains. Transgenic
expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein in neu-
rons is a widely used approach, and this AVV has been
extensively characterized by us and others and causes no
appreciable changes in central N/E-ergic transmission
(Lonergan et al., 2005; Teschemacher et al., 2005;
Teschemacher et al., 2008; Abbott et al., 2009). For
viral vector injection, animals were anesthetized with
ketamine/medetomidine (60/250 mg/kg, i.m.) and pos-
itioned in a stereotaxic frame. Core temperature was
maintained at 37 C. AVV was injected at a titer of 1010
TU/ml, 0.5 ll per site injection, at a rate of 0.5 ml/min.
For the NTS, three bilateral microinjections of AVV were
made along the length of the NTS at bregma À14.30,
À14.60, and À13.80. For the RVLM, a unilateral injec-
tion of AVV was performed at bregma between
À11.3 mm and À12.3 mm. In the LC, four unilateral
AVV injections were placed at bregma À9.2 mm,
À9.7 mm, À10 mm, and À10.5 mm. At the end of surgery,
anesthesia was reversed with atipamezole (1 mg/kg).
Electron Microscopy Sample Preparation
A combination of perfusion- and cryo-fixation with resin
embedding was used to achieve an optimized balance
between high labeling efficiency as obtained by the
Tokuyasu cryo immuno-gold labeling technique and ultra-
structural visualization as obtained by standard Epon
embedding (van Lookeren et al., 1991; Verkade et al.,
1995). Twelve to fifteen days following AVV transduction,
the animals were sacrificed with an overdose of pentobar-
bital (400mg/kg, i.p.) and perfusion-fixed transcardially
with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brain sections of
200 mm were sliced with a vibratome (Camden
Instruments, Loughborough, UK), and green fluorescent
N/E-ergic cells were identified under a fluorescence micro-
scope (Leica DM IL LED; Leica Microsystems). A tissue
puncher (Leica) was used to extract 1-mm circular tissue
blocks that were incubated in cryoprotectant (20% bovine
serum albumin, 100 mM trehalose in PBS), loaded into a
0.2-mm deep carbon-coated membrane carrier (Leica
Microsystems), and subjected to (virtually instantaneous)
high pressure freezing (EM PACT2 þ RTS; Leica
Microsystems; Verkade, 2008). Samples were subsequently
freeze-substituted (AFS2 þ FSP, Leica Microsystems) and
embedded in Lowicryl HM20 as previously described (van
Weering et al., 2010). Ultrathin 100-nm sections were
sliced (Reichert Ultracut E) and placed on Pioloform-
coated copper slot grids (2Â 1 mm; Agar).
Ultrastructural Immuno-Gold Labeling
Grids were placed on 100 mM glycine in PBS to quench
aldehyde and then in 0.1% BSA-cTM (Aurion,
Wageningen, the Netherlands) in PBS (blocking solu-
tion). This was followed by incubation of alternating sec-
tions in primary antibodies of either of the two N/E-ergic
markers, DbH (1:20 rabbit polyclonal; Abcam, see ear-
lier) or VMAT2 (1:40 rabbit polyclonal; Millipore
AB1598P) and NPY (1:40 mouse monoclonal; kind gift
of Dr. Grouzmann as described earlier), in blocking solu-
tion for 1 hr. The specificity of the VMAT2 antiserum
(rabbit polyclonal; Millipore AB1598P) had been previ-
ously established by multiple Western blot and immuno-
histochemistry studies, including subcellular distribution
using electron microscopy (Liu et al., 1994; Peter et al.,
1995; Nirenberg et al., 1995). The specificity was con-
firmed by substitution of the primary antibody with non-
immune serum or by preadsorption of the primary
antibody with the peptide antigen. In our study, the anti-
serum labeled the membrane of LDCV, following a pat-
tern consistent with DbH immunolabeling and in an
identical pattern to that described by previous work in
both rat brain tissue and the adrenal gland (Peter et al.,
1995).
Sections were subsequently labeled with secondary
antibodies (10-nm colloidal gold donkey antirabbit for
DbH/VMAT2 and 15-nm colloidal gold goat antimouse
for NPY; Aurion) in blocking solution for 45 to 60 min.
Sections were then counterstained in 3% uranyl acetate
and lead citrate. Images of the ultrastructure and
immuno-gold labeling were acquired on a Tecnai12
Biotwin transmission electron microscope equipped with
a bottom-mount 4 Â 4k CCD camera (FEI company,
Eindhoven, the Netherlands). Immunolabeling was opti-
mized to achieve efficient labeling of N/E-ergic vesicles
while minimizing nonspecific gold staining, which was
confirmed by the absence of gold particles from structures
renowned for background labeling, such as nuclei, mito-
chondria, and myelin sheaths. Negative controls were
performed by omitting primary antibodies, which
resulted in the absence of gold labeling in all brain
areas examined.
EM image analysis was performed on four to six sec-
tions per resin block per rat (n ¼ 3) for each brain region.
This approach yielded statistically significant outcomes
and allowed consistent random sampling of the ultra-
structure and antigenicity representative for each investi-
gated brain region. The horizontal and vertical radii of
vesicles were measured in Fiji/ImageJ, and they were
averaged for the purpose of further evaluation. DbH
and VMAT2 labeling appeared in a consistent pattern
of dense core vesicles, with VMAT2 labels observed asso-
ciated with vesicular membranes and DbH labeling seen
at either membrane or lumen of the vesicle. The size dis-
tributions and number of vesicles labeled by the two mar-
kers were alike and thus pooled for analysis.
Statistical difference between vesicle distributions
belonging to different brain areas in either WR of SHR
4 ASN Neuro
was studied by application of the two-sample
Kolmogorov­Smirnov (KS) test (http://www.physics.
csbsju.edu/stats/KS-test.n.plot_form.html).
Mathematical Model for Extrapolation of Imaging
Data to Vesicle Population Distribution
To reconstruct distributions of real vesicle diam-
eters based on our imaged sections, we used a mathem-
atical model based on weighted contributions of
randomly sectioned coexisting subpopulations of spher-
ical objects.
Sectioning of a sphere-like object results in discs of a
range of diameters, from 0 at its base and apex, to the
true diameter through the center of the sphere
(Figure 1(a)). In a more complex setting, if multiple
spheres of different sizes are sectioned simultaneously,
any but the largest resulting disc may stem from a smaller
sphere, cut closer to its center, or from a larger sphere,
cut at a level more distant from its center. EM image
analysis yields cross sections of such a heterogeneous
population of sphere-like vesicles at random levels, occa-
sionally including sections through their largest diameter
at their centers. Therefore, analysis of vesicle sections
underestimates the true vesicle diameters and skews the
size distributions leftward (Figure 1(b)).
To estimate the real vesicle diameter distribution in
our study, we modelled the overall vesicle size distribu-
tion using the weighted contributions of coexisting vesicle
subpopulations, optimizing the weighting by least-
squares linear regression to fit the observed data. With
equal probability of optical sectioning of a vesicle at any
level, from base through center to apex, we assumed
equal distribution of sin (f) between À1 and þ1
(Figure 1(a)). The resulting diameters of each section
then correspond to 2 Â cos (f) scaled to the true vesicle
diameter (D) as obtained through sectioning the vesicle
center. For any given vesicle population with a uniform
diameter, EM imaging is therefore predicted to yield a
distribution of optical cross sections, which is negatively
skewed with a maximum bin corresponding to the true
vesicle diameter (Figure 1(b)). We used a template which
assumes that all vesicles are optically sectioned with equal
probability at 1-nm distances and which incorporates ves-
icle groups from 0 to 700 nm, in 25-nm-wide bins
(Figure 1(b) to (e)). By weighting the contributions of
each vesicle size group, we simulated a distribution that
correlated well (linear regression R2 > .95) with our raw
data (Figure 1(e)). The solution of the problem closely
resembles the approach described by Wicksell (1925) and
is applicable to a size range of below one order of mag-
nitude as in the present study. This simple approach may
be easily followed using widely available spreadsheet soft-
ware (e.g., Microsoft Excel; see Online Supplemental
Material).
Results
DbH and NPY Expression and Coexpression at Light
Microscope (Cellular) Level
Confocal imaging of WR as well as SHR brain sections
revealed that the majority of neuropeptide Y releasing
(NPY-expressing) neurons across all investigated N/E-
ergic cell groups coexpress DbH. Viewed from the other
perspective, the majority of N/E-ergic cell bodies in ros-
tral NTS (A2 neurons), caudal ventrolateral medulla (A1
neurons), and RVLM (C1 neurones) coexpressed NPY
(Figure 2(a) to (c), (e)). In contrast, the caudal part of
the NTS contained more N/E-ergic and fewer NPY-ergic
cells as compared with the rostral NTS (Figure 2(c)),
resulting in a lower degree of colocalization in both rat
strains (caudal 14.0 Æ 1.0% versus rostral 95.1 Æ 2.4% for
WR; 14.4 Æ 1.2% vs. 96.4 Æ 0.8% for SHR; Figure 2(e)).
In the LC, the area with the highest density of N/E-
ergic neurons, only partial colocalization of N/E with
NPY was found (Figure 2(c)). Here, a significant differ-
ence was observed between WR and SHR. Although the
number of DbH-expressing cells was similar (Figure
2(d)), NPY-positive cells were much more abundant in
SHR (34.3 Æ 5.0% vs. 17.1 Æ 1.6% in WR; p < .001),
leading to a higher degree of DbH-NPY colocalization
(33.5 Æ 4.7% in SHR vs. 16.6 Æ 1.8% in WR; p ¼ .015;
Figure 2).
Evidence of Preservation of Ultrastructure and
Antigenicity of N/E-ergic Vesicles in EM Samples
The EM approach employed in this study was optimized
for the best compromise between preservation of ultra-
structure and antigenicity of tissue from NTS, RVLM,
and LC. Dehydration issues appeared to be minimal,
based on the insignificant cytosolic extraction, and freez-
ing artifacts were also, in general, absent as indicated by
the intact appearance of nuclei, the delineation and struc-
tural integrity of the nuclear, vesicular, and plasma mem-
branes, and preservation of myelin sheaths (Figure 3;
Brown et al., 2009). Organelles such as the endoplasmic
reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi, mitochondria, multivesicu-
lar bodies, and individual synapses were easily recognized
(Figure 3). Small clear vesicles sections of 40 to 60 nm
diameter and LDCV sections of over 80 nm and varying
electron opacity were clearly identifiable (Figure 3).
LDCV were spherical or slightly ellipsoid, with a trend
to deviation from spherical shape in the larger vesicles
(Figure 3(d) to (f)). Antigenicity was well maintained as
confirmed by immunolabeling with colloidal gold par-
ticles for DbH and VMAT2 (10 nm gold) and NPY
(15 nm gold); small clear vesicles and most dense core
vesicles of diameters under 120 nm were unlabeled
(Figures 3 and 4). Labeled LDCV were found in peri-
karya, as well as putative dendrites, putative varicosities,

peripheral portions of cytoplasm and in dendritic and
axonal compartments, typically remote from any
synapse-like structures (Figures 3 and 4).
Comparative EM Analysis of N/E-ergic Vesicles in
WR and SHR
Across all N/E-ergic brain areas imaged in this study,
labeled LDCV sections measured diameters in the range
of 70 to 650 nm, with only 2.5% of the population smaller
than 120 nm (Figures 4 and 5(a)). In WR, the distribution
of LDCV diameters peaked over the 200 to 225 nm range
and was skewed toward the right, with mean and median
of 235 and 223 nm, respectively (Figure 5(a)). In SHR, the
distribution of N/E-ergic LDCV was shifted to the right
and appeared bimodal, with peaks in 250 to 275 nm and
the 375 to 400 nm ranges; the mean diameter overall was
317 nm and the median 306 nm (Figure 5(a)). These meas-
urements are consistent with markedly larger sizes of cen-
tral N/E-ergic LDCV than had been reported by earlier
studies.
Detailed analysis revealed significant area-specific dif-
ferences in LDCV section sizes. While NTS and RVLM
populations in WR were not significantly different from
one another and were strongly right skewed, both differed
significantly from the more normally distributed LC
population (Figure 5(b)). In SHR, the RVLM contained
a population of N/E-ergic LDCV, which was significantly
larger than that in NTS but significantly smaller than that
found in LC (Figure 5(c)).
In the NTS, N/E-ergic vesicle populations were not
different between WR and SHR (Figure 6(a), left and
6(d)). However, in RVLM as well as LC, SHR tissue
contained larger vesicles (Figure 6(a), middle and right,
(e), and (f)). The distribution of diameters of NPY-
positive LDCV was not significantly different to what
was found for N/E-labeled LDCV in the corresponding
N/E-ergic sections (Figure 6(a) and (b)). However, the
number of NPY-positive vesicles appeared higher in the
RVLM of SHR as compared with WR. Thus, the signifi-
cant differences between WR and SHR in RVLM and
LC, as described earlier for N/E-ergic LDCV, also held
for NPY-labeled vesicle sections (Figure 6(b)) and for the
subpopulation of vesicles colabeled for N/E and NPY
(Figure 6(c) to (f)). These data suggest a significant
increase in N/E-ergic vesicle size and in the frequency
of colocalization with NPY in RVLM and LC of SHR.
Reconstruction of Vesicle Size Distributions by
Correction for Eccentric Optical Sectioning and
Estimation of Intravesicular N/E Concentration
Sectioning of cell organelles occurs at random and there-
fore diameter measurements based on EM images of the
vesicles will underestimate their true diameters and vol-
umes. Using our mathematical model (see Methods sec-
tion, Figure 1), we simulated the distribution of the true
diameters of vesicles from which the EM image measure-
ments were taken. The model weights the contribution of
differently sized vesicle groups to the total population and
predicts the resulting distribution of optical sections. We
assumed a mixed population of different sized vesicles
and weighted each size group individually to optimize
the correlation between EM data distribution curves
and simulated data.
This analysis suggested that across the three brain
areas investigated, in WR, 57% of labeled N/E-ergic ves-
icles were in the 150 to 250 nm diameter range, 35%
measured between 250 and 350 nm, and 8% belonged
to a population of over 350 nm and up to 550 nm
(Figure 7(a)).
In SHR, only 20% of N/E-ergic vesicles belonged to
the 150 to 250 nm diameter range, 30% were between 250
and 350 nm in diameter, 33% belonged to the 350 to
450 nm range, and 17% were even larger than 450 nm
(Figure 7(a)). Therefore, large vesicles were much more
abundant in SHR.
When applying the regression model to the different
N/E-ergic brain areas separately, the resulting true vesicle
distributions retained the overall shape of the vesicle
image distributions (Figure 5), but, as expected, the
peaks were slightly right shifted as vesicles were now
represented by their maximal diameters rather than off-
centered, smaller cross sections. Smaller diameter
(<150 nm) vesicles were no longer represented in the
randomly from a uniform population of vesicles with D ¼ 500 nm. (c) Distribution of optical sections (apparent vesicle diameters) taken
randomly from coexisting, equally contributing, subpopulations of vesicles of diameters ranging from 25 to 650 nm. This distribution serves
as basis for simulated data: By adjusting the relative contributions of different vesicle size groups, the overall shape of the histogram can be
developed to match experimental data. (d) Simulation of the normalized distribution of optical sections (apparent vesicle diameters) taken

true distributions (Figure 7(a) and (b)). In WR, major
population peaks became apparent at 175 to 200 nm in
NTS, 200 to 225 nm in RVLM, and 250 to 275 nm in LC,
with additional minor peaks for NTS at 400 to 425 nm
and 325 to 350 nm for RVLM (Figure 7(b)). Distributions
in SHR were not only shifted to larger diameter
ranges but were also broader and showed multiple
peaks (Figure 7(c)).
These observations consistently suggest that, in the
SHR, there is area-specific reorganization of catechol-
amine packaging in a way, which would favor release of
large transmitter quantities upon individual fusion
events.
Discussion
In this study, we combined EM with confocal imaging
and mathematical modeling to characterize central N/E-
containing vesicles at a new level of precision. Our new
data help to explain how central N/E neurons operate in
the volume transmission mode. We also mapped central
coexpression and colocalization of N/E and NPY at cel-
lular and vesicular levels. To investigate the cross-links
between central N/E-ergic and NPY-ergic transmission,
control of blood pressure, and modulation of impulsivity,
we compared these transmitter systems between WR and
SHR, a genetic rat model with altered catecholaminergic
transmission.
At cellular level, we found considerable but area-
specific overlap between N/E-ergic and NPY-ergic
systems and differences in colocalization in the LC of
the SHR. At the ultrastructural level, we established a
clear morphological correlate for the previously detected
extra large quantal N/E release events and revealed that
in SHR, there are many more large LDCV in the pre-
sympathetic C1 area and in the A6 group, which is likely
to affect the physiological consequences and cellular tar-
gets of these central modulator systems. This analysis has
been made possible by the combination of the advanced
cryo-preservation methods used here with the greatly
increased probability of locating N/E processes in the
tissue by fluorescence microscopy prescreening.
Remarkably, we found specifically labeled N/E-ergic
vesicles with diameters above 150 nm and up to 650 nm
with population peaks around 200 to 300 nm and 250 to
400 nm for WR and SHR, respectively. This size range is
considerably larger than documented by previous litera-
ture for the brain, although comparable to adrenal chro-
maffin granules, and consistent with volume
transmission, particularly as their location was invariably
remote from synapse-like structures. Quantal content of
catecholaminergic vesicles is related to their volume
(Colliver et al., 2000), and large quanta, once released,
are more likely to saturate local transport/reuptake mech-
anisms and allow farther diffusion of N/E to reach more
remote and a wider range of target cells. Previous work
from our own group for the first time described central
exocytotic N/E release and measured quantal sizes using
amperometry in explants from rat brainstem of young
rats (Chiti and Teschemacher, 2007; Teschemacher
et al., 2008). The majority of exocytotic events released
around 105 molecules of N/E per quantum but larger
events ranging up to 107 N/E molecules were detected.
If we assume similar vesicle anatomy in young and adult
rats (as used in the present study), our current findings
put us in the position to estimate vesicular volumes, cor-
relate them with quantal size, and thus suggest intravesi-
cular N/E concentrations of around 10 mM in NTS and
RVLM.
Earlier studies appear to have overlooked large-sized
vesicle populations, potentially due to use of detergents
and resulting diffuse reaction products that may have
limited the spatial resolution and accurate distinction
between adjacent vesicles. On the other hand, we may,
to some extent, have underestimated and biased against
the populations below 150 nm in diameter because we
optimized our labeling procedure to enhance specificity
at the cost of labeling density. Indeed, when comparing
vesicle imaging data with simulated true LDCV diam-
eters, actual detected N/E-ergic vesicles were found less
frequent in the lower range of bins up to 100 nm than our
model predicted (Figure 1(e)).
Despite the obvious similarities, such as their overall
cellular morphology and their ability to synthesize

release. We hypothesize that changes in these parameters
may correlate with described functional deficits in the
SHR. A potential driver for vesicle enlargement in SHR
may be the upregulated expression of intravesicular N/E-
chelating proteins such as chromogranin A (O'Connor
et al., 1999).
Interestingly, N/E-ergic vesicles in LC were larger than
in other inspected areas in both, WR and SHR, but in
SHR the shift toward larger sizes was particularly dra-
matic. A parallel shift to larger diameters was seen for
NPY-labeled vesicles in SHR. The fraction of N/E-NPY
colocalizing vesicles was increased from 41% in WR to
54% in SHR, whereby in both rat strains, the NPY-cola-
beling was found in the larger of N/E-ergic vesicles. While
it is still under debate whether the symptoms of ADHD
represent hyper- or hypofunction of the central N/E-ergic
system, it is generally accepted that an optimum N/E-
ergic tone in the prefrontal cortex is required for ade-
quate executive function, where release must be counter-
balanced by uptake transporter activity (Russell and
Wiggins, 2000; Heal et al., 2008; Prince, 2008; Howells
et al., 2012). Conversely, an unbalanced NPY-ergic
system has been implicated as potential causative factor
in ADHD (Lesch et al., 2011; Bari et al., 2015), and sig-
nificant changes in NPY expression levels across different
brain areas have been reported in SHR (Maccarrone and
Jarrott, 1985). Our data are consistent with N/E-ergic
and NPY-ergic hyperactivity and increased turnover in
the forebrain where N/E-ergic axons from the LC project
(Russell, 2002; Imeraj et al., 2012).

The other area where significantly larger vesicles con-
taining N/E, NPY, or both transmitters were detected in
SHR was the presympathetic C1 group in the RVLM.
Here, the fraction of costoring vesicles doubled (from
24% to 49%). Overall expression and coexpression of
N/E and NPY in the RVLM were, however, not different
at the light microscopic level, indicating that the same
neuronal population has increased transmitter levels
and cotransmission in the hypertensive strain.
Importantly, the increased vesicle sizes in SHR are in
agreement with larger quantal sizes, which we observed
in amperometric recordings from prehypertensive RVLM
tissue (Teschemacher et al., 2008). This, in turn, is
expected to result in an increase of the impact and
range of signaling in SHR and may anatomically under-
pin the prohypertensive function of C1 activity as a

potential driver of neurogenic hypertension (Colombari
et al., 2001; Kasparov and Teschemacher, 2008; Abbott
et al., 2012).
In the NTS, at cellular resolution, no significant dif-
ferences in numbers of neurons expressing N/E or NPY,
nor in N/E-NPY colocalization levels were observed
between WR and SHR. This lack of difference between
rat strains was reflected in similar size distributions of
N/E-ergic and NPY-ergic vesicles, and an only modest
increase in colocalization of both transmitters in N/E-
ergic vesicles from 24% in WR to 32% in SHR.
Therefore, for A2 neurons in the NTS, the morphological
evidence is also in agreement with earlier amperometric ana-
lysis from our group, which had suggested a comparable
range of quantal N/E-ergic release events in young prehy-
pertensive WR and SHR (Teschemacher et al., 2008).
While a large body of previous work and our own
study provide clear functional links between signaling
mediated by N/E and NPY, the exact nature of this inter-
action is still elusive. As NPY activates several types of
Gi
-protein-coupled receptors which may be located pre-
or postsynaptically with respect to N/E-ergic neurons
or their axonal projections, predictably, the effects of
cotransmission are complex and area specific (Gehlert,
2004). In addition, nonneuronal brain cells must be
taken into account as, according to recently published
transcriptomes of mouse forebrain, astrocytes express
predominantly b1-, and also a1- and a2-adrenoceptors
and Y1 receptors at lower levels (Cahoy et al., 2008;
Zhang et al., 2014). Clues on the functional impact of
NPY cotransmission can be gained from studies that
have applied NPY into N/E-ergic brain areas or sites
receiving N/E-ergic input. For example, in the LC, Y2
receptor activation enhances N/E-ergic signaling and is
implicated in anxiolytic actions, while Y1 receptors
appear to counteract Y2 actions (Illes et al., 1993;
Kask et al., 1998). Regarding cardiovascular regulation,
NPY within the RVLM as well as NTS was shown to
modulate blood pressure differentially via antagonistic
actions of Y1 and a2-adrenoceptors or of Y1 and Y2
receptors (Diaz-Cabiale et al., 2007). Interestingly, simi-
lar to N/E, NPY also acts on astrocytes where it induces
glycogenolysis (Sorg and Magistretti, 1991), which will
inevitably lead to release of L-lactate. The recent discov-
ery of a signaling role for L-lactate in the brain possibly
opens a new avenue here, as it seems feasible that the
larger vesicles in SHR with higher NPY content would
allow more effective recruitment of astrocytes by chem-
ical signals released by N/E-ergic cells (Tang et al., 2014).
We believe that this interaction needs to be studied fur-
ther in order to clarify how a shift in the vesicular content
of N/E or NPY affects the signaling between N/E-ergic
fibers and their downstream targets.
In summary, we have performed extensive quantitative
analysis of central N/E-containing vesicles and
colocalization between N/E and NPY at light and EM
level. This has allowed us to draw a numerically repre-
sentative comparison between WR and SHR, a widely
used model for essential hypertension and ADHD.
Changes which were detected in the SHR are consistent
with the notion of altered catecholaminergic signaling
and suggest that area-specific aberrant transmitter release
mechanisms reflect the specific neurological and behav-
ioral phenotype of SHR.
Summary
In an animal model for hypertension and attention-defcit/
hyperactivity disorder, the storage compartments
containing adrenaline-like signaling molecules were sig-
nificantly larger in specific brain areas and contained
more of the chemical comessenger, neuropeptide Y, sug-
gesting an extended and altered signaling range.
