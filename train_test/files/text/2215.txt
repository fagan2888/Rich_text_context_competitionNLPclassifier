b Background: Assessing mediation is important because most interventions are de-
signed to affect an intermediate variable or mediator; this mediator, in turn, is hy-
pothesized to affect outcome behaviors. Although there may be randomization to the
intervention, randomization to levels of the mediator is not generally possible. There-
fore, drawing causal inferences about the effect of the mediator on the outcome is
not straightforward.
b Objectives: The aim of this study was to introduce an approach to causal mediation
analysis using the potential outcomes framework for causal inference and then dis-
cuss this approach in terms of the scientific questions addressed and the assumptions
needed for identifying and estimating the effects.
b Methods: The approach is illustrated using data from the Criminal Justice Drug Abuse
Treatment Studies: Reducing Risky Relationships-HIV intervention implemented
with 243 incarcerated women re-entering the community. The intervention was
designed to affect various mediators at 30 days postintervention, including risky
relationship thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes, which were then hypothesized to af-
fect engagement in risky sexual behaviors, such as unprotected sex, at 90 days
postintervention.
b Results: Using propensity score weighting, we found the intervention resulted in a sig-
nificant decrease in risky relationship thoughts (j0.529, p = .03) and risky relationship
thoughts resulted in an increase in unprotected sex (0.447, p G .001). However, the
direct effect of the intervention on unprotected sex was not significant (0.388, p = .479).
b Discussion: By reducing bias, propensity score models improve the accuracy of sta-
tistical analysis of interventions with mediators and allow researchers to determine not
only whether their intervention works but also how it works.
b Key Words: causal inference & incarcerated women & potential outcomes framework
Mediators, also known as medi-
ating variables, play a signifi-
cant role in most models of behavioral
intervention. In many programs, changes
in mediators are targeted to promote
change on the outcome of interest. Me-
diation occurs as part of a hypothesized
causal chain of events: The independent
variable (e.g., intervention) has an effect
on the mediator (e.g., risky relation-
ship thoughts), which then affects the
outcome (e.g., sex without condom).
Identification of mediators can reveal
important pathways that lead to behav-
ioral change (MacKinnon, 2008).
An important step in making inter-
ventions more efficacious and cost-
effective is to identify the mechanisms
by which the intervention has an effect
on the outcome. That is, researchers
not only need to know that the inter-
vention works but also need to know
how it works. Therefore, establishing
the causal link between the mediator
and the outcome is critical. The com-
monly used Baron and Kenny (1986)
approach to mediation and its exten-
sions (MacKinnon, 2008; see also, e.g.,
Krause et al., 2010; Levy, Landerman, &
Davis, 2011, for introductions to these
extensions for nursing researchers) rely
on an assumption of no unmeasured
confounding, which holds if individu-
als are randomly assigned to both the

intervention and the mediator. However,
as noted in the statistics and methodology
literature (e.g., Robins & Greenland,
1992; Rosenbaum, 1984), establishing
this causal link can be difficult because
randomization of individuals to levels
of the mediator is usually impossible.
Therefore, confounders that influence
both the mediator and the outcome
may exist and bias the estimate of the
effect of the mediator on the outcome.
The potential outcomes framework
(Rubin, 1974) for causal inference has
been proposed for assessing mediation
(e.g., Coffman, 2011; Imai, Keele, &
Tingley, 2010; Jo, 2008; VanderWeele,
2009). This framework clearly defines
the causal effects to be estimated and
states the assumptions needed to do so.
The goal of the present article is to
introduce an approach to mediation
that falls under the potential outcomes
framework for causal inference. We will
discuss the scientific question(s) that
may be addressed and the assumptions
required for identification and estima-
tion of causal mediation effects. Much
has been written in the statistics and ep-
idemiology literature about the various
approaches to assessing mediation, but
there are very few published applica-
tions of these approaches and, to our
knowledge, no published applications
in the nursing research literature.
Motivating Example
After three decades, the persistence of
the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United
States requires sustained attention. Dis-
tinct subgroups are infected dispropor-
tionately with HIV, such as individuals
who enter the criminal justice system,
especially women, with three to four
times greater infection rates than the
general population (Maruschak, 2009).
The risk factors underlying the dis-
proportionate HIV rates among incar-
cerated women include exchange of sex
for drugs or money, having a high-risk
sexual partner, inconsistent condom use,
and use of drugs or other substances
(Cotton-Oldenburg, Jordan, Martin,
& Kupper, 1999); these often occur
at greater frequency than in the gen-
eral population. The underlying causes
for greater frequency of these risk fac-
tors is not clear, but it is important to
intervene with this population because
many incarcerated women return to the
same behaviors, relationships, and fi-
nancial context upon release (Adams
et al., 2011). To date, very few inter-
ventions have focused on this popula-
tion (Lichtenstein & Malow, 2010).
To fill in the gap in the literature,
the Reducing Risky Relationships-HIV
(RRR-HIV) intervention, as part of the
Criminal Justice Drug Abuse Treatment
Studies cooperative agreement (Fletcher
& Wexler, 2005), was developed, pi-
loted, and tested among incarcerated
women (Havens et al., 2009; Staton-
Tindall et al., 2007). The intervention
was designed to address the context
of a relationship and to change risky
relationship thoughts with the aim of de-
creasing risky sex after release (Staton-
Tindall et al., 2007). Risky relationship
thoughts mediate the effect of the inter-
vention on risky sexual behavior. That
is, the intervention was hypothesized
to change risky relationship thoughts,
which in turn were hypothesized to
change risky sexual behaviors. These
effects are denoted with "1
and "2
, re-
spectively, in Figure 1. Also illustrated
in Figure 1 is the direct effect, "3
; that is,
the effect of the intervention on risky
sexual behavior that is not due to risky
relationship thoughts.
Potential Outcomes Framework
for Causal Inference
In the potential outcomes framework
(Rubin, 1974), each individual has a
potential outcome for each possible
treatment condition. For simplicity,
consider a binary treatment indicator,
Ti
, wherein Ti
= 1 denotes the inter-
vention condition and Ti
= 0 denotes
the control condition for participant i,
i = 1,I,n. In this case, there are two
potential outcomes for each individ-
ual: the potential outcome if the indi-
vidual receives the intervention, denoted
Yi
(1), and the potential outcome if the
individual is in the control condition,
denoted Yi
(0). The individual causal ef-
fect is the difference between these two
potential outcomes. Because each partic-
ipant is observed in only one of these
conditions, only one potential outcome
is observed; the other potential outcome
is missing, and therefore, the individual
causal effect cannot be computed. How-
ever, strategies have been implemented
to estimate the causal effect averaged
over participants in the study, called the
average causal effect. The average causal
effect is defined as E[Yi
(1) j Yi
(0)]; that
is, the expected (or average) difference
between the two potential outcomes.
Introductions to the potential outcomes
framework outside the mediation con-
text are provided by Little and Rubin
(2000) and Schafer and Kang (2008).
A mediator is an outcome assessed
within the context of the intervention,
and therefore, there are also potential
values for the mediator under each in-
tervention condition for each individ-
ual: the potential value of the mediator
under the intervention condition, de-
noted Mi
(1), and the potential value of
the mediator under the control condi-
tion, denoted Mi
(0). The potential val-
ues for the outcome are then expanded
to include potential values of the me-
diator. Thus, Yi
(1,Mi
(1)) is the poten-
tial outcome if individual i receives the
intervention, and Yi
(0,Mi
(0)) is the po-
tential outcome if individual i is in the
control condition. As before, only one
of these two potential outcomes is ob-
served for each individual.
Throughout this article, Yi
denotes
the observed value of unprotected sex
(operationalized in this study as having
had at least one sexual encounter with-
out a condom in the previous 30 days),
Mi
denotes the observed value for risky
relationship thoughts, and Yi
(ti
,Mi
(ti
))

denotes potential outcomes, wherein ti
is one of the levels of the intervention.
Xi
denotes measured confounders. It
is assumed throughout that if an indi-
vidual receives the intervention, then
Yi
= Yi
(1) = Yi
(1,Mi
(1)) and Mi
= Mi
(1).
Likewise, if an individual is in the con-
trol condition, then Yi
= Yi
(0) =
Yi
(0,Mi
(0)) and Mi
= Mi
(0). This usually
is referred to as the consistency assump-
tion. Also implicit in this notation is that
there is no interference among individ-
uals, because the potential outcomes
are a function of only Ti
and not Tj
,
wherein i and j denote two different
individuals. In other words, an individ-
ual's outcome does not depend on an-
other individual's treatment assignment.
Throughout this article, this noninter-
ference is assumed.
Using the Potential Outcomes
Framework to Define Mediation Effects
Three different definitions of mediation
using the potential outcomes framework
have been introduced in the statistics lit-
erature: principal strata effects, natural
effects, and controlled effects. The focus
here is on controlled effects, first intro-
duced by Robins and Greenland (1992).
In the motivating example, the con-
trolled direct effect is the causal effect
of the RRR-HIV intervention on un-
protected sex when risky relationship
thoughts is set (i.e., held constant) to a
specific value, m, for the entire pop-
ulation. That is, E[Yi
(1,m) j Yi
(0,m)],
wherein Yi
(t,m) is the potential out-
come when Ti
= ti
and Mi
(ti
) = m. For
the controlled direct effect, the media-
tor is set to the same value for every
individual. Also for a binary interven-
tion, such as RRR-HIV, there are as
many controlled direct effects as there
are possible values of the mediator. If
the controlled direct effects are differ-
ent across levels of the mediator, it
implies that there is an interaction be-
tween the intervention and the media-
tor. If the controlled direct effects are
equal across levels of the mediator, it
implies that there is no interaction be-
tween the intervention and mediator.
Next, consider defining the effect
E[Yi
(1,m) j Yi
(1,m¶)] for two different
values of m and m¶. This is the effect
of, for example, a one-unit change in
risky relationship thoughts on unpro-
tected sex when Ti
= 1. Similarly, the
difference E[Yi
(0,m) j Yi
(0,m¶)] defines
the effect of a one-unit change in risky
relationship thoughts on unprotected sex
when Ti
= 0. These differences define
the effect of risky relationship thoughts
on unprotected sex at each level of the
intervention. The effect of the interven-
tion on risky relationship thoughts is
defined as E[Mi
(1) j Mi
(0)]. Finally, if
there is no interaction between the in-
tervention and mediator, such that there
is only one controlled direct effect, the
controlled direct effect may be subtracted
from the total effect to obtain the in-
direct effect. The total effect is defined
as the effect of the intervention on un-
protected sex, E[Yi
(1) j Yi
(0)].
Identification and Estimation
Assumptions Much less attention has
been given to estimating mediation via
controlled effects than via natural ef-
fects or principal strata effects. How-
ever, as discussed by VanderWeele
(2009), if there is no interaction be-
tween the intervention and the media-
tor, then the controlled direct effect is
the same for every level of the medi-
ator. In this case, the controlled direct
effect can be subtracted from the total
effect to obtain the indirect effect. This
approach requires four assumptions:
(a) that there are no unmeasured con-
founders of the intervention and un-
protected sex; (b) that there are no
unmeasured confounders of the inter-
vention and risky relationship thoughts;
(c) that there are no unmeasured con-
founders of risky relationship thoughts
and unprotected sex; and (d) that there
are no interactions between the inter-
vention and risky relationship thoughts.
If individuals are randomized to levels
of the intervention, as they are in the
RRR-HIV study, then Assumptions (a)
and (b) hold. However, this random-
ization does not imply that Assumption
(c) holds. Randomization guarantees
that the intervention groups are equiv-
alent on prerandomization variables,
but it does not preclude the possibility
of differences between the intervention
groups on postrandomization variables.
Furthermore, randomization to levels of
the intervention does not mean that in-
dividuals are randomized to levels of the
mediator. Without randomization to lev-
els of the mediator, there is no guarantee
that there are no confounders of the me-
diator and outcome.
Estimation Coffman and Zhong (2011)
proposed to define and estimate all of
the effects given above using marginal
structural models (MSMs) with an in-
verse propensity weighted (IPW) esti-
mator using identifying Assumptions
(a) through (c). MSMs are models for
the potential outcomes and have been
described previously, along with IPW
estimation, in the prevention literature
(e.g., Bray, Almirall, Zimmerman,
Lynam, & Murphy, 2006; Coffman,
Caldwell, & Smith, in press) and epi-
demiology literature (e.g., Cole et al.,
2003; Robins, Hernan, & Brumback,
2000). For example, for continuous out-
comes, the MSMs may be given as

where "3

on risky relationship thoughts, and
"
2
¼ E½Yðt; mÞ À Yðt; m¶Þ is the effect
of risky relationship thoughts on un-
protected sex, holding constant inter-
vention condition. The MSMs are fit
by choosing an appropriate model for
the observed outcome (e.g., linear regres-
sion, logistic regression, and survival
model) and using the IPW estimator
rather than the usual ordinary least
squares or maximum likelihood esti-
mator. If individuals are randomized
to levels of the intervention, then As-
sumption (a) holds, and weights are
unnecessary for estimating Equation
(1). The models for the observed data,
as opposed to the potential outcomes,
are given as

Coffman and Zhong (2011) also
proposed a null hypothesis test of no
mediation. Specifically, the null hypoth-
esis is that either the effect of the inter-
vention on risky relationship thoughts or
the effect of risky relationship thoughts
on unprotected sex, holding constant in-
tervention condition, is zero. If Assump-
tion (d) holds, then an estimate of the

indirect effect may be obtained as de-
scribed above by subtracting the con-
trolled direct effect from the total effect.
However, it is not necessary to make
Assumption (d). Although an estimate
of the indirect effect itself requires As-
sumption (d), the null hypothesis test
of no mediation is still valid, and un-
biased estimates can be obtained of
the causal effect of the intervention on
risky relationship thoughts and of risky
relationship thoughts on unprotected
sex, holding constant intervention con-
dition regardless of whether Assump-
tion (d) holds.
Empirical Demonstration
Study Design and Participants The
data for these analyses came from the
RRR-HIV intervention. Briefly, the in-
tervention includes five group sessions
in prison (prior to release) and one in-
dividual telephone or face-to-face ses-
sion after release. The purpose of the
intervention is to change risky rela-
tionship thoughts, such as ``Having sex
without a condom will strengthen my
relationship,'' with the intent of re-
ducing HIV-risk behaviors. Participants
were recruited from correctional facili-
ties in Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky,
and Rhode Island. Women were eligi-
ble to participate if they were at least
18 years of age, scheduled to go before
the parole board in the next 6 weeks,
had at least weekly substance use be-
fore incarceration, and were willing to
be randomized to study condition. Inter-
vention details, including consent pro-
cedures, are described in Havens et al.
(2009) and Staton-Tindall et al. (2007).
Data were collected at three time
points: baseline, 30 days postinterven-
tion, and 90 days postintervention. The
participants include 243 women who
were present at each of the three time
points. The characteristics of this sam-
ple can be found in Table 1.
Measures All study measures were
based on participant self-report data
collected by trained research staff. Each
of the measures reports on behavior in
the previous 30 days. The outcome for
these analyses, measured at 90 days
postintervention, is unprotected sex, a
binary variable defined as 1 = having
had sex at least once without a condom
in the previous 30 days and 0 = no sex
without a condom or no sex in the
previous 30 days. The mediator, risky
relationship thoughts, is a scale score
computed by taking the mean of six
items. The scale of each item ranged
from 1 (never) to 10 (everyday); higher
scores correspond to more frequent
risky relationship thoughts. Coefficient
alpha for the items was .68 (95% con-
fidence interval [CI]: 0.61, 0.74; Maydeu-
Olivares, Coffman, & Hartmann, 2007).
The items were based on focus groups
by the study investigators prior to im-
plementation of the intervention (Staton-
Tindall et al., 2007).
Eighteen characteristics were in-
cluded in the propensity score model
to control for the potential confounding
between the mediator and the outcome.
Baseline sociodemographic character-
istics were included, such as race (Black
vs. not), housing (own home vs. other),
live with spouse or partner (yes or no),
marital status (married, previously mar-
ried, or single), high school graduate
(yes or no), employment status (full-time,
part-time, or unemployed), financial
support from job (number of months),
and have medical insurance (yes or no).
They also included numerous baseline
items, such as arrested (yes or no); spent
time in jail (yes or no); been abused phys-
ically, sexually, or emotionally in the
previous 6 months (yes or no); drank
alcohol (yes or no); alcohol use prob-
lems (mean of eight-item scale, 0 = never
to 4 = always); received drug treatment
since locked up (yes or no); drug use
problems (mean of eight-item scale, 0 =
never to 4 = always); substance use
problems (mean of three-item scale, 1 =
not at all to 4 = extremely); substance
use treatment important after release
(yes or no); and sex without a condom
at baseline intake (yes or no).
Statistical Analysis Assumptions (a)
through (c) were made, and MSMs and
an IPW estimator were used. The IPW
relies on propensity scores, defined as
the probability that an individual re-
ceives a particular level of the intervention
or exposure variable given measured con-
founders (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983).
Estimating propensity scores and cre-
ating weights for continuous variables,
such as risky relationship thoughts, is
only slightly more difficult than it is for
a binary variable. The propensity score
may be obtained from the probabil-
ity density function (p.d.f.) of risky rela-
tionship thoughts given the measured
confounders and treatment history,
@(Mi
|Xi
,Ti
) (Robins et al., 2000). The
propensity scores are obtained by a lin-
ear regression of Mi
on Xi
and Ti
, and

Essentially, this approach treats
the interventionYmediator sequence as
a time-varying treatment. Therefore, the
probability for the numerator of the
weights for risky relationship thoughts
is given by the p.d.f. of M given treat-
ment history, @(Mi
|Ti
). The probabil-
ity for the denominator of the weights
for the mediator is given by the p.d.f. of
M given treatment history and the mea-
sured confounders, @(Mi

); the
weights for risky relationship thoughts
are @(Mi

)/ @(Mi

). For further
details about creating weights and the
numerator and denominator models for
the weights, see Cole and Hernan (2008)
and Robins et al. (2000). After the weights
are created, they are incorporated into
Equation (4) in the same manner as survey
weights using SAS PROC GENMOD.
SAS PROC GLM was used for fitting
Equation (3), because no weights were
needed because the intervention was ran-
domized (see Document, Supplemental
Digital Content 1, for an example of SAS
code, http://links.lww.com/NRES/A69).
Results
Figure 2 illustrates what is commonly
referred to as balance on the measured
confounders and presents the correla-
tions between risky relationship thoughts
and the confounders included in the pro-
pensity model before and after weight-
ing. It is recommended that these
differences be less than .1 (in absolute
value), which is considered a small ef-
fect size (Cohen, 1988). Before weight-
ing, several of the correlations were
greater than |.1|, but after weighting,
they were all less than |.1|. If they were
not all less than |.1|, the propensity
model should be revisited and inter-
action or quadratic terms added to
the propensity model until balance is
achieved.
To determine whether the effect of
the intervention was mediated by risky
relationship thoughts, each of the effects
was estimated as described above. The
effect of the intervention on risky rela-
tionship thoughts was significant ("1
=
j0.529, p = .03, 95% CI: j1.00,
j0.06), such that the intervention re-
sulted in a decrease in risky relationship
thoughts. The effect of risky relation-
ship thoughts on unprotected sex was
also statistically significant ("2
= 0.447,
p G .001, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.68). A one-
unit increase in risky relationship thoughts
resulted in a 1.56 times increase in the
odds of unprotected sex. The effect of
the intervention on unprotected sex,
holding risky relationship thoughts con-
stant, was not significant ("3
= 0.388,
p = .479, 95% CI: j0.69, 1.46). Also
included was a term for the interaction
between the intervention and risky re-
lationship thoughts; however, it was
not statistically significant (j0.112,
p = .495, 95% CI: j0.43, 0.21). The
total effect of the RRR-HIV interven-
tion on unprotected sex (i.e., risky re-
lationship thoughts were not in the
model) was not significant (j0.092,
p = .731, 95% CI: j0.61, 0.43). The
requirement of a significant total effect
is controversial because there can be a
mediated effect even if the total ef-
fect is not significant. For example, this
may happen if there is another medi-
ator and the effect through that medi-
ator cancels out the effect through the
original mediator. It may happen also
if there are moderators, and there is
a positive mediated effect in one sub-
group and a negative mediated effect in
another subgroup. It is now generally
accepted in the statistical mediation lit-
erature that a significant total effect is
not required (MacKinnon, 2008).
Following the procedures in Coffman
and Zhong (2011), we rejected the null
hypothesis that either the effect of the in-
tervention on risky relationship thoughts
or the effect of risky relationship thoughts
on unprotected sex, holding constant in-
tervention condition, was zero (p = .028).
Based on this information, we concluded
that the intervention's effect on unpro-
tected sex was indeed mediated by risky
relationship thoughts.
Discussion
Mediation is, by definition, a question
about causal pathways. Even if indi-
viduals are randomly assigned to levels
of the intervention and randomization
does not fail (e.g., no noncompliance),
this does not imply that individuals are
randomly assigned to levels of the me-
diator. In fact, confounders of the medi-
ator and outcome almost always exist.
Without proper control of these con-
founders, the estimate of the effect of
the mediator on the outcome and the
estimate of the direct effect of the inter-
vention on the outcome will be biased.
Using IPW is one approach in con-
trolling for confounders. Another ap-
proach would be to control for all
confounders using regression adjust-
ment (i.e., ANCOVA); however, propen-
sity scores are advantageous because
they reduce a potentially large number
of confounders into a single-number
summary. Furthermore, regression ad-
justment may still result in biased esti-
mates of the direct effect if posttreatment
confounders are included in the regres-
sion model (Robins et al., 2000).
The RRR-HIV intervention was used
as a motivating example because of the
FIGURE 2. Correlations between risky relationship thoughts and each confounder before
and after weighting. Each line represents one of the potential confounders included in the
propensity model.

public health significance of HIV/AIDS,
especially among incarcerated women.
However, the public use data set posed
challenges because access to all the
potential mediators and confounders
of this study were unavailable. In partic-
ular, there was no measure of the me-
diator at baseline. The baseline measure
of the mediator is an obvious potential
confounder of the mediator at 30-day
follow-up and of the outcome at 90-day
follow-up. The method described above
relies on the assumption that all con-
founders are measured and controlled
properly. This is a very strong assump-
tion that cannot be tested in practice.
However, the more potential confound-
ers included in the propensity model,
the more plausible the assumption be-
comes. Thus, it is imperative that re-
searchers measure as many potential
confounders as possible. In addition,
the impact of the unmeasured con-
founder is mitigated if a measured po-
tential confounder is highly correlated
with the unmeasured confounder.
Nevertheless, a next step with ap-
proaches that rely on the assumption
of no unmeasured confounding is to
conduct a sensitivity analysis, which at-
tempts to determine how strongly influ-
ential an unmeasured confounder would
need to be to change the estimate in a
meaningful way (e.g., change the esti-
mate from statistically significant to
not, reverse the sign of the estimate).
Sensitivity analysis is being developed
for continuous exposures/mediators. De-
spite challenges of the data set, it was
possible to demonstrate how this ap-
proach can be used to assess mediation.
It should be noted that the traditional
regression approach to mediation,
which is likely familiar to most readers,
also assumes no unmeasured confound-
ing of the mediator and outcome,
although this assumption is rarely sta-
ted explicitly. Furthermore, in the tradi-
tional approach, researchers usually
control for only a few demographic var-
iables, if they control for any potential
confounders at all. As shown by Steiner,
Cook, Shadish, and Clark (2010), con-
trolling for only a few demographic var-
iables is generally insufficient to obtain
unbiased estimates.
For comparison, the model was
fit without the weights; that is, a lo-
gistic regression of unprotected sex on
the intervention and risky relationship
thoughts. As with the IPW estimates,
the effect of the intervention on un-
protected sex, holding constant risky
relationship thoughts, was not statis-
tically significant. The effect of risky
relationship thoughts on unprotected
sex, holding constant the intervention
condition, was statistically significant
(0.352, p G .001, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.50).
Thus, a one-unit increase in risky
relationship thoughts resulted in a
1.42 times increase in the odds of un-
protected sex. This estimate is not
dramatically different from the IPW
estimate (the CIs overlap); however, it
is a 14% difference in the odds ratio
point estimates.
The controlled effects approach is
valuable in nursing research. Controlled
effects differ from the traditional regres-
sion approach to mediation, primarily
in that weights are used in estimation, ac-
counting for potential confounding. The
controlled effects approach addresses
questions such as ``What is the effect of
the RRR-HIV intervention on unpro-
tected sex, holding constant the level of
risky relationship thoughts?'', ``What is
the effect of the RRR-HIV intervention
on risky relationship thoughts?'', and
``What is the effect of risky relationship
thoughts on unprotected sex, holding
constant intervention status?'' If As-
sumption (d) holds, then this approach
also addresses the question: ``What is
the effect of the RRR-HIV intervention
on unprotected sex that is due to risky
relationship thoughts?'' The indirect
effect itself is not identified unless there
is no interaction between the interven-
tion and mediator. Nevertheless, the two
effects that make up the indirect effect
(i.e., the effect of the intervention on the
mediator and the effect of the mediator
on the outcome, holding constant the in-
tervention condition) are identified re-
gardless of whether or not there is an
interaction between the intervention
and mediator. In summary, an advan-
tage of the potential outcomes frame-
work is that it allows for the careful
definition of causal effects and of the
assumptions needed for identification
and estimation of the causal effects. q
