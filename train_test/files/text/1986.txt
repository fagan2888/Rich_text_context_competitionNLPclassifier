Abstract
Objective: To characterize the trends, distribution, potential determinants and
public health implications of meat consumption within the USA.
Design: We examined temporal trends in meat consumption using food avail-
ability data from the FAO and US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and further
evaluated the meat intake by type (red, white, processed) in the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) linked to the MyPyramid Equivalents
Database (MPED).
Results: Overall meat consumption has continued to rise in the USA and the rest of
the developed world. Despite a shift towards higher poultry consumption, red meat
still represents the largest proportion of meat consumed in the USA (58 %). Twenty-
two per cent of the meat consumed in the USA is processed. According to the
NHANES 2003­2004, total meat intake averaged 128 g/d. The type and quantities of
meat reported varied by education, race, age and gender.
Conclusions: Given the plausible epidemiological evidence for red and processed
meat intake in cancer and chronic disease risk, understanding the trends and deter-
minants of meat consumption in the USA, where meat is consumed at more than three
times the global average, should be particularly pertinent to researchers and other
public health professionals aiming to reduce the global burden of chronic disease.

Chronic disease
Meat intake varies widely throughout the world. In the
USA and other developed countries, meat comprises a sig-
nificant portion of the normal diet, contributing more than
15% to daily energy intake, 40% to daily protein intake
and 20% to daily fat intake(1­3). The demand for meat
in developing countries continues to grow as the produc-
tion and consumption of meat increases with available
income(4,5). A shift towards a dietary pattern characterized
by high meat consumption also appears to supplant the
consumption of cereals and other foods of plant origin(1,6,7).
Early ecological comparisons provided the first indication
that high meat consumption correlated with higher rates of
chronic disease(8,9), including CVD and cancer, the current
leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the USA and
other Westernised countries(10). Health risks associated with
meat consumption vary based on the animal the meat is
derived from, as well as rearing, processing and preparation
methods(11). Meat can be further classified by the quantity
of red v. white muscle fibres; thus, beef, pork and lamb
products are generally defined as red meat and poultry
products as white meat. Preparation methods such as
smoking, curing, salting and/or addition of preservatives
further differentiate processed and fresh meat(11). The
components of meat linked to chronic disease risk include
fat content, particularly saturated fat in red meat, and
dietary cholesterol(12,13). Meat can also be a source of
several known mutagens, including N-nitroso compounds
(NOC) in processed meats, and heterocyclic amines
(HCA) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) formed
during high-temperature cooking and grilling(14).
Intake of fat and meat (primarily from red meat) has
been of public health concern since the late 1950s when
the American Heart Association first recommended that
dietary cholesterol, saturated fat and total fat be reduced
for the prevention of CVD(13,15); and to date, numerous
epidemiological studies have investigated meat intake
and cancer risk(16­19). According to the World Cancer
Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research
report in 2007, the evidence linking red and processed
meats to colorectal cancer was deemed `convincing' and
`limited or suggestive' for other cancer sites(20).
Based on the evidence to date, current dietary recom-
mendations for the prevention of diet-related chronic
diseases(20­23) suggest to limit intake of red and processed

meat and to eat mostly foods of plant origin. The present
study describes the trends, distribution and potential
determinants of meat consumption within the USA and
other parts of the developed world over the past several
decades. Further discussion addresses recent epidemio-
logical evidence for meat intake and chronic disease risk,
and impending public health concerns.
Methods
We used publicly accessible per capita food availability
data provided by the FAO(24) and the US Department of
Agriculture (USDA)(25) to compare temporal trends in
meat consumption in the USA and other developed
countries (defined by the FAO as Japan in Asia, Canada
and the USA in North America, Australia and New Zealand
in Oceania, and all of Europe). FAO and USDA databases
provide historical and chronological population-based
production and disappearance data (referred to as food
availability or consumption). We compared temporal
trends in the US meat disappearance data to dietary intake
data collected at the individual level from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)(26).
FAO
FAOSTAT(24) is the world's largest online agricultural
database (available at http://faostat.fao.org/) with data
from 190 FAO member countries. FAO compiles supply
and disappearance data submitted by member countries
in response to standard questionnaires, supplemented
with reviews of national sources and staff estimates or
imputations to cover critical gaps(5). The FAO classifies
total meat (excluding fish) as the sum of beef, poultry,
pork, sheep, goat and other game. Per capita meat con-
sumption (g/d), defined as the total amount of the com-
modity available for human consumption (i.e. after exports,
and other waste from farm to household), was available
from 1961 through 2005. Data from 1990 were revisited,
resulting in changes in the historical data. The methodology
for the estimation of food balance sheets was also revised
in FAOSTAT, including new aggregation techniques for
the conversion of transformed commodities (processed
and semi-processed) into primary equivalents (i.e. fresh
meat, excluding offal and fat)(24).
US Department of Agriculture
To look at US meat consumption and trends in more
detail, we referenced food availability data (also known
as US Food Supply Data or Disappearance Data) from the
USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) and accessible at
http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/Foodconsumption(25). The
ERS food data system reflects food availability per capita
on an annual basis from 1909 through 2007 at the national
level and serves as a popular proxy for actual consump-
tion. These data represent the boneless, trimmed (edible)
weight of fresh meat. Loss-adjusted data (removal of
non-edible food parts and food lost through spoilage,
plate waste and other losses in the home and marketing
system) were only available beginning from 1970. Red
meat commodities included beef, veal, pork, lamb and
mutton. Poultry commodities included turkey and
chicken. Fish and shellfish included fresh and frozen,
canned and cured products. Figures were calculated on
the basis of raw and edible meats, which exclude edible
offal, bones and viscera for red meat and fishery products,
but included skin, neck and giblets for poultry(25). The
USDA per capita data, provided in lb/year, were con-
verted to g/d (453?6 g/lb; 365?2 d/year) for the sake of
comparison with other data sources.
National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys
We examined data from NHANES for 1999­2000 (8074
people), 2001­2002 (9033 people) and 2003­2004 (8273
people). NHANES is a cross-sectional national survey
conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics of
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The
dietary portion was designed to provide nationally
representative estimates of food intake in adults and
children (civilian, non-institutionalized population), and
to track changes in health and nutritional status over time.
A single 24 h dietary recall from all respondents aged
2 years and older with reliable dietary data was included
and appropriate weighting factors were applied to adjust
for differential probabilities of selection and non-response.
Additional information on the survey designs, data collec-
tion protocols, weighting procedures and response rates
is given elsewhere(26).
To estimate meat intake we merged the NHANES data
with the appropriate MyPyramid Equivalents Database
(MPED). A new version of the MPED is developed for
each NHANES data release; thus, MPED 1?0(27) was
applied to survey data before 2002 and MPED 2?0(28), the
most current version available, to 2003­2004. MPED for
USDA Survey Foods translates the amounts of foods
eaten in USDA's What We Eat in America survey, the
dietary intake component of NHANES, into the number of
equivalents for the thirty-two MyPyramid major food
groups and subgroups(28). Meat intake reported in the
24 h dietary recall is converted to the equivalent number
of cup or ounce equivalents (servings) after disaggregat-
ing mixtures and discretionary fats. Allowable fat in the
meat group includes that present in lean cuts of meat
trimmed of all fat and poultry without skin. Cooked lean
meat ounce equivalents (servings) were defined as no
more than 9?28 g fat per 100 g of meat, poultry or fish,
or 3?53 ounces of cooked lean meat per 100 g of product,
with the remainder classified as discretionary fat(28). MPED
estimates were converted to g/d (28 g/oz). We used the
following food group variables from the database: meat,
poultry, fish with high n-3 fatty acid content, fish with low

n-3 fatty acid content and processed meat. The poultry
group consisted mainly of chicken and turkey. Total fish
was the sum of fish both high and low in n-3 fatty acids
plus shellfish. To generate a total red meat variable, we
included red meat (beef, pork, veal, lamb, game), as well as
the appropriate components of processed meat and organ
meats, based on the recipe files for each of the food items
in these food categories. Similarly, a total white meat vari-
able was generated from poultry and processed or organ
components from each of these groups. Total meat was the
sum of fresh (not processed) red and white meat, plus
cured meat, such as bacon and ham, as well as organ meats
and fish. Soya products were excluded. Processed meat,
by MPED definition(28), included frankfurters, sausage and
luncheon meats (made from meat or poultry), but did not
include cured meats, such as ham or bacon.
We used SUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute (RTI)
International, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) to gen-
erate weighted means (sampling weights provided by
NHANES)(26) and standard errors for each meat item (red
meat, poultry, fish and processed meat; g/d). We addi-
tionally examined meat intake stratified by gender, age
group, ethnicity and education level. Using a Bonferroni
correction to adjust for multiple comparisons, a two-sided
P , 0?0005 was considered statistically significant for any
single pair-wise comparison.
Results
Temporal trends in meat consumption in
developed countries
According to the international FAO data, total meat con-
sumption (excluding fish) in the USA, European Union (EU)
and the developed world as a whole has increased relatively
steadily over the period from 1961 to 2003 (Fig. 1). As early
as 1961, total meat consumption in the USA was nearly
double that of the EU and the developed world as a whole.
From 1961 to 2003, total meat consumption continued
to increase in all regions: nearly doubling in the EU and
increasing approximately 1?5-fold in the USA. Overall, meat
consumption appears to be on the rise in the developed
world as whole, but remains considerably lower than in
the USA.
Looking in more detail at meat consumption in the
USA, USDA data indicate that total meat consumption has
increased notably over the past century, nearly doubling
between 1909 and 2007 (Fig. 2). The lowest meat con-
sumption occurred in the 1930s and the highest meat
consumption was reached during the most recent decade.
Further examination attributes much of the increase to
a rise in poultry consumption beginning in the 1950s
through recent decades to make up a high proportion
of the total meat consumed in the USA. Red meat
consumption appears to have decreased over the past
few decades beginning in the 1980s, but still remains
the highest contributor to the total meat consumed. In
contrast, fish consumption has remained low and stable
over the past century.
The same data adjusted for loss, but only available from
1970, are comparable to the trends shown in Fig. 2 with
a marked increase in poultry consumption, a slight
decrease in red meat consumption and an overall trend
for increasing meat consumption. For the period 1970­
2007, per capita red meat consumption dropped from 105
to 85 g/d, while per capita poultry consumption more
than doubled from 25 to 55 g/d (loss-adjusted data not
shown). Per capita total loss-adjusted meat consumption

remaining close to this value (data not shown).
Components and determinants of meat
consumption in the USA
The NHANES (2003­2004) data from a single 24 h dietary
recall indicate that approximately 58 % of the meat con-
sumed in the USA was red meat, 32 % poultry and 10 %
fish (Fig. 3). Processed meat intake constituted 22 % of the
total meat consumed from either red meat or poultry
categories. Women consumed a slightly higher propor-
tion of poultry than men (34 % and 30 %, respectively), a
lower proportion of red meat (55 % and 60 %, respec-
tively) and nearly equal proportions of processed meat
(data not shown).
Table 1 describes US meat intake from NHANES
(2003­2004) by gender, age, ethnicity and education
level. In this nationally representative sample, total meat
intake averaged 128 g/d (sum of red meat, poultry and
fish). Compared with women, men consumed more of
every type of meat per day (all pair-wise comparisons
(not shown) were statistically significant (P , 0?0005)).
With the exception of fish, peak meat consumption
occurred in adults aged 20­49 years, particularly for red
meat (80?3 g/d), with lower intake at younger and older
ages (P , 0?0005 for ages 20­49 years compared to
$70 years for red meat, poultry, total meat and processed
meat). Whites, Blacks and Hispanics all reported similar
intake of red meat. Blacks consumed the highest amount
of poultry (54?4 g/d) compared to Whites (P , 0?0005)
and Hispanics (P,0?001, NS for multiple comparisons).
Hispanics reported lower processed meat intake than
Whites (P,0?001 (NS)) and Blacks (P,0?0005). Poultry
and fish consumption appeared to increase with education

level. Results between 1999­2000 and 2001­2002 were not
notably different from the 2003­2004 results presented
here. Across the 1999­2000, 2001­2002 and 2003­2004
surveys, red meat intake appeared to decrease slightly,
while poultry intake appeared to increase slightly (data
not shown), which is in agreement with the data from the
USDA (Fig. 2).
Discussion
Food availability data indicate that overall meat consumption
is on the rise in the developed nations of the world and that
the USA remains the highest consumer of total meat. Despite
a shift towards increased poultry consumption, red meat
still represents the largest proportion of meat consumed
in the USA and nearly a quarter of the meat consumed is
processed. Meat selection and consumption behaviours
appeared to vary by education, race, age and gender.
Despite the near record-high per capita consumption of
total meat in recent years, the proportion of fat, particularly
saturated fat, in the US food supply from meat, poultry and
fish has slowly declined(3). Public health and consumer
concerns regarding fat and cholesterol in the late 1980s
led to greater demand for lean meat and poultry, increased
trimming of visible fat on meat at the retail level and con-
sumer substitution of poultry for red meat(3,29). Reports on
fat consumption trends in the USA have shown a marked
reduction in the proportion of fat from foods identified as
major sources of saturated fat, including red meat (pork and
beef) over the past several decades(30,31).
Previous reports have shown that the consumer's
knowledge and awareness of diet and health may affect
the proportion of red v. white meat consumed both at
home and away from home(32). Chronological USDA data
suggest that although poultry consumption has increased,
red meat consumption has decreased comparably little,
leaving total meat consumption on the rise. Both loss-
adjusted USDA data and intake values in NHANES suggest
that current total meat intake for adults in the USA ranges
from 100 to 150 g/d with more than half (50­90 g/d)
coming from red meat. The affordability of meat in the
USA, combined with rising consumer incomes, may
explain this trend. While vertical integration in US poultry
production resulted in a large, low-cost supply of poultry,
the USA remains the world's largest beef producer and
exporter, as well as a leading beef importer(3,33). During
1994­1996, beef was a close second to yeast bread as the
leading source of energy in US adults; and the primary
source of both protein and total fat(34). Meat consump-
tion, production and trade flows are also subject to
temporary fluctuations due to food safety issues. The
outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy or `mad
cow disease' identified in the UK in the 1980s and later
in the USA (2003) was a considerable blow to the beef
industry and trade(35,36).
The NHANES data suggest that recent patterns of meat
intake and overall consumption differ within the US
population according to various demographic factors,
reflecting perhaps cultural, social, regional and financial
influences on diet. NHANES may provide a different picture
of meat intake in US individuals than have large, US pro-
spective cohorts, whose participants are largely Caucasian,
age 50 years or above, and college educated. Although at a
national level the demand for meat would be expected
to increase with economic growth, individual intake has

tended to level off, and may even decline, at the highest
levels of socio-economic status(37). Lower meat intake,
particularly red and processed meat, with increasing adult
age and education may reflect heightened awareness
of health and/or adoption of dietary practices for the
prevention or management of chronic disease.
Possible health implications of meat consumption
Meat in the diet provides an important source of protein
and micronutrients, such as iron, zinc and vitamin B(38).
However, energy-dense diets, purported to be high in
meat, fats and sugars, and further compounded by seden-
tary lifestyle, have been implicated in the growing epi-
demics of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases(20,39).
Evidence suggests that vegetarians may be at lower risk
for CVD, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity and some
cancers(40­44). However, low-fat/high-carbohydrate diets
have not been wholly positive or successful in reducing the
burden of chronic disease within the general popula-
tion(45­47); and lean meat and fish continue to be part of the
recommendations for a balanced, healthy diet(13,48).
Inflammation and oxidative stress have also been
linked to the intake of meat and disease risk. Red meat,
possibly due to its fat and iron content, may increase
inflammation and oxidative stress, but less is known
regarding lean and white meats(41,49). Conversely, the
intake of fish has been shown to decrease markers of
inflammation and oxidative stress(50,51). Meat cooking
(high temperature, charring) and processing techniques,
such as smoking, curing, salting or the addition of che-
mical preservatives, lead to the formation of carcinogenic
compounds, such as NOC, HCA and PAH(17,52,53). Exposure
to NOC occurs from both endogenous formation, which is
directly related to red meat intake(54), as well as exogenous
exposure from nitrite-preserved meats(55). Nitrate, which
can be reduced to nitrite and contribute to NOC forma-
tion, is also present in non-meat sources, such as vege-
tables and fruits(56); however, red meat is a key source of
readily available haem iron, which may further increase
endogenous NOC formation(57). HCA and PAH, which are
formed during high-temperature cooking of meat(58),
dose-dependently generate DNA adducts(59).
The most robust human evidence is for red and pro-
cessed meat intake and colorectal cancer(19,20,60­64). To
date, there appears to be little or no association for meat
intake and breast cancer(65­69), while findings for other
major cancers such as prostate, lung, kidney and pancreatic
cancer are less conclusive(70­73). In a comprehensive
investigation from a US prospective study of over 500 000
men and women, a significant increased risk of incident
cancers of the colorectum, oesophagus, lung and liver was
associated with red meat and increased risk of colorectal
and lung cancer was associated with higher intake of pro-
cessed meat(17); red and processed meat intake was also
associated with all-cause, CVD and cancer mortality, while
higher intake of white meat was associated with lower risk
of death(74). The relationship between meat intake and
cancer risk is not wholly consistent and the complex
mechanisms involved continue to warrant further investi-
gation. Current epidemiological research suggests that
moderate meat intake may not increase risk(75) and that
endogenous and exogenous mutagens formed during meat
cooking and processing may be important(53,61,69,73,76,77).
Strengths and limitations
Results presented herein should be viewed with caution
and the limitations of food supply/disappearance and
cross-sectional data clearly acknowledged. There are a
number of disadvantages to using food availability data,
even though it is important for international comparisons
as well as for looking at the overall, historic trends. Meat
consumption data presented here are primarily based on
annual food availability per capita at the national level
and serve as popular proxies for actual consumption. The
FAO derives their values from data submitted by member
countries and are therefore limited by the completeness
and accuracy of reporting at the national level.
It is important to recognise that while each data source
appears to tell a similar story of US meat consumption
trends, USDA food availability and NHANES individual
intake data serve different objectives(30). The US food
availability and consumption data measure the flow of raw
and semi-processed agricultural commodities throughout
the US marketing system at an aggregate level(78). For both
FAO and USDA food consumption data, human food intake
is not directly measured and losses from trimming, cooking,
waste and spoilage are not fully estimable despite use of
conversion factors that attempt to adjust for probable los-
ses; this appeared to result in as much as a 100g difference
between current adjusted (150 g/d) and unadjusted USDA
values (250 g/d). Individual-level intake data, such as those
collected in NHANES from individual sample respondents,
measure only edible and reportedly consumed foods from
a designated period or point in time. In a large sample,
such as NHANES, a single 24h dietary recall should provide
a valid estimate of total meat intake at a population level
and should also be adequate to capture relative con-
sumption of different types of meat(79,80). The NHANES
population itself presents a number of advantages for
studying current US meat intake. The NHANES sampling
aims to capture the diversity, as well as regional variation in
the US population. Younger age groups and minority popu-
lations sampled in NHANES are often under-represented
in most large epidemiological and US prospective studies.
In addition, most prospective cohorts in the USA and
Europe began in the mid 1980s to 1990s, serving as the
baseline level of intake, which USDA and NHANES data
suggest may be considerably lower than the current US
intake. Thus, comparably modest associations with meat in
cohort populations may or may not translate to the broader
US population, which national estimates suggest may be at
differential, if not greater, risk in the near future.

Although historical food availability data may not be a
precise representation of intake, the measurement meth-
odology has remained relatively consistent over time.
Thus, comparing FAO and USDA data with NHANES data
is a useful way to corroborate changing meat consump-
tion patterns and trends(31). For the period 2003­2004, we
found similar meat intake patterns for the relative pro-
portion of types of meat consumed from both USDA and
NHANES data. Unfortunately, the lag in the development
and linkage of the MPED, the USDA's food group data-
base, limits our ability to present NHANES meat intake
data beyond 2003­2004. NHANES was the only data
source in our analysis that shed light on processed meat
intake and although it appears to make up a high pro-
portion of the total meat currently consumed, we are
unable to track long-term changes in its availability and
consumption. USDA and FAO tracking methods, by nature,
do not allow for historical trend data on meat that has
undergone processing, which may be derived from both
fresh red meat and poultry. Due to emerging epidemio-
logical evidence on the risks of various cancers associated
with high processed meat intake, recommendations to
reduce consumption of processed meat are relatively
new compared to those for red meat. In addition, there is
no generally agreed upon definition of processed meat,
making it difficult to define and target in both public
health research and practice.
Conclusion
Understanding the trends and determinants of meat
consumption in the USA, where meat is consumed at
more than three times the global average(5), should be
particularly pertinent to researchers and other public
health professionals aiming to reduce the global burden
of chronic disease. While saturated fat intake appears to
be declining(3,29­31), other components of red and pro-
cessed meat continue to pose a health risk, particularly
when consumed in large quantities(17,52­55,57­59). Dietary
recommendations for meat should perhaps begin to
increase awareness regarding potentially harmful cooking
and processing methods(14,53). Studying food consump-
tion and selection behaviours sheds light on the barriers
we continue to face with the food industry and con-
sumers, as well as international foresight into future
epidemics and their causes. As the main determinant of
per capita meat consumption across the world appears to
be wealth, examining trends in the USA and the rest of the
developed world may forecast the global public health
and environmental burdens we should expect to face in
the highly populated developing world(4). The growing
preference in the USA for poultry, but not fish, as a
replacement for red meat suggests the need for more
epidemiological investigations of white meat and its
relationship with long-term health and disease outcomes.
