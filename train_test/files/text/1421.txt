Age at menopause is associated with a variety of health outcomes. Menstrual histories, both as markers of
physiologic function and through their potential association with age at menopause, have also been investigated
for their links to health outcomes. This study used data from a cohort of women from the United States who
provided prospectively recorded data on their menstrual cycles for many years. Dr. Alan Treloar (University of
Minnesota) originally recruited the women in the 1930s; the authors used data reported by these women from
1930 through 1977. They identified nuanced characteristics of menstrual histories that were strongly predictive
of the onset of menopause, focusing on measures of central tendency (the mean), variability (standard deviation),
and serial irregularity (approximate entropy), the last of which quantifies a continuum that ranges from totally
ordered to completely random. They controlled for other characteristics known to affect age at menopause,
including use of exogenous hormones, number of births, and extent of breastfeeding. Although cycle length and
variability increased with the approach of menopause, the authors found that serial irregularity decreased and
was a strong predictor of its onset. This finding constitutes an important piece of information not attainable with
conventional statistical summaries of menstrual histories.

Over the past two decades, an expanding body of literature
has documented links between a woman's age at menopause
and her health. Menstrual cycle patterns, as markers of phys-
iologic function and through their potential association with
age at menopause, have also been investigated for their links
to health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to identify
more highly nuanced features of menstrual histories than
have been examined previously and to demonstrate their
relation to age at menopause. These linkages are an impor-
tant step toward a deeper understanding of the precursors of
a broad range of health outcomes.
Early menopause has been tied to a number of negative
outcomes, including a higher risk of cardiovascular disease
(1, 2), osteoporosis (2, 3), and higher all-cause mortality (4­
6). Late age at menopause has been found to be associated
with a higher risk of breast (2, 7) and endometrial (2, 8)
cancers. Menstrual cycle characteristics, most notably length
of the intermenstrual interval, have also been identified as
risk factors for a variety of health conditions including poly-
cystic ovary syndrome (9), coronary heart disease (10), and
risk of fracture (11). Some investigators (12­14) have also
found a link between diabetes and cycle characteristics,
although recent work (15) found no association between
adult-onset diabetes and mean cycle length, number of long
cycles, or cycle variability.
Along with parity (4, 16), use of oral contraceptives (16),
and age at menarche (17), menstrual cycle characteristics
also appear to be associated with age at menopause. While
results across studies appear to show consistent links with
respect to cycle length, findings about cycle variability are

mixed. Late age at menopause is associated with longer
mean cycle length (18, 19); similarly, short cycle lengths are
associated with early onset of menopause (2, 16). However,
den Tonkelaar et al. (18) and Whelan et al. (2) found no
significant relation between cycle length variability and age
at menopause.
We examined the link between bleeding patterns
throughout a woman's reproductive lifetime and her age at
menopause; characteristics of the full menstrual history were
considered. We identified characteristics of bleeding
patterns that may provide prospective criteria for identifying
the menopausal transition. Prior studies of cycle characteris-
tics have focused on first- and second-order descriptive
statistics (measures of central tendency and spread). As
described below, we used a measure of approximate entropy
(ApEn) to add an important dimension to earlier work.
Whereas a measure of spread such as the standard deviation
or range captures the variability of cycles, ApEn is a
measure that enabled us to quantify their serial irregularity.
Because common parlance with regard to menstrual cycles
uses "regularity" to refer to statistical variability (women
typically report having regular or irregular cycles, meaning
that cycle lengths are not very variable or highly variable,
respectively), we paid particular attention to characterizing
the distinction between these two concepts. We also empha-
sized the new information captured by ApEn and described
how it augments standard descriptive statistics in identifying
features of menstrual histories linked to age at menopause.
We performed two sets of complementary analyses. First,
we examined survival models following women from age 40
years forward (although we included information on events
that occurred before, as well as after, age 40 years) and
examined how cycle characteristics influence the age-related
hazard of menopause. Second, we looked backward from
menopause and explored diagnostic characteristics of peri-
menopausal menstrual patterns. Thus, we explored both
prospective and retrospective links between cycle character-
istics and menopause.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Dr. Alan Treloar (University of Minnesota) initiated the
Menstruation and Reproductive History Study in 1934.
Subsequently renamed "The Tremin Trust" and deeded to
the University of Utah, it was directed by Dr. Ann Voda until
1998, when the study moved to The Pennsylvania State
University under the direction of Dr. Phyllis Mansfield. The
original goal was "to define quantitatively the rhythm pattern
of the human menstrual cycle through current recording of
dates of onset and cessation of flow" (20, p. 78). Over time,
in addition to prospectively recorded data on onset and dura-
tion of successive bleeds, women contributed data relating to
their use of exogenous hormones, marital and reproductive
histories, surgical interventions, and a wide range of other
information. A second cohort of women was recruited
during the 1960s, but our study used data from a subset of
women drawn from the original recruits (born between 1908
and 1922) who were still enrolled in the study at age 40
years. The institutional review board at Georgetown Univer-
sity (Washington, DC) approved this project.
We first used proportional hazards models to examine the
relation between age at menopause and a set of covariates.
Women entered exposure to the risk of menopause at age 40
years and exited because they were censored (either tempo-
rarily or permanently) or reached menopause. We assumed
that exposure began at age 40 years because none of the
women we observed experienced menopause before that
age. Our sample was limited to 444 women who contributed
data before age 40 years. Reasons for exclusion prior to age
40 years included death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal from
the study, sterilization, and use of exogenous hormones
throughout their history or without a defined endpoint.
Because we used cycle characteristics prior to age 40 years
as predictors of onset of menopause, we also excluded three
women all of whose observed cycles prior to age 40 years
were affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding. Data for the
444 women were incorporated into our models until the
women reached menopause or were (permanently) censored
owing to death, loss to follow-up, or sterilization. Data on
surgical sterilization were not complete for some women:
type of procedure was not always reported. In some cases,
we knew only that a subject was "sterilized" and the date of
the procedure. It is possible that fallopian tubes were inter-
rupted without interfering with the uterus or ovaries or that
only one ovary was removed (25 women reported unilateral
oophorectomies). However, we had too few cases (20
unspecified "sterilizations") to estimate such an effect in our
models. Therefore, we censored all women (those who
reported a hysterectomy, unilateral or bilateral oophorec-
tomy, or unspecified sterilization) at the time of surgery.
Table 1 shows the number of women, by category,
excluded from the analysis. More than half were excluded
because of only partial information on use of exogenous
hormones. In principle, women recorded start and stop dates

for all sustained treatments (including oral contraceptives);
however, many stop dates were missing, so we used a
conservative approach in our analysis, excluding spells for
which we were uncertain of hormonal status.
Observations could also be (temporarily) censored for a
variety of reasons: hormonal treatments, pregnancy, breast-
feeding, and breaks in reporting. For hormonal treatments,
we censored data beginning with onset of treatment and
extending 4 months following the end of treatment to allow
for hormonal washout. Similarly, women contributed data 4
months after they reported the end of pregnancy or breast-
feeding.
We calculated the overall hazard of menopause by using
Kaplan-Meier estimates; we used Cox survival models to
adjust for covariates (21). We calculated robust standard
errors of the hazard ratios that adjusted for clustering attrib-
utable to multiple observations per subject. Although our
primary interest lay in the relation between age at meno-
pause and cycle patterns, we controlled for other factors
known or hypothesized to be associated with age at meno-
pause: age at menarche, number of pregnancies, breast-
feeding, and use of exogenous hormones. We examined the
effect of cycle patterns after age 40 years, net of these other
factors, by using nested models.
Our hazard models followed each subject until she reached
menopause or was permanently censored. Women were
censored as discussed above or if menopause was not
confirmed or was confounded by hormonal treatment. Our
models included a set of variables that described each
woman's experience. These variables included fixed charac-
teristics and several that change over time. Their distribu-
tions in our population are summarized in table 2.
Dependent variable: age at menopause
This variable was defined as age at the start of the last
reported menstrual cycle prior to confirmed menopause
(defined as at least a year without report of a menstrual bleed
or menopause confirmed by the participant or the director of
The Tremin Trust).
Menstrual cycle characteristics before age 40 years
Mean and standard deviation. For each woman, we
calculated the mean and standard deviation of menstrual
cycle lengths in four 5-year age groups. Models that used the
median and interquartile range (data not shown) revealed no
substantive differences in the results. We used only those
cycles in which women were not pregnant, breastfeeding,
within 4 months postpartum, or using exogenous hormones.
For some subjects, data were insufficient to calculate
menstrual characteristics in one or more of the age catego-
ries. This deficiency can occur because a subject had long
breaks in the information reported, but this cause was rare in
our data. More commonly, women experienced cycles that
were excluded owing to their use of exogenous hormones,
pregnancy, or breastfeeding. Our models included a dummy
variable to allow for missing data, and we assigned the mean
for all women at that age as their value for the variable.
ApEn. To quantify irregularity, we used ApEn, a model-
independent statistic defined by Pincus (22), with further
mathematical properties and representative biologic appli-
cations given by Pincus (23), Pincus and Goldberger (24),
Pincus and Huang (25), Pincus and Singer (26), and Pincus
et al. (27, 28). ApEn was introduced to quantify regularity in
sequences and time-series data, initially motivated by appli-
cations to relatively short, noisy data (24, 26). This statistic
has been used extensively to characterize the degree of
randomness in a variety of applications that explore regu-
larity in physiologic systems, including patterns of hormonal
secretion and heart rate dynamics (27­31). ApEn assigns a
nonnegative number to a time-series; larger values corre-
spond to greater apparent process randomness or serial irreg-
ularity, and smaller values correspond to more instances of
recognizable features of patterns in the data. The opposing
extremes are perfectly regular sequences (very small ApEn)
and independent sequential processes (very large ApEn).
Two input parameters--a run length m and a tolerance
window r--must be specified to compute ApEn, formally
denoted ApEn(m,r). Briefly, ApEn measures the logarithmic
likelihood that runs of patterns close (within r) for m contig-
uous observations remain close (within the same tolerance
width r) on incremental comparisons (22). ApEn(m,r) must
be considered a family of parameters; comparisons are
intended with fixed m and r.
For this study, we calculated ApEn(m,r) values for all data
with well-established parameter values of m = 1 and r = 20
percent of the standard deviation of the overall subject time
series, applied to running blocks of 50 data points. Because r
thus specified had a value of less than 1.0 and because cycle
lengths were reported in integer or full-day values rather
than as a continuous measurement, the choice of r for the
present analysis "reduced" to an application of ApEn with
m = 1 and r = 0 (exact pairwise matches in the data). For
these m and r parameter values, and for series of 50 data
points as studied here, ApEn ranged from a minimal value of
0 for perfectly regular series to a maximum of 1.493 for
completely disordered series. Thus, a 10 percent change in
ApEn corresponded to an ApEn increment of approximately
0.15 here. Multiple previous studies, including both theoret-
ical analyses and applications (22­30), have demonstrated
that the choice of m = 1 and r = 20 percent of the standard
deviation as parameters (as above) produces good statistical
reproducibility (one ApEn standard deviation  0.06 under
very general conditions) for ApEn for time series of the
kinds of lengths we analyzed.
In discrete-state space with r = 0, asymptotically, ApEn
equals the information theoretical rate of entropy (23), inter-
preted as the average information content per source output
symbol. In other model-based settings, ApEn can be evalu-
ated analytically by either multiple integral (continuous-
state) or sum (discrete-state) expressions (22). Further tech-
nical discussion of the mathematical and statistical proper-
ties of ApEn, including robustness to noise and artifacts,
relative consistency of (m,r) pair choices, asymptotic
normality under general assumptions, statistical bias, and
error estimation for general processes, can be found in
Pincus (23), Pincus and Goldberger (24), and Pincus and
Huang (25). To develop a more intuitive, physiologic under-

standing of the ApEn definition, a multistep description of its
typical algorithmic implementation, with figures, was devel-
oped in Pincus and Goldberger.
Because "regularity" in the context of menstrual cycles is
commonly used to describe cycles with low variation, we
clarified how the two concepts differ. Figure 1 shows two
rows of (hypothetical) data. In the top row are patterns of
cycles, alternating high and low values, characterized by
low serial irregularity (indeed, both are perfectly regular;
ApEn = 0 for each). The graph on the left shows data that
are highly variable--characterized by a high standard devi-
ation--while the graph on the right shows data that have
low variability (a low standard deviation). In the bottom
row are patterns of cycles characterized by high serial irreg-
ularity (high ApEn) and high and low variability (left and
right, respectively). The ApEn value for the left panel of this
row is 1.31; for the right panel, it is 1.34. Thus, both of these
series are at least 85 percent maximally irregular. Yet,
despite the lack of obvious repetitive features in each of
these bottom panels, each has an ApEn value more than
0.15 smaller than the maximal value, that is, at least 2.5
ApEn standard deviations below maximal irregularity.

Figure 2 shows two "typical" histories that appeared in our
data. The graphs display the length in days (y-axis) of
successive intermenstrual intervals (the intervals between
successive onsets of menses) by age (x-axis) for two
different women. Statistics for these two women (mean,
standard deviation, and ApEn) are shown in figure 3.
Woman 1's history reflects fairly level variability in cycle
length throughout most of her reproductive life; the vari-
ability of woman 2's cycles was greater. Variability (and
mean cycle length) for both women increased as they
approached the menopausal transition. For woman 1, ApEn
values were high and level until the menopausal transition
and then declined sharply. Until the menopausal transition,
changes in her cycle lengths appeared to be highly random
(high ApEn); during the menopausal transition, her cycles
were highly variable but exhibited less randomness
(declining ApEn). The cycles of woman 2 were character-
ized by greater variation in mean, standard deviation, and
ApEn statistics throughout most of her reproductive history,
but, as observed for woman 1, regularity increased (ApEn
declines) during the menopausal transition.
Menstrual cycle characteristics at age 40 years or older:
mean, standard deviation, and ApEn
We included menstrual cycle information as time-varying
covariates, estimated for 3-year intervals, from age 40 years
forward. A dummy variable was introduced into the model to
enable us to assess whether the hazard for women for whom
data were missing for any interval was statistically signifi-
cantly different from the hazard for those who reported data.
Intervals for which data were missing were assigned the
mean value at that age.
Other covariates
Age at menarche. When first recruited, subjects reported
how old they were at the time of their first menses. Because
most were college students at the University of Minnesota,
recall of age at menarche was probably fairly accurate, but
the majority reported their age only in completed years. This
deficiency is likely to underestimate the true relation
between menarche and menopause if it exists. As shown in
table 2, mean age at menarche for these women was 12.4
years.
Number of births. This covariate was defined as total
number of live- and stillbirths prior to age 40 years.
Months of breastfeeding. We defined this covariate as
total months of breastfeeding for all births. As shown in table
2, breastfeeding was not widely practiced. Less than a
quarter of the women breastfed at all; for those who did,
average cumulative time, over all births, was less than 10
months.
Use of exogenous hormones prior to age 40 years. Although
data on cycles occurring during exogenous hormone use were
excluded, these substances may affect the timing of menopause
later in life. Therefore, a dichotomous variable indicating
whether the subject used exogenous hormones prior to age 40

tolerance window; N, length of the series.
Menopause and Patterns of Menstrual Bleeding 787
Am J Epidemiol 2003;158:782­791
years was included in the model. (We also tested variables
representing hormone use within each 5-year age segment.
None of these variables was significant, and we therefore
simplified the model by using one dichotomous variable.)
Use of exogenous hormones after age 40 years. We in-
corporated a time-varying covariate (3-year intervals) that
indicated whether the woman reported use of hormones after
age 40 years.
Break in history after age 40 years. We used a time-
varying covariate to indicate whether the woman's cycle
history included intervals during which she did not report
information.
Birth after age 40 years. We included a dichotomous
variable to indicate whether the subject reported a birth after
age 40 years (37 women did so).
Although the Cox survival models allowed us to examine
the data prospectively, we also examined the data retrospec-
tively to explore aggregate characteristics prior to meno-
pause in the subset of women for whom menopause was
observed. For these analyses, we aligned cycle information
as of the date of menopause (time 0) and followed cycle
patterns back over the years preceding menopause. We
examined the mean, standard deviation, and serial irregu-
larity (ApEn).
RESULTS
The overall hazard of menopause (without covariates)
when Kaplan-Meier estimates were used is shown in figure
4. Consistent with earlier work on these data (2), median age
at menopause was 50.5 years; 75 percent of women reached
menopause by age 52.4 years and 95 percent by age 54.7
years.
Results of the hazard modeling are shown in table 3.
Model 1 included the cycle patterns and other covariates
prior to age 40 years for each woman. Age at menarche and
number of births were inversely related to the hazard; corre-
spondingly, later age at menarche and a greater number of
births were associated with later age at menopause. We
found no statistically discernible relation between age at
menopause and use of hormones prior to age 40 years or
number of months of breastfeeding. Cycle characteristics
prior to age 40 years were not, in general, significantly
related to age at menopause, although there was a marginally
significant (p = 0.059) relation between high variability in
cycle length at ages 35­39 years and earlier onset of meno-
pause.
Model 2 introduced time-varying covariates for the mean,
standard deviation, and ApEn of cycle length after age 40
years. Relative to model 2, the improvement in fit of the
model attributable to adding the cycle characteristics after

788 Weinstein et al.
Am J Epidemiol 2003;158:782­791
age 40 years was statistically significant (p < 0.001). After
age 40 years, cycle characteristics were related to onset of
menopause: higher standard deviation was significantly
associated (p = 0.05) with increased hazard (i.e., earlier
onset). ApEn was significantly and strongly, but inversely,
associated (p < 0.001) with the hazard. When the mean and
standard deviation were held constant, we found that the
higher the ApEn (the greater the irregularity), the lower the
hazard. Lower ApEn after age 40 years--greater regu-
larity--was strongly predictive of the onset of menopause.
Overall, as cycles became longer, more variable, and yet
more regular (with lower ApEn), the hazard of menopause
increased. A break in history after age 40 years was associ-
ated with a significantly lower hazard of menopause; in our
data, there was no discernible relation between a birth after
age 40 years and the hazard.
Insight into these results was most easily gained from the
"retrospective" analysis, shown in figure 5. Cycle character-
istics were aligned as of the onset of menopause, with time
running "backward" from 0 (age at menopause). The
familiar aggregate pattern of increases in both mean and
standard deviation during the menopausal transition can be
seen (20). ApEn was equally striking: in the aggregate,
ApEn rose slightly (irregularity increased) until about 8
years prior to menopause, when it declined dramatically. In
other words, regularity increased sharply in the years
preceding menopause.

 A central assumption of Cox proportional hazards models is that the effect of a given variable is the same
within any time segment. The Schoenfeld test (39) was used for proportionality of hazards to examine this
assumption. The test resulted in a global 2 statistic of 13.88 (p = 0.79); no single 2 statistic exceeded a value of
6.54. The Schoenfeld test is highly sensitive; the results supported use of the Cox proportional hazards model.
 Dummy variables were used to test for the effects of missing data on cycle characteristics (mean, standard
deviation, approximate entropy) in each 5-year age group. These indicators were not significant and were
dropped from the model. The respondent's year of birth was also tested and was dropped from the model
because it was not significant. Also tested was whether a more detailed characterization of hormone use prior to
age 40 years (using 5-year age groups) would improve model fit. These variables were not significant, so two
dichotomous variables (hormone use prior to age 40 years, hormone use after age 40 years) were used in the
final models.
§ Dummy variables were used to test for the effects of missing data on cycle characteristics after age 40
years (mean, standard deviation, approximate entropy). These indicators were not significant and were dropped
from the model. Also tested was whether the length of a break in history after age 40 years was related to the
hazard. It was not included in the final model because it was not significant.

DISCUSSION
Whelan et al. (2), who used these same data to explore
factors associated with age at menopause, found that short
cycle length between ages 20 and 35 years was associated
with earlier onset of menopause, even while controlling for
variability, but that the effect of high variability, which was
associated with later onset, did not persist in the presence of
controls for cycle length. Our study, in contrast, focused on
the joint effects of cycle characteristics while simultaneously
adjusting for age at menarche, months of breastfeeding, and
use of exogenous hormones. Considered jointly, no statisti-
cally discernible effect of cycle characteristics (mean length,
variability, and irregularity) between ages 15 and 39 years
was found on age at menopause. This result is in sharp
contrast to our finding that after age 40 years, both higher
variability and greater regularity were significant predictors
of the onset of menopause. Our findings with respect to age
at menarche and number of births are consistent with those
of other researchers (4).
We speculate that the underlying causal mechanism relating
both breastfeeding and pregnancy to age at menopause lies in
the relation between follicular atresia and estrogen. Estrogen
has been found to be important in inhibiting follicular atresia
(32­35), and it plays a significant role in stimulating follicle
growth and maturation: Atretic follicles show a decreased
estrogen-to-androgen ratio, evidence for the apoptosis-inhib-
iting and -inducing effect of the respective hormones (36).
Changes in steroid levels most likely play a role in initiation of
apoptosis. When estrogen is withdrawn completely, apoptotic
DNA fragmentation in the granulose cells of the ovary
increases. Estrogens inhibit apoptosis in the ovary, while
androgens and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists
promote apoptosis (37). Atretic follicles show decreased
estrogen production, an important factor in follicle survival
(38). During pregnancy, estrogen levels are high, an environ-
ment that inhibits follicular atresia. During lactation, when
estrogen levels remain low, apoptotic cell loss is promoted.
Thus, pregnancy delays onset of menopause, while lactation is
associated with earlier onset.
Because we expected that secular changes in nutrition,
particularly in use of fats, might affect age at menopause, we
tested for, but did not find, an effect associated with birth
year. However, all women in the study were born within a
fairly short time. Data currently being collected and entered
from women who have been participating in The Tremin
Trust study since the 1960s will enable us to examine
whether there has been such a change over time. We also
found that women who had a break in their reports after age
40 years (although they subsequently resumed data
recording) were likely to have a later age at menopause
compared with women who provided uninterrupted data.
This result may be an artifact: the later the age at menopause,
the longer the exposure to the risk of interruption.
A parallel can be drawn between the findings of this study
and changes in patterns of hormonal secretion as women
approach menopause. Matt et al. (31) compared healthy late
premenopausal women (aged 39­49 years) with younger
women (aged 26­29 years) whose menstrual cycles and
body weights were normal; ApEn scores for patterns of
luteinizing hormone release for late premenopausal women
were lower (more regular) than for younger women (corrob-
orated by analyses from "pulse identification" algorithms).
The decrease in ApEn was followed by a pronounced
increase in ApEn scores for older postmenopausal women
(30). These researchers hypothesized that the decrease and
nonmonotonicity in ApEn luteinizing hormone evolution
that precede menopause may reflect system instability prior
to dramatic state change. Our findings suggest that the
decline in ApEn characterizing cycle lengths may be an indi-
rect marker of corresponding underlying hormonal changes.
This study shows that, while cycle length and variability
increase with the approach of menopause, regularity also
increases and is a strong predictor of its onset--an important

piece of information not attainable with conventional statis-
tical summaries of menstrual histories. We are currently
completing a study of the women recruited for the second
cohort, for whom we have histories of cycle characteristics
and daily morning urine specimens that are being assayed for
the urinary conjugates of both estradiol and progesterone,
which will enable us to examine the extent to which these
characteristics reflect hormonal changes.
