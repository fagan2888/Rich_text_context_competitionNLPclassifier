OBJECTIVE -- Exposure to acrylamide in foodstuffs and smoking has become a worldwide
concern. The effect of acrylamide on glucose homeostasis is not known. The goal of the present
study was to test the hypothesis that trace acrylamide exposure might be independently associ-
ated with both reduced blood insulin and reduced insulin resistance.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We examined 1,356 participants with reli-
able measures of glucose homeostasis and Hb adducts of acrylamide (HbAA) and glycidamide
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2003­2004. Glucose homeostasis
was assessed by the measurement of plasma glucose, serum insulin, and the homeostasis model
assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).
RESULTS -- In a linear regression model, a 1-unit increase in log HbAA was associated with
a decrease in serum insulin ( coefficient  0.20  0.05, P  0.001) and HOMA-IR (
coefficient  0.23  0.05, P  0.001). After HbAA concentrations were divided into quartiles
in the fully adjusted models, the adjusted serum insulin level and HOMA-IR significantly de-
creased across quartiles of HbAA (Ptrend
 0.001 for both). In subgroup analysis, the association
of HbAA levels with HOMA-IR and insulin levels was stronger in subjects who were white or had
ever smoked or in subjects with a lower education level or a BMI 25 or 30 kg/m2.
CONCLUSIONS -- Acrylamide is associated with reduced serum insulin levels in adults.
Further clinical and animal studies are warranted to clarify the putative causal relationship.

Acrylamide, a highly reactive ,-
unsaturated carbonyl compound, is
widely used to synthesize polymers
for industrial applications such as soil
conditioning, wastewater treatment, re-
search applications, cosmetics, and the
paper and textile industries (1). Besides
industrial and laboratory uses, acryl-
amide in foodstuffs has become a world-
wide concern because of its generation in
a variety of fried and oven-baked foods
during cooking. Attention was drawn to
this fact initially by Tareke et al. (2) in
2002, and subsequent biochemical anal-
ysis showed that heating of free amino ac-
ids (asparagines) and sugars during food
processing at 248°F (120°C) resulted in
the formation of acrylamide concentra-
tions of up to 1 mg/kg food (3). According
to recent data, the mean daily workplace
inhalation exposure is 1.4­18.6 g/kg
body wt (4), whereas human consumption
via food is about 1 g  kg body wt1 
day1 in the general population and 4 g 
kg body wt1  day1 in high consumers
(5). Moreover, acrylamide is a component
of cigarette smoke. Its content has been es-
timated at 1.1­2.34 g/cigarette, which is
clearly an important source of acrylamide
exposure (6).
The majority of acrylamide is conju-
gated with glutathione in the human
body, and some (about 15%) is activated
by cytochrome P450 CYP2E1 to a reactive
epoxy compound, glycidamide. Glycid-
amide is subsequently metabolized by hy-
drolysis and conjugated with glutathione.
Acrylamide and glycidamide form ad-
ducts with the NH2
-terminal NH2
group
of the valine residue of Hb (7). Hb ad-
ducts reflect an integrated concentration
over 4 months (8); therefore, these adducts
are useful as predictors of toxicity. Hb ad-
ducts of acrylamide (HbAA) and glycidam-
ide (HbGA) have been used as biomarkers
of exposure and to estimate the internal
dose from workplace exposure as well as in
the general population (9).
The biological consequences of acryl-
amide exposure have chiefly centered on
neurotoxicity ever since this effect was
observed in humans exposed to this com-
pound in the workplace (9). Subse-
quently, experimental exposure of
rodents to acrylamide has shown im-
paired development, reproductive toxic-
ity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity.
However, epidemiological studies in the
workplace and general population have
not established an unambiguous link be-
tween acrylamide exposure and human
cancer (9­11). Acrylamide was classified
by the International Agency for Research
on Cancer as a probable human carcino-
gen (12). Given the lack of dose-response
data for human neurotoxicity, the risk as-
sessment was based on rodent studies and
supported by primate studies of acryl-
amide neuropathy. Based on these data,
the World Health Organization in 2005
concluded that the "no observed effect
level" for acrylamide neuropathy is 0.2
mg  kg body wt1  day1 (5). This pro-
vides a margin between exposure and the
no observed effect level of 200. Therefore,
it is not likely that acrylamide-induced
neurotoxicity will be detected in the gen-
eral population.
A recent study, using an animal
model, showed both lower insulin and
triglyceride concentrations after continu-
ous intake of trace acrylamide in a dose of
0.28 ppm similar to that for the general
population (13). In another study, rats

treated with acrylamide at relatively low
doses demonstrated diminished appeti-
tive motivation (14). In a recent cross-
sectional epidemiology study in Europe,
HbAA was inversely associated with BMI
in smokers (15). Based on these studies,
we hypothesized that trace acrylamide ex-
posure might be independently associ-
ated with reduced insulin resistance and
improved serum lipid profiles. Because
the homeostasis model assessment for in-
sulin resistance (HOMA-IR) is a reliable
surrogate measure of insulin resistance
(16), we can use fasting glucose and insu-
lin concentrations to accurately estimate
insulin resistance status. The goal of the
present study was to test this hypothesis
by examining data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) collected from 2003 to 2004.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- Data were from NHANES
2003­2004. The NHANES is a
population-based survey designed to
collect information on the health and nu-
trition of the U.S. household population
and to obtain a representative sample of
the noninstitutionalized civilian U.S.
population. The survey data are released
every 2 years. Detailed survey operations
manuals, consent documents, and bro-
chures of the NHANES 2003­2004 are
available on the NHANES Web site (17).
We limited our analyses to the 6,990 par-
ticipants aged at least 20 years who had a
test for HbAA and HbGA. Among these
subjects, only 3,169 had a morning exam-
ination and measurements of fasting
plasma glucose and serum insulin. Of
these participants, 1,356 subjects without
missing data were included in the final
analyses.
Anthropometric and biochemical
data
According to the statements on the
NHANES Web site, data were collected at
all study sites by trained personnel using
standardized procedures. Sociodemo-
graphic and medical information such as
age, sex, race/ethnicity, education level,
household income, and medication usage
were collected during the household in-
terview. Alcohol intake was recorded and
determined by the questionnaire and cat-
egorized into three levels (12 drinks,
144 drinks, and 144 drinks per year).
Smoking status was categorized as active
smoker, former smoker, and nonsmoker
by a questionnaire on smoking (18). We
also quantified smoking status by serum
cotinine levels (0.1, 0.1­10, or 10
ng/ml) in the same manner as in a previ-
ous study (19). BMI was calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared. Waist circumference was
measured at the iliac crest to the nearest
0.1 cm. Laboratory measurements were
performed in a mobile examination cen-
ter. For serum markers, blood specimens
were collected by glass tubes (red-top Va-
cutainer), whereas for plasma glucose,
blood specimens were collected in a vac-
uum tube containing sodium fluoride
(gray-top Vacutainer). Blood specimens
were processed locally and then were
stored and shipped to central laboratories
for analysis. Levels of serum total choles-
terol and triglyceride were measured en-
zymatically. Levels of HDL cholesterol
were measured after precipitation of other
lipoproteins on a Hitachi model 704 ana-
lyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
IN). Plasma glucose was measured by the
hexokinase enzymatic method (Cobas
Mira Chemistry System; Roche Diagnos-
tic Systems, Montclair, NJ). Serum C-
reactive protein levels were measured by
latex-enhanced nephelometry (Dade Be-
hring Nephelometer II Analyzer System;
Dade Behring Diagnostic, Somerville,
NJ). Cotinine was measured in serum
samples using isotope-dilution high-
performance liquid chromatography/
atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
tandem mass spectrometry (Hewlett-
Packard model 1090L high-performance
liquid chromatograph and PE-Sciex API
III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer)
(20). GHb was measured by a boronate
affinity high-performance liquid chroma-
tography system and converted to A1C
levels (automated high-performance liq-
uid chromatography system, model
CLC330; Primus, Kansas City, MO.). Se-
rum insulin was determined by immu-
noenzymatic assay with Tosoh AIA-PACK
immunoreactive insulin. The HOMA-IR,
the product of basal glucose and insulin
levels divided by 22.5, was used as a reli-
able surrogate measure of insulin resis-
tance (16).
Assessment of HbAA and HbGA
Human whole blood or erythrocytes were
used to measure HbAA and HbGA. Spe-
cifically, the reaction products with the
NH2
-terminal valine of the Hb protein
chains (N-[2-carbamoylethyl] valine and
N-[2-hydroxycarbamoyl-ethyl] valine for
acrylamide and glycidamide adducts, re-
spectively) were measured. This method
is based on a modified Edman reaction,
which uses the formation of Edman prod-
ucts from N-alkylated amino acids in neu-
tral or alkaline conditions rather than the
acidic conditions required in the conven-
tional Edman reaction (21). This opti-
mized method was further refined and
modified to increase the sensitivity and
enable automation. HbAA and HbGA
were quantified using octapeptides with
the same amino acid sequence as the
NH2
terminus of the -chain of Hb and
with acrylamide and glycidamide at-
tached at the valine residue (AA-
VHLTPEEK, GA-VHLTPEEK); the
corresponding stable isotope-labeled
AA-Val(13C5 15N)-HLTPEEK was used
as an internal standard. Total Hb was
measured using calibrators provided
with the manufacturer's assay kit (22).
The limit of detection was 2 pmol/g Hb
for HbAA and 3 pmol/g Hb for HbGA.
For concentrations below the detection
limits (only 0.07 and 2.2% of blood
samples, respectively), a value was as-
signed by NHANES that we used in our
analyses.
Statistics
Data are expressed as means  SE. Con-
tinuous variables were compared be-
tween groups by an unpaired Student t
test, whereas categorical variables were
compared by a 2 test. The strength of the
associations between the concentrations
of HbAA, HbGA, and plasma glucose ho-
meostatic markers was tested using linear
regression models.
For linear regression models, we
used an extended model approach for
covariates to adjust for potential con-
founders. Model 1 was adjusted for age,
sex, and race; model 2 was adjusted for
age, sex, race, smoking status, alcohol
intake, education levels, household in-
come, BMI, A1C, and insulin/glucose/
HOMA-IR. When the plasma glucose
was treated as an independent variable,
serum insulin was entered as a depen-
dent variable and vice versa. When the
independent variables were the deriva-
tives of the plasma glucose and the se-
rum insulin, both the plasma glucose
and the serum insulin were not adjusted
in the model. The HOMA-IR was ad-
justed in the final model if the indepen-
dent variable was not an arithmetic
combination of the plasma glucose and
the serum insulin. The relative contri-
bution of each dependent variable to
predict the variation of dependent vari-
able was determined by partial R2. Log
transformation was performed for vari-

ables with significant deviation from a
normal distribution before further
analyses.
We performed three sets of sensitiv-
ity analyses to test the robustness of our
findings. First, to explore whether the
associations between certain serum
markers and HbAA and HbGA might be
mediated by different foods (e.g.,
greater consumption of high-fat, high-
calorie foods might result in high HbAA
and HbGA and insulin resistance), we
examined the associations after includ-
ing daily nutrient intake (daily calories,
carbohydrate, total fat, cholesterol, and
fiber) from NHANES dietary interview
data (23). Second, because medications
such as antihyperglycemic, antihyper-
tensive, and antihyperlipidemic agents
might confound associations between
HbAA concentrations and other glucose
homeostatic markers, we performed our
analyses again, including data on self-
reported current medication usage.
Third, because smoking is a major
source of acrylamide exposure, we ad-
justed the smoking status both by ques-
tionnaire data and serum cotinine levels
to avoid possible recall bias.
Sampling weights that account for
unequal probabilities of selection, over-
sampling, and nonresponse were applied
for all analyses using the Complex Sample
Survey module of SPSS (version 13.0 for
Windows XP; SPSS, Chicago, IL).
RESULTS -- The study sample in-
cluded 1,356 participants (Table 1).
The weighted geometric mean HbAA
concentrations were adjusted for age,
sex, and race/ethnicity. As shown in Ta-
ble 1, the mean HbAA concentrations
were higher in young adults, men, ac-
tive smokers, and subjects with a lower
education level, lower annual house-
hold income, and lower BMI. Weighted
mean HbGA concentrations were
higher in young adults, active smokers,
and subjects with a lower education
level. The mean  SE values for plasma
glucose, serum insulin, and HOMA-IR
were 5.61  0.05 mmol/l, 64.7  2.9
pmol/l, and 2.89  0.13, respectively.

Acrylamide and glucose homeostasis
2208 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 32, NUMBER 12, DECEMBER 2009 care.diabetesjournals.org
HbAA levels and markers of glucose ho-
meostasis in sample subjects are shown in
Table 2. A 1-unit increase in log HbAA
was associated with a decrease in the se-
rum insulin ( coefficient  0.20 
0.05, P  0.001) and HOMA-IR ( coef-
ficient  0.23  0.05, P  0.001). R2
values in the regression models were
0.363 and 0.418, respectively. The five
most important determinants of serum
insulin (partial R2) were BMI (0.231),
acrylamide (0.013), smoking status
(0.010), age (0.007), and alcohol intake
(0.006). For HOMA-IR, the five most im-
portant determinants were BMI (0.198),
A1C (0.074), acrylamide (0.013), smok-
ing status (0.009), and age (0.008). HbAA
levels were not associated with plasma
glucose concentrations, A1C levels, lipid
metabolism, C-reactive protein levels,
and waist circumference. The results were
similar after subjects with diabetes were
excluded (data not shown). There were
no associations between HbGA levels and
any of the measured parameters (data not
shown).
Linear regression coefficients (SEM)
between HbAA, serum insulin, and
HOMA-IR levels in different subgroups of
subjects are shown in Table 3. The asso-
ciations between HbAA and HOMA-IR
were all significant in each age-group,
whereas the insulin levels were not signif-
icant in older age (60 years). Moreover,
the HbAA levels were associated with
HOMA-IR and insulin levels in each sex
but were more significant in subjects who
were white, ever smokers, or had a lower
education level or a BMI 25 or 30 kg/
m2. We divided the HbAA levels into
quartiles in the fully adjusted models, and
the adjusted serum insulin levels and
HOMA-IR are shown in Fig. 1. The trends
of the serum insulin levels and HOMA-IR
across quartiles of the HbAA levels were
significant (P  0.001 for both).
For sensitivity analyses, we first in-
cluded daily nutrient intake (log-
transformed daily calories, carbohydrate,
total fat, cholesterol, and fiber) in our
models. The inverse associations between
HbAA concentrations and serum insulin
( coefficient  0.25  0.05, P 
0.001) and HOMA-IR ( coefficient 
0.27  0.06, P  0.001) remained sig-
nificant in ever smokers. Second, after ad-
justment for medication usage
(antihyperlipidemic, antihyperglycemic,
and antihypertensive agents), the HbAA
concentrations remained significantly as-
sociated with serum insulin levels ( co-
efficient  0.24  0.05, P  0.001) and
HOMA-IR ( coefficient  0.26 
0.05, P  0.001). Finally, the results were
similar whether smoking status was ob-
tained by questionnaire or by serum coti-
nine levels (data not shown).
CONCLUSIONS -- Although there
are several studies on the relationship be-
tween acrylamide exposure and health
outcome, the relationship of acrylamide
levels to diseases and laboratory abnor-
malities in a representative sample from a
national population has never been ex-
plored. In the present study, we first
showed that increased HbAA was associ-

ated with a decrease in blood insulin and
insulin resistance status in adults.
There has been a great deal of
progress in the last few years in under-
standing the toxicology and distribution
of acrylamide in animals and in humans.
However, the effects of acrylamide on glu-
cose homeostasis and lipid metabolism
were addressed in only one animal study
(13). In that study, male Wistar rats were
fed with acrylamide, formed from frying
oil heated for 20 h at 180°C, for 12 weeks.
The amount of acrylamide ingested was
estimated to be similar to daily human
intake (0.28 ppm). All of the rats grew
well, and no gross abnormalities attribut-
able to the experimental oil were ob-
served, except that the acrylamide-fed
rats had significantly lower insulin and
triglyceride levels. These findings are in
accord with ours, but the causal biochem-
ical mechanisms are not clear. Because
chronic smoking is associated with insu-
lin resistance and high insulin levels (24),
it is interesting that acrylamide in ciga-
rette smoke might counterbalance the ef-
fect of smoking on glucose homeostasis.
From subgroup analyses in the present
study, increased acrylamide concentra-
tions were generally associated with de-
creased serum insulin levels, particularly
in subjects who were active smokers and
had a low education level and high BMI,
all of which are associated with high in-
sulin resistance. Perhaps the association
between acrylamide and insulin is more
obvious in subjects with high acrylamide
or high insulin resistance.
In a recent animal study, rats treated
with acrylamide at doses of 5.0 mg  kg1 
day1) showed measurable decrements
of food-motivated behavior when tested
at 6­12 weeks of age. The lack of a body
weight difference between treatment
groups in these animals during the course
of testing suggests that acrylamide may be
capable of producing a direct effect on
appetitive motivation in rats (14). How-
ever, the dosage used was far higher than
exposure of the general human popula-
tion. According to a recent cross-sectional
epidemiology study in Europe, HbAA is
inversely associated with BMI in smokers
without adjustment for potential con-
founders (15). In our study, we also
showed that HbAA is inversely associated
with BMI and waist circumference with
simple adjustment. However, after ad-
justment for smoking status, the associa-
tion was not significant. Because smoking
is an important source of acrylamide ex-
posure and smoking could lead to weight
loss, the association is probably con-
founded by smoking status.
Nutritional status, particularly amino
acid balance, has an important effect on
glutathione homeostasis (25), which may
be relevant in detoxification. The ade-
quate provision of sulfur-containing
amino acids as well as glutamate and gly-
cine is critical for the maximization of glu-
tathione synthesis. Although there was no
information about amino acid intake, the
daily caloric and protein intakes were es-
timated to be 2,307.0  44.1 kcal and
1.09  0.03 g/kg, respectively, which are
unlikely to lead to glutathione deficiency
and therefore have little or no effect on
acrylamide conjugation.
Measurements of HbAA and HbGA
are expensive and difficult but well estab-
lished. The modified Edman reaction
method used in NHANES was success-
fully applied to adducts produced by
acrylamide and glycidamide. This opti-
mized method has been refined and mod-
ified in-house to increase sensitivity and
enable automation. It has been widely
used in several studies (8,21) and makes
measurement of acrylamide exposure
possible in population studies.
Figure 1--Box and whisker plots of HOMA-IR (A) and adjusted serum insulin levels (B) across
quartiles of the HbAA adducts in the fully adjusted model (age, sex, race, smoking status, alcohol
intake, education level, household income, BMI, and plasma glucose or serum insulin). The trends
of plasma insulin levels and HOMA-IR across quartiles of HbAA adducts were significant (P 
0.001 for both).

Our study has several limitations.
First, the cross-sectional design does not
permit any causal inferences. Second, ex-
posure to acrylamide also might be an in-
dicator of exposure to multiple chemicals,
including other endocrine disruptors in
smokers. If the associations reported here
are confirmed in independent studies,
more work will be needed to identify the
mechanisms of action linking long-term,
low-dose acrylamide exposure to health
outcomes in humans.
In summary, we present the first re-
port that acrylamide exposure is associ-
ated with both reduced blood insulin and
insulin resistance. Because exposure to
acrylamide in foodstuffs and smoking has
become a worldwide concern, further
longitudinal clinical and in vitro studies
are urgently needed to elucidate the puta-
tive causal relationship.
