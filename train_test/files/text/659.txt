Distribution and Association of Chronic Disease and Mobility Difficulty
across Four Body Mass Index Categories of African-American Women
Daniel O. Clark1'2 and Simon M. Mungai2
A majority of African-American women over the age of 50 are obese, have at least one chronic disease, and
experience mobility difficulty. Using self-reported data from the 1992 Health and Retirement Study of 1,150
African-American women aged 30-70 years, this report first compares chronic disease prevalence and
severity, pain, sensory deficits, and mobility difficulty across four categories of body mass index and, second,
investigates whether body mass index affects the association of chronic disease with mobility difficulty. Body
mass index was categorized as low, medium, high, and severe, being equal to 19-24 (20%), 25-29 (38%),
30-34 (24%), and 35 or over (18%), respectively. There were few differences when comparing the medium
category with either the low or high category. Those in the severe body mass index category, however,
reported significantly more frequent and severe hypertension, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, arthritis, pain,
sensory deficits, and mobility difficulty than did those in the medium body mass index category. Obesity did
not appear to affect the association between chronic disease and mobility difficulty. The relatively high rates
of mobility difficulty observed among the severe body mass index group appear to be more likely a result of
relatively high chronic disease prevalence and severity than to a disproportionate impact of these on mobility.

Because of its high prevalence, obesity represents
a serious public health concern among African-
American women, particularly during the middle and
late adulthood years (1). It has been shown that two
thirds of late middle-aged (e.g., 51-61 years)
African-American women are obese and that over one
half report mobility difficulty (2). Relative to Cauca-
sian women and African-American men, African-
American women are over 1.5 times more likely to
have a body mass index of 30 or greater and to report
a mobility limitation or difficulty (1-6). Obesity ap-
pears to have important implications for mobility (2, 5,
7-9), and mobility, in turn, has important implications

for the performance of basic and household activities
of daily living (10).
The relation between obesity and mobility is likely
complex but may operate largely through chronic dis-
ease, the most important being arthritis. In fact, several
studies have shown that obesity elevates the risk and
severity (based on symptomatic and radiographic data)
of osteoarthritis of the knee (11-14) by increasing the
mechanical stress that is placed on the knee (15).
Obesity is also known to be associated with a range of
chronic diseases other than arthritis, including cardio-
vascular disease (particularly hypertension), diabetes
mellitus, and some cancers, but epidemiologic studies
to determine whether obesity exacerbates the lower
body impact of these diseases are generally not avail-
able.
The 1992 Health and Retirement Study provides an
opportunity to investigate whether obesity affects the
865

impact of chronic disease on mobility difficulty among
1,150 African-American women who range in age
from 30 to 70 years. We have limited our analyses to
African-American women because of their particularly
high rates of obesity and mobility difficulty. First, we
compare distributions on sociodemographic character-
istics, health behaviors, chronic disease prevalence
and severity, pain and sensory impairments, and mo-
bility difficulty across four categories delineated by
body mass indexes of 19-24, 25-29, 30-34, and 35 or
over. Second, we present the results of multiple re-
gression equations that estimate the association be-
tween chronic disease and mobility difficulty for each
of the body mass index categories while controlling
sociodemographic characteristics and health behav-
iors. Our specific hypothesis is that chronic disease in
general and arthritis in particular are stronger risk
factors (i.e., have greater associations) for mobility
difficulty among African-American women with body
mass indexes of 30-34 or 35 or over than among those
with body mass indexes of less than 30.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data
The Health and Retirement Study was funded by the
National Institute on Aging, conducted by the Institute
for Social Research at the University of Michigan, and
designed to provide in-depth data for the investigation
of analytical and policy issues surrounding retirement.
Thus, the primary age group selected (ages 51-61)
was intended to include a majority of persons who had
not yet retired but who would likely retire in the
coming decade. Approximately 70,000 households ob-
tained through an area probability sample were
screened to identify age-eligible respondents. Census
tracts containing a high density of African Americans
were oversampled by a 2:1 ratio. All households
within the high density census tracts that were identi-
fied as having an age-eligible respondent were se-
lected. All spouses were included in the study regard-
less of age because of the frequency of dual-earner
couples and the influence of spouses in the retirement
decision process. Thus, in addition to the 965 African-
American women aged 51-61 years who form a
representative sample of this age category, the Health
and Retirement Study includes data on 236 African-
American women outside this age range. The latter
women do not constitute a representative sample. By
the most conservative criteria, the overall response
rate was 82 percent, and comparisons with 1990 Cen-
sus data provide no indication of sample bias. Because
of the subjective nature of several of the measures
used in the equations that follow, we limit our analyses
to self-respondents. The proxy response rate among
African-American women was 2.6 percent, leaving
1,169 self-respondents.
Measures
A body mass index was created by dividing self-
reported weight in kilograms by self-reported height in
meters squared. We partially follow the weight tables
presented in the 1995 Dietary Guidelines (16) in de-
lineating weight categories. In that report, body mass
index was separated into three categories: 19-24, 25-
29, and 30 or over. Because of the large percentage of
respondents in the 30 or over category, we have split
that category into two (30-34 and 35 or over). We
have labeled these categories low, medium, high, and
very high body mass index. The Health and Retire-
ment Study contains 19 African-American women
with a body mass index of less than 19, and those
women were excluded from the analyses presented
here.
In the Health and Retirement Study, respondents
who considered themselves primarily black or African
American were coded accordingly. Sociodemographic
measures included age, number of children associated
with the.respondent, marital status, mother's and fa-
ther's educational status, respondent's educational sta-
tus, financial status (including income and net worth),
working status, and southern geographic residence.
Obesity has been shown to be associated with moth-
er's and father's educational attainment, an indicator
of childhood social and economic status (1, 17) and
perhaps genetic inheritance (17). Obesity is also asso-
ciated with parity, but we were unable to determine
exact parity through the Health and Retirement Study
data and have created a measure of the number of
children associated with the respondent. This variable
represents all children living with or without the re-
spondent. An indicator for southern residence is used
in an attempt to capture important geographic differ-
ences in experience and lifestyle that may exist within
the older African-American population (18). Distribu-
tions on all measures and their coding schemes are
shown in tables 1 and 2.
The previous year's combined income for husband
and spouse (if present) is obtained through summation
of the many different measures of income provided in
the Health and Retirement Study. Missing data on
wages and salary occurred on a relatively modest 12
percent of the sample, and the Institute for Social
Research assigned these missing cases predicted val-
ues based on a simple regression model including age,
race, and sex. Unfortunately, difficulties with missing
data on questions of net worth are a larger problem in
survey research. The use of bracketing techniques in
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 145, No. 10, 1997
Chronic Disease and Mobility across Body Mass Index Categories 867
the baseline Health and Retirement Study had a sizable
impact on item-nonresponse rates (reducing nonre-
sponse by 75 percent on most items), and the Health
and Retirement Study compares favorably with other
large social surveys in terms of missing asset data
(19). Still, 40 percent of Health and Retirement Study
households have missing asset values on at least one
item, and imputation was necessary. The imputation
for net worth followed the approach used for income.
For both income and net worth, we have used a di-
chotomy set at 10,000 dollars, which minimizes the
impact of imputation and provides a measure that
approximates yearly earnings of one full-time, mini-
mum wage job.
For health behaviors, respondents were asked
whether they have ever smoked cigarettes (defined as
100 or more over their life), whether they currently
smoke cigarettes, and how many they currently smoke
in 1 day. Pipe smoking and cigar smoking were not
included. Alcohol consumption was measured with
four questions that form the CAGE scale of alcohol
consumption (20). A score of Â£2 on the CAGE scale
is generally used to indicate alcoholism. Two ques-
tions regarding physical activity are available in the
Health and Retirement Study. One asks about the
frequency of light physical activity (e.g., dancing,
walking), and the second asks about the frequency of
heavy physical activity (e.g., running, swimming). In-
dicator variables were used to represent those who
reported participating in these activities at least once a
week.
It is important to note that self-reports of disease are
somewhat less reliable than medical records data, and
there is some evidence that blacks underreport chronic
disease (21). To minimize bias, the Health and Retire-
ment Study asked respondents whether they had ever
been told by a doctor that they have high blood pres-
sure or hypertension, diabetes or high blood sugar,
cancer other than skin cancer, or chronic lung disease
(excluding asthma) such as chronic bronchitis or em-
physema. The name of the organ or body site of the
most recent cancer was obtained. Respondents were
also asked in a single question whether they had ever
been told by a doctor that they had had a heart attack,
coronary heart disease, angina, or other heart prob-
lems. In separate questions, respondents were asked if
they had ever been told by a doctor that they had had
a stroke or have congestive heart failure. Finally, re-
spondents were asked whether they have ever had or
have ever been told by a doctor that they have arthritis
or rheumatism and whether they currently have
asthma.
While prevalence indicators such as these are com-
mon, measures of disease severity have been difficult
to obtain in health surveys and have rarely been inte-
grated into analyses (22). To begin to address this
limitation, we assigned one point for reports of the
presence of a condition and additional points for re-
ports of symptoms and medication use associated with
a specific condition. The prevalence, symptom, and
medication indicators that make up what we have
labeled disease severity scores are detailed in table 2.
We have used the disease severity scores previously in
the context of multivariable regression models of mo-
bility difficulty and found them to add considerably to
model fit in comparison with models that substitute
disease prevalence for disease severity (6).
As noted by Wallace and Lemke (22), the distinc-
tion between disease severity and impairment is often
ambiguous, particularly in social and health surveys.
Here, measures of symptoms of impairment capture
sensory deficits and pain without reference to a par-
ticular disease. Vision impairment has important con-
sequences for disability and functional limitation,
while the role of hearing impairment appears to be less
significant (23, 24). Respondents were asked if they
wear glasses or contacts and if their eyesight is excel-
lent, very good, good, fair, or poor (with glasses).
Respondents were also asked whether they wear a
hearing aid, how often (always, often, sometimes,
almost never), and whether they would say their hear-
ing is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor (with
aid).
Pain has often been thought to predict disability and
functional limitation as well but has rarely been mea-
sured. A recent review of experiments investigating
the reporting of chronic pain on health surveys, how-
ever, concluded that pain recall is quite reliable (25).
The Health and Retirement Study asks respondents
whether they are often troubled with pain, whether the
pain is mild, moderate, or severe when it is at its worst,
and whether it is mild, moderate, or severe most of the
time.
Our dependent variable consists of a five-point mo-
bility scale created from four indicators. Respondents
were assigned one point for each activity that they
indicated they had difficulty doing, did not do, or
could not do. The activities were as follows: climb one
flight of stairs, climb several flights of stairs, walk one
block, and walk several blocks. Cronbach's alpha for
the mobility scale was 0.77 among the low body mass
index respondents, 0.78 among the medium, 0.72
among the high, and 0.76 among the very high.

mass index categories. Second, we present the results
of multivariable regression models intended to assess
the association between chronic disease and mobility
for each of the four body mass index categories, while
controlling sociodemographic, health behavior, and
symptom of impairment indicators. By running sepa-
rate models for each body mass index category, we are
able to estimate the impact of body mass index on the
association between chronic disease and mobility dif-
ficulty. Statistically significant differences among the
partial regression coefficients for the different body
mass index categories are determined using t tests
(26). To be conservative, we noted only statistically
significant differences where the confidence intervals
of the two partial regression coefficients do not over-
lap. To limit comparisons, we used the medium body
mass index category in reference to all others.
RESULTS
Among the 1,150 African-American women self-
respondents, 20 percent had low, 38 percent had me-
dium, 24 percent had high, and 18 percent had very
high body mass indexes. As shown in table 1, the
mean body mass index among the very high category
was 40. The very high body mass index women tended
to have had more children and to have had fewer years
of education than did those with a body mass index in
the medium range. The mothers of the respondents in
the high and very high body mass index categories
averaged 0.7 year of education less and the fathers
averaged one full year of education less than did the
mothers of the respondents in the medium category.
Twenty-eight percent of those in the very high cate-
gory earned less than 10,000 dollars per year, and 44
percent had fewer than 10,000 dollars in net worth.
This was significantly different from the medium cat-
egory, where the percentages were 16 and 36, respec-
tively. The percent working is similar across all weight
categories except the very high category, where it is 15
percentage points lower. Those in the high category
are slightly less likely to reside in the South than those
in the medium category, while those in the low cate-
gory have higher CAGE scores on average than those
in the medium category. Finally, those in the high and
very high weight categories are considerably less
likely to be current smokers than those in the medium
category and are slightly less likely to participate in
light physical activities.
As shown in table 2, 91 percent of those in the very
high weight category reported at least one chronic
illness, and the prevalences and severities of hyperten-
sion, diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis were all
substantially and significantly greater among the very
high category in comparison with the medium cate-

gory. Hypertension was 1.5 times more prevalent
within trie very high category in comparison with the
medium category. Diabetes was two times more prev-
alent among those in the very high category, and those
in the high category also had greater diabetes preva-
lence than those in the medium category. Heart disease
is 1.9 times more prevalent and arthritis is 1.6 times
more prevalent among those in the very high category
in comparison with those in the medium category.
Interestingly, despite being one third less likely to
currently smoke than those in the medium category,
those in the very high category are nearly 1.5 times
more likely to report having been told they have
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma.
The disease severity scores did not follow a propor-
tionate dose-response pattern. In other words, although
disease severity increased in the expected direction
across the body mass index categories, the increases
were not uniform. The arthritis severity score, for
example, is 12 percent greater among those in the
medium category in comparison with those in the low
category, 20 percent greater in the high compared with
the medium category, and 54 percent greater among
those in the very high category in comparison with
those in the high category. Similarly, the diabetes
severity score increases by 33 percent from low to
medium, 43 percent from medium to high, and 69
percent from high to very high. Similar patterns are
apparent for hypertension, heart disease, cancer, and
mobility difficulty.
There is also a considerably greater percentage of
severe pain reports, both daily and when at its worst,
among those in the very high category. In fact, reports
of severe pain are well over two times more common
among those in the very high category than among
those in any of the other categories. Ratings of fair or
poor eyesight are also considerably more common
among those in the very high category. A majority of
persons in all obesity categories reported some mobil-
ity difficulty, but mobility difficulty is significantly
more prevalent among the high and very high catego-
ries than in the medium category. The prevalence of
mobility difficulty among those with body mass in-
dexes in the low range was 0.57, while it was 0.62,
0.76, and 0.86 among those with medium, high, and
very high body mass index categories, respectively.
Because the level of difficulty among those with dif-
ficulty is also greater among those in the very high
category (table 2), the overall mobility scores for those
in the very high category are significantly greater than
those for the medium body mass index respondents.
Table 3 represents the results of the multivariable
linear regression of mobility difficulty among each of
the four body mass index categories. To keep the ratio

of cases to independent variables at or above 10 to 1
(27), and to avoid multicollinearity and overly sim-
plistic causal assumptions, we excluded working sta-
tus, physical activity, daily pain, and southern geo-
graphic residence from the models of table 3. With the
exception of an increase in the coefficient for income
with working status excluded, sensitivity analyses in-
dicated that the exclusion of these variables did not
alter the estimates of included variables.
For the sample as a whole (table 3), income, pain at
its worst, fair or poor vision, and disease severity
scores for hypertension, diabetes, respiratory disease,
and heart disease were significantly associated with
mobility difficulty. Of these, heart disease, diabetes,
arthritis, and pain account for 90 percent of the vari-
ance explained by the model. Comparing results
across all of the models reveals that only arthritis
severity and reports of pain at its worst have a statis-
tically significant association with mobility within
each of the body mass index categories.
Age, currently smoking, diabetes severity score,
pain at its worst, and fair or poor vision were the only
partial regression coefficients for which t tests (not
shown) indicated statistically significant differences
between the medium weight category and any other
category. Mobility difficulty scores had a strong sig-
nificant association with age (range, 30-70 years)
among those in the very high weight category, but age
had no association with mobility among those in the
medium weight category (or any other category). Cur-
rently smoking and fair or poor vision had stronger
associations among those in the high weight category

in comparison with those in the medium weight cate-
gory. Pain at its worst had a lower association among
those in the high and low categories than among those
in the medium category, while diabetes scores had
lower associations among those in the high and very
high categories. In sum, it does not appear that chronic
diseases have a stronger association with mobility
difficulty among African-American women with body
mass indexes of 30-34 or 35 or over in comparison
with those with body mass indexes of less than 30. The
relatively high rates of mobility difficulty observed
among the very high body mass index group appear to
be more likely a result of relatively high chronic
disease prevalence and severity than due to a dispro-
portionate impact of these on mobility.
DISCUSSION
There are several limitations to this report that must
be kept in mind. First, the data used for this report are
cross-sectional. While there is plenty of evidence to
conclude that obesity increases the likelihood of de-
veloping a chronic disease, the possibility exists that
chronic disease leads to obesity through lifestyle ad-
aptations, adverse coping mechanisms, or physiologic
changes. As more waves of the Health and Retirement
Study are completed, these relations can be tested and
reciprocal associations identified. Second, the Health
and Retirement Study is representative of the respon-
dents aged 51-61 years but not of those falling outside
this age range. We have included those outside the
range of 51-61 years to maximize the sample size. We
ran the models with only those in the 51-61 range and
did not find the estimates to be significantly different
from those shown here. Third, we made multiple com-
parisons in tables 1 and 2, and a few of the differences
could have been due to chance. Fourth, the disease
prevalence measures are based on self-report, and er-
ror in reporting could have led to imprecise classifi-
cations of disease or body mass index. Fifth, the use of
imputed data is likely to have artificially lowered the
variance of the net worth and income measures. Our
use of indictor variables for low net worth and low
income should have minimized the impact of imputa-
tion on the estimates obtained in the multivariate mod-
els.
Sixth, the indicator for arthritis is not specific re-
garding the type or location of arthritis. This lack of
specificity may explain why we found no evidence to
support the hypothesis that mobility difficulty is more
strongly associated with arthritis among the obese.
Previous studies have found that obesity exacerbates
the disabling effects of knee arthritis among older
adults in general. Our inability to show a differential
impact (or association) of arthritis by obesity status
may be due to our inability to identify the location(s)
of the arthritis (8, 28). Our use of a disease severity
score in place of a simple disease prevalence indicator
may have also reduced the likelihood of finding dif-
ferential associations by body mass index, although
replacing severity with prevalence (data not shown)
did not yield differential associations either.
Finally, the disease severity scores created with
these data represent an interesting approach, but alter-
native assignments and scoring algorithms are cer-
tainly possible. Although we have used these scores in
other analyses and found them to add considerably to
model fit statistics, the predictive validity of the scores
has not been established. With the availability of
Health and Retirement Study follow-up data, we will
be able to test the ability of the scores to predict
adverse events and health services use.
Some authors have speculated that the association
between obesity and health risks may be weak among
African-American women (1). Our findings do not
support this conclusion. Although the association be-
tween mobility and chronic disease was not greater
among those in the very high body mass index cate-
gory, disease prevalence and severity, pain, and mo-
bility difficulty were much more frequent. The arthri-
tis disease severity score, for example, was 85 percent
greater, and the mobility difficulty score was 75 per-
cent greater among those in the very high body mass
index category in comparison with those in the me-
dium body mass index category. Similar patterns were
apparent for most other disease severity scores.
There are a couple of findings in these data and this
report that merit particular mention for their potential
to affect future efforts of disability prevention among
African-American women. First, none of the compar-
isons between the low (i.e., ideal) and medium body
mass index categories yielded statistically significant
differences. The medium body mass index category of
25-29 in this report is often considered moderately
obese (16), but the lack of significant differences be-
tween "normal" and "moderately" obese respondents
on any of the prevalence or severity indicators, includ-
ing mobility difficulty, suggests that the impact of
moderate obesity on disability may be minimal among
African-American women.
Second, those with very high body mass indexes of
35 or over had disproportionately high rates of chronic
disease and nearly universal mobility difficulty.
Weight loss and treatment may thus be most valuable
as a tool for disability management or prevention
when targeting individuals with very high body mass
indexes. Weight loss has proven to be very difficult
and expensive, however (29, 30), and identifying in-
dividuals at risk for developing severe obesity and
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 145, No. 10, 1997
Chronic Disease and Mobility across Body Mass Index Categories 875
attempting to prevent its development may prove to be
the more effective strategy for disability prevention
and management. Future studies should help to iden-
tify appropriate targets of obesity and disability pre-
vention, which represent critical and growing public
health concerns (31, 32).
