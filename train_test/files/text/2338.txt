What The Oregon Health Study
Can Tell Us About Expanding
Medicaid
ABSTRACT The recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
includes a major expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults in 2014.
This paper describes the Oregon Health Study, a randomized controlled
trial that will be able to shed some light on the likely effects of such
expansions. In 2008, Oregon randomly drew names from a waiting list
for its previously closed public insurance program. Our analysis of
enrollment into this program found that people who signed up for the
waiting list and enrolled in the Oregon Medicaid program were likely to
have worse health than those who did not. However, actual enrollment
was fairly low, partly because many applicants did not meet eligibility
standards.
One of the primary components of
the recently enacted health re-
form law, the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act of 2010,
is a major expansion of Medicaid,
particularly to low-income adults. The probable
impact of such an expansion on the newly
covered population is of obvious interest. This
articledescribes an ongoing Medicaid expansion
experiment in Oregon that provides a unique
opportunity to investigate its impact through
randomized evaluation.
For a limited time in early 2008, Oregon had a
reservation list (a waiting list) for enrollment in
its previously closed program that expanded
Medicaid coverage to low-income adults. More
than 85,000 people put their names on the list,
but the state did not have enough funding to
cover them all. Between March and Octo-
ber 2008, about 30,000 names were randomly
drawn from the list, and those selected were
permitted to apply for coverage.
Oregon's coverage expansion essentially
amounts to a randomized controlled trial of ex-
panding public health insurance coverage for
low-income adults. Those not selected from
the list provide a control group for those who
were.Working closely with Oregon's Division of
Medical Assistance Programs and the Office for
Oregon HealthPolicy and Research, welaunched
the Oregon Health Study--a multiprong re-
search effort designed to measure the effects
of this expansion on myriad outcomes. To our
knowledge, the study is the first randomized
controlled trial on the effects of covering the
formerly uninsured. In this paper we describe
the Oregon experiment--and some of our
planned analyses--in more detail.
The parallel between the Oregon expansion
and the new federally mandated expansion
makes the results of our study particularly
timely. Of course, the populations affected in
Oregon and nationally, as well as the enrollment
process, differ in important ways. Caution is thus
warranted in generalizing results from our study
to other settings.
Two issues discussed below are worth high-
lighting at the outset. First, Oregon is different
from the rest of the country. For instance, its
population is whiter, and it has demonstrated
a particular interest in Medicaid policy innova-
tion. Second, enrollment in the Oregon Medic-
aid expansion was voluntary. There was no
mandate like the one for individuals to purchase

insurance in the federal health reform legisla-
tion. Take-up of coverage was low among the
people selected from the list.
Low take-up, or a relatively small portion of
selected individuals who acquire insurance, does
not pose a problem for causal inference within
the confines of our study. However, it does sug-
gest caution in applying our results to a manda-
tory expansion. In that case, even with imperfect
enforcement, we might expect substantially
higher take-up. Furthermore, different types of
people would gain coverage if there were a man-
date for everyone to do so.
Previous Research
A large amount of scholarly research has exam-
ined the impact of insurance on health outcomes
and the use of health care. Broadly speaking, this
research fits into three main categories: obser-
vational studies, quasi-experimental studies,
and randomized experiments.
Observational Studies Hundreds of obser-
vational studies over the past several decades
have compared the health of and health care
use by insured and uninsured populations. The
Institute of Medicine (IOM) reviewed this liter-
ature and reported that the lack of health insur-
ance leads to thousands of preventable deaths
each year in the United States.1 The studies col-
lectively suggest that expanding insurance cov-
erage is critically important to improving public
health.2 Yet there remains much debate about
the relationship between health spending and
health outcomes.3­5
Some reviewers have pointed out limitations
in the literature from the observational stud-
ies.6,7 In particular, few of the studies effectively
controlled for underlying differences in health
status and other characteristics between unin-
sured and insured patients. If the two groups
are different in unobserved ways, whether or
not they have insurance might not be the cause
of their different outcomes.
Quasi-Experimental Studies Quasi-experi-
mental studies rely on differences in the avail-
ability of public insurance, or other policy
changes, to assess thecausal effects of insurance.
For example, variation across time and space in
state Medicaid expansions allows researchers to
try to assess the effects of such expansions.
The effects have been mixed. Some studies
have found evidence that public health insurance
reduces mortality among infants and children8­10
and improves some outcomes--although not
mortality--among the elderly.11­14 Although they
are much more persuasive than observational
studies, quasi-experimental studies are not truly
randomized. Thus, investigators must rely on
the assumption that the people whose health
insurance was affected by environmental or pol-
icy changes are otherwise identical to the people
in the comparison group.
Randomized Experiments A randomized ex-
periment provides a particularly compelling way
of assessing the causal impact of health insur-
ance. The random assignment of people into
either the treatment or the control group means
that the groups' characteristics do not differ sys-
tematically, except for the variable being stud-
ied: in this case, the presence or absence of
health insurance. Researchers can thus be sure
that the variable is causing any differences. Of
course, randomized experiments have their lim-
itations, some of which we detail below in the
context of our study.
Before ours, there was only one randomized
study of health insurance in the United States:
the RAND Health Insurance Experiment of the
mid-1970s.15 This federally funded experiment
randomly assigned participants to plans with
varying amounts for copayments and maximum
out-of-pocket spending limits. Researchers fol-
lowed the participants for three to five years,
collecting biometric health measures such as
blood pressure.
The strength of the experimental design is
partly responsible for the enduring impact of
the RAND study, which remains a standard refer-
ence in the health insurance literature. However,
the study also has two key limitations for current
policy analysis. First, it ended more than twenty-
five years ago, and health care was very different
then. Second, it was designed to measure the
impact of insurance generosity, not the impact
of having any insurance at all. No one in the
RAND study was assigned to a "no coverage"
group. The maximum out-of-pocket exposure
for participants was $1,000.
Whether insurance with lower cost sharing
leads to improved health is an important ques-
tion. But it is very different from the one that our
study asks: What are the effects of having health
insurance?
The Oregon Reservation List
Oregon's Medicaid program, the Oregon Health
Plan, has two separate parts. Oregon Health Plan
Plus is for the categorically eligible Medicaid
population, which includes groups such as
low-income children, pregnant women, welfare
recipients, and poor elderly and disabled popu-
lations. Oregon Health Plan Standard is for poor
adults who are financially but not categorically
eligible for the Plus program. The Standard pro-
gram, which is the subject of our study, provides
relatively comprehensive benefits with no con-

sumer cost sharing and minimal premiums.16,17
Eligibility for the Standard plan is limited to
adults ages 19­64 who are Oregon residents and
U.S. citizens or legal immigrants, and who have
been without health insurance for at least six
months, have incomes below the federal poverty
level, and have less than $2,000 in assets.
Budgetary shortfalls forced the closure of the
standard plan to new enrollment in 2004. In
early 2008 the state determined that it had the
resources to enroll an additional 10,000 adults.
Because Oregon's Department of Human Ser-
vices correctly anticipated that the demand for
the program would far exceed the new slots, the
agency received permission from the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to open a
waiting list and randomly draw names from it to
determine who would be offered the opportunity
to enroll. This process was chosen because it
gave everyone on the list an equal opportunity
to be selected.18
Thanks to an aggressive outreach campaign,
by the February 29, 2008, deadline more than
85,000 people were on the list.19
To sign up, people had to provide their name,
date of birth, sex, address, telephone number,
and preferred language of communication. En-
rollment forms were available in English and
Spanish. People were also asked to list the name,
sex, and date of birth of anyone age nineteen or
older in the household whom they wished to add
to the reservation list.20
We used this information to exclude from our
study population anyone who gave an address
outside of Oregon, was born before 1944 or after
1989, had enrolled in the plan as of Janu-
ary 2008, gave an institutional address, or was
signed up by an unrelated third party. Those
signed up by a third party were not likely to be
eligible or to enroll. These exclusions left us with
a sample of more than 70,000.
Drawings of 3,000­6,000 names from the
waiting list were conducted monthly from March
to October 2008. People whose names were
drawn were eligible to apply for Oregon Health
Plan Standard coverage and were sent applica-
tion materials. Everyone received a two-page ap-
plication form; it could be accompanied by up to
eight supplemental forms.
The main form asked for the names of all
household members applying for coverage and
inquired about their Oregon residence, U.S. cit-
izenship, insurance coverage over the past six
months, household income over the past two
months, and assets. Documentation of identity
and citizenship and proof of income had to be
returned with the completed form.21
Those who submitted the required paperwork
and met the eligibility criteria were enrolled in
the plan. All enrolled individuals had to recertify
their eligibility every six months.
The Oregon Health Study
For the Oregon Health Study, which is ongoing,
we are collecting data from several sources to
compare the "treatment group"--in other words,
the 29,411 people whose names were randomly
drawn from the waiting list--and the control
group, drawn from those who were not selected
from the list using the same random selection
procedure. We will assess the causal effects of
coverage expansions on a wide range of out-
comes, including access to and use of health
care, household finances and medical debt,
health behaviors, physical and mental health
outcomes, labor-market outcomes, and other
measures of well-being.
The analysis will help us shed light not just on
the impacts of insurance on health and well-
being, but on the channels through which health
insurance affects outcomes.We hope to examine
variations in subpopulations of particular inter-
est, such as the elderly and those in poor health.
Data Sources
The Oregon Health Study will rely on three pri-
mary data sources: mail and telephone surveys,
in-person interviews and health screenings, and
administrative records. Data collection began in
the summer of 2008 and will continue at least
through late 2010.
Mail And Phone Surveys We surveyed the
people on the waiting list by mail and phone,
contacting those who were selected from the list
and those who were not. The survey included
questions on current insurance status and use
of health care, health care costs and financial
strain, health status, and demographic factors.
An initial survey in the summer and fall of
2008 of 29,172 of the people selected and an-
The analysis will help
us shed light on the
channels through
which health
insurance affects
outcomes.

other 28,381 who were not selected yielded a
45 percent response rate. We conducted a fol-
low-up survey of the same individuals a year
later, including additional efforts to boost re-
sponse rates, and we achieved an effective re-
sponse rate of slightly above 50 percent.
In-Person Interviews We began an inten-
sive effort to collect data in person in Septem-
ber 2009; the effort will continue into late 2010.
We targeted a randomly selected subset of the
larger study panel from the greater Portland
area. Preliminary results suggest that we will
achieve a response rate of about 70 percent.
We expect to complete more than 10,000
interviews.
The in-person data collection complements
the mail and phone surveys in three important
ways. First, the comprehensive set of interview
questions will give us a much more detailed pic-
ture of individuals' health and health care expe-
riences. Second, wewillcollect objectivephysical
health measurements such as blood pressure,
height, and weight, as well as blood samples
so that we can evaluate cholesterol, blood sugar,
and measures of immune response. Such objec-
tive physiological measures are particularly im-
portant because insurance may affect not only
health but also the likelihood of diagnosis and
thus individuals' knowledge of their health con-
ditions. In fact, the RAND study found effects of
health insurance generosity on objectively mea-
sured blood pressure when respondents did not
report any changes themselves. People may be
less likely to acquire insurance if they do not
know that they are sick. Third, the response rate
of in-person contacts should be much higher
than that of mail and phone surveys.
Administrative Databases We have worked
with the State of Oregon to match data from the
waiting list with data from various administra-
tive sources. Information on the applications
submitted by people who were selected from the
list allows us to investigate who chose to enroll.
Data on Oregon Health Plan coverage for the
entire list allow us to examine the impact of the
selection off of the reservation list on public
insurance coverage, and how this has varied over
time.
In addition, we have matched information
from the list with statewide data on hospital
inpatient services, and we intend to include
emergency department and mortality records
in the future.We can use these data to investigate
the impact of the random selection on health
care use and mortality for the entire list, as well
as to detect anydifferences inparticipationin the
other types of data collection among those se-
lected versus those not selected from the reser-
vation list.
Analytic Approach
The primary analysis will compare all of those
selected in the lottery (whether they were even-
tually insured or not) with those not selected in
the lottery (again, whether they were eventually
insured or not). This is the "intent to treat" analy-
sis common to randomized controlled trials, and
it provides an estimate of the impact of eligibility
to apply for Oregon Health Plan Standard that is
not biased by imperfect rates of enrollment.
We can also estimate the effect of enrolling in
insurance itself that is similarly unbiased, analo-
gous to the effect of "treatment on the treated."
Of course, enrollment rates among those who
are eligible still affect the interpretation of these
results: Our estimate of the impact of insurance
coverage applies specifically to the type of people
who gain coverage in response to being selected.
Caveats And Limitations
The randomized allocation of health insurance
allows us to overcome many of the difficulties
that observational studies face in drawing causal
inferences about the impact of health insurance
eligibility or coverage. However, two important
caveats must be borne in mind in interpreting
our analyses.
First, attrition within the study population
may contaminate the random design, if people
drop out of the treatment and control groups at
different rates. This is a particular concern for
those surveyed by mail, whose response rates are
lowest.
From this perspective, a key advantage of ana-
lyzing outcomes through administrative data
such as hospital discharge information is that
these data cover all of the individuals participat-
ing in the lottery. The disadvantage of the admin-
istrative data is that they do not span all of the
outcomes of interest.
However, we can use the administrative data to
estimate the extent of nonresponse bias in the
survey data. For example, for outcomes in the
administrative data that are similar to those in
the survey data, such as hospital utilization, we
can see if the effect of gaining access to insurance
is the same for those who responded to the sur-
vey as for those who did not.
Second, considerable caution must be exer-
cised in extrapolating from our estimates of
the causal impact of insurance eligibility and
coverage to other settings, including the recent
federally mandated expansion of Medicaid. Our
results are naturally most relevant for popula-
tions, insurance plans, health care environ-
ments, and enrollment mechanisms closest to
those in our study.

provide more details on who signed up for the
Oregon waiting list and who enrolled in the Stan-
dard plan if they were allowed to do so. We also
discuss the health care environment. These facts
shed light on the nature of the low-income pop-
ulation that sought insurance coverage and was
eligible for it.
Preliminary Findings: The Study
Population
To find out what predisposed people to sign up
for the waiting list and to see how representative
our study population is, we examined data from
the Current Population Survey (CPS), a monthly
nationally representative household survey of
the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized popula-
tion, for the period 2004­6; the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's)
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS) for the period 2004­7; and our data
from the list.
We compared characteristics of the low-
income uninsured adult population of Oregon;
the low-income uninsured population of the
United States; those who signed up for the wait-
ing list; and those from the list who responded to
our initial mail and phone survey (Exhibit 1). It
should be noted that some people in each of
these groups may have been eligible for but
not enrolled in public insurance.
Overall, the low-income uninsured population
of Oregon--the target population for the waiting
list--is roughly comparable to that of the United
States as a whole. The most striking difference is
that the Oregon population has more whites and
substantially fewer African Americans.
Individuals in Oregon who joined the waiting
list are somewhat older and appear to be sicker
than the overall target population. For example,
of those who signed up, about 30 percent report
having been diagnosed with high blood pres-
sure, 11 percent with diabetes, and 17 percent
with asthma. Prior studies of people enrolled
in the standard plan had very similar results.22
Thus, our survey respondents seem to be
representative of the plan's members in terms
of their health status.
It is not surprising that the older and sicker
members of the eligible population would be the
ones who most wanted health insurance, and
that they would thus be more likely to put their
names on the waiting list. But that finding does
suggest caution in extrapolating our findings on

the impact of insurance to cases involving a
healthier or richer population. Evidence from
the RAND experiment and other studies sug-
gests that the benefits of health insurance are
concentrated among low-income individuals in
poor health, such as those who signed up for the
waiting list.15,23,24
Although still low-income, people on the list
reported incomes that were much higher than
those of the low-income uninsured populations
of Oregon or the United States. In fact, only
61 percent of the people in our initial survey
reportedincomes belowthefederal povertylevel.
This suggests that some of those who joined
the waiting list may have been confused about
the program. Only households with incomes be-
low the federal poverty level are eligible for the
Standard plan. Another possibility is that the
incomes of this population are volatile enough
that people were uncertain about their future
eligibility.
The Health Care Environment
Another relevant factor in assessing the general-
izability of results from the Oregon Health Study
is whether the environment in which this pop-
ulation receives health care is similar to that in
other states.
Oregon is similar to the national average in
how many of its hospital admissions arein public
hospitals (just under 15 percent for both), and in
uncompensated care as a fraction of gross hos-
pitalcharges(6.8percentforOregonand5.6per-
cent nationally).25,26 Oregon has 335 physicians
per 100,000 residents, which is similar to the U.
S. ratio of 330 per 100,000.27,28
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sys-
tem data also show that low-income uninsured
Oregonians have an access gap relative to their
insured counterparts that is similar to that in the
rest of the country. Together, this suggests that
the consequences of gaining insurance coverage
for low-income adults may be similar in Oregon
and in the nation overall.
Determinants Of Health Insurance
Take-Up
The phenomenon of low take-up rates--that is,
low rates of participation--for social safety-net
programs in the United States is widespread. The
abundant research on possible causes has fo-
cused on the potential roles of stigma, transac-
tion costs, and lack of information.29
Although there are limited data about the take-
up of Medicaid among adults, some evidence
suggests that take-up among newly eligible preg-
nant women and children is under 35 percent
and that only 50 percent of eligible adults with-
out private insurance are enrolled.8,30­32
There are several reasons why we might have
expected higher-than-usual take-up in our set-
ting. First, members of this population ex-
pressed some interest in coverage by joining
the waiting list. Second, unlike standard Medic-
aid programs, Oregon Health Plan Standard did
not give people the option to enroll only when
they required medical care. People selected from
the list had only forty-five days to apply for in-
surance; after this period, they were no longer
eligible to apply.
Take-up is particularly interesting in this set-
ting because one of the standard explanations
for low Medicaid take-up is that individuals who
are not enrolled are still "conditionally covered."
In other words, they do not sign up for coverage
until they become ill or pregnant.30
Less than one-third of the 29,411 individuals
selected from the list ended up enrolled in
Oregon Health Plan Standard. Of those selected,
17,962 (61 percent) submitted applications, and
8,704 (30 percent) were approved for coverage.
Thus, there are two sources of slippage in take-
up. Almost 40 percent of those selected did not
apply, and about half of those who applied were
ineligible.
We explored some of the reasons for these
slippages using two data sources. First, our mail
and phone survey asked people who had not
returned their applications to indicate why. Sec-
ond, when individuals did apply but were denied
coverage, administrative data provided the rea-
son for denial. Combining these sources, we can
compare those who applied to those who did not,
and those who were approved to those who were
denied (Exhibit 2).
Of course, an important caveat here is that
those who responded to our survey also appear--
based on administrative data--to be more likely
to apply and enroll than those who did not re-
spond. Therefore, our survey respondents are
not a random sample of those who did not enroll
in insurance. In contrast, the administrative data
contains all of the people on the waiting list,
whether or not they applied or enrolled.
There are clearly still
barriers to enrollment,
even among those who
are eligible.

Not surprisingly, individuals who applied look
like they would be greater consumers of health
care than those who did not apply. They were
three years older than those who did not apply,
and, among survey respondents, they were more
likely to report being in fair or poor health and
having days impaired by poor health. Those who
enrolled were older and in worse health than the
general waiting list population, who in turn were
older and sicker than the low-income uninsured
in general.
Having income or assets above the limits of
eligibility was a major factor in both sources of
slippage. Applicants reported lower household
income than nonapplicants, on average--
$11,790 versus $15,064 (Exhibit 2). The same
is true for those whose applications were ap-
proved compared to those who were denied cov-
erage--$8,513 versus $15,255.
Of the survey respondents who could have ap-
plied but did not, 23 percent said that they be-
lieved their income or assets to be too high
(Exhibit 3). And 55 percent of submitted appli-
cations were denied on the basis of excessive
income or assets (Exhibit 4).
These results suggest that take-up among
those who are truly eligible for the program is
much higher than the raw 30 percent enrollment
among those who were selected from the list.
Calculations suggest that 19 percent of those

selected had income or assets above the limits,
while an additional 4 percent already had alter-
native insurance. This implies a corrected take-
up rate among the eligible applicants of 39 per-
cent, but this is probably an underestimate.
Those selected who did not return either sur-
veys or applications probably had rates of ineli-
gibility that were at least as high. Furthermore,
almost 10 percent of the surveys that were mailed
were returned because of bad addresses. A sim-
ilar share of applications may have been unde-
liverable. These additional adjustments suggest
a true take-up rate of about 50 percent among
selected people who were eligible and received
an application.
There are clearly still barriers to enrollment,
even among those who are eligible. Despite ef-
forts by the state to facilitate enrollment by those
selected, paperwork requirements seem to pose
a major hurdle. A third of those who submitted
applications failed to return all of the necessary
documentation in time (Exhibit 4). Likewise, a
third of those who did not apply attributed their
failure to not having completed the application,
finding the paperwork a hassle, or not having the
appropriate documentation (Exhibit 3).
Some of this shortfall may reflect actual ineli-
gibility, but that is unlikely to explain all of it.
There are indications that people who are more
comfortable with paperwork or more motivated
to get insurance coverage--for example, those
who signed up for the list as soon as they could
and who provided more complete contact infor-
mation--were both more likely to apply and
more likely to be approved (results not shown).
The imperfect take-up of Oregon Health Plan
Standard coverage by those selected from the
waiting list thus appears to be attributable both
to ineligibility and to difficulty obtaining cover-
age for the truly eligible. This is consistent with
findings from other studies that document the
barriers posed by complicated eligibility rules. It
also suggests that better information and
streamlined processes can increase take-up.33
Understanding the determinants of insurance
take-up helps put future results from the Oregon
Health Study in context. Our analysis should be
interpreted as estimating the effect of public
health insurance on those who would obtain in-
surance when offered the opportunity: people
who are likely to be older and sicker than those
who would not. Caution must be exercised in
extrapolating from our results to very different
populations, or to very different types of insur-
ance governed by different enrollment or eli-
gibility rules.
Conclusion
The selection of names from the Oregon health
insurance waiting list provides an exciting op-
portunity for research. It allows us to bring the
strengths of randomized experiments to the
study of the causal effects of expanding public
health insurance in a low-income population
with a wide variety of outcomes.
Both participation in the waiting list and take-
up of the program were higher for people in
worse health, who may be the most motivated
to obtain insurance. In addition, as the evidence
from the RAND experiment suggests,15 they may
be the most likely to benefit from insurance.
Take-up of the coverage was fairly low, partly
because not everyone on the waiting list was
truly eligible. That so many people with income
above the eligibility limit participated--and, if
selected, applied for coverage--suggests that
there is substantial unmet demand for health
insurance among those just above the federal
poverty level. These and future results from
the Oregon Health Study are likely to continue
to shed light on the large Medicaid expansion
now scheduled to take effect nationwide in
2014.
