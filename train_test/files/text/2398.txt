Abstract
Introduction
Excessive alcohol consumption is responsible for 88,000 deaths
annually and cost the United States $223.5 billion in 2006. It is of-
ten assumed that most excessive drinkers are alcohol dependent.
However, few studies have examined the prevalence of alcohol de-
pendence among excessive drinkers. The objective of this study
was to update prior estimates of the prevalence of alcohol depend-
ence among US adult drinkers.
Methods
Data were analyzed from the 138,100 adults who responded to the
National Survey on Drug Use and Health in 2009, 2010, or 2011.
Drinking patterns (ie, past-year drinking, excessive drinking, and
binge drinking) were assessed by sociodemographic characterist-
ics and alcohol dependence (assessed through self-reported sur-
vey responses and defined as meeting 3 of 7 criteria for depend-
ence in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition).
Results
Excessive drinking, binge drinking, and alcohol dependence were
most common among men and those aged 18 to 24. Binge drink-
ing was most common among those with annual family incomes
of $75,000 or more, whereas alcohol dependence was most com-
mon among those with annual family incomes of less than
$25,000. The prevalence of alcohol dependence was 10.2% among
excessive drinkers, 10.5% among binge drinkers, and 1.3% among
non-binge drinkers. A positive relationship was found between al-
cohol dependence and binge drinking frequency.
Conclusion
Most excessive drinkers (90%) did not meet the criteria for alco-
hol dependence. A comprehensive approach to reducing excessive
drinking that emphasizes evidence-based policy strategies and
clinical preventive services could have an impact on reducing ex-
cessive drinking in addition to focusing on the implementation of
addiction treatment services.
Introduction
Excessive alcohol consumption is responsible for an average of
88,000 deaths each year and cost the United States $223.5 billion
in 2006 (1,2). Half of these deaths and three-quarters of the eco-
nomic costs are due to binge drinking (ie, 4 drinks for women
and 5 drinks for men in a single occasion) (1,3). Binge drinking
is also associated with a myriad of health and social problems (eg,
violence, new HIV infections, unintended pregnancies, and alco-
hol dependence) (4,5).
It is often assumed that most excessive drinkers are alcohol de-
pendent. However, few studies have examined the prevalence of
alcohol dependence among excessive drinkers -- specifically
among binge drinkers. Access to such information is important to
inform the prioritization of strategies to prevent excessive drink-
ing and treat alcohol dependence. Because binge drinkers are at
higher risk than non-binge drinkers for alcohol dependence (6),
population-based policies offer an important way to prevent alco-
hol dependence. The clinical diagnosis of alcohol dependence is
based on criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men-
tal Disorders (DSM), Fourth Edition, and involves the assessment
of warning signs such as tolerance, withdrawal, impaired control,
and unsuccessful attempts to cut down (7).
Data from the 2002 New Mexico Behavioral Risk Factor Surveil-
lance System (BRFSS) found that 10.7% of excessive drinkers (ie,
binge drinkers, heavy drinkers, or alcohol-impaired drivers) and

8.1% of binge drinkers met diagnostic criteria for alcohol depend-
ence (8). A study of the 2001­2002 National Epidemiologic Sur-
vey of Alcohol-Related Conditions (NESARC) found that the pre-
valence of alcohol dependence among binge drinkers aged 18 or
older was 4.4% among those with 1 to 11 binge drinking occa-
sions in the previous year and jumped to 21.9% among those with
12 or more binge drinking occasions in the previous year (9).
There are no current estimates of the prevalence of alcohol de-
pendence among US adults based on patterns of drinking. The ob-
jective of this study was to update prior estimates of the preval-
ence of alcohol dependence among US adult drinkers. If most
binge drinkers do not meet the diagnostic criteria for alcohol de-
pendence, evidence-based policy strategies and clinical preventive
services may effectively reduce binge drinking in most cases
without requiring addiction treatment.
Methods
Sample and procedures
The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) is a series
of cross-sectional surveys of a nationally representative sample of
noninstitutionalized US residents aged 12 years or older in the 50
states and Washington, DC. Conducted by the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration, the NSDUH is de-
signed to assess the prevalence and correlates of alcohol and other
drug use disorders in the general US population. A multistage
probability sample was independently selected for each state and
Washington, DC. Interviews were conducted using a computer-as-
sisted personal interview and audio computer-assisted self-inter-
viewing to enhance respondent's privacy during visits to house-
holds and group living facilities. Respondents were compensated
$30 for their participation in the survey.
Data for this study were pooled from surveys in 2009, 2010 (re-
vised in March 2012), and 2011, and a restricted-use data set was
created for this collaborative study between the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention and the Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration. A new population weight was
created for this multiyear data set by dividing the original weights
for the single-year data sets by 3. This new population weight was
then used to produce annual average estimates of the US adult ci-
vilian noninstitutionalized population aged 18 or older. Weighted
response rates for the computer-assisted interviews were 75.7% in
2009, 74.7% in 2010, and 74.4% in 2011. The final combined
sample consisted of approximately 138,100 adult respondents
from all 50 states and Washington, DC. Further description of the
methods for the NSDUH has been published (10). This study did
not involve human research participants and was exempt from in-
stitutional review board oversight.
Measures
Past-year drinking was defined as consuming at least 1 drink in the
past 12 months. Excessive drinking was defined as binge drinking;
heavy drinking; any past 30-day drinking by respondents aged 18
to 20 (who are under the minimum legal drinking age) if not
already included in another drinking category; or any past 30-day
alcohol consumption by pregnant women (1). The NSDUH con-
sists of core and noncore questions. The core questions do not
change from year to year to preserve the ability to assess trends
over time. The noncore modules are less static and are asked in the
survey after the core-modules. Only respondents who reported
ever having an alcoholic beverage were asked the noncore alcohol
consumption questions. Binge drinking for men was defined as a
nonzero response to the following question in the core portion of
the survey: "During the past 30 days, that is, since [DATEFILL],
on how many days did you have 5 or more drinks on the same oc-
casion?" Binge drinking for women was defined as a nonzero re-
sponse to the following question in the noncore portion of the sur-
vey: "During the past 30 days, that is, since [DATEFILL], on how
many days did you have 4 or more drinks on the same occasion?"
Heavy drinking was defined as 8 or more drinks per week during
the past 30 days for women or 15 or more drinks per week for men
(1).
Alcohol dependence was defined as past-year drinking, 3 or more
(of 7) dependence criteria, and consuming at least 1 drink on 6 or
more days in the past 12 months (11). The alcohol dependence
questions in the NSDUH align with the diagnostic criteria for al-
cohol dependence in the fourth edition of the DSM (DSM-IV) (7).
These include tolerance, withdrawal, impaired control, unsuccess-
ful attempts to cut down or stop drinking, continued use despite
problems, neglect of activities, and time spent in alcohol-related
activity. The classification of alcohol dependence in this study is
based on self-reported responses to the NSDUH and is not based
on a diagnosis in a clinical setting or from medical records; there-
fore, alcohol dependence in this study is based on respondents'
survey data.
Sociodemographic characteristics assessed in this study were sex,
age group (18­24, 25­34, 35­44, 45­64, 65), race/ethnicity (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, American Indian or Alaskan
Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, Asian, 2 races/
ethnicities, Hispanic or Latino), education level attained (<high

ily income (<$25,000, $25,000 to <$50,000, $50,000 to <$75,000,
$75,000), and employment status (full-time, part-time, unem-
ployed, other).
Statistical analysis
We conducted analyses using SAS-callable SUDAAN version 10
(SAS, SAS Institute Inc; SUDAAN, RTI International). NSDUH
weights and survey design variables were used in the computation
of all prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). As
part of NSDUH's editing and imputation process, inconsistent or
missing data for the core variables and many sociodemographic
variables were statistically imputed using predictive mean neigh-
borhood imputation (12). Respondents with missing data on vari-
ables that were not imputed were excluded from the analysis;
however, item nonresponse for each of these variables was less
than 2%. Estimated weighted numbers are reported in thousands,
and sample sizes are rounded to the nearest hundred.
Results
From 2009 to 2011, the prevalence of past-year drinking among
adults was 70.5% (95% CI, 70.0%­70.9%), the prevalence of past-
month excessive drinking was 29.3% (95% CI, 28.9%­29.7%), the
prevalence of past-month binge drinking was 27.4% (95% CI,
27.0%­27.8%), and the prevalence of DSM-IV alcohol depend-
ence among all respondents was 3.5% (95% CI, 3.3%­3.6%) (Ta-
ble 1). The prevalence of excessive drinking, binge drinking, and
alcohol dependence were highest among men, those aged 18 to 24,
and those who were unemployed. Binge drinking was more com-
mon among Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders (31.8%;
95% CI, 24.1%­40.6%) and non-Hispanic whites (28.6%; 95% CI,
28.1%­29.1%) than among other racial/ethnic groups, but most of
these differences were not significant. In contrast, the prevalence
of alcohol dependence among current drinkers was significantly
higher among American Indians or Alaskan Natives (9.0%; 95%
CI, 6.8%­11.8%) relative to other racial/ethnic groups.
When evaluated by education, the prevalence of binge drinking
was significantly higher among those with some college educa-
tion (30.1%; 95% CI, 29.3%­30.8%) than among those with other
levels of education. However, the prevalence of alcohol depend-
ence among those with less than a high school education (4.3%;
95% CI, 3.9%­4.8%) was significantly higher than among those
with a high school education or college education but not higher
than the prevalence among those with some college. The preval-
ence of binge drinking was also significantly higher among those
with an annual family income of $75,000 or more (28.8%; 95%
CI, 28.1%­29.6%) than among those with lower family incomes,
whereas the prevalence of alcohol dependence was significantly
higher among those with an annual family income of less than
$25,000 (4.8%; 95% CI, 4.5%­5.2%) than among those in other
income groups (Table 1).
When evaluated by drinking pattern, the prevalence of alcohol de-
pendence was 10.2% (95% CI, 9.8%­10.6%) among excessive
drinkers, 10.5% (95% CI, 10.1%­11.0%) among binge drinkers,
and 1.3% (95% CI, 1.2%­1.5%) among non-binge drinkers (Ta-
ble 2). The prevalence of alcohol dependence was significantly
higher among excessive drinkers and binge drinkers than among
non-binge drinkers across all sociodemographic groups. In con-
trast, the prevalence of alcohol dependence was similar among ex-
cessive drinkers and binge drinkers across most groups except
those aged 18 to 24, among whom the prevalence of alcohol de-
pendence was significantly higher among binge drinkers (13.2%;
95% CI, 12.7%­13.8%) than among excessive drinkers (11.9%;
95% CI, 11.4%­12.4%).
Among binge drinkers, the prevalence of alcohol dependence was
significantly higher among men (11.1%; 95% CI, 10.6%­11.7%)
than among women (9.7%; 95% CI, 9.0%­10.3%) (Table 2). It
was also highest among binge drinkers aged 18 to 24 (13.2%; 95%
CI, 12.7%­13.8%); it then decreased significantly with increasing
age. Binge drinkers who were American Indians or Alaskan Nat-
ives had a significantly higher prevalence of alcohol dependence
than those in other racial/ethnic groups (28.1%; 95% CI,
21.4%­36.0%), as did binge drinkers with less than a high school
education (14.2%; 95% CI, 12.9%­15.7%), an annual family in-
come of less than $25,000 (14.9%; 95% CI, 13.9%­15.9%), and
those who were unemployed (14.8%; 95% CI, 13.2%­16.5%),
compared with those in other groups in the same sociodemograph-
ic category (ie, education, income, and employment).
The prevalence of alcohol dependence increased significantly with
the frequency of binge drinking in the past month, ranging from
4.3% (95% CI, 3.9%­4.8%) among those who reported binge
drinking 1 or 2 times in the past month to 29.8% (95% CI,
28.1%­31.9%) among those who reported binge drinking 10 or
more times in the past month (Figure).

Figure. Prevalence of alcohol dependence among US adult binge drinkers, by
binge drinking frequency during the past 30 days, National Survey on Drug
Use and Health, 2009­2011. Alcohol dependence for adults was defined as
meeting at least 3 of 7 criteria for alcohol dependence (ie, tolerance,
withdrawal, impaired control, unsuccessful attempts to cut down or stop
drinking, continued use despite problems, neglect of activities, time spent in
alcohol-related activity) in the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) and consumed at least 1 drink on 6 or more
days in the past 12 months. Binge drinking was defined as consuming 5 or
more drinks (men) or 4 or more drinks (women) during a single occasion in the
past 30 days. Data set used for 2010 was revised in March 2012. Error bars
indicate 95% confidence intervals.
Discussion
This study found that about 9 of 10 adult excessive drinkers did
not meet the diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence. About
90% of the adults who drank excessively reported binge drinking,
and the prevalence of alcohol dependence was similar among ex-
cessive drinkers and binge drinkers across most sociodemograph-
ic groups. The prevalence of alcohol dependence also increased
with the frequency of binge drinking. However, even among those
who reported binge drinking 10 or more times in the past month,
more than two-thirds did not meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol
dependence according to their responses to the survey.
The prevalence of alcohol dependence among adult excessive
drinkers and binge drinkers in this study was slightly higher than
the prevalence reported in other studies using the same diagnostic
criteria for the classification of alcohol dependence. A 2001 study
of alcohol abuse and dependence among US adults using the Na-
tional Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) -- the pre-
cursor to the NSDUH -- found that the prevalence of alcohol de-
pendence was 7.4% among men and 7.3% among women who re-
ported binge drinking (13). The higher prevalence of alcohol de-
pendence among binge drinkers in this study may be due to the
different time period as well as differences in the survey methods,
which make these estimates not directly comparable (14). The
former NHSDA was redesigned in 1999, and other changes were
made to the survey in 2002, which may have increased the sensit-
ivity of the NSDUH for identifying people who are binge drink-
ing and alcohol dependent.
Differences in the prevalence of alcohol dependence between the
current study and the 2002 study in New Mexico (10.7% among
excessive drinkers and 8.1% among binge drinkers) (8) are prob-
ably due to differences in the survey methods used by the NS-
DUH and the BRFSS as well as differences in the populations
studied (15).
Consistent with previous studies, binge drinking was most com-
mon among men, those aged 18 to 24, non-Hispanics whites, those
with some college education, and those with an annual family in-
come $75,000 or more (16). In contrast, alcohol dependence was
most common among American Indians or Alaskan Natives, those
having less than a high school education, and those with an annu-
al family income of less than $25,000. These findings may reflect
the known impact of alcohol dependence on many areas in the
drinker's life, including their ability to work and their productiv-
ity in the workplace. Reduced workplace productivity is the single
largest contributor to alcohol-attributable economic costs in the
United States (1).
The strong relationship between the prevalence of excessive drink-
ing and binge drinking is also consistent with the findings of pre-
vious studies (17), as is the higher prevalence of alcohol depend-
ence among binge drinkers relative to all current drinkers (8), and
the positive relationship between the frequency of binge drinking
and alcohol dependence (18). These findings emphasize the use-
fulness of screening for binge-level alcohol consumption to identi-
fy excessive drinking among adults, including those who are alco-
hol-dependent (19). The relatively low prevalence of alcohol de-
pendence among people who drink excessively also suggests that
most people who are screened for excessive drinking in clinical
settings will probably not need to be referred for specialized treat-
ment.
This study has several limitations. First, data for this study are
based on self-reported alcohol consumption, which tends to be un-
derreported (20). However, NSDUH estimates of the prevalence
of binge drinking among adults are significantly higher than those
from other surveys of adults, such as the BRFSS (16). In addition,
although the classification of alcohol dependence in this study is
based on self-reported responses to a survey, the questions used to

assess substance use disorders in the NSDUH have been found to
be sensitive and specific for identifying alcohol dependence
among adults when tested in clinical settings (21). Second, al-
though the NSDUH collects information from residents of house-
holds and noninstitutional group quarters (eg, shelters, rooming
houses, dormitories) and from civilians living on military bases,
the survey does not include homeless persons who were not living
in shelters, military personnel on active duty, and residents of in-
stitutional group quarters (eg, jails, long-term care facilities), and
the prevalence of excessive drinking -- including alcohol depend-
ence -- is known to be higher in some of these populations
(22,23). Third, the 2009­2011 NSDUH classified alcohol depend-
ence by using DSM-IV criteria. In contrast, the new Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Version 5 (DSM-5)
defines a spectrum of alcohol use disorders, and based on these
diagnostic criteria, alcohol dependence would be classified as a
severe alcohol use disorder. However, a study of patients with a
known substance use disorder found that the prevalence of severe
alcohol use disorders was only 0.5% higher than the prevalence of
alcohol dependence (24). Another study assessing the drinking be-
havior of the general population (using data from the 2004­2005
NESARC survey) estimated that the prevalence of severe alcohol
use disorders based on DSM-5 diagnostic criteria was only about
1.1% higher than the prevalence of alcohol dependence according
to DSM-IV criteria (25). Taken together, these findings suggest
that the use of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence
in this study probably resulted in only a slightly lower estimate of
the prevalence of severe alcohol problems than would have been
obtained using DSM-5 diagnostic criteria.
The findings of this study have important implications for plan-
ning and implementing public health interventions to reduce ex-
cessive drinking and binge drinking at the population level. Al-
though alcohol dependence is an important public health problem,
these findings suggest that most excessive drinkers are unlikely to
need addiction treatment. Studies have also found that binge
drinking, in particular, is strongly affected by alcohol policies in
states (26). The Community Preventive Services Task Force re-
commends several policy strategies for reducing excessive alco-
hol use and related harms that are likely to be effective across
many sociodemographic categories, including increasing alcohol
taxes, regulating alcohol outlet density, and dram shop (commer-
cial host) liability (27).
The US Preventive Services Task Force also recommends alcohol
screening and brief counseling for excessive alcohol use among
adults in primary care settings (28). However, recent studies have
found that these prevention strategies are underused -- probably
because of timing constraints, lack of training, discomfort with
discussing substance use, or insurance coverage limitations. The
uptake of alcohol screening and brief interventions might be im-
proved by offering health care providers more training opportunit-
ies and by including coverage for alcohol screening and brief in-
terventions in standard health insurance plans (19,29). A compre-
hensive approach to reducing excessive alcohol use that emphas-
izes the implementation of effective policy strategies and clinical
preventive services, similar to the Best Practices for Comprehens-
ive Tobacco Control Programs -- 2007 (30), might therefore be
expected to have a greater impact on reducing excessive alcohol
use and related harms than a more focused strategy that primarily
relies on the implementation of addiction treatment services alone.
