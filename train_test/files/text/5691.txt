Introduction
Central to the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act
(Scottish Parliament, 2014a) is the provision for a Named
Person. The Named Person is a state named professional
"guardian" who will oversee the interests of every child in
Scotland from birth. Initially, this professional will be a
health visitor and the Named Person baton will be passed
upward as the child grows, onto primary and then high school
heads or guidance teachers. This Named Person has grown
out of the getting it right for every child (GIRFEC) approach,
and it is hoped will improve services, help keep children
safe, and oversee the well-being of all children in Scotland.
Significant opposition against the Named Person has
developed in Scotland, seen most clearly with the No to
Named Person (NO2NP) campaign. Looking at those argu-
ing for and against this new initiative, it was noticeable how
far apart the two sides were, and indeed are. The anger at
NO2NP public events is palpable, as indeed is the incompre-
hension about how the Scottish government could introduce
something like this. At a number of these events, the Scottish
National Party (SNP) government is even described as being
fascistic, as if it is driven by some ideology that has resulted
in this Named Person being forced upon us.
This article has developed out of the author's involvement
with the NO2NP campaign. As a form of participant action
research, it was initiated by existing research looking at the
potential problems of early intervention. This examination of
early intervention was itself developed out of prior research
looking at the political nature of antisocial behavior legisla-
tion and the trend toward the regulation of public life. The
author was involved in discussions at the Scottish Parliament
before the act was passed examining the strengths and weak-
nesses of the Named Person initiative. Subsequently, discus-
sions were held with a variety of groups and individuals who
were opposed to the Named Person. Out of these discussions,
the NO2NP campaign was formed and the author helped to
organize and chair a conference on this subject and also
chaired numerous "roadshows" across Scotland: These pub-
lic events, the work with parents and parents' groups, and

Third Way Parenting and the Creation
of the "Named Person" in Scotland: The
End of Family Privacy and Autonomy?
Stuart Waiton1
Abstract
This article has been developed through the experience of working with the various organizations and individuals who have
been part of the No to Named Person campaign. The aim of the article is to understand the emergence of the Named Person
in Scotland and to explain the significant distance between legislators and policy makers and those who have opposed the
Named Person initiative. We propose that the key to understanding these divergent views is predicated upon profoundly
different views of the family, the collapse of the ideal of family autonomy, and its replacement with what can be described as
"third way parenting." Here, the meaning of the "Named Person" as laid out in the Children and Young People (Scotland)
Act 2014, and the opposing views that have been made against this act are explained. The "Named Person" provision in the
legislation, it is argued, has developed with the rise of micro-managerial politics, the construction of the "at risk" child and
the anxiety expressed about the early years of children, seen most clearly in the significance of early intervention policies.
Within this context, parenting has become problematized and increasingly understood as a skills activity requiring training,
support, and surveillance.

subsequent analysis of Scottish social policy documents
regarding this matter, form the basis of this article.
It is worth noting at this point the nature of the opposition
to the Named Person compared with those who were promot-
ing it, a difference that explains, in part, the gulf that existed
between the two sides. The groups and individuals in the
opposition camp were almost entirely made up of "old
school" types: Christians and Conservatives with a moral
defense of the family stood alongside socialists who opposed
the demonization of the family and the abandonment of
structural explanations and action by the state, with a variety
of liberal and libertarian voices arguing for parental rights
making up the triumvirate. This contrasted with the politi-
cians, medical experts, and child care professionals who
make up the bulk of those promoting both GIRFEC and the
Named Person. These groups it is argued here represent,
what we will call, the new class.
The objective of this article is to look at the Named Person
and to try and explain what it is and why this state guardian
has been created. The nature of the Named Person legislation
and the arguments against it will be discussed below but
more particularly there is an attempt here to understand the
Named Person as a reflection of the changing nature of the
relationship between the state and the family.
The State We Are in
This article attempts to follow Nigel Parton's concern about
the changing nature of state policies toward children and
families (Parton, 2006). Most particularly, it is concerned
with what appears to be a significant shift in terms of state
expectations about its active responsibility to create pre-
scribed "outcomes" in children and to develop a framework
of intervention around the broad category of "well-being."
Some of these trends can be understood with reference to
Alvin Gouldner's description of the new class--a flawed
"universal" class who stand above the soiled world of poli-
tics or moral contestations and use "scientific" methods to
developed mechanism for regulating society at arm's length
(Gouldner, 1979).
Christopher Lasch's work is also useful for assessing
what he saw as a trend in social policy for professionals and
experts to colonize the socialization process of children
(Lasch, 1977). This, he argued had a long history through
the 20th century, but was becoming more intense as society
attempted to deal with what Habermas called a "legitima-
tion crisis" (Habermas, 1976). For Lasch, the moral and
political framework for state activities had increasingly
become replaced by a process of law making. Law making
in a sense became a replacement for politics and morals,
something that Alan Findlayson argues became increas-
ingly significant under New Labour, at a time when politi-
cians found it difficult to change society through political
and moral leadership by engaging the "energy of the peo-
ple" (Findlayson, 2003).
Consequently, there has been a shift in politics and a
development of micro-management policies and initiatives
summed up perhaps most simply through the idea of "the
politics of behaviour" (Blears, 2004; Field, 2003). In part,
this has been influenced with the emergence of the "thera-
peutic state" (Nolan, 1998) and the elevated significance of
the emotional life of individuals, an emotional life that Frank
Furedi believes is predicated upon a diminished view of the
human participant and a universalizing understanding of
people (especially children) as being fundamentally vulner-
able and consequently, in need of support (Furedi, 2004).
This sense of vulnerability is assisted by what Lasch
(1979) described as a world of diminished expectations that
he saw developing out of the 1970s, a world with a decreas-
ing sense of human or social possibilities and as such a world
that became preoccupied by the mere need to survive. This
was a society, described by Furedi (1997), as one that was
increasingly dominated by a culture of fear--a culture within
which safety became the new absolute--a prism through
which an increasing number of activities, interactions, and
initiatives became subsumed and resulted in the growing
(best) practice of risk management.
Whereas past approaches to life and society by the "old
school" types were grounded in a belief in the potential to
transform society, or transform individuals or, for conserva-
tives, to uphold standards from the past. The new class, espe-
cially in its increasingly therapeutic guise, is uninterested in
traditions or with notions of transformation and has come
instead to be preoccupied with the need to micro-manage
behavior. Their forensic approach to family life consequently
becomes enamored with neuroscientific discussions about the
brain as they abandon any attempt to understand the mind.1
Managing the At-Risk Family
Critical concerns about social policies targeted at families
over recent years have addressed a number of issues regard-
ing the "colonization" of the family, the bureaucratization of
children's services and the emerging "risk management"
approach to parenting. Nigel Parton (2006), in his book about
Safeguarding Children (subtitled, Early Intervention and
Surveillance in a Late Modern Society), has described "the
emergence of the `preventive state'" (p. 6). This is a state that
has come to be organized around the protection of the "at
risk" child.2
This growing focus upon the "at risk" child has been assisted
by the "rapidly-growing number of features of modern life,"
such as food, sunshine, and technology, which are now deemed
to be "risks" (Lee, Macvarish, & Bristow, 2010, p. 295). Child
safety concerns are recognized to be widespread among the
public itself and concerns about the rise of "cotton wool kids"
has been aired (Waiton, 2001). More abstractly, questions have
been raised about not only the proliferation of modern day
"risks" but also more generally about the emergence of an
exaggerated "risk consciousness" that influences parental
Waiton 3
attitudes and professional practices (Furedi, 1997, 2001). One
of the outcomes of the growth of perceived "risks," the critics
argue, is that the idea of the "child at risk" has expanded from
a term used to relate to a very specific group of children to
become a category that is more generally "applied to all chil-
dren" (Lee et al., 2010, p. 295).
In addition, the growing tendency to understand areas of
life through the prism of risks has led to a form of risk man-
agement becoming a political objective with set targets and
outcomes being established within children's services. Once
established, as Lynne Wrennall argues, the inability to reach
these outcomes themselves becomes understood as a risk.
She notes, for example, that when discussing the "Trojan
Horse" of child protection, "The term `Child at risk' used to
mean, at risk of abuse or neglect, but it has now been rede-
fined to mean, a child at risk of not meeting the government's
objectives for children" (Wrennall, 2010, p. 310). For
Stephen Webb, the growing anxiety about child safety in
society and within policy circles, has taken on an internal
governmental dynamic, and risk management becomes
increasingly proceduralized (Webb, 2006).
Through the prism of "risk," objectives, ideas, and ser-
vices targeted at children and families have increasingly
developed around the need for "prevention." For Nigel
Parton (2006), the key change in children's services in
England and Wales is that prevention, rather than being a
fringe activity has been, recast and "placed at the centre of
public policy" (p. 6). This shift emerged with the wider trend
toward a more managerial, "less political" approach to social
policy--an evidence-based approach that "came to the fore
in the UK with the advent of the New Labour government,
who saw it as a pragmatic `third way' approach that tran-
scended ideologies of Left and Right" (Edwards, Gillies, &
Horsley, 2016, p. 1) This idea that "every problem in society
has an evidence-based solution" is arguably part of a "mod-
ernising, new managerialist approach to governance in which
social values and moral issues are reduced to technical ratio-
nality" (Edwards et al., 2016, p. 1).
The rise of managerialism and bureaucratic mechanisms
for relating to children and families has, in the last few
decades, developed more specifically with the growing focus
upon the management of risk or risks. This is arguably part of
the wider "survivalist" instinct, discussed by Lasch, that has
resulted in a society weighed down with concerns about pre-
venting harm rather than doing (political or moral) good. As
Parton notes, for example, increasing surveillance, potential
restrictions on liberty and mass data collection are all part of
a new "protectionist" approach that is predicated upon "inter-
vening at a much earlier stage' rather than a crisis manage-
ment approach" (Parton, 2006, p. 6). Indeed, to manage risk
and to prevent problems inevitably results in the desire for
early intervention that itself necessitates intervention based
on what would previously have been seen as lesser issues or
problems: If we are going to "intervene early," this means
that we intervene before a major problem exists.
Avoiding risks and being risk conscious, Stephanie J.
Knaak notes in her study of breastfeeding, is part and parcel
of what "good mothering" has come to mean to both profes-
sionals and mothers alike. It is the purview of a medical-sci-
entific discourse, she argues, in which authority is gained
through the ability to "define and monitor `risk'in parenting"
(Knaak, 2010, p. 345).
Through the prism of risk and the inevitable trend toward
early intervention within children's services, an "explicit
linking" has developed of the "minutiae of everyday parent-
ing practices" with what is understood to be the "good of
society as a whole"--something that necessitates further a
need for more "government policy" (Edwards & Gillies,
2011, p. 141).
For Ellie Lee, the construction of the child "at risk" has
resulted in parents being equally constructed as "risk man-
agers." She notes, "Attention has been drawn to the distinc-
tiveness of a culture that routinely represents `parenting' as
the single most important cause of impaired life chances,
outstripping any other factor" (Lee et al., 2010, p. 5). Once
parents are established as risk managers their behavior
becomes a potential focus for professional concern and
management. As a result, "parenting" becomes something
specific, something more related to issues associated solely
with the prevention of harm and with a professional under-
standing of risk avoidance. Indeed parenting itself is recon-
ceptualized as a, and possibly the most important, risk
factor.
The implications of these developments for The Family,
as an institution in its own right are significant, and we have
seen, over the last decade, clear indications that when it
comes to parenting, the hope and expectation is that families
will open themselves up to the support (and surveillance)
they are understood to need from professionals.
When the education secretary Alan Johnson launched
Every Parent Matters (Department for Education and
Skills, 2007), for example, the, "vital role of parents in
improving their child's life chances," was emphasized,
before Johnson explained that, however, "Traditionally,
parenting has been a `no-go'area for governments. But now
more than ever government needs to be supportive of par-
ents who are themselves increasingly seeking help"
("Fathers Told to `Dig In' to Bond," 2007). Most recently,
addressing the problem of social mobility and the claim that
"4 out of ten children are missing out on good parenting"
(Social Mobility & Child Poverty Commission, 2014, p.
40), the social mobility tsar, "Alan Milburn said it should
be `the norm' for families to be given advice on issues such
as reading to their children, imposing discipline and restrict-
ing TV viewing to tackle the scourge of `bad parenting'"
("Make Parenting Lessons the Norm," 2014). Noticeably, a
2011 paper by the Social Mobility and Child Poverty
Commission, promoting the need to normalize parenting
classes, was titled, "Opening Doors, Breaking Barriers"
(HM Government, 2011).

The anxiety about parenting, Macvarish argues, has been
accelerated through the expanding category of "abuse" and
"neglect." She believes that "behaviour which would once
have been regarded as within the range of family experiences,
such as children becoming overweight or parents getting
angry and using moderate chastisement," is now categorized
with reference to risk, abuse, or neglect categories (Macvarish,
2014, p. 88).
The problematization of parental practices has been
assisted, Furedi believes, with the emergence of a thera-
peutic culture and the understanding that there is an emo-
tional deficit in society that is more central to individual
and social problems (Furedi, 2004). Emotional tensions
have consequently been recast as issues of abuse leading to
calls for a "Cinderella Law" to punish parents who are
emotionally cruel to their children. Sylvia Hewlett and
Cornel West believe that the modern anxiety surrounding
emotional abuse of children developed first in the United
States with the discovery (and construction) of the idea of
"toxic parenting," an idea promoted by psychologist John
Bradshaw that led him to argue that 96% of families in the
United States were dysfunctional (Hewlett & West, 1998,
p. 138).
This focus on the emotional individual within British
families can be understood, in part, in relation to the "third
way" focus on the minutiae of everyday parenting that
neglected structural (political) factors and defined social
exclusion as a "purely cultural phenomenon, to be addressed
by changing the norms of parenting in poor families" (Clarke,
2006, p. 718).
With the declining significance of political ideologies, the
trend was for social policy to be increasingly focused upon
the individual and more particularly, upon the emotionally
constituted individual. One of the outcomes in the United
Kingdom was that there was a growing focus upon "the
manipulation of the child's immediate environment," and
with the hugely expensive development of the Sure Start pro-
grams in England, there was now a major government initia-
tive that targeted a section of the population--the
under-fours--"whose needs had previously been seen as
almost entirely the private responsibility of their parents"
(Clarke, 2006, p. 716).
In the United Kingdom, as we moved into the new millen-
nium, Tony Blair explained that if he had an extra billion
pounds to spend, he would spend it on the under-fives
(Parton, 2006). As Featherstone notes, this emphasis on the
under-fives was part of "New Labour's desire to redraw the
welfare state [through] an emphasis on investing in children"
(Featherstone, 2009, p. 2). As we have seen, this refocusing
upon children came with a growing sense of risk in society
and with a professional belief in the need to manage these
risks--risks that related to the minutiae of everyday life and
increasingly included a therapeutic understanding of emo-
tional dangers faced by children--dangers that needed to be
prevented through early intervention.
The Children and Young People
(Scotland) Act 2014
The Named Person is about the safety and well-being of chil-
dren and about creating a "joined up" service where there is
one single person who can be approached by a parent regard-
ing services. It is about better service delivery and part of this
service is to ensure that the general well-being of the child is
maintained and that the child is safe. This service will be
assisted by better data sharing between professionals. The
Named Person, being a professional who is in touch with the
child on a daily basis (such as a teacher) will also play a more
proactive role in watching out for the child's well-being and
will be trained to understand what "well-being" means helped
by the SHANARRI indicators developed through GIRFEC.
These well-being indicators relate to being Safe, Healthy,
Achieving, Nurtured, Active, Respected, Responsible, and
Included, and it will be a statutory responsibility for the
Named Person to oversee the child's well-being
It is explained in the Policy Memorandum to the Bill that
Children and young people from birth up to 18 (or beyond if
they are still at school) have a Named Person and that relevant
public bodies cooperate with the Named Person by sharing
relevant information with the Named Person where there is a
risk of the wellbeing of a child or young person being impaired.
(Scottish Parliament, 2014b, p. 15)
The Named Person, will be constantly updated, and have access
to data about all services or difficulties that a child has as they
grow, where there are "concerns" about the "well-being" of a
child. Indeed it will be a statutory "duty" for services (doctors,
police, social work, welfare agencies, etc.) to pass on this infor-
mation (Scottish Parliament, 2014b, p. 17). Subsequently, it is
hoped that the Named Person will be "in a position to intervene
early to prevent difficulties escalating" (p. 16).
This sharing of data, based on "concerns about well-
being," is a significant change from the much more specific
and previously required benchmark for sharing data based on
there being evidence of "significant risk of harm" to a child.
The Policy Memorandum explained that the role of the
Named Person is,
based on the idea that information on less critical concerns about a
child's wellbeing must be shared if a full picture of their wellbeing
is to be put together and if action is to be taken to prevent these
concerns developing into more serious issues. (p. 18)
The Named Person is embedded in the GIRFEC approach
that was developed out of a review of the Children's Hearing
System in 2004. GIRFEC's aim is to support children and
families by streamlining provision and getting all agencies
that have contact with children to work together to provide
better services and also to safeguard children, with, in part,
an understanding of the importance of early intervention as a
remedy for preventing problems in the future (Scottish
Waiton 5
Government, 2008). Consequently, it is believed that the
needs of children in Scotland will be better met and a culture
of shared responsibility will develop among staff in health
and education as well as social work.
Despite the real differences between family policies in
England and Scotland (Donoghue, 2011), in many respects
GIRFEC replicates the Every Child Matters (ECM) approach
developed in England in 2003. Both emphasize the impor-
tance of data sharing between agencies and the need to move
from a crisis management approach to one based on the early
years framework that prioritizes the issue of safeguarding
children through early intervention (HMSO, 2003).
Sir Harry Burns, the Chief Medical Officer in Scotland
until 2014, has been one of the most influential advocates of
early intervention through his promotion of the problem of
"health inequalities" (rather than simply inequalities). In the
introduction to Supporting Young People's Health and
Wellbeing: A Summary of Scottish Government Policy (2013)
he sums up the approach:
If we are to have the greatest chance of influencing the
determinants of health and wellbeing, we should focus efforts on
actions to improve the quality of care for children and families.
We should start by making efforts to ensure a safe and healthy
pregnancy, a nurturing childhood and support families to bring
up their children in a safe, healthy, supportive and stimulating
environment. Efforts to enrich early life represent our best hope
of breaking the intergenerational cycle of disadvantage.3
The Risk Management of Well-Being
A more detailed understanding of the GIRFEC framework
that underpins the named person can be gained by looking at
previous policy documents and publications explaining the
nature of "good practice"--especially good practice in terms
of the increasingly central idea of "well-being."
The measurement and monitoring of well-being has been
developed with the help of risk indicators, outcome signifi-
ers, and various ways of managing information about chil-
dren. The National Risk Framework, for example, is a
GIRFEC document, used to explain how to understand and
manage risks. It aims to "support and assist practitioners at
all levels, in every agency, to be able to approach the task of
risk identification, assessment, analysis and management
with more confidence and competence."4 It is now also part
and parcel of the framework around which the Named Person
will operate. There are 221 "risk indicators" in this risk
framework that are intended to help calculate a child's well-
being and a parents' inadequacy in this regard.5 These are
assisted by the Wellbeing Wheel, the My World Triangle,
and a Resilience Matrix. The GIRFEC assessment frame-
work also includes an explanation of collecting information
by using risk indicator forms; how to be a risk analyst to
understand the child's world and how to be a risk manager
(see Figure 1).
Explaining the underlying early intervention ethos behind
the framework, the report states that
Figure 1. GIRFEC national practice model.9

Named Persons, Lead Professionals and others then need to
project the future probability or likelihood of harm and to
determine if this harm is significant in nature or not. Projection
of probable risk of harm significantly also means that there is a
potential for error in terms of what we think may occur. This is
no small task indeed [emphasis added].6
There is a clear shift, in policy documents in Scotland, away
from the use of the term welfare toward the idea of "well-
being" as the basis of professional practice regarding chil-
dren. Looking at the consultation document regarding the
Children and Young People Bill, written in 2010, for exam-
ple, it states that
We are shifting away from a view of a child's and young person's
"welfare" that treats their health, education and safety in
isolation towards a more rounded view of their "wellbeing,"
where services are sensitive to all the factors that affect how
well children and young people grow and develop.7
There is an attempt to standardize the idea of well-being
and to develop forms of assessment by creating lists of fac-
tors that indicate well-being concerns. The Scottish govern-
ment has created a form with 308 well-being indicators or
signifiers (as they are called). Each SHANARRI category
has its own list--relating to being Safe, Healthy, Achieving,
Nurtured, Active, Respected, Responsible, and Included.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, for such a long list, some of these
signifiers are contradictory, many are subjective, and some
are extremely personal. For example, although the child is
meant to be safe, she is also to be encouraged to be curious
and explore her environment; another signifier asks whether
the child smiles and laughs a lot, another wants to know
whether the child is unduly anxious about the physical
changes taking place during puberty. A number of the signi-
fiers are reasonable questions regarding what would histori-
cally have been understood as neglect or maltreatment. Many
more, such as the three listed, could indicate something or
nothing about a child. A significant number of these well-
being signifiers also relate directly to issues of parenting--
does the child have a good relationship with family, is she
actively involved in her family, are they treated with respect
and dignity at all times, is their privacy respected, do they
receive regular praise and encouragement? Noticeably, many
of the signifiers are concerned with the emotional well-being
of the child and about how the child feels whereas others
seem excessively prescriptive, asking, for example, whether
the child is developing aptitudes in one or more cultural
activities and one or more sporting activities.8
Opposition and Analysis
The Children and Young People (Scotland) Act was not sim-
ply about the Named Person, it covered a large array of wel-
fare-related provisions, the vast majority of which were
supported by Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs)
within the Scottish Parliament. Some concerns were raised
about the Named Person aspect of the bill, particularly by
Conservative MSPs who eventually abstained. All other
MSPs supported the bill on February 19, 2014. Opposition to
the Named Person had also developed outside of party poli-
tics, among Christian groups, legal bodies, and a variety of
individuals and organizations representing parents. The basis
of this opposition is what we will now turn to.
Central to the varying forms of opposition to the Named
Person was a concern about the family being undermined or
ignored by the Scottish government both during the forma-
tion of the bill and in its content. Parental rights, family
rights, and issues of a loss of privacy were core concerns.
Below, we look at some of these key areas of concern and use
them as a basis to look further at the framework upon which
the Named Person has been established.
Family Valued?
A variety of parent groups, legal bodies, and individuals
opposed the Named Person initiative. A number of these
groups joined the NO2NP campaign. One of these, the
Scottish Parent Teacher Council's (SPTC), as part of the con-
sultation process, submitted a paper to the Education and
Culture Committee of the Scottish Parliament. A concern
they raised about the bill was that despite government sug-
gestions that the Named Person was about helping parents, in
their experience, few parents had actually been consulted
about the new initiative. Rather, through the government's
detailed consultation with various children's charities (who
work in the main with "vulnerable children") the almost pre-
set consultation framework related to children who were
understood to be "at risk."10
Concerns about parents' rights have also been raised with
regard to mass school surveys that have been carried out
across Scotland with both 9- to 13-year-olds and with older
children. As part of the GIRFEC framework, school surveys
attempting to analyze the wide array of possible issues
regarding children's well-being have been carried out in
Scotland, resulting in complaints from some parents.11 These
surveys have been carried out on the basis of the "assumed
consent" of parents (rather than actual active consent) and
have included intimate questions about family life and the
sex life of children as young as 9 years old. For example, a
mother from Milnathort, told the Fife Herald, "My 12-year-
old niece was quite upset when she was asked if she'd ever
had anal sex. She told me she and her friends stopped doing
the questionnaire then" ("Parents Shocked by New School
Survey," 2013). Other questions asked related to, "legal and
illegal drug and alcohol use, domestic disturbances, parental
approaches to discipline, weight problems, theft and weapon-
carrying" ("A Question of Striking Right Balance in
Surveys," 2014).
Waiton 7
Examining these surveys, Kenneth Roy of the Scottish
Review noted that "assumed consent," when consent is pre-
sumed if you do not opt out of a survey, is seen as an unac-
ceptable practice for surveying children by both the European
Data Protection Directive and the Economic and Social
Research Council. Despite this, the Scottish government,
Roy notes, has launched the new "ChildrenCount" survey,
which he believes will lead to a "massive national database
backing up the present administration's intentions to have a
`Named Person' for every child in Scotland."12
On the fundamental question of the Named Person under-
mining the family, the Faculty of Advocates argue that the
bill, "dilutes the legal role of parents whether or not there is
any difficulty in the way that parents are fulfilling their statu-
tory responsibilities." The SPTC likewise argued that the
Named Person framework failed to recognize the signifi-
cance of the relationship between the parent and child, or to
recognize that there was something special about this
relationship.
The Christian Institute which is central to the NO2NP
campaign has unsuccessfully launched a legal challenge
against the Named Person, with the basis of the challenge
being focused on the lawfulness of the universal nature of the
Named Person and the nature and extent of the powers of the
Named Person. Specifically, it questions whether this initia-
tive cuts across the rights and responsibilities of parents,
which relates to Article 8 of the European Court of Human
Rights (ECHR). More generally, a question is raised here
about the principle of subsidiarity, which is one of the funda-
mental underlying principles of the ECHR: This principle
(developed most fully after the Second World War and with
reference to Fascism and Communism) challenges the state's
presumed place as the only body worthy of value and loyalty
in society, thus situating the family as a "society in its own
right" with functions that should not be interfered with.
Interference in family life is protected against in law and
supported only when there is a "pressing social need" to do
so, related to exceptional cases of the "prevention of signifi-
cant harm to the child." Article 8 also ensures that parents
have the "possibility and right of effective participation in
any official decision making process concerning the care and
protection of their child."13
Maggie Mellon the vice chair of the BritishAssociation of
Social Workers and a critic of the Named Person scheme
believes that families are being ignored by the Scottish gov-
ernment. Examining the 84-page document that accompa-
nied the act, she notes that there was only one mention of
"family" in the entire document and that was in relation to a
care placement for a looked after child. There is no mention
of "families."14
Over time, an increasing number of documents have been
written to explain in more detail what the Named Person's role
will be in practice. Rather than quell concerns about the family
being undermined however, the more detail that is given, the
more concerns have been inflamed. Take, for example, The
Easy Read Guide to Getting It Right for Every Child.15 This
guide for parents attempts to give more easily accessible infor-
mation about the Named Person and gives a list of suggestions
or instructions regarding each of the SHANARRI indicators.
The examples include the following:
Your child is kept away from dangerous things such as
fire and traffic (Safe).
Your child eats healthy food, gets enough exercise, and is
happy (Healthy).
Your child wants to work hard, feels confident, and gets
praise (Achieving).
Your child knows they are loved and have daily routines
(Nurtured).
Your child plays at home, and outdoors and does fun
things with the family (Active).
Your child is treated as an individual, listened to, can keep
things private, and gets a say in things such as how their
room is decorated and what to watch on TV (Respected).
Your child knows about right and wrong and you trust
your child to do the right thing (Responsible).
Your child can be part of a group such as Scouts, Brownies,
or a football group if they want (Included).
At the end of each section it states, "People who work
with your child will check your child is safe" (or Health,
Achieving, Respected, and so on).
Another new initiative in schools is the Hopscotch Theatre
group's production of a story about Ms. GIRFEC and Mr.
SHANARRI, which includes two songs--the SHANARRI
song and the Rights song. Almost 30,000 primary school
children are currently being taught these songs that (in the-
ory) teach the children, through play, stories, and song, about
GIRFEC, the Named Person, and about their rights.16 As
well as causing consternation about the state indoctrinating
children by getting them to sing songs with lines that include
things such as "We can measure pride and pleasure," con-
cerns have already been raised at roadshows about children
coming home and telling their parents that they do not have
to go to bed, or that they do not have to do French at school,
because they have got rights.
Finally, it is worth noting that much of the criticism about
the Named Person has been directed at the idea of teachers as
Named Persons. However, a point often raised by those both
in favor or opposed to the Named Person is that for most
children at school it will be meaningless, in that teachers will
not be interested in minor issues and will only get involved,
as a Named Person, in more serious cases. To some extent
this may be the practical reality, although it also goes against
the very idea of the Named Person as someone who is over-
seeing the well-being of the whole child in all aspects of their
life and development. But at least in terms of actual assess-
ments, judgments, and interventions, there may be a reality
to this point, especially as no additional resources are being
made available to schools.

However, when it comes to health visitors as Named
Persons, every single child will have a Named Person directly
assessing them, and specifically assessing their well-being
needs as discussed in the Universal Health Visiting Pathway
in Scotland Pre-Birth to Pre-School document (Scottish
Government, 2015).17 Health visitors, including assessing
the general health of a child, will now have a duty to visit a
parent eight times in the first year of the child's life and
ensure they support and safeguard the well-being of the
child. Health plan indicators will also be used. These have
been "redefined" to include an "emphasis on wider family
health" (p. 5) There will be an expectation that the health
visitor will take a proactive "health creating" approach that
should begin with two pre-birth visits. On average, these ini-
tial visits, the visits in the first year and subsequent visits
should take between 45 and 60 min and will include breast-
feeding benefit awareness, the need to carry out a routine
enquiry for gender-based violence (which relates specifically
to violence against the woman and child and will be assisted
by the Domestic Abuse Risk Assessment Checklist where
abuse is disclosed), and routine enquiries about family
finances/money worries. Core issues to be discussed pre-
birth will also include preparing the mother and father for
parenthood, promoting attuned, sensitive parenting, raising
awareness about the value of talking, stroking, singing pre-
birth and the benefits of brain development, and raise aware-
ness about second hand smoke.
The GIRFEC practice model and the National Risk
Assessment tool are highlighted throughout this report as the
National assessment tools to be used, these tools, discussed
above include various forms and data monitoring forms
related to the 308 SHANARRI well-being signifiers and the
221 risk indicators. Essentially, the health visitor is no longer
just a health visitor but a Named Person and a monitor of
well-being, who, like the Named Person in general must,
ensure that "any risk or potential risk to child or parent/carer
health and wellbeing is identified /addressed early" (p. 10).
The health visitor as Named Person, following in the trajec-
tory already developed under GIRFEC, will be proactive in
their surveillance of well-being within a family home.
Assessing, judging, and supporting far wider areas of a
parent and child's life and relationship will be universally
carried out now with the help of the broad well-being indica-
tors and in part through the framework of assessing these
relationships through the framework of risk and the potential
need for early intervention. Unlike in education, where there
are no additional resources for the Named Person, there is to
be a significant increase in the funding for health visitors
with a planned additional 500 new health visitor posts being
created in Scotland.
Privacy?
Major concerns were also raised about the sharing of data with
and by the Named Person. Having more integrated services,
better partnerships, and collaboration is a key element of
GIRFEC. Better data collection and the use of improving digi-
tal technology, it is hoped, will facilitate this process--a pro-
cess that is central to the Named Person.
Part of the Named Person initiative means that all profes-
sionals coming into contact with children will be taught
about the SHANARRI well-being indicators. If they have
concerns that any aspect of a child's well-being is, or is at
risk of being, unmet, they have a duty to share this informa-
tion with the Named Person. The Scottish government argues
that information will not be shared without the child's or the
parent's permission and argue that data protection laws are
not being breached. The Law Society of Scotland however,
raised questions about confidentiality, specifically wanting
to know whether this sharing of information between profes-
sionals could undermine the trust that young people have
when disclosing information to adults.18
Concerns about the Named Person have also been
expressed by parents. This is something that may increase as
parents experience the impact of this initiative.19 Alison
Preuss, the organizer of the home-schooling group
Schoolhouse, has, for example, received a number of com-
plaints from parents about "Named Persons . . . trawling and
sharing children's and parents' health records."20 Elsewhere
concerns have been raised about who the Named Person is,
their right to receive copies of children's confidential medi-
cal records, and the threatening letters parents have received
warning them that their Named Person will be informed if
they miss medical appointments.21
The practicalities of data sharing are still unclear and
often only come to light through newspaper articles and let-
ters sent to the press about experiences parents have had.22
Lesley Scott of Tymes Trust, a charity for young Myalgic
Encephalomyelitis (ME) sufferers, who is part of the NO2NP
campaign argues that there is a fundamental problem with the
government's argument that data will only be shared if the par-
ent and/or child agree to this--and that is the question of non-
compliant. Are children, in particular, really in a position to
say "No" to professionals who want to share information
about them? From her experience of working with parents,
non-compliance, or refusing to accept professional judgment,
Lesley argues, "is the fastest way to get social workers inves-
tigating you as a problem parent." Lesley Scott's argument is
backed up by Jane Colby the director of Tymes Trust. In a
paper for Argument and Critique, Colby noted that many par-
ents end up being investigated by social services because of
suspicions about their child's illness especially when a parent
is seen as non-compliant, there have been 141 such investiga-
tion across the United Kingdom concerning "abuse or neglect,"
not one has resulted in action by the authorities. She notes,
We assert that for 100% of these families to be innocent,
something is gravely wrong with the methods through which
children with ME are selected to be the subject of Child Protection
investigations and with the conduct of these investigations.23
Waiton 9
Lookingatthe"riskindicators"intheNationalFramework
of Risk in Scotland document (the GIRFEC risk indicators
that will be used by the Named Person)--being a non-com-
pliant parent can be associated with at least four "risk" signi-
fiers: parental resistance/limited engagement, refuses
workers access to child, parents masking the reality of the
situation, and no shared understanding of concerns.24 Parents
do not have to comply when a professional wants to share
information about them or their child, but if they do not they
could be labeled as non-compliant--a risk factor to their
child's well-being. As well as this, the Named Person or
other professionals could share information without the
child's or parent's consent if they believe that by asking for
consent the child will be put at risk. This again is something
that Lesley Scott believes is highly subjective, especially
when the extremely broad category of "well-being concern"
is the basis upon which a Named Person is meant to act.
Data sharing is important for health visitors in their role as
Named Persons, and the confidentiality of client's medical
(and other) records is changing. The Universal Health report
states that
After following the due process in the Act including seeking the
views of the child and normally [emphasis added] the parent,
sharing of information to promote, support or safeguard a child's
wellbeing with or by a Named Person's service will be a duty
even where there is a duty of confidentiality hence consent to
share relevant and proportionate information in this context will
not be required and if sought and refused could potentially
damage the HV/parental relationship.25
The duty of confidentiality here appears to be trumped by the
duty to share information. Indeed, one of the reasons you may
share information without getting consent is if you think that
telling your client that you wish to share this information could
"potentially damage" your relationship with that client.26
Finally regarding concerns about data sharing and "trawl-
ing" for information: At Roadshows there has been a lot of
skepticism from parents about professionals informing them
when they share data. A number of parents who have
demanded to see the information held about them and their
child (via SubjectAccess Requests) have discovered a signifi-
cant amount of data sharing that they were unaware of.
Parents have also raised concerns about "data trawling" in
schools. This relates to the numerous school surveys that have
been carried out across Scotland where children have been
asked detailed questions about their lives and their relation-
ships, including the nature of their relationships with parents.
Questions have also been raised about teachers themselves
trawling for information and using Circle Time to quiz chil-
dren about things they find embarrassing or worrying.
Discussion: Third Way Parenting
Critics have noted the problematization and professionaliza-
tion of parenting that is taking place across the United
Kingdom, and it is difficult to dispute the fact that the Named
Person, as a universal service for all children in Scotland, is
furthering this process--of both introducing professional
people and practices into the realm of parenting, perhaps
especially through the role of the health visitor--and through
this, elevating more areas of life into problems, or risks. The
very idea of early intervention is predicated upon intervening
in a child's life before problems get out of hand; and through
the well-being indicators, this necessarily means that more
minor issues will need to be taken seriously.
We mentioned Christopher Lasch's idea of survivalism at
the start of this article. This safety-based approach to life is
one that Nigel Parton has discussed at length with regard to
the safeguarding of children. With the Named Person's focus
on early intervention pre-birth and throughout a child's life,
this prevention-oriented approach takes the practice of "safe-
guarding" to a new level and pushes risk management to the
heart of parenting and professional practices.
Many of the trends discussed by critics of parenting poli-
cies, early intervention, and risk management approaches to
families, are evident in the Named Person. Indeed in many
respects, the Named Person is the "high point" of this
approach to families. Here, there is a high expectation that
support will be needed by parents and provided by profes-
sionals, where needs and risks are interchangeable and per-
haps most importantly, where the category of well-being
replaces that of welfare, thus incorporating the anxiety about
the (universal) "vulnerable child" with an ever increasing
concern about the minutiae of everyday life.
In the consultation document discussing the Children and
Young People Bill, it is noted that the duty of government is
to prioritize the safety and well-being of children. Scotland's
services can lead the way if we work together, we are told.
The key is to use the SHANARRI indicators, focus on the
early years, and to have a commitment to early intervention.
This was not simply an objective of those departments work-
ing with children however, rather, "These aspirations are the
foundations not just for this Children and Young People Bill,
but for our approach to government [emphasis added]."27
Central to this new form of government is the idea of gov-
erning well-being and of supporting people, especially chil-
dren. This is a development that fully took hold under New
Labour, as Featherstone (2009) noted, with the redrawing of
the welfare state through an emphasis on children.28 Welfare,
as the consultation document to the new Children Act
explained, was no longer an adequate or sensitive enough
term. Rather, we need to think about well-being and to be
aware of all the factors that affect how a child grows and
develops.29 And, we need to think about this through a pro-
fessional perspective that engages with parents and the
expert led understanding of "parenting."
The shift to well-being is important and appears to pull
together past welfare concerns with wider concerns about
safety (or risk) and a more therapeutic approach to the parent
and child. The term "well-being" itself has medical
10 SAGE Open
connotations and is one that is often associated with mental
and emotional "well-being."30 Well-being is consequently an
incredibly broad and flexible category demonstrated not only
by the long list of (308) well-being signifiers but also by the
comment at the start of this list, which explained that this is
what a child's well-being "might" look like. The word might
is used because there is no limit to the situations or behaviors
that could be analyzed through the prism of well-being.
Giving an idea of both the breadth of the category itself and
its emotionally therapeutic dimensions, when discussing
potential triggers that could be incorporated into the category
of well-being in the future, Bob Fraser, a GIRFEC health
advisor suggested that a lack of hope, love, or spirituality,
provided by parents, could and perhaps should be the basis
for action. This, he noted, would mean intervening with chil-
dren who are "not just the usual suspects, not just for those
that we identity as those in need" (Foster, 2015).
Critics of the couplet of early intervention and child pro-
tection, such as Featherstone, Morris, and White (2013),
rightly point out that family support now comes with the lan-
guage of intervention and prevention. They also argue that
this reflects a neoliberal policy that focuses on the poor and
blames them for their problems. We need to defend the moral
legitimacy of support for families and to recognize that this
is different from intervention, they argue. With the Named
Person however, although in practice it may well be poorer
parents who are affected the most, in principle this is a uni-
versal service for all parents and all children--"not just the
usual suspects." Also, it is not clear that this initiative can be
categorized as "neoliberal," certainly not in the sense of peo-
ple being expected to be responsible in any classically liberal
sense of the word. In many respects, the Named Person
expects a form of dependence from parents rather than
independence.
As we noted at the start of this article, there was a contrast
between the "old school" nature of the opponents of the
Named Person and the new class of politicians, medical
experts, and child care professionals who supported it.31 The
former is more traditionally political, moral, and concerned
about rights (as freedoms). The latter rarely uses moral or
wider political arguments or (ideologies) to explain their
case, but is rather more inclined to use a scientific and or
therapeutic language and to operate more technically and
managerially when developing support mechanism for par-
ents and children. These defenders of the Named Person
become irate when they are labeled as authoritarian and, like
Bob Fraser above, see themselves as caring supporters of
families and children, who they will often recognize, are liv-
ing in difficult circumstances.
This apparent anomaly can in part be explained by the
shift away from ideas of left and right or the move to a "third
way": a "new" (less overtly) political basis for developing
state policies and practices. Seen most clearly under New
Labour, and continuing to this day, this approach helped to
transform the meaning of things, assisted in part by the shift
to a therapeutic mind-set and one built upon a survivalist out-
look where safety and risk avoidance became more centrally
important (Waiton, 2008). Now what it meant to be respon-
sible changed, as did the notion of rights and the meaning of
support.
"Rights and responsibilities" became a couplet in the late
1990s, the former being transformed from (as the name sug-
gests) a right, to something that was given to you by the
authorities if you behaved responsibly. Here too, the mean-
ing of responsibility was transformed from something you
were fully accountable for toward a prescribed form of
behavior that was sanctioned by the state: You were respon-
sible if you behaved correctly, for example, if you were quiet
and did not upset your neighbors, and therefore, could be
allowed your rights. Often associated with a discussion about
crime and safety, the meaning of freedom was also trans-
formed at this time, with, for example, freedom being associ-
ated with the idea of freedom from fear: To be free, in this
context, increasingly meant being protected from those
around you often by new laws and powers being developed
by the state. In this respect, it was the authorities who gave
you your rights and freedom rather than individuals exercis-
ing them themselves.
In the context of the Named Person, we find that your
rights, as a parent are now more dependent upon your respon-
sible parenting, which is being defined by the new class.
Rather than challenging parental responsibility directly how-
ever, we find that what it means (or at least what the new
class means) by responsible has changed. A responsible par-
ent is now a safe parent, who must protect his or her child
from harm--where what is harmful has itself expanded to
include a new array of sins that are often related to health and
emotional well-being. In addition, to be responsible, as the
family policy documents above indicate, increasingly means
being "aware" and accepting guidance about the minefield of
parenting. Through the framework of well-being, a vast array
of parental attitudes and behaviors can now be assessed and
monitored, all within the parameter of being a responsible
parent.
Indeed, within this new framework it is noticeable that
old, structurally oriented ideas of inequality are now being
reposed through the prism of "health inequalities," a repos-
ing that shifts the governmental gaze away from wider ques-
tions of deprivation onto questions of behavior, attitudes, and
awareness, regarding forms of correct behavior in terms of
both your child's and your own physical and, perhaps more
importantly, mental/emotional well-being. In this respect, a
need for some economic transformation regarding the poor is
metamorphosized into the need for behavioral change among
those with health inequalities. The health visitor handbook
advises them to move to an approach that relates to "wider
family health." Here, activities (and indeed rights and free-
doms) in the private realm of the home are transformed into
quasi-medical, public policy issues to be measured and cured
by the new class.
Waiton 11
As we noticed above, the more caring adoption of the cat-
egory of well-being is predicated upon the idea that "wel-
fare" was not sensitive enough. At one level, this appears to
be a more empathetic perspective; at another, it reflects the
perception that we need to be more sensitive because people,
both adults and children alike, need more sensitivity. They
need more sensitivity because they themselves are sensi-
tive--they are fragile and as such need to be protected from
more aspects of life. At one level, this can be understood as
less of a caring approach to people, than an infantilized one.
A perspective based on the presumption that these "sensi-
tive" people cannot possibly cope without support.
The space for the growing development of experts and
professionals in family life has partly been provided by the
diminished sense of parental capacity, something that has
been assisted by the problematization and professionaliza-
tion of parenting (Furedi, 2001). It has become increasingly
accepted within family policy documents across the United
Kingdom, for example, to presume that it should be the
"norm," as Alan Milburn argued, for families to be given
advice. Indeed a key Scottish government argument, about
why the Named Person is needed, is that parents need some-
one to help them access services. But, it is rare to find a par-
ent who lacks the capacity to access the services her child
needs. It is much more common to find parents who know
exactly what they need but unfortunately find that the ser-
vices are not available for them.
The new class presumption of parental incapacity trans-
forms, in their minds, the very idea of rights and support
and the infantilized idea of rights comes to mean the right
to receive support from experts. Through this diminished
view of parents, the very idea of support and intervention
becomes one and the same thing. To cope alone, to be inde-
pendent, to take full responsibility for your family is a mis-
take, a fantasy and as such, to refuse this support is
problematic and must necessarily be treated with some sus-
picion: To be private, independent, and autonomous as a
family is now a barrier to the rights (read support) that you
and your child needs.
Conclusion
In an interview with a mother, Anne Cannon, who opposes
the Named Person makes the point that there is an assump-
tion that the state has a right to know everything that goes on
in the home. But this is not the case she argues. Children
need to know when they come home it is their home and
what happens here is private--"they have to know they're
safe." For Anne Cannon, the safety and feeling of safety that
her children experience is predicated upon the privacy pro-
vided by the family home--privacy she believes will be
undermined by the Named Person.32
In the end, it is the profoundly differing view of the family
that separates the NO2NP supporters from those who pro-
mote the Named Person.
In 2013, the minister for Children and Young People,
Aileen Campbell, who is responsible for overseeing the
Named Person initiative defended the new government legis-
lation explaining that "we recognise that parents also have a
role," in raising their children (Borland, 2013, emphasis
added). It seems unlikely that politicians from previous gen-
erations would have thought about parents or the family as
something who "also" has a role in raising children.
What has been lost within the new class is an under-
standing (or belief) in the central importance of individual
moral autonomy, something that is central to the under-
standing of the family as an important private "institution"
in its own right.
Historically, governments in the United Kingdom saw the
autonomy of the family and the privacy it provided, as
important. Furedi notes, "In the past, even radical thinkers
who regarded family life as stultifying still believed that a
private life was essential for the moral development of peo-
ple" (Furedi, 2004, p. 70). Today, the tension between state
intervention into the family and support given to it, and the
potential for undermining the independence of parents is
rarely present in policy discussions. At best, a nod is given to
the notion of a private sphere, before the centrality of privacy
and independence are gently pushed to one side: It is parents
not governments who raise children, we are informed, but
parents (all parents) need support. Replacing the agonizing
attempt of previous centuries to maintain family indepen-
dence (Ramaekers & Suissa, 2012), we get a plethora of gov-
ernment documents and initiatives promoting "support" as
the new norm for parenting. Indeed, whereas for the 19th and
(to an extent) the 20th century the ideal was to push the need
for self-reliance and autonomy, and to argue that "to patrol
the home was a sacrilege" (Cretney, 2003, pp. 628-695),
today in comparison, the state is more inclined to see auton-
omy as a barrier to the third-party support necessary to main-
tain risk-free relationships in the family.

firmed that this was at least her understanding of its meaning.

of children that were key.

30. In the Oxford English Dictionary, "well-being" is defined
with reference to "a patent's well-being." Other examples
relate to physical and emotional well-being, health, and
mental well-being. See http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/

31. It has been noticeable, at government sponsored events to dis-
cuss the Named Person, or in the documents discussing the
issue and press coverage about it that it is difficult to distinguish
between political and professional voices. Other than a small
number of Conservatives the Scottish Parliament, regardless
of the political party, were supportive of this initiative--it was
after all an initiative developed out of New Labour's GIRFEC,
first formulated in 2004. The consultation process itself has
been dominated, as the SPTC noted, by discussions between
politicians, civil servants, and various children's charities and
organizations that follow the GIRFEC approach--groups and
individuals who appear to be singing from exactly the same
hymn sheet. Even union organization such as the teacher's
Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), strongly supports the
well-being framework promoted through the Named Person,
which should perhaps be no surprise considering the teaching
professions general acceptance of a more therapeutic approach
to education (Ecclestone & Hayes, 2009).
