for Helicobacter pylori Infection?

Background: Genetic factors play a role or roles in the
etiology of peptic ulcer disease and the acquisition of Heli-
cobacter pylori infection.
Objective: To evaluate the relative importance of ge-
netic and environmental influences as well as the impor-
tance of H pylori on peptic ulcer disease.
Design: Cross-sectional study on monozygotic (MZ) and
dizygotic (DZ) twins, reared apart or together.
Participants: Twins of the subregistry of the Swedish
Twin Registry included in the Swedish Adoption/Twin
Study of Aging.
Measurements: Peptic ulcer disease and H pylori sta-
tus were assessed in MZ and DZ twin pairs reared apart
or together. A total of 258 twin pairs had information re-
garding H pylori status and history of peptic ulcer. Heli-
cobacter pylori status was assessed as the presence of
anti­H pylori IgG.
Results: The intraclass correlations for peptic ulcer dis-
ease for MZ twins reared apart and together and DZ twins
reared apart and together were 0.67, 0.65, 0.22, and 0.35,
respectively, which indicates that genetic effects are im-
portant for liability to peptic ulcer. The correlation co-
efficient for MZ twins reared apart (0.67) provides the
best single estimate of the relative importance of genetic
effects (heritability) for variation in liability to peptic ul-
cer disease, and structural model fitting analyses con-
firmed this result (heritability, 62%). The cross-twin cross-
trait correlations for MZ and DZ twins were examined
to determine whether genetic effects for peptic ulcer were
shared with or independent of genetic influences for H
pylori. The cross-correlations for MZ and DZ twins were
almost identical (0.25 and 0.29, respectively), suggest-
ing that familial environmental rather than genetic in-
fluences mediate the association between peptic ulcer dis-
ease and H pylori infection.
Conclusions: Genetic influences are of moderate im-
portance for liability to peptic ulcer disease. Genetic in-
fluences for peptic ulcer are independent of genetic in-
fluences important for acquiring H pylori infection.

DURING THE past 50 years,
the ability of investiga-
tors to identify risk fac-
tors associated with pep-
tic ulcer has been ham-
pered by the heterogeneous nature of the
disease. The prevalence and incidence of
peptic ulcer varies worldwide in relation
to geographic, racial, and social circum-
stances.1-4 There has also been some evi-
dence that genetic factors play an impor-
tant role in the etiology of peptic ulcer
disease.5-7 However, the pattern of inher-
itance is not simple mendelian and the ge-
netic basis is multifactorial. Risk factors
for peptic ulcer include cigarette smok-
ing and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drug use.1,8 Additional potential risk fac-
tors for peptic ulcer have been docu-
mented, including age, sex, alcohol and
caffeine consumption, stress, and diet.1,8-12
However, the results concerning environ-
mental risk factors for peptic ulcer are not
conclusive.
During the past decade, an associa-
tion between peptic ulcer disease and Heli-
cobacter pylori infection was recog-
nized.13-15 Because of the significant role
of H pylori infection in peptic ulcer dis-
ease, there has been substantial interest in
studying genetic and environmental in-
fluences (eg, socioeconomic status and
crowding) on acquiring the infection. It
has been reported previously16 that ge-
netic factors are important for acquiring
H pylori infection. These influences may
be a source of genetic influences for de-
veloping peptic ulcer disease. Similarly, it
is feasible that environmental risk factors
that are of importance for acquiring H py-

lori infection may also be of importance for developing
peptic ulcer disease.
The present study examined a large cohort of twins
to explore the relative importance of genetic influences
for individual differences in liability to peptic ulcer dis-
ease and H pylori infection. We studied a sample of mono-
zygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins, reared together
(MZT, DZT) or reared apart (MZA, DZA), who were par-
ticipants in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging
(SATSA).17 This sample allowed us to answer 2 major
research questions: (1) What is the relative importance
of genetic factors for liability to peptic ulcer disease?
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
SAMPLE
The sample for this investigation was composed of twins
from a subregistry of the Swedish Twin Registry, which in-
cludes entries for about 25 000 like-sexed twin pairs born
in Sweden between 1886 and 1958. The subregistry, known
as SATSA, consists of a number of twins who indicated that
they had been separated before the age of 11 years and reared
apart and a sample of twins reared together, matched on
the basis of sex, age, and county of birth. When SATSA was
initiated in 1984 with a mail-out questionnaire, both mem-
bers of 758 pairs responded to this questionnaire, of whom
691 pairs had completed the questionnaire regarding his-
tory of peptic ulcer. Two years later, a subset of reared-
together and reared-apart pairs older than 50 years in which
both members responded to the questionnaire were in-
vited to participate in an examination that included a health
evaluation. The average age at the time of testing was 65.6
years (SD, 8.4 years).
The genetic analyses of peptic ulcer disease were based
on 758 pairs for whom questionnaire responses were avail-
able on peptic ulcer history. Of these pairs, 270 had serum
samples available for evaluating H pylori status. Zygosity
was first determined on the basis of physical similarities
and confirmed on the basis of serological assay. One pair
was excluded from the analyses because adequate cer-
tainty of zygosity (98%) could not be obtained. The dis-
tribution of age at separation is highly skewed: 52% of the
twins reared apart were separated before their first birth-
day, 69% by their second birthday, 82% by the age of 5 years,
and all by the age of 11 years.17 Reasons for separation var-
ied; the majority were separated because of the death of 1
or both parents and/or economic hardship. Further de-
tails of the procedures, sample, and design of SATSA are
described by Pedersen et al.17
EVALUATION OF H PYLORI STATUS
The presence of anti­H pylori IgG was assessed by means
of a commercially available H pylori immunoassay test kit
(HM-CAP; Enteric Products Inc, Stony Brook, NY). The test
was scored positive when the optical density was greater
than 2.0. The test has a sensitivity of more than 98% and a
specificity of more than 95%.18 Helicobacter pylori in-
fection is chronic and even lifelong. After successful anti-
microbial therapy, the antibody titer becomes undetect-
able; however, the presence of serum antibody is a reliable
indication of H pylori status.
ANALYSES
The primary aim of the analyses is to describe individual
differences in liability to peptic ulcer by portioning these
differences (total variance) into genetic and environmen-
tal variance components. Quantitative genetic theory pos-
its that total phenotypic variance is the sum of genetic vari-
ance, environmental variance, and twice the covariation of
genetic and environmental effects. Genetic variance can be
further partitioned into additive genetic variance, reflect-
ing the effects of many segregating genes of equal effect,
and nonadditive genetic variance caused by interactions
within and among genetic loci. Environmental variance can
be partitioned into environmental effects shared by family
members (causing familial similarity) and nonshared en-
vironmental effects (causing differences among family mem-
bers). An assumption of the present analyses, that there is
no genotype-environment covariance, has been sup-
ported for most behavioral and biomedical phenotypes.19
Heritability is defined as the proportion of total variance
attributable to genetic variance. In these models, all vari-
ance that is not genetic is considered environmental. Thus,
the heritability statistic provides an estimate of the re-
lative importance of genetic differences for individual
differences in susceptibility to peptic ulcer in the popula-
tion (relative to environmental effects). This statistic re-
fers to the population and does not describe risk to an
individual.
INTRACLASS CORRELATIONS
Intraclass correlations were calculated to measure the simi-
larities within the twin pairs before the phenotypic vari-
ance was decomposed into genetic and environmental com-
ponents. The intraclass correlations and their interpretation
are as follows: (1) magnitude of MZA correlation: impor-
tance of genetic effects; (2) MZ correlations greater than
DZ correlations: importance of genetic effects; (3) twins
reared together more similar than twins reared apart: im-
portance of shared rearing environments; (4) no or little
difference of MZ and DZ correlations: importance of fa-
milial environmental effects; and (5) differences within MZ
pairs (1 - MZ correlation): nonshared environmental in-
fluences. The intraclass correlation of MZA twins pro-
vides a direct and unbiased estimate of heritability. Be-
cause the phenotype, presence of peptic ulcer disease, is
categorical (0 or 1), tetrachoric intraclass correlations were
calculated by the PRELIS2 program (Scientific Software Inc,
Chicago, Ill) for each of the 4 rearing-by-zygosity groups.
Examination of intraclass correlations provides valu-
able insights regarding the relative importance of genetic
and environmental factors. However, it is difficult to esti-
mate the importance of several variables, eg, heritability,
nonshared environment, shared rearing environment, and
other forms of correlated environment, by separate com-
parisons of pairs of correlations. Hence, structural models
based on quantitative genetic expectations of factors con-
tributing to twin similarities and differences were fit to the
data. The model used in the present study has been de-
scribed in detail by Neale and Cardon.20

(2) Are there genetic influences for peptic ulcer dis-
ease in common with genetic influences for H pylori
infection?
RESULTS
The intraclass correlations for peptic ulcer disease for the
4 rearing-by-zygosity groups, MZA, MZT, DZA, and DZT,
are presented in Table 1. Correlations for MZ and DZ
twins are also pooled over rearing groups to maintain rea-
sonable sample sizes. This pattern of correlations indi-
cates that genetic effects are of modest importance for
liability to peptic ulcer disease. Consistent with the in-
traclass correlations, the MZ probandwise concordance
rate (39%), pooled over rearing status, was significantly
greater than that for dizygotic pairs (15%) (P.001)
(Table 1). Furthermore, because twins reared together
were not more similar than twins reared apart, there is
no indication of shared rearing environments as a source
of familial similarity for peptic ulcer. There were no sig-
nificant sex differences in the intraclass correlations
(Table 2), even though the prevalence rate was higher
among men than women (7.5% and 5.3%, respectively).
The correlation coefficient for MZA twins (0.67) pro-
vides the best single estimate of the relative importance
of genetic effects (heritability) for liability to peptic ul-
cer disease. By definition, the remaining variance (ap-
proximately 35%) is nongenetic and indicates the role
of environmental factors for developing peptic ulcer dis-
ease. Structural model fitting analyses confirmed this find-
ing. Heritability was estimated at 62%, and the remain-
ing variance (38%) represented individual-specific,
nonshared environmental variance (2
5
= 0.63; P = .99;
Akaike Information Criterion, -9.37).
The association between H pylori and peptic ulcer
was established in a case-control analysis and by tetra-
choric correlation. A total of 299 unrelated individuals
randomly selected from each twin pair had values for H
pylori and peptic ulcer. The relative risk of those with H
pylori and peptic ulcer was almost 2-fold that of those
who did not have H pylori infection (relative risk, 1.9;
95% confidence interval, 0.80-4.39; 2 = 2.099; P = .14).
The tetrachoric correlation between H pylori and peptic
ulcer was 0.27 (P.05).
The second question addressed by the analyses was
the extent to which there is genetic variance for peptic
ulcer independent of genetic effects on H pylori infec-
tion. Possible genetic mediation of the association was
evaluated by examining cross-twin cross-trait correla-
tions, ie, ulcer in twin 1 with H pylori in twin 2. These
cross-correlations can be interpreted in a fashion analo-
gous to the intraclass correlations.19 If MZ cross-
correlations are greater than DZ cross-correlations, the
importance of genetic influences for the association be-
tween 2 traits is indicated. The correlations reported in
Table 3 indicate that there is no genetic variation in com-
mon between the 2 measures (peptic ulcer and H py-
lori), because average MZ cross-twin correlations, 0.25,
are not greater than average DZ cross-correlations, 0.29.
This pattern of correlations suggests that the associa-
tion between H pylori infection and peptic ulcer can be
ascribed to familial environmental influences in com-
mon to both measures. Structural model fitting con-
firmed this finding (results not shown).

COMMENT
The importance of genetic effects for H pylori­related dis-
eases such as peptic ulcer, gastritis, and gastric cancer is
currently of great interest. Although it is impossible to
separate entirely environmental factors from genetic in-
fluences, early twin and family studies suggested a ge-
netic component for these diseases.5-7 The present re-
sults showed that genetic effects are of moderate
importance for liability to peptic ulcer in our popula-
tion (heritability, 0.62), and the remaining variation can
be explained by individual-specific environments. De-
spite the greater prevalence of peptic ulcer in men than
women, there are no sex differences in twin similarity
for peptic ulcer.
Previously, we established the importance of ge-
netic factors for susceptibility to H pylori infection.16 The
heritability of liability to H pylori infection was 0.63. Heri-
tability is the proportion of total variance for liability to
disease caused by genetic variance that describes the ex-
tent to which differences in liability to disease in the popu-
lation are caused by genetic differences. To the best of
our knowledge, no published study has evaluated whether
genetic effects for developing peptic ulcer are indepen-
dent of or shared with genetic effects important for ac-
quiring H pylori infection. Comparisons of MZ and DZ
cross-twin, cross-trait correlations and structural model
fitting in the present study demonstrated that, despite the
similarity in heritabilities for the 2 traits, the genetic in-
fluences for liability to peptic ulcer disease are indepen-
dent of such genetic effects for acquiring H pylori infec-
tion. The relationship between H pylori and diseases such
as peptic ulcer, chronic gastritis, and gastric cancer ap-
pears to be mediated by familial environmental factors,
ie, environmental experiences or situations that are shared
by family members. Examples of familial environmen-
tal factors that may mediate the association between H
pylori and peptic ulcer disease are diet, smoking, and al-
cohol and coffee consumption.
Initially, the strongest evidence of a genetic influ-
ence on peptic ulcer came from studies showing an in-
creased risk of duodenal ulcer in individuals with hy-
perpepsinogenemia.21,22 Those results have been
questioned as it has become evident that elevated serum
pepsinogen I level is also a feature of H pylori infec-
tion.22-25 The present results indicate that the associa-
tion between peptic ulcer and H pylori reflects environ-
mental rather than genetic mediation. Thus, envir-
onmental influences leading to H pylori infection and el-
evated serum levels of pepsinogen may result in peptic
ulcer in susceptible individuals.
The occurrence of peptic ulcer disease has de-
clined remarkably in the United States and Europe dur-
ing the past 3 decades.26-28 Peptic ulcer was most preva-
lent among those born around the turn of the century
and has decreased in all subsequent generations.29,30 The
rapid change in the pattern of peptic ulcer in successive
generations (ie, birth cohorts) more likely results from
changes in environmental factors than changes in the
genes of the affected patients. Multiple risk factors iden-
tified for peptic ulcer include family history, age, sex, race,
social class, blood group, smoking, alcohol and coffee con-
sumption, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
stress, season of the year, and H pylori infection.8-13 None
of these factors can be considered universal of essential
characteristics of duodenal ulcer disease with the excep-
tion of H pylori­induced gastritis. Risk factors that are
not shared by family members, such as use of nonsteroi-
dal anti-inflammatory drugs, may represent examples of
the individual-specific source of variance in liability to
ulcer found in the present results.
Inspiteofthecomprehensivedesignofourstudy,there
may be some potential methodological problems. Al-
though the results are interesting and informative, our data
are based on self-reports, which could be subject to recall
bias, resulting in overreporting or underreporting of the
disease. However, the total prevalence rates of peptic ul-
cer disease among the Swedish population are 7.5% in men
and 5.3% in women, which are comparable with those of
other Scandinavian countries. On the basis of endoscopic
findings, one Norwegian study reported an overall preva-
lence of 7.4% in men and 4.6% in women.31 Similar fre-
quency estimates for lifetime prevalence of verified ulcers
were found in an unselected Danish population initially
identified with self-reported ulcer (7.7% among men and
3.6%amongwomen32).Anotherlargecross-sectionalques-
tionnaire-based survey conducted in northern Norway re-
ported a 5.3% prevalence of peptic ulcer in men and 2.1%
inwomen.33 Thus,theprevalenceofulcerfoundinthisstudy
is comparable with that reported in the region. Further-
more, the pairwise concordance rates (0.24 and 0.08 for
MZ and DZ pairs, respectively, not reported in Table 1) are
comparable with those based on the Danish Twin Regis-
try (0.26 and 0.14, respectively).6
In summary, genetic influences are of moderate im-
portance for peptic ulcer disease. Genetic factors of im-
portance to peptic ulcer are independent of such factors
for H pylori infection.
