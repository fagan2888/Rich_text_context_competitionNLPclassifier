THERE are large and consistent racial differences in
morbidity, mortality, and even markers for underlying
biological disease processes, such as systemic inflammation
(Cummings & Jackson, 2008; Geronimus, Hicken, Keened,
& Bound, 2006; Hayward, Miles, Crimmins, &Yang, 2000;
McDade, Lindau, & Wroblewski, 2010; Sloan, Ayyagari,
Salm, & Grossman, 2010). The consistency of these differ-
ences have lead some to call race, in addition to class and
gender, a fundamental cause of disease (Link & Phelan,
1995; Phelan & Link, 2010). Specifically in relation to race,
the argument is not that race biologically determines differ-
ences, but rather that race embodies access to resources,
such as income and power, which in turn shape health. In
the United States, lacking a high school degree or living
below the poverty line is associated with up to 12 fewer
years of life and up to 16 fewer years of life without disease
(Crimmins & Saito, 2001; Rogot, Sorlie, & Johnson, 1992).
In this context, race is a social construct (D. R. Williams,
Mohammed, Leavell, & Collins, 2010; D. R. Williams &
Sternthal, 2010). Differential access to resources, such as
income and education, plays a large role in explaining racial
differences in health (D. R. Williams et al., 2010). In addition
to class, gender patterns racial differences in health. Racial dif-
ferences, particularly the role of class and behavioral risk fac-
tors as mediators, vary between men and women (Cummings
& Jackson, 2008; Liu & Hummer, 2008; Read & Gorman,
2006; Winkleby, Kraemer, Ahn, & Varady, 1998). For
example, race differences are larger among women as com-
pared to men for outcomes like cardiovascular mortality and
associated behavioral risk factors like obesity (Gallant &
Dorn, 2001).
But, although the links between race and morbidity and
mortality are well elucidated, more recent evidence linking
race to biological disease processes is less well developed,
despite the potential utility of examining biological pro-
cesses that underlie the development of diseases patterned
by race. Systemic inflammation is a logical place to start
given its links to numerous diseases (i.e., diabetes, cardiac
problems) commonly patterned by race and because although
it is clear that race and inflammation, specifically C-reactive
protein (CRP), are highly correlated, the pathways linking
race to CRP are not well elucidated. CRP is an acute phase
protein that is considered a marker for systemic inflamma-
tion. In hundreds of studies, it has been prospectively asso-
ciated with disease outcomes ranging from cardiac disease
to diabetes and strokes (for reviews see Dehghan et al.,
2007; Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration, 2010; Hiekkila
et al., 2009).Although there is a dispute regarding the causal
processes linking CRP to disease, elevated CRP levels are
seen as a risk factor for disease (Lawlor et al., 2008).
Studies have demonstrated that race strongly patterns CRP
(Gruenwald, Cohen, Matthews, Tracy, & Seeman, 2009;

Objective. Understand the links between race and C-reactive protein (CRP), with special attention to gender differences
and the role of class and behavioral risk factors as mediators.
Method. This study utilizes the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project data, a nationally representative study
of older Americans aged 57­85 to explore two research questions. First, what is the relative strength of socioeconomic
versus behavioral risk factors in explaining race differences in CRP levels? Second, what role does gender play in under-
standing race differences? Does the relative role of socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors in explaining race differ-
ences vary when examining men and women separately?
Results. When examining men and women separately, socioeconomic and behavioral risk factor mediators vary in
their importance. Indeed, racial differences in CRP among men aged 57­74 are little changed after adjusting for both
socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors with levels 35% higher for black men as compared to white men. For women
aged 57­74, however, behavioral risk factors explain 30% of the relationship between race and CRP.
Discussion. The limited explanatory power of socioeconomic position and, particularly, behavioral risk factors,
in elucidating the relationship between race and CRP among men, signals the need for research to examine addi-
tional mediators, including more direct measures of stress and discrimination.

McDade et al., 2010). Though similar to racial differences
in morbidity and mortality, there is evidence that racial dif-
ferences in CRP may shrink in old age. Explanations for this
crossover include mortality selection, only the "hardiest"
African Americans survive to the oldest ages, and data
quality problems, particularly age misreporting by African
Americans (Preston & Elo, 2006).
CRP, as a marker for systemic inflammation, is an important
outcome when considering racial differences, especially in
the context of the fundamental cause framework. Inflamma-
tion is linked to multiple disease outcomes and the link
between race and health is not disease specific; the patterns
exist across a range of morbidity and mortality outcomes,
many of which (i.e., heart disease, strokes, diabetes) are
linked to CRP (Gorelick, 1998; Laiyemo et al., 2010;
McDade et al., 2010; D. R. Williams et al., 2010). Further,
many diseases linked to CRP levels, like cardiovascular
disease and diabetes, are racially patterned (Hayward et al.,
2000; Wyatt et al., 2005). Thus, the links between CRP and
a range of diseases and mortality risks makes CRP relevant
for investigations of its links to race.
Class and Behaviors
To date, however, the existing research has not fully elu-
cidated how class and behavioral risk factors mediate the
relationship between race and CRP. Though studies have
explored whether socioeconomic position (SEP) and behav-
ioral risk factors mediate the relationship between race and
CRP, the power of behavioral risk factors, independent of
class, is not clear. As already noted, race is a crucial determi-
nant of class--discrimination, both current and institutional,
has shaped education and income differences between
blacks and whites (Wilson, 2009). In turn, there is a large
body of work demonstrating that class--especially educa-
tion--is a determinant of behaviors (Herd, 2010; Mirowsky
& Ross, 2003). Thus, if one simply adjusts for behaviors,
without having adjusted for SEP, it is not clear whether the
explanatory power of behaviors to explain race differences
in CRP simply reflects the explanatory power of class, espe-
cially educational attainment. Many studies focused on how
behavioral risk factors mediate the relationship between race
and CRP, however, have not adjusted for SEP as a mediator
(Albert, Glynn, Buring, & Ridker, 2004).
Further, the few studies that have included both SEP and
behavioral risk factors, to account for race differences, have
generally not adjusted for behavioral risk factors separate
from other factors (McDade et al., 2010) or are based on
small unrepresentative samples (McDade, Hawkley, &
Cacioppo, 2006). For example, McDade and colleagues
(2010) add behavioral risk factors to the model simulta-
neously with measures of chronic disease burden, sleep
quality, marital status, depressive symptoms, and house-
hold cleanliness. Consequently, it is impossible to estab-
lish the extent to which behavioral risk factors, specifically,
mediate racial differences in CRP. A study conducted by
Kelley-Hedgepeth and colleagues (2008) did find that obesity
explained a larger fraction of the race difference in CRP than
did SEP, but the sample includes only women ages 42­52
with intact uteruses and ovaries. In sum, prior studies do not
make clear the extent to which behaviors explain relation-
ships between race and CRP, after adjusting for SEP.
Gender
But, although attention has been paid to SEP and behav-
ioral risk factors as mediators in the relationship between
race and CRP, the literature on racial differences in CRP has
paid almost no attention to gender. There is especially
limited evidence regarding how the roles of socioeconomic
and behavioral risk factors differ when examining men and
women separately. Studies that consider gender generally
are not based on nationally representative samples and are
not explicitly focused on explaining racial differences in CRP
(Gruenwald et al., 2009; Khera et al., 2005). Prior research
on health and health behaviors, however, would indicate
that there may be important gender differences in how racial
differences in CRP manifest themselves. For example, some
health differences appear to be particularly acute for African-
American women including cardiovascular mortality and
associated behavioral risk factors like obesity (Cummings
& Jackson, 2008; Liu & Hummer, 2008; Read & Gorman,
2006; Winkleby et al., 1998). Generally, racial differences in
behavioral risk factors like physical inactivity and obesity,
which are tightly linked to CRP and inflammation more
broadly, are larger among women than among men (Gallant &
Dorn, 2001; Winkleby et al., 1998). Finally, there is evidence
that class differences (as measured by income, education,
and occupation) in health also vary across gender (Mathews,
Manor, & Power, 1999; McDonough, Williams, House, &
Duncan, 1999).
Consequently, using the National Social Life, Health, and
Aging Project (NSHAP) data, a study of older Americans
aged 57­85, we elucidate the relationship between race and
CRP by focusing on two questions. First, what is the rela-
tive role of socioeconomic versus behavioral risk factors in
explaining racial differences in CRP levels? Second, what
role does gender play in understanding racial differences?
Does the role of socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors
differ when examining men and women separately?
Methods
Data
Collected in 2005­2006, the NSHAP is a nationally repre-
sentative study of noninstitutionalized older adults aged 57­85.
The NSHAP data contains information on the demographic
characteristics; romantic, sexual, and social relationships;
and physical and mental health--including biomarkers--of
3,005 American men and women aged 57­85. The final
response rate was 74.8% (O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman, &
SOCIAL PATTERNS OF A BIOLOGICAL RISK FACTOR FOR DISEASE 505
SOCIAL PATTERNS OF A BIOLOGICAL RISK FACTOR FOR DISEASE 3
Smith 2009). Data was collected via in-home interviews
and a mail-back questionnaire.
The NSHAP sample was chosen from a multistage area
probability design selected by the Institute for Social Research
for the Health and Retirement Study (O'Muircheartaigh
et al., 2009). NSHAP oversampled blacks and Latinos and
balanced age and gender subgroups (O'Muircheartaigh et al.,
2009). Although the full NSHAP includes 3,005 respon-
dents, a random 70% sample was asked to provide blood
spots of which 1,939 (85% response rate) provided usable
samples. Williams and McDade (2009) reported that respon-
dents who refused to provide blood spots did not differ from
those who agreed by gender, race, ethnicity, age, education,
income, marital status, self-rated physical or mental health,
or number of doctor visits in the past year.
As is standard in this literature, we excluded another 136
cases that had high CRP levels, which may be indicative of
acute illness (Pearson et al., 2003). NSHAP collected CRP
levels from dried blood spots. Different cutoff criteria for
maximum CRP levels have been established for plasma versus
blood spot samples (McDade, Burhop, & Dohnal, 2004).
A plasma level of 10 mg/L roughly corresponds to a blood
spot level of 8.6 mg/L, so CRP levels greater than 8.6 mg/L
are excluded from the analytic sample (see McDade et al.,
2010). Regardless, sensitivity tests demonstrated no mean-
ingful differences in the pattern of findings when including
even the highest CRP values.
We dealt with missing values on covariates by employing
multiple imputations (Stata 11), for 516 cases, 359 of which
were missing data on income (Rubin, 2004). We did not
impute data for an additional 46 cases missing data on
race. We imputed 10 values for each missing observation
(i.e., income), averaged those coefficients and importantly
calculated new standard errors (SEs) that account for the
variation across multiple potential imputed values. This is a
better strategy for missing data issues than stepwise deletion
because it reduces concerns about selection that could bias
the findings (Rubin, 2004). Further, multiple imputation also
adjusts SEs to reflect the error associated with imputation.
We ended with a total sample of 1,757. Because of the
randomized modular design of the survey, survey weights
used (which include nonresponse by age and urbanicity) are
likely adequate to account for additional selection.
Measures
Outcome.--CRP was obtained in NSHAP via blood spot
samples, which were collected on filter paper (Williams &
McDade, 2009). This method of CRP data collection has
been shown to be precise and reliable (McDade et al., 2004).
Because CRP levels were highly skewed, values were (natural)
log transformed.
Covariates.--Demographics: Race is based on self-reported
data. We classified respondents as Black non-Hispanic,
White non-Hispanic, and Hispanic. We employed an age
centered (at age 68) term. Sex is male or female.
SEP.--We employed two measures of SEP. The first
measure is educational attainment, which includes five cat-
egories: no high school degree, high school degree, some
college, college, and graduate degree. Income includes pre-
tax household income from wages, pensions, social security,
and government assistance. Some studies have shown that
low-income groups, but not moderate-income groups, had
significantly higher levels of inflammatory markers com-
pared to high-income groups (Friedman & Herd, 2010).
To allow for such nonlinear associations, we stratified
the sample into income quintiles. The income ranges that
corresponded to each quintile were: Q1: $17,838 or less;
Q2: $17,839­$35,037; Q3: $35,038­$50,161; Q4: $50,162­
76,809; Q5: $76,810 or more. Each quintile was dummy
coded and included in statistical analyses with the bottom
quintile serving as the referent. We did test a linear version
of the income measure, but found the results did not vary.
Physical health.--Health measures are included to help
reduce the risk for reverse causality in the SEP­CRP rela-
tionship. Significant health problems affect SEP (i.e., disease
onset inhibits both educational attainment and labor market
participation). Adjusting for existing/known health prob-
lems reduces the risk for reverse causality. In short, after
adjusting for health, higher CRP levels are more plausibly
a risk factor for disease, though we cannot rule out the pos-
sibility that there are some underlying unobserved health
differences.
Physical health status was assessed using self-reported
measures. We classified participants as having a particular
condition if a doctor had ever told them that they had the
following conditions: hypertension, diabetes or high blood
sugar, chronic pulmonary disease/emphysema, heart attack,
heart failure, operation to unclog or bypass arteries, asthma,
stroke, or arthritis. These measures, which have been linked
to inflammation, are included as individual dummy vari-
ables for each reported condition. Further, we adjust for
general self-assessed health. Respondents answered the fol-
lowing question "How would you rate your physical health:
excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?" Self-reported
general health appears to capture much of the health-related
variation in CRP.
Prescription drugs.--Many drugs, both prescription and
over-the-counter, including antihypertensive, cholesterol
lowering, and antidepressant, have been shown to have
anti-inflammatory properties (Jaim & Ridker, 2005; Kenis &
Maes, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2002; Ridker, Hennekens, Rifai,
Buring, & Manson, 1999). Further, steroid medications, par-
ticularly as part of a hormone replacement regimen, have
been shown to increase CRP levels. Dummy-coded variables
indicating current use of these medications were included in
506 HERD ET AL.

all analyses. Specifically, we included measures for choles-
terol absorption inhibitor medication, combination antihy-
perlipidemic medication, estrogens, progestin, nonsteroidal
antiinflammatories, steroids, and antidepressants. These
drugs were categorized using the Multum Drug Database:
Lexicon Plus version (Qato et al., 2008).
Behavioral risk factors.--We include body mass index
(BMI). We also included smoking measures, which capture
whether the respondent is a current smoker, former smoker,
or never smoked. Finally, we include measures of physical
activity. These include little exercise (<4 times/month)
moderate (1­2 times/week), and heavy (3 times/week).
Analytic Techniques
The relationship between CRP and SEP, race/ethnicity,
and gender was examined using ordinary least-squares
regression, which included weights and statistical adjust-
ments for the NSHAP sample frame (O'Muircheartaigh
et al., 2009). We based our determination of whether and
to what extent covariates mediated the relationship be-
tween race and CRP employing standards set by Baron
and Kenny (1986) mediation test. Step 1 requires that the
independent variable (in this case race) significantly affects
the mediator. Step 2 requires that the independent vari-
able significantly affects the dependent variable in the
absence of the mediator. Step 3 requires that the mediator
have an independent relationship with the dependent var-
iable. Step 4 requires that the mediator reduce the inde-
pendent variable to zero for full mediation. We consider
both the statistical significance and the change in the size of
the race coefficient. We are explicit in the results regarding
the exact percent size reduction.
The first set of analyses is conducted on the full sample to
address two research questions. First, are there racial differ-
ences in CRP adjusting for self-reported health measures?
Thus, Model 1 includes gender, race/ethnicity, age centered
at age 68, self-rated general physical health, medications,
and chronic conditions (see Table 1 for detailed health
measures). Model 2 adds an age and race interaction term to
test whether racial differences in CRP vary across age groups.
Second, what explains racial differences in CRP levels?
Model 3 tests for the role of SEP by including income
and education. Model 4 tests for the role of behavioral risk
factors by including BMI, smoking behavior, and exercise
frequency.
The second set of analyses breaks the sample down by
age (ages 57­74 and 75­85) and gender. Both prior research
on CRP (McDade et al., 2010; Mitka, 2003) and our own
sensitivity analyses testing interaction terms, indicate that
subanalyses by age are appropriate.As we already discussed,
findings of racial convergence in morbidity and mortality at
older ages is nearly universal, likely due to survivor selec-
tion (Johnson, 2000). Further, separate analyses for men
and women are important given prior research, discussed in
the Introduction, that indicates important gender differences
in how racial differences in CRP may manifest themselves
via SEP and behavioral risk factors. Model 1 includes race,
age, self-rated general physical health, medications, and
chronic conditions to establish baseline racial differences for
women as compared to men. Model 2 adds SEP variables
(education and income) to establish the extent to which SEP
mediates the relationship between race and CRP separately
for men versus women. Model 3 adds BMI, smoking
behavior, and exercise frequency to test the extent to which
behavioral risk factors mediate the relationship between
race and CRP separately for men versus women.
Results
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics on the dependent
variable and covariates, in addition to differences in the
covariates by race. As expected there are significant racial
differences in CRP levels, socioeconomic covariates, behav-
ioral risk covariates, and health covariates. Blacks have higher
CRP levels, lower SEP levels, and more behavioral risk
factors as compared to Whites.
CRP levels remain significantly higher amongst blacks
as compared to whites, after adjusting for sex, age, health
covariates, and prescription drug use, in this sample of those
aged 57­85 (Table 2, Model 1). Black respondents had CRP
levels 33% points higher than comparable whites. But that
variation is age graded (Table 2, Model 2). At older ages
(sensitivity analyses indicate above age 75­80), those dif-
ferences become insignificant, both statistically and in
terms of coefficient size (results shown in greater detail in
Table 3). In short, there is racial crossover in CRP levels
among the oldest sample respondents. This finding is robust
given that NSHAP oversampled blacks over age 80. Although
the main effects for Hispanics were not significant, there
was an interaction between ethnicity and age. At older ages,
the differences between whites and Hispanic CRP levels
widen. Because this is a cross section and because who
comprises Hispanics (nation of origin/immigration status/
SES) has changed over time, it is difficult to make a mean-
ingful interpretation of the positive interaction between age
and Hispanic ethnicity.
Does SEP explain racial differences? In model 3, after
including SEP covariates, the size of the race effect drops
from .32 to .26, a 15% reduction or a moderate change.
Compared to those without a high school degree, those
with high school degrees, college degrees, and professional
degrees had CRP levels 17, 22, and 38% points lower,
respectively, though the difference between those with
college degrees and high school degrees was marginally sta-
tistically significant (p < .10). Finally, the gender coefficient
shrinks from .19 to .16, with women having higher levels com-
pared to men indicating that SEP differences between men
and women play some role in explaining gender differences.

The inclusion of behavioral risk factors further elucidates
racial variation in CRP (Table 2, Model 4). The inclusion of
BMI, physical activity, and smoking patterns moderately
reduces the race coefficient from .26 to .22, a 15% reduction.
Though both SEP and behavioral risk factors moderately
weaken the relationship between race and CRP, the differ-
ences remain statistically significant.
Table 3 tackles our second research question. What role
does gender play in understanding racial differences? Does
the role of socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors differ
when examining men and women separately? Given both
prior evidence and evidence in Table 2 of weakening racial
differences in CRP at older ages, we further broke the
analyses down by age (those over and under age 75).
Table 3 demonstrates that racial differences shrink signif-
icantly after age 75. Basic racial differences in CRP are just
slightly larger for men than for women under age 75 (Model
1a and Model 1b), whereas the racial differences are not
significant for either women or men age 75­85 (Model 1c
and Model 1d).
Separate analyses for men and women in Models 2a­2d
indicate that SEP explains 16%­18% of the racial variation
in CRP for both men and women. Among women, the race
difference dropped by about 16%, once adjusting for SEP.
Among women under age 75, those with high school de-
grees (-.30, p < .05) and those with college degrees (-.35,
p < .10) had lower CRP levels than those without high
school degrees (Model 2a). Among women over age 75, the
only statistically significant difference was those with pro-
fessional degrees compared to those without high school
degrees (-.84, p < .05; Model 2c). It should be noted, how-
ever, that even though NSHAP oversampled individuals
aged 75 and older there are some groups, such as women with
professional degrees that are quite small. Among men under
age 75, the race coefficient shrinks by 18% (Model 2b). For
men younger than age 75, when compared to those without

a high school degree, those with a high school degree (-.29,
p < .05), those with an associate's degree (-.31, p < .05),
and those with a professional degree (-.46, p < .05) all had
lower levels of CRP. Among men over age 75, the only coef-
ficient that was significant was the difference between those
in the 4th income quintile compared to the bottom income
quintile (-.69, p < .05).
Models 3a­3d demonstrate that behavioral risk factors
explain a moderate amount of the racial variation among
women under age 75, but not for men under age 75. For
women under age 75, behaviors (BMI, smoking, and exer-
cise) explain 33% of the racial variation in CRP (Model 3a),
though race remains marginally significant with CRP levels
among black women 21% higher than among white women.
Contrastingly, among men under age 75, although behav-
ioral risk factors are both significant predictors of CRP levels
and help explain educational variation in CRP levels, they do
not help explain the racial differences (Model 3b). Indeed,
the race coefficient increases in both size and significance
once behaviors (BMI, exercise, and smoking) are included
in the models with black men aged 57­75 having CRP
levels 36% higher than white men. This coefficient is little
different than Model 1, where SEP and behavioral risk
factors are not included. Among women and men aged
75­85 (Models 3c and 3d), racial differences in CRP are not
significant, though BMI is independently associated with
CRP.
Discussion
This study emphasizes the importance of gender, class, and
behavioral risk factors, in addition to age, in understanding
racial differences in CRP levels. In the full sample, SEP and
behavioral risk factors explain relatively equivalent amounts
of the relationship between race and CRP. Racial differ-
ences are not fully explained by socioeconomic and behav-
ioral risk factor mediators. Examining women and men
separately produced some interesting findings, however.
First, behavioral risk factors explained nearly 30% of the
relationship between race and CRP for women aged 57­74,
as compared to SEP, which explained 13% of the relation-
ship. However for men, although SEP did account for a
fraction of the relationship, behavioral risk factors actually
suppressed racial differences in CRP among men aged 57­74.
Thus after adjusting for both SEP and behavioral risk fac-
tors, race differences in CRP were little different than
models accounting for neither factor.
Similar to prior studies, we find diminishing racial differ-
ences in CRP at the oldest ages. It is unlikely that this dimin-
ishment is a cohort effect resulting from cross-sectional
data. Indeed, racial differences should be larger in older
cohorts given general improvements in economic well being
and declining discrimination for younger cohorts. Healthy
survivor selection likely plays a role in these declining differ-
ences at the oldest ages (Preston & Elo, 2006).
We also find that SEP, particularly education, and behav-
ioral risk factors help explain racial differences in CRP
levels. In the full sample, SEP and behavioral risk factors
each explain approximately 15%­20% of the relationship
between race and CRP, though the relationship remains
statistically significant even after adjusting for both. The
inclusion of behavioral risk factors also mediated SEP differ-
ences in CRP, which parallels findings in the existing litera-
ture (Alley et al., 2006; Friedman & Herd, 2010; Kershaw,
Mezuk, Abdou, Rafferty, & Jackson , 2010; Lubbock, Goh,
Ali, Ritchie, & Whooley, 2005). And similar to our findings,
existing research generally does not find that behaviors
fully explain relationship between SEP and inflammation
(Khera et al., 2005; Kivimaki et al., 2005), though Pollitt and
colleagues (2008) do find it explains much of the relation-
ship for CRP, though not for an alternative marker for
inflammation, fibrinogen.
Although behavioral risk factors play an important role in
explaining racial differences in CRP levels, racial differences
in behavioral risk factors may reflect coping mechanisms
to manage stress and distress (Kershaw et al., 2009; Kim,
Bursac, DiLillo, White, & West, 2009; Lewis, Aiello,
Leurgans, Kelly, Barnes, 2010; D. R. Williams et al., 2010).
For example, stress from discrimination may affect eating
patterns and substance abuse (Borrell et al., 2007). This dis-
tinction is important because it implies that these behaviors
may not be individualized and easily modifiable, but are a
reaction to the stress associated with deprivation and discrim-
ination (Geronimus et al., 2006; Phelen & Link, 2010).
When testing mediation effects separately for men and for
women, the models indicated that SEP explained relatively
similar amounts of the racial difference in CRP. Indeed,
research examining the relationship between SEP and CRP
has tended to find either no gender difference or a slightly
larger relationship for women as compared to men (Gruenwald
et al., 2009; Kivimaki et al., 2005; Rathmann et al., 2006).
It is worth noting, however, that these studies were based on
samples that were either younger than our sample (Gruenwald
et al., 2009; Kivimaki et al., 2005) or racially homogenous
(Rathmann et al., 2006).
Most striking was that among men aged 57­75, after
adjusting for both SEP and behavioral risk factors, racial
differences in CRP levels were almost unchanged. SEP did
explain 18% of the difference, but behavioral risk factors
were actually suppressing racial differences. So after adjusting
for both SEP and behavioral risk factors, racial differences
were nearly the same as when not adjusting for SEP and
behavioral risk factors. These findings parallel prior work
on young black men (Gruenwald et al., 2009).
Unlike for men, behavioral risk factors explained 33% of
the racial differences in CRP among women and their inclu-
sion reduced the race coefficient to marginal statistical
significance. The difference in BMI as a mediator for racial
differences for women as compared to men is likely rooted
in the fact that there are no meaningful racial differences in
SOCIAL PATTERNS OF A BIOLOGICAL RISK FACTOR FOR DISEASE 511
SOCIAL PATTERNS OF A BIOLOGICAL RISK FACTOR FOR DISEASE 9
BMI among men, but relatively large racial differences in BMI
among women. Indeed, Kelley-Hedgepeth and colleagues
(2008) find that BMI explains much of the racial differences
among women, though they did not analyze men. Further,
there is existing evidence that BMI is a more important
mediator between SEP and CRP for women than for men
(Gruenwald et al. 2009) and that BMI helps explain most of
the higher CRP levels in women compared to men (Cartier
et al. 2009). For example, Kershaw and colleagues (2010)
find the mediated effect of diet was stronger for women than
for men. Khera and colleagues (2009) find that body fat is a
more important predictor of CRP in women than in men.
What explains the remaining racial differences in CRP
levels, especially among men? One hypothesis that should be
pursued in future work is the potential effects of stress, par-
ticularly discrimination. Indeed, fundamental cause theory
would argue that race is a fundamental cause, separate from,
though related to SEP precisely because of racial discrimi-
nation. As noted earlier, the fact that behavioral differences
play a role in explaining racial differences, at least for
women, may reflect coping patterns to manage stress and
distress. There may be other ways that stress operates for
black men that are not measured in this study. There is
growing evidence that stress is linked to higher levels of
inflammation (Fuligni et al., 2009; Kiecolt-Glaser et al.,
2010; McDade et al., 2006; Taylor, Lehman, Kiefe, &
Seeman, 2006). For example, a recent meta-analysis of
laboratory studies concluded that acute psychological
stressors produce increases in circulating levels of in-
flammatory proteins, including CRP (Steptoe, Hamer, &
Chida, 2007).
Racial discrimination is thought to represent a particu-
larly noxious type of chronic stress that is linked to a
range of adverse health outcomes in blacks, and there is
recent evidence that chronic discrimination is associated
with higher levels of CRP in black adults (Lewis et al., 2010)
and in E-selectin in a sample of older adults (Friedman,
Williams, Singer, & Ryff, 2009). Further, discrimination
is linked to heart disease--coronary calcification and
behavioral risk factors (Borrell et al., 2007; Lewis et al.,
2010). Future research must consider chronic stress gen-
erally, and experiences of discrimination specifically, as
potential contributors to racial differences in systemic
inflammation.
Although this study does not fully explain what mediates
race difference in CRP, it does make clear that the path-
ways mediating racial differences in CRP may be dif-
ferent for men and women.And that for men, in particular,
behavioral risk factors do little to explain the racial pat-
terning of CRP.
