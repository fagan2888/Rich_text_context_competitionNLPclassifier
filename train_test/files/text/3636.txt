Abstract
Objective: To assess the influence of etanercept, an anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a agent,
on autonomic cardiovascular regulation in young patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis
without cardiovascular risk factors.
Methods: Patients with psoriasis underwent 5-min electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings before
and after 24 weeks of etanercept therapy. Linear heart rate variability (HRV) analysis was
performed.
Results: The study recruited 19 patients. Frequency-domain analysis showed a significant decrease
in oscillatory components attributable to sympathetic activity (LF%) and a significant decrease in
low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio following etanercept therapy.
Conclusion: Treatment with etanercept in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis could
affect cardiovascular autonomic regulation, and subsequently reduce cardiovascular risk.

Introduction
There is increasing awareness that psoriasis,
a chronic inflammatory skin disease, has
systemic manifestations.1,2 The relationship
between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and
severe psoriasis (Psoriasis Area Severity
Index3 [PASI] ! 10) is of increasing interest,4
as this may explain the increased mortality
related to acute myocardial infarction and
ventricular arrhythmias in patients with
psoriasis.5­8
Psoriasis and CVD may have common
pathogenic mechanisms.9,10 Heart rate vari-
ability (HRV) analysis evaluates autonomic
control of the sinus node11 and has been
used to investigate the cardiac sympatho­
vagal balance in patients with a subclinical
inflammatory state.12,13 There are no studies
regarding the use of HRV analysis to assess
the effects of biological drugs on the cardio-
vascular system, and the association
between these drugs and CVD remains
unclear.14,15 In particular, although cases
of worsening and new-onset heart failure
have been reported during etanercept ther-
apy,16,17 an increased risk of myocardial
infarction and/or heart failure has not yet
been demonstrated.18,19
The aim of the present open-label study
was to determine whether etanercept influ-
ences autonomic cardiovascular regulation,
therefore affecting CVD risk, in young
patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis,
in the absence of metabolic syndrome and
other cardiovascular comorbidities.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study enrolled consecutive patients with
psoriasis who attended the outpatient clinic
of the Dermatology Unit ``Daniele
Innocenzi'', University of Rome ``La
Sapienza'', Fiorini Hospital, Terracina,
Italy, between October 2013 and April
2014. Inclusion criteria were: aged 18­35
years; cutaneous moderate-to-severe plaque
psoriasis (PASI ! 10); absence of treatment
with long-term psychoactive drugs and
short-term modifiers of autonomic function;
absence of common cardiovascular risk fac-
tors; no previous treatment with traditional
or biological psoriasis drugs. All patients
provided written informed consent, and the
study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki.20 The requirement
for ethics committee approval was waived.Õ
Data collection
Data regarding clinical, cardiovascular and
dermatological history, sex, age and waist
circumference were collected from each
patient. Laboratory parameters including
blood lipids and glucose were recorded,
and body mass index and PASI calculated.
Heart rate, blood pressure and a 5-min
digital electrocardiogram were obtained from
all patients at baseline (1­7 days before initi-
ation of treatment) and at 24 weeks after
etanercept initiation. Etanercept was self-
administered at a dosage of 50 mg twice
weekly for the first 12 weeks (induction
period) and weekly thereafter.
HRV analyses
Data generated from the 5-min digital elec-
trocardiogram were analysed with
CardiolabÕ CE pocket PC ECG
software (Xai-Medica, Kharkov, Ukraine).
Linear methods including time-domain and
frequency-domain analyses were used for
direct estimation of HRV. For time-domain
analyses, statistical characteristics of
dynamic row of cardiointervals included
standard deviation of all normal-to-normal
[NN] intervals (SDNN) and root mean
square successive difference between adja-
cent NNs (RMSSD). Frequency-domain
analysis of HRV describes the periodic
oscillations of the heart rate signal at differ-
ent frequencies and amplitudes. The power
spectrum can be classified into two principal
44 Journal of International Medical Research 44(1S)
bands: low frequency (LF) and high fre-
quency (HF). The HF component is
generally defined as a marker of vagal
modulation. The LF component is modu-
lated by both the sympathetic and the
parasympathetic nervous systems. The LF/
HF ratio is considered as an index of
sympatho­vagal balance.21
Statistical analyses
Data were expressed as mean Æ SD or n (%).
Between-timepoint differences in quantita-
tive variables were analysed using paired
t-test. Statistical analyses were performed
using SigmaStatÕ version 3.5 (Systat
Software, Point Richmond, CA, USA) for
WindowsÕ. P-values < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
The study enrolled 19 patients (11 male/
eight females, mean age 28.5 Æ 4.9 years; age
range 18­32 years), all of whom completed
the 24-week treatment period. No side-
effects were recorded during the observation
period. Baseline demographic data and clin-
ical data at baseline and 24 weeks are given
in Table 1. Mean PASI was significantly
lower than baseline at 24 weeks (P < 0.001).
In particular, the entire study population
reached at least PASI 50 (!50% reduction
in initial PASI) at 24 weeks, and two male
patients reached PASI 75 (!75% reduction
in initial PASI). After the scheduled period
of therapy, all patients continued on 50 mg/
week etanercept according to international
guidelines. At the time of writing, no adverse
events were observed in the study
population.

Discussion
Observational studies have found an
increased risk of cardiovascular events in
patients with psoriasis.22­26 Explanations of
this phenomenon have focused on the
common inflammatory subset of these dis-
orders.27 Cardiovascular diseases are mainly
caused by atherosclerosis, which is a chronic
inflammatory disease of blood vessels,28 and
inflammatory markers are related to both
psoriasis severity and cardiovascular risk.22
Reductions in these parameters occur during
etanercept therapy.29,30 Despite evidence
indicating inflammation acts as a bridge
between psoriasis and CVD pathogenesis,
uncertainty remains as to its mechanism of
action. To the best of our knowledge, there
have been no studies considering the role of
the autonomic cardiac regulation in this
scenario.
We used HRV analyses to assess the
effects of biological drugs on the cardiovas-
cular system, and found that etanercept
modified autonomic cardiovascular regula-
tion, and consequently CVD risk, in our
patient population. Frequency-domain ana-
lysis showed a significant decrease in oscil-
latory components attributable to
sympathetic activity (LF%) and a significant
decrease in the LF/HF ratio, universally
considered an index of sympatho­vagal
balance.21
In conclusion, our preliminary data sug-
gest that etanercept therapy could modify
autonomic cardiovascular regulation in
patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.
It is possible that etanercept may influence
the cardiovascular risk associated with psor-
iasis. The close relationship between psoria-
sis and CVD emphasises the importance of
cardiovascular screening in patients with
psoriasis, especially in the presence of risk
factors.
