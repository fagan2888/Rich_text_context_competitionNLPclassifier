ABSTRACT
AMD (age-related macular degeneration) is a neurodegen-
erative disease causing irreversible central blindness in the
elderly. Apoptosis and inflammation play important roles
in AMD pathogenesis. PEDF (pigment epithelium-derived
factor) is a potent neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory
glycoprotein that protects the retinal neurons and pho-
toreceptors against cell death caused by pathological
insults. We studied the effects of PEDF on focal retinal
lesions in DKO rd8 (Ccl2- / - /Cx3cr1- / - on C57BL/6N
[Crb1rd8]) mice, a model for progressive, focal rd (retinal
degeneration). First, we found a significant decrease in PEDF
transcript expression in DKO rd8 mouse retina and RPE
(retinal pigment epithelium) than WT (wild-type, C57BL/6N).
Next, cultured DKO rd8 RPE cells secreted lower levels
of PEDF protein in the media than WT. Then the right
eyes of DKO rd8 mice were injected intravitreously with
recombinant human PEDF protein (1 g), followed by a
subconjunctival injection of PEDF (3 g) 4 weeks later.

PEDF was assessed by fundoscopy, ocular histopathology

inflammatory molecules. The PEDF-treated eyes showed
slower progression or attenuation of the focal retinal lesions,
fewer and/or smaller photoreceptor and RPE degeneration,
and significantly lower A2E, relative to the untreated eyes.
In addition, lower expression of apoptotic and inflamma-
tory molecules were detected in the PEDF-treated than
untreated eyes. Our results establish that PEDF potently
stabilizes photoreceptor degeneration via suppression of
both apoptotic and inflammatory pathways. The multiple
beneficial effects of PEDF represent a novel approach for
potential AMD treatment.

INTRODUCTION
AMD (age-related macular degeneration) is a chronic, pro-
gressive, neurodegenerative disorder in the retinal macula.
AMD has become the leading cause of irreversible cen-
tral vision loss in the elderly worldwide (Coleman et al.,
2008; Klein et al., 2011; Lim et al., 2012). There are two
major forms of AMD: geographic atrophic (dry) AMD and
exudative/neovascular (wet) AMD. Atrophic AMD is char-
acterized by drusen deposits, RPE (retinal pigment epithe-
lium)/photoreceptor degeneration and loss in the macula. In
neovascular AMD, CNV (choroidal neovascularization) breaks
through the Bruch's membrane to the neuroretina, causing
fluid leakage, lipid accumulation, and ultimately resulting in
fibrovascular scarring. Most AMD patients have large con-
fluent drusen in the macula and later develop geographic
atrophy or neovascular AMD, both of which cause severe
visual loss (Ambati and Fowler, 2012).
Although AMD is a neurodegenerative disorder (de Jong,
2006), causes of the macular degeneration are still not clear.
Several evidence has linked it to intense parainflammation
due to a wide range of causes, such as ageing, oxidative
stress, genetic predisposition, and environmental elements
(Xu et al., 2009; Rutar et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Am-
bati and Fowler, 2012; Colak et al., 2012; Kauppinen et al.,
2012; Tarallo et al., 2012). Under these conditions, the RPE,
photoreceptors and retinal neurons are exposed to the cy-
tokines and neurotoxins released by the activated inflam-
matory components, thereby contributing to the initiation
and progression of AMD. In addition, studies have shown
that apoptosis of RPE and photoreceptors are involved in
geographic atrophy AMD (Dunaief et al., 2002; Yang et al.,
2005).
PEDF (pigment epithelium-derived factor) is a naturally
occurring glycoprotein of 50-kDa that is present abundantly
in the retina and is secreted mainly by RPE in a directional
fashion toward the neuroretina (Becerra et al., 2004). It be-
longs to the serpin (serine protease inhibitor) superfamily
by sequence homology (Steele et al., 1993). Although PEDF
lacks protease inhibitory activity, it exhibits several biologi-
cal activities of interest for the eye that make it a potential
therapeutic agent for several ocular diseases. PEDF was dis-
covered in the culturing media of human fetal RPE cells with
potent neuronal differentiating activity on retinoblastoma
cells (Tombran-Tink et al., 1991). Later it was established that
PEDF is a neurotrophic factor of the retina and the CNS
(central nervous system). It protects photoreceptors against
apoptosis in the rd (retinal degeneration) and rds (retinal
degeneration slow) and light damage animal models, inner
retina against ischemia and retinal ganglion cells (Cayouette
et al., 1999; Cao et al., 2001; Takita et al., 2003; Pang et al.,
2007). PEDF has pro-survival and anti-apoptotic activity on
R28 cells, a rat retinal progenitor cells in culture (Murakami
et al., 2008; Fitzgerald et al., 2012). In a dose-dependent
manner, PEDF effectively protects R28 cell death induced by
serum starvation and elevates the levels of the anti-apoptotic
Bcl2 gene and protein. Furthermore, it not only supports neu-
ral survival and neurite outgrowth in the retina and CNS but
also has anti-inflammatory activity in MÂ¨
uller and endothelial
cells (Marciniak et al., 2006; Yabe et al., 2010; Miyazaki et al.,
2011; Park et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012). In 1999, Dawson
et al. reported that PEDF is one of the more potent antian-
giogenic factors, which has demonstrable inhibitory activ-
ity against ocular neovascularization in vivo (Dawson et al.,
1999).
Given the reported neurotrophic, retina-protective and
anti-inflammatory effects of PEDF in the retina, the aim of
this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective and anti-
inflammatory effects of PEDF on the retinal lesions in a
DKO rd8 (Ccl2- / - /Cx3cr1- / - on C57BL/6N [Crb1rd8]) mouse
model of progressive, focal rd, mimicking certain features of
human atrophic AMD (Chu et al., 2012).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
PEDF protein
Highly purified recombinant human PEDF was obtained from
the culture media of BHK (baby-hamster kidney) cells harbor-
ing an expression plasmid containing full-length PEDF cDNA
(Stratikos et al., 1996), by ammonium sulphate precipitation
and cation- and anion-exchange column chromatography as
described previously (Subramanian et al., 2012).
Animals and drug treatment
We generated the DKO rd8 mouse as a model of progressive,
focal rd (Tuo et al., 2007; Chan et al., 2008). In addition to the
Ccl2- / - /Cx3cr1- / - double knockout, the C57BL/6N mouse
line has the Crb1 (crumbs-like 1) mutation in homozygous
form (Mattapallil et al., 2012). The DKO rd8 mouse has earlier
onset and higher penetrance than Ccl2 and Cx3cr1 single
knockout strains (Chu et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2013). Al-
though it is not a perfect model for AMD (Chu et al., 2012;
Mattapallil et al., 2012), these mice develop certain features
resembling human AMD lesions (Chu et al., 2012). The DKO
rd8 mice and age-matched WT (C57BL/6N [Crb1rd8]) mice
were bred in-house. All animal experiments were performed
under protocols approved by the National Eye Institute's In-
stitutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were in com-
pliance with the Association for Research in Vision and Oph-
thalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic
and Vision Research. The right eyes of 6-week-old DKO rd8
mice were intravitreously injected with recombinant human
PEDF protein (1 g), followed by a second subconjunctival in-
jection of PEDF (3 g) 4 weeks later. Left eyes were untreated
and served as controls.

PEDF protects neuroretina in an AMD model
Isolation and culture of primary mouse RPE cells
Mouse RPE was isolated from retinas of WT and DKO rd8
mice of 6Â­8 weeks old. Briefly, experimental animals were
euthanized and their eyes were enucleated. The globes were
dissected free of periocular connective tissue, transferred
into 2% Dispase II (neutral protease, grade II, Roche) in PBS,
and incubated at 37C for 40Â­45 min. Dispase II activity was
terminated by washing the globes three times in DMEM/F12
(Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium: Ham's nutrient mixture
F-12) medium plus 15% (v/v) FBS. The anterior segment was
removed and the retina was dissected free from the underly-
ing RPE-choroidal eyecups. The loosely adherent RPE cell layer
was gently separated from the choroid and transferred to a
15-ml tube containing DMEM/F12, 15% (v/v) FBS and 1% L-
glutamineÂ­penicillinÂ­streptomycin. The RPE suspension was
planted on 24-well cell culture plates at 5% (v/v) CO2
/37C.
The medium was changed after 5Â­6 days, and every 2Â­3 days
thereafter. The RPE cells grew to form a confluent cell layer
by 10 days and then incubated in the serum-free culture
medium for 72 h. The culture medium was collected to mea-
sure PEDF protein level by ELISA/Western blot and the cells
in the wells were used for RNA/total protein isolation.
RNA isolation and qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated from primary mouse RPE cells and
retina using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). One g RNA was
reverse transcribed with Superscript II RNase H Reverse Tran-
scriptase (Invitrogen) to 20 l cDNA except for the deter-
mination of PEDF transcript. qRT-PCR was performed on the
resulting cDNA using Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix
(Stratagene). The comparative cycle threshold value method,
representing log transformation, was used to establish rel-
ative quantification of the fold changes in gene expression
using ABI 7500 System (Applied Biosystems). Each 25 l reac-
tion volume contained 2ÃPCR master mix (SYBR Green/Rox;
SABiosciences), 0.4 M of each primer and 1 l cDNA. The
cDNA was amplified with specific primers for 40 cycles.
-actin (sense primer 5 -TCCCCCAACTTGAGATGTATGAAG-3
and antisense primer 5 -AACTGGTCTCAAGTCAGTGTACAGG-
3 ) was used as a housekeeping gene for internal control.
Primers of -actin, Fasl (Fas ligand), Fas, Bax, Bcl2, TNF
(tumor necrosis factor-alpha), Il1 (interleukin-1beta), Il17a
(interleukin-17a), iNos (inducible nitric oxide synthase) and
Vegfa (vascular endothelial growth factor A) were purchased
from SABiosciences. For PEDF, 200Â­400 ng mRNA was used
for reverse transcription using SuperScript III First-Strand
Synthesis System (Invitrogen). PEDF mRNA levels were quan-
tified and normalized to 18S levels by quantitative RT-PCR
using SYBR Green mix (Applied Biosystems) in the Bio-
Rad Chromo4 real-time system. The thermal cycling con-
ditions were 95C for 15 min, then 46 cycles of 95C for
30 s, 60C for 30 s and 72C for 30 s. The primers used
were as follows: mouse PEDF 5 -ACCGTGACCCAGAACTTGAC-
3 (forward) and 5-CACGGGTTTGCCAGTAATCT-3 (reverse)
and 18S 5 -GGTTGATCCTGCCAGTAG-3 (forward) and 5 -
GCGACCAAAGGAACCATAAC-3 (reverse).
ELISA
PEDF protein levels in the culture medium were quantified by
ELISA using the mouse PEDF ELISA kit (BioProducts MD, LLC).
The media was treated with 8 M urea prior to ELISA as it re-
sulted in better quantitation of PEDF levels. The samples were
analyzed in duplicates following manufacturer's instruction.
Standard curves of recombinant mouse PEDF were used to
determine the sample concentration for each protein and
normalized against the total protein concentration for each
sample.
Western blot
Different amounts of recombinant PEDF were also loaded
along with the samples to estimate the amount of PEDF in
the media upon densitometry analysis. Proteins were sep-
arated by SDSÂ­PAGE using NuPAGE 10% PAGE in BisÂ­Tris
buffer with NuPAGE MOPSÂ­SDS as running buffer (Invit-
rogen) under reducing conditions. After separation by SDSÂ­
PAGE electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocel-
lulose membrane, blocked with blocking solution [1% (w/v)
BSA in TBS-T (0.05 M Tris, pH 7.5, 0.05 M NaCl + 0.1% (v/v)
Tween 20)] for 1 h at room temperature (20Â­22C), and in-
cubated with polyclonal antibody to PEDF (Bioproducts MD,
Inc.) in blocking solution at 1:10000 dilution and then washed
three times with TBS-T for 5 min each. This was followed by
incubations with secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (KPL) diluted 1:200000 in blocking solution).
For immunodetection, Super Signal West Dura Extended Du-
ration Substrate (Thermo Scientific) was used and then the
membrane was exposed to an X-ray film to visualize chemi-
luminescence signal.
Fundus photography and clinical grading
Fundoscopy was performed before injection and 2 months
post-injection. An endoscope with parallel illumination and
observation channels was connected to a Nikon D90 dig-
ital camera. Mice were given intraperitoneal injection of
ketamine (1.4 mg/mouse) and xylazine (0.12 mg/mouse) for
systemic anesthesia and topical 1% tropicamide ophthalmic
solution (Alcon Inc.) for pupil dilation. We assigned lesion
grades by comparing the same fundus area over the 2-month
course. Progression was defined as >10% increase in the
number of the retinal lesions ( + 1), >50% increase in the
lesion size in at least one-third of the lesions ( + 2), >5 fused
lesions or the appearance of >2 chorioretinal scars ( + 3)
and diffuse chorioretinal scars ( + 4). Regression was defined
as >10% decrease in the number of retinal lesions ( - 1),
>50% decrease in lesion size in at least one-third of the
lesions ( - 2), >50% disappearance of retinal lesions ( - 3)

trimethyl-1-cyclohexen-1-yl)
1E,3E,5E,7E-hexatrienyl]-pyridinium} extraction
and quantification
A2E is a lipofuscin fluorophore generated from the visual
cycle flux of all-trans-retinol and is relevant to ageing and
AMD pathogenesis (Ben-Shabat et al., 2001). Whole eyes were
removed in a dark room under dim red light and homoge-
nized. A2E was extracted with chloroform/methanol as previ-
ously described (Karan et al., 2005). The extracts dissolved in
methanol were separated by HPLC (Agilent 1100 LC) and de-
tected by an ultraviolet detector at a wavelength of 435 nm.
A gradient of 40Â­95% (v/v) acetonitrile/H2
O in 0.1 (v/v)% tri-
fluoracetic acid was used to elute A2E on a reverse-phase C18
column (Agilent, eclipse XD8-C18, 5 m, 4.6Ã150 mm) at a
flow-rate of 1.0 ml/min. A2E was quantified using external
A2E standards (Parish et al., 1998).
Histopathology
Eyes were fixed for 30 min in 4% (v/v) gluteraldehyde fol-
lowed by 10% (v/v) formalin for at least 24 h. Fixed eyes
were embedded in methacrylate and serially sectioned in the
vertical pupillary optic nerve plane. Each eye was cut into
four sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, then
analyzed under a light microscope.
Frozen sections, TUNEL (terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end
labeling) assay and immunohistochemistry
Eyes were harvested following euthanasia of mice, snap
frozen and embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT Compound (Sakura
Finetek USA Inc.). Serial sections were cut along the vertical
pupillary-optic nerve plane and stored on slides at - 70C.
Frozen mouse eye slides were fixed in 4% (v/v)
paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed in PBS. The fixed
slides were labeled using a TUNEL assay kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Roche). In addition, the fixed
slides were blocked in ICC buffer with 5% normal goat or
rabbit serum for 30 min at 4C. Samples were incubated
overnight with primary antibodies to the following antigens:
FasL, 1:50 (Abcam, Inc.); Fas, 1:200 (Santa Cruz); Bax, 1:200
(Santa Cruz); and Bcl-2, 1:200 (Santa Cruz). After washing
with ICC buffer, DAPI (4 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihy-
drochloride, 1:1000, Invitrogen) and secondary antibodies
conjugated to either Alexa-488 or -555 (1:400, Invitrogen)
were added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. All
the slides with TUNEL or immunohistochemical staining were
examined under an Olympus FV1000 Confocal Scanning Mi-
croscope. TUNEL positive cells in the ONL (outer nuclear layer)
were counted using the particles analyze plugin of the Image-
J software. The thickness of ONL was measured by Olympus
FV1000 software.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism
5 (GraphPad Software). Cell data were evaluated using the
unpaired t test. Mouse data of clinical fundus scores, qRT-PCR
and A2E were compared using paired t test. All the probability
levels in the paired and unpaired t test are two-tailed. A P
value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Decreased PEDF expression in RPE and
neuroretina of DKO rd8 mice
We compared the level of Pedf transcripts in freshly isolated
RPE and neuroretina from WT and DKO rd8 mice. Pedf was
expressed in the retina of both WT and DKO rd8. Quantitation
of expression level by real-time PCR revealed approximately
30% decrease in Pedf mRNA in DKO rd8 RPE and neuroretina
compared with WT (Figure 1A). Given that RPE is the main
source for the secreted PEDF in the interphotoreceptor
matrix (Becerra et al., 2004), primary mouse RPE cells were
cultured from WT and DKO rd8, and the concentration of
the secreted PEDF protein was measured in the serum-free
conditioned media collected from these cells. The concentra-
tion of PEDF in DKO was 3-fold less than in WT (Figure 1B).
The secreted PEDF protein in the conditioned media was
analyzed by Western blot. The protein band migrated as
expected for a 50 kDa size of PEDF protein and only one
band was detected (Figure 1C). The estimated concentration
of PEDF was 173 ng/ml for DKO and 650 ng/ml for WT,
corresponding to a 3.7-fold decrease in the DKO mouse RPE,
which is similar to that found by ELISA (Figure 1C). Overall,
our data show a marked decrease in both PEDF mRNA and
protein levels in DKO rd8 mice compared with WT.
PEDF attenuated focal retinal lesions of DKO rd8
mice
The decreased endogenous PEDF levels associated with the
defects in the DKO eyes suggest that administration of PEDF
could compensate such defects. To test whether PEDF would
positively affect the retinal lesions in the DKO mice, we lo-
cally administered purified human recombinant PEDF protein.
Fundoscopy revealed that PEDF-treated retina at 2 months
showed significant improvement over the contralateral,

PEDF protects neuroretina in an AMD model
Figure 1 PEDF levels in RPE and retina of DKO rd8 and WT
(A) Pedf transcripts in freshly isolated retina and RPE from WT and DKO rd8 mice by RT-PCR. Pedf transcripts are expressed relative to
the expression of 18S (PEDF/18S ratio) and normalized to WT mice as 100%. Data are the average of three independent experiments.
For RPE (n = 16 and 4) and for retina (n = 4 and 2) eyes were pooled in respective experiments. (B) PEDF protein concentration in
the conditioned media of primary mouse RPE in culture was measured by ELISA. Each value corresponds to the average of duplicates
per condition and with two mice per condition. Average of two individual experiments shows 84% of decrease in PEDF in DKO rd8
mice compared with WT. (C) Western of conditioned media from RPE of DKO and WT against anti-PEDF (15 l per lane). Standard

untreated eyes, with fewer and smaller deep retinal lesions
(Figure 2A, between arrows and 2B). Histopathologically,
the untreated retina showed focal photoreceptor degenera-
tion (Figure 2C, arrowheads), focal loss of IS/OS (inner/outer
segment of photoreceptor, Figure 2C, asterisk), and RPE
vacuolation/pigmentary alteration in addition to the rd8
associated photoreceptor dystrophic lesions in OPL (outer
plexiform layer, Figure 2C, arrows), whereas PEDF-treated
retina presented fewer/smaller photoreceptor damages (Fig-
ure 2C, arrowhead) and relatively healthy photoreceptor
IS/OS (Figure 2C, asterisk), normal RPE, but remaining rd8
associated focal photoreceptor dystrophic lesions (Figure 2C,
arrow). A total of ten pairs of eyes were histologically exam-
ined, eight mice had less lesions in PEDF-treated eyes com-
pared with the contralateral, untreated eyes, one mouse had
more lesions with PEDF treatment, and one mouse had sim-
ilar pathological changes between the two eyes (Figure 2D).
Moreover, PEDF treatment significantly reduced the levels of
lipofuscin fluorophore A2E (Figure 2E).
PEDF has anti-apoptotic effects on neuroretina
of DKO rd8 mice
As a useful tool to detect DNA fragmentation of apoptotic
cells, TUNEL assay showed less apoptotic cells in PEDF-treated
than contralateral, untreated retinas, especially in the ONL
(Figures 3A and 3B). The thickness of ONL in the PEDF-
treated eyes is significantly thicker than that in contralateral,
untreated eyes (Figure 3C). Several apoptosis-related
molecules were measured to investigate whether PEDF could
attenuate retinal lesions via apoptotic pathways. Between
PEDF-treated and contralateral, untreated eyes, Fasl (Fig-
ure 3D), Fas (Figure 3E) and Bcl2 (Figure 3F) transcripts
did not have significant differences in PEDF-treated than
the contralateral, untreated retina, while the levels of
Bax (Figure 3G) transcript were significantly decreased in
PEDF-treated retina. Immunohistochemistry showed less im-
munoreactivity against FasL in the INL (inner nuclear layer)
in PEDF-treated retina (Figure 3H) and comparable Fas in
the INL, OPL and IS/OS in PEDF-treated and the contralat-
eral, untreated retina (Figure 3I). In addition, lower Bax in
the ganglion cell layer, OPL and IS/OS (Figure 3J) and higher
Bcl-2 in the INL and OPL were observed in PEDF-treated than
the contralateral, untreated retina (Figure 3K).
PEDF inhibits angiogenic and inflammatory
molecules on neuroretina of DKO rd8 mice
There was significantly reduced expression of Tnf, Il1, Il17a,
iNos and Vegfa transcripts in PEDF-treated than the con-
tralateral, untreated retina (Figures 4AÂ­4E).
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that the PEDF level is markedly de-
creased in the retinas of DKO rd8 mice with AMD-like lesions

when compared with WT. Local administration of full-length
PEDF ameliorates focal photoreceptor and RPE degeneration
in this mouse model. More importantly, the neuroprotec-
tive effect of PEDF is associated with both anti-apoptotic
and anti-inflammatory activities on retinal neuronal cells.
PEDF-treated eyes showed fewer clinical and histopatholog-
ical lesions in the retina, with less retinal cell apoptosis and
better morphology in the ONL. Molecular studies demon-
strated decreased apoptosis and inflammation with exoge-
nous PEDF compared with the contralateral, untreated eyes.
These results are in line with previous evidence that PEDF
has neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory effects (Cayouette
et al., 1999; Cao et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2006; Pang et al.,
2007; Zhou et al., 2009).
PEDF is widely expressed throughout the human body
and displays multiple biological activities. Inside the eye, it is
found as an extracellular component of the retinal interpho-
toreceptor matrix (Wu et al., 1995; Becerra et al., 2004).
Given the neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory effects of
PEDF, it is insinuated that decreased PEDF level can lead to
neuroretinal degeneration and/or retinal cell apoptosis. As a
focal rd mouse model with certain AMD features, RPE vac-
uolation and degeneration also occur in DKO rd8 mice (Tuo
et al., 2007; Chan et al., 2008). Because RPE is a main cell
source producing PEDF in the eye, RPE abnormality could
be responsible for decreased PEDF expression in the retinas
of the DKO rd8 mouse. This observation implies that PEDF
deficiency may be one of the contributing factors causing

focal rd in this AMD mouse model, which is in agreement
with lower PEDF levels found in human RPE and choroid of
AMD patients (Bhutto et al., 2006). We propose that local
administration of PEDF may serve to restore PEDF levels in-
side the eye, exerting protective effects for the neuroretina
in the DKO rd8 mice, as well as a potential therapeutic agent
for AMD patients.
RPE is intimately associated with photoreceptors by deliv-
ering essential nutrients for photoreceptors and phagocytiz-
ing shed photoreceptor outer segments. With ageing, non-
phagocytic material accumulates in RPE as an increase of
lipofuscin (Ben-Shabat et al., 2001). The major component of
lipofuscin A2E causes further RPE damage and is regarded as
a biomarker in AMD (Ben-Shabat et al., 2001; Wolf, 2003). It is
impressive that not only PEDF treatment effectively reduced
A2E level in the RPE of DKO rd8 mice, but also improved the
structural integrity of the RPE, which in turn can facilitate
the maintenance of photoreceptor integrity.
The photoreceptors and RPE of human AMD eyes and of
DKO rd8 mice undergo apoptosis likely mediated by the FasL
and Fas system as well as the Bcl-2/Bax system (Dunaief et al.,
2002; Ding et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012). We have reported

Figure 4 Anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic effects of PEDF on the neuroretina in DKO mice
Whole retina of PEDF-treated and untreated DKO rd8 eyes was harvested and total RNA was isolated and converted to cDNA. To
determine the transcript levels of targeted gene, the mRNA levels were quantified and normalized to universal mRNA with the -actin
housekeeping gene by qRT-PCR. (A) Tnf, (B) Il1, (C) Il17a, (D) iNos and (E) Vegfa (n = 8).*indicates significant difference between

an elevated FasL-mediated RPE apoptosis under inflammation
and oxidative stress in the cultured RPE cells of DKO rd8
mouse than that of WT (Wang et al., 2012). Higher levels of
Bax transcript and lower ratios of Bcl2/Bax were also detected
in DKO rd8 mouse eyes compared with WT (Cao et al., 2010).
Interestingly, in DKO rd8 eyes, PEDF increases ONL thickness
and decreases apoptotic retinal cells with a decrease in FasL
protein, indicating that PEDF might be effective to reverse
FasL-mediated apoptosis in DKO rd8 retina. We detect that no
significant decrease of Fasl and Fas transcripts in the DKO rd8
retinas with PEDF treatment. This result could be due to the
discordant expression of transcript and protein of FasL and
Fas in DKO rd8 mouse eyes. In our previous study, we found
higher FasL and Fas protein yet comparable transcript levels
in the DKO retina compared with WT (Cao et al., 2010; Wang
et al., 2011). In the present study, PEDF significantly down-
regulated pro-apoptotic Bax protein and transcript as well as
up-regulated anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in DKO rd8 retina.
These findings are in agreement with the PEDF effects in the
retinas of Royal College Surgeons rats and retina progenitors
R28 cells in culture in which the anti-apoptotic effect of PEDF
results from induction of Bcl-2 expression to prevent nuclear
translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (Murakami et al.,
2008). An overexpression of Bcl-2 can lead to prevention
of Bax translocation and activation, resulting in lower cell
apoptosis (Murphy et al., 2000; Ku et al., 2011). Thus, the
influence of PEDF on decreasing pro-apoptotic and elevating
anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members can produce a survival
effect in the DKO rd8 retina.
Another important mechanism of AMD development is
the involvement of inflammation (Ding et al., 2009; Xu et al.,
2009; Tuo et al., 2012a). Various factors, including smoking,
oxidative stress, complement components and inflammatory
mediators contribute to parainflammation in human AMD
(Xu et al., 2009; Rutar et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Ambati
and Fowler, 2012; Colak et al., 2012; Kauppinen et al., 2012;
Tarallo et al., 2012). Retinal changes in DKO rd8 mice are
indicative of a chronic inflammatory process, immune dys-
function and activation of innate immunity (Ross et al., 2008;
Chu et al., 2012; Tuo et al., 2012b; Ramkumar et al., 2013).
Various pro-inflammatory cytokines and related molecules
have also been reported in DKO rd8 retinas and RPE.
As a multifactorial disease, retinal neurons are exposed
to the pro-inflammatory cytokines in AMD. Among them,
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 are con-
sidered as one of the primary components responsible for the
inflammatory response in AMD. Recently, several reports have
showed the involvement of IL-17 in the inflammatory patho-
genesis of AMD (Liu et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2012; Hasegawa
et al., 2013). Moreover, oxidative stress plays a role in the

PEDF protects neuroretina in an AMD model
rd in AMD. By using the DKO rd8 mouse model, our pre-
vious studies demonstrated lower transcript expression of
Tnf (Tuo et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2011; Tuo et al., 2012b;
Ramkumar et al., 2013), IL1 (Shen et al., 2011), IL17a (Tuo
et al., 2012b) and iNos (Ramkumar et al., 2013) in mouse
retina when treated with anti-inflammatory and/or neuro-
protective agents. Thus, we chose these cytokines to detect
whether PEDF has anti-inflammatory effects in this mouse
model. TNF, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is produced by
lymphocytes and macrophages, and plays a role in induc-
tion of apoptosis. IL-1, also a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is
produced mainly by macrophages and involved in cell prolif-
eration and apoptosis. iNOS, the inducible NOS plays a pivotal
role in sustained and elevated NO release. iNOS is released
under pathological conditions by inflammation and certain
cytokines, including TNF and IL-1. Elevated serum IL-17A,
a Th17 family cytokine, is reported in AMD patients (Liu et al.,
2011). Recently we have shown that IL-17a signal blockade
effectively arrested photoreceptor and RPE degeneration in
DKO rd8 mice (Ardeljan et al., ARVO abstr. #1713, 2013).
Consequently, all these pro-inflammatory molecules can in-
teract with each other to evoke apoptosis and tissue damage,
resulting in rd. The current study demonstrates that PEDF
treatment counteracts inflammatory state in neuroretina by
down-regulating the inflammatory mediators Tnf, Il1, iNos
and Il17a transcripts to ultimately ameliorate retinal damage
and contribute to fewer retinal degenerative lesions in DKO
rd8 mouse retina.
PEDF also decreases the levels of VEGF, a pro-
inflammatory molecule that plays a well-recognized role in
neovascularization (Reinders et al., 2003). Although VEGF ex-
pression is regulated largely by hypoxia and mainly involved
with CNV in neovascular AMD, VEGF/PEDF ratio favoring an-
giogenesis may promote drusen accumulation and trigger
progression towards CNV in smoker patients with dry AMD
(Pons and Marin-Castano, 2011). Pons et al. also detected
increased VEGF levels in RPE/choroids from mice under ox-
idative stress. An increased VEGF level is documented in DKO
rd8 mice (Herzlich et al., 2009; Tuo et al., 2012c; Ramkumar
et al., 2013). Thus, the reduced VEGF expression also indicated
that inflammatory and oxidative milieu of PEDF-treated DKO
rd8 eyes is lessened.
In summary, our data show that PEDF stabilizes focal pho-
toreceptor degeneration in DKO rd8 mice. The protective
mechanisms deduced from our data are via anti-apoptotic,
anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic pathways. The neu-
roprotective effect of PEDF constitutes a novel approach for
potential treatment of AMD.
