Abstract
The Cognitive Daisy is an innovative assessment system created to provide healthcare staff with
an instant snapshot of the cognitive status of older adults in residential care. The Cognitive Daisy
comprises a flower head consisting of 15 colour coded petals depicting information about: visual-
spatial perception, comprehension, communication, memory and attention. This study confirmed
the practicality of the Cognitive Daisy protocol for assessing cognition in a sample of 33 older
adults living in residential care and endorsed the use of the Cognitive Daisy as a tool for
recognising the cognitive status of care home residents.

Introduction
Dementia is a heterogeneous condition, the cognitive and behavioural sequelae of which are
modified by individual variation in brain structure (Alexander-Bloch, Giedd, & Bullmore,
2013), premorbid cognitive status (Lo & Jagust, 2013), aetiology (McKeith, 1994) and
progression (Giebel et al., 2014). Relations between cognitive dysfunction and problematic
behaviours in dementia are frequently conceptualised within a needs-driven dementia-
compromised behaviour model (Algase et al., 1996). According to this theory, needs-
driven dementia-compromised behaviours (e.g. aggressive actions) constitute expressions
of unmet needs, triggered by proximal factors (e.g. noisy environments) in people with
predisposing background factors (e.g. disinhibition). Indeed, older adults in residential
care with cognitive impairments experience increased levels of agitation (Cohen-Mansfield,

et al., 2005). Although the concept of challenging behaviour in dementia has been questioned
(Swaffer, 2015), cognitive impairment also increases the likelihood of falling (Whitney,
Close, Jackson, & Lord, 2012) and modifies how individuals with dementia express their
needs and interact with others (Morris & McKiernan, 1994). Recognising inter-individual
variation in the cognitive abilities of care home residents is therefore fundamental for the
delivery of high quality person-centred care yet poses a significant challenge for care workers
who face many emotional and physical pressures (Gandoy-Crego, Clemente, Maya
´ n-Santos,
& Espinosa, 2009).
In this paper, we introduce the Cognitive Daisy (COG-D) ­ an innovative method for
providing care staff with a succinct visual depiction of an individual's cognitive status. The
COG-D (see Figure 1) comprises a flower head consisting of 15 petals, each of which is
colour coded and corresponds to performance on a specific cognitive task (e.g. face
recognition, sustained attention, speech production, comprehension, etc.). A copy of each
resident's COG-D is placed in a discrete area of their room, in their care plan portfolio and is
displayed in the office of the care home manager. The primary aim of the COG-D is to
remind care staff at a glance of the severity of problems within different cognitive domains.
These can then be used to adjust interaction with the resident, thereby improving
communication, reducing agitation and enhancing person-centred care. Here we evaluate
the practicality of the COG-D assessment protocol and examine whether the COG-D helps
care staff to become more aware of the cognitive strengths and weaknesses of the residents
they care for. To explore these questions, COG-D was introduced to residents and care staff
in six residential care homes for older people and its usefulness was evaluated through
questionnaires completed by care staff before and after the training and intervention phase.
Method
Participants: Twenty-nine senior care staff, all of whom were women, and six men and 27
women (mean age ¼ 87.23 years, range ¼ 74­96 years) from six residential care homes in
Lincolnshire, UK participated in this study. In addition, we collected comparison data from
50 older adults (20 men/30 women; mean age ¼ 78.39 years, range ¼ 70­90 years) living in
the community. All participants gave informed consent prior to participating in the study.
The investigation was approved by the ethics committee of the School of Psychology,
University of Lincoln.
Stages of the care home study: The study comprised five stages.
(1) COG-D (neuropsychological) assessment of residents, interpretation of data and
construction of individual COG-Ds.
(2) Assessment of baseline knowledge of care staff with COG-D (I) questionnaire.
(3) The COG-D training session.
(4) Application of the COG-D: A two-week period where care staff used the COG-D on a
daily basis.
(5) Assessment of knowledge of cognitive problems and evaluation of the usefulness of the
COG-D for care staff with COG-D (II) questionnaire.
COG-D assessment: All older adults completed a 15-item test battery in the order
presented in Table 1. Variants of most of the tests used are widely deployed for assessing
2 Dementia 0(0)
the cognitive status of older adults (e.g. Mioshi, Dawson, Mitchell, Arnold, & Hodges, 2006;
Nasreddine et al., 2005). Our assessment examines five cognitive domains; visuospatial (tests
4, 10 and 15), comprehension (tests 1, 9 and 11), communication (tests 7, 8 and 13), verbal
memory (tests 2, 5 and 6) and attention (tests 3, 12 and 14). The maximum score on each test
is 8, a score of 5 or less is indicative of impairment. A research assistant administered
the tests to those participants who lived in the community; an Admiral Nurse
administered the tests to those in residential care. Each COG-D assessment took around
15 minutes to complete. Participants living in the community also completed the 6-item
cognitive impairment task (6CIT; Brooke & Bullock, 1999).
Cognitive Daisies: The data from the assessment was used to create a COG-D for each
resident. Each COG-D consisted of 15 petals (see Figure 1) representing five cognitive
domains which were colour coded as follows: visuospatial perception (blue),
comprehension (yellow), communication (purple), verbal memory (green) and attention
(red). Each domain of cognition was represented by three petals. The level of impairment
within a domain was indicated by the number of coloured petals, cognitive strengths were
depicted by white petals. If a test was not performed, the corresponding petal was coloured
grey. The position of each petal within a cognitive domain corresponded to a specific
function (e.g. blue petals depicted visuospatial perception: position 1 ¼ spatial awareness;
position 2 ¼ face recognition; position 3 ¼ object recognition). Each resident's COG-D
(85 mm Â 85 mm approx.) was displayed in a discrete but visible place in their room.

technical terms (e.g. spatial awareness ¼ `seeing both sides of the environment') of each

cognitive function associated with each petal, was included in their care-plan folder and in
the office of the care home.
COG-D training: Care staff participating in the study attended a 1.5 hour training session
led by the authors. The main objective of these sessions was to explain the concept of the
COG-D and to ensure an understanding of how the different cognitive domains were
represented by different coloured petals. Given the variation of pre-existing knowledge
about cognitive dysfunction in dementia, we described the COG-D components to care
staff using accessible language, such as seeing (visuospatial), understanding
(comprehension), communication, remembering (verbal memory) and attention. The
acronym `S-U-C-R-A' was used to facilitate learning of each term. Once all care staff
were proficient at recalling the cognitive domain corresponding to each letter, we used an
imagery exercise designed to strengthen the association between each area of cognition with
the correct colour (e.g. imagining a large blue eye was used to associate seeing with the
colour blue; imagining vivid purple lips was used to associate communication with the colour
purple, etc.). In the first phase of training, care staff were instructed that the level of
impairment within each cognitive area was denoted by the number of coloured petals
(0 ¼ none; 1 ¼ mild; 2 ¼ moderate; 3 ¼ severe). To ensure an understanding of the main
features of the COG-D, care staff were required to complete a number of exercises. First,
they were presented with a cognitive profile of a dementia case study and asked to produce a
COG-D that reflected that person's cognitive strengths and weaknesses. Second, they were
required to interpret the COG-Ds of those residents in the care home who were participating
in the study. In the second phase of the training session, care staff learned about the different
tests deployed in the COG-D assessment battery and importantly how each petal within a
cognitive domain represented the status of a specific function.
COG-D Questionnaires: Care staff completed pre and post-intervention questionnaires
referred to as COG-D (I) and COG-D (II), respectively. Both measures incorporated
open-ended questions that required care staff to list cognitive problems associated with
dementia and to state how they impact on daily life. In addition, care staff indicated on a
10-point Likert scale: (1) the importance of understanding cognitive problems for delivering
person-centred care; (2) how difficult they found it to remember residents' specific cognitive
problems; (3) whether they thought a visual prompt would be useful as a reminder of
individual cognitive difficulties. In addition to these four items, COG-D (II) also required
care staff to indicate whether they agreed with the statements: (1) it is important for residents
to have a cognitive assessment; (2) the delivery of care should take into account the unique
cognitive problems of residents; (3) the COG-D will help care staff recognise cognitive
strengths and limitations; (4) the COG-D will facilitate the delivery of care in residential
homes.
Results
Data from six community participants who scored at or above the cut-off (8) for
cognitive dysfunction on the 6CIT and one participant with an uncorrected visual
impairment were excluded from further analyses. The remaining participants (19 men/24
women; mean age ¼ 78.40 years, range ¼ 70­90 years) had a mean 6CIT score of 2.93
(range ¼ 0­6).
COG-D Assessment: Following initial observations we modified the measures of object
recognition, concept formation and visual search:
Hudson and Pollux 5
Object naming: Residents were presented with line drawings of eight everyday objects on a
computer screen and asked to name each one. Most residents were unable to name some of
the objects but could name others. We therefore decided to (1) change the format and
present each object singly; (2) use colour photographs of objects instead of drawings; (3)
replace objects that might be perceived ambiguously and present all objects from a
stereotypical viewpoint.
Concept formation: This measure involved pointing to two objects from the object naming
test that could be used to perform a specified task. Because of the problems outlined above,
we replaced this task with a standard similarities test.
Visual search: Originally this measure involved performing a coloured trails task. None of
the residents managed to complete this test and no common errors were observed. We
consequently substituted this test with a visual search task which requires residents to find
several target stimuli that are dispersed among many distractors.
All the older adults living in the community and all the care home residents bar one
completed the modified COG-D assessment battery. The mean scores for both groups on
each test are presented in Table 1. Cronbach's alpha revealed the battery had a high level of
internal consistency (15 items; a ¼ .935). Cronbach's alpha scores for each cognitive domain
(three items) were as follows: visuospatial .813, comprehension .638, communication .552,
verbal memory .817 and attention .838. Significant Spearman's correlations were found
between 6CIT months backwards and the COG-D Stroop measure of inhibitory control
[r ¼ À.407, p ¼ .007] and between 6CIT delayed recall and COG-D delayed recall [r ¼ À.586,
p ¼ .001], verbal recognition [r ¼ À.499, p ¼ .001] and Stroop [r ¼ À.427, p ¼ .004]. This
indicated concordance between 6CIT indices of working memory and consolidation and
those derived from the COG-D test battery.
COG-D Questionnaires: The cognitive problems in dementia that were named in COG-D (I)
by care staff were mainly behavioural (e.g. incontinence, aggression) or psychological (anxiety,
depression). The percentage of care staff who stated impairments pre- vs. post-intervention
which corresponded with the primary cognitive functions as depicted by the COG-D were as
follows: visuospatial (26% vs. 63%), comprehension (22% vs. 71%), communication (52% vs.
79%), memory (70% vs. 83%) and attention (11% vs. 58%). Exact McNemar's tests
determined that the COG-D intervention significantly raised awareness in care staff of
visuospatial (p¼ .006), comprehension (p ¼ .001) and attention (p ¼ .001) problems in
dementia, but not of communication (p ¼ .109) or memory (p ¼ .289) impairments.
On a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 means that the statement is strongly endorsed, all care staff
thought it was extremely important to understand the cognitive problems of residents for
delivering person-centred care in both pre (mean ¼ 9.93, SD ¼ 0.26) and post-intervention
responses (mean ¼ 9.74, SD ¼ 0.53). There was no significant difference in their pre- and
post-intervention responses [t (26) ¼ 1.727, p ¼ .096], indicating that participation in the
study had not altered their perception of this principle. On COG-D (I), many care staff
indicated that it was quite difficult to remember residents' specific cognitive problems
(mean ¼ 6.86, SD ¼ 1.92) and thought that a visual prompt would be useful (mean ¼ 8.93,
SD ¼ 1.77). As can be seen in Figure 2, post-intervention responses clearly showed that the
implementation of COG-D had made it significantly easier for them to remember the
cognitive problems of residents [t (26) ¼ 8.016, p ¼ .001, Z2 ¼ 0.71] and was rated as being
extremely useful (mean ¼ 8.89, SD ¼ 1.45). The value of COG-D was unrelated to whether
care staff thought a visual prompt of cognitive problems would be useful in the pre-training
phase [r ¼ .345, p ¼ .078]. Care staff further stated that it was important for residents to have
6 Dementia 0(0)
a cognitive assessment (mean ¼ 9.76, SD ¼ 0.58) and that the delivery of care should take
cognitive problems into account (mean ¼ 9.93, SD ¼ 0.26). Notably, they believed that the
COG-D would help staff recognise cognitive strengths and weaknesses (mean ¼ 9.82,
SD ¼ 0.55) and enhance the delivery of person-centred care (mean ¼ 9.41, SD ¼ 1.18).
Examples of qualitative responses
The whole aspect of the Daisy is very useful in order to help the staff recognise cognition strengths
and limits in order to deliver a good standard of care.
After reading the results of COG-D I was able to better support individuals in areas where I knew
there was a deficit but equally important I was able to encourage individuals to be independent with
areas where no/little deficit was present.
By using the Daisy I was able to pick up on sensory impairments and amend care notes to inform
staff. By having the information as a team we were able to approach B.R in an appropriate manner.
Reducing stress and improving communication skills. Also improved communication between health
professionals supporting B.R. By using the Daisy it gave me a better awareness of individuals'
abilities and needs ­ improving person centred care.
The way it has been explained and put into different categories i.e. the cognitive problems each
individual can have I feel is extremely useful and interesting to care staff. It is simple and easy to
understand.
The daisy would work very well to provide person centred care for all persons that are involved with
that resident from care staff to friends and family or even new staff can read the daisy and know the
resident situation.

The project was explained really well and the information is very helpful. All the team would benefit
if training was developed so they could grasp the cognitive daisy.
Discussion
Being aware of the cognitive problems of care home residents is a major challenge for care
workers yet pivotal to enhancing the delivery of person-centred care, reducing agitation and
identifying effective forms of communication. All care staff who participated in this study
rated the importance of understanding cognitive problems for the delivery of person-centred
care very highly but admitted to finding these difficult to remember. They also endorsed the
use of the COG-D as a visual representation of the cognitive status of each resident and
believed that by making cognitive strengths and weaknesses apparent the COG-D could
improve the quality of person-centred care.
The cognitive profiles of residents in this study were diverse. In fact, 88% of the COG-Ds
created were unique within the cohort. Although all residents had profound deficits recalling
recent information, on each of the other tests between 28% and 94% of residents were
unimpaired. The degree of individual variation in cognitive ability is further highlighted
by the distribution of white petals ­ which indicate no impairment. On each COG-D, the
number of white petals ranged from 1 to 12. In this study, only four residents failed to
complete a test, which suggests that the overall demand characteristics of the COG-D test
battery are appropriate.
Recognising that a resident has a specific cognitive problem can prompt care staff to
adopt a number of modifying strategies. For example, if a resident has difficulty with
speech production, care staff can modify their own interaction by giving the resident more
time to respond and keeping choices simple (Orange & Colton-Hudson, 1998). Alternatively,
the residents' behaviour might be modified by encouraging different means of
communication (Hoffman, Platt, & Barry, 1988). For instance, 24 (73%) residents in this
study have speech fluency difficulties (test 7), however, 11 of these are competent writers
(test 8) and all know how to communicate through gesture (test 13). COG-D not only
provides information on specific abilities but can also reveal details on the nature of
impairment when the status of complimentary petals is considered. For example, 8 out of
10 residents who demonstrated deficits locating objects in the visual search task (test 12)
could recognise individual objects perfectly well (test 10). The difficulty that these residents
might experience is therefore not in object recognition per se (e.g. identifying a spoon) but is
particular to situations in which many other objects are present (e.g. finding a spoon on a
table with an array of crockery and cutlery). Therefore consideration of background factors
(via the COG-D) in relation to situational factors can empower care staff with the potential
to predict and therefore avert the risk of needs-driven dementia-compromised behaviour
(Kolanowski, Litaker, & Buettner, 2005).
In addition to informing the decision making of individual care staff, COG-D can also
benefit care home teams and managers involved in the shaping of care plans, organising
activities and allocating resources. Incorporating the COG-D into care plans has a number
of advantages. First, the COG-D is derived from objective measures of cognitive abilities
that are covert and therefore not obvious to care staff. Second, the COG-D is readily
8 Dementia 0(0)
interpretable without the need to read lengthy text or understand complex terminology.
Third, new staff can readily derive an overview of the residents they will care for. Fourth,
viewing COG-Ds constructed at different stages will present health professionals and
relatives with a visual system for monitoring progression over time. It will enhance
awareness in relatives about the relationship between cognitive decline and behaviour of
residents and could serve as a basis to amend care needs appropriately.
The viewing of all COG-Ds from a care home in one place (e.g. on a wall or PC screen)
will provide home managers with an overview of common cognitive strengths and
weaknesses. This level of detail could be useful for identifying rehabilitative interventions
that might be beneficial to numbers of residents and delivered on a group basis (e.g. speech
therapy). Similarly, the identification of common strengths among residents will facilitate the
formation of groups of residents that could benefit from participating in the same
recreational activities.
It may also be viable for managers to create a `home' COG-D that portrays the
percentage of residents who are impaired in each cognitive function. This information
would be valuable to care home providers with an interest in comparing the severity of
cognitive impairment across homes within their organisation in order to guide decisions
on resources and highlighting staff training needs.
It is noteworthy that training of the concept and deployment of COG-D markedly
improved the knowledge of care staff of cognitive dysfunction in dementia. When asked
to name specific cognitive problems associated with dementia in the pre-training phase, care
staff stated more behavioural (e.g. wandering, agitation, undressing, aggression, etc.) and
psychological problems (e.g. frustration, anxiety, depression, etc.) than cognitive deficits.
Following the intervention, a significantly greater number of cognitive problems were
named. Implementation of the COG-D appears therefore to have influenced care staff to
give greater consideration to background cognitive factors (e.g. inhibitory control) which
have the potential to lead to needs-driven dementia-compromised behaviours given the
presence of proximal triggers.
This pilot investigation has provided unequivocal support for both the practicality and
usefulness of the COG-D in residential care homes. The application of the COG-D is not
exclusive to dementia. The cognitive profile of any neurological (e.g. brain injury, stroke,
Parkinson's disease, motor neurone disease, etc.) or developmental disorder (e.g. autistic
spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning difficulties, etc.) might
be usefully depicted by the COG-D following assessment with an appropriate test battery.
Notwithstanding these strengths, we acknowledge that the COG-D is still at an early stage of
development. Despite Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the total COG-D test battery
indicating a high degree of internal consistency, additional psychometric properties
including the construct validity and test-retest reliability for the assessment battery await
investigation. Furthermore, only a small proportion of residents and care staff at each home
participated in this phase of the study and the pilot ran for only two weeks. To examine the
generality of the findings reported here and to test the feasibility of the COG-D larger scale
studies are needed.
