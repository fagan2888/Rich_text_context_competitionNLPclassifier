Symptoms of paranoia were found in 9.5% of a community sample of older adults in North
Carolina. In cross-sectional analyses, these symptoms were associated most strongly with
black race, lower income and education, less exercise, and more depressive symptoms. In
longitudinal analysis, paranoid symptoms three years following initial interview were
predicted by baseline paranoid symptoms, education and depressive symptoms at the initial
interview. In blacks, paranoid symptoms may represent an appropriate response to a hostile
environment rather than a psychopathic trait.

Factors Associated With Paranoid Symptoms
in a Community Sample of Older Adults1

Symptoms of paranoia are not rare among older
adults. Christenson and Blazer (1984) found that 4%
of the elderly reported persecutory symptoms in a
community sample of elders. Lowenthal (1964) found
2.5% of community-based elders reported suspi-
ciousness and an additional 2% reported paranoid
delusions. The estimated prevalence of paranoid
psychoses in late life, however, is much lower. In the
Epidemiologic Catchment Area studies the current
(one-year) prevalence estimate for schizophrenic
disorders among persons 65 + years of age was 0.2%
(Keith, Regier, & Rae, 1991). Parsons (1964) found
1.7% of persons 65 + experienced late paraphrenia in
a Welsh town population sample. In a random sam-
ple of 612 elderly Chinese aged 65 and older, living in
Singapore, the current prevalence of paranoid disor-
der was estimated at 0.5% (Kua, 1992).
Clinical investigators have found that a variety of
factors contribute to late-life paranoid symptoms,
including a lifelong propensity toward paranoid
thought, late onset schizophrenia-like illness (late
paraphrenia or paranoid psychosis), and a maladap-
tive response to a sense of loss of control over the
environment (Eisdorfer, 1980). Among the physical
changes associated with aging, most frequently cited
as contributing to paranoid symptoms has been sen-

sory impairment. In the study previously cited
(Christenson & Blazer, 1984), poor vision and hear-
ing, along with poor self-rated mental health, poor
self-rated physical health, poor economic and social
resources, and cognitive impairment were associ-
ated with persecutory symptoms. Post (1962, 1966)
found 30% of persons with late paraphrenia to suffer
from deafness compared to 11 % of the elderly suffer-
ing from depression. Cooper, Day, and Curry (1974)
found a higher frequency of deafness among per-
sons with paranoid psychosis than in controls with
affective psychoses.
In recent years, however, the association between
sensory impairment and paranoid symptoms has
been questioned. Prager and Jeste (1993) reviewed 27
published studies examining the association be-
tween sensory (vision and hearing) impairment and
late-life psychosis with paranoid features. Though a
majority of the investigations supported the postu-
lated association between hearing impairment and
late-onset paranoid disorder, there were method-
ological limitations in these studies, such as the ab-
sence of a longitudinal perspective. These investiga-
tors also reported findings from a case-control study
in which a blind assessment of visual and hearing
impairments was used to explore this postulated
association. Due to an overall high level of sensory
deficits among older psychiatric patients, no true
differences in sensory deficits could be found be-
tween persons with paranoid psychoses and those
with other psychiatric disorders.
There is an area neglected in the study of paranoid
symptoms -- that these so-called symptoms may
express an accurate view of the environment for
certain populations in society. For example, older
persons living in inner city environments, where
drug abuse dominates the culture, may have more
than ample reason to perceive that environment as
hostile. Regardless of the etiology of paranoid symp-

toms, a study of the natural history and correlates of
these symptoms can be useful to understanding
community-dwelling elders.
To our knowledge, there are no longitudinal stud-
ies in the literature relating sensory impairment to
the onset of paranoid symptoms. We therefore ana-
lyzed data from the Piedmont Health Survey of the
Elderly (Established Populations for Epidemiologic
Studies of the Elderly Project [EPESE/Duke]) in order
to determine the influence of self-reported visual
and hearing impairment at baseline upon paranoid
symptoms three years later in a controlled analysis.
We hypothesized that paranoid thoughts at follow-
up would be associated with previously self-reported
deficits in hearing and vision, even controlling for
physical and cognitive status and paranoid thoughts
at baseline.
Methods
Sample
The data for this study derive from the Established
Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly
Project (EPESE) at Duke University Medical Center.
The population survey at Duke was part of a multicen-
ter, collaborative epidemiologic investigation of
health status in the physical, social, and cognitive
functioning of persons 65 years of age and older living
in four communities: East Boston, Massachusetts;
Iowa and Washington Counties, Iowa; New Haven,
Connecticut; and five counties in the north-central
Piedmont of North Carolina (Cornoni-Huntley et al.,
1990). The North Carolina study sample consists of
4,162 community residents 65 years of age and older
selected from Durham, Granville, Vance, Warren, and
Franklin counties of North Carolina, with each of the
counties contiguous with at least one other county in
the catchment area. Durham County is predominantly
urban, whereas the remaining four counties are pre-
dominantly rural. The population of Durham County
is approximately equal to the combined population of
the four rural counties. There is a high proportion of
blacks in all five counties, ranging at the time of the
1980 U.S. Census, from one-third in Durham County
to nearly two-thirds in Warren County.
In order to optimize both racial differences (blacks
versus non-blacks) and urban/rural differences, the
sample was drawn in order to interview approxi-
mately equal numbers of subjects from the urban
and rural counties and equal numbers of blacks and
non-blacks. Forty-eight percent of the sample were
from Durham County, and 52% were from the rural
counties. Fifty-four percent of the sample were
black, and 46% were non-black (almost exclusively
white).
A four-stage, stratified sampling design was used.
In the first stage, primary sampling units consisting
of 450 zones of approximately equal population size
were selected from each 1980 census block, block
cluster, and enumeration district. In the second
stage, a land area within each zone was selected
based on population density, and all households
within that selected land area were enumerated or
listed (n = 26,183). The housing units were stratified
by race and residence. The third stage involved
screening all listed household units for occupants
aged 65 or older. At the fourth stage, the Kish proce-
dure was used to select one person aged 65 or older
(n = 4,162) from each eligible household (Kish,
1965).
Of the 4,162 respondents, 4,000 contributed face-
to-face interviews, and 162 contributed abbreviated
proxy interviews with a close acquaintance or family
member. The proxy interviews did not include the
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale
(CES-D), so proxies were removed from the analyses.
An additional 69 respondents did not answer one or
both of the paranoia items from the CES-D, and these
persons were also omitted from all analyses. The
baseline analyses included 3,931 subjects. At follow-
up three years later, 2,936 subjects, or 88.9% of sam-
ple members alive, were interviewed.
Missing data varied for different items in the ques-
tionnaire, but were minimal except for income status
(752 respondents did not provide income data).
Measures
Paranoid symptoms were measured by two items
from the CES-D, "People were unfriendly" and "I felt
that people disliked me" (Radloff, 1977). All ques-
tions from the CES-D were included verbatim from
the original version of the questionnaire. Response
options, however, were collapsed to a yes/no format
for reporting the presence or absence of a symptom
during the week preceding the interview. The overall
correlation of CES-D scores determined by usual
methods of scoring and the modified approach was
very high (Blazer, Burchette, Service, & George,
1991). In a previous study, the psychometric proper-
ties of the CES-D, including its factor structure, were
determined in a community sample of married men
and women (Ross & Mirowsky, 1984). The factors
were, in large part, generalizable across both men
and women and included factors of depressed affect,
enervation, lack of positive affect, and interpersonal
problems. We repeated this analysis and found the
factors to be almost identical to those previously
reported, with virtually no variability by gender or
race. Two items loaded on the "interpersonal prob-
lems" factor, i.e., "I felt that people disliked me" and
"People were unfriendly." These two items were
included in the CES-D to tap the paranoid tendencies
in mood disorders. The general perception that
"People dislike me" is a phenomenon of one core
paranoid symptom, i.e., suspiciousness. The general
perception that "People are unfriendly" is a phe-
nomenon of a second core paranoid symptom, i.e.,
hypersensitivity, which notices any slight, real or
imagined. In more recent versions of the psychiatric
nomenclature, paranoid symptoms are not consid-
ered as central to any but the most severe mood
disorders, such as a severe major depression with
psychotic features, a disorder which would be ex-
tremely rare in community samples of older adults
Vol. 36, No. 1,1996 71
(DSM-IV, 1994). In the Duke EPESE sample, the two
"interpersonal problem" items are not highly correl-
ated with the remainder of the CES-D (.30 for "People
dislike me" and .29 for "People are unfriendly"), yet
they were highly related to each other. Therefore, in
these analyses, we used a positive response to either
of these items as evidence of paranoid symptoms.
The remaining 18 items of the 20-item CES-D scale
were used to estimate depression as a control
variable.
Sensory deficit variables were constructed as fol-
lows. Hearing deficit was measured dichotomously
and was counted as positive if the respondent an-
swered "no" to the item: "[With/without a hearing
aid] can you usually hear and understand what a
person says without seeing his face if that person
talks in a normal voice to you in a quiet room?" Visual
deficit was measured on a continuous scale (range 0-
6), as the sum of six items which asked, [When
wearing eyeglasses/contact lenses] "can you see well
enough to recognize a friend (1) across a street, (2)
across a room, (3) who is an arm's length away, (4) if
you get close to his face, (5) to read ordinary newspa-
per print, and (6) to read large print such as newspa-
per headlines?"
The other variables utilized were measured as fol-
lows. Age was determined by both self-report of age
and report of date of birth. When inconsistencies
arose, date of birth was used to measure age. Race
was determined by both observation and report of
race. Cognitive impairment was determined by using
the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire
(Pfeiffer, 1975). Physical disability was determined by
items derived from three physical disability scales,
the Katz scale (an activity of daily living scale), the
Nagi Scale (a functional limitations scale), and the
Rosow and Breslau Scale (a mobility scale; Katz &
Akpom, 1976; Nagi, 1976; Rosow & Breslau, 1966).
Stressful life events were determined by asking
whether a series of stressful events had occurred
during the previous year.
Analyses
We first developed a series of bivariate analyses
using the presence or absence of paranoid symptoms
at baseline and follow-up and tested the significance
of differences across the variables of interest using chi-
square and t-test statistics. Then a logistic regression
analysis using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) soft-
ware was performed, which regressed Wave 2 para-
noia status on Wave 1 paranoia status on all indepen-
dent variables and covariates measured at baseline.
Results
In Tables 1 and 2, the characteristics of the total
sample are presented. Differences in the characteris-
tics of individuals demonstrating paranoid symptoms
(compared to those without these symptoms) are
presented for each wave. Of the 3,931 subjects avail-
able for study at Wave 1, 2,936 subjects remained in
the sample at Wave 2. Paranoid symptoms were more
frequent in bivariate analyses among persons with
hearing problems, among females, among blacks,
and among persons not married at Wave 1. These
trends continued to Wave 2, except for differences
by gender disappearing. However, 69% of the sub-
jects who reported paranoid symptoms at the first
interview did not report those symptoms at the fol-
low-up interview. Therefore, paranoid symptoms ap-
pear not to persist as a trait over the follow-up inter-
val, even though the prevalence and cross-sectional
correlates are similar at both interviews.
In Table 2, vision problems, older age, less educa-
tion, lower income, impaired activities of daily living
(Katz, 1976), deficits in function (Nagi, 1976) and
mobility (Rosow & Breslau, 1966), smaller social net-
works, less social interaction, presence of negative
life events, depressive symptoms, and cognitive im-
pairment were all associated with paranoid symp-
toms at both waves. (The Katz activities of daily living
[ADL] was not significant at Wave 2, although the
trend was similar.)

In Table 3, paranoid symptoms at Wave 1 are re-
gressed on the variables shown in Table 2, estimating
two models, one including hearing problems and
one including vision problems. As can be seen, in
these cross-sectional models, neither hearing nor
vision problems are associated with paranoid symp-
toms. In addition, many of the variables found to be
associated with paranoid symptoms in bivariate anal-
yses were not associated in the multivariate logistic
analysis. Depressive symptoms, black race, less edu-
cation, lower income and lower functioning on the
Rosow-Breslau scale remain associated with para-
noid symptoms.
In Table 4, paranoid symptoms at Wave 2 are re-
gressed on paranoid symptoms at Wave 1 in two
models, one containing vision problems and one
hearing problems. As can be seen, paranoid symp-
toms at Wave 1 are a strong predictor of paranoid
symptoms at Wave 2, as are education and depres-
sive symptoms. Vision problems at Wave 1 exhibited
a weak but positive relationship to paranoid symp-
toms at Wave 2.
In order to control for potential bias, we per-
formed some additional analyses (data not shown).
First, we compared the association of hearing prob-
lems with paranoid symptoms (using alternately self-
reported and interviewer-rated hearing problems).
The regressions were virtually identical. Second, we
found that among those subjects interviewed at
Wave 2, paranoid symptoms at Wave 1 did not distin-
guish between subjects lost to follow-up and sub-
jects reinterviewed at Wave 2.

toms at follow-up in controlled analyses. A weak but
positive association was found between baseline vis-
ual impairment and paranoid symptoms at follow-up.
As noted earlier, one explanation for paranoid
symptoms in late life is a persistent paranoid thought
style over time. These data partially substantiate this
hypothesis. The strongest predictor in the models of
paranoid symptoms at Wave 2 is paranoid symptoms
three years earlier at Wave 1. Overall, however, para-
noid symptoms did not increase in frequency among
those persons followed-up three years later, and
two-thirds of those subjects who reported paranoid
symptoms at Wave 1 did not report them at Wave 2.
Given the relatively short follow-up interval, it is
difficult to determine whether age in fact is associ-
ated with increased symptoms. In cross-sectional
analyses, age did exhibit a significant positive associ-
ation with paranoid symptoms.
As has been demonstrated elsewhere (Christen-
son & Blazer, 1984), cross-sectional studies usually
find an association of paranoid symptoms with cog-
nitive status, psychiatric symptoms, social network,
and functional impairment. This was true in the bi-
variate analysis in this study. However, in a multivari-
ate analysis of the Wave 1 data, social support mea-
sures, age, gender, marital status, negative life
events, and cognitive impairment were no longer
associated with paranoid symptoms. The effect of
cognitive impairment may be lessened by controlling
for depressive symptoms. This attenuation of the
relationship with paranoid symptoms may also be
true of negative life events and social support. Race
continued to be a strong correlate of paranoid symp-
toms in multivariate analyses of the Wave 1 data, but
was not a significant predictor of paranoid symptoms
in the longitudinal analyses. Perhaps paranoid symp-
toms are state phenomena in both blacks and non-
blacks, yet phenomena determined by different fac-
tors depending upon race. In blacks, paranoid
symptoms may represent an appropriate response to
a hostile environment rather than a psychopathic
trait.
There are a number of strengths to this study. First,
the sample is a large one and is equally distributed
between blacks and non-blacks and urban and rural
residents. Follow-up was excellent for a community
study, and there were no apparent differences be-
tween individuals who were interviewed at follow-up
and those lost to follow-up. In addition, a number of
factors which could contribute to paranoid symp-
toms other than the independent variables of inter-
est (difficulty hearing and seeing) were available in
the data. These included measures of cognitive im-
pairment, functional impairment, and depressive
symptoms. The CES-D scale is useful for exploring
the relationship between paranoid symptoms and
depressive symptoms, given that the two items
within the CES-D used to assess paranoid symptoms
load on a separate factor, are highly related to each
other, and correlate less with other items in the
scale.
On the other hand, some problems are inherent in
the study design. First, only two items were used to
assess paranoid symptoms, i.e., "People were un-
friendly" and "I felt that people disliked me."
Though these items or similar items are frequently
used in scales to assess interpersonal difficulties in
paranoid thinking, they also may be based in reality.
The prevalence of paranoid symptoms using these
items, 9.5% at baseline and 8.1% at follow-up, is
somewhat higher than has been recorded for para-
noid symptoms in previous community surveys (2-
4%). The estimate is significantly higher than the
community-based estimates of schizophrenic disor-
ders in late life (which are usually well below 1% in
community samples in older adults).
A second problem is that hearing problems were
based on self-assessment. The Kappa value between
self-assessment and assessment by the interviewer
was moderate (.36). The models did not change,
however, when interviewer-rated rather than self-
reported hearing problems were used. We recognize
that self-reported hearing problems cannot be auto-
matically assumed to represent true difficulties with
hearing, nor does lack of report of hearing problems
necessarily assure that hearing problems are not
present. Another problem might be that assessment
of visual problems was based on a scale that included
multiple items, rather than simply asking whether
the subject suffered from visual impairment or not
(in contrast to the assessment of hearing difficulties).
Using EPESE data from other sites, Salive et al. (1992)
found that, while there was some discordance, self-
reports of visual acuity correlated well with the mea-

sured activity. Therefore, the concordance between
self-report and interviewer report (or measurement)
varies by the sensory modality measured.
Finally, the reader must not equate the findings in
this paper with the considerable literature on the
relationship between perceptual problems and late
life paraphrenia (or schizophrenic disorders in late
life). Though there clearly is an association between
schizophrenia-like disorders and endorsement of
items used in this survey, persons responding posi-
tively on the items used in this study include many
more individuals than would have been identified
with a standardized interview for psychiatric disor-
ders. Even so, we believe it important to explore the
correlates and temporal relationships of paranoid
symptoms in community samples, irrespective of
diagnosis.
