Incidence and Circumstances of Nonfatal
Firearm-Related Injuries Among Children
and Adolescents
Elizabeth C. Powell, MD, MPH; Edward Jovtis; Robert R. Tanz, MD
Objective: To describe the incidence and circum-
stances of nonfatal firearm-related injuries among chil-
dren and adolescents treated in US emergency depart-
ments.
Design: Data were obtained from the Firearm Injury Sur-
veillance Study, 1993-1997; data were collected through
medical record review at hospitals participating in the
National Electronic Injury Surveillance System.
Setting: The hospitals participating in National Elec-
tronic Injury Surveillance System are a stratified prob-
ability sample of all US hospitals.
Main Outcome Measures: Numbers and population
rates for nonfatal firearm-related injuries among chil-
dren and adolescents younger than 20 years old.
Results: An estimated 115131 (95% confidence inter-
val, 76769-153493) children and adolescents were treated
for a nonfatal gunshot wound during the study period.
The estimated annual rates of injury (per 100000) were
2.0 (children 0-4 years old), 2.2 (children 5-9 years old),
15.4 (children 10-14 years old), and 106.5 (adolescents
15-19 years old). The ratios of nonfatal to fatal firearm-
related injuries were 4.0 (children 0-4 years old), 4.4 (chil-
dren 5-9 years old), 5.0 (children 10-14 years old), and
4.4 (adolescents 15-19 years old). An additional esti-
mated 103814 children (95% confidence interval, 69223-
138405) were shot with a nonpowder firearm (BB or pel-
let gun). Boys 5 to 9 and 10 to 14 years old had the highest
rates of injury related to nonpowder firearms, an esti-
mated 36.2 and 99.8 per 100000, respectively. Fifty-six
percent of those 15 to 19 years old were assault victims.
An estimated 48% of children and adolescents with pow-
der firearm­related gunshot wounds and an estimated
4% with nonpowder firearm injuries were admitted to
the hospital.
Conclusions: Nonfatal injuries related to powder fire-
arms and nonpowder firearms (BB or pellet guns) are an
important source of injury among US children and ado-
lescents. Ongoing surveillance of nonfatal firearm-
related injury among children and adolescents is needed.

THE RATE OF firearm deaths
among US children far ex-
ceeds that in other industri-
alized nations.1 Nonfatal
firearm injuries outnumber
injuryfatalities,however,informationabout
them is limited.2-4 While the first compre-
hensive national estimates of nonfatal fire-
arm-related injuries reported in 1995 pro-
vided much needed information, they
provided limited details about injured chil-
dren.5 Although firearm-related death rates
appear to have declined since the mid-
1990s, they remain a common cause of in-
jury death.6,7 Because detailed national data
are lacking, we present national estimates,
based on data from a representative sample
of US hospitals, on the number of children
and adolescents with nonfatal gun-related
injuries treated in US emergency depart-
ments (EDs) over a 5-year period.
RESULTS
From January 1993 through December
1997 there were 6705 nonfatal gun-
related injuries to children and adoles-
cents between 0 and 19 years old re-
ported through NEISS. Using the NEISS
weightings, there were an estimated
244822 injuries (95% confidence inter-
val, 172844-316800) in this age group
treated in US hospital EDs. Table 1 gives
the distribution of gunshot wounds and
other injuries by weapon type (powder or
nonpowder firearm). Ninety percent of the
injuries were the result of a gunshot
wound: the remaining 10% were other fire-
arm-related injuries and included being
struck with a pistol or the butt of a gun,
or being injured from weapon recoil or
from parts of the firearm during clean-

ing. Overall, nonpowder injuries accounted for slightly
less than half of the cases.
The estimated annual rates of powder firearm­
related gunshot wounds by age, sex, and race are listed
in Table 2. The ratio of nonfatal to fatal firearm-
related injuries ranged from 4.0 to 5.0 across the age
groupings. Rates of nonfatal powder firearm­related gun-
shot wounds by age, sex, and race were calculated: among
those younger than 14 years, nonfatal powder firearm
wound rates (per 100000) were 5.8 (white males), 1.0
(white females), 10.8 (Hispanic males), 3.8 (Hispanic fe-
males), 23.6 (black males), and 8.0 (black females). More
specifically, within the group of 10- to 14-year-old males,
the rates of nonfatal powder firearm­related gunshot
wounds (per 100000) were 14.6 for whites, 27.9 for His-
panics, and 60.8 for blacks; for males 15 to 19 years old
the rates (per 100000) were 52.7 for whites, 307.4 for
Hispanics, and 624.5 for blacks.
The highest annual rates of penetrating trauma from
nonpowder firearms (BB or pellet guns) were among males
10 to 14 years old, 99.8 per 100000. Males 5 to 9 years
old had a rate of 36.2 per 100000 and those 15 to 19 years
old had a rate of 47.6 per 100000. A comparison of the
age-specific rates among males of nonfatal gunshot
wounds from powder firearms and from nonpowder fire-
arms is shown in the Figure. Rates of nonpowder firearm-
related injuries increased with age among school-aged
boys, peaked in 13-year-olds, and declined thereafter.
Powder firearm­related gunshot wounds showed mi-
nor variation by year of age between the ages of 5 and
10 years old; between the ages of 11 and 18 years old the
rates of nonfatal injury increased by 50% to 100% for each
year of age. The rates of powder firearm­related wounds
first exceeded rates of nonpowder firearm injuries among
15-year-olds.
Thecircumstancesoftheinjury,byage,forallfirearm-
related injuries are given in Table 3. Among those aged
14 years and younger, unintentional nonpowder firearm
injuries were most common; less than 10% were assaults.
Of those with powder firearm injuries, an estimated 47%
were unintentional and an estimated 41% attributed to as-
saults(datanotshowninTable3).Amongadolescentsaged
15 to 19 years, an estimated 19% of powder firearm inju-
ries were unintentional and an estimated 66% were as-
saults. The proportions were reversed for nonpowder fire-
arm injuries: an estimated 64% of BB or pellet gun injuries
were unintentional and an estimated 15% were assaults
(data not shown in Table 3).
In almost half of the cases, the shooter was not re-
ported. In cases for which this information was avail-
able, a minor fraction of the injuries were the conse-
quence of a shooting by a stranger: most wounds were

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We obtained data from the Firearm Injury Surveil-
lance Study, 1993-1997, from the National Archive
of Criminal Justice Data.8 Firearm Injury Surveil-
lance Study, 1993-1997, data were collected at hos-
pitals participating in the National Electronic Injury
Surveillance System (NEISS) through an agreement
between the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention and the Consumer Product Safety Commis-
sion.5 The NEISS data have been used routinely by
the Consumer Product Safety Commission to moni-
tor injuries related to consumer products, including
nonpowder guns.9 Prior to June 1992, the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission did not rou-
tinely collect data on injuries related to powder
firearms.
The hospitals participating in NEISS are a strati-
fied probability sample of all US hospitals and in-
cludes children's hospitals. Data obtained from these
hospitals can be weighted to provide unbiased, statis-
tically valid national estimates of product-related in-
juries.9 The sampling frame of NEISS was updated in
1997 to include 101 hospitals and a stratum for chil-
dren's hospitals; from 1993-1996 NEISS consisted of
91 hospitals. An analysis of weighted data collected
from both NEISS samples during an 8-month overlap
in 1997 indicated that differences in the national es-
timates of firearm-related injuries were less than 1%,
thus no statistical adjustments were made to adjust for
the sampling frame.7 Additional information about the
NEISS sample is available from us on request.
Gun-related injuries were defined as those cases
in which a gun was involved in the incident and in-
cluded powder burns, pistol-whipping, recoil inju-
ries, and injuries sustained during cleaning of the
weapon, as well as penetrating gunshot wounds. Some
of the gun-related injuries were from nonpowder fire-
arms (BB and pellet guns).5 Only those who were alive
at the time of discharge from the ED were counted.
Cases from each hospital were assigned a sample
weight by NEISS; national injury estimates were pro-
duced by summing the sample weights. The 95% con-
fidence intervals of these estimates were calculated
based on SEs for firearms reported by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.5,7 National vital
statistics data for 1993-1997 from the National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics were used to report firearm
deaths.10 The US Census estimates for 1995, the me-
dian year of the sample, were used to calculate age-
and race-specific injury incidence rates.11 Race-
specific rates are reported as white (non-Hispanic) and
black; rates for those of Hispanic ethnicity are also
reported.

self-inflicted or inflicted by a relative or friend. The place
where the injury occurred was unknown in 47% of the
cases (49% of the powder firearm cases, 45% of the non-
powder firearm cases). Of cases for which the location
of injury was known, it was most often the home (31%,
n=76549) or the street (12%, n=28542). School ac-
counted for an estimated 1% (n=2479) of firearm-
related injuries among those in this group, most of whom
were of school age.
The primary body part affected by a gunshot
wound with a powder firearm was the leg or foot (37%,
n=42619), upper trunk (17%, n=19339), arm or hand
(16%, n=18082), head or neck (15%, n=17381), or
lower trunk (14%, n=15890). The most common ana-
tomical sites of injury with nonpowder firearms were
the head or neck (33%, n=34596), arm or hand (30%,
n=31202), and leg or foot (23%, n=23698). Nonpow-
der firearms were associated with more wounds to the
head or neck and arm or hand than were powder
firearms (2 test, P.01 for each). An estimated 48% of
children and adolescents with powder firearm­related
gunshot wounds were admitted to the hospital; 4%
with injuries related to nonpowder firearms were
admitted to the hospital. Between 1993 and 1997, the 5
years of the study period, the annual estimated number
of nonfatal firearm-related injuries among children and
adolescents aged 0 to 19 years declined from 57047
(95% confidence interval, 34573-79521) in 1993 to
38386 (95% confidence interval, 22662-54110) in
1997.
COMMENT
These data indicate that from 1993-1997 an estimated
800 children younger than 10 years old were shot with
a powder firearm each year, and an additional 5400 had
some other firearm-related injury or were shot with a non-
powder firearm (BB or pellet gun). Among those 10- to
14-years-old, an estimated 2900 had gunshot wounds,
and an estimated 11600 were shot with a nonpowder fire-
arm or had some other powder firearm­related injury.
Most of the injuries were unintentional, and they oc-
curred in the home disproportionately on the weekend.
Treating physicians did not consider the injuries trivial:
almost half of those with powder firearm­related inju-
ries were admitted to the hospital.
Prior national estimates of the number of nonfatal
firearm-related injuries among children are limited. Es-
timates from the first year of the Firearm Injury Surveil-
lance Study, 1993-1997, were published in 1995. In that
analysis, the 2 age groupings that included children and
adolescents were 0- to 14- and 15- to 24-year-olds. There
were an estimated 3768 gunshot wounds among those
younger than 15 years.5
An analysis of firearm-related injuries in 3 Ameri-
can cities, Memphis, Tenn; Seattle, Wash; and Galves-
ton, Tex, from 1992 through 1994, showed rates (per
100000) for children 0 to 14 years old of 6.7 (white
males), 16.4 (Hispanic males), 62.0 (black males), 4.7
(white females), 16.8 (Hispanic females), and 27.5 (black
females).3 As observed in the 3 cities, the national esti-
mates suggest nonfatal firearm-related injuries dispro-
portionately affect minority youth. It is not surprising the
national estimates of nonfatal firearm-related injuries are

lower: firearm fatalities have been observed to be higher
in cities than in nonmetropolitan areas.12 Both local and
national data about nonfatal firearm-related injuries are
needed. Local data aid in the evaluation of area-specific
programs, while national data allow us to recognize na-
tional trends and discuss national priorities.
These data suggest that as gunshot wounds related
to BB or pellet guns among young teens declined, rates
of gunshot wounds related to powder firearms in-
creased. This trend was observed among males in all race
and ethnicity groups. Others have reported injury rates
related to nonpowder firearms to be highest among 5-
to14-year-old males.13 Injuries related to nonpowder
firearms infrequently resulted in hospital admission.
Case series suggest that BB or pellet gun injuries can be
serious.14-16
Because of several recent shootings in schools, pub-

These national data indicate that a small proportion of
firearm injuries occur at school. Although the actual es-
timates of the numbers of nonfatal firearm injuries at
school must be interpreted with caution because such low
estimates are unstable, it is clear that most firearm-
related injuries among school-aged children occur at
home. While making schools safe havens from firearm
violence is essential, allocation of resources to prevent
firearm-related injuries must acknowledge the prepon-
derance of injuries at home.
The distribution of injuries by anatomical area among
those younger than 20 years that we report was similar
to that reported for firearm-related gunshot wounds
among all ages.5 Nonpowder firearms were associated with
more head or neck and upper extremity injuries.
An estimated 40% of injuries among both children
younger than 15 years and those 15 to 19 years old oc-
curred on the weekend. This implies that firearms, or time
to use firearms, are more available to children and ado-
lescents during the weekend.
The NEISS has been observed to have several limi-
tations for capturing information on nonfatal firearm-
related injuries. The estimates are imprecise, as indi-
cated by the wide confidence intervals. This also limits
analysis of groups stratified by race or sex. However, we
observed that the average annual incidence of firearm in-
jury among children 0 to 14 years old, 3719, calculated
using data from 5 years (1993-1997), was similar to the
estimate reported for June 1992 through May 1993 (3768),
implying year-to-year stability of the estimates.5
Much of the imprecision results from variation in
the number of gunshot wound cases treated at NEISS
sample hospitals, which is affected by the level of care
provided in the ED, the location of the hospital, and the
patient population that is served. Not all firearm-related
injuries are brought to medical attention and treated in
the ED. While this would not affect the validity of the
estimates we present for children treated in the ED, it
would result in an underestimate of injuries.
Information about the circumstances of the injury
incident was incomplete, as some medical records were
missing firearm type, location of the injury, and the victim-
shooter relationship. Therefore, we do not report the spe-
cific type of powder firearm (handgun or long gun). We
report location of injury based on the available data. De-
spite incomplete data, it is useful to review the available
information about injury circumstances, as any detail
about the circumstances of injury among children is im-
portant for a better understanding of these injuries.
There are many social and cultural barriers to pro-
tecting children from firearms. It is clear that many chil-
What This Study Adds
Information about the rates of nonfatal firearm-related
injury among children and adolescents is limited. Na-
tional data suggest the ratio of nonfatal to fatal firearm-
related injuries is 2.6:1. This review of NEISS data (1993-
1997) suggests the rates (per 100000) of nonfatal gunshot
wound injuries ranged from 2.0 (children 0-4 years old)
to 106.5 (adolescents 15-19 years old). The age group­
specific ratios of nonfatal to fatal firearm-related inju-
ries were between 4.0 and 5.0. Nonfatal injuries related
to firearms are an important cause of injuries among
youth; ongoing surveillance of nonfatal firearm-related
injuries is needed.

dren and young adolescents have ready access to both
powder and nonpowder firearms. Most injuries are un-
intentional, and few are inflicted by strangers. It is es-
sential that the burden of firearm-related injury among
youth be recognized and efforts made to decrease guns
from the environments of children and adolescents.
