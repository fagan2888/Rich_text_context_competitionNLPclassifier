OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of adjusting for differences in timing of maturation when assessing overweight prevalence
among adolescents in different populations by using an international reference recommended by the WHO.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional, comparative study in three large samples from China, Russia and the United States.
SUBJECTS: A total of 2014 American, 1316 Chinese and 744 Russian non-pregnant adolescent girls aged 10 ± 18 y.
MEASUREMENTS: Data on body weight, height, menarcheal status and age at menarche (AAM) were collected. Overweight
was de®ned as age-sex-speci®c body mass index (BMI) greater than the 85th percentiles from the US NHANES I data (collected
in 1971 ± 1974), which is recommended by the WHO for international use. Maturity adjustments were made using population
differences in median age at menarche (MAM), calculated using the status quo method. MAM was 12.8 in the WHO reference
population, 13.7 in China, 13.2 in Russia, and 12.6 in the US (NHANES III data). Maturation age-matched BMI cut-offs were
used to compute the adjusted prevalence. We also compared population-adjusted results with individually adjusted results in
post-menarcheal American girls (based on each girl's AAM) and in pre-menarcheal girls (based on breast stage).
RESULTS: Maturity adjustment increased the estimated prevalence of overweight in China and Russia where girls mature later
than the reference population, and decreased it in the NHANES III sample. The unadjusted and adjusted prevalence was 3.5 vs
4.9% in the China sample, 8.3 vs 9.7% in Russia, and 29.2 vs 28.0% in the US. The adjustment had a greater effect in younger
adolescent girls (10 ± 13 y) than in older girls (14 ± 18 y). In general, we found a good agreement between the population and
individual adjustments. Viewing the individual adjustment as a `gold standard', the population method has a high sensitivity and
speci®city.
CONCLUSION: This is the ®rst study to assess WHO recommendations for maturation adjustment when estimating overweight
prevalence in different countries. While the overall effects of adjustment are small, maturation status should be considered,
particularly when assessing young adolescents, and populations with markedly different timing of maturation relative to the
international reference. Population-based adjustment is useful and practical in situations where individual maturity data are not
available.

Introduction
Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic and the preven-
tion of childaadolescent obesity is recognized as a public
health priority.1 ± 4 Since obesity in adolescence predicts adult
obesity and is associated with chronic diseases, it is critical to
understand current trends among adolescents. However, a
serious impediment is the lack of a widely accepted reference
for the de®nition of adolescent obesity. Accurate estimation
of obesity prevalence is critical for allocating health
resources and developing effective population intervention
strategies, as well as for studying the causes of obesity at a
population level.

Since direct measurement of adipose tissue is not feasible
in large-scale studies or population monitoring programs,
simple anthropometric indices such as the body mass index
(BMI  kgam2) are recommended to identify overweight chil-
dren and adolescents.5 ± 7 Further, the World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) and the International Obesity Task Force
(IOTF) advocate universal BMI references for international
use.6,7 The WHO de®nes `at risk of overweight' as an age-sex-
speci®c BMI greater than the 85th percentile of a reference
based on the US First National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES I) data collected in 1971 ±
1974.5
One dif®culty in using the WHO reference for interna-
tional comparisons is that it re¯ects the average distribution
of maturational status in the US population in the early
1970s. However, remarkable differences in growth and
maturation patterns exist within and between different
populations.8 ± 11 Failure to account for population and indi-
vidual differences in maturation status may lead to misclas-
si®cation of youths who differ markedly in rates of growth
and maturation from the reference population.12
Ample biological and epidemiological evidence suggests
that maturation should be considered when studying obesity
in adolescents, especially when comparing obesity preva-
lence in different populations. First, a large literature shows
that maturation status is associated with fatness.12 ± 20 In fact,
fatness and BMI are more closely correlated with maturation
stage (or development age) than chronological age.14,21
Maturational timing affects current body fatness and has a
long-term effect.20 ± 26 Earlier maturing children and adoles-
cents have greater rates of increase in fatness and a higher
percentage body fat and BMI than later maturing youth of
the same chronological age.19 ± 21,25,26 Second, marked differ-
ences in maturation and growth patterns characterize differ-
ent populations. For example, median age at menarche
(MAM) can be as early as 12 ± 13 y in some wealthy popula-
tions and as late as 14 ± 16 y in many developing coun-
tries.9,27 Third, as noted by the WHO committee, although
adolescent anthropometry varies remarkably worldwide,
many of the differences observed according to chronological
age categories are attributable to variation in maturational
timing, and the difference diminishes when maturation is
considered.6 For example, in their study of a large cohort of 9
to 10-y-old American girls, Morrison et al18 found that black
girls were fatter than whites, but after adjusting for matura-
tion stage, no racial difference in BMI and skinfold thickness
remained. Finally, there has been a secular trend toward
earlier maturation. MAM has been fallen from 16 ± 17 y in
the nineteen century to 13 ± 14 y in the 1960 ± 1970s in many
European countries,9 and to 12.8 in the US by the 1970s.28,29
The WHO recommends conditioning the interpretation
of adolescent BMI on sex, age and maturation.6 However, it
is often not feasible to collect detailed individual maturation
data in large-scale studies, especially in developing countries.
Therefore, research on population-level adjustment for
maturation differences is of great interest and has important
public health implications. To our knowledge, no attempt
has been made to explore the implications of the WHO
recommendations. The purpose of the present study is to
examine how accounting for maturation affects prevalence
estimates of overweight in adolescents. We use population-
based information to adjust for the difference in maturation
rates between the reference and study populations, based on
recommendations from the WHO committee.6 Data from
adolescents in China, Russia and the United States are used
to illustrate the method. Our results provide valuable infor-
mation for the interpretation of published results on adoles-
cent obesity from different countries, especially for
comparisons between developed and developing countries.
Materials and methods
Data and study samples
Non-pregnant girls aged 10 ± 18 y who were surveyed in
China, Russia and the US were studied. Boys were not
studied since data on maturation events were not available
except for the US.
The China Health and Nutrition Surveys (CHNS, 1991 ±
1993).* The CHNS covered eight provinces that vary sub-
stantially in geography, economic development, public
resources and health indicators. Anthropometric measure-
ments were carried out by trained health workers who
followed standard protocol similar to the NHANES protocol
developed by NCHS. Weight was measured in light indoor
clothing to the nearest tenth of a kilogram with a beam
balance scale. Height was measured without shoes to the
nearest tenth of a centimeter, using a portable stadiometer.
Information on menarcheal status and age at menarche
(AAM) was collected for girls aged 16 or less. The analysis
sample included 1316 girls who had complete anthropome-
try and socio-demographic data from either the 1991 or 1993
CHNS survey. Whenever an individual's anthropometry data
were not available in 1993, her 1991 data were used. The
1991 data for those who were older than 18 y in 1993 but
between 10 and 18 in 1991 were used.
The Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS,
1996).{ The RLMS survey was the ®rst nationally repre-
sentative household survey in the Russian Federation. All
members of more than 6400 households from all regions of
Russia were surveyed seven times from 1992 to 1996. We
used the 1996 data. Weight and height were measured.
Menarcheal status and AAM were asked of girls aged 16
and under. A total of 744 adolescents were studied.

The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III, 1988 ± 1994). The third NHANES,
conducted in two phases between 1988 and 1994, was a
cross-sectional representative sample of the US civilian non-
institutionalized population aged 2 months and older.
NHANES III over-sampled blacks, Mexican Americans, chil-
dren under 5, and the elderly (  60 y). Detailed descriptions
of the sample design and operation of the survey were
published elsewhere.31 Standardized protocols were used
for all interviews and examinations. Data on weight and
height were collected for each individual. Maturation status,
including breast stage for girls, was evaluated by physicians
in the physical examination. Menarcheal status and AAM
were reported by individuals over 8 y of age. A sample
of 2014 adolescents was included in our analysis. Based on
self-reported race and ethnicity information, subjects
were classi®ed into three groups: non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, and `other', which includes Hispanics,
Native Americans and Asians.
De®nitions of overweight. We used the WHO reference to
de®ne overweight as BMI  the age ± sex-speci®c BMI 85th
percentile, which was based on the US NHANES I data
collected in 1971 ± 1974.5,6 Since the WHO BMI cut-offs are
presented only in whole years, we ®tted BMI cut-offs to age
using a polynomial speci®cation. The curve had a nearly
perfect ®t (R2 b 0.999; sum of squared residuals was ` 0.03)
and the predicted BMI cut-offs and the original WHO cutoffs
matched perfectly. An important advantage of using the
predicted values is that decimal ages of subjects could be
used to make more precise individual adjustments, but this
might slightly lower our prevalence estimates compared to
using the original WHO BMI cut-offs.
Median age at menarche. Menarche is the most widely
used indicator of sexual maturation in girls, and is typically
used for comparison of maturation rates between popula-
tions. We used the status quo method with probit analysis to
calculate MAM for each sample. For American girls, we also
calculated median ages at breast stage 2 (MABS2) as recom-
mended by WHO.6 The status quo method is recommended
to estimate MAM (or MABS) from cross-sectional data.8,9
Only data on each individuals' current age (in years rounded
to 0.1 in our analysis) and menarcheal status (yes or no) are
needed. Compared with retrospective methods based on
individuals' reported AAM, this method suffers less from
recall errors.
Estimated MAM in each sample is shown in Table 1, along
with results from other studies. American girls matured ear-
lier (MAM  12.3) than Chinese (MAM  13.7) and Russian
girls (MAM  13.2). Sample weights were used in the estima-
tion of MAM in the Russia and US samples to account for
sampling design. China survey sample weights were not
available. As shown in Table 1, in general, our ®ndings
were consistent with previous studies in China and
Russia.32 ± 36 Very few nationally representative studies on
AAM in American girls have been published during the
past decade, although evidence indicates that MAM declined
from 12.8 to about 12.3 ± 12.6 y during the late 1960s and
early 1980s.29,37 ± 39 Recently, Herman-Giddens et al found a
MAM of 12.9 in white girls and 12.2 in black girls, while
median age at breast stage 2 (MABS2) declined to 10.0 and
8.9 in white and black girls, respectively.40 The MABS2 for
the NHANES III population was 10.2. For the WHO reference
population, MABS2 was 10.6, and MAM, 12.8,6 which is the
same as our calculated MAM using NHANES I data. The
difference in MAM between the reference population and
study samples was 0.9 for Chinese girls, 0.4 for Russian girls,
and 7 0.2 for American girls.
Method used to estimate overweight prevalence adjusting
for maturation
Based on the WHO committee's recommendation, we pro-
posed a population-based adjustment method. The WHO
committee recommends that `when population estimates of
maturational status are available, age-speci®c means or med-
ians for anthropometry may be adjusted for rates of matura-
tion that differ from the reference data.' They recommend
using data on two maturational events when available, one
to signal the beginning of the adolescent spurt and another
to indicate that peak height velocity has been attained. In
girls, the recommended markers are breast stage 2 and
menarche.6 In our method, to calculate adjusted overweight
prevalence, we ®rst estimated each subject's maturation age
(MA) as her chronological age (CA) plus the differences
between the MAM in the reference and study populations
(MA  CA  (12.8 7 MAM)). To follow the WHO's recom-
mendation, for American girls, MABS2 was also used
(MA  CA  1a2((12.8 7 MAM)  (10.6 7 MABS2))). Based on
our results and other related ®ndings, we chose to adjust for
the maturation differences as 0.9 for Chinese girls
(  13.7 7 12.8), 0.4 for Russian girls (  13.2 7 12.8), and
7 0.3 for American girls (  1
2
((12.6 7 12.8) 
(10.2 7 10.6))). Then, MA-matched BMI cut-offs were used
to evaluate each individual's nutritional status. This method
was called `population adjustment' and the calculated preva-
lence, as `adjusted prevalence', while the prevalence using CA-
matched BMI cut-offs was called `unadjusted prevalence'.
The purpose of the adjustment was to account for sys-
tematic differences in maturation rate between populations
or over time. This method made two main assumptions.
First, MA is a more important determinant of BMI and
fatness than CA, which is supported by longitudinal stu-
dies.19 ± 21,25,26 Second, to calculate an individual's MA we
assume that the entire population distribution of menarch-
eal age is shifted. Although in general our analyses with the
NHANES I and III data supported this assumption, it is
possible that true MA was over- or underestimated in some
adolescents or groups. However, we expect this happened
randomly, and as a result, the potential mis-classi®cation of
MA would not systemically bias the prevalence estimate.

Comparison of population and individual adjustments
Although it is desirable to have a `gold standard' of adoles-
cent overweight to validate our method, such a standard is
not currently available. Therefore, to evaluate the popula-
tion adjustment, we compared population adjustment with
an adjustment based on each individual's maturation status
(called `individual adjustment'). Each girl's AAM (for postme-
narcheal girls) or breast stage (for premenarcheal girls) was
used to calculate her MA relative to the reference population
(called `MA2'). Then, MA2-matched BMI cut-offs were used
to determine each individual's overweight status. This gen-
erated `individually adjusted prevalence'. We expect the indivi-
dual adjustment to be more accurate. This comparison was
possible only for American girls, who had good individual
maturation data on breast stage and AAM.
For each post-menarcheal girl, MA2 was calculated as:
MA2  CA  (12.8 7 (AAM  0.5)) (12.8 is the MAM in the
reference; AAM was corrected by  0.5 since age in whole
years at last birthday was reported). For pre-menarcheal girls,
since median age at each breast-stage was not available from
NHANES I data we used a mixed population ± individual
adjustment. For each subject, by comparing her CA and
breast stage (eg stage n) to the median age for that stage
(MABSn) in NHANES III girls, we estimated her MA relative to
all NHANES III girls (  CA  (MABSn 7 CA)  MABSn). The
underlying rationale is that girls who were at the same breast

stages had the same MA. MABS could not be calculated for
stage 1 using the status quo method, therefore only preme-
narcheal girls at breast stage 2 and over were studied. Then,
assuming pubertal events (ie breast stages), occurred on
average 0.3 y earlier in NHANES III girls than the reference
girls, we calculated each girl's MA2 (  MABSn  0.3).
Data analysis
We compared population adjusted and unadjusted preva-
lence of overweight in all of the samples, and individual and
population adjustments in American girls. For the compar-
ison of population and individual adjustments, results from
individual adjustment were used as the `gold standard', and
sensitivity and speci®city of the population method were
estimated.41 Since our main purpose is to examine how the
adjustment may affect estimates of overweight prevalence,
but not to estimate the accrual prevalence of overweight,
sampling weights were not used to compute the prevalence.
Analysis was performed by using SAS Version 6.12 (SAS, Cary,
NC, USA) and Stata Version 6.0 (Stata Co., College Station,
TX, USA).
Results
Characteristics of the study populations
Characteristics of the study populations are summarized in
Table 2, which shows that the American girls were taller and
heavier than the Chinese and Russian girls.
Prevalence of overweight
Chinese girls. As shown in Figure 1 and Table 3, the
adjusted overweight prevalence (4.9%) was higher than the
un-adjusted prevalence (3.5%). The adjustment had a greater
effect among younger adolescents (10 ± 13 y) than older
adolescents (14 ± 18 y), and in urban than in rural girls. The
adjusted prevalence in urban areas might have been over-
estimated since MAM in urban girls was only 0.4 y later than
the WHO reference. If urban and rural prevalence rates were
adjusted separately to account for the urbanarural difference
in maturation, the adjusted prevalence in urban girls was
2.9%, which was still higher than the unadjusted prevalence
(2.6%). Among rural girls, the difference between the unad-
justed and rural-speci®c adjusted prevalence (3.8% vs 5.3%)
was even greater. Girls classi®ed as overweight using the
adjustment but not overweight without the adjustment
(n  19) tended to be younger (12.5 vs 14.1 y) and thinner
(BMI, 22.0 vs 25.4 kgam2) than girls who were classi®ed as
overweight with both methods (n  46), but the differences
were not statistically signi®cant (P b 0.05).
Russian girls. Adjustment of each Russian girl's age
by 7 0.5 y resulted in an increase in the estimated prevalence
(8.3% unadjusted vs 9.7% adjusted, see Figure 1 and Table 3).
A greater impact of the adjustment was found in younger
and rural girls. Girls classi®ed as overweight with the adjust-
ment but not overweight without the adjustment (n  10)
were slightly younger (13.2 vs 14.2 y) and signi®cantly thin-

American girls. Table 4 shows that the adjusted over-
weight prevalence was lower than the unadjusted preva-
lence, but the difference was relatively small (28.0% vs
29.2%). Younger girls and girls of `other' race were most
affected by the adjustment. Black girls were the least
affected, although their MAM (12.2) was the most different
from the reference population (12.8). One possible reason for
the racial difference in the effect of adjustment is due to their
different BMI distributions. A girl whose BMI was already far
above the 85th percentile cut-off was not likely to be reclas-
si®ed with adjustment. Black girls tend to have higher BMI,
and a higher percentage are above the 95th percentile of the
reference.3
Comparison of population and individual adjustment.
Tables 5 and 6 compare the population and individual
adjustments in American girls. Overweight was more pre-
valent in post-menarcheal than in pre-menarcheal girls. In
general, there was a good agreement between the two adjust-
ment methods. The individual adjustment was assumed as a
`gold standard', although this is open to question. In post-
menarcheal girls, the population-method did not adjust for
maturity as adequately as the individual-adjustment. The
agreement was better in older girls (96.8% of these girls
were classi®ed into the same categories by the two methods,
ie overweight or not) than in younger girls (94.3%, P ` 0.05).
Nevertheless, the population-method has a high sensitivity
(97.4%) and speci®city (96.5%). Among pre-menarcheal
girls, the two adjustments produced the same estimate of
overall overweight prevalence, although the gap between the
two adjustments was bigger in black girls than other girls.
The sensitivity and speci®city of the population adjustment
were 88.8% and 96.2%, respectively. The results also support
our expectation that, although the population adjustment
may misclassify some individuals, it could give an un-biased
estimate of overweight prevalence.
Discussion
The increase of obesity in children and adolescents has
become a major public health concern worldwide. While
more studies now follow the WHO's recommendation6 to
de®ne overweight in adolescents, no study has addressed the
feasibility of the WHO's recommendation of conditioning
the assessment on maturation status to account for popula-
tion differences in maturation rates. With three large sam-
ples from nationwide surveys in China, Russia and the US,
our results show that using the WHO BMI reference without
considering maturation difference, overweight prevalence is
underestimated in populations where adolescents mature

mature earlier. In general, the effects of the adjustment vary
by the magnitude of the difference in maturation between
the reference and study populations as well as the degree of
obesity of the study population. The adjustment increased
the estimate of overweight prevalence from 3.5% to 4.9% in
the China sample, from 8.3% to 9.7% in Russia, while it
decreased it from 29.2% to 28.0% in the NHANES III sample.
Although the absolute differences between adjusted and
unadjusted prevalence rates are small, they can be important
when considering the health burden of overweight. A differ-
ence of 1.5 percentage points in an overweight prevalence
estimate may mean that a large number of individuals are
misclassi®ed by the unadjusted method. For example, if we
assume the rate could be applied to all adolescents, this
means that 3.26 million adolescents in China, 0.34 million
in Russia, and 0.55 million in the US are likely to be
misclassi®ed.42
We used population level maturation information (based
on MAM) to adjust overweight prevalence estimates, since
menarche is the maturity measure most likely to be available
from population studies of nutritional status. Menarcheal
status can be reliably reported by individuals, and the status
quo method can be easily applied to estimate MAM.
Menarcheal status data are easier and cheaper to obtain
than maturity measures such as breast stage or skeletal age
that rely on a physical examination. When menarcheal data
cannot be collected, the MAM from comparable samples can
be used in the adjustment. This is an important strength of
the population method, especially in many developing
countries.
We found a much greater impact of the adjustment
among young adolescents (10 ± 13 y) than among older ado-
lescents (14 ± 18 y). Since more young adolescents are likely
to be misclassi®ed, greater efforts should be made to consider
their maturation status. There is likely to be an age at which
maturation adjustment should no longer be done, but this
may differ across populations. Greater variation in matura-
tional status is likely among younger girls, but by age 16 the
vast majority of girls in most populations will be post-
menarcheal and fully mature. Among older, late maturing
girls, the maturity adjustment is unlikely to have an effect on
overweight prevalence estimates, since later maturing girls
tend to be taller and lighter than early maturing girls.
Furthermore, the rate of change in BMI decreases with age,
so that the BMI 85th percentile cut-offs are more similar

aThese comparisons were only conducted in girls aged 10 ± 16 y who had completed data on reported age at menarche
and breast stages. The individual-adjustment in premenarcheal girls could only be performed for those who were at
breast stage 2 or over. Therefore, the total number of girls in this table is smaller than the original whole sample
(n  2014).
bUn-adjusted prevalence was calculated using CA-matched BMI cut-offs.
cAdjusted prevalence with the population-adjustment was estimated by using MA-matched BMI cut-offs, and
MA  CA  0.3.
dAdjusted prevalence was estimated by using MA2-matched BMI cut-offs, and MA2  CA  (12.8 7 (AAM  0.5)).
eAdjusted prevalence was estimated by using MA2-matched BMI cut-offs, and MA2 were calculated based on individuals'
current age, breast stage and the difference in maturation between the study and reference populations (ie 0.3).
fSince only seven premenarcheal girls were over 14 y old, the prevalence was not presented.

across age for older adolescents. For example, the cut-offs
increase by about 1 unit per year before age 14 y, but only by
about 0.5 unit thereafter.6
Despite its practicality and feasibility, the population
method for maturity adjustment of overweight prevalence
has some limitations. The method is based on the assump-
tion that the entire population under study is shifted in its
maturational timing. A comparison of the distribution of
maturation events in US NHANES I and III girls supports this
assumption, but there is a large variation within every
population, and thus some individuals or subgroups may
be misclassi®ed. For example, the population method is
likely to over-adjust early maturing individuals but under-
adjust late maturers in a population where maturation is
delayed relative to the reference population. However, if
these two types of misclassi®cation happen randomly, the
overall prevalence estimate may not be biased.
It is desirable to have a `gold standard' of adolescent
overweight to validate this method and to test the concerns
addressed above. However, such a standard is not available.
Therefore, we compared population- and individual-based
adjustment in American girls as a means to evaluate the
population method. The individual-based adjustment may
be better since it utilizes each individual's maturation infor-
mation (age at menarche and breast stage) more ef®ciently.
In general, our results suggest a good agreement between the
population and individual assessments, although the popu-
lation-method is more conservative in postmenarcheal girls.
Assuming the individual-based adjustment is a `gold stan-
dard', the sensitivity and speci®city of the population-based
method is quite high. Nevertheless, the individual adjust-
ment has several weaknesses. For post-menarcheal girls, age
at menarche was only reported in whole years of age.
Further, reported age at menarche may also suffer from
recall bias. In premenarcheal girls, our breast-stage adjusted
maturation age may not be an ideal indicator of an indivi-
dual's `real' maturation age, since breast stages have no clear
boundaries and each stage lasts several months to b 1 y. In
addition, it may be more dif®cult to identify breast stages in
obese and non-white girls.18 Well designed studies with
better measures of adolescent overweight and maturation
are desirable to validate the proposed method for maturity
adjustment.
In conclusion, our study shows that maturation adjust-
ment can make a difference when using the WHO reference
to measure adolescent overweight. This suggests that differ-
ences across groups and populations should be considered
when measuring child and adolescent overweight and obe-
sity. Currently there is a tendency to uncritically use (or
recommend) BMI cut-offs for de®ning overweight and obe-
sity without fully recognizing their limitations and potential
for misclassi®cation. Based on biological and epidemiologi-
cal considerations, maturational timing should be taken into
account when making international comparisons of over-
weight prevalence. This is especially true when the study
populations differ markedly in maturation rates. Ideally, we
would like to have an international reference that can be
easily conditioned on maturation status, but such a reference
is not likely to be available in the near future. Maturity
adjustment using the population method is feasible and
will produce less biased estimates of overweight prevalence,
and thus a better basis for international comparisons.
