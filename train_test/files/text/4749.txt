Abstract
Objectives: To determine whether the associations with key risk factors in patients with
diagnosed and undiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are different using data from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2010.
Methods: The study analysed the prevalence and association with risk factors of undiagnosed and
diagnosed T2DM using a regression model and a multinomial logistic regression model. Data from
the NHANES 1999­2010 were used for the analyses.
Results: The study analysed data from 10 570 individuals. The overall prevalence of diagnosed and
undiagnosed T2DM increased significantly from 1999 to 2010. The prevalence of undiagnosed
T2DM was significantly higher in non-Hispanic whites, in individuals <30 years old and in those
with near optimal (130­159 mg/dl) or very high (220 mg/dl) non-high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels compared with diagnosed T2DM. Body mass index, low economic status or low
educational level had no effect on T2DM diagnosis rates. Though diagnosed T2DM was associated
with favourable diet/carbohydrate intake behavioural changes, it had no effect on physical activity
levels.

Introduction
In recent decades, the prevalence of type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has dramatically
increased in the USA and worldwide.1­3
Among individuals with T2DM, undiag-
nosed diabetes, which is shown to be
associated with a body mass index (BMI)
value 35 kg/m2, is highly prevalent world-
wide and is more likely to be associated with
severe diabetic complications.4 Another
study noted that in the USA adolescent
population, T2DM accounted for approxi-
mately half of adolescent diabetes and one-
third of these cases were undiagnosed.5 The
economic costs associated with undiagnosed
diabetes in the USA increased by 83% from
2007 to 2012, whereas the economic costs of
diagnosed diabetes increased by 41% from
2007 to 2012.6 During the period of undiag-
nosed diabetes, risks for micro- and macro-
vascular complications are elevated and it
has been proposed that treating hypergly-
caemia to prevent complications is more
effective than treating these complications
after they have developed.7
In other countries during the last decade,
the percentage of patients with undiagnosed
T2DM among all T2DM patients were
reported to be 30% in Iran,8 50% in
Germany9 and about 75% in China.10
According to the sixth edition of the
Diabetes Atlas of International Diabetes
Federation (2013), in some developing
regions such as South-East Asia, Western
Pacific, and Africa, the proportion of people
with undiagnosed T2DM was equal to or
greater than the population of patients
diagnosed with T2DM.11
Risk factors for developing T2DM,
including obesity and a sedentary lifestyle,
play important roles in escalating the preva-
lence of diabetes.12­14 In addition, behav-
ioural and environmental factors have to be
taken into consideration.15,16 In particular,
obesity at a young age is an important risk
factor for T2DM.17,18 Increased physical
activity is associated with a reduced risk of
diabetes in both men and women and even
moderate activity is protective against
T2DM.19,20 Metabolic syndrome, a known
precursor of T2DM, is characterized by
insulin resistance and includes other meta-
bolic abnormalities such as hypertension,
hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceri-
daemia.21­23 The prevalence of metabolic
syndrome has increased particularly in
developing countries, perhaps as a result of
the adoption of a Western diet (more pro-
cessed foods), particularly in Asia.24
Although many risk factors for T2DM,
such as BMI values 25 kg/m2, have been
investigated in the past, previous studies
have not examined whether undiagnosed
T2DM is correlated with other specifically
identified risk factors and whether undiag-
nosed T2DM patients might be distin-
guished from diagnosed T2DM patients by
these risk factors.
The objectives of the present study were
to determine whether the associations with
key risk factors in patients with diagnosed
and undiagnosed T2DM are different, and
to analyse the prevalence of diagnosed and

undiagnosed T2DM in groups defined by
demographic characteristics and risk fac-
tors. Analysis of the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
data from 1999 to 2010 should help to better
describe the clinical profile of undiagnosed
T2DM patients, which may serve as guid-
ance for improving T2DM diagnosis in
China.
Patients and methods
Study population
The NHANES is a cross-sectional health
survey representing the noninstitutionalized
USA population. NHANES was carried out
by the National Center for Health Statistics,
which is a branch of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. A complex, multi-
stage, probability sampling strategy was
used for data collection and subgroups of
particular public interest were intensively
sampled.25 The study was approved by the
National Center for Health Statistics
Institutional Ethics Review Board and all
adult participants provided written
informed consent. In the current study,
NHANES data were obtained from individ-
uals interviewed between 1999 and 2010,
which included men, and non-pregnant and
non-lactating women (age range, 30­79
years). Participants answered questionnaires
on demographics, lifestyle and medical fac-
tors. NHANES also obtained anthropomet-
ric measurements and biomarker data at
mobile examination centres. This present
study did not focus on adolescents and
young adults because a young age of onset
is a hallmark of type 1 diabetes.26
Participants with missing exposure out-
comes and covariate information were
excluded from the study.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus status
Type 2 diabetes mellitus status (normogly-
caemic, diagnosed diabetes, undiagnosed
diabetes) was defined based on the fasting
plasma glucose concentration, glycosylated
haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, and question-
naires. Diagnosed diabetes was defined by
positive responses to one or more questions
such as: ``Have you ever been told by a
doctor that you have diabetes?'' and ``Are
you now taking diabetic pills to lower your
blood sugar?''. Undiagnosed diabetes was
defined by negative responses to the ques-
tions above and a fasting glucose concen-
tration 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) or HbA1c
6.5%. Normoglycaemia was defined
as fasting glucose <126 mg/dl and HbA1c
<6.5% and no positive responses to the
questionnaire.27
Risk factors
Hypertension was defined as a mean dia-
stolic blood pressure 90 mmHg or a mean
systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg or a
positive response to the questions: ``Have
you been told on two or more different visits
that you had hypertension?'' or ``Are you
taking prescribed medicine to lower blood
pressure''. Prehypertension was defined as a
mean diastolic blood pressure between 80
and 89 mmHg or a mean systolic blood
pressure between 120 and 139 mmHg.27,28
Physical activity was defined as the number
of hours a subject spent on vigorous or
moderate physical activity in a typical
week.29 Participants who claimed they car-
ried out moderate or vigorous activity
>120 h/week were considered implausible
and excluded from the analysis.
Hypercholesterolaemia was defined as a
non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(non-HDL-C) level 130 mg/dl.27 The
levels of non-HDL-C were classified as
follows based on the treatment goals rec-
ommended by the Adult Treatment Panel
III final report: optimal <130 mg/dl; near
optimal/above optimal 130­159 mg/dl; bor-
derline high 160­189 mg/dl; high 190­
219 mg/dl; and very high 220 mg/dl.30
596 Journal of International Medical Research 45(2)
Obesity categories were defined as follows:
underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2); healthy
(BMI 18.5­24.9 kg/m2); overweight (BMI
25.0­29.9 kg/m2); and obese (BMI 
30.0 kg/m2). Hypertriglyceridaemia was
defined as triglyceride 150 mg/dl.
Nutritional data were collected from 24-h
dietary recall and were linked to a database
of the nutrient composition of food for
energy intake calculation. Energy intake
was classified into four quartiles: first
quartile (<1451.0 kcal); second quartile
(1451.0­1912.9 kcal); third quartile
(1913.0­2509.5 kcal); and fourth quartile
(2509.6 kcal). Carbohydrate intake was
classified into four quartiles and the cut-off
values were: first quartile (<175.0 g); second
quartile (175.0­234.5 g); third quartile
(234.6­310.0 g); and fourth quartile
(310.1 g). The cut-off values for categoriz-
ing physical activity into four quartiles were:
first quartile (<0.23 h); second quartile
(0.23­2.99 h); third quartile (3.00­8.99 h);
and fourth quartile (9.00 h).
Covariates
Race/ethnicity was determined by self-
reported demographic questionnaires and
categorized as `Mexican American', `Other
Hispanic', `Non-Hispanic White', `Non-
Hispanic Black', and `other Race ­ including
Multi-Racial'. Marital Status was categor-
ized as `Married', `Widowed', `Divorced',
`Separated', `Never married', and `Living
with partner'. Family income-to-poverty
ratio was determined by the family income
and The Department of Health and Human
Services' poverty guidelines. The cut-off
values for the four quartiles of family
income-to-poverty ratio were: first quartile
(<1.20); second quartile (1.20­2.27); third
quartile (2.28­4.20); and fourth quartile
(4.21). Education levels were determined
by questions: `What is highest degree or level
of school completed or the highest degree
received?' and categorized into `Less than
9th grade', `9­11th grade (includes 12th
grade with no diploma), `high school gradu-
ation/General Educational Development or
equivalent', `some college or Associate of
Arts degree', and `college graduate or
above'.
Insurance status was determined by
responses to whether the participant was
`covered by health insurance or some other
kind of health care plan, including health
insurance obtained through employment or
purchased directly, as well as government
programmes like Medicare and Medicaid
that provide medical care or help to pay for
medical bills.
Statistical analyses
The prevalence of diagnosed or undiagnosed
diabetes was established using SAS software
version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA)
to estimate percentage and 95% confidence
intervals. The standard error was estimated
by a Taylor series (linearization) method
based on a complex sampling design. The
Rao-Scott 2-test was a design-adjusted
version of the Pearson 2-test, which was
used for equality of prevalence for categor-
ical variables. The two samples t-test was
used in the PROC SURVEYREG (SAS
Institute) to test for equality of continuous
variables and two-proportion Z-tests were
used to test proportions between diagnosed
and undiagnosed diabetes groups. The
PROC SURVEYREG described by
NHANES tutorials, examined the age-
adjusted prevalence of diagnosed and
undiagnosed T2DM from 1999 to 2010,
with the 2000 Census serving as the standard
population. Linear trends of age-adjusted
prevalence were assessed by regression
models, with a 2-year survey cycle treated
as a continuous variable. A P-value <0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Multinomial logistic regression was con-
ducted using SAS software version 9.3
PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC (SAS Institute)
Zhang et al. 597
for each variable to assess the association
between risk factors and diagnosed or
undiagnosed diabetes. Model 1 was a logis-
tic regression model to assess the association
between diabetes status as a dependent
variable and each risk factor as an inde-
pendent variable. Model 2 was based on
model 1 and adjusted according to socio-
demographic variables including age,
gender, race/ethnicity, education level,
family income-to-poverty ratio, marital
status, and insurance status. Model 3 was a
multivariable logistic regression analysis of
all variables from model 2 and adjusted for
other risk factor variables including hyper-
tension, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertrigly-
ceridaemia, physical activity, carbohydrate
intake and energy intake.
Results
This study included a cohort of adults from
six NHANES 2-year survey cycles (1999­
2010) consisting of 10 570 participants with
clinical, demographic and laboratory data,
which were divided into diagnosed diabetes,
undiagnosed diabetes and normoglycaemic
groups (Table 1). During the 12 years,
participants with undiagnosed diabetes
were significantly more likely to be male
without insurance and have a higher carbo-
hydrate and energy intake than those diag-
nosed with diabetes (P < 0.05 for all
comparisons). Mean age, BMI, and the
prevalence of hypertension, hypercholester-
olaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia were
similar between the diagnosed and undiag-
nosed groups (Table 1). Furthermore, the
proportion of patients <30 years old was
significantly higher in the undiagnosed than
in the diagnosed diabetes group (P ¼ 0.0032)
(Table 2). Non-Hispanic white people
comprised a significantly larger proportion
of the undiagnosed diabetes group com-
pared with the diagnosed diabetes group
(P ¼ 0.0015). Compared with diagnosed
T2DM patients, individuals with
undiagnosed T2DM were significantly
more likely to have near optimal (130­
159 mg/dl) or very high (220 mg/dl) non-
HDL-C serum concentrations (P < 0.05 for
both comparisons). A significantly higher
proportion of diagnosed T2DM patients
were in the first quartile and a significantly
lower proportion were in the fourth quartile
of energy and carbohydrate intakes com-
pared with undiagnosed patients (P < 0.05
for all comparisons).
The overall age-adjusted prevalence for
diagnosed diabetes and undiagnosed dia-
betes increased significantly from 4.96% and
3.45% in 1999 to 7.78% (P ¼ 0.008) and
4.36% (P ¼ 0.041) in 2010, respectively
(Figure 1a). As expected, the prevalence of
diagnosed diabetes was higher than undiag-
nosed diabetes in the total population and in
the subgroups defined by risk factors
(Figures 1a and 1b). The prevalence of
diagnosed diabetes in non-Hispanic white
and non-Hispanic blacks increased signifi-
cantly during the 12 years (P ¼ 0.046 and
P ¼ 0.017, respectively) and nearly doubled
in 2009­2010 compared with 1999­2000.
However, the increasing trend was not sig-
nificant for undiagnosed diabetes in all race/
ethnicity groups.
Among gender subgroups, females had a
slightly lower prevalence than males for
both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes
in most years between 1999 and 2010
(Figure 1a). Neither diagnosed diabetes
nor undiagnosed diabetes in gender sub-
groups exhibited significantly increasing
trends. Both diagnosed diabetes and
undiagnosed diabetes in participants with
hypertension showed a significant increasing
prevalence (P ¼ 0.009 and P ¼ 0.004,
respectively) between 1999 and 2010
(Figure 1b). But the prevalence of diagnosed
or undiagnosed diabetes did not change
significantly over time for participants with-
out hypertension. Similarly, participants
with hypercholesterolaemia also displayed
a significantly increasing prevalence for both

(P ¼ 0.040 and P ¼ 0.030, respectively),
whereas hypertriglyceridaemia had no
effect on participants with undiagnosed dia-
betes. The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes
increased over the years in obese individuals
and those covered by insurance (P ¼ 0.018
and P ¼ 0.010, respectively), but these fac-
tors did not influence changes in the preva-
lence of undiagnosed diabetes (Figure 1b).
Hypertension was associated with an
increased risk of both diagnosed and
undiagnosed diabetes (odd ratios [ORs]
and 95% confidence interval [CI] were 4.98

graphic and other risk factors, the ORs were
somewhat attenuated (OR 1.69, 95% CI

betes; and OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.31, 2.64,

statistically significant after sociodemo-
graphic and other factors were adjusted in
the models (Table 3 and Table 4, models 2
and 3).
Compared with subjects with the lowest
physical activity quartile 1 (Q1, reference),
the ORs of having diagnosed diabetes and
undiagnosed diabetes decreased in partici-
pants who underwent more physical activity
(Q4 ORs and 95% CIs were 0.36 [0.28, 0.47],
P < 0.0001 for diagnosed diabetes; and 0.49
[0.36, 0.68], P < 0.0001 for undiagnosed
diabetes) (Table 3 and Table 4, model 1).
After adjustment for sociodemographic fac-
tors, only the Q4 of physical activity was
associated with diagnosed diabetes (OR and
95% CI 0.57 [0.38, 0.87], P ¼ 0.0096) and the
association was not significant in undiag-
nosed diabetes (OR and 95% CI 0.69 [0.42,
1.13]) (Table 3 and Table 4, model 2).
Subjects with a higher quartile of carbo-
hydrate intake showed greater differences
between diagnosed diabetes and undiag-
nosed diabetes. For example, the ORs of
having diagnosed diabetes and undiagnosed
diabetes were 0.65 and 0.64 respectively in
Q2, but the ORs were 0.21 (95% CI 0.09,
0.48, P ¼ 0.0002) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.41,

Discussion
The proportion of undiagnosed diabetes
remains high despite enhanced surveillance
programmes, in particular national health
programmes in the US,31­34 which may in
part be due to a lack of health-related
quality of life deficits,35 at least in the initial
stages of undiagnosed diabetes. However,
a recent study reported a prevalence of
32.55% of microvascular complications in
asymptomatic newly diagnosed T2DM
patients.36 In an earlier study undertaken
in 300 newly diagnosed T2DM patients,
38.6% had coronary heart disease and
17.7% had silent myocardial infarctions;
with microvascular complications already
present (neuropathy [27.5%], nephropathy
[20.2%] and retinopathy [17.9%]), which
had presumably developed during the
asymptomatic preclinical phase of the dis-
ease.37 Another study showed that among
1917 non-demented men and women, those
with undiagnosed diabetes had the lowest
cognitive performance.38 In order to develop
policies and strategies for improving the
detection of T2DM, particularly in develop-
ing countries, noninvasive risk models

betes mainly based on age, BMI, waist

circumference and hypertension have been
developed.39 A previous study noted that
diabetes diagnosis in the US varied consid-
erably between individuals with different
BMIs.4 In individuals with BMIs  35 kg/
m2, diagnosed diabetes increased markedly
from 4.9% in 1960 to 8.6% during 1976­
1980 and 15.1% in 1999­2000, whereas
undiagnosed diabetes decreased from
12.5% during 1976­1980 to 3.2% in 1999­
2000 in the same group.4 In contrast,
changes in prevalence within the BMI
strata 35 kg/m2 were modest and there
was no increase in the percentage of total
cases that were diagnosed.4 The findings of
the current study were similar since BMI
and obesity were not associated with the
prevalence of undiagnosed T2DM, which
might reflect increased awareness rates
amongst obese people (Table 2). However,
BMI as a risk factor for developing T2DM
has been shown to vary between ethnic
groups40 and the BMI threshold for T2DM
screening of American Asians has been
modified to 23 kg/m2 by the American
Diabetes Association.41 Although the per-
centage of individuals covered by insurance
was significantly lower in undiagnosed
versus diagnosed T2DM patients in the
present study, the family income-to-poverty
ratio and educational status unexpectedly
did not have any influence on whether
T2DM was diagnosed or not, indicating
that public health measures were effective
for poorer people and those with lower
levels of education.42
Non-Hispanic white people were the
majority of the surveyed population and
the only ethnic group with a significantly
higher undiagnosed prevalence of T2DM.
Although the prevalence of undiagnosed
T2DM was lower in non-Hispanic whites
compared with other ethnic groups
(Figure 1a), the predominant proportion of
non-Hispanic whites in the total undiag-
nosed T2DM population implies that this
population deserves to be the major target
for addressing T2DM unawareness. Low
HDL-C levels have been noted to contribute
to the pathophysiology of T2DM,43,44 and a
larger proportion of individuals with very
high (220 mg/dl) non-HDL-C had undiag-
nosed diabetes, which might reflect a
lack of hypercholesterolaemia awareness.
Unexpectedly, the rate was also higher in
people with non-HDL-C levels of 130­
159 mg/dl, which might have been a factor
for not expecting a diagnosis of T2DM and
thereby a reason for undiagnosed diabetes.
In addition, compared with individuals with
diagnosed diabetes, those individuals with
undiagnosed diabetes comprised a larger
proportion of the <30 years age group,
indicating that younger people may care
less about their health and therefore have a
higher level of T2DM unawareness.
Several studies have reported that a high
carbohydrate intake is associated with a risk
of developing diabetes,45­47 findings consist-
ent with the results of the present study. In a
fully adjusted model (model 3), carbohy-
drate intake was associated with diagnosed
diabetes but not with undiagnosed diabetes
(Table 3 and Table 4), and carbohydrate and
energy uptake was lower in diagnosed
patients (Table 2), indicating effective diet-
ary lifestyle intervention in diagnosed
T2DM patients.12 In contrast, awareness
of T2DM did not significantly drive physical
activity changes among patients in different
physical activity quartiles, which may imply
that unlike dietary intake, T2DM awareness
is not a determining factor for physical
activity behaviour change. Among the
cardio-metabolic factors, hypertension,
hypertriglyceridaemia and obesity were
strongly associated with both diagnosed
and undiagnosed diabetes, although hyper-
cholesterolaemia did not reach statistical
significance after adjusting for covariates
and confounders (Table 3 and Table 4).
Physical activity displayed an inverse asso-
ciation with diabetes in the three models
used in this present study, especially in
Zhang et al. 605
model 1, findings that were consistent with
those of other research.48
The present research had several limita-
tions. First, it was a cross-sectional survey
study and directional cause­effect relation-
ships between risk factors and diabetes risk
cannot be inferred. Secondly, there were
issues with dietary intake recall, since par-
ticipants may have under-reported their
food intake or changed their usual dietary
pattern because they participated in the
survey.49 Thirdly, due to a change of the
measuring method, some variables may dis-
play slight differences. It is also important to
note that the prevalence, trends and possibly
patient characteristics of undiagnosed
T2DM patients in developing countries
such as China may be distinct from those
in the US. Thus, country-specific epidemio-
logical studies need to be carried out to
address the unmet T2DM unawareness, since
the rate of undiagnosed diabetes is consider-
ably higher in China then in the US.10
In conclusion, this present study investi-
gated the differences in the prevalence rates
of diagnosed and undiagnosed T2DM and
the associations with risk factors using data
from NHANES from 1999 to 2010. The
overall prevalence rates of diagnosed and
undiagnosed T2DM increased significantly
from 1999 to 2010 and were associated with
hypertension, hypertriglyceridaemia, obes-
ity and hypercholesterolaemia. Subgroup
analyses revealed increasing rates of hyper-
tension, hypercholesterolaemia, obesity,
hypertriglyceridaemia, and insurance cover-
age in diagnosed patients and increasing
rates of hypertension and hypercholesterol-
aemia in undiagnosed T2DM patients from
1999 to 2010. The rate of undiagnosed
T2DM was higher in males, in those
younger than 30 years of age, non-
Hispanic whites or those with very high
non-HDL-C levels (220 mg/dl). It was also
higher in individuals with near optimal non-
HDL-C levels of 130­159 mg/dl, as well as in
patients without health insurance compared
with patients diagnosed with T2DM. Since
the rate of undiagnosed T2DM was high
particularly in people that are considered to
be at a low risk of developing T2DM, a
Chinese approach for diabetes screening
should involve general population surveil-
lance, which is covered by public health
insurance.
