Data obtained in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), conducted
during 1988­1994, were analyzed to determine the epidemiology of rubella seropositivity in the United States,
including risk factors for low rubella seropositivity. Serological samples obtained from NHANES III study
participants 6 years of age were tested for rubella IgG antibodies. "Rubella seropositivity" was defined as
serum rubella IgG antibody level 10 IU by enzyme immunoassay. Overall, rubella seropositivity rates in the
United States were 92% in persons aged 6­11 years, 83% in persons aged 12­19 years, 85% in persons aged
20­29 years, 89% in persons aged 30­39 years, and 93% in persons aged 40 years. The lowest rate (78%)
of any United States birth cohort of the 20th century occurred among persons born from 1970­1974. Elim-
inating rubella and chronic rubella syndrome in the United States will require international efforts, including
vaccination of preschool- and school-age children and all susceptible young adults.
From 1963 to 1967, the median age of patients with
reported cases of rubella in the United States was 5­9
years [1]. During the last national epidemic of rubella,
the number of reported cases reached a record high of
448,796 in 1964 [2], followed by the birth of 120,000
infants with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in
1965­1966 [3]. After licensure of the rubella vaccine in

1969, the number of reported rubella cases plummeted
by 99%--from 56,552 cases in 1970, to 630 cases in
1985 [4, 5] and to an average of 183 cases per year in
1994­1996 [6] (figure 1). Although the number of states
mandating rubella vaccination for school entry rose
from 11 in 1970 to 34 in 1975 and then to all 50 states
by 1979, such laws were not enforced immediately [7].
Rubella vaccination coverage rates for children aged 1­4
years rose from 37% in 1970 to just 59% in 1985 [8].
It was not until 1997 that 91% of children 19­35
months of age received a vaccine that included rubella
[9] (figure 1).
The US Public Health Service has set a goal of elim-
inating indigenous rubella and CRS in the United States
by the year 2010 [10]. Eliminating rubella in women
of childbearing age is necessary to eliminate CRS, a
preventable cause of birth defects. To determine the re-
cent epidemiology of rubella immunity in the United
States and to better target rubella immunization efforts,
we analyzed rubella seropositivity data obtained in the
third National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES III), conducted during 1988­1994.

METHODS
NHANES III is a cross-sectional national survey conducted by
the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [11] to provide na-
tionally representative statistics on a variety of health measures
and conditions [11]. NHANES III was based on a complex,
stratified, multistage, probability-cluster design from which a
representative sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized
United States population was drawn. In NHANES III, children
5 years of age, persons 60 years of age, Mexican Americans,
and non-Hispanic blacks were sampled at a higher rate than
other persons. Participants or their parents or guardians were
interviewed. Participants provided blood samples, which were
tested without personal identifiers. Serum rubella IgG antibody
titers were measured on surplus serum samples available for
persons 6 years old.
Interview questions addressed the study participant's demo-
graphic characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, sex, year
and place of birth, place of residence, income, birthplace of
participant's head of household, household crowding, the abil-
ity to identify a regular clinic or physician, United States mil-
itary service, marital and employment history, and parity and
gravidity for women. A history of rubella vaccination or disease
was not obtained. For this analysis, race/ethnicity was defined
by self-report as "non-Hispanic white," "non-Hispanic black,"
and "Mexican American." Persons who did not select one of
these 3 groups were classified as "other" and analyzed only with
the total population. Detailed descriptions of the sampling and
survey design have been previously published [11].
We received state-specific data on rubella vaccination re-
quirements for school entry by year during the years 1970­1977
and 1979­1980 from the National Immunization Program,
CDC. For persons aged 6­19 years, a variable was created des-
ignating whether rubella vaccination was required for school
entry, under the assumption that the person entered school at
5 years of age in the same state in which he or she was born.
Laboratory methods. Serum samples were tested for rubella
IgG antibody by indirect EIA (California State Department of
Health Services, Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory, Berke-
ley, CA) [12]. The absorbance of the rubella viral antigen (VA)
well minus the absorbance of the uninfected cell as nonspecific
(NS) control antigen well was used to calculate a VANSp
rubella virus (RV) value. To determine the international unit
(IU) value, a regression analysis was done and a standard curve
was calculated using the RV values for the 10 IU, 40 IU, and
100 IU rubella standards and their squares. Positive rubella con-
trol standards consisted of World Health Organization or CDC
standard 1000-IU serum samples, diluted to titers of 10, 40, and
100 IU. Rubella seropositivity for NHANES III was defined as a
serum rubella IgG titer of 10 IU by EIA.
Statistical analysis. All estimates were weighted to rep-
resent the total United States population and to account for
oversampling and nonresponse to the household interview and
physical examination [13, 14]. Prevalence estimates and SEs
were calculated with Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) for mul-
tistage sample designs [15]. Exact 95% CIs were calculated for
the prevalence estimates by the method of Collett [16]. Uni-
variate and multivariate analyses were stratified by age (subjects
aged 6­19 years and 20­49 years) because several important
predictor variables were applicable only to the adult population
(e.g., marital status, occupation, education, military history,and
pregnancy and childbirth history for women). We limited our
adult analysis to those aged 20­49 years, because for persons
aged 50 years, rubella seropositivity was stable at 190%. To
screen for possible predictors of rubella seropositivity, differ-
ences in seroprevalence were evaluated without correction for
multiple comparisons by means of a univariate t statistic from
a general linear contrast procedure in SUDAAN. Variablesdem-
onstrating a univariate association with rubella seropositivity
at were included in the multivariate analysis. Indepen-

logistic regression. Variables with a Satterthwaite-adjusted F

RESULTS
Age-adjusted rubella seropositivity for persons in the United
States aged 6 years was 89.4% (95% CI, 88.5%­90.3%). Ru-
bella seropositivity was higher for non-Hispanic blacks (92.3%;
95% CI, 91.4%­93.2%) than for both non-Hispanic whites
(88.8%; 95% CI, 87.8%­89.8%) and Mexican Americans
(88.5%; 95% CI, 87.7%­89.3%; ). Rubella seropositivity
P ! .05
was lowest for young persons of reproductive-age (12­19 years
and 20­29 years) for all 3 race/ethnicities (table 1).
Rubella seropositivity varied by birth cohort and age (figure
2). Seropositivity was highest (93.2%) for those born from 1901
through 1958, dropped to 87.5% for those born from 1959
through 1964, dropped further to 80.8% for those born from
1965 through 1977, and then rose to 91.4% for those born
from 1978 through 1983. Differences in rubella seropositivity
by birth cohort were all statistically significant ( ) except
P ! .05
for the difference between the oldest and the youngest cohorts
(1901­1958 vs. 1978­1983; figure 2). Within the birth cohort
with the lowest rubella seropositivity, 1965­1977, a subgroup
of persons had an even lower rubella seropositivity (78.8%);
these persons were born during 1970­1974 and were 14­24
years of age during the NHANES III study.
Among persons aged 6­19 years, higher rubella seropositivity
was observed in those who were younger (6­11 years of age),
were non-Hispanic black, had a metropolitan residence, lived
in poverty, and had a non­United States birthplace for both
the participant and the head of household (table 2). The sig-
nificance of these last 2 variables is primarily due to Mexican
Americans, because the number of non-Hispanic whites and
non-Hispanic blacks born outside the United States or with a
head of household who was not born in the United States was
quite small. Mexican Americans aged 6­19 years who were not
born in the United States had higher seropositivity than did
Mexican Americans who were born in the United States (91.2%
vs. 83.6%; ).
P ! .05
Multivariate logistic modeling among persons 6­19 years of
age revealed that younger children (6­11 years of age) were
more likely to be rubella-seropositive than were older children
and adolescents (12­19 years of age; OR, 2.65; 95% CI,
1.85­3.78; table 3). Non-Hispanic blacks were also more likely
than non-Hispanic whites to be rubella-seropositive (OR, 1.96;
95% CI, 1.49­2.58; table 3). In contrast, Mexican Americans
were less likely than non-Hispanic whites to be rubella-sero-
positive (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54­0.95; table 3). Among persons
aged 6­19 years, those born outside the United States were 12.5

Similarly, those with heads of households who were not born
in the United States were more likely to be rubella seropositive
than were those with heads of households who were born in
the United States (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.14­2.65; table 3).
For those 20­49 years of age (table 4), higher seropositivity
was associated with the participant's ability to identify a regular
clinic and physician, history of military service, marital history,
history of employment in a medical occupation, and parity and
gravidity among women. Among Mexican Americans who were
20­29 years of age, higher rubella seropositivity was found for
those who were not born in the United States, compared with
who were born in the United States (744 [86.4%] vs. 513
[78.6%]; ).

For women aged 20­49 years, who were ever married, those
who had given birth had higher rubella seropositivity than did
those who had not, 714 (93.8%) versus 629 (81.3%; ).

However, a history of 1 pregnancy that did not result in a live
birth did not increase rubella seropositivity among women who
were never married (82.5%; table 4). For women aged 20­49
years who were never married, rubella seropositivity did not
vary by pregnancy history or parity.
For persons aged 20­49 years, multivariate logistic modeling
showed that the likelihood of rubella seropositivity was higher
among those aged 30­39 years, non-Hispanic blacks, those ever
married, and those with a history of United States military
service (table 5). Those who could identify a regular clinic and
health care provider had higher rubella seropositivity (OR, 1.29;

parity and gravidity among women aged 20­49 years, we found
similar associations with age, non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity,
child care occupation, and marital status. Pregnancy and birth
history were not better predictors of seropositivity than was
marital status and were eventually eliminated from the model.

positivity among persons aged 20­49 years revealed a significant

interaction between age and sex. After stratifying for sex and
adjusting for all relevant cofactors (e.g., age, ethnicity, child
care occupation, health care access, military service, and marital
status), we found that older men aged 40­49 years were nearly
3 times more likely than younger men aged 20­29 years to be
rubella-seropositive (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.62­5.44; table 5). In
comparison, women aged 30­39 years had significantly higher
rubella seropositivity than did younger women aged 20­29
years (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.07­2.41), but older women aged
40­49 years did not (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.89­1.94; table 5).
DISCUSSION
In our study, the lowest rate of rubella seropositivity in the
United States occurred among persons born during 1965­1977,
an age group who have already entered their years of child-
bearing-age. It is possible that waning vaccine-associated im-
munity was responsible for the decreased rubella seropositivity
rates seen in this group of adolescents and young adults [17,
18]. However, the current RA 27/3 vaccine has been reported
to provide persistent, long-term immunity [19]. It is more likely
that the sharp drop in rubella incidence in the 1970s followed
by the slow rise in rubella vaccination coverage from 1969
through 1998 (figure 1) resulted in a "lost generation" of young
people who missed acquiring rubella antibodies because they
were born too late to be exposed to circulating wild-type rubella
during childhood but born too early to receive mandatory ru-
bella vaccination at school entry. Consequently, the childbear-
ing-age population in the United States contains a birth cohort
(1970­1974) with the lowest rubella seropositivity of any
United States birth cohort in the 20th century (figure 2).
Our data indicate that although tremendous progress has
been made in increasing rubella seropositivity in young chil-
dren, particularly among non-Hispanic blacks and persons liv-
ing in poverty, rubella susceptibility among adolescents and
young adults remains a surprisingly large problem, especially
for Mexican Americans born in the United States, women who
were never married who have not delivered a child, and persons
who are unable to identify a routine clinic or health care pro-
vider. Although the overall United States rubella herd immunity
of 89.4% during 1988­1994 has successfully prevented national
rubella epidemics, it has been unable to prevent occasional
rubella outbreaks [20­22] or births of CRS-affected infants [5,
9]. Consequently, achieving elimination of rubella and CRS will
require maintaining high rubella vaccination coverage of chil-
dren and increasing rubella vaccination coverage of adults of
childbearing-age. In addition, enforcement of state laws re-
quiring a second dose of measles, mumps, rubella vaccine for
schoolchildren, instituted in 1989 to protect those with primary
measles vaccine failure, may also improve rubella seropositivity
in adolescents.

Rubella seropositivity in the United States varies by age, race/
ethnicity, and birthplace. Mexican Americans born outside the
United States have significantly higher rubella seropositivity
than do those born in the United States, probably because those
born outside the United States were infected with rubella in
their native country. In addition, Mexican Americans aged 6­19
years have significantly higher rubella seropositivity when their
heads of households were born outside the United States, com-
pared with those born in the United States (1063 [88.3%] vs.
902 [81.5%]; ). It may be that having a head of house-
P ! .05
hold who was born outside the United States is a surrogate
marker for increased exposure to rubella, possibly via visitors
who import rubella into the United States or through increased
travel outside the United States. Similarly, the significantly
higher rubella seropositivity in non-Hispanic blacks aged 6­19
years and 20­49 years may indicate increased exposure to wild-
type disease in this population as well [23].
Adults aged 20­49 years with a history of medical or military
occupations had significantly higher rubella seropositivity than
did those who did not, indicating the benefit of employer-
Rubella Seropositivity · CID 2001:33 (15 October) · 1285
provided and/or employer-mandated rubella immunization.
Persons aged 20­49 years who had ever worked in child care
had lower rubella seropositivity, a troubling association because
children with rubella or CRS can easily transmit the virus to
pregnant caretakers who are susceptible to rubella. However,
only a relatively small number of child care workers were iden-
tified in this subgroup; therefore, the sample size may not be
adequate to describe this population.
One limitation of this study is the lack of sufficient data to
estimate seroprevalence for other minority groups beyond non-
Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans. Also, the study did
not include participants from United States territories, posses-
sions, or commonwealths, although residents of these areas are
United States citizens and eligible to move anywhere within the
United States. Because no information on rubella vaccination
was collected, the effect of rubella vaccination on rubella se-
ropositivity could not be determined. Specific information on
access to immunization services was not collected; only sur-
rogate variables on whether the person could name a clinic
and/or health care provider were available.
Hinman et al. [24] noted in 1983 that the weakest part of
the United States rubella vaccination strategy was immunizing
those currently at risk of having a pregnancy complicated by
rubella (e.g., women of childbearing age). This remains true
today. Premarital rubella immunization of women may have
raised rubella seropositivity in women of childbearing age be-
cause the rubella seropositivity in married women aged 20­49
years did not vary significantly by pregnancy or childbirth his-
tory. However, premarital immunization policies have probably
become less effective in vaccinating women before childbearing
because an increasing number of births in the United States
are to unmarried women [25]. In 1997, 32% of all infants in
the United States, 22% of non-Hispanic white infants, 69% of
non-Hispanic black infants, and 39% of Mexican American
infants were born to unmarried women [25].
For women aged 20­49 years who were never married, ru-
bella seropositivity did not rise significantly after 1 pregnancy
but rose only after a live birth. Although this suggests that
many reproductive health care providers follow guidelines for
postpartum rubella immunization [26, 27], the delay in im-
munizing some women of childbearing age means that current
vaccination practices will not always protect firstborn or even
secondborn children from CRS, especially when the mother is
unmarried. This is supported by CRS surveillance data acquired
during 1985­1996, which show that 46 (52%) of 87 mothers
of infants with indigenously acquired CRS had at least 1 pre-
vious live birth [28]. Therefore, rubella immunizationprograms
should seek out and immunize rubella-susceptible adolescents
and adult women before their first pregnancy, regardless of
marital status or stated intention to delay childbearing.
Several barriers still remain to improving rubella vaccination
coverage in persons of childbearing age. A major barrier in the
United States is limited access to preventive health care by
rubella-susceptible populations [29, 30]. Because rubella vac-
cination is not mandated and provided for adults as it is for
children (at school entry), targeted and more complicated strat-
egies are needed to ensure that adults of childbearing age are
rubella-immune. Also, some health insurance policies may not
pay for adult vaccinations [31]. A fourth barrier to adult im-
munization is concern about possible adverse events. Although
one center reported a possible association between chronic ar-
thropathy and rubella vaccination in women [32, 33], recent
studies by others have not replicated these findings [34­37].
A fifth barrier is the ignorance of many adults, including
some physicians, of the importance of adult immunizations
[38, 39]. Indeed, physicians may lack adequate training in vac-
cine-preventable diseases [39]. Therefore, formal immunization
training regarding the importance of immunizing both pedi-
atric and adult patients should be incorporated into all primary
care residency training and continuing medical education pro-
grams [39].
Clinicians should use every opportunity to vaccinate ado-
lescents and young adults who lack documentation of rubella
immunity [27]. Eliminating rubella and CRS in the United
States will not occur until national rubella vaccinationprograms
are expanded to include rubella vaccination coverage for
women of childbearing age [21], especially unmarried women
and those born during 1965­1977. As with other vaccine-pre-
ventable diseases, such as measles and polio, close collaboration
with other countries to intensify rubella immunization efforts
will be necessary to entirely eliminate rubella [5, 40].
