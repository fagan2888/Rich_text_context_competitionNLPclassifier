The core of the upper-middle class are college-educated,
employed, married couples with their children. Within this
class there are fractions that live somewhat different lives
from one another. These families make a spectrum with
corporate managers at one end, intellectuals at the other,
and professionals in the middle. Each of these groups has a
distinctive approach to work, which carries over into
differences in how they lives their family lives.
The college class spreads across a spectrum of occupa-
tions. It also produces a middle class layer and an upper-
middle class layer. College-educated men and women tend
to marry one another, and both are likely to have jobs.
Husband and wife each approach their work in line with the
norms of each person's occupation. They also make a
common family out of some combination of the class and
occupational cultures that they join together.
Layers and Fractions of the College Class
There is a solid line of studies of professionals that
distinguishes them from corporate managers and business
executives. Eliot Freidson (1986) emphasizes the historical
process by which professionals established a separate realm
of power from merchants and manufacturers. Steven Brint
(1994) follows Freidson, showing further how control of
knowledge is key to what distinguishes professionals from
other workers within various organizations and markets.
Andrew Abbott (1988) argues that professions compete
with one another, as well as with business managers, to
establish their distinctive jurisdictions within a system of
professions. Keith MacDonald (1995), in his overview of
the sociology of professions, puts the "professionalizing
project" at the core of what sociology knows about
professions in relation to other occupations.
Pierre Bourdieu's work has been most fruitful in thinking
about the culture of different fractions of the same class stratum,
as well as how the higher strata differ from the lower. In
Distinction (1984) Bourdieu says that this high ("dominant")
class has more total capital than the classes below. Internally,
though, the various fractions differ in their mix of economic
capital (money) and cultural capital (knowledge or culture).
The "dominant fraction of the dominant class," the monied
end of this spectrum, consist of commercial and industrial
employers. The "dominated fraction of the dominant class" is
exemplified by public-sector executives, engineers, private-
sector executives below the top level, professions, secondary
teachers, higher-education teachers, and artistic producers.
Michele Lamont has made the most complex attempt to apply
Bourdieu's class fraction idea. In the monied fraction she
looks for the profit-related occupations in the private sector,
both among the salaried and the self-employed. In the cultured
fraction she seeks cultural and social specialists within the
public, nonprofit, and private sectors, and people in what she
calls "profit-related occupations" in the public and non-profit
sectors (Lamont 1992, 2002). Joseph Soares tested cultured
versus monied class fractions in surveys of Yale and Wake
Forest alumni (Soares 2007 on Yale; unpublished data on
Wake Forest). He compared professionals and non-
professionals among those in the top 10% of income in the
two universities, then with a similarly constructed group in the
National Educational Longitudinal Survey.
Previous considerations of professions, or of the fractions of
the college-educated class, tend to compare just two categories,
professionals and managers. Moreover, they tend to place the
college educated in the middle and/or upper-middle class,
without further considering the difference that might make.
The "500 Families" dataset lets us look a little more deeply
into these nuances of class layer and class fraction. We can
compare the middle class and upper-middle class. Moreover,
we can consider not just two ends of the spectrum of class

fractions, but a third position in the middle. Using Bourdieu's
categories, managers and executives are clearly at the
economic capital pole of the capital-composition spectrum,
while intellectuals are at the pole with more culture than
money. Professionals fall in between. Professionals are those
who make a business out of applying knowledge.
The 500 Families dataset is an excellent tool to test whether
managers and intellectuals form a spectrum, with professio-
nals in the middle. Linda Waite and Barbara Schneider
interviewed 500 families with children from eight American
towns. The great majority were married, college-educated,
dual-career couples with a kindergartener, a teenager, or both.
There were some single-mother families, and a few single-
father families, as well. This dataset is rich and nuanced
enough to let us compare an upper-middle class layer with a
middle class layer, with the few lower-middle class people in
the sample included for comparison. Each layer will be
divided into three class fractions, divided thus:
The occupations in each fraction, and the numbers of
individuals in each fraction, are as follows.
Upper-Middle Class Fractions
Management: Executives and Managers (288
individuals)
Professions: Lawyers, Judges, Physicians, Archi-
tects, and Engineers (135)
Intelligentsia: Writers, Artist, Professors, Scientists,
and Social Scientists (95)
Middle Class Fractions
Business Middle: Sales and Public Relations (65)
Paraprofessional: Nurses, Therapists, and Counselors
(36)
Knowledge Middle: Sub-doctoral Scientists, Social
Scientists, Technicians, Teachers, Librarians, and
Religious Workers (133).
Lower-Middle Class Fractions:
Service, Clerical, and Manual Workers (116).
The gender breakdown of each of these categories is as
follows:
The overall study is skewed somewhat toward women,
reflecting the difference between single mothers and single
fathers in the sample. The Management and Intellectual
fractions mirror the overall gender split. The Professions and
Business Middle are significantly more male than the overall
group of respondents, while the Knowledge Middle and
Lower Middle groups are skewed female. The Paraprofes-
sional group of nurses, therapists, and counselors is over-
whelmingly female; there are only two men in this category.
Managers, Professionals, Intellectuals
The 500 Families respondents were asked a series of questions
about why they work. Each question began "How well does
each of the statements below fit your views? I am currently
working in my main job for ...". For each question they were
given the options "Not at all true, Somewhat true, True, and
Very true." Only the percent answering "Very true" are
reported below. I have bolded the top answer for each group.
All tables are significant at the .05 level.

For managers, the clear top motivation for work is "the
money." For intellectuals, by contrast, the overwhelming
top reason for work, chosen by more than half of the
respondents, is "enjoy the task." Indeed, the intellectuals'
preference for the sheer enjoyment of their work is the
strongest motive in the whole table.
Intellectuals have a passion for the specific substance of
their work; managers manage people who produce goods
and services. Intellectuals get their identity from doing and
being the task; managers get their identity from making a
profit or efficiency from any kind of task. Intellectuals get
more intrinsic motivation from the substance of the work;
managers get less intrinsic motivation from the substance of
the work, so they get more extrinsic motivation from the
rewards of the job. Business management and executive
work has to pay more than intellectual work does because
the work itself is less engaging.
Where, then, do we find the professionals? In between the
managers and intellectuals, leaning toward the managers. The
strongest motive for professional work is "the money," chosen
as very true by 40.8%. A close second, though, is "enjoy the
task," chosen by 39.5%. The core fact of the professional class
culture is professionals turn knowledge into profit.
The middle class occupations are heavy on helping
professions--half are nurses, therapists, counselors,
teachers, librarians, or religious workers. Two thirds are
mothers. It is not so surprising, therefore, that they put
"helping people" as their top motivation. This is
especially true of the paraprofessionals, an overwhelm-
ingly female category. The knowledge middle fraction
clearly are devoted to helping people (54.2% very true),
but choose enjoyment of their task a strong second
(47.5%).
The one middle-class category that has more men than
women, the business middle, have the strongest commit-
ment to money as their main motivation for work. The
lower middle class works for the most utilitarian and
extrinsic of reasons--the money, the benefits, and location
close to the kids. 70% of the people in this category are
mothers, many of them single mothers.
The Class Culture of Families
Do parents in different kinds of occupations approach
family life differently?
We can start to see a difference when these working
parents were asked "Do you feel you have had a choice to
stay home and not work for pay in order to raise your
children?"
The men overwhelmingly say no--85% or more among
business, business middle, lower middle, and professional
men. The men of the knowledge work column, though,
stand out as different. 22.2% of knowledge middle men
said yes to this question, and fully 30% of the intellectual
men answered yes as well. Clearly, fathers as a whole very
strongly feel they are supposed to work to support their
families. But the question is a little more flexible for men in
the knowledge jobs.
Women in this study are divided in half on this question
of whether they had a choice to stay home with their
children, with the professional women feeling most driven
to work. Once again, though, the knowledge occupations
stand out as more flexible when it comes to staying home
with the children. It is perhaps not surprising that 69.9% of
the women in the category that includes school teachers
think they have a choice to stay home with their kids--
greater flexibility is one of the reasons that such work has
appealed strongly to women in the first place. It is more
surprising, though, that 3/4ths of the intellectual women
also feel they can stay home with their kids.
There is, of course, a difference between feeling that you
have a choice to stay home with your children, and actually
desiring to. 500 Families asked, therefore, this further
question: "If you were free to do any of the following,
would you prefer to...

238 Soc (2011) 48:236­241
This table is statistically significant. Interestingly, neither
table is significant controlling for sex. I think women like
part-time jobs better in general. You can see that in the
heavily female paraprofessionals. But staying home only
seems attractive if it is for kids. Not working is not, in
itself, an attractive option for the educated classes.
The working parents in this study are, not surprisingly,
committed to the idea of working parents. Both men and
women overwhelmingly (90%+) favor "Employers being
more understanding of employees' dual roles as employees
and parents." At the same time, they are not blind to the
potential costs to kids of parents working. The upper-
middle class men and women, who have invested the most
in their careers, are the least likely to think there are major
costs to parents working. In response to the claim that
"Children who have parents working don't learn important
values from parents," 14.2% of the lower middle class
parents strongly disagree, about 23% of the middle class
parents strongly disagree, but fully 31% of the upper
middle class parents strongly disagree. Likewise, most
parents in all classes allow that "Children who have parents
working get into more trouble," but more than 40% of the
upper middles disagree.
The intellectuals and knowledge middle class seem to have
more flexibility for family life. We saw this in whether they
thought they could stay home with their children. We can also
see this difference when we compare who thinks about family
at work, and who thinks about work at home. Few parents feel
bad about leaving their kids when they go to work, but the
business middle women are most likely, at 27.2%, to report
that the often feel guilty. Likewise, more than a quarter of the
business women of the middle and upper-middle classes, as
well as the professional women, feel guilty that they don't
spend more time with their families, whereas only about 9% of
the knowledge working women of both classes do. And
within the middle class, only about half of the business and
paraprofessional workers think their families are understand-
ing about the demands of their jobs, whereas nearly 3/4ths of
the knowledge workers report such understanding.
This is a fascinating pair of tables:
About how often do you think about your children while
at your job?
When you are with your family, about how often do you
think about work?
The paraprofessionals are the most interesting column
here. That this bunch of moms is most likely to think of
their families while at work is perhaps not so surprising.
However, that none of them report thinking about work
when with their families is surprising. Perhaps these jobs
are appealing because you can leave the job at work.
The other standout fact from this table is how much the
intellectuals think about work when they are at home. The more
people do knowledge-oriented work, the more their work is part
of their round-the-clock identity. Cultural capital shapes who
you are; economic capital, by contrast, shapes what you have.
How Our Family Works
Men and women in this study differ in the expected ways
on housework. The different occupations do not differ
systematically in shopping, cooking, cleaning, or laundry,
except that intellectual men seem to spend a little more time
cooking than other men do. This may also reflect the
greater flexibility of intellectuals' jobs.
The higher classes are less likely to have their teenagers
do housework, and more likely to hire help for these tasks.
One kind of hiring help that does show a class fraction
difference is in whether parents ever hire tutors. The great
majority of parents in all categories say they never hire
tutors. However, a quarter of professional parents, and 30%
of the business middle class, sometimes hire tutors for their
children. Perhaps the professionals and business middle
want their kids to get good grades, but are less confident in
their own abilities to teach their children themselves.
The upper-middle class husbands and wives seem to be
happiest with their relationship with one another, and the
lower middles the least happy. I think this is mostly because
the upper middles communicate best with one another. The
intellectuals seem to communicate best of all. The survey

asked a series of questions of this form: "Many people have
disagreements in their relationships. Please indicate below the
approximate extent of agreement and disagreement between
you and your spouse/partner for each item on the following
list." The summary question in this series asked "Overall, I am
satisfied with my relationship with my spouse/partner."
In the other questions leading up to this summary
evaluation, intellectuals are the most pleased with the person-
ality characteristics and personal habits of their spouses. They
are most likely to be happy about how they make decisions and
resolve conflicts as a couple. And they are the happiest with
how they manage their leisure and spend time together. In
handling their duties are parents, intellectual men are second
most satisfied, after Business Middle men (the women did not
differ significantly). The paraprofessional women are most
likely to agree that "I have never regretted my relationship with
my partner, not even for moment," with the intellectuals falling
in the middle. Perhaps intellectuals on principle want to be
open to every idea, so they are unwilling to affirm that they
never for a moment had regrets about any subject.
Who Marries Whom?
One of the perennial puzzles of class and status research is
figuring out the social class of a married couple. Prior to the
1970s the sociological convention was simply to treat the
husband's class markers--occupation, education, and
income--as establishing the family's social class. Since
the 1970s many more women have their own occupations
and income outside the home, and sociology has been more
attentive to the distinctive contributions of women to all
aspects of social life. Which has made it hard, indeed, to
use one simple measure of a couple's joint social class.
My rule of thumb, based on research, experience, and
general knowledge of sex roles, is that a couple's social class
is primarily determined by his occupation and her education.
A quarter of our 346 married couples share the same job
group (that is, a manager married to a manager, a professional
to a professional, etc.). They are distributed thus:
Women, as a rule, like to marry up--they tend to choose
men who are a little more than the women are in each
category that affects resource provision--richer, with a
higher status job, more education, taller, older. For women
who are themselves high achievers, this is sometimes a
challenge. This table shows women who marry their class
equivalents or higher.
The outstanding fact is that the great majority of
women--2/3rds or more--in each occupational category
marry their class equivalents if they are in the highest
class, or marry up if they are not in the highest class.
Professional women are the most class-conserving: most
of them marry other professionals, and more than 4/5th
marry someone within the upper-middle class. Intellec-
tual women are not far behind. Female business
executives marry a broader range of men than their
professional and intellectual counterparts, but even 2/3rds
of them marry within the upper-middle class.
The middle class and lower-middle class women, by
contrast, married up more than they married within their
own class. The paraprofessionals and knowledge middle class
married up at better than three times the rate that they married
within the middle class. Indeed, these heavily female jobs
seem designed to be the college-educated counterparts to the
careers of upper-middle class men. These jobs include nurses,
therapists, and counselors among the paraprofessionals, while
among the mid-level knowledge workers they include
scientists, social scientists, and technicians below the Ph.D.
level, as well as teachers, librarians, and religious workers.
Now compare the patterns of women's and men's
marriages. The first column of data comes from the table

above. It shows the proportion of women in each
occupational fraction who marry men in the same occupa-
tional fraction. The second column shows the comparable
proportion of men who marry women in their same
occupational fraction.
There are many more women than men in the parapro-
fessional and knowledge middle categories. As we have
seen, these women tend to marry up to upper-middle-class
men. There are more men than women in the professions
and, to a lesser extent, the business middle categories.
Professional women marry professional men to a very high
extent. The remainder of professional men mostly marry
class-equivalent women (61.3%), with the largest group
marrying business managers. Specifically, 18.6% of profes-
sional men are married to female professionals. 34.0% are
married to managers, and only 8.7% are married to
intellectual women. Business middle men are also heavily
married to business upper-middle women, with more than
40% of these men marrying executives.
Vertical Inequalities vs. Horizontal Distinctions
The corporate managers and executives have the most
economic capital, while the intellectuals and culture producers
have the most cultural capital. They make a spectrum that runs
across the college-educated class in the United States today.
The professions occupy a midpoint in this spectrum, leaning
toward the managers. Intellectuals work with, think about, and
take their identity from the specific kinds of cultural
knowledge they work with. Managers try to make a profit
from the efficient management of any kind of cultural
knowledge. Professionals make a profit from the efficient
management of a specific kind of cultural knowledge.
These differences among the three top fractions of the
college-going class appear in how they approach family
life. Intellectuals tend to make marriages that are more
egalitarian, more flexible, invest more in their children's
education, and tend to take a more liberal view of social
life. Managers tend toward the other end of the spectrum on
all these points. Professionals tend to be in the middle.
Stratification studies in sociology tend to treat the
college-going class as all one stratum. We focus almost
exclusively on vertical inequality. Yet the horizontal
distinctions within the same broad stratum are more
important in shaping the actual lives of individuals and
families within the college class. While the spectrum is, in
principle, a fluid range of differences, sociology can
fruitfully map the distinctions within the college class by
focusing on the lives and families of managers, professio-
nals, and intellectuals.
