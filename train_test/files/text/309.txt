Abstract
This paper uses the 1995 and 2002 waves of the National Survey of Family Growth to
examine recent trends in cohabitation in the United States. We find increases in both the
prevalence and duration of unmarried cohabitation. Cohabitation continues to transform
children's family lives, as children are increasingly born to cohabiting mothers (18%
during 1997-2001) or later experience their mother's entry into a cohabiting union.
Consequently, we estimate that two-fifths of all children spend some time in a
cohabiting family by age 12. Because of substantial missing data in the 2002 NSFG, we
are unable to produce new estimates of divorce or of children's time in single-parent
families. Nonetheless, our results point to the steady growth of cohabitation and to the
evolving role of cohabitation in U.S. family life.

1. Introduction
By the early 1990s, cohabitation was well-established in U.S. family life. Once rare,
cohabitation had become a normal part of adult union formation and was rapidly
spreading to families with children (Bumpass and Lu 2000). By 1995, nearly two-fifths
of all children could expect to experience maternal cohabitation during childhood
(Bumpass and Lu 2000). Cohabitation has maintained this rapid pace of expansion
through the present (Chandra, Martinez, Mosher, Abma, and Jones 2005; Fitch,
Goeken, and Ruggles 2005; Mincieli, Manlove, McGarrett, Moore, and Ryan 2007;
Schoen, Landale, and Daniels 2007).
As cohabitation continues to transform American families, existing statistics on the
prevalence of cohabiting families have become outdated. In the current study, we use
the 1995 and 2002 waves (Cycles V and VI) of the National Survey of Family Growth
to replicate and update Bumpass and Lu's 2000 article on trends in U.S. cohabitation.
This paper, thus, increases our knowledge of the prevalence of U.S. cohabitation from
the perspective of both adults and children. It examines the links between key family
characteristics and cohabitation, and between cohabitation and subsequent marriage.
Because of extensive missing data on marital separation dates in the 2002 NSFG, we
can make only a limited exploration of whether the overall stability of children's family
lives has changed as cohabitation became further established in American family life;
likewise, we are unable to update Bumpass and Lu's estimates of the time children
spend in a single-mother family. Overall, our analyses demonstrate that cohabitation
continues to grow unabated from the perspective of both adults and children.
2B
2. Background
Since the 1970s, the rise in cohabitation had dramatically changed the way Americans
formed families. By 1995, cohabitation had become common: 45% of women aged 19-
44 had ever lived with an unmarried partner (Bumpass and Lu 2000). A majority of
women first forming partnerships cohabited instead of marrying directly; likewise, a
majority of first marriages followed cohabitation. U.S. cohabiting unions formed in the
early 1990s were typically transient, as cohabiting couples rapidly married or separated
(Bumpass and Lu 2000). Always a short-lived state, cohabitation became less stable and
less tied to marriage as it spread; just over half of all cohabiting couples married within
10 years (Bumpass and Lu 2000). Cohabitation has since expanded to half of all women
ages 15-44 in 2002 (Chandra et al. 2005: Table 47).
The increase in nonmarital cohabitation had important implications for families
with children (Bumpass and Lu 2000; Seltzer 2004). The proportion of children born to
Demographic Research: Volume 19, Article 47
http://www.demographic-research.org 1665
cohabiting parents increased from 11% in 1990-94 to 18% by 2001, when cohabiting
childbearing achieved parity with out-of-union childbearing (Bumpass and Lu 2000;
Mincieli et al. 2007). More commonly, children experienced their mother's cohabitation
after birth, when she entered a new cohabiting relationship (Bumpass and Lu 2000).
Combining all types of cohabiting families with children, about 35-40 percent of U.S.
children were expected to live with their mother and a cohabiting partner in the early
1990s (Bumpass and Lu 2000; Heuveline and Timberlake 2004).
Despite spreading widely, cohabitation lacks a clearly defined and commonly
understood position in the U.S. family system (Cherlin 2004; Manning and Smock
2005). Cohabitation can be a stage in the marriage process for some couples, a
temporary alternative to marriage, or an alternative to being single for others (Smock
2000). In some instances, cohabiting childbearing may be jointly planned with marriage
(Musick 2007; Wu and Musick Forthcoming). More commonly, cohabitation enables
couples to enter into parenthood or to jointly parent children, without first overcoming
barriers to marriage, including economic stability and relationship quality (Edin and
Reed 2005; Smock, Manning, and Porter 2005). In doing so, cohabitation temporarily
assumes traditional functions of marriage. Furthermore, the role that cohabitation plays
in the family varies by education, income, and race and ethnicity. For instance, college-
educated women are the least likely to ever-cohabit (Bumpass and Lu 2000), while
Hispanic cohabitation is uniquely linked to reproduction (Landale and Oropesa 2007).

The rapid growth in cohabiting families with children has raised concerns over the
potential consequences for child well-being. Children raised by a cohabiting parent
appear to have poorer outcomes than the children of married parents, across a range of
indicators, including academic performance, emotional problems and depression, and
behavioral problems and delinquency (Brown 2004; Brown 2006; Dunifon and
Kowaleski-Jones 2002; Hofferth 2006; Raley, Frisco, and Wildsmith 2005).
A number of factors make U.S. cohabiting unions potentially disadvantageous
environments for raising children, including lower incomes, lower relationship quality,
and higher dissolution rates than marriages (Cavanagh and Huston 2006; Graefe and
Lichter 1999; Manning and Brown 2006; Manning, Smock, and Majumdar 2004;
Osborne and McLanahan 2007; Raley and Wildsmith 2004). Many of these differences
predate union formation, and thus reflect the disproportionate selection of couples with
the least resources and the lowest expectations for relationship stability into cohabiting
relationships and cohabiting parenthood (Kenney and McLanahan 2006; Lillard, Brien,
and Waite 1995). Yet, cohabitation and marriage differ in fundamental ways that may
have implications for child well-being, not least the enforceable public and legal
3 Smock (2000) provides a comprehensive overview of these differences. See also Lichter et al. (2006),
Manning (2001, 2004), Musick (2007), and Wildsmith and Raley (2006).
Kennedy & Bumpass: Cohabitation and children's living arrangements

commitment required of married couples that makes marriages more difficult to
dissolve (Nock 2005; Waite and Gallagher 2000).
Data limitations prevent us from directly addressing the question of whether
children's family lives have grown increasingly unstable as a consequence of rising
cohabitation rates. By charting trends in the prevalence and stability of cohabitation,
however, we will make a limited exploration of the implications of the continued
increase in cohabitation for children's family contexts.

3. Data and methods
8B
3.1 Data
We use data from the 1995 and 2002 cycles of the U.S. National Survey of Family
Growth (NSFG). Interviews were conducted with 7,643 women ages 15-44 in 2002 and
with 10,847 women in 1995. Both interview protocols include complete pregnancy and
birth histories, as well as cohabitation and marriage histories. The 2002 NSFG is the
most recent and comprehensive data source on U.S. families and allows us to study the
recent cohabitation experiences of women and their children.
There is one very serious limitation of the 2002 NSFG: as a result of routing errors
in the survey instrument, marriage dissolution data are missing for over one-third of all
marriages that subsequently dissolved. Data are missing entirely for women whose
husbands had children from a previous relationship and for over 90 percent of currently
separated respondents. Black and Hispanic women and women who cohabited before
marriage have particularly high rates of missing data. Time periods closer to 2002 have
especially high rates of missing data because women who are currently separated were
more likely to have dissolved their marriages recently.
Consequently, analyses which must incorporate dates of marital dissolution are
very likely not defensible. Because separation dates are almost entirely missing for two
distinct respondent groups, standard imputation techniques may be inappropriate. In
addition, if trends in family formation and dissolution have changed over time, using
imputed marital dissolution data may underestimate the magnitude of any recent
changes. Because of these limitations, our analyses of children's family instability are
exploratory and do not rely on the imputed dates of marital separation.
Despite these limitations, the NSFG remains the best data set available for
studying recent trends in cohabitation from the perspective of women and children.

1979, the Fragile Families Study, and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (for recent studies, see: Lichter
et al. 2006 (NLSY); Mincieli et al. 2007 (ECLS); and Teitler et al. 2006 (FF)). These longitudinal studies

3.2 Methods
This paper follows the approach used in Bumpass and Lu (2000) to produce new
estimates of the cohabitation experience of women and children and to describe
children's family structures at birth and later family transitions. We replicate their
estimates from the 1995 survey, and update them using new data from 2002. Our
approach will differ in some instances due to differences between the data sets,
including missing data and smaller sample sizes. The 1995 estimates presented here are
very similar but not always identical to those published by Bumpass and Lu (2000). All
estimates are weighted, including regressions.
As noted above (see 3.1), we are reluctant to produce estimates that require
information on the timing of marital dissolution. Specifically, because we do not know
when a marriage ended with certainty, we cannot assign a separation to a particular
period, nor can we calculate a child's total exposure to the risk of marital dissolution.
Consequently, estimates of the proportion of children who experience parental
separation, of period trends in family instability, or of the duration of time a child born
to a married mother spends in a single-parent household cannot be produced with
confidence. Instead, we produce estimates of the proportion of children ever
experiencing family dissolution by specific ages for recent birth cohorts. We restrict our
estimates to children 10 years and younger in order to capture recent experiences (with
little overlap between surveys) and to minimize the potential impact of age-censoring
(discussed below).
A second analytic challenge results from the upper age limit of 44 imposed on the
female sample. This age limit creates no problem for analyses of women's current
union status or past cohabitation experience, estimates that can be compared across
surveys within age at interview groups. At periods distant from the survey, however, it
becomes increasingly difficult to accurately represent family experiences, as older
respondent ages are observed only in recent time periods. To the extent we use data
from older children, or from periods further back in time, the data are progressively
representative only of unusually young mothers, those who were most likely to have
given birth outside of marriage.

For a more detailed discussion of age-censoring, see
Rindfuss et al. (1982) and Bumpass and Lu (2000).
Following Bumpass and Lu, we address age-censoring by calculating period life
tables for the 5-year periods prior to the each survey. Exposure begins at the beginning
cannot produce period estimates of women's cohabitation experience or children's living arrangements at
older child and teenage ages. The cross-sectional Study of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) provides
recent divorce data but does not collect detailed cohabitation histories.
5 The mother of a 15-year old child in the 2002 NSFG could be at most 29 years old at the time of the child's
birth. In fact, the median mother's age for children in this age-group in the NSFG was just 23, substantially
less than the contemporary national average of 26 years (Mathews and Hamilton 2002).
Kennedy & Bumpass: Cohabitation and children's living arrangements
1668 http://www.demographic-research.org
of the period or at a child's birth, if it occurs during the period. Exposure ends at the
end of the period, at the time of the event, when a child turns 12 in the 5-year period, or
a female respondent turns 40. Life table methodology follows the procedures described
in Bumpass and Lu (2000), with one exception. Because of the smaller 2002 sample,
the number of cases available to estimate children's cohabitation experience at older
ages was significantly reduced. In order to minimize the possibility of a small number
of children influencing our overall estimates, we report estimates for children's
cohabitation experience only through age 12 instead of age 16. See Bumpass (1984) and
Andersson and Philipov (2002) for further discussion of this methodology.
Finally, we should note that a child's family history is constructed using mother's
partnership histories and information on each child's birth. For the analysis of
children's cohabitation and living arrangements, we create an analysis file with children
as the unit of analysis. Our estimation procedures make the simplifying assumption that
each child resides with his or her mother throughout childhood. In doing so, we
misrepresent the experience of children who live with their father or other relatives
during childhood. Earlier studies have repeatedly demonstrated the robustness of this
procedure (Bumpass, Raley, and Sweet 1995; Bumpass and Sweet 1989; Raley and
Wildsmith 2001).
10B
3.3 Sample composition and coverage
Table 1 compares the background characteristics of the NSFG V and NSFG VI (female)
samples--here, as elsewhere, the estimates are weighted (see 3.2). The period between
the two surveys was one of rapid growth in the Hispanic population (Chapa and De La
Rosa 2004), a population with unique family patterns (Landale and Oropesa 2007).
Accordingly, the weighted proportion of Hispanics among NSFG respondents rose
substantially, from 11 percent to 15 percent, while the proportion of non-Hispanic
whites declined to 66 percent. By 2002, over half of Hispanic respondents were foreign-
born. In addition, the coverage of Hispanic and foreign-born populations may have
changed between NSFG cycles. The 1995 NSFG sample was drawn from the
respondent pool of an existing survey, the 1993 National Health Interview Survey
(Mosher 1998). Immigrants to the U.S. arriving after 1993 were not interviewed. In
contrast, the 2002 NSFG includes immigrant women who arrived as recently as 2002
and Hispanic respondents were oversampled.

It is unclear what impact, if any, these
coverage differences have on our estimates of Hispanic cohabitation and nonmarital
fertility. We attempt to minimize the impact by distinguishing between foreign-born
6 Response rates for Hispanics were as high or higher than those of non-Hispanic whites in both surveys
(Kelly, Mosher, Duffer, and Kinsey 1997; Groves et al. 2005).
Demographic Research: Volume 19, Article 47
http://www.demographic-research.org 1669
and U.S.-born Hispanics. When possible, we compare our results with alternative
sources, including vital statistics, in order to identify any potential discrepancies.
Unfortunately, sample sizes do not allow us to analyze important national-origin
differences in Hispanic family structure (Landale and Oropesa 2007).

The educational composition of the sample also changed substantially between the
two surveys. The proportion of women with a high school degree or GED decreased
from 38% to 29%, while the college-educated population increased. Although the
proportion of the sample with less 12 years of schooling remained stable, at 11-12
percent, the proportion who were Hispanic increased to 42% by 2002, replacing non-
Hispanic whites as the largest ethnic group within this education level.

are similar to the trends described above. In addition, teenage childbearing declined,
accompanied by an increase in childbearing at older ages.

4. Findings
11B
4.1 Women's union formation
The continued rapid expansion of cohabitation is demonstrated in Figure 1 and Table 2
using two measures: women's lifetime cohabitation experience and current cohabitation
status. The percentage of women ages 19-44 who have ever cohabited increased
substantially between 1995 and 2002, from 45 percent to 54 percent. Increases of nearly
10 percentage points are observed at all ages except the youngest, ages 19-24, where
cohabitation experience increased only slightly.

Current cohabitation also increased, from 17 to 19 percent among all unmarried
women, and from 15 to 20 percent among never-married women. Increases for never-
married women were particularly large in key premarital age groups (under age 30). In
contrast, current cohabitation appeared to decline among previously married
respondents. Due to small sample sizes and missing data on marital separation, we are
not confident of this result and do not see any ready explanation for it. We do note that
Demographic Research: Volume 19, Article 47
http://www.demographic-research.org 1671
premarital cohabitation increased between the two surveys for these previously married
respondents.

The final columns of Table 2 present the proportion of current unions (at the time
of interview) that were cohabiting rather than married, and here we see a modest
increase to 15 percent by 2002. The increase was very large among the youngest
women (19-24): from 30 to 43 percent. This suggests that cohabitation continues to
facilitate delays in marriage. In results not shown in a table, we find that the overall
proportion ever in a union declined by only one percent between 1995 and 2002, while
the proportion ever-married declined by 6 percent. As we would expect, this pattern is
concentrated in the youngest age category where the proportion ever in a union was
unchanged, but the proportion ever having married declined by 15 percent (from 28 to
24 percent).
Table 3 presents the percentage of women who have ever cohabited by educational
attainment and race and ethnicity. Cohabitation experience increased at all education
levels between the two time periods, but large educational differentials persist. The
proportion that had ever cohabited increased at least 20 percent among women who had
completed high school (or more) and just over 10 percent among those who had not. By
2002, the major difference is found between women who had not attended college and
those who had (almost two-thirds and one-half, respectively, had ever cohabited). In
contrast, differences by race and ethnicity remained relatively small. Non-Hispanic
whites, the group most likely to have cohabited by 1995, show the smallest change in
cohabitation experience between the two surveys, about 15 percent. Cohabitation
Kennedy & Bumpass: Cohabitation and children's living arrangements
1672 http://www.demographic-research.org
experience appears to have increased most rapidly among foreign-born Hispanics, from
one-third in 1995 to one-half of all respondents in 2002. It is hard to interpret this
finding, however, because it is likely influenced by the higher proportion of recent
immigrants among the foreign born in the 2002 survey (see 3.3).

The measures discussed so far reflect both recent trends and past experiences. We
can better observe recent changes by examining the first union formation during the 5
years before each survey (see Table 4). Cohabitation has become even more prevalent
as the context of first union formation--68 percent of all first unions formed during the
period 1997-2001 began as cohabitation rather than marriage, compared to 60 percent
in the early 1990s. Looking at first marriage cohorts, the proportion who cohabited
before marriage reached 62 percent for women marrying in 1997-2002 compared to 57
percent during the early 1990s. Of these women, a large majority had cohabited only
with their husband.

4.2 Union transitions
Previous studies have shown that cohabiting is a short-term state in the U.S. as
consensual unions either rapidly dissolve or transition to formal marriage (Bumpass and
Lu 2000; Bumpass and Sweet 1989; Lichter, Qian, and Mellott 2006). Updating earlier
studies, we use multiple decrement life table techniques to examine the pathways out of
women's cohabiting unions during the 5-year periods prior to each NSFG wave
(Bumpass and Lu 2000; Bumpass and Sweet 1989).
The results presented in Table 5 focus on first cohabiting unions, and analyze only
those unions formed prior to first marriage.
F

F
Based on the rates observed during the
period 1997-2001, more than half of U.S. cohabiting couples (56%) will either marry or
separate within the first two years following union formation. This represents a large
increase in the duration of cohabitation over the early 1990s, where more than two-
thirds married or separated within 24 months. The proportion of unions that would be
expected to remain as unmarried cohabitation increased substantially at every duration.
By the late 1990s, the observed survival rates suggest that nearly 70% of couples in
cohabiting unions will continue to cohabit for at least one year, one-third of couples for
at least three years, and one-fifth for four-years.
7 Analysis of all cohabiting unions yielded similar trends.

Initially, the estimated percentage increases in intact cohabiting unions are
accompanied by declines in the proportion of unions expected to result in marriage (5-8
percentage points at durations 1-4 years). By year 5, however, the survival rates in both
time periods imply that about half of all cohabiting couples will have married. Thus, the
initial decline in the proportion married appears to be largely the result of prolonged
cohabitation and delayed marriage.
The lengthening of cohabitation occurred universally across race and ethnic groups
(results not shown). Compositional changes also contributed to the overall increase, as
the cohabiting unions of Hispanic women survive longer, on average, than unions
formed by non-Hispanic white and Black women. Rates from the late 1990s suggest a
median union survival of more than two years for Hispanic women compared to about
one and a half years for non-Hispanic white women. This finding is consistent with
research characterizing Hispanic cohabitation as a temporary substitute for marriage,
and may reflect both higher cohabiting fertility rates and the longer duration of
Hispanic cohabiting unions with children (Landale and Oropesa 2007; Manning 2004;
Smock 2000; Wildsmith and Raley 2006). Note, however, that the large majority of
Hispanic cohabiting unions still transition to marriage or dissolve within five years, and
thus for most couples cohabitation is a temporary state.
During the short period of time that elapsed between the two surveys, the extent
and nature of cohabitation continued to evolve. Dissolution rates while cohabiting went
down substantially while marriage within 5 years declined only slightly. The trends
observed previously by Bumpass and Lu (2000)--of increasing instability while
cohabiting, and declining marriage from cohabitation--were consistent with a
movement of less committed couples into cohabitation as the associated stigma
Demographic Research: Volume 19, Article 47
http://www.demographic-research.org 1675
weakened (Bumpass and Lu 2000). The meaning of these new trends is less clear. The
prolonged duration of cohabitation may reflect longer engagements to marry as the
social pressure to marry loosens and, perhaps, increased economic insecurity.
Irrespective of marriage intentions, longer spells of cohabitation may also be associated
with increasing fertility in cohabiting unions, and perhaps greater public acceptance of
births to unmarried mothers. Whatever the specific reasons for these changes, the
increase in unmarried couples living together and the longer duration of these
arrangements may signal a shift in the meaning of cohabitation for some couples. The
impact on the stability of marriages formed following cohabitation cannot be measured
with these data because we cannot measure how long these unions ultimately lasted.
13B
4.3 Children's family contexts at birth
We now turn to the implications of the increase in cohabitation for children's family
contexts, beginning with the mother's marital or cohabiting status at a child's birth. As
it has for many decades, nonmarital childbearing increased throughout the 1990s. Of
births reported as occurring 1997-2000, 34 percent were to an unmarried mother,
compared to 27 percent for births 1990-1994 (Table 6). Note that while the NSFG
estimate of nonmarital fertility in the later period is similar to vital statistics for 1999
(33%), the earlier period estimate is substantially lower than vital statistics in 1992
(30%) (Ventura and Bachrach 2000). Although vital statistics data provide an important
comparison point to the survey estimates, they may differ for reasons including the
imputation of marital status at birth when not collected on birth certificates and the
treatment of legally separated parents (Wu 2008). Note also that both vital statistics
estimates and survey estimates of nonmarital fertility can be influenced by the stigma
associated with nonmarital births (Wu, Bumpass, and Musick 2001).

aPoint estimates are calculated using imputed values for date of marital separation
bIn 2002, because of the large amount of missing marital separation dates, parent's marital status at birth could not be determined
with certainty for 5% of children in 2002. Bounds were created by assuming 1) that all of these children were born to married
parents, and 2) that all were born after the marriage dissolved.
As in the prior decade (Bumpass and Lu 2000), the growth in unmarried births was
driven by a shift from married to cohabiting childbearing. By the period 1997-2001,
half of all nonmarital births were to cohabiting parents. Two recent studies also find
this: a Child Trends study that uses the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study's 2001
birth cohort (Mincieli et al. 2007) and the Fragile Families study of children born
between 1998 and 2000 in metropolitan areas (McLanahan et al. 2003; Teitler,
Reichman, and Koball 2006).
F

F
By the late 1990s, 18 percent of children were born to
cohabiting parents, a finding replicated by Child Trends (Mincieli et al. 2007).
The results just discussed and presented in the left-hand side panel of Table 6 are
calculated using imputed values of parent marital status at birth when it could not be
directly observed from union histories. As we noted in our discussion of the data, an
unacceptably large number of respondents had missing values for marital dissolution
dates. If a child was born after the start of one of the affected marriages, it was
impossible to know definitively whether the birth occurred during the marriage. (138
births have missing data on marital status at birth during 1997-2001, compared to just 5
births during 1990-94). We can, however, evaluate the degree of uncertainty this
8 Note that our estimate of births to cohabiting couples in 1997-2001 (18%) is substantially larger than
estimates published by the CDC using NSFG (Chandra et al. 2005). This discrepancy appears to result from a
coding error on a variable included in the public release file of the NSFG VI data set (RMAROUT6). Nearly
20% of all cohabiting births in the NSFG were miscoded as unmarried non-cohabiting births. All were born to
cohabiting parents who subsequently married. In most instances, first births within cohabiting unions were
coded correctly, while second births and higher order births were not.
Demographic Research: Volume 19, Article 47
http://www.demographic-research.org 1677
introduces. We estimate the upper and lower bounds for the period 1997-2001 by
identifying the 5 percent of births whose classification is affected and making two
extreme assumptions about the circumstances at their birth: 1) all of these births
occurred while their mother was still married; and 2) all occurred when she was no
longer married.
The bounds resulting from these assumptions are shown in the right-hand panel of
Table 6. Cohabiting births are unchanged. Our estimate of unmarried non-cohabiting
births ranges from 14 to 17 percent, while the estimate for marital births ranges from 68
to 65 percent. Our overall conclusions are unchanged--nonmarital childbearing has
increased between the two periods, and this change is mostly, if not entirely, the result
of a shift from childbearing in marriage to childbearing in cohabitation.
Table 7 presents educational and race differences in children's family structure at
birth. The proportion of children born to unmarried parents continues to vary greatly by
socioeconomic status and race and ethnicity. Educational differences, already large in
1990-94, persisted throughout the decade. Among children born in the late 1990s to
mothers without high school degrees (an increasingly selective group), 61% were born
to an unmarried mother, including one-third born to cohabiting parents.
F
9
F
For women
with a high school degree, married births fell to just 57% of all births by the late 1990s,
while cohabiting childbearing grew to nearly one-quarter. Women who attended some
college continued to give birth primarily within marriage, but cohabiting childbearing
also increased noticeably, reaching 15%. Nonmarital childbearing changed only slightly
for four-year college graduates, among whom it remains very low at 7% of all births.
Despite the persistence of large educational differences, sizable increases in cohabiting
childbearing are found for all women except the most highly educated.
Race and ethnic differences also remained substantial, but with two potentially
significant trends. There was little net change in unmarried childbearing among both
non-Hispanic whites and blacks (a 3 percent increase and decrease, respectively), with
differences remaining very large (21 percent compared to 68 percent of all births). The
slight increase in marital childbearing among African-Americans, to 32 percent, may
signal an important departure from the long-term increases in nonmarital
childbearing.
F
10
F
Also important, is that cohabiting births increased from 17 to 27 percent
of all births to non-Hispanic blacks. Consequently, a majority of African-American
children born in the late 1990s were born into a two-parent family.
9 Compositional changes may partly explain the overall increase; specifically the increasing proportion of
Hispanic women among women without a high school degree combined with increases in cohabiting
childbearing among Hispanic women.
10 Vital statistics records a nearly identical decline: peaking at 71% in 1994 and falling to 69% by the late
1990s (Martin et al. 2006).

Although the largest changes appear to occur among Hispanic families, our
estimates based on the NSFG overstate the trends observed in Vital Statistics for the
same period. Taking all Hispanic women together, NSFG estimates of nonmarital
childbearing increase from 32 percent in the early 1990s to 46 percent in the late 1990s
(Table 7), and almost all of this increase appears to have occurred in cohabitation. In
contrast, Ventura and Bachrach (2000) estimate that Hispanic nonmarital fertility
increased from roughly 39 percent in 1992
F
11
F
to 42 percent by 1999, ultimately reaching
11 The earlier estimate of Hispanic nonmarital fertility in vital statistics is based on imputation in instances
where parent's marital status was not collected on the birth certificates. Prior to 1995, in California, parent's
marital status was inferred using a procedure that substantially under-identified Hispanic marriages. In 1995,
Kennedy & Bumpass: Cohabitation and children's living arrangements
1680 http://www.demographic-research.org
46% in 2004 (Martin et al. 2006). Hence, while both foreign-born and U.S.-born
Hispanic nonmarital fertility appear to be overestimated in the 2002 NSFG, the Vital
Statistics series confirm that there is a substantial upwards trend in nonmarital
childbearing among Hispanic women.
Finally, Table 7 presents estimates of births to unmarried mothers by mother's age
at birth. Strikingly, more than half of births to women under age 25 now occur to
unmarried mothers. By 2002, a majority of unmarried mothers ages 20 and older
reported cohabiting at the time of their child's birth, and only unmarried teenage
mothers gave birth predominantly without a partner. Regardless of mother's age,
nonmarital childbearing increasingly occurred in coresidential unions.
14B
4.4 Children's family transitions
15B
4.4.1 Cohabitation
Despite the increase in cohabiting births, children most commonly experienced mother's
cohabitation during later family transitions, after birth to a single mother or the
separation of birth parents. Table 8 presents life table estimates of the proportion of
children expected to live with their mother and a cohabiting partner during the periods
1990-94 and 1997-2001, for children born to a single non-cohabiting mother and for
those born to a married mother.
Overall, the proportion of these children expected to enter cohabiting families by
age 12 increased from 21 percent to 25 percent based on rates observed in the early and
late 1990s. For children born to single non-cohabiting mothers, the likelihood of
cohabitation increased substantially, from 56 to 63 percent by age 12. Among children
born to married mothers in both periods, about 15 percent are expected to enter a
cohabiting family by age 12--after their mother's marriage disrupts. Overall, if we
combine these estimates with births to cohabiting parents, about 39 percent of children
would be expected to experience any maternal cohabitation before age 12 based on
rates during the late 1990s, compared to just 30 percent in the early 1990s.
when marital status was explicitly collected, vital statistics estimates of the percentage of births to unmarried
Hispanic parents decreased by 17% in California and 2% nationwide between 1994 and 1995 (Ventura and
Bachrach 2000). An additional discontinuity in the time-series occurred between 1993 and 1994 when Texas
added a direct question on marital status to the birth certificate, doubling the estimated number of nonmarital
births in Texas.

With reasonable assumptions about the shape of the
hazard distributions, however, we can calculate the ratio of the proportion by 16 to the
proportion by age 12 as estimated from the 1995 survey, and apply this to the age 12
estimates from the 2002 survey. The results of this procedure suggest that the
proportion of children expected to ever experience a cohabiting family increased from
37 percent in 1990-1994 to 46 percent in 1997-2001. Almost half of the children in the
United States can be expected to spend some time with a cohabiting mother.
To better understand transitions into cohabiting families, we estimate a pooled
proportional hazard model for children born to non-cohabiting mothers who were at risk
of cohabitation during the periods 1990-94 and 1997-2001. The multivariate results,
with robust standard errors controlling for the clustering of children in families, are
shown in Table 9. To illustrate the magnitude of any differences, we provide life table
estimates of the proportion of children expected to transition into cohabiting families by
age 12 for the period 1997-2001 for each variable included in the model (partnership
status at birth, education, race, and mother's age at birth). It is important to keep in
mind that this column (Table 9, Column 4) and the matching life table estimates for
marriage (Table 9, Column 8) are predicted values without controls for any other
variables in the table.
12 Bumpass and Lu (2000) report estimates through age 16. We restrict estimates to age 12 because sample
size reductions in 2002 resulted in insufficient sample sizes at older child ages.

Demographic Research: Volume 19, Article 47
http://www.demographic-research.org 1683
Overall, cohabitation risks increased by one-third between the two periods once
the other variables are taken into account (Column 1, Table 9). One contributing factor
was declining marital childbearing, a trend that exposed a higher proportion (but not
necessarily number) of children to the higher cohabitation rates of unmarried mothers.
In the simple life table estimates in column 4, we see a pronounced decline from
high-school graduates to college graduates in the proportion of these children expected
to experience cohabitation by age 12. However, controlling for background
characteristics (column 1), only children of college graduates differ from the other
educational categories, and their risk is 40% lower than the children of high school
dropouts.
Controlling for mother's marital status, education, and age at a child's birth, non-
Hispanic white children have the highest transition rates into cohabiting families (the
risk is about a quarter lower among the others). In contrast, the unadjusted life table
estimates show that black children are the most likely to enter cohabiting households.
These seemingly contradictory findings, observed previously by Bumpass and Lu
(2000), are the result of the high rates of out-of-union childbearing among African-
American mothers, and the consequently higher risk of entering a cohabiting family.
This was confirmed by eliminating the control for marital status from the hazard; the
coefficient for African-American children became positive and significant in this model
(not shown). Nearly half of non-Hispanic Black children born to single or married
mothers are expected to experience maternal cohabitation by age 12 (column 4 of Table
9).
Mother's age at birth is very strongly and negatively associated with children's
experience of maternal cohabitation; controlling for all other variables the risk
decreases by about two-thirds if a mother is age 25 or older at birth. Among other
factors, this may reflect the greater stability of the marriages formed by older women,
less interest in having a husband or partner, or the reduced availability of suitable
partners at older ages.
16B
4.4.2 Marriage following birth to an unmarried mother
Table 9 also presents multivariate hazard and unadjusted life table estimates predicting
transitions into married families for children born to unmarried mothers. Overall, the
risk of mother's marriage for these children remained unchanged between the two
periods, controlling for partnership status at birth, education, race, and mother's age at
birth. Our unadjusted life table estimates also showed little change in marriage risks.
Children born into a cohabiting union were 90 percent more likely to enter married
families than the children of single mothers. Even so, about 45 percent of the non-union
Kennedy & Bumpass: Cohabitation and children's living arrangements
1684 http://www.demographic-research.org
births could expect their mother to marry by age 12 under the transition rates observed
in the late 1990s (compared to 66 percent of cohabiting births).
The likelihood of marriage increases greatly with mother's education--for
instance, 74% of children of 4-year college graduates can expect their mother to marry,
compared to 40% of the children of high school dropouts (and the differences are
monotonic in the hazard model). About 40 percent of black children born to unmarried
mothers will experience their mother's marriage by age 12, compared to two-thirds of
non-Hispanic white children, and half of Hispanic children. These differences persist in
the hazard models even after controlling for cohabitation status at birth.
Finally, children born to younger mothers are significantly more likely to
experience their mother's marriage than children born to older mothers. The children of
older mothers also experience less maternal cohabitation, so this may reflect the limited
partnership markets available to older women. Since unmarried motherhood remains
uncommon among women ages 25 and older (Table 7), low rates of marriage may also
reflect the selectivity of older unmarried mothers.
17B
4.4.3 Children's experience of disruption of family of birth
Bumpass and Lu (2000) used the 1995 NSFG to estimate the total time children would
spend in each of three types of families: cohabiting parent, single parent, and married
parent households. Unfortunately, this type of analysis is inappropriate with the 2002
data because of the extent of missing marital separation dates.
Nevertheless, we can shed some light on the implications of increased cohabitation
for family stability by using the information on whether a disruption has occurred to
compare the cumulative experience of children observed in 1990-94 and 1997-2001.
Figure 2 presents the proportion of children born to married or cohabiting mothers who
had separated or divorced parents at the time of interview, a birth cohort measure with
important limitations. The separations experienced by older children in the surveys
could date up to ten years prior to interview. In addition, because this approach yields
smaller samples at each age than a synthetic cohort approach, we must pool data across
several years of age. The estimates approximate the proportion of children who
experienced parental separation by the mid-point of the pooled ages, and age intervals
were chosen in order to roughly estimate parental separation at whole years of age (e.g.
estimates at 1 year are based on children ages 0-23 months, 2 years at 6-41 months).
Importantly, these estimates are unadjusted percentages that do not control for any
differences between cohabiting and married parents that contribute to the selection into
cohabitation and to differences in separation rates between these union types.

Notes: Only children born into a married or cohabiting union are included in these calculations. Child age is estimated as the mid-
point of the ages used to calculate the parental dissolution proportion (e.g. children ages 0-23 months are used to calculate age
1; ages 6-41 are used to calculated age 2).
Overall dissolution rates changed little (see Figure 2). By approximate age 9, about
30% of children experienced the dissolution of their parents' union in both time
periods.
F
13
F
Figure 2 also shows results stratified by marital status at birth. In 2002,
without accounting for selectivity, over 20% of marital births and over 50% of
cohabiting births had experienced their parents' separation by age 9. Although the
trends between 1995 and 2002 suggest growing stability within each union type, the
differences are not statistically different, and the small sample sizes make detection of
differences unlikely for cohabitation. Thus, the overall trend in family dissolution is one
of relative constancy.
13 Additional estimates including all children ever in union yielded similar results; fewer than one-third of
children experienced union dissolution by age 9 in both surveys, and the time trends were indistinguishable.
Kennedy & Bumpass: Cohabitation and children's living arrangements
1686 http://www.demographic-research.org
Although it is inappropriate to use the imputed 2002 NSFG data to produce point
estimates of children's family instability, the 1995 data can be used to understand the
potential implications of increased cohabitation. Using the 1995 NSFG, we estimate
that 32% of children--71% of children born to cohabiting parents and 26% of children
born to married parents--could expect to experience parental separation by age 12
during the period 1990-1994.
F
14
F
Had union dissolution rates following marital and
cohabiting births remained at 1995 levels, the proportion of children experiencing
parental separation by age 12 would have increased by 4 percentage points. This
estimate assumes that all of the new cohabiting parents in the late 1990s adopted the
very high rates of union dissolution of the more select cohabiting parents in the early
1990s and that married parents maintained early 1990s rates of marital dissolution. If
the stability of cohabiting parent families has improved with the increased prevalence of
cohabiting childbearing, the impact would be smaller.
Although exploratory, the evidence suggests that the increase in cohabiting
childbearing has resulted in at most a small increase the instability of children's birth
families. This could reflect a reshuffling of families, as less stable couples increasingly
giving birth in cohabitation rather than marriage; on its own, this process should not
affect the overall population levels of family dissolution. Until new data become
available, the true implications of increased cohabitation for children's family lives will
remain in doubt.

5. Discussion
As cohabitation continues to spread rapidly, cohabitation has become the prevailing
way in which adult women enter unions and is fast becoming a normal context in which
to bear and parent children. The majority of women of nearly all ages, educational, and
race and ethnic backgrounds have some cohabitation experience. With this most recent
expansion of cohabitation, the time spent cohabiting now lasts longer--on average,
nearly two years--as couples postpone the transition to marriage.
Cohabitation continues to drive changes in structure of families with children. By
the late 1990s, we estimate that nearly one-in-five births were to cohabiting couples,
over half of all births to unmarried mothers. Children born to unmarried, non-cohabiting
mothers also experienced an increased likelihood of ever living with their mother and a
cohabiting partner. Our best estimate, based on rates in the late 1990s, is that almost
half of the children in the United States can be expected to spend some time in a
cohabiting family. It should be noted that the relevant trends have likely continued in
14 These results are consistent with published findings: see (Andersson 2002: p.353, Table 5).

the ensuing 8 or so years. For example, the share of all births that were to unmarried
mothers increased to 37 percent by 2005 from 33 percent in 2000 (Martin et al. 2007).
Cohabitation in the United States remains complex--both a part of the marriage
process for some couples, and a temporary alternative to marriage for other couples. As
cohabiting childbearing becomes more common, the characteristics of the people
selecting into cohabiting parenthood--socioeconomic and demographic composition,
relationship quality, the planning of births--may shift. As it does, the place of
cohabiting families in the family system may change accordingly. Broader demographic
shifts, the rapid growth in the Hispanic population and increasing educational
attainment, may themselves have consequences for the overall characteristics of
cohabiting unions. Ultimately, the implications of increased cohabitation for child well-
being will depend on how closely these new cohabiting families resemble the families
who entered cohabiting parenthood when it was unusual and highly selective.
