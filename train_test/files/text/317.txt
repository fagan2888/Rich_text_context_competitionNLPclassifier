Aims We aimed to assess potential associations between different leucocyte compo-
nents and coronary heart disease (CHD) in a prospective cohort study, and to put these
findings in context of other relevant prospective studies in a meta-analysis.
Methods and results We report data on differential leucocyte count and CHD derived
from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) and the
NHANES 1 Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) involving 4625 individuals followed,
on average, for 18 years. The NHEFS involved 914 incident CHD cases and yielded an
adjusted risk ratio of 1.09 (0.93­1.29) comparing individuals with neutrophil counts in
the top third versus those in the bottom third of the population. In a meta-analysis in-
volving the NHEFS and four other studies comprising a total of 1764 incident CHD cases,
the association of CHD with neutrophil counts was somewhat stronger than those with
other specific leucocyte components (combined risk ratio ¼ 1.33 [1.17­1.50]) but there
was substantial heterogeneity between the separate studies (v2

¼ 18:0, p < 0:001).
Conclusions Although the present synthesis provides the most comprehensive assess-
ment so far of specific leucocyte components in CHD, additional prospective data will be
needed to resolve whether neutrophil counts are much stronger predictors of CHD risk
than other components.

Introduction
The idea that atherosclerosis may, in part, be an inflam-
matory disease is supported by the presence of mononu-
clear cells in arterial lesions1 and by the ability of
leucocyte counts to predict vascular disease. A meta-
analysis of prospective studies, has reported that peoplein
the top third of baseline total leucocyte counts have about
a 40% (95% CI: 30­50%) increased risk of coronary heart
disease (CHD) over the subsequent decade compared with
those in the bottom third of the population.2 The causal
relevance of this association, however, remains uncertain
because it is not clear to what extent the association of the
total leucocyte count with CHD risk merely reflects the
impact of established risk factors (such as cigarette
smoking), the extent of existing atherosclerosis, or both.

As leucocytes have such a wide range of biological effects,
some potentially protective against vascular disease and
some potentially damaging, identification of more specific
(and potentially stronger) associations between particular
components of the leucocyte count and CHD should help
elucidate the association. For example, a particular role
for neutrophils has been suggested by reports of strong
associations between risk of Myocardial infarction and
genetic determinants of 5-lipoxygenase activating pro-
tein, a pathway that includes products such as leukotriene
B4, which is produced by stimulated neutrophils.3
Available prospective data on differential leucocyte
counts and CHD are, however, limited and unsynthesised.
To help provide additional data and to clarify the existing
evidence we have (i) reported previously unpublished
data from the first National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS), (ii)
sought summary data from other prospective studies with
previously unpublished data on differential leucocyte
counts, and (iii) conducted a meta-analysis of these newly
available data in the context of the limited published
prospective data.
Methods
NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study
There were 9881 persons aged 25­74 years in the total NHANES I
sample, of which 6913 attended baseline interviews and exam-
inations in 1971­1975 and were eligible for the NHEFS4 (re-
sponse rate 70%). The NHEFS involved follow-up in four waves
during 1982­1984, 1986, 1987 and 1992.5 Incident CHD cases
were identified using routine data sources: death certificate
with underlying or non-underlying cause of death coded ICD-9
410­414 or one or more hospital stays during the follow-up
period with discharge diagnosis of ICD-9 410-414. Hospital dis-
charge summaries for the follow-up period were obtained from
any hospitals for which participants reported a stay. Cases were
counted only once, with the incidence date taken as the date of
first hospital stay, or the date of death for fatal CHD cases with
no prior record of hospitalisation. Blood samples were obtained
at baseline for differential leucocyte count in 6913 individuals.
Duplicate smears were made by the wedge technique from blood
preserved with EDTA. Five qualified medical laboratory techni-
cians counted 100 white blood cells using a microscope and re-
corded the white blood cell type using published cell-typing
criteria.6­10 In addition to the 358 (5.2%) individuals lost to
follow-up, the statistical analysis excluded 80 (1.2%) individuals
from racial groups other than "white" and "black", 1448 persons
with unknown baseline leucocyte count, systolic blood pressure,
serum cholesterol, diabetes history, number of cigarettes
smoked or body mass index, four persons with extreme leuco-
cyte counts (>18,000 cells/mm3), and 398 persons with a posi-
tive history of heart disease at baseline, leaving 4625 individuals
in the present analysis. Incidence rates were calculated as
number of CHD cases divided by total person years expressed in
thousands. Hazard ratios were derived from Cox proportional
hazards regression models using SAS statistical analysis software
(PHREG procedure).11 There was some evidence of violation of
the proportional hazards assumption in the full data set, but not
when the first 5 years of follow-up were excluded. But, as es-
timates were virtually identical by the two methods, results
over the full follow-up period are presented in detail, but any
differences between the adjusted estimates have been noted.
Multivariable models included age at baseline, gender, ethnic-
ity, recreational activity, educational level, systolic blood
pressure, serum cholesterol, body mass index and history of
diabetes. Sex-specific regression models and combined models
including interaction terms with sex were used in a subsidiary
analysis. All p-values quoted are derived from two-sided tests.
Meta-analysis
Prospective epidemiological studies of leucocyte count and CHD
with >1 year follow-up, published before January 2003, were
sought by computer-based searches scanning the reference lists
of all relevant studies and review articles, hand-searching of
relevant journals and correspondence with authors of studies.
Computer searches in Medline used keywords relating to leuco-
cytes (e.g., leucocyte, leukocyte, white blood cell, neutrophil,
eosinophil, basophil, monocyte, granulocyte, lymphocyte) in
combination with coronary heart disease (e.g., coronary heart
disease, isch[a]emic heart disease, vascular disease, myocardial
infarction and arteriosclerosis) and study design (e.g., prospec-
tive or cohort). All available studies that reported on differential
leucocyte counts in relation to CHD were included. In addition, we
corresponded with authors of all previously published prospective
studies of total leucocyte count to obtain, where available, tab-
ular data on differential leucocyte counts and CHD risk. The fol-
lowing information was abstracted from each study: geographical
location, study size, number and definition of CHD cases, assay (or
counting) method, mean age and percentage male cases, follow-
up duration sampling method, and degree of adjustment for po-
tential confounders. Adjustment as shown in the figure is denoted
as: þ þ þ for age, sex, smoking plus some other established
vascular risk factors; þ þ þ þ for these plus markers of socio-
economic status; þ þ þ þ þ for these plus evidence of pre-ex-
isting vascular disease. In studies with published results on
differential leucocyte counts we corresponded with investigators
to check our estimates and seek tabular data on the most up-to-
date results. Results were expressed as the adjusted log risk ratio
between individuals in the top third of the distribution of the
leucocyte component count and those in the bottom third of
disease-free individuals. Where this log risk ratio (and its stan-
dard error) was not available as a comparison of extreme thirds
from the published report or from correspondence with investi-
gators, it was estimated from the reported risk ratios (e.g., RR
per SD, per unit, or other comparisons, such as top and bottom
quarters) using log-linear scaling and assuming normality of the
leucocyte count distribution, as previously described.2 Fixed and
random effect summary estimates were calculated for each
leucocyte component. Heterogeneity between study estimates
was assessed by standard v2 tests,12 although potentially relevant
subgroup analyses (such as by age and sex) could not be reliably
investigated since individual data were not available in studies
other than the NHEFS. Results from studies with fewer than 50
incident CHD cases were treated separately in the analysis, but
combined for presentation in the figure. To make some allowance
for multiple comparisons, 99% confidence intervals were used.

male) and a median follow-up of 18.3 years. Table 1
provides a summary, by thirds of leucocyte components,
of crude CHD incidence per 1000 person-years and rate
ratios for CHD with increasing degrees of adjustment for
baseline values of some established vascular risk factors.
In age and sex only adjusted comparisons of leucocyte
values in the top third with those in the bottom third of
the control population, the rate ratios for CHD were
about 1.2­1.3 in people with higher counts of total leu-
cocytes, granulocytes (i.e., a combination of neutrophils,
eosinophils and basophils), neutrophils, or lymphocytes,
but each of these estimates were only moderately sta-
tistically significant. Further adjustment for baseline
levels of smoking and other established risk factors
weakened these associations to non-significance (Table
1). Similar results were obtained in subsidiary analyses
restricted to men and women separately, and there was
no significant interaction between sex and any individual
leucocyte component in fully adjusted analyses.
Meta analysis
Five published studies of differential leucocyte counts
and CHD were identified, plus two further cohorts (NHEFS
and the Bruneck Study13) with previously unpublished
findings. Overall, these studies involved a total of 1764
CHD cases with a weighted mean age at baseline of 57
years (55% male) and a mean follow-up of approximately
12 years (Table 2). Apart from a few dozen cases of angina
reported in two of the smaller studies,14;15 all CHD cases
involved either death, certified as due to coronary heart
disease (generally using ICD criteria) or confirmed non-
fatal myocardial infarction (generally using WHO crite-
ria). In a combined analysis of the top third versus the
bottom third of baseline leucocyte counts, the risk ratios
for CHD were 1.32 (95% CI: 1.15­1.51) and 1.33
(1.17­1.50) in those with higher granulocyte and neu-
trophil counts, respectively (Fig. 1). It should be noted
that these two risk ratios are not independent because, as
mentioned above, neutrophils are included in the granu-
locyte count. There was, however, substantial hetero-
geneity among the studies contributing to each of these
estimates (v2
4
¼ 18:0, p ¼ 0:001; v2
4
¼ 18:9, p ¼ 0:001,
respectively), with the majority due to differences be-
tween the two largest studies. Such heterogeneity implies
a need to factor greater uncertainty into the CI around
the overall relative risks than is provided by those above,
such as by use of a random effects model that takes ad-
ditional account of study variation (the risk ratios for CHD
were 1.51 [0.99­2.30] and 1.48 [1.02­2.15] under such a
model, in those with higher granulocyte and neutrophil
counts, respectively). Combined analyses of studies of
lymphocyte and monocyte counts yielded risk ratios
of 1.11 (0.99­1.25) and 1.10 (0.98­1.24), respectively,
which were of marginal statistical significance and
did not involve significant heterogeneity among the

Discussion
As it has been proposed that certain leucocyte compo-
nents, such as neutrophils, are particularly relevant to
atherosclerosis,13­15;17­19 prospective epidemiological
data on differential leucocyte counts should help to clarify
the nature of the associations previously observed be-
tween the total leucocyte count and CHD risk.2 The pres-
ent meta-analysis of 1764 incident cases of CHD from
seven long-term prospective studies, involving a total of
30,374 participants, provides the most comprehensive
assessment so far of the potential impact of differential
leucocyte counts on CHD.
The interpretation of the present evidence, however,
is complicated by potentially important differences in the
two largest studies, which together comprise approxi-
mately 80% of the available CHD cases. Whereas there was
less scope for random error in the NHEFS results (since it
comprised the largest single study in the meta-analysis,
involving 914 incident CHD cases), likely imprecision in its
manual method of counting leucocytes (even with trained
laboratory staff) may have resulted in under-estimation of
the true associations between leucocyte components and
CHD. By contrast, the ARIC study, involving 527 incident
CHD cases used an automated leucocyte counter. More-
over, the ARIC study may have defined CHD more precisely
by using clinical review against standardised criteria to
supplement routine CHD ascertainment methods, whilst
the NHEFS relied on routine CHD ascertainment methods
alone. So, although confidence intervals were wider in the
ARIC study than those in NHEFS, the more extreme asso-
ciations observed in ARIC between elevated neutrophil
counts (and, hence, also granulocyte counts) and CHD risk
may have been related to its greater precision. By com-
parison, associations of CHD with lymphocyte and mono-
cyte counts observed in the present meta-analysis were
probably weaker than those for granulocyte and neutro-
phil counts (Fig. 1).
In summary, although our study indicates that neu-
trophil count may be a somewhat stronger predictor of
CHD risk than other leucocyte components, more reliable
quantification of its predictive ability will require fresh
evidence from prospective studies involving large num-
bers of CHD cases, with serial measurements of leuco-
cyte components using optimal assay methods, and
measurement of other inflammatory biomarkers.16 As it
is likely that the neutrophil count is, at best, only a
comparatively modest predictor of CHD in general pop-
ulations, there is a need for sufficiently powered studies,
to help assess the separate and combined impact of in-
flammatory markers on CHD risk.
