Abstract
Objective: The present study was performed to explore the therapeutic potential of simvastatin
in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the context of the Simvastatin in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid
Hemorrhage (STASH) trial.
Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for all randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the therapeutic effect of simvastatin on aneurysmal SAH.
We applied a random-effects model to calculate the data.
Results: Five RCTs involving 951 patients met the eligibility criteria. We found no statistically
significant effects on vasospasm detected by transcranial cerebral Doppler (relative risk [RR], 0.91;
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55­1.49), delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) (RR, 0.85; 95% CI,
0.63­1.14), or all-cause mortality (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.67­1.54). Subgroup analysis showed that
these consolidated results were stable at different doses, different times to start of treatment, and
different courses of treatment in all included RCTs. Sensitivity analysis showed that the STASH
trial, which had a large population, did not influence the consolidated results of all three outcomes.
Conclusions: Simvastatin showed no benefits in decreasing the incidence of vasospasm, DCI, or
all-cause mortality after aneurysmal SAH. We conclude that patients with SAH should not be
treated routinely with simvastatin during the acute stage.

early brain injury.1,2 Only nimodipine is
recommended to manage delayed vaso-
spasm according to current guidelines, but
this agent has limited efficacy.3 Therefore,
new drugs are required to improve the
outcome of patients with SAH.
Statins represent potential agents with
which to prevent delayed vasospasm.3
Animal studies have shown that statins can
reduce inflammation and decrease platelet
activation; however, they also increase the
expression of endothelial nitric oxide syn-
thase.4 All of these effects can prevent
delayed vasospasm.4 Simvastatin is con-
sidered to be more lipophilic and have a
higher blood­brain barrier permeability
than other statins.5 At the same dose,
simvastatin has twice the cholesterol-low-
ering effect of pravastatin.5 Therefore, sim-
vastatin has become the main research target
in detecting the efficacy of statins on vaso-
spasm and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI)
after aneurysmal SAH. To date, five rando-
mized controlled trials (RCTs)6­10 have
been performed to detect the benefit of
simvastatin over placebo based on the use
of nimodipine. Unfortunately, the results of
these clinical trials were inconsistent. Two
phase II RCTs have shown a potential
benefit of simvastatin therapy with respect
to lower rates of radiologic vasospasm, DCI,
and even mortality.6,7 However, two other
phase II RCTs revealed opposite results:
simvastatin showed no significant effects on
the rates of vasospasm, DCI, and mortal-
ity.8,9 All of these studies were single-center,
phase II studies with small samples of fewer
than 100 patients. Therefore, it is difficult
to draw a credible conclusion. Lancet
Neurology recently published a large multi-
center phase III RCT (Simvastatin in
Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
[STASH] trial) investigating the benefit of
simvastatin in patients with aneurysmal
SAH.10 The results showed that simvastatin
treatment (40 mg/day, on 96 h of the ictus
for up to 21 days) had no beneficial effect on
the modified Rankin scale score or DCI of
patients with SAH at discharge or 6 months
later, which was questioned for using low-
dose simvastatin at 40 mg/day. Another
RCT verified the hypothesis that high-dose
simvastatin might improve the clinical out-
comes after aneurysmal SAH.11 We per-
formed a meta-analysis to determine
whether simvastatin plays a beneficial role
in reducing delayed vasospasm, DCI, and
mortality after aneurysmal SAH.
Methods
Study protocol
The present study protocol was drafted
following the Cochrane Collaboration
format prior to study initiation. This proto-
col contained the patients' background
information, a flow diagram, the search
strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria,
outcome definitions, the statistical design,
the methods of determining the risk of bias,
and the discussion. We also conducted a
clear division of labor and reached a con-
sensus about the solution of controversy
during performing this meta-analysis. The
meta-analysis was performed in accordance
with the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis
(PRISMA) statement.12 Ethical approval
was not required because the meta-analysis
was conducted using published data.
Information sources and search
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane
Library were searched by two independent
authors (J.H.L. and H.X.L.). The main
search strategy involved the combination of
the variables ``simvastatin'' AND ``subarach-
noid hemorrhage.'' Searches were restricted
to the English language and matched the
titles and abstracts of studies. To insure that
all relevant studies were included in this
systematic review, the reference lists of the
RCTs and systematic reviews were manually
Lin et al. 2129
screened in addition to performing the elec-
tronic database search. Appendix 1 provides
the full details of the search strategy.
Eligibility criteria, study selection, and data
collection
Double-blind RCTs were included if they met
the following criteria: i) patients had aneur-
ysmal SAH diagnosed by computed tomog-
raphy angiography or digital subtraction
angiography, ii) simvastatin was regularly
administered during the initial 2 to 3 weeks
following SAH, and iii) outcomes of interest
were compared between the simvastatin and
placebo groups. Studies assessing outcomes
based on simvastatin use prior to aneurysm
rupture were excluded. Outcomes of interest
based on intention-to-treat datasets included
vasospasm detected by transcranial cerebral
Doppler (TCD), the incidence of DCI, and
all-cause mortality. DCI was assessed by
clinical scales or cerebral angiography.
The following data were extracted: study
characteristics (such as lead author, publi-
cation year, and study setting), participant
characteristics (such as diagnostic criteria,
sex, age, and type of operation), intervention
details (such as dose ranges, time to treat-
ment from SAH, and follow-up time), and
outcome measures.
Risk of bias and quality assessment
Biases in the included trials were assessed
by two independent investigators (J.L. and
H.L.) using a seven-point quality control
scale recommended by the Cochrane
Handbook.13 The items included selection
bias, performance bias, detection bias, attri-
tion bias, reporting bias, and other potential
biases. Each item was categorized as high,
low, or unclear risk. The GRADE approach,
which contains five items (risk of bias,
inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and
publication bias), was used to assess the
quality of the evidence.
Data analysis
Data were processed using Review Manager
5.2 from the Cochrane Collaboration.
Dichotomous outcomes were analyzed as
the risk ratio (relative risk [RR] and 95%
confidence interval [CI]) using the Mantel­
Haenszel technique and a random-effects
model. Statistical heterogeneity was estimated
by the I2 statistic. Tests were two-tailed, and
P < 0.05 was considered statistically signifi-
cant in all analyses. All analyses were per-
formed on an intention-to-treat basis.
Results
According to the initially established search
strategy, 738 records were retrieved from
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane
Library. After removing duplicates, irrele-
vant records, and non-RCTs, 17 full-text
articles were assessed for eligibility. Among
them, 12 records were excluded for the
following reasons: secondary analysis of
previously published RCTs, meta-analysis
review, and RCT without a placebo-control
group. Ultimately, 5 RCTs involving 951
patients were included in the qualitative
analysis (Figure 1). The main character-
istics of the included studies are listed
in Table 1.
Outcomes analysis
Four trials6­9 involving 148 patients were
available for analysis of vasospasm de-
tected by TCD. No statistically significant
effect on vasospasm detected by TCD was
observed between the simvastatin and pla-
cebo groups (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.55­1.49)
(Figure 2(a)). Data heterogeneity was
apparent due to various definitions of
vasospasm detected by TCD (I2 ¼ 53.0%,
P ¼ 0.09) (Figure 2(a)). The quality of the
evidence was very low.
Five studies6­10 involving 951 patients
were available for analysis of the incidence
of DCI. Simvastatin showed no statistically
2130 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
significant effect on reducing DCI (RR, 0.85;
95% CI, 0.63­1.14) (Figure 2(b)). No data
heterogeneity was observed (I2 ¼ 12.0%)
(Figure 2(b)). The quality of the evidence
was moderate.
Four studies7­10 involving 912 patients
were available for analysis of all-cause mor-
tality. Simvastatin did not decrease all-cause
mortality (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.67­1.54)
(Figure 2(c)). No evidence existed for data
heterogeneity (I2 ¼ 0%) (Figure 2(c)). The
quality of the evidence was moderate.
Subgroup analysis
A subgroup analysis was performed to detect
the influence of different drug doses, different
times to start of treatment, and different
courses of treatment in the included RCTs.
With respect to drug dose, four studies6­9
used simvastatin at 80 mg/day and one
study10 used simvastatin at 40mg/day (details
in Table 1). No differences were observed in
vasospasm detected by TCD, DCI, or all-
cause mortality (details in Table 2) between
the high- and low-dose groups. With respect

to the times to start of treatment, three
studies7,9,10 started simvastatin therapy
within 96 h and the other two studies6,8
started simvastatin therapy within 72 or
48 h (details in Table 1). No differences
in vasospasm detected by TCD, DCI,
or all-cause mortality were observed between
the two subgroups (details in Table 2).
Finally, with respect to the course of treat-
ment, two studies7,10 continued for 21 days
and the other three studies6,8,9 continued for
14 days (details in Table 1). No differences in
vasospasm detected by TCD, DCI, or all-
cause mortality were observed between the
two subgroups (details in Table 2). No
evidence existed for data heterogeneity. The
quality of the evidence was moderate.
Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis was necessary to detect
the stability of the consolidated results
among the included studies because of their
various definitions of outcomes and different
sample sizes. The sensitivity analysis showed
that the STASH trial, which had a large
population, did not influence the consoli-
dated results of all three outcomes (Table 2).
The quality of this evidence was moderate.
Risk of bias in included studies
The risk of bias with respect to allocation
concealment was unclear in two studies.6,7
The risk of bias with respect to blinding of
the outcome assessment was unclear in four
studies.6­9 The risk of bias with respect to
selective reporting was high in one study.6
No other items showed a high risk of bias
(Figure 3).
Discussion
Simvastatin, as the most potentially effective
statin in the treatment of SAH, has been
investigated for several years.14 However,
the efficacy of simvastatin in clinical practice
remains controversial because of the lack of
large multicenter prospective clinical trials.
The recent STASH trail, which was expected
to provide strong evidence for simvastatin in
the treatment of SAH, revealed discoura-
ging results in the Lancet Neurology.10 These
results exacerbated the debate. The present
meta-analysis has shown that simvastatin
does not have significant effects on vaso-
spasm detected by TCD, DCI, or all-cause
mortality. Further subgroup analysis
showed that these consolidated results were

stable at different drug doses, different times
to the start of treatment, and different
courses of treatment in the included RCTs.
Sensitivity analysis showed that the STASH
trial, which had a large population, did not
affect the consolidated results of all three
outcomes. These results indicate that sim-
vastatin has no benefit in decreasing the
incidence of vasospasm, DCI, and all-cause
mortality after aneurysmal SAH.
Cerebral vasospasm is responsible for the
poor prognosis of aneurysmal SAH.15
Approximately 50% of patients with large
arterial vasospasm eventually develop DCI,
which is associated with a high mortality
rate.16,17 Thus, the low incidence of cerebral
vasospasm and DCI is considered to predict
good functional recovery. In the present
study, simvastatin had no significant effect
on either vasospasm detected by TCD or
DCI. Our findings are consistent with those
of previous studies. To date, five retrospect-
ive studies,18­22 one prospective cohort
study,23 and five RCTs6­10 have evaluated
Figure 3. Summary of risk of bias in each study.
Lin et al. 2135
the efficacy of simvastatin on the incidence
of vasospasm or DCI. Only one retrospect-
ive study18 and one RCT6 reported a
decrease in vasospasm by simvastatin, but
the study results were questionable due to
several limitations. For example, Lynch
et al.6 reported a high rate of vasospasm in
their placebo group (60%), while the inci-
dence of vasospasm in the simvastatin group
was 26%, which is comparable with the
incidence without treatment in a previous
study.24 This unrepresentative placebo
group made the statistical analysis meaning-
less. Mortality is regarded as the most serious
outcome of aneurysmal SAH, and it is usu-
ally analyzed to determine the acceptability
and safety of treatment. Notably, however,
the present study evaluated all-cause mortal-
ity, which cannot reflect the acceptability of
simvastatin for SAH. Further studies are
needed to classify the cause of mortality.
Several confounding factors may lead to
heterogeneity, such as vasospasm measure-
ment technique, DCI diagnosis, and thera-
peutic regimen; however, these factors are
unlikely to have influenced our results. TCD
was regarded as the most common technique
with which to detect vasospasm by measure-
ment of the middle cerebral artery velocity.
Four of the five studies in this meta-analysis
used three definitions of vasospasm: any peak
systolic middle cerebral artery velocity of
>120,8 >160,6,9 or >2007 cm/s. However, the
subgroup analysis showed that the consoli-
dated results were stable (data not shown).
The difficulty in diagnosing DCI is another
confounding factor. Although emerging data
showed that perfusion magnetic resonance
imaging has high accuracy for identification
of DCI,25 its high costs have restricted its
wide application. The five RCTs in this meta-
analysis employed several neurological exam-
inations to detect the incidence of DCI with a
similar relevance ratio. We performed sub-
group analyses according to the drug dose,
time to the start of treatment, and course of
treatment to detect the influence of the
various therapeutic regimens. The STASH
trial was questionable because of its half-dose
of simvastatin (40 mg/day) compared with
the other four RCTs (80 mg/day), and this
difference was regarded to influence the
efficacy of simvastatin. The present subgroup
analysis showed no efficacy of simvastatin at
either 80mg/day or 40mg/day in reducing
vasospasm, DCI, or all-cause mortality.
Moreover, a recent trial also showed no
superiority of high-dose (80 mg/day) com-
pared with lower-dose (40 mg/day) simvasta-
tin treatment for patients with aneurysmal
SAH.11 The different times to the start of
treatment and various durations of simvas-
tatin are also unlikely to influence the con-
solidated results. Cerebral vasospasm most
frequently occurred 7 to 10 days after aneur-
ysm rupture and resolved spontaneously
after 21 days.3 Although three RCTs only
provided simvastatin for 14 days,6,8,26 this is
sufficient time to prevent the incidence of
cerebral vasospasm. Similarly, the time to the
start of treatment in the included RCTs
ranged from 48h to 96h, which was prior
to the onset of cerebral vasospasm. The
results of the subgroup analysis also indicate
that the time to the start of treatment and
duration of simvastatin had no influence on
the stability of the consolidated results.
There were several limitations in our
analysis. First, the present systematic
review included only 4 small RCTs involving
148 patients and the STASH trial involving
803 patients. The small sample is an import-
ant limitation in the present meta-analysis,
although the sensitivity analysis showed that
the STASH trial with its large population
did not influence the consolidated results of
all three outcomes. Second, the treatment
mode for ruptured aneurysms may have
played an important role in the final out-
comes. Surgical treatments might cause the
subarachnoid blood clots to fill both lateral
ventricles, leading to worse outcomes after
SAH.27 Finally, the severity of the patients'
conditions at the time of recruitment was
2136 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
inconsistent among the RCTs. Thus, the
efficacy of simvastatin in patients with severe
SAH might have been neglected.
Conclusion
Simvastatin showed no benefits in decreasing
the incidence of vasospasm, DCI, or all-cause
mortality after aneurysmal SAH. Routine
prescription of simvastatin for aneurysmal
SAH might not be beneficial. Further studies
are needed to explore the mechanism of
simvastatin's neuroprotective effect. A multi-
center prospective study of simvastatin for
patients with SAH involving a large sample
size and long-term follow-up is still needed.
