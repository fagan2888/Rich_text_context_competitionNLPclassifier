Built and socioeconomic environments: patterning
and associations with physical activity in U.S.
adolescents
Janne Boone-Heinonen1, Kelly R Evenson2, Yan Song3 and Penny Gordon-Larsen*1
Abstract
Background: Inter-relationships among built and socioeconomic environmental characteristics may result in
confounding of associations between environment exposure measures and health behaviors or outcomes, but
traditional multivariate adjustment can be inappropriate due to collinearity.
Methods: We used principal factor analysis to describe inter-relationships between a large set of Geographic
Information System-derived built and socioeconomic environment measures for adolescents in the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Wave I, 1995-96, n = 17,294). Using resulting factors in sex-stratified
multivariate negative binomial regression models, we tested for confounding of associations between built and
socioeconomic environment characteristics and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Finally, we used
knowledge gained from factor analysis to construct replicable environmental measures that account for inter-
relationships and avoid collinearity.
Results: Using factor analysis, we identified three built environment constructs [(1) homogenous landscape; 2)
development intensity with high pay facility count; 3) development intensity with high public facility count] and two
socioeconomic environment constructs [1) advantageous economic environment, 2) disadvantageous social
environment]. In regression analysis, confounding of built environment-MVPA associations by socioeconomic
environment factors was stronger than among built environment factors. In fully adjusted models, MVPA was
negatively associated with the highest (versus lowest) quartile of homogenous land cover in males [exp(coeff) (95%
CI): 0.91 (0.86, 0.96)] and intensity (pay facilities) [exp(coeff) (95% CI): 0.92 (0.85, 0.99)] in females. Single proxy measures
(Simpson's diversity index, count of pay facilities, count of public facilities, median household income, and crime rate)
representing each environmental construct replicated associations with MVPA.
Conclusions: Environmental characteristics are inter-related. Both built and SES environments should be incorporated
into analysis in order to minimize confounding. Single environmental measures may be useful proxies for
environmental constructs in longitudinal analysis and replication in external populations, but more research is needed
to better understand mechanisms of action, and ultimately identify policy-relevant environmental determinants of
physical activity.
Introduction
Numerous aspects of the built environment such as phys-
ical activity facilities (e.g., parks, recreation centers) [1,2],
"walkability" [3,4], and neighborhood socioeconomic sta-
tus (SES) [5-7] are related to physical activity and other
key health behaviors and outcomes [8-10]. However, built
and SES environments are theoretically and empirically
correlated; for example, physical activity facilities are
more common in wealthier neighborhoods [11] and
streets may be more connected in the poor inner-city
[12]. Therefore, neighborhood health studies that exam-
ine single or narrow sets of environmental characteristics
are vulnerable to confounding by other environmental
variables.

Strong correlations among environmental measures
may also result in collinearity, thus precluding extensive
covariate adjustment. Pattern analysis techniques such as
factor analysis is a common strategy for overcoming col-
linearity and accounting for potentially interactive effects
of environmental characteristics [12-16], but are limited
in that they are data-driven and population specific. Fur-
ther, extant replicable "walkability" and "urban sprawl"
indices [17,18] do not incorporate other potentially
important environmental features such as facilities [2,11].
Finally, most work has been in constrained geographic
areas [18] or has used large geographic units such as
counties [17].
While correlations between neighborhood SES and
built environment characteristics may result from com-
plex and dynamic relationships, they may also reflect
independent clustering of characteristics in space. For
example, a suburban neighborhood may exhibit low
street connectivity and higher SES, but low street con-
nectivity does not necessarily result from having more
social and financial resources. Therefore, we conceptual-
ize the built and SES environments as independent influ-
ences on physical activity, which allows comparison of
built and SES environments and separation of more mod-
ifiable built environment from less modifiable SES envi-
ronment factors.
Using nationally representative data on US adolescents,
a group at risk for dramatic decline in physical activity
[19,20], we sought to: (1) describe inter-relationships
between a large set of built and SES environment mea-
sures in a nationally representative sample of adolescents,
(2) quantify the extent to which inter-related environ-
ment measures confound associations with moderate to
vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and (3) demonstrate a
strategy for using pattern analysis results to construct
replicable environment measures that accounts for inter-
relationships and avoids collinearity.
Methods
Study population and data sources
We used cross-sectional Wave I data from The National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a
cohort study of 20,745 adolescents representative of the
U.S. school-based population in grades 7 to 12 (11-22
years of age) in 1994-95. Add Health included a core sam-
ple plus subsamples of selected minority and other
groupings collected under protocols approved by the
Institutional Review Board at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. The survey design and sampling
frame are described elsewhere [21].
Neighborhood-level variables were created using a
Geographic Information System (GIS) that links commu-
nity-level data to Add Health respondent residential loca-
tions in space and time. Residential locations for
adolescents in the probability sample (n = 18,924) were
determined from the following sources, in order of prior-
ity: (1) geocoded home addresses with street-segment
matches (n = 15,480), (2) global positioning system (GPS)
measurements (n = 2,996), (3) ZIP/ZIP+4/ZIP+2 cen-
troid match (n = 205), (4) respondent's geocoded school
location (n = 243). Residential locations were linked to
attributes of the circular area within 1 and 3 kilometers
(k) of each respondent residence (Euclidean neighbor-
hood buffer), block group, tract, and county attributes
from U.S. Census and other federal sources, and Add
Health survey data.
To facilitate national representation of adolescent
neighborhood environments, missing environmental data
(n = 630, 3.3%) was the only exclusion criterion for envi-
ronmental patterning analyses, resulting in 18,294 ado-
lescents. In estimating associations with MVPA,
exclusions included self-reported pregnancy (n = 401) or
mobility disability (n = 122) and Native Americans due to
small sample size (n = 156); of the remaining sample
(18,248), those with missing analytic variables (n = 359
missing individual-level variables, 578 missing environ-
mental variables, 17 missing both) were also excluded for
an analytical sample of 17,294 adolescents.
Study variables
GIS-derived environmental characteristics
We examined built and SES environment measures with
conceptual relevance or evidence of physical activity rela-
tionships in existing literature; see Table 1 for variable
definitions and data sources and additional details below.
We defined neighborhoods (e.g., 1 or 3 k buffer, or Cen-
sus tracts) consistent with the strongest associations with
MVPA in prior analysis (Boone-Heinonen J, Gordon-Lar-
sen P, Song Y, Popkin BM: What is the relevant neighbor-
hood area for detecting built environment relationships
with physical activity?, submitted).
We obtained PA facility counts from a historical data-
set of U.S. businesses with high overall agreement
between commercial and field data [22] and classified
according to 8-digit Standard Industrial Classification
codes into overlapping types (Table 1). Measures of land-
scape diversity and complexity [23] were created from
national land cover data using Fragstats software [24].
Using classical graph theory [25], we created street con-
nectivity measures reflecting the number and directness
of route options [26]. We classified population density
using census population counts within 1 k buffers
weighted according to the proportion of the block-group
area captured within 1 k, divided by buffer area.
SES environment measures included economic
(median household income; proportion of persons below
poverty, college degree or greater) and social (crime rate;

environment characteristics.
Individual-level self-reported behaviors and
sociodemographics
MVPA was ascertained using a standard, interview
administered, 7-item activity recall based on question-
naires validated in other epidemiologic studies [27-29].
Three items corresponding with MVPA (skating &
cycling, exercise, and active sports) were summed to yield
total weekly frequency (bouts) of MVPA. Individual-level
sociodemographic control variables included age at Wave
I interview, self-identified race (white, black, Asian, His-
panic), parent-reported annual household income and
highest level of education (<high school, high school or
GED, some college, college degree), and administra-
tively determined U.S. region (West, Midwest, South,
Northeast). Distributions of these variables in the analyti-
cal sample are reported in the Appendix (see Table A1;
additional file 1).
Statistical analysis
Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)
We used EFA to describe inter-relationships across a
large set of built and SES environment characteristics
(Table 1). We used the principal factors estimator
because it did not impose distributional constraints,
oblique rotation (oblimin, gamma = 0) because environ-
mental constructs are theoretically and empirically corre-
lated, and Kaiser Criterion (Eigenvalue > 1), scree plots,
and interpretability to determine the number of factors.
Variables with weak loadings (<0.4) on all factors and
variables of interest with substantial cross-loadings (>0.3)
were removed from the EFA model. If two or fewer vari-
ables loaded strongly on a single factor, corresponding
variables were removed from analysis. To address nega-
tive Eigenvalues, percent variance explained by each fac-
tor was calculated using the trace of the correlation
matrix as the divisor [30]. EFA of SES environment vari-
ables was conducted separately using the same proce-
dure.
Regression analysis
We fit two sets of regression models to estimate the rela-
tionships (1) among the resulting built and SES environ-
ment factors and (2) between the built and SES
environment factors and MVPA. Because street connec-
tivity measures did not load onto factors but were rele-
vant to our analysis, we examined one index (alpha) as a
single variable in our models that was not highly corre-
lated with the built environment factors.
Buffer-based measures are individual-level variables.
While census tracts and counties could comprise a sec-
ond level in multi-level analysis, they are not nested
within schools, the primary sampling unit and a more
important source of clustering. Additionally, our data
were sparse and unbalanced (mean = 8, range = 1-275
respondents per census tract), so multilevel analysis may
have produced biased estimates [31]. Intraclass correla-
tions for ln(MVPA) were minimal (0.03; ICC's are not
definable for Poisson distributed outcomes). We there-
fore used single-level regression models, which corrected
for complex survey sampling and were weighted for
national representation.
We conducted all statistical analyses in Stata version
10.1. First, in a descriptive analysis examining the associ-
ation between built and SES environments, we used
crude linear regression to model each built environment
factor and street connectivity (alpha index) as a function
of SES environment factor quartiles. Second, to investi-
gate confounding of built environment-MVPA associa-
tions by other environment variables, we fit a series of
negative binomial regression models estimating weekly
MVPA bouts as a function of built environment factor
quartiles, controlling for cumulative sets of variables in
Models 1-3: Model 1 included individual-level sociode-
mographic variables and one built environment factor or
alpha; Model 2 added all three built environment factors
and alpha; Model 3 added a 1-dimensional SES environ-
ment factor. In Model 4, a 2-dimensional SES environ-
ment construct replaced the 1-dimensional factor.
Models were sex-stratified due to sex differences in phys-
ical activity determinants [32].

To account for non-linear relationships, we examined
quartiles of the environment factors and measures. In
contrast to continuous variables with higher-order terms,
quartiles facilitated comparability with parallel analysis
using single measures representing each factor (described
below). For interpretability, results are reported as expo-
nentiated coefficients, representing the proportion
increase in MVPA bouts compared to the lowest quartile.
Confounding was objectively defined using a >±20%
percent change in coefficient criterion [100*(current
model-previous model)/previous model]; Models 3 and 4
were compared to Model 2. Because large percent
changes reflect negligible absolute changes when coeffi-
cients are very small, our confounding definition was
more stringent than the conventional 10% change thresh-
old. Additionally, percent change was not reported if
coefficients remained within ±0.04, corresponding to the
approximate magnitude of marginally statistically signifi-
cant coefficients.
As suggested by Riitters and colleagues [33], we evalu-
ated single environmental measures (guided by strength
of factor loadings and conceptual considerations) that
could potentially serve as proxies for their respective con-
structs by replicating Models 1-4 above using single mea-
sures representing each factor. We selected Simpson's
diversity index to represent the homogenous landscape
factor. For the intensity factors, the counts of each type of
facility were unstable, so non-overlapping pay facility
types (instruction, member, and public fee) were
summed. For public facilities, public (rather than youth)
facilities were selected due to relevance across age
groups. Because the preceding analyses suggested that
resource counts represented general density of develop-
ment, we separated the availability of resources from den-
sity by using alternative facilities variables calculated as
the number of facilities per 1,000 population in Model 5.
Results
Patterning of the built and socioeconomic environments
The variability of built and SES environment measures
included in the final factor solutions and subsequent
analyses (Table 2) demonstrate the geographic diversity
of the Add Health population. Percentile values and
larger mean (versus median) values illustrate the right-
skewed distribution of many measures.
Built environment measures were inter-correlated,
loading onto three factors explaining 70.9% of variation
(Table 3). Landscape variables loaded onto a single homo-
geneous landscape factor (high scores indicate non-
diverse landscape) and two development intensity factors
representing the degree of high intersection and popula-
tion density and counts of either pay or public physical
activity facilities (high scores indicate high development
intensity). Conceptually, we expected correlation among
facilities counts and density variables, so population and
intersection density were retained despite cross-loadings.
Unweighted correlations with homogeneous landscape
were -0.03 and -0.02 for intensity (pay facilities) and
intensity (public facilities), respectively; and 0.58 between
the two intensity factors. Other street connectivity indi-
ces did not load onto any factors and were therefore
removed from factor analysis.
Two SES environment factors (Table 4) (unweighted
correlation -0.49; 55.7% of variation explained) were con-
sistent with our theorized constructs: one represented
advantageous economic environment (high scores indi-
cate low poverty, high college and median household
income), the other represented characteristics typically
associated with less desirable health outcomes (disadvan-
tageous social environment; high scores indicate high pro-
portion of racial/ethnic minorities and renters and high
crime). Because the second factor marginally met inclu-
sion criteria (Eigenvalue = 0.83), a 1-dimensional SES fac-
tor was also examined (41.9% of variation explained).
Relationship between built and SES environments
Using factor scores generated from factor analysis, we
examined built environment constructs within quartiles
of the 2-dimensional SES environment constructs. Built
environment factors or alpha street connectivity index
(analyzed as a single variable because street connectivity
variables were not derived into the final factor solution)
varied across quartiles of SES factors (Table 5). The two
SES environment factors were inversely related, but posi-
tively associated with the intensity factors. SES factors
were negatively associated with less homogeneous land-
scape, whereas the disadvantageous social environment
factor was positively associated with connectivity.
MVPA and built and SES environment factor scores:
associations and confounding
Next, we examined MVPA as a function of built and SES
environment factor scores. By sequentially adjusting for
additional variables in Models 1 through 4, we tested for
confounding by different sets of environmental charac-
teristics, quantified by the percent change in coefficients.
In males, models adjusted for individual-level sociode-
mographics (Table 6, Model 1) showed that weekly
MVPA bouts were 8% lower for males living in areas with
the highest versus lowest landscape homogeneity score
quartile. Analogous results for females showed relation-
ships counter to theory: compared to the lowest quartiles,
the highest intensity (pay facilities) and alpha street con-
nectivity index quartiles were associated with 7% and 8%
lower MVPA bouts, respectively (Table 7, Model 1).
While inclusion of all four built environment measures
indicated confounding by other built environment fea-
tures according to our objective definition, the absolute

change in estimates were small (Tables 6 &7, Model 1 vs.
2).
SES environment factors were also related to MVPA,
with up to 7% higher MVPA for the highest versus lowest
SES factor quartile in fully adjusted models (Tables 6 &7,
Models 3 & 4). Comparison of Model 2 to Models 3 and 4
indicated confounding of MVPA associations with alpha
and, in females, intensity (public facilities) by SES envi-
ronment measures. The 2-dimensional SES factor (Model
3) influenced these associations to a greater extent than
the 1-dimensional SES factor (Model 4), although abso-
lute changes in estimates were small. The significant built
environment-MVPA associations were otherwise rela-
tively robust.
MVPA and built and SES environment single measures:
setting the stage for longitudinal settings and external
study populations
Because factors are data-driven and population specific,
we used knowledge gained from factor analysis to iden-
tify measures replicable in future research. Associations
between MVPA and representative indicator measures
(selected as per Methods, and flagged in Tables 3 &4) in
Tables 8 &9 (Models 2 & 4) are generally consistent with
corresponding factor score-MVPA associations, suggest-
ing that the single measures adequately represent the
underlying construct.
The emergence of "intensity" factors suggests that facil-
ity counts may reflect a general density of development

and resources. Model 5 used alternative facilities vari-
ables scaled by population, either attenuating or magnify-
ing facilities-MVPA associations.
Discussion
Neighborhood environments that may encourage or dis-
courage physical activity are complex and multidimen-
sional, but most existing research examines single or only
a few aspects of the environment. Our study shows inter-
relatedness of environmental characteristics in a nation-
ally representative adolescent population and reveals sev-
eral patterns of built and SES environments reflecting
constructs consistent with research in adult populations.
Further, correlations among environment characteristics

resulted in confounding to estimated associations with

ronmental influences on physical activity.
Insights about the environment gained from pattern
analysis
Our factor analysis identified inter-relationships among
environmental measures too tightly correlated to analyze
simultaneously as individual measures, while less inter-
correlated environmental characteristics can be analyzed
using traditional multivariate methods.
Inseparability of environmental features
In existing research, single environment measures are
often examined as indicators of isolated environment
characteristics. For example, intersection density is a
common measure of street connectivity [18,34-36], and
facilities counts are often used to indicate access to
resources. However, dense, gridded streets are common
in city centers [37], which represent a multitude of built,
socioeconomic, and other features, and it is intuitive that
more physical activity facilities are located in otherwise
densely developed areas. Indeed, Cervero and colleagues
[16] introduced the concept of intensity, representing
dense population and resources and interpreted as a mea-
sure of density. Consistent with this conceptualization,
our study demonstrated that counts of physical activity
facilities were strongly linked with population and inter-
section density, suggesting that it is important to adjust
for density in estimation of physical activity facilities'
effects. Yet statistical adjustment may be inappropriate
due to strong correlation between density measures and
facilities counts. Instead, we found that ratios of physical
activity facilities per 1,000 population was a useful strat-
egy for separating density from count of facilities, similar
to Diez Roux and colleagues [2].
In contrast, other street connectivity measures did not
load onto factors in our study, indicating that they were
not strongly correlated with each other or with other
aspects of the built environment. Our results contrast
with other studies showing constructs with multiple con-
nectivity index indicators [12,14]. This discrepancy may
be explained by the national scope of Add Health as
opposed to one or more metropolitan areas in the studies
noted. Connectivity indices are ratios of various compo-
nents such as number of intersections, street segments,
and route alternatives, so they may reflect different con-
structs in areas with high versus low component values.
Likewise, Ewing et al [17] reported a single principal
component representing urban sprawl characterized by
residential density, land use mix, and street accessibility
in a national sample, but their study was also limited to
metropolitan areas and used block size measures rather
than connectivity indices to represent street accessibility.
Alternatively, our buffer-defined areas may influence
intersection and street segment counts, particularly in
rural areas with few streets, altering the meaning of the
connectivity indices.
Dimensionality of environmental constructs
Factor solutions distinguished dimensions of similar con-
structs, which in turn were differentially related to
MVPA. Factor analysis identified two types of facilities
which were related to MVPA in different ways. For exam-

ple, in females, MVPA was negatively associated with
intensity (pay facilities) but marginally positively associ-
ated with intensity (public facilities) in fully adjusted
models. Likewise, two SES environment factors emerged,
one reflecting economic and education characteristics,
the other reflecting social characteristics. These factors
were correlated but appear to be differentially related to
the built environment and MVPA.
Importance of incorporating many aspects of the
environment when estimating neighborhood effects on
physical activity
Factors allowed a wide range of environmental measures
to be simultaneously incorporated into the analysis,
revealing confounding by SES and built environment
characteristics:
Confounding by SES environment characteristics
In particular, built and SES factors were strongly associ-
ated, and adjustment for SES environment factor(s)
resulted in changes to several built environment-MVPA
associations. Further, the 2-dimensional SES environ-
ment construct was a stronger confounder of associations
between MVPA and intensity (public facilities) and, to a
lesser extent, street connectivity, compared to the 1-
dimensional construct. Such confounding could reflect
placement of public facilities in areas of greatest need.
Likewise, high street connectedness is common in poor
inner-city areas where physical activity may be influenced
by social contexts particularly relevant to females such as
crime [38], which is better captured by the 2-dimensional
SES environment construct.
These results support our conceptualization of the SES
environment as a confounder of the built environment-
MVPA association. However, relationships between the
built and SES environments may be bidirectional and
dynamic. For example, crime may mediate, rather than
confound, relationships between built and SES environ-
ment measures and physical activity. Furthermore, the
social and economic resources of a community may influ-
ence where built environment features are situated, social
norms with regard to health behavior [39], and perceived
and objective safety; ultimately, the SES environment
measures may be surrogates for a multitude of influences
on MVPA. While future research should investigate and
account for these complexities, examination of the SES
and built environments as independent influences on
MVPA is valuable for documenting SES disparities and
investigating the potential benefits of modifying the built
environment while accounting for inter-correlation with
the less modifiable SES environment.
Confounding by built environment characteristics
While built environment characteristics met our objec-
tive definition of confounding, absolute changes to esti-
mates were small and did not change study conclusions
regarding the relationship between the built environment
and MVPA. One possible explanation for weak confound-
ing is that our built environment factors were multidi-
mensional and account for correlations between built
environment measures; individual built environment
measures may confound other measures loading onto the
same factor. However, strong correlations preclude for-
mal testing of this hypothesis. Additionally, the degree of
confounding by built and SES environment characteris-
tics in our study may have been minimized by weak built
environment-MVPA relationships.
Implications
These findings suggest that failure to adjust for both eco-
nomic and social aspects of the SES environment may
lead to biased estimates of some built environment-
MVPA associations. Fortunately, census variables are
readily available. In contrast, relatively weak confounding
by other built environment characteristics is encouraging
for studies without the wide range of measures used in
this study. However, in several cases, simultaneously
adjusting for multiple built environment measures mag-
nified the associations. Furthermore, in studies showing
stronger associations or examining one-dimensional built
environment measures, omission of additional built envi-
ronment characteristics may lead to more substantial
underestimation of effects. Finally, even small degrees of
confounding may influence conclusions drawn from gen-
erally weak associations in the extant literature.
Forging ahead with replicable measures into longitudinal
settings and external populations
Multidimensional built and SES environment constructs
identified from factor analysis allowed us to simultane-
ously examine a large set of measures with respect to
MVPA. In a next step, we used the knowledge gained
from factor analysis to create simplified measures (Tables
8 &9) that incorporate inter-relationships, yet are more
easily replicable in future studies. We emphasize that our
simplified measures represent the set of variables identi-
fied using factor analysis and should be interpreted as
such. In fact, replication of regression results with single
indicators demonstrates that these measures, which are
often analyzed on their own, may act as proxies for
underlying environmental constructs.
Two branches of investigation are needed to better
understand the potential causal effects of these measures.
First, these simplified measures can be used in longitudi-
nal analyses and examination in external populations. As
opposed to other strategies such as scale measures, they
are readily understandable and examined in prior
research, and selection of single indicators reduces the
number of measures needed to replicate findings in other
studies.

Second, investigation of mechanisms leading to the
observed associations will help to distinguish between
proxies and policy-relevant determinants of physical
activity. For example, crime replicated associations
between the disadvantageous social environment factor
and MVPA, but how crime might influence physical
activity, or if yet another characteristic is the causal agent,
is unknown. Research incorporating psychological mea-
sures (e.g., self-efficacy and perceived barriers) or
detailed audit-based environment data (e.g., aesthetics
and quality of facilities) can improve understanding of
behavioral mechanisms. Such research may reveal addi-
tional layers, possibly showing our multidimensional
environment constructs as proxies for more qualitative
inter-personal or cultural aspects of the environment.
Determining whether patterning of environmental
measures is similar in other populations is an important
next step. If patterning in other age groups differs sub-
stantially from our nationally representative sample of
adolescents, our simple measures may have limited ability
to represent the constructs identified in this study and
thus must be tested before applying them in other popu-
lations.
We found differences in built environment-MVPA
associations by sex, which is consistent with previous
studies examining walkability and physical activity
resources [32,40,41]. Homogenous landscape appears to
be a negative correlate of MVPA for males but not
females, possibly because males may be more likely to be
active outdoors [42] with less regard to safety or other
concerns. Intensity (pay facilities) was associated with
lower MVPA in females but not males. On the other
hand, count of public facilities corrected for population
was associated with higher MVPA in females but not
males, perhaps also due to safety concerns addressed by
access to facilities. Such differences by sex may shift as
adolescents age into adulthood, when overall physical
activity levels are lower [19], or decrease among adoles-
cents over time as physical activity promotion efforts in
recent decades may have addressed barriers such as safety
or provided additional sex-neutral activity opportunities.
Further investigation of the dose-response relationship
between the built environment and MVPA is another
opportunity for future research. We found non-linear
associations between four aspects of the built environ-
ment and MVPA. The strongest associations were gener-
ally observed for the largest quartile, which, due to data
skewness, contained very large factor score or measure
values. Using quartile measures allowed comparability
between associations with factors versus single indica-
tors, but closer examination of dose-response and shape
of the relationship is warranted. Shifts in the shape of the
dose-response relationships - sometimes alternating
between monotonic and U-shaped - with additional cova-
riates add complexity and should be further examined.
Limitations and Strengths
Limitations include cross-sectional study design, which
does not imply causality. Yet, we identified replicable
measures that set the stage for longitudinal analyses,
which can establish temporality and better address bias
due to residential self-selection [43,44]. Second, there was
some temporal mismatch between individual-level inter-
views (1995-96) and GIS data sources (e.g., StreetMap
2000, 1992 land cover dataset), but our GIS is unique in
providing historical data approximately contemporane-
ous with multiple survey waves. Our county-level crime
measure was crude, yet it provided an objective measure
of safety available across the US that was strongly associ-
ated with MVPA. Third, while we analyzed an extensive
number of environmental variables, we did not consider
quality of facilities, perceived environment measures, or
other potential psychological mediators.
Fourth, we examined overall leisure time MVPA fre-
quency, which does not distinguish between possible
behavior-specific effects [45] or incorporate physical
activity duration or intensity. Our built and SES environ-
ment measures may show stronger relationships with
specific types of physical activity. For example, stronger
relationships may be present between alpha street con-
nectivity and active transportation behaviors, or between
pay or public facilities and team sports or exercise.
Clearly, future research should examine behavior-specific
associations while accounting for complex patterning of
the environment.
Finally, we did not address urbanicity, which may be an
important moderator [46] of built environment-MVPA
relationships. However, our study informs a growing
body of work using national datasets by addressing envi-
ronment patterning and confounding in broad range of
neighborhood environments as well as examining mea-
sures applicable longitudinally during periods in which
individuals may move in or out of urban areas. Addition-
ally, the wide range of existing urbanicity measures are
generally based on environment characteristics of inter-
est (e.g., population density), thereby obscuring practical
applications such as modification of the built environ-
ment in suburban areas to more closely resemble urban
areas. Nevertheless, analogous analysis stratified by some
measure of urbanicity is an important next step.
Additional strengths include examination of a wide
range of environment measures in a nationally represen-
tative sample of adolescents, an understudied population.
We explicitly examined and compared built and SES envi-
ronment characteristics, which were strongly related.
Finally, we used pattern analysis methods to not only

investigate inter-relationships, but also to inform the cre-
ation of replicable measures.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrates substantial inter-relationships
between environmental characteristics and suggests that
many aspects of the built and SES environments should
be incorporated into analysis in order to minimize con-
founding. Further, commonly used built environment
measures may reflect more general environmental pat-
terning and should be interpreted as such. Examination
of how a broad range of environmental characteristics
mutually influenced their relationships with physical
activity suggested complex mechanisms involving a myr-
iad of social and cultural factors. Finally, we present sim-
plified, replicable measures that are cross-sectionally
related to physical activity in adolescents. Better charac-
terization of the environment, longitudinal analysis, and
exploration of mechanisms in future studies can increase
our understanding of built environment features that
should be targeted in physical activity promotion policy.
