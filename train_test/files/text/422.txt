OBJECTIVE -- Diabetes is associated with increased risk of urinary incontinence. It is un-
known whether women with pre-diabetes, or impaired fasting glucose (IFG), have increased
prevalence of incontinence. We determined the prevalence of, and risk factors for, incontinence
among U.S. women with diabetes and IFG.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- The 2001­2002 National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey measured fasting plasma glucose and obtained information about
diabetes and urinary incontinence among 1,461 nonpregnant adult women. Self-reported
weekly or more frequent incontinence, both overall and by type (urge and stress), was our
outcome.
RESULTS -- Of the 1,461 women, 17% had diabetes and 11% met criteria for IFG. Prevalence
of weekly incontinence was similar among women in these two groups (35.4 and 33.4%,
respectively) and significantly higher than among women with normal fasting glucose (16.8%);
both urge and stress incontinence were increased. In addition to well-recognized risk factors
including age, weight, and oral estrogen use, two microvascular complications caused by dia-
betes, specifically macroalbuminuria and peripheral neuropathic pain, were associated with
incontinence.
CONCLUSIONS -- Physicians should be alert for incontinence, an often unrecognized and
therefore undertreated disorder, among women with diabetes and IFG, in particular those with
microvascular complications. The additional prospect of improvements in their incontinence
may help motivate some high-risk women to undertake difficult lifestyle changes to reduce their
more serious risk of diabetes and its sequelae.

Urinary incontinence, present in
nearly 50% of middle-aged and
older women, results in psycholog-
ical stress and social isolation and has a
profound effect on quality of life (1). The
costs are substantial, up to $32 billion per
year in the U.S., and greater than the an-
nual direct costs for breast, ovarian, cer-
vical, and uterine cancers combined
(2,3).
Type 2 diabetes also is a common and
costly disorder. While 17 million adults
in the U.S. have diabetes, another 43 mil-
lion adults are estimated to have "pre-
diabetes," or impaired fasting glucose
(IFG) (4,5). Recent evidence strongly sug-
gests that urinary incontinence is a com-
mon complication, from 50 to 200%
more common among women with type 2
diabetes than among women with normal
glucose levels (6­8). However, no studies
have determined whether women with
IFG are also at higher risk of incontinence.
While it is known that incontinence is
more common in women with diabetes,
mechanisms by which type 2 diabetes
may contribute to its development or se-
verity are not well defined. A likely etiol-
ogy for incontinence is microvascular
damage, similar to the disease process in-
volved in development of retinopathy,
nephropathy, and peripheral neuropathy.
Accordingly, duration of diabetes (7,8),
insulin treatment (6), peripheral neurop-
athy (8), and retinopathy (8) have been
shown to be important risk factors for in-
continence among women with diabetes.
Less is known about risk factors specific
to urge and stress incontinence among
women with type 2 diabetes, even though
these clearly differ in clinical presentation
and response to treatment.
We conducted a cross-sectional anal-
ysis using data from the 2001­2002 Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES). Our goal was to esti-
mate prevalence and identify risk factors
for urinary incontinence among women
with pre-diabetes or diabetes. We were
able to evaluate a broad range of inconti-
nence risk factors, while controlling for
potential confounding variables.

als so that nationally representative esti-
mates of health could be generated in these
population groups. Among the sample of
2,531 nonpregnant adult women who were
20 years of age, we excluded 213 who did
not undergo the NHANES physical exami-
nation,171whohadincompleteurinaryin-
continence information, and another 686
women without a known diagnosis of dia-
betes who had not fasted for at least 8 h
before their laboratory tests. After these ex-
clusions, a total of 1,461 (57.7%) women
remainedinouranalysissample.Womenin
our study population did not differ in age,
race, parity, BMI, and estrogen use com-
pared with the women who were excluded.
Our primary analyses of risk factors for in-
continence was conducted in the sub-
sample of 164 women with IFG and 246
women with diabetes.
Diabetes was defined by a self-report
of diabetes or if fasting plasma glucose
level was 126 mg/dl (9). IFG was de-
fined as fasting plasma glucose between
100 and 125 mg/dl (10). The remaining
women, with fasting glucose 100 mg/
dl, were classified as having normal glu-
cose levels. NHANES ascertains self-
reported diabetes duration, use of oral
hypoglycemic medications, use of insu-
lin, and history of physician-diagnosed
retinopathy. Additionally, all participants
were questioned about symptoms of pe-
ripheral neuropathy over the past 3
months, including "numbness or loss of
feeling in your hands or feet other than
from your hands or feet falling asleep,"
and "a painful sensation or tingling in
your hands or feet. . . not including nor-
mal foot aches from standing or walking
for long periods." Participants were also
asked whether they ever had an ulcer or
sore on their leg or foot that took 4
weeks to heal. HbA1c
(A1C) level was
measured from blood specimens on all
participants by the Primus automated
high-performance liquid chromatogra-
phy analyzer (Primus, Kansas City, MO).
A random urine sample was obtained
from all participants during the survey.
Urinary albumin concentration (in micro-
grams per milliliter) was measured by sol-
id-phase fluorescent immunoassay (11)
(Sequoia-Turner, Mountain View, CA),
and urinary creatinine concentration (in
milligrams per milliliter) was measured
by the modified kinetic method of Jaffe
´
(Beckman Instruments, Brea, CA). Mi-
croalbuminuria was defined as a urinary
albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 30­300
mg/g and macroalbuminuria as an albu-
min-to-creatinine ratio 300 mg/g. All
laboratory tests were collected at a single
examination, and details about the labo-
ratory procedures of all these tests are
published elsewhere (12).
Urinary incontinence was deter-
mined by a self-administered question-
naire based on validated instruments used
in previous studies (13). The sequence of
incontinence questions began with
"[d]uring the past 12 months have you
leaked or lost control of even a small
amount of urine. . . ," followed by "with
an activity like coughing, lifting, or exer-
cise?" (stress incontinence) and "with an
urge or pressure to urinate and could not
get to the toilet fast enough?" (urge incon-
tinence). Frequency for each type of in-
continence was ascertained as every day, a
few times a week, a few times a month, or
a few times a year. The primary outcome
of interest was weekly or more frequent
incontinence. We also examined the level
of bother of incontinence and the effect of
incontinence on the participant's quality
of life. Participants were asked about the
degree of worry created by urine leakage
and the affect of urine leakage on day-to-
day activities during the previous 12
months. These questions were catego-
rized as "not at all" or "only a little" versus
"somewhat," "very much," or "greatly."
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using Stata (version 8;
Stata, College Station, TX) programs spe-
cialized for complex survey data. These
procedures accommodate sampling
weights, as well as compute SEs and use
modified hypothesis tests that account for
stratification and clustering of the multi-
stage NHANES sampling design. The
sampling weights are inversely propor-
tional to the probability of selection into
the sample and are therefore interpretable
as the number of individuals in the target
population that each sample participant is
estimated to represent. Moreover, the
weights are corrected to sum-to-subpopu-
lation totals by region and demographic
subgroup, based on the U.S. Census.
Thus, the national prevalence of inconti-
nence among women with diabetes was
estimated by a weighted proportion; spe-
cifically, it was estimated by the number
of diabetic women in the population with
incontinence (sum of weights for sampled
women classified as having diabetes who
report incontinence) divided by the num-
ber of women in the target population
with diabetes (sum of weights for sampled
women in this category).
We assessed heterogeneity in the
prevalence of urinary incontinence across
women with normal fasting glucose,
women with IFG, and women with diabe-
tes using a 2 test with correction for the
survey design. Risk factors for urinary in-
continence were assessed using logistic
regression models suitable for complex
survey data, which accommodate the
sampling weights and use "robust" SEs
and modified t tests with degrees of free-
dom equal to the number of primary sam-
pling units, minus the number of strata.
We performed separate models for
women with diabetes and IFG and then a
combined model pooling these two pop-
ulations. Model derivation began with a
list of predictors determined a priori, with
final multivariable models selected by
backward deletion, retaining risk factors
that remained significant at P  0.15 after
adjustment. Age, BMI, and parity were in-
cluded by default in these models. Corre-
lations between predictors were generally
0.4, indicating that collinearity did not
adversely affect our estimates. We found
no persuasive evidence of an interaction
between various risk factors and glucose
group.
RESULTS -- Of the 1,461 women in
our analysis, 246 (16.8%) were classified
with diabetes and another 164 (11.2%)
met criteria for IFG. The overall preva-
lence of weekly or more frequent inconti-
nence was similar among women with
diabetes and IFG (35.4 and 33.4%, re-
spectively) and significantly higher than
among women with normal fasting glu-
cose (16.8%) (Table 1). Similarly, both
urge and stress incontinence were signif-
icantly more common among diabetic
and pre-diabetic women (P  0.001).
Furthermore, among women with incon-
tinence, women with diabetes were more
likely to report being bothered by their
incontinence symptoms, while both dia-
betic and pre-diabetic women felt that in-
continence affected their daily activities
significantly more than nondiabetic
women. Adjustment for BMI did not at-
tenuate the difference among the three
glucose subgroups.
Table 2 shows the characteristics of
the women with normal glucose, IFG, and
diabetes. Women with diabetes were
more likely to be of ethnic minority back-
ground and have a higher BMI and waist
circumference than those without diabe-
tes. As expected, women with diabetes
were more likely to report peripheral neu-
ropathy symptoms, foot ulcers, hyperten-

sion, stroke, and claudication. Mean A1C
level was 7.3% in diabetic women com-
pared with 5.7% in women with IFG. As
expected, higher proportions of women
with diabetes had micro- and macroalbu-
minuria than women with IFG or normal
glucose. Almost half of all diabetic women
reported fair or poor overall health status
compared with only a quarter of women
with IFG and 18% of normoglycemic
women.
In multivariate logistic models, pe-
ripheral neuropathy pain, a marker of mi-
crovascular disease, was independently
associated with any weekly incontinence
among women with diabetes, while mac-
roalbuminuria was close to criteria for sta-
tistical significance (Table 3). Past history
of hysterectomy was the only other signif-
icant risk factor among diabetic women.
Among women with IFG, microalbumin-
uria was strongly associated with in-
creased odds of incontinence, as were
other well-established risk factors for in-
continence. Since we were limited with
small numbers of outcomes in each pop-
ulation with abnormal glucose, and since
the estimated prevalence of incontinence
was similar among women with diabetes
and IFG, we pooled these two popula-
tions. A multivariate model in this com-
bined population showed that both
macroalbuminuria and neuropathic pain
are associated with incontinence (Table
3).
We also constructed separate models
for weekly stress incontinence and urge
incontinence. Results of these models
within the diabetes and IFG populations,
both separately and combined, were
similar to the models for any weekly
incontinence. For urge incontinence,
macroalbuminuria (OR 6.63 [95% CI
1.14­38.51]) and a history of foot ulcer
(19.16 [0.89­411.01]) were associated
with incontinence among diabetic
women, whereas neuropathic pain was
not significant. For women with IFG,
presence of microalbuminuria was asso-
ciated with significantly increased odds of
both stress (6.83 [1.21­38.42]) and urge
(7.45 [1.59­34.98]) incontinence.
CONCLUSIONS -- In the NHANES
2001­2002 sample, one out of three
women with IFG or diabetes reported
weekly or more frequent urinary inconti-
nence. We estimate that 12.7 million
women have weekly incontinence in the
U.S., including 1.9 million women
(95% CI 1.3­2.5) with IFG and another
2.5 million women with diabetes (2.1­
2.9). Compared with nondiabetic
women, those with diabetes and pre-
diabetes have a threefold increased prev-
alence of urge incontinence and twice the
prevalence of stress incontinence. Nearly
60% of women with diabetes and weekly
incontinence considered their inconti-
nence bothersome, and 20% reported
that it interfered with their daily activities;
this was two times more frequent than
that reported by incontinent women
without diabetes.
Increased prevalence of urinary in-
continence among women with diabetes
has been previously reported in cross-
sectional analyses (7,8,14). However, no
studies have examined whether women
with IFG, or pre-diabetes, also have in-
creased prevalence of incontinence. Since
some diabetes complications are observed
before the diagnosis of diabetes (15), we
hypothesized that the prevalence of uri-
nary incontinence may also be increased
among pre-diabetic patients. We found a
strikingly similar prevalence of inconti-
nence, both overall and by type, among
the pre-diabetic and diabetic women in
NHANES. While the difference in preva-
lence among the glucose subgroups may
be accounted for by several shared risk
factors (BMI, parity, hysterectomy status,
and hormone therapy use), these risk fac-
tors continued to be independently asso-
ciated within each glucose subgroup.
We also found that microvascular
complications, specifically peripheral
neuropathic pain and macroalbuminuria,
were associated with increased risk of
weekly incontinence in diabetic women.
These associations suggest that inconti-
nence may indeed be another microvas-
cular complication, possibly through
disturbances of the nerve supply to the
urethral sphincter and bladder, causing
sphincter damage and involuntary blad-
der contractions resulting in incontinence
(8,16). Thus, our findings suggest that
therapies for microvascular complica-
tions of diabetes may be beneficial in the
prevention or treatment of urinary incon-
tinence. Although we did not find that
A1C or blood pressure were related to in-
continence, therapies that improve glyce-
mic and blood pressure control may be
useful for incontinence because both im-
proved microvascular complications in
the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study
(17,18). This hypothesis should be test-
able in the ongoing Action to Control Car-
diovascular Risk in Diabetes trial.
Our finding of a similarly high prev-
alence of incontinence among women
with pre-diabetes and those with diabetes
suggests that incontinence may be an ear-
lier consequence of hyperglycemia than
other microvascular complications. Sur-
prisingly, microalbuminuria was associ-
ated with increased odds of incontinence
among women with IFG. Hyperglycemia
and hyperinsulinemia, which are both re-
lated to obesity, may be present before
diabetes diagnosis and contribute to the
risk of micro- and macrovascular disease.
Importantly, we found increasing
weight was significantly associated with
incontinence, similar to the association
found among women without diabetes
(6). Weight reduction has recently been
shown to improve incontinence in mod-
erately obese women (19). The likely
mechanism is that decreasing abdominal
weight reduces intra-abdominal and in-
travesicular pressure, as well as urethral
mobility. We have previously found that
intensive lifestyle change resulting in
weight loss decreased prevalence of in-
continence among women with pre-
diabetes who were enrolled in the
Diabetes Prevention Program (20). We
are currently investigating whether
weight loss among women with type 2
diabetes is also associated with decreased
incontinence in the Look AHEAD (Action
for Health in Diabetes) study (21). Fur-

thermore, it has been suggested that the
prospect of improved incontinence may
motivate overweight and obese women to
lose weight (19). If this proves accurate,
then preventing or improving inconti-
nence may help motivate women with
pre-diabetes or diabetes to undertake dif-
ficult lifestyle modifications that reduce
diabetes incidence by 40­60% and may
also prevent complications associated
with diabetes (20,22).
Similar to other earlier reports of risk
factors for incontinence among women
without diabetes (7), we found that oral
hormone therapy is an important risk fac-
tor for incontinence among women with
pre-diabetes and diabetes. Women cur-
rently using oral estrogens were at a three-
fold increased risk of incontinence.
Recent large, randomized trials of hor-
mone therapy have found that standard
doses of oral estrogen increase both inci-
dence and severity of incontinence
(13,23). When women with pre-diabetes
and diabetes consider starting or stopping
hormone therapy, they should be informed
of the increased risk of incontinence.
Hysterectomy is the most common
major gynecologic surgery in the U.S. Ap-
proximately 40% of older women have
had a hysterectomy, of which 90% are
performed for benign conditions and
most are elective. Among nondiabetic
women, hysterectomy is associated with a
40­60% increased risk of incontinence
(24). We found that among women with
pre-diabetes and diabetes, hysterectomy
is associated with a nearly threefold in-
creased risk of incontinence. Thus, we
recommend that women with pre-
diabetes and diabetes considering hyster-
ectomy receive counseling regarding the
potential long-term adverse effects of
incontinence.
Some risk factors, in particular micro-
vascular complications, increasing
weight, and oral estrogen use, are associ-
ated with both urge and stress inconti-
nence, suggesting that interventions
addressing these risk factors may improve
both types of incontinence. In contrast,
age was associated only with urge incon-
tinence. Similar to our findings, large ob-
servational studies have found urge
incontinence associated with advancing
age (6). As the population ages, both dia-
betes and urge incontinence will mark-
edly increase in prevalence. Clinical
outcomes of common treatments for in-
continence in women with pre-diabetes
and diabetes have not been critically ex-
amined, and randomized controlled trials
are needed to assess the efficacy and safety
of conservative, pharmacologic, and sur-
gical treatments.
While this NHANES survey included
a population-based sample of women
with a wide age range, we were limited in
the definition of the glucose categories.

The American Diabetes Association has
recommended the use of a fasting plasma
glucose value 126 mg/dl, confirmed by
repeat testing on another day, as being
indicative of diabetes (15). We were lim-
ited to a single fasting glucose measure-
ment for the diagnosis of diabetes or IFG,
so our study may have misclassified some
women with diabetes who may have had
IFG, or even normal fasting glucose, on
repeat testing. Frequency and type of in-
continence were included in the ques-
tions for the NHANES; however, severity
of incontinence could not be determined
and length of time of incontinence symp-
toms was not present.
In conclusion, prevalence of inconti-
nence is comparably elevated among
women with pre-diabetes and diabetes, as
compared with women with normal glu-
cose levels. Furthermore, incontinence is
more bothersome and has a greater effect
on daily activities in this population. Phy-
sicians should be alert for incontinence,
which is often unrecognized and there-
fore undertreated, among women with di-
abetes and IFG, in particular those with
microvascular complications. The pros-
pect of improved incontinence may help
motivate women to undertake difficult
lifestyle changes that have been shown to
reduce the risk of diabetes and its se-
quelae. Therapies with the potential to
improve or prevent incontinence in this
population are weight loss, stopping hor-
mone therapy, and therapies that improve
or prevent microvascular disease, includ-
ing glycemic control and blood pressure
control.
