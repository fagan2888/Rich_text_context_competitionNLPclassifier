Objectives. The purpose of this study was to test with panel data an extended model of the stress process recognizing
the separate effects of a parent's need for care and an adult child's caring activities.
Methods. Using data from the 1996, 1998, and 2000 waves of the Health and Retirement Study, we estimated
nonlinear mixed models of mental health outcomes. We assessed mental health for separate samples of 3,350 men and
3,659 women by using an 8-item scale of depressive symptoms. We also explored the sensitivity of results to alternative
measures and model specifications.
Results. We found that female, but not male, caregivers whose parents needed care exhibited adverse mental health
consequences. However, we found that, generally, both male and female noncaregivers whose parents needed care were
more likely to report symptoms of depression than were noncaregivers without disabled parents. Additional findings
suggest that the stress process is still more complex among married couples.
Discussion. This study distinguishes the outcomes of parental care needs from those attributable to caregiving
activities. Adverse psychological outcomes appear to be dispersed throughout the family. To focus narrowly on active
caregivers is to underestimate the social burdens of disability at older ages.
ASUBSTANTIAL body of research addresses the mental
health consequences of providing informal care to
disabled elders. Theoretical contributions have identified
various stressors, rewards, and family roles as aspects of the
caregiving process, and numerous empirical studies have
presented evidence of the adverse effects of being a caregiver.
Although recognizing that an older parent or spouse's
disability is itself an independent disturbance acting throughout
the family (Brody, Hoffman, Kleban, & Schoonover, 1989;
Schulz, O'Brien, Bookwala, & Fleissner, 1995), most empir-
ical literature confines its attention to consequences among
active caregivers only. In some cases, studies have also
examined adaptations to the death of the care recipient.
Researchers have directed much less attention beyond
caregiver­care recipient dyads.
The general stress and adaptation literature, which provides
a foundation for much caregiver stress research, views stress
as a complex process with interrelated domains of sources,
mediators, and manifestations (Pearlin, 1989; Pearlin, Lieber-
man, Menaghan, & Mullan, 1981). Caregiving stressors are
defined as difficulties created by care demands that are
disruptive for a caregiver insofar as they exceed the individual's
ability to adapt (Aneshensel, Pearlin, Mullan, Zarit, &
Whitlatch, 1995). Researchers have differentiated between
primary stressors (e.g., the care recipient's impaired condition
or the caregiver's subjective emotional reaction to it) and
secondary stressors (problems arising as a result of caregiving
but outside of caregiving roles; Aneshensel et al.). Although
this theory clearly identifies parental disability as one of the
stressors associated with caregiving, researchers have not yet
fully explored its effect on family members other than those
involved in direct care provision.
Although researchers have directed much attention towards
stressors and their negative consequences, being a caregiver can
produce psychological benefits as well as costs. Caregivers
report multiple enjoyable aspects of care, such as enhanced
caregiver­care recipient relationships, personal growth, caring
self-competence, increased understanding of the aging process,
satisfaction with social involvement, and ability to provide
good care (for a meta-analysis, see Pinquart & So
¨rensen, 2004).
Raschick and Ingersoll-Dayton (2004) found that adult
children who provided care to their parents experienced more
rewards than did spousal caregivers. A ``unified model'' linking
caregiver stress to health outcomes, discussed in Schulz,
Gallagher-Thompson, Haley, and Czaja (2000, 33­60), incor-
porated both adverse and positive responses to caregiving,
suggesting that physical and mental health outcomes repre-
sented net responses to these opposing forces.
Although past work has often focused on the individual
caregiver rather than the whole family (Gatz, Bengtson, &
Blum, 1990), more recent studies have viewed caregiving as
a family-system problem. Caregiving affects all members of
a family network by diverting a caregiver's time away from
other family members, changing the family's lifestyle and
conditions, producing feelings of guilt, and engendering
conflict over the care arrangements (Brody et al., 1989; Gatz
et al.; Strawbridge & Wallhagen, 1991; Toseland, Smith, &
McCallion, 1995). Although this theory has implications for
noncaregiving family members, this group has not been
a particular focus of caregiving research.
In Amirkhanyan and Wolf (2003), we found evidence of
noncaregiver stress, manifested as a decline in emotional health
associated with an older parent's need for care and distinct from
an adult child's caregiving activities. Our analysis of cross-

sectional data from the 1992 Health and Retirement Study
(HRS), which collected data from caregivers and noncaregivers
with different patterns of parental care needs, allowed us to
separate the psychological outcomes of parental disability from
those impacts uniquely attributable to caregiving activities. Our
findings suggested that it may not have been caring itself, but
rather one's parent's need for care, that produced the adverse
mental health consequences of caregiving discussed in the
past research.
The literature on caregiver stress continues to grow, but
investigators continue to overlook the separate contributions to
health outcomes made by a loved one's care needs and one's
response to those needs. For example, Dunlop, Song, Lyons,
Manheim, and Chang's (2003) analysis of 1996 HRS data
compared the prevalence of major depression between re-
spondents who did and did not help their parents with basic
daily activities. Similarly, Chumbler, Pienta, and Dwyer (2004)
used 1992 HRS data in order to compare the depression scores
of adult children caring for, and not caring for, older parents.
Both studies found elevated levels of depression among
caregivers (although in the latter study, this finding emerged
only among respondents with a living father); neither study,
however, included controls for parents' needs for care.
Our 2003 study is subject to the usual problems associated
with use of cross-sectional data, particularly that of omitted-
variable bias. For example, intergenerational correlations in
health might lead to a common dependence of parental care
needs and one's own poor mental health on omitted factors.
Furthermore, various selection mechanisms might lead indi-
viduals with a predisposition to the manifestations of stress to
adopt, or to persist in, parent-care activities. Accordingly, the
goal of the present study is to provide a methodologically more
rigorous validation of the model proposed and tested in our
previous work. Specifically, we address the missing-variable
problems by applying a random-effects estimator to panel data
from later waves of the HRS. We also explore the sensitivity of
our basic findings to several alternative measures and model
specifications.
METHODS
Study Design and Data Source
Our data came from the HRS, an ongoing panel study that
began in 1992 and that collects a broad range of demographic,
health, and economic data. Respondents were originally from
the 1931­1941 birth cohort, and respondents from additional
birth cohorts were added later (for an overview of the HRS, see
University of Michigan [n.d.]). Our analysis used data from
Waves 3, 4, and 5 (1996, 1998, and 2000) of the HRS. We
chose these waves based on changes that study organizers made
to the data collection instruments throughout successive waves
of interviewing. Specifically, the questions used to form the
depression scale changed from Wave 1 to Wave 2 and have
since remained fixed, while the questions on care provided to
parents changed from Wave 1 to Wave 2, and again from Wave
2 to Wave 3, thereafter remaining fixed. Wave 3 of the HRS
included the cohort of persons born between 1931 and 1941
(and, if married, their spouses), but starting in 1998 this sample
was supplemented with persons born before 1931 or between
1942 and 1947 (and their spouses). We excluded age-ineligible
spouses as well as respondents currently living in a nursing
home (or whose spouse is living in a nursing home) from this
analysis. However, we did include the characteristics of age-
ineligible respondents as spousal variables. In addition, we
excluded respondents with no surviving parents (and, if
married, parents-in-law). We note below additional inclusion
conditions and their implications for sample size.
Dependent Variable
Our measure of psychiatric morbidity was a variation on the
Center for Epidemiologic Studies­Depression (CES-D) scale,
which was designed to measure depressive symptoms by em-
phasizing their subjective and affective elements (McDowell &
Newell, 1996; Radloff, 1977). Beginning with Wave 2, the
HRS adopted an 8-item battery of CES-D items, with each item
limited to two response categories (yes and no). Six of the 8
CES-D items indicate the presence of depression, and 2 indicate
its absence. The lead-in question for this version of the CES-D
reads as follows: ``Now think about the past week and the
feelings you have experienced. Please tell me if each of the
following was true for you much of the time during the past
week. Much of the time during the past week, . . ..'' Table 1
contains the 8 items that are then presented to respondents
(bolded words in the table correspond to the variable names
used in our presentation of results in the next section). Table 1
also shows the percentages of men and women who gave
positive responses (after recoding, as appropriate) to each item.
This 8-item scale has been used in several published studies of
mental health based upon HRS data (Gallo, Bradley, Siegel, &
Kasl, 2000; Siegel, Bradley, Gallo, & Kasl, 2003, 2004). Gallo
and colleagues assessed its reliability and validity using 1992
and 1994 HRS data and concluded that it has acceptable
measurement properties. Although the existing caregiving
literature discusses many positive aspects of caregiving,
measures of psychological benefits of caring are not available
in the HRS. The measure of emotional health used in this study
thus captures the net effect of all negative and positive impacts
of caregiving.
The CES-D items were not administered to proxy respon-
dents (Wallace et al., 2000). For this reason, more than 1,200

PARENT CARE AND THE STRESS PROCESS S249
sample individuals are missing a depression score. We used
logistic regression in order to identify the salient characteristics
of the missing-data cases; the results (not shown) indicated that
individuals with missing CES-D responses were principally
older husbands with poor self-reported health. None of the
explanatory variables associated with caregiver activities or
with needs for care were significantly related to the absence of
the CES-D items. We did not introduce any explicit controls
for this selectivity in the results reported here.
Independent Variables
Need. --We constructed variables that indicated whether at
least one of the respondent's parents or, for married persons,
parents-in-law, ``need[ed] any help with basic personal needs like
dressing, eating, or bathing,'' or, due to a health condition, could
not ``be left alone for an hour or more.'' This information, which
came from two separate HRS questions, captured a relatively
severe level of parental disability, reflecting either a limitation
in the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) or
a significant cognitive limitation. Beginning in 1998, the HRS
added a third question, ``Has a doctor ever said that your [mother/
father/mother-in-law/father-in-law] has a memory-related dis-
ease?'' This permitted a broadened measure of the parental need
for care, especially care needs associated with cognitive decline
(Ory, Hoffman, Yee, Tennstedt, & Schulz, 1999).
Caregiver. --Starting with Wave 3, the HRS asked respon-
dents if they (or their spouses) had spent a total of 100 or more
hours since the previous interview (or in the past 2 years)
helping parents or parents-in-law with basic personal activities
like dressing, eating, and bathing. Investigators asked partic-
ipants who responded affirmatively to specify (for themselves
and their spouses, separately) the number of hours spent
helping each parent or parent-in-law. We have coded as
caregivers people who had spent a total of at least 200 hours
(rather than the 100 hours built into the question) providing
care during the 2-year reference period. We made this choice in
order to produce comparability with our past work (Amirkhan-
yan & Wolf, 2003), in which we had coded as caregivers
individuals who had provided at least 100 hours of care during
a 12-month period. According to Soldo and Hill (1995), the
HRS adopted the 100-hour minimum threshold in the 1992
interview in order to filter out low-intensity (e.g., 1 or 2 hours
per week) caring activities. Implicit in that design decision was
an assumption that care hours were evenly distributed through-
out the 12-month period, an assumption that may have been
incorrect; we discuss this problem in more detail later. Never-
theless, by imposing the 200-hour minimum threshold in the
current analysis, we identify as caregivers those whose average
care intensity is comparable to that used in our earlier research.
Respondents who could not or would not specify a precise
number of hours--about half of all reported caregivers--were
further prompted by investigators to indicate whether their care
amounted to more or less than 200 hours, and, if more than
200 hours, whether it was more or less than 500 hours. Using
these bracket questions, we were able to classify nearly all care-
giversaseitherlow-intensity(i.e.,providingfewerthan500hours
of care) or high-intensity caregivers (i.e., providing 500 hours
or more of care). We also created separate indicators of the pro-
vision of care to one's own parents and to one's parents-in-law.
The activities mentioned in the HRS question that we used to
code our need variable (i.e., dressing, bathing, and eating) were
identical to those mentioned in the question upon which we
based our caregiver variable. An additional HRS question asked
whether respondents helped parents ``. . . with other things such
as household chores, errands, transportation, etc.'' The tasks
mentioned in this question fall into the category of instrumental
ADLs (IADLs), and we used this item to code an IADL care-
giver variable. The HRS does not, however, include a question
aimed at detecting parents' needs for IADL assistance.
Each member of a couple could be coded as a caregiver,
allowing us to include a spouse caregiver variable in the
analysis, as well. This variable was 0 by definition for single
respondents. Similarly, we constructed sibling (or spouse's
sibling) caregiver variables, which indicated whether any of the
respondent's (or spouse's) siblings had helped their respective
parents with basic personal needs in the past 2 years. The HRS
questionnaire does not impose a minimum on the hours-of-help
question as it pertains to siblings. As an additional measure of
``care by others,'' we included variables indicating whether the
respondent's parent or parent-in-law was institutionalized at the
time of the interview.
The need variable described in the preceding section refers to
parents alive at the time of the interview, whereas the caregiver
variables just described refer to individuals who had provided
care to currently living, or to recently deceased, parents or
parents-in-law at any time during the 2-year period preceding
the interview. In order to avoid falsely coding as a caregiver
a respondent who had provided care to a surviving parent
judged not to need it, we eliminated from the sample any
respondents who had experienced the death of a parent (or
parent-in-law) during the 2-year reference period. However,
that restriction did not completely eliminate problems caused
by changing levels of care intensity within the 2-year period.
Some people coded as caregivers may have provided all of
their care hours early in the 2-year period, and none recently,
whereas others who adopted the caregiver role shortly before
the interview may not yet have reached the 200-hour threshold.
We coded participants in the former group as caregivers (but
arguably should not have done so), whereas we did not code
those in the latter group as caregivers (but surely should have
done so). Despite these ambiguities, researchers have used the
HRS parental-care variable in several published papers (e.g.,
Chumbler, Pienta, & Dwyer, 2004; Dunlop et al., 2003;
Dunlop, Lyons, Manheim, Song, & Chang, 2004; Killian,
Turner, & Cain, 2005; Lee, Walker, & Stroup, 2001; Reid &
Hardy, 1999). The problems outlined here will tend to bias
downward any adverse effects of providing care, because recent
(yet currently inactive) caregivers would presumably be less
depressed than current caregivers. We conducted an auxiliary
analysis intended to assess the adequacy of our caregiver
variable, and we report our findings from that analysis in the
next section.
Additional variables. --We created dummy variables reflect-
ing the respondent's current health (poor health) and disability
status (disabled). We coded the poor health variable as 1 if
a respondent rated his or her health as fair or poor (rather than
AMIRKHANYAN AND WOLF
S250
excellent, very good, or good). The disabled variable indicated
whether the respondent, when answering a question about
employment status, stated that he or she was ``disabled and
unable to work.'' We used analogous variables in order to
describe the health and disability status for married respon-
dents' spouses.
Indicators of the respondent's marital status included in the
analysis were: divorced or separated, widowed, and never mar-
ried. Two dummy variables represented educational attainment:
whether the person had received a high school diploma or
passed an equivalency test, and whether the respondent had
earned a college degree or higher. Other covariates describing
respondents' demographic characteristics were age, number of
children, and two dummies indicating respondents being
African American or Hispanic. Wealth was a household-level
variable that measured total net worth, including both housing
and non-housing equity.
Estimation
The measurement properties of our dependent variable, in
combination with the presence of repeated individual-level
outcome measures, presented special modeling and estimation
problems. Some past research employing the short form of the
CES-D as used by the HRS has retained the full range of scale
values (integers ranging from 0 through 8) while adopting an
estimation approach that treated this inherently discrete variable
as though it were continuous (Gallo et al., 2000; Siegel et al.,
2003, 2004). However, the distribution of the variable was
extremely skewed, with a modal value of 0. Imposition of
a logarithmic transformation (of the original score, to which is
added a small constant) is inadequate for producing a symmetric
distribution (Siegel et al., 2004). Commonly used regression-
type models for count data (e.g., Poisson or negative-binomial
models) are inappropriate because such models impose no
upper bound on the value of the count variable, yet the short
form of the CES-D has an upper bound of 8. Moreover, models
for count data implicitly assume that all counted items are
identically distributed. Yet, the marginal distributions of the
eight CES-D items reported in Table 1 strongly indicate the
inappropriateness of such an assumption. For men, the percent-
age of affirmative responses ranged from 6% to 26%, whereas
for women it ranged from 9% to 33%. Some researchers have
recoded the underlying 8-item score into a dichotomous indi-
cator according to a severity threshold (Blustein, Chan, &
Aguilar, 2004; Mojtabai & Olfson, 2004; Nygaard, Turvey,
Burns, Crischilles, & Wallace, 2003); this approach, however,
entails the loss of a substantial amount of information.
In order to address these issues, we modeled the CES-D
score using a nonlinear mixed model. Our model contained
both item-level and time-period fixed effects, along with a four-
component random effect. In particular, we modeled individual
i's response to CES-D item j at time t, Yijt
, using a binary
logistic regression:
logitðPr½Yijt
¼ 1Þ ¼ a1j

: ð1Þ
In Equation 1, the variables T2
and T3
are dummy variables
indicating data from the 1998 (t ¼ 2) and 2000 (t ¼ 3)
interviews, respectively. Thus, the constants a1j
( j ¼ 1, . . . , 8)
represent item-specific intercepts in time period 1 (1996), while
a2
and a3
are time-period fixed effects that apply equally to all
outcomes. Note that a single parameter vector (b) represents the
effects of explanatory variables (Xit
) on all eight CES-D items.
We model the random effects ui
and eit
(t ¼ 1, 2, 3) as
independent normally distributed effects with variances to be
estimated. We interpret ui
as a measure of fixed personality
traits that manifest themselves in a tendency to respond to all
eight CES-D items more (or less) positively than expected,
conditional on the measured explanatory variables Xit
, while
each of the period-specific random effects eit
are interpreted as
transitory influences on the CES-D items. For example, short-
term work- or family-related stressors salient during a respon-
dent's 1996 interview, but not in either 1998 or 2000, may
produce a tendency to respond to all eight CES-D items more
(or less) positively than would be expected given both the
contemporaneous measured variables Xi1
and the permanent
random effect ui
. We estimated the model using aML software
(Lillard & Panis, 2003).
RESULTS
We first present results from a ``basic'' model--a repeated-
measures counterpart to the approach taken in Amirkhanyan
and Wolf (2003)--and then from three variations on that basic
model. Table 2 shows descriptive statistics for the sample used
in the basic model, along with estimated parameters of the
model. The number of distinct men (women) appearing in the
analysis is 3,350 (3,659); because each can appear once, twice,
or three times depending on the vital status of his or her parents
in each wave, the number of observations contributed by these
samples is larger (6,290 and 6,927, respectively). Each time he
or she is observed, a respondent supplies 8 outcome measures,
so the overall sample sizes for the regressions are quite large.
The need and care variables in combination identified four
distinct groups: (a) noncaregivers whose parents do not need
care (the reference group); (b) caregivers whose parents are not
reported to need care; (c) noncaregivers whose parents do need
care; and, finally, (d) caregivers whose parents need care. Our
analysis used a set of dummy variables that distinguished
among the cells of this two-way categorization. Women were
more than twice as likely as men to care for parents, regardless
of whether the parent receiving the care had been judged by the
respondent not to need it (1.2% vs 0.5%) or to need it (6.1% vs
2.8%). Around 31% of both the men and the women in this
sample had one or more living parents or parents-in-law that
reportedly needed care, but for whom these men and women
were not themselves providing such care.
The regression results shown in Table 2 generally support the
findings from our previous study. For both men and women, it
appeared to be stressful not to provide care when one's parent
needed it--we found, in other words, evidence of significant
noncaregiver stress. The odds of an affirmative response to
a CES-D item rose slightly more for women (odds ratio ¼ 1.26)
than for men (odds ratio ¼ 1.16) in this situation. Among
women, but not men, there was also a significant increase in
the odds of reporting depressive symptoms if they were caring
for a parent with care needs. Although the point estimates
imply that being a caregiver is more stressful than not being
a caregiver, conditional on a parent's need for care, we failed
to find significant differences between the regression coeffi-
PARENT CARE AND THE STRESS PROCESS S251
cient on the ``need ¼ yes, care ¼ yes'' variable and that on the
``need ¼ yes, care ¼ no'' variable. For women, for example, the
test statistic (formed using the covariance matrix of regression
coefficients) was t ¼ 1.202 ( p ¼ .23). Thus, whereas for women
(but not men) we found evidence of caregiver stress, the
observable manifestations of that stress were not statistically
different from those of noncaregiver stress. We found no
mental health effects of providing IADL assistance; or of the
care activities of spouses, siblings, or siblings-in-law; nor did
we find any effects of parental institutionalization.
In most cases, coefficients on covariates included in these
equations (which are not shown here but are available upon
request) accorded with past research: Depression scores fell
with age and education, rose in response to disability or poor
health, and were higher among unmarried than married in-
dividuals. The item-specific intercepts also exhibited consider-
able variability, as we would have anticipated based upon
the means shown in Table 1 (likelihood-ratio tests overwhelm-
ingly rejected an equality constraint on the intercepts, with v2
statistics of 2,033 and 2,556 for the men's and women's
models, respectively). The results also indicated that a good
deal of the pattern of CES-D responses was associated with
unmeasured factors, represented by the random effects ui
and
e1i
À e3i
. Each of these random effects was estimated with a
high degree of precision. Moreover, in any given year slightly
more than half of the variability in unmeasured factors was due
to permanent factors.
As noted earlier, our indicator of caregiver status missed
some current caregivers, those who had moved into the care-
giver role shortly before the interview and had not yet reached
the 200-hour threshold embedded into our caregiver variable. It
also included as caregivers some persons who had occupied
that role within the past 2 years, but not at or immediately prior
to the time of interview. For both of these reasons, any
estimated impacts of caring on CES-D scores (through either
the ``need ¼ no, care ¼ yes'' or the ``need ¼ yes, care ¼ yes''
pathways) may be biased downward. As a test of the adequacy
of our caregiver variable, we estimated a conventional model
of caregiver stress: In this model, we controlled for caregiver
status but not for parental need, producing a regression-adjusted
difference in depressive responses between caregivers and
noncaregivers (all other control variables appeared in these
models). In this version of the model, the estimated increase in
the log odds of a positive response was 0.189 for men (SE ¼
0.188; p ¼ .315), 0.231 for women (SE ¼ 0.105; p , .05), and
0.237 in a model that pooled men and women, with an
additional control for gender (SE ¼ 0.089; p , .01).
For an external point of comparison to these estimated effects,
we used results obtained in the meta-analysis reported by
Pinquart and So
¨rensen (2003). Integrating findings from 43
separately published articles, Pinquart and So
¨rensen found a
mean effect size of 0.29 standard deviations on depression
scores among adult child caregivers; the lower and upper bounds
of the 95% confidence interval for this estimate were 0.10 and
0.48, respectively. We then applied Chinn's (2000) method in
order to convert our estimates to effect sizes; Chinn's method
(which entails dividing the log-odds coefficient by a scale factor
of 1.81) produced an effect size of 0.128 for women and 0.131
for men and women combined. Both estimates lie within the
interval estimate for caregiver effects reported by Pinquart and
So
¨rensen (2003). The latter comparison was undoubtedly more
valid, because Pinquart and So
¨rensen did not stratify their results
by caregiver gender. Although this comparison did not prove
that the HRS caregiver variable was free of measurement error, it
did lend support to its use as an indicator of caregiving status in
an impact analysis such as ours.
The remaining tables report results from three variations on
our basic model; in each case we report only the key parameters
representing the need and care effects. Table 3 shows the
consequences of distinguishing between low-intensity (from
200 to 500 hours) and high-intensity (500 hours or more)
caregiving. These findings used slightly smaller samples,
because we omitted from the analysis caregivers for whom
we could not assign intensity categories. The mean values
shown indicate that women were more likely to be in the high-
intensity category (77% of all female caregivers) than were men
(71% of all male caregivers). The care-intensity distinction did
not alter the findings shown in Table 2: We found statistically
significant noncaregiver stress for both men and women, but

we found significant caregiver stress for women only. And,
although the point estimates on low- and high-intensity care-
giving were larger than the coefficient on ``need ¼ yes, care ¼
no'' for women, those two coefficients were not significantly
different from each other nor were they significantly different
from the ``need ¼ yes, care ¼ no'' coefficient.
Table 4 shows the consequences of using the broader
measure of care needs found in the 1998 and 2000 waves of
HRS data. The broader need variable added very few cases of
otherwise undetected parental need for care, however (and did
so mainly in the ``need¼yes, care¼no'' category). For women,
the findings agreed with those already reported. However, for
men, we no longer found evidence of noncaregiver stress.
Finally, Table 5 shows the results after having employed
separate need and care variables for the respondent's parents
and parents-in-law. Because these models were intended to get
at possible own-parent versus parent-in-law effects, we limited
the analysis to married men and women (the number of men
and women differed, however, due to the fact that spouses with
out-of-range years of birth were excluded from the study).
Except for the ``need ¼ yes, care ¼ no'' variables, the means
were quite small. Unsurprisingly, women who provided care to
their own parents represented the most common caregiving
situation. However, it is interesting to note that married men
were almost as likely to care for their parents-in-law as for their
own parents, and married women were about as likely as their
husbands to care for their husbands' parents. Only 2 of the
12 regression coefficients shown in Table 5 were statistically
different from zero at the p ¼ .05 level: It appeared that
husbands' mental health was adversely affected by having
parents-in-law with care needs yet not being involved in caring
for them. Among married women, we found statistically sig-
nificant evidence of caregiver stress but not of noncaregiver
stress with respect to their own parents' needs.
DISCUSSION
The adverse mental health consequences of providing care to
a disabled or frail elderly family member are well established
in the literature. Our goal in the present study was to investigate
an additional possibility, namely the consequences of not
providing care when a close family member needs it. Our
findings generally suggest that having a parent with serious care
needs produces adverse mental health consequences, especially
for women. The exception to this pattern occurred in the model
that used separate controls for parents' and parents-in-law's
need and care, applied to married men and women only (Table
5). In that case, we found evidence of noncaregiver stress
for men (but only with respect to their wives' parents) and of
caregiver stress for women (but only with respect to their own
parents). Such findings suggest that it may be worthwhile to
further explore the subtle differences in the effects of various
caregiving arrangements involving own parents and in-laws.
Specifically, it may be interesting to examine whether men are
negatively affected by in-laws' care needs when their wives
are involved in caregiving. This could be done by adding
interaction effects (for example, Own care for own parents 3
Spousal care for in-laws; Own care for in-laws 3 Spousal care
for own parents; and others) to our third model. The sample size
available for the present study does not allow us to address this
level of complexity. Moreover, our objectives in the present
study were more limited in scope, namely to demonstrate using
panel data that being a noncaregiver and having a disabled
parent or parent-in-law can produce adverse mental health out-
comes similar to those of caregivers.
Our results were generally consistent with those found in
our earlier cross-sectional analysis (Amirkhanyan & Wolf,
2003). Both studies call into question the interpretations of
much prior empirical research on caregiver stress. In the typical
study, a researcher compares the mean depression score in a
sample of caregivers to that in a matched comparison group
of noncaregivers. In the comparison group, the potential care
recipients are presumably in good health and are not disabled.
With such a research design, interpretation of between-sample
differences is problematic: The difference could arise because
caregiving is stressful, or it could arise because having a close
family member with care needs is stressful. Our use of a sample
of persons at risk of being caregivers, while controlling for
the various need and caring situations, supports the latter in-
terpretation.
As noted earlier, the HRS data introduce some unavoidable
measurement problems into our analysis. Principal among these
is a timing problem, due to the fact that the need and outcome
variables were contemporaneous with the interview, whereas
the care variable pertained to a 2-year reference period. The
most important of our findings, namely the pervasiveness of
noncaregiver stress, is probably the least affected by this
problem. Someone who has provided fewer than 200 hours of
care over a 2-year period is surely not a caregiver, unless they
took on the caregiver role just before the interview. This type

PARENT CARE AND THE STRESS PROCESS S253
of measurement error tends to bias towards zero any estimated
impacts; our results on noncaregiver stress, however, were
nearly always statistically significant. For individuals coded
as caregivers, the measurement error problems were probably
more serious, at least in a relative sense in view of the fact that
many more observations appeared in the ``need ¼ yes, care ¼
no'' than in the ``need ¼ yes, care ¼ yes'' category. Here, again,
measurement error will tend to produce a downward bias in
estimated effects. Accordingly, our findings that caregiver
stress is not larger than noncaregiver stress (with the one
exception mentioned earlier) should be treated cautiously. And,
despite the potential--and untestable--measurement-error
problems, our estimate of the relative size of caregiver and
noncaregiver depression scores fell within the range of impacts
reported in a recent and comprehensive meta-analysis (Pinquart
& So
¨rensen, 2003).
Although the caregiver stress literature has shown that
women experience more caregiving costs than do men
(Raschick & Ingersoll-Dayton, 2004; Yee & Schulz, 2000),
our results suggest that women may also experience higher
costs of being noncaregivers. This result raises questions about
the consequences of gender-specific role expectations among
women. Relationships between adult children and their parents
are often shaped by two apparently conflicting sets of norms:
obligation and independence (Lye, 1996). Research has shown
that gendered expectations of such obligations treat as equitable
caregiving arrangements with overinvolved women and under-
involved men (Ingersoll-Dayton, Neal, Ha, & Hammer, 2003).
Consequently, women whose behaviors are at odds with
a prevailing ideology that views them as natural caregivers
(Hooyman & Gonyea, 1995) may suffer when they fail to take
on caregiving duties.
The existing literature on the stress process provides a basis
for interpreting our findings concerning noncaregiver stress.
Past research has shown that caregivers report rewards as well
as stressors associated with providing personal care. Thus, the
negative effect of the primary stressor, parental need, among
noncaregivers is not mediated by any rewards associated with
the provision of care. In addition, among noncaregivers the
parent's needs for help dressing, eating or bathing are likely to
be met by other formal or informal sources. Researchers have
found that if siblings provide care, such situations can lead to
family conflicts over caregiving arrangements; the primary
caregiver's strain may, as well, be radiated to other family
members (Gatz et al., 1990; Strawbridge & Wallhagen, 1991;
Toseland et al., 1995). If non-familial sources provide the care,
noncaregiver stressors may include the fear of inadequate
quality of care or the feeling of guilt for not being able to ensure
a family-based end-of-life environment for a parent.
Finally, our findings point to the diffusion of negative
consequences of parental disability, manifested throughout the
family network, and touching not only the children but also the
children-in-law of the elders affected. There is a growing
interest in the costs of disease and disability at the national
and international level (e.g., Murray et al., 2002). For one
component of that cost--the adverse mental health consequen-
ces of caring for a disabled parent--the usual focus on the
active caregiver appears to be too narrow. In fact, we have
found only limited evidence that active caregivers are worse off
than other members of their families. The costs, in other words,
are experienced throughout the family group. To focus
narrowly on active caregivers is to underestimate the social
burdens of disability and poor health at older ages. Moreover,
interventions that reduce stress among active caregivers may, as
well, produce social benefits among family members not
actively engaged in providing care. Thus, investigators may
underestimate both the social costs of old-age disability and the
social benefits of programs that improve functioning when
research is too narrowly focused. These results should be
recognized in efforts to design interventions on behalf of
caregivers and to evaluate the effectiveness and societal
benefits of such interventions.
