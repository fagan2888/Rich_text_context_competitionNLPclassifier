RAPID COMMUNICATION
Projecting Future Complications of Chronic Hepatitis
C in the United States
Gary L. Davis, James E. Albright, Suzanne F. Cook, and Daniel M. Rosenberg
Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common and
often results in slowly progressive liver disease. Although
acute hepatitis C is now uncommon, most patients with
acute infection have developed chronic hepatitis, and,
therefore, the pool of infected patients is large. We used a
modification of a previously described natural history
model for HCV infection to project the number of cases of
HCV infection, cirrhosis, and liver failure over the next 40
years. The model estimated the prevalence of HCV infec-
tion in the United States was 3.07  106 in 1993 (com-
pared with an adjusted National Health and Nutrition
Evaluation Survey (NHANES) III estimate of 2.8 to 3.5 
106). A gradual decline in the prevalence of infection
should occur by year 2040 because of aging and natural
deaths among the infected pool. However, as the duration
of infection increases in the surviving cohort, the propor-
tion with cirrhosis will increase from 16% to 32% by 2020
in an untreated population. Complications of cirrhosis
also will increase dramatically over the next 20 years:
hepatic decompensation (up 106%), hepatocellular carci-
noma (up 81%), and liver-related deaths (up 180%).
Although current treatment regimens eradicate HCV in
over 50% of cases, many more patients would need to be
treated to significantly impact disease progression. Iden-
tification and treatment of every case of HCV infection
(with or without cirrhosis) would reduce the number of
cases of decompensated cirrhosis by almost half after 20
years. Despite the declining incidence of acute HCV infec-
tion, chronic hepatitis C is common. The prevalence of
cirrhosis and the incidence of its complications will
increase over the next 10 to 20 years, because the duration
of infection increases among those with chronic hepatitis
C. These data emphasize the need for greater access to
transplantation by expansion of the donor pool, increas-
ing use of split livers and living donors, and novel options
such as xenotransplantation. (Liver Transpl 2003;9:
331-338.)
A population survey a decade ago estimated that
nearly 4 million Americans have detectable anti-
body to the hepatitis C virus (HCV).1 In fact, this
number may be a significant underestimate of the
true prevalence because certain high prevalence
groups, such as prisoners and other institutionalized
persons, were not included in the survey.2 Most of
those infected with HCV acquired the disease 10 to
20 years ago, before identification of the virus and the
availability of screening tests.3-5 The recognition of
potential risk factors and the improved safety of the
blood supply have led to a dramatic decrease in the
incidence of new HCV infections in recent years. How-
ever, the overall prevalence of chronic infection has not
fallen because most acutely infected patients develop
chronic infection.6 Because liver disease caused by hep-
atitis C progresses slowly and does not result in major
morbidity for many years, we are only now beginning to
see the magnitude of the consequences of chronic infec-
tion.7,8
Patients with chronic hepatitis use health care
resources in obvious and direct ways such as clinic visits,
diagnostic tests, drug therapy, hospitalization for man-
agement of complications of cirrhosis, and liver trans-
plantation. Also, there are indirect costs related to lost
work time and impaired quality of life. Although the
current economic impact of chronic hepatitis C is sub-
stantial, there are few published studies.9 Cirrhosis
caused by chronic hepatitis C currently accounts for
8,000 to 12,000 deaths per year in the United States
and it is the leading indication for liver transplanta-
tion.6,10
The current burden placed on the health care system
by HCV infection is relatively small considering the
prevalence of infection. However, as the large pool of
currently infected patients age and their disease has time
to progress, more patients may develop complications
of liver disease and the burden on the health care system
will increase as a result. Thus, the purpose of this
study was to use a previously described and validated
mathematical model of the natural history of chronic
hepatitis C to project the future prevalence of chronic
hepatitis C, the incidence of complications related to

these events.
Methods
Markov Model
The natural history estimates for this study were developed
using a modification of the previously described Markov
model for chronic hepatitis C reported by Bennett et al.11
This computer simulation model examined progression from
the time of the initial patient presentation with a diagnosis of
chronic hepatitis and evolved through a progression algo-
rithm based on hepatic histology. The original model was
validated by replicating the results of two large natural history
studies through computer simulation.7,11,12 We modified the
front end of the Bennett model to enter patients into the
algorithm at the time of acute infection, adding the assump-
tions for resolution and progression to chronic infection that
are described below (Fig. 1). The model uses annual cycles
during which patients can remain in the same state of health
(hereafter referred to as disease states) or progress to another
disease state, for example from acute to chronic hepatitis. In a
Markov process, an individual faces a constant probability of
moving from one state to another within each of these annual
cycles (see Fig. 1 and reference 11 for listing of transition
rates). However, because the rate of progression is low for this
disease, most patients remain in the same disease state from
year-to-year. In addition, during each annual transition
period patients are subject to normal, age-adjusted, all-cause
death rates as described by the National Center for Health
Statistics (National Center for Health Statistics [www.
cdc.gov/nchswww/]). Thus, the computer model is designed
to quantify the expected number of HCV-positive patients in
various disease states across time. In this study, our particular
interest was in the relatively small subset that developed cir-
rhosis and complications of liver failure because these are the
patients who are likely to consume the most medical
resources. Initial projections assumed no treatment of the
cohort. Subsequent projections considered the effects of treat-
ing all or a proportion of infected cases.
Definitions
Acute and chronic HCV infections were defined by the pres-
ence of either self-limited or persistent viremia. Because the
model uses annual cycles, chronicity could not be determined
until the year after onset of acute infection. Thus, no patient
with acute infection could progress within the first year. Ful-
minant hepatitis caused by HCV infection is rare and was not

considered in the model. Progression of chronic hepatitis in
the model through the disease states of mild to more severe
hepatitis or cirrhosis was projected mathematically and nor-
mally would have been unrecognized clinically.11 Complica-
tions of cirrhosis were presumed to always be clinically appar-
ent, and the definitions of these disease states are obvious. The
transplant disease state was defined as the proportion of
decompensated patients who were deemed eligible transplant
candidates; we assumed for the purposes of the model that this
proportion would remain constant in future years at a level of
1,250 HCV patients per year.13,14 However, we recognize
that the current limits on the capacity of the health care
system to transplant this group might substantially improve in
the future with increased donation and more use of split grafts
and living donors and possibly through advances in xeno-
transplantation or stem cell technology. Once the current
capacity limit for transplantation had been reached in each
year, further transplant-eligible patients remained in their
current disease state in the model for another year; for exam-
ple, refractory ascites or hepatic encephalopathy. Several of
the disease states for decompensated cirrhosis are further sub-
divided into early (first year) and late (after 1 year) transition
states. This was done to reflect the higher mortality associated
with the first year after onset of these complications before
medical therapy is provided. For example, the 1-year survival
of patients presenting with variceal hemorrhage is 60%,
whereas the chance of surviving each subsequent year after
intervention with medical, endoscopic, or surgical therapy is
87%.15 Although not graphically displayed in Figure 1, all
patients in the model are subject to the normal age-adjusted
risk of death from nonhepatic causes during each annual cycle
of the model. Liver-related deaths derived from progression
through the model are reported as liver-related or excess mor-
tality.
Data Sources
Incidence of acute infection. Estimates of the annual inci-
dence of acute HCV infection from 1950 until the present
time were required for the model to project the prevalence of
chronic hepatitis C and its complications over time. The
national incidence of acute infection between 1982 and 1993
was based on the Sentinel County studies reported by the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC).3,6 The CDC adjusts
these estimates to account for recognition of only icteric or
symptomatic acute infections and significant underreporting
of new cases to public health authorities.3 The annual inci-
dence of infection for the years between 1950 and 1982 is
unknown and, therefore, was assumed to be the same as for
1982. Though this may overestimate infections during those
years, few patients infected before 1970 would survive long
enough to significantly impact the projections for disease in
coming decades. For years after 1993, we used the CDC
estimate of 28,000 acute infections in 1995.6 We further
assumed that the number of acute infections fell to 25,000 in
1996 and remained stable thereafter. Although a more recent
estimate by the CDC places the annual incidence at 36,000,16
our use of the lower estimate is more conservative and serves
to underestimate disease projections.
We assumed that 79% of acutely infected patients devel-
oped chronic infection.17-21 Of those with chronic infection,
we further assumed that 72.5% would have elevated liver
tests, whereas the remainder would have persistently normal
alanine aminotransferase (ALT).17-21,22,23 This distinction is
important because patients with normal ALT levels typically
have only mild histologic liver injury24,25 and progress at a
slower pace than those with abnormal test results.26 There-
fore, the model would have overestimated disease progression
if patients with normal ALT levels were not modeled at the
slower rate.
The histologic stage of the liver disease in most infected
patients is unknown. To estimate the histologic stage of the
liver disease in the cohort with HCV infection, we assumed
that patients had no liver disease at the onset of their acute
infection. We then used a bootstrap method to calculate his-
tologic progression from the time of infection through 1993
with the computer simulation model previously reported by
Bennett.11 Patients with persistently normal ALT levels were
assigned a histologic lesion in the year 2000 model cycle
according to the proportion of histologic grade and stage
observed in previous studies of such patients.24,25
Prevalence of chronic hepatitis C. The modified model was
able to calculate an annual prevalence of chronic hepatitis C
and to project those calculations into the future. Further-
more, the incidence-driven nature of the model meant that
the population with chronic hepatitis C could be further
characterized by the duration of infection and the spectrum of
histologic severity.
To validate the ability of this incidence-based model to
estimate prevalence, we compared our projected prevalence at
the end of 1993 to the prevalence of HCV infection reported
in the 1993 Third National Health and Nutrition Evaluation
Survey (NHANES III).27 NHANES III based its prevalence
estimate on confirmed anti-HCV positivity among surveyed
individuals and extrapolated these age-, gender-, and race-
dependent antibody prevalence rates to the United States
population at large using Bureau of the Census data.12 In this
way, it has been estimated that 3.9 million persons were
anti-HCV­positive in at the beginning of 1994.1,6 HCV-
RNA confirmation, serum ALT level, and histologic activity
were not available in the original NHANES III data set, but
reanalysis of stored serum found 74% to be HCV-RNA­
positive by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR).1 Other studies have also reported that only about
80% (range, 73% to 89%) of confirmed anti-HCV positive
patients are viremic if tested for HCV-RNA by RT-PCR.28-30
Thus, an HCV infection (HCV-RNA­positive) prevalence of
3.1million(range,2.8to3.5million)probablyisamoreaccurate
and realistic estimate based on the NHANES III database.
Treatment Effect
The model projections of the prevalence of HCV-related dis-
ease and its complications described above assume that no
333

treatment would be either available or provided. However,
there is now effective treatment for patients with chronic
hepatitis C. Combination treatment with pegylated inter-
feron and ribavirin achieves sustained virologic response
(SVR) in 54% to 56% of treated cases.31,32 We used a treat-
ment SVR rate of 50% and examined the effects of treating
various proportions of patients with chronic hepatitis C. We
assumed a one-time treatment of patients in the year 2000.
Results
Our incidence-based model estimated the number of
chronic hepatitis cases by the end of 1993 to be 3.07 
106 cases compared with the adjusted NHANES III
estimate of 2.8 to 3.5  106 (see previously in this
article). Incorporation of the 1994 to 2000 infection
incidence resulted in a 2000 prevalence of 2.94  106
chronic hepatitis C infections. The histologic distribu-
tion of the 2000 cohort cases included 61% with mild
hepatitis, 23% with moderate or severe hepatitis, and
16% with cirrhosis (compensated or decompensated).
The model projected the total number of patients
with chronic hepatitis C to decline gradually over the
next 3 decades (Table 1). This should occur as a result of
the stable low annual incidence of new infections and
attrition of the infected cohort, primarily from age-
related nonhepatic causes. Accordingly, the total num-
ber of age-adjusted survivors with chronic hepatitis C
fell to 2.87  106 (2%) by the year 2010, 2.68  106
(9%) by 2020, 2.43  106 (17%) by 2030, and
2.18  106 (26%) by 2040 (Table 1). However, as
disease progressed in the surviving cohort, the number
of cases with cirrhosis increased by more than 50% by
2010 and then plateaued. As a result, the proportion of
all HCV cases with cirrhosis increased to 25% in 2010,
32% in 2020, 36% in 2030, and 38% in 2040.
The number of patients with hepatic decompensa-
tion will increase dramatically over the next 30 years
(58% by 2010, 106% by 2020, and 124% by 2030)
and then plateau (Table 1). However, the model shows
that this is mainly a function of the number of cases
progressing to cirrhosis, because the proportion of
patients with cirrhosis with decompensation remains
relatively constant at 14% to 17%. Similarly, the num-
ber of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma increases over
the next 2 decades, nearly doubling before leveling off.
The projected number of liver-related deaths also
increases reaching almost 40,000 per year by 2040.
Age-adjusted nonhepatic deaths would continue to
exceed hepatic deaths until 2050, when hepatic compli-
cations will become the main cause of death among the
cohort.
Effect of Treatment
The previously described projections of HCV-related
disease and its complications assume that no treatment
was provided. Therefore, we examined the effect of
treating some of the patients with chronic hepatitis C. It
is not known what proportion of HCV-infected
patients currently receive or could be identified to be
considered for therapy or would be acceptable for treat-
ment. One survey estimated that only 30% to 40% of
infected patients in a Veterans Hospital population
would be optimal candidates.33 Given these uncertain-
ties, we modeled the effects of treating various propor-
tions between 10% (a minimum estimate) and 70%
(perhaps the maximum proportion of potentially treat-
able candidates) of infected patients. Model projections
show that identification and treatment of patients with
chronic hepatitis C reduces the number of cases of
decompensated cirrhosis in nearly direct proportion to
the proportion of the cohort identified and treated (Fig.
2). Treating 10%, 50%, or 70% of all hepatitis patients
with compensated liver disease would decrease compli-
cations of cirrhosis after 20 years by 5%, 24%, and
34%, respectively.
Initial experience with interferon monotherapy
showed that SVR was unusual in patients with cirrhosis,
and, therefore, many physicians chose not to treat
them. However, recent data with combination therapy
suggests that patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis respond
nearly as well as others.31,32 Therefore, we assessed the
long-term effect on complications of limiting combina-

tion treatment to those with or without cirrhosis. Treat-
ment of all patients was the optimal strategy for reduc-
ing both decompensation and hepatic deaths (Table 2).
However, because hepatic decompensation occurs only
in patients with cirrhosis, treatment responses in
patients with cirrhosis account for the early reduction in
disease complications and hepatic death (an average of
88% of the reduction observed during the first 5 years).
Therefore, excluding patients with cirrhosis from treat-
ment would reduce considerably the potential benefit
on disease morbidity and mortality that could be
observed during the first 10 years after treatment. The
benefits of treating patients without cirrhosis do not
accrue until much later and do not match those gained
from treating patients with cirrhosis until 11 years after
initial therapy. Treatment of patients with mild chronic
hepatitis would have little impact on the incidence of
hepatic decompensation over the next decade, but
would have a substantial impact thereafter, accounting
for only 11.0% of the reduction after 10 years, but
31.9% of the reduction after 20 years and 58.5% of the
decrease after 40 years (Table 2). Treatment of patients
with persistently normal ALT levels would reduce dis-
ease complications very little (2.0% during the next 10
years; 6.7% after 40 years). Treatment of patients with
persistently normal ALT levels would decrease the
number of patients with cirrhosis by only 2.1% after 20
years compared with no treatment.
Sensitivity Analysis
The assumptions made to estimate disease prevalence
and progression in the model were intentionally biased
to underestimate projections of future disease and com-
plications.11 However, the assumptions are based on
rates reported in the medical literature, and these rates
often can vary considerably, thereby leading to some
uncertainty in model estimates. The previously pub-
lished version of this model noted sensitivity to treat-
ment response rates such that a decrease in the response
rate would result in a proportional decrease in long-
term benefit.11 This remains important in the current
model because the projections use treatment response
rates from published clinical trials, which may differ
from response rates observed when the therapy is widely
applied in the community. A sensitivity analysis of the
modifications made to the previously described model
was conducted to test the robustness of the model and
its projections (Table 3). The major factor affecting the
projection of hepatic decompensation in the cohort is
the all-cause (nonhepatic) mortality rate. A higher non-
hepatic mortality rate among the cohort could signifi-
cantly reduce the number of projected cases of cirrhosis
and liver failure.
Discussion
Using data derived from annual incidence rates, our
model estimated that there were approximately 3.07
million people infected with HCV in the United States

Future Complications of Hepatitis C
in 1994, a figure similar to the estimate of the
NHANES III survey.1,6 Mathematical modeling esti-
mates that the total number of HCV infected cases will
decrease gradually in coming years as the incidence of
new infection falls and currently infected patients die
from nonhepatic, age-related causes. However, the
large pool of surviving patients remains at risk of pro-
gressive liver disease as the duration of their infection
increases. Indeed, the model predicts that an expanding
proportion of the patients with chronic hepatitis C will
develop cirrhosis over the next 2 to 3 decades, doubling
the current percentage by the year 2020. As a result,
there will be a dramatic increase in the number of cases
with complications of liver failure, hepatocellular carci-
noma, and death caused by liver disease. In fact, these
changes may already be occurring. Although our model
did not show a significant increase in disease complica-
tions in the last decade of the twentieth century, others
have reported an increase in hepatocellular carcinoma
and liver failure in patients with chronic hepatitis C.8,34
Interferon-based treatment regimens with the com-
bination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin result in
sustained loss of HCV in approximately half of treated
cases.31,32 Viral eradication is associated with reduction
in hepatic fibrosis, and, therefore, successful treatment
might be expected to reduce future disease complica-
tions.35 However, despite the impressive results in clin-
ical trials with pegylated interferons and ribavirin,
many patients are unaware of their infection, are not
candidates for treatment, are unable to complete the
course of treatment, or fail to respond. Considering
these factors and assuming that at most perhaps half of
patients could be identified and treated, we predict that
the most we could expect from aggressive treatment at
the optimal doses and duration of medication would be
a 24% reduction in the incidence of decompensated
cirrhosis after 20 years. This goal is best accomplished
by giving highest priority to treating patients with mod-
erately severe inflammation or fibrosis. Our model did
not consider that patients who do not permanently
clear virus might benefit from treatment with a reduc-
tion in the rate of fibrosis as has been reported by some
investigators.35,36 This theory remains unproven and is
currently being evaluated in long-term clinical trials.
Thus, our projections might underestimate the poten-
tial long-term benefit of treatment. Nevertheless, our
data show that current therapy and practice patterns
that identify and treat a relative minority of infected
patients will not be sufficient to control the future com-
plications of this infection.
Identification and treatment of a larger proportion
of infected patients, education about the importance of
abstinence from alcohol (the most important risk factor
for disease progression), and development of better tol-
erated therapies may help to achieve a more meaningful
impact on the morbidity and mortality of this disease.
Altough this may support recent calls for look-back
programs for transfusion recipients or large scale screen-
ing programs, such strategies have large up-front
costs.37 However, the costs of screening and treatment
may well be offset by reducing the later costs of treating
the complications of cirrhosis, which have been esti-
mated to exceed 1 billion dollars per year.9,38 Indirect
costs, including productivity loss and other societal
losses, could reach 7 to 8 billion dollars per year.38
Several studies have shown that treatment of chronic
hepatitis C with either interferon alone or in combina-
tion with ribavirin is highly cost-effective.11,39-41
Despite the effectiveness of current antiviral regi-
mens, our model clearly shows that the majority of cases
of cirrhosis are not prevented. Thus, the complications
of cirrhosis will continue to increase over the next 20 to
30 years. The need for liver transplantation will con-
tinue to far exceed the capacity of transplant centers to

handle the load. This clearly emphasizes the urgency in
developing and enacting measures to increase the avail-
ability of transplant services through increased organ
donation, use of living donors, or splitting cadaveric
livers. Research in xenotransplantation and stem cell
technology may provide future options for these
patients.
Obviously, projections provided by mathematical
models are limited by the accuracy of the model condi-
tions and assumptions. We used conservative assump-
tions that were intentionally biased to underestimate
disease complications whenever possible. However, our
use of a general-population, age-adjusted, all-cause
mortality rate may have resulted in an overestimation of
disease complications by as much as 22% (Table 3).
Some evidence suggests that the nonhepatic mortality
rate is higher in chronic hepatitis patients because of
comorbid conditions and risk factors for other dis-
eases.7,42 Furthermore, the model might have under-
estimated nonvirologic benefits of treatment, if they
occur, because only SVR rates were used. Finally, we
did not consider the likely availability of more effective
therapies or increased transplant volume in the future.
Nevertheless, the message is clear that an aggressive,
proactive approach is needed to first identify, educate,
and treat patients with HCV infection and, second, to
increase transplant resources.
