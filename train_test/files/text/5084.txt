Demonstration
Visual Geolocations. Repurposing online
data to design alternative views
Gabriele Colombo, Paolo Ciuccarelli and Michele Mauri
Abstract
Data produced by humans and machines is more and more heterogeneous, visual, and location based. This avail-
ability inspired in the last years a number of reactions from researchers, designers, and artists that, using different
visual manipulations techniques, have attempted at repurposing this material to add meaning and design new per-
spectives with specific intentions. Three different approaches are described here: the design of interfaces for
exploring satellite footage in novel ways, the analysis of urban esthetics through the visual manipulation of collec-
tions of user-generated contents, and the enrichment of geo-based datasets with the selection and rearrangement of
web imagery.

Introduction
The nature of data generated by humans and machines
is increasingly more heterogeneous, visual, and geo-
graphical. Humans are producing more photos than
ever before: from the array of figures that cyclically
are used to underpin the increasing visuality of our
society, one of the most striking is the one comparing
the amount of photographs taken every two minutes by
Americans only to those taken in the entire 19th cen-
tury (Mirzoeff, 2016). Thanks to location-aware tech-
nologies embedded in mobile devices, a large part of
this massive visual production is building up a corpus
of visual material pinned to physical locations.
Coverage of panoramic views by Google Street has
expanded to reach an unprecedented number of cities,
remote areas, historical landmarks, and indoor loca-
tions worldwide. Similar technologies have been
deployed by open communities with the goal of produ-
cing an alternative crowd-sourced photographic map-
ping of our surroundings. Active satellites constantly
generate streams of high-resolution footage of the
ground, online communities organize themselves with
DIY technologies--such as balloon and kite map-
ping--to produce alternative photographic footage
from above, and private companies sell drones able to
capture high-resolution maps and 3D models of the
ground.
Pictures taken and shared on social media, overhead
imagery, and street-level photographic mapping consti-
tute an incredibly rich corpus of location-based visual
material, partly available online. In the last years this
availability inspired a number of reactions from
researchers, designers, and artists that have attempted
at reusing this material with different intentions. Direct
visualizations of thousands of photos from social
media, superimposition of similar images collected
from the web, computer-generated collages of Google
Image results, handpicked strips of street view imagery
rearranged as catalogs: what seems to be a leading
thread of these experiences is the use of location-
based visual material found online as raw footage,
repurposed to design, through more or less invasive
manipulations, alternative views and perspectives on
our surroundings.

Telling a story about urban changes using historical
Street View panoramas; visualizing the materiality of
high frequency trading through location-based user-
generated content and Street View imagery; make a
point about geographical visual stereotypes using col-
lages of Google Image search results; inviting to recon-
sider formal repetitions in human-built infrastructures
by selecting and rearranging satellite footage: these
experiments resonate with the definition of a map as a
system of proposition rather than a representation
(Wood and Fels, 2008). They are artifacts designed
with a specific intention that goes beyond the mere rep-
resentation of space: they highlight unexpected connec-
tions, help to imagine alternative spatial configurations,
or expose the way in which geographical landmarks are
perceived.
Although using various types of material and apply-
ing different techniques, one may identify three (some-
times overlapping) approaches in which footage
collected online is repurposed:
. Repurposing available satellite imagery with various
strategies (from the design of interfaces for accessing
the footage in novel ways to the superimposition of
data layers);
. Adding materiality to an array of geo-coordinates
through the selection and rearrangement of hetero-
geneous visual material found online;
. Extracting visual signature of specific places--or
their cliche
´ d representation--by means of selection
and visual manipulation of different sized collections
of user-generated content.
The view from above: Repurposing
available satellite imagery
The view from above, once prerogative of the (military)
power, is now a democratized view: with an incredible
level of detail, submeter satellite footage covering
extensive areas of the globe is now available to
anyone. The fruition and exploration of this material
is however limited to available services, with predefined
exploration patterns and functionalities. Design has
proved to be very effective in transforming available
raw data sources into actionable knowledge, by struc-
turing and presenting data and information in mean-
ingful ways (Bonsiepe, 2000). Terrapattern represents
an effort to design an entry point into the increasing
availability of high-resolution photographic mappings
of the world (Figure 1). Described by the authors as
``similar-image search for satellite photos,'' it offers a
simple interface for performing ``visual query by exam-
ple'' on satellite footage. It allows to search and localize
visual features that can reveal undiscovered stories
about humanity's impact into the world (including
fracking wells, animal herds, logging roads, and con-
struction sites).
Terrapattern is not the first and isolated attempt at
exploiting satellite imagery to map human and natural
activities. Other experiments exploit the same view with
different techniques: from visual manipulations of the
footage itself to the superimposition of additional data
layers, performed through graphical annotation of the
material. Examples include the estimation of global oil
supply by monitoring and analysis of storage tanks seen
from above (Orbital Insight, 2016); a ``near real-time
deforestation monitoring system'' to promote conserva-
tion in the Andean Amazon region of South America
(Amazon Conservation Association and Conservacio
´ n
Amazo
´ nica, 2015); whale population assessment in the
Argentinian coast (Fretwell et al., 2014); identification of
war signs and documentation of human right violations
(The Enough Project and DigitalGlobe, 2010). Although
still limitedtoafew urbanareas,whatmakesTerrapattern
different compared to these examples is its exploratory
nature and the promise of making the search process of
satellite footage available also to nonexpert users.
A different response to the availability of highly accur-
ate photographic rendering of the view from above is the
one offered by artist Jenny Odell. In her Satellite
Collections (2009­2011), the artist manually selects
infrastructural elements (e.g., swimming pools, nuclear
cooling towers, stadium, basketball courts) from Google
Earth and reorganizes them, decontextualized from their
background, into compact aggregates (Figure 2).
Selection and decontextualization force to observe
those elements anew, reducing background noises. The
author describes the project as an invite to exercise obser-
vation of--and stimulate curiosity toward--``our own
inimitably human landscape'' (Odell, 2013). The tech-
nique, if applied systematically to footage from different
areas, can provide a glimpse into the impact of man-
made landscape modifications, by region.
Adding materiality to geo-coordinates
through web imagery
Visual elements can provide that material dimension
that is somehow lacking in most of (big) data-driven
analysis (Cardullo, 2015). Photographs and visual foot-
age may be used to provide context and materiality to a
collection of geo-coordinates.
The project Officer Involved (2016), by Josh Begley,
uses imagery from the web to add a visual layer to a
database on police brutality compiled by The Guardian.
The database contains data on people killed by law
enforcement agencies in the United States in the last
two years (including demographics, location, and
date). Officer Involved, featured in the online outlet
2 Big Data & Society 0(0)
The Intercept, presents each of those location data as
an image extracted either from Google Street View or
Google Maps satellite footage, providing what Teju
Cole (2015) has defined ``an immersion in the environ-
ment of someone's last moments.'' The images, cap-
tioned with the victim's name and the city where the
killing occurred, compose a large catalog of empty
intersections, town sidewalks, and suburban streets.
Isolated from the seamless continuum of Google
Maps and reorganized as an array of elements, those
apparently insignificant places constitute a reminder of
the breadth of the phenomenon, providing at the same
time the specificity of each single killing (Figure 3). Josh
Begley is not new to these kinds of interventions, work-
ing with visual footage in order to add context to (loca-
tion) data. Previous examples include a collection of
bird's-eye views of U.S. prison buildings (Begley,
2012) as well as a catalog of satellite views of reported
death locations of migrants trying to cross the U.S.
border from Mexico (Begley, 2016).
British artist James Bridle (2012) worked in a similar
direction with the project Dronestagram. For almost
three years, he collected and posted on Instagram
(cross-posting on Tumblr and Twitter) satellite images
of locations of drone strikes as they occurred. Strike
time and location data were provided by The Bureau
of Investigative Journalism, which at the time reported
on drone wars in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia. The
account, in the words of the artist, contributed to make
drone strikes (and their location) ``a little more visible,
a little closer. A little more real.''
The project Scandaglio (2016), by Italian collective
Offtopic Lab (www.offtopiclab.org) reuses Google
Street View imagery to visually enhance a mapping of
abandoned areas undertaken by the municipality of
Milan. The timeline feature embedded in Google
Street View, which allows to see images of a location
taken in the past by Google cars, is repurposed here as
a visual evidence machine. The project provides an
explorable interface of more than 100 locations in the
city (empty buildings, abandoned green areas, construc-
tion sites) as captured by Google in different years,
allowing monitoring urban development overtime
(Figure 4).
Reconciling geo-coordinates with their surroundings
is also the intention of the project ``A Network of
Fragments/Fragments from Networks'' by Benoi^t
Verjat and Donato Ricci. The interactive installation,
part of the exhibition Reset Modernity!, ``aims to make
visible local fragments of various networks used for
High Frequency Trading.'' For each coordinate of
this network, a view of the surroundings is offered by
juxtaposing content from different sources (Google's
satellite imagery, Google Street View, and Instagram),

assembling together, in one compact space, the location
of the network plotted on a map, the satellite view of
the antenna, and the ordinary visual landscape of those
living around it (Figure 5).
Composite locations: Extracting places'
visual signature from user-generated
contents
The amount of images produced and shared everyday
has reached an unprecedented scale. According to
Mary Meeker's 2016 Internet Trends report, every
day over three billion images are uploaded and shared
on Facebook-owned platforms and Snapchat alone
(Meeker, 2016). With geotagging features becoming
popular in most social media platforms, such a large
corpus of content, as well as the metadata attached to
it, are increasingly exploited by researchers to study
urban dynamics and structures (Crandall et al., 2009;
Hochman and Manovich, 2013; Hollenstein and
Purves, 2010). The project Phototrails by Nadav
Hochman at al. (2013) uses large collections of geo-
tagged Instagram images to compare ``global cities'
visual signatures.'' The observation of such visual sig-
natures is enabled by a series of transformations
(together with specific measurements) applied on the
collected material: images are drastically reduced in
their size and organized in different layouts, according
to measured values or metadata (e.g., median hue,
brightness mean, time of upload). The techniques
enable the detection of spatial and temporal visual pat-
terns in large collections of geo-referenced images, and
the key transformation that makes it possible is the
reduction of each element to a smaller size, where
details are lost in favor of focusing the attention on
formal features (Figure 6).
A different technique for distilling a place signature
from visual material collected online may be found in
the project ``CIRCA'' by Federica Bardelli (Figure 7).
The project aims at repurposing results from local ver-
sion of Google Image Search to observe how national
identities are reciprocally represented and perceived by
different countries. In the part of the project dedicated
to landscape observation, images of iconic buildings for
each country are manually selected from the results
(e.g., mosques for Turkey, the coliseum, and the leaning
tower of Pisa for Italy) and then aggregated into com-
posite visualizations based on each national image col-
lections. The outcomes function as ``comparable
representations'' enabling the observation of ``the meta-
morphosis of specific cliche
´ ,'' with the shifting of the
point of view.

Photographer Pep Ventosa explores a different
process in order to extract places' visual signature
using images culled from the web. In the series
titled ``The collective snapshot'' (2012), he selects
similar-looking images of iconic landmarks and then
overlays them to create what he defines ``an abstrac-
tion of the places we have been'' (Wilson, 2012). The
technique, similarly used by artist Corinne Vionnet in
the project Photo Opportunities (2004­2015), exposes
repetition in photographic formats and compositions,
providing a reflection on the extent to which afford-
able image capturing technologies have limited rather
than expanded our ability to look at our surround-
ings. The project Le Myope (2016) from Paris-based
artist Vincent Sapajou offers a playful response to the
same argument. Described as a ``short-sighted
camera'' by the author, Le Myope is a connected
camera that doesn't take any new photograph but
instead shows its user an existing picture collected
from the web, similar to the framed subject. The
camera, built on top of the similar-image feature of
Google Search, comes with code and instructions for
anyone to build their own.
Conclusions
In 1989 Italian photographer Luigi Ghirri (2010)
denounced a lack of representation of our
surroundings, resulting in an essential inability to
relate with our environment:
Television is 99% made of faces. Our surroundings are
never represented. I believe that this negation of the
space we inhabit is a very relevant fact: the inability
to relate with our space and environment is linked to
an absence of representation; and somehow, to a neg-
ligence about environmental issues. (Translation by the
authors)
Our surroundings are now extensively mapped: by
users uploading photos on social media and community
undertaking visual mapping projects, by Google cars
driving through cities and trekkers reaching remote
areas, by satellites orbiting overhead and drones
flying over fields and construction sites. Nevertheless,
this abundant visual footage risks to be lost in the digi-
tal stream of visual production that, as argued by
Trevor Paglen (2016) in a recent essay, is ``fundamen-
tally machine-readable'' and ``can only be seen by
humans in special circumstances and for short periods
of time.'' The presented projects constitute a positive
reaction to put this footage at use: by experimenting
with a number of visual manipulation tech-
niques--automatic collage, superimposition of thou-
sands of photos, decontextualization, sampling--they
extract this material from the stream of machine-
