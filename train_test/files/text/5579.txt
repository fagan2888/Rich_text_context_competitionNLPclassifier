Efficacy and tolerability of fixed-dose
amlodipine/olmesartan medoxomil with
or without hydrochlorothiazide in
Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients
whose blood pressure is uncontrolled on
antihypertensive monotherapy
Henry Punzi, Ali Shojaee and Jen-Fue Maa on behalf of the BP-CRUSH Investigators
Abstract:
Objectives: This is a prespecified subgroup analysis in Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients
of a study that evaluated blood pressure (BP) control with fixed-dose amlodipine/olmesartan
medoxomil (AML/OM)-based therapy in patients whose condition was uncontrolled on prior
monotherapy.
Methods: In this prospective, open-label, dose-titration study, patients with uncontrolled BP
after at least 1 month of antihypertensive monotherapy were switched to fixed-dose AML/OM
5/20 mg. Patients were uptitrated to AML/OM 5/40 and 10/40 mg, with uptitration to AML/OM
+ hydrochlorothiazide 10/40 + 12.5 mg and 10/40 + 25 mg to achieve target BP. The primary
efficacy endpoint was the cumulative proportion of patients achieving seated cuff systolic BP
(SeSBP) less than 140 mmHg (<130 mmHg in patients with diabetes mellitus) at 12 weeks.
Secondary endpoints included SeBP goal rates, ambulatory BP (ABP) target rates, and mean
change from baseline in seated cuff BP (SeBP) and ABP at weeks 12 and 20.
Results: Mean baseline BP was similar in Hispanics (153.6/92.8 mmHg; n = 105) and non-
Hispanics (153.7/91.8 mmHg; n = 894). At 12 weeks, 72.0% of Hispanics and 76.3% of non-
Hispanics achieved the primary endpoint. At week 12, goal rates for cumulative SeBP
(<140/90 mmHg or <130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes) were 69.0% and 71.5% in
Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients, respectively. Mean change in SeBP in Hispanics ranged
from ­15.3/­7.3 mmHg for AML/OM 5/20 mg to ­23.2/­13.8 mmHg for AML/OM 10/40 mg
+ hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, and in non-Hispanics from ­14.1/­7.8 mmHg to ­25.4/­13.7
mmHg (all p < 0.0001 versus baseline). A majority of patients achieved mean 24 h, daytime,
and nighttime ABP targets in both subgroups. Greater proportions of Hispanics achieved
ABP targets versus non-Hispanics at week 12; however, this trend was reversed at week 20.
Treatment was well tolerated.
Conclusions: Switching to a fixed-dose combination of AML/OM ± hydrochlorothiazide
provided significant BP lowering and effectively controlled BP in a large proportion of Hispanic
and non-Hispanic patients with hypertension uncontrolled on previous monotherapy.

Introduction
In the USA, the prevalence of hypertension and
other risk factors for vascular disease is high in
certain ethnicities and races, resulting in higher
morbidity and mortality in these groups [Flack
et al. 2010; Roger et al. 2011]. In Hispanic peo-
ple, the prevalence of hypertension is lower than
in black people, but the problems of undertreat-
ment or inadequate treatment of hypertension
and poor rates of blood pressure (BP) control
leading to increased risk of cardiovascular events
are shared by many ethnic or racial groups with
hypertension [Egan et al. 2010; Roger et al. 2011].
A report from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey from 1999 to 2008 found
that BP control rates have improved over recent
years in white, black, and Hispanic groups, but
awareness of hypertension (p = 0.03), treatment
rates (p = 0.006), and BP control rates (p = 0.004)
were all lower in Hispanic versus white people
[Egan et al. 2010]. For Hispanics or Latinos, the
following age-adjusted prevalence estimates from
the National Health Interview Survey/National
Center for Health Statistics were given for diag-
nosed conditions in people aged 18 years in
2009 [Pleis et al. 2010]: among Hispanics or
Latinos, 21.5% had hypertension, 8.5% had
heart disease, 5.8% had coronary heart disease,
and 2.0% have had a stroke.
Current hypertension guidelines state that the
majority of patients will require combination
therapy with at least two antihypertensive medi-
cations to achieve BP control [Chobanian et al.
2003; Mancia et al. 2007, 2009]. In patients with
hypertension, fixed-dose combination therapy
with two or more medications can simplify the
treatment regimen and potentially improve adher-
ence [Bangalore et al. 2007].
Despite the availability of effective antihyperten-
sive treatments and clear guidelines for the treat-
ment of hypertension, ethnic minorities are often
not treated appropriately to achieve BP goals;
studies have shown that racial/ethnic differences
in many aspects of hypertension are mainly due
to social and environmental factors [Thorpe et al.
2008]. Barriers to achieving hypertension control
in patients of all races include non-adherence to
therapy, lack of awareness (though awareness is
improving), lack of access to treatment, and clini-
cal inertia (failure to intensify treatment) [Weinick
et al. 2000; Okonofua et al. 2006;Yoon et al. 2010;
Nelson et al. 2011].
The Blood Pressure Control in All Subgroups
With Hypertension (BP-CRUSH) study evalu-
ated improvement in BP goal achievement after
patients whose BP was uncontrolled on previous
antihypertensive monotherapy were switched to
fixed-dose amlodipine/olmesartan medoxomil
(AML/OM) with or without hydrochlorothiazide
(HCTZ) combination therapy [Weir et al. 2011].
A subgroup analysis of BP reductions and goal
achievement in Hispanic and non-Hispanic
patients is reported here.
Methods
Study design
This was a prespecified subgroup analysis of
Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients enrolled in
the BP-CRUSH study [ClinicalTrials.gov identi-
fier: NCT00791258], a phase IV (IIIb in South
Africa), prospective, multicenter, open-label, sin-
gle-arm, dose-titration study with a 20-week active
treatment period. The results of the 20-week
active treatment period, including study popula-
tion demographics, inclusion and exclusion cri-
teria, study design, efficacy and safety variables,
and statistical analyses for the total cohort, are
published elsewhere [Weir et al. 2011].
Patients with hypertension whose condition was
uncontrolled on monotherapy after 1 month of
treatment were screened for study eligibility. Full
study inclusion/exclusion criteria have been
described previously [Weir et al. 2011]. Briefly,
the study inclusion criteria included uncontrolled
BP [mean systolic BP (SBP) 140 mmHg (or
130 mmHg for patients with diabetes mellitus)
and 180 mmHg and mean diastolic BP (DBP)
110 mmHg on two consecutive visits during
screening] after at least 1 month of antihyperten-
sive monotherapy with an angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker,
 blocker, calcium channel blocker (CCB), or
diuretic. On day 1, eligible patients were switched
from their previous antihypertensive monother-
apy to a fixed-dose combination of AML/OM
5/20 mg. Active treatment was administered once
daily each morning. Uptitration was permitted
every 4 weeks according to the following schedule
(Figure 1): uptitration to AML/OM 5/40 mg,
AML/OM 10/40 mg, AML/OM 10/40 mg
+ HCTZ 12.5 mg, and AML/OM 10/40 mg
+ HCTZ 25 mg. Patients were eligible to be upti-
trated to any AML/OM combination dose if their
H Punzi, A Shojaee et al.

mean SBP was at least 120 and less than 200
mmHg, or if their mean DBP was at least 70 and
less than 115 mmHg. Patients were eligible to be
uptitrated to any dose including an HCTZ add
on if their mean SBP was at least 125 and less
than 200 mmHg, or if their mean DBP was at
least 75 and less than 115 mmHg. Patients with
adequately controlled BP were maintained at
their titrated drug dose level. However, if BP
became uncontrolled during the maintenance
phase (SBP 130 mmHg or DBP 80 mmHg),
then patients were uptitrated to the next dosage
level and re-entered the titration phase of the
study. Patients receiving AML/OM 10/40 mg
(±HCTZ) who achieved a mean SBP of less than
120 mmHg and a mean DBP of less than 70
mmHg, and who were asymptomatic for hypoten-
sion, entered maintenance treatment and contin-
ued in the study at their current dosage level.
Patients with a mean SBP of at least 200 mmHg
or DBP of at least 115 mmHg at any visit exited
the study, as did patients with either an SBP of
less than 120 mmHg or a DBP of less than 70
mmHg with symptomatic hypotension.
Study assessments
The primary efficacy endpoint for the main study
(and for this subgroup analysis) was the cumula-
tive proportion of patients achieving the seated
cuff SBP (SeSBP) goal of less than 140 mmHg
(or <130 mmHg in patients with diabetes) during
the first 12 weeks of active treatment.
Secondary endpoints included the proportion of
patients achieving the SeSBP goal of less than
140 mmHg (or <130 mmHg in patients with
diabetes) at the last post-baseline visit at or prior
to week 12 [last observation carried forward
(LOCF)]; the cumulative proportion of patients
achieving the seated cuff BP (SeBP) goal of less
than 140/90 mmHg (or <130/80 mmHg in
patients with diabetes) from baseline to weeks 12
and 20; and the change from baseline in mean
SeSBP and seated cuff DBP (SeDBP) by titration
dose (LOCF). A cumulative approach to measur-
ing the proportion of patients achieving the BP
goal was used because BP is a dynamic variable
and patients with hypertension achieve the BP
goal at different time points during any clinical
assessment period just as would be observed in a
real-world setting. Consequently, this method
was chosen rather than reporting BP goal rate for
just one office visit which would not provide a
comprehensive view of BP goal achievement over
the course of treatment.
In the ambulatory BP (ABP) subgroup, endpoints
included the proportion of patients achieving com-
bined ABP monitoring (ABPM) targets at weeks
12 and 20, using the American Heart Association
(AHA)-recommended values of less than 130/80
mmHg for mean 24 h ABP, less than 135/85
mmHg for mean daytime (8 am­4 pm) ABP, and
less than 120/70 mmHg for mean nighttime ABP
[Pickering et al. 2005], and the change from base-
line in mean ambulatory SBP and DBP, including
mean 24 h, daytime, and nighttime BP, and change
in mean SBP and DBP during the last 2, 4, and 6
h of the dosing interval at weeks 12 and 20.
Safety assessments included the evaluation of
adverse events, laboratory parameters, and phys-
ical examinations.

Statistical analysis
The treated study population included all patients
who received at least one dose of study medica-
tion. The ABPM subgroup included all treated
patients with a valid baseline measurement and
week 12 or 20 ABP data.
The cumulative SeBP goal achievement rate by
visit was calculated as the ratio of the number of
patients who achieved the goal at any time from
the first dose date to the visit date over the num-
ber of patients who had any post-baseline BP data
by that visit. These continuous efficacy variables
were summarized with their corresponding 95%
confidence intervals. Changes in SeBP and ABP
from baseline were summarized by titration dose
(LOCF method) and by visit without the LOCF
method. The one-sample paired t test was used
to test for significance, and all statistical analyses
were performed at a two-sided significance level
of 5%.
Results
Study disposition, demographics, and
baseline characteristics
Out of a total of 1406 patients who were screened,
999 entered active treatment, of which 105
patients were of Hispanic ethnicity and 894 were
non-Hispanic. These patients comprised the
safety population (Table 1). The efficacy analysis
population, defined as those patients who received
at least one dose of the study drug and at least one
post-baseline assessment, consisted of 100
Hispanic and 885 non-Hispanic patients. A total
of 83 and 71 Hispanic patients had week 12 and
week 20 SeBP measurements, respectively, com-
pared with 782 and 674 for non-Hispanic patients.
A total of 289 patients from the total population
underwent ABPM, of which 44 patients were
Hispanic and 245 were non-Hispanic. Changes
from baseline and ABP target achievement were
assessed in patients with baseline, week 12 and
week 20 ABPM measurements.
Several differences between Hispanic and non-
Hispanic patients were evident at baseline.Hispanic
patients were younger than non-Hispanic patients:
mean age 52.9 versus 55.9 years, respectively. The
proportion of patients aged at least 65 years was
lower in the Hispanic cohort as well (14.3% versus
23.8%, respectively). The Hispanic cohort had a
greater proportion of men than the non-Hispanic
cohort (58.1% versus 50.0%, respectively), and
more patients with metabolic syndrome (51.4%
versus 45.6%).
Baseline BP (SeBP and ABP) was similar in both
Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients. Baseline

mmHg and 135.8 (±11.6)/81.0 (±9.5) mmHg,
respectively.
Efficacy
Cumulative systolic blood pressure goal
achievement. At the end of 12 weeks of active
treatment, 72.0% of Hispanic patients and 76.3%
of non-Hispanic patients achieved the primary
endpoint of an SeSBP of less than 140 mmHg (or
<130 mmHg for patients with diabetes) (Figure 2).
Figure 3 shows the cumulative proportion of
patients achieving the SeBP threshold of less than
140/90 mmHg at the highest dual combination
(AML/OM 10/40 mg) and triple combination
(AML/OM 10/40 mg + HCTZ 25 mg) therapy
doses in the Hispanic and non-Hispanic sub-
groups. The proportions of patients achieving this
BP threshold were similar for both Hispanic and
non-Hispanic patients.
Reductions in seated cuff blood pressure.Mean
SeSBP was significantly reduced from baseline at
the week 12 and week 20 visits in the Hispanic
(22.4 and 25.2 mmHg,respectively;both p < 0.0001)

and non-Hispanic (21.7 and 26.9 mmHg; both
p < 0.0001) subgroups. BP lowering achieved
with AML/OM-based therapy was similar in both
Hispanic (Figure 4A) and non-Hispanic (Figure 4B)
subgroups. SeSBP and SeDBP were significantly
reduced from baseline at the end of each titration
dose period (LOCF) in Hispanic and non-His-
panic patients (p < 0.0001). Mean [±standard
error of the mean (SEM)] (LOCF) changes from
baseline in SeSBP/SeDBP during the titration
periods ranged from ­15.3 (±1.6)/­7.3 (±1.0)
mmHg at the AML/OM 5/20 mg dose to ­23.2

respectively, for non-Hispanic patients.
Ambulatory blood pressure target achievement.In
Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients who under-
went ABPM, the proportions of patients achiev-
ing ABP targets based on AHA-recommended
normal values are shown in Figure 5.

pressure (BP) targets at weeks 12 and 20.
Therapeutic Advances in Cardiovascular Disease 6 (4)
156 http://tac.sagepub.com
A majority of patients attained mean 24 h, day-
time, and nighttime ABP targets in both cohorts.
However, a reduction in ABP target rates was
observed from week 12 to week 20 in Hispanic
patients. At weeks 12 and 20, 78.8% and 66.7%
of Hispanic patients, respectively, achieved a
mean 24 h ABP of less than 130/80 mmHg;
78.8% and 75.0% of Hispanic patients achieved a
mean daytime ABP value of less than 135/85
mmHg; and 69.7% and 62.5% of Hispanic
patients achieved a mean nighttime ABP value of
less than 120/70 mmHg (Figure 5A). Non-
Hispanic patients showed an increase in ABP tar-
get achievement from week 12 to week 20. At
weeks 12 and 20, 72.4% and 93.7% of non-His-
panic patients, respectively, achieved a mean 24 h
ABP of less than 130/80 mmHg; 71.9% and
90.3% achieved a mean daytime ABP value of less
than 135/85 mmHg; and 60.7% and 81.1%
achieved a mean nighttime ABP value of less than
120/70 mmHg (Figure 5B). A greater proportion
of Hispanic patients achieved all three ABP tar-
gets at 12 weeks compared with non-Hispanic
patients; however, a greater proportion of non-
Hispanic patients achieved all three ABP targets
at 20 weeks compared with Hispanic patients. In
addition, the proportions of Hispanic patients
attaining these same ABP targets were observed
to decrease from week 12 to week 20.
Reductions in mean ambulatory blood pressure.
Mean 24 h, daytime, and nighttime ambulatory
SBP and DBP were all significantly decreased
from baseline at week 12 and week 20 in both
Hispanic and non-Hispanic subgroups (Figures 6
and 7). The change in mean 24 h ABP (±SEM)
at week 12 (Figure 6) and week 20 (Figure 7) was
­16.6 (±1.8)/­10.8 (±1.3) mmHg and ­16.5
(±2.1)/­11.6 (±1.5) mmHg in Hispanic patients
and ­14.5 (±0.8)/­9.1 (±0.5) mmHg and ­21.6
(±0.9)/­13.5 (±0.6) mmHg in non-Hispanic
patients (Figures 6 and 7).
Mean changes in ambulatory SBP and DBP in
the last 2, 4, and 6 h of the dosing interval were
also all significantly decreased from baseline at
week 12 in Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients
(Figure 6). Similar results were observed at week
20 (Figure 7). For all ABP time points at week 12,
SBP and DBP reductions were greater in Hispanic
patients compared with non-Hispanic patients.
Conversely, with the exception of DBP during the
last 6 h, SBP and DBP reductions were greater in
non-Hispanic patients versus Hispanic patients at
week 20.
Safety and tolerability
Overall, the treatment regimen was well tolerated
in both Hispanic and non-Hispanic subgroups.
The proportion of Hispanic and non-Hispanic
patients experiencing any treatment-emergent
adverse event (TEAE) was 39.0% (n = 41) and
54.6% (n = 488), and the proportion experienc-
ing a drug-relatedTEAE was 20.0% (n = 21) and
26.2% (n = 234), respectively (Table 2). The
majority of TEAEs were mild to moderate in
severity, and the proportion of patients who
experienced aTEAE decreased with the addition
of HCTZ to AML/OM treatment. No serious
adverse events (SAEs) were reported in Hispanic
patients, whereas 1.3% (n = 12) of non-Hispanic
patients reported an SAE. None of these SAEs
were considered to be drug related.
A total of 4.8% (n = 5) of Hispanic patients and
7.2% (n = 64) of non-Hispanic patients discon-
tinued from the study due to a drug-related
TEAE. No deaths due to an adverse event were
reported. The most frequently reported drug-
related TEAEs in Hispanic and non-Hispanic
patients were peripheral edema and dizziness.
Peripheral edema occurred in 7.6% (n = 8) of
Hispanic patients and in 6.4% (n = 57) of non-
Hispanic patients, while dizziness occurred in
4.8% (n = 5) of Hispanic patients and in 7.9%
(n = 71) of non-Hispanic patients. The inci-
dence of drug-related hypotension was similar
and low in both the Hispanic and non-Hispanic
subgroups, that is, 1.9% (n = 2) and 2.3% (n =
21), respectively.
The incidence of drug-related peripheral edema
decreased with the addition of HCTZ in both the
Hispanic (from 6.7% to 2.9%) and non-Hispanic
(from 5.4% to 1.4%) subgroups.
Discussion
The results from this subgroup analysis of the
BP-CRUSH study demonstrate that an AML/
OM-based titration regimen was a well tolerated
means of effectively reducing BP and achieving
SeBP goals and ABP targets in Hispanic and non-
Hispanic patients with hypertension uncontrolled
on previous antihypertensive monotherapy. The
majority of patients achieved the primary end-
point of a cuff SBP of less than 140 mmHg (or
<130 mmHg in patients with diabetes) at week 12
on an AML/OM-based combination therapy reg-
imen. Combined SeBP goal rates (<140/90 or
<130/80 mmHg) were also achieved in a majority

of patients at weeks 12 and 20. SeBP goal rates at
both time points were slightly lower in Hispanic
patients (69.0% and 81.0%) versus non-Hispanic
patients (71.5% and 85.2%).
An effective antihypertensive agent should not
only reduce BP but should also provide BP con-
trol throughout the dosing interval. Data have
shown that the morning surge in BP resulting
from variations in the circadian rhythm of BP is
associated with an increased risk of cardiovascu-
lar events, particularly during the first 2 h after
awakening [Gosse et al. 2004].Thus, agents that
provide 24 h BP control play an important role
in potentially reducing cardiovascular events
and improving outcomes. Although there are no
guideline-approved ABP targets, the suggested
AHA 24 h, daytime, and nighttime ABP targets
(<130/80 mmHg, <135/85 mmHg, and <120/70
mmHg, respectively) were achieved at weeks 12
and 20 in a majority of Hispanic and non-Hispanic
patients in this subgroup analysis. Mean 24 h,
daytime, and nighttime ABP target rates achieved
at week 12 were similar in Hispanic and non-
Hispanic patients, with higher proportions of
Hispanic patients achieving these same targets;
however, greater proportions of non-Hispanic
patients had achieved these ABP targets compared
with the Hispanic subgroup at week 20. It should
be noted that the number of Hispanic patients who
underwent ABPM was small at 44.This may be one
possible explanation for the discrepancy observed
in week 12 and week 20 ABP target achievement
rates in Hispanic patients. Overall, mean SeBP and
mean 24 h, daytime, and nighttime ABP, and ABP
measured in the last 2, 4, and 6 h of the dosing
interval were all significantly reduced from baseline
at weeks 12 and 20 in all patients.
Fixed-dose combination therapy with AML/OM,
with or without HCTZ, was well tolerated in this
patient population; no new safety issues were
observed.The incidence of peripheral edema that
has been previously associated with CCB therapy
was expectedly highest in both the Hispanic and
non-Hispanic groups for the AML/OM combina-
tion. The addition of HCTZ decreased its inci-
dence in both cohorts, which was also reflected in
the decreased incidence of drug-related TEAEs
reported for the AML/OM + HCTZ treatment

group. Thus, these data support previous obser-
vations that the incorporation of a thiazide diu-
retic into a high-dose AML regimen can help to
reduce the incidence of edema. Although not
subject to statistical analysis, the incidence of
drug-related TEAEs appeared to be lower in
Hispanic patients compared with the non-Hispanic
population. Taken together, these data support
the utility of an AML/OM-based titration regimen
in providing well tolerated, 24 h BP control in
Hispanic patients with hypertension uncontrolled
on previous monotherapy.
Although guidelines advise that the use of at least
two antihypertensive agents will be necessary for
most patients to achieve BP goals in the seventh
report of the Joint National Committee on
Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment
of High Blood Pressure and in European guide-
lines [Chobanian et al. 2003; Mancia et al. 2007,
2009], this aspect of the guidelines is often not
well translated into clinical practice [Spranger
et al. 2004]. In addition to lack of awareness,
lack of access to treatment, and clinical inertia
[Cushman and Basile, 2006; Basile and Neutel,
2010], a main barrier to BP goal achievement
is patient non-adherence to treatment, which is
known to be associated with increasing pill burden
[Bangalore et al. 2007]. The development of
fixed-dose combinations such as AML/OM help
decrease pill burden, thereby potentially increasing
patient adherence to treatment and the likelihood
of BP goal achievement [Bangalore et al. 2007].
Treating to BP goal is important for all patients,
regardless of their ethnicity/race, in order to min-
imize adverse cardiovascular events [Chobanian
et al. 2003]. Analyses such as ours demonstrate
that high rates of BP control are achievable in
Hispanic patients; however, the difficulties lie in
translating goal rates achieved in clinical trials to
the real-world clinical setting [Singer et al. 2002;
Cushman and Basile, 2006].Treat-to-goal strate-
gies for hypertension management and initiatives
to improve awareness and treatment of hyperten-
sion have been shown to reduce the ethnic/racial
disparities in hypertension control by eliminating
some of the previously discussed barriers to BP
control [Singer et al. 2002; Manze et al. 2010;
Hebert et al. 2011].
Limitations of this subgroup analysis include the
open-label, single-arm design, possibly resulting
in treatment bias due to lack of blinding. For the
ABP data analysis, the number of patients in the
Hispanic subgroup was relatively small, and thus
these results need to be assessed with caution if
extrapolating to similar populations seen in the
clinical setting due to low statistical power. In
addition, potential gender effects on antihyper-
tensive efficacy were not assessed in this study
and it would be interesting to evaluate the effect
of gender in combination with ethnicity in future
studies. The strengths of this subgroup analysis
were that it was prespecified in the study protocol
and that it provides efficacy and safety data in a
subgroup of patients that is often under-reported
in the literature.
Conclusions
This prespecified subgroup analysis showed that
switching to a fixed-dose combination of AML/
OM ± HCTZ provided significant BP lowering
and effectively controlled BP to achieve SeSBP
and SeBP targets, as well as mean 24 h, daytime,
and nighttime ABP targets in a large proportion of
both Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients with
hypertension whose condition was previously
uncontrolled on antihypertensive monotherapy.
In addition to achieving SeBP goals and 24 h ABP
targets, the AML/OM ± HCTZ combination
therapy regimen was well tolerated in both
Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients.
