Most Americans have selenium intake rang-
ing from 60 to 220 µg/day (Combs 2001),
well above the recommended dietary allow-
ance of 55 µg/day (Institute of Medicine and
Panel on Dietary Antioxidants and Related
Compounds 2000; Rayman 2008). This high
level of intake, particularly compared with
other countries, is attributable to the high
soil content of selenium in several areas of
the United States, which is eventually incor-
porated in the food chain (Rayman 2008).
Although selenium is required for adequate
function of glutathione peroxidase and other
selenoproteins, the risk of selenium deficiency
in the U.S. general population is negligible.
Additional selenium intake at high intake
levels does not increase glutathione peroxi-
dase synthesis or activity, but rather increases
plasma selenium concentration by the non-
specific incorporation of selenomethionine
into plasma proteins (Institute of Medicine
and Panel on Dietary Antioxidants and
Related Compounds 2000), with unknown
health effects.
Bleys et al. (2007) reported a positive
association between serum selenium con-
centrations and the prevalence of diabetes
among participants in the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III). Stranges et al. (2007)
reported an increased risk of diabetes among
participants randomized to long-term sele-
nium supplementation (200 µg/day) in the
Nutritional Prevention of Cancer (NPC)
trial. Recently, the Selenium and Vitamin
E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), a
mega-trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of
selenium in preventing prostate cancer, was
prematurely stopped by the data and safety
monitoring committee because of lack of
benefit on the primary end point and the
possibility of an increased risk of diabetes in
the selenium-only arm (Lippman et al. 2009).
Additionally, high selenium status has been
linked with hypercholesterolemia (Bleys et al.
2008b) and hypertension (Laclaustra et al.
2009) in the U.S. population.
Because there is a narrow range between
selenium intake levels required for seleno-
protein synthesis and toxic levels (Institute of
Medicine and Panel on Dietary Antioxidants
and Related Compounds 2000), these find-
ings raise concerns of possible adverse cardio-
metabolic effects of high selenium exposure,
at least in selenium-replete populations such
as the United States. NHANES III and the
NPC trial, however, were conducted dur-
ing the 1980s and early 1990s, and there are
no recent data on the association of serum
selenium levels with diabetes in the United
States. The objective of this study was to
evaluate the association of serum selenium
concentrations with the prevalence of diabe-
tes using recently available NHANES data
collected in 2003­2004. Moreover, we also
evaluated the association between serum sele-
nium levels with fasting plasma glucose and
glycosylated hemoglobin levels, biomarkers
not previously considered.
Materials and Methods
NHANES is conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) using a
complex multistage sampling design to obtain
a probability sample of the civilian non
institutionalized U.S. population. We used
data from NHANES 2003­2004 (NCHS
2003­2004), the most recent release with
selenium data available in adults. Serum
selenium measurements were restricted to
participants  40 years of age (n = 3,299),
of whom 1,302 participated in the morning
examination and had a fasting blood sample.
Among these, 1,273 participants had serum
selenium measurements. To minimize the
possibility of reverse causation in the associa-
tions examined, we excluded participants with
self-reported coronary heart disease (n = 156),
stroke (n = 80), or cancer (n = 173), leaving
934 participants. We further excluded 16 par-
ticipants with missing body mass index (BMI)

Background: Increasing evidence suggests that high selenium levels are associated with diabetes
and other cardiometabolic risk factors.
Objectives: We evaluated the association of serum selenium concentrations with fasting plasma
glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and diabetes in the most recently available representative
sample of the U.S. population.
Methods: We used a cross-sectional analysis of 917 adults  40 years of age who had a fasting
morning blood sample in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003­2004. We
evaluated the association of serum selenium, measured by inductively coupled plasma-dynamic reac-
tion cell-mass spectrometry, and diabetes, defined as a self-report of current use of hypoglycemic
agents or insulin or as fasting plasma glucose  126 mg/dL.
Results: Mean serum selenium was 137.1 µg/L. The multivariable adjusted odds ratio [95% con-
fidence interval (CI)] for diabetes comparing the highest quartile of serum selenium ( 147 µg/L)
with the lowest (< 124 µg/L) was 7.64 (3.34­17.46). The corresponding average differences (95%
CI) in fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin were 9.5 mg/dL (3.4­15.6 mg/dL) and
0.30% (0.14­0.46%), respectively. In spline regression models, the prevalence of diabetes as well as
glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels increased with increasing selenium concentrations up to
160 µg/L.
Conclusions: In U.S. adults, high serum selenium concentrations were associated with higher
prevalence of diabetes and higher fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels. Given
high selenium intake in the U.S. population, further research is needed to determine the role of
excess selenium levels in the development or the progression of diabetes.

and 1 participant missing cotinine concentra-
tion. The final sample size was 917.
Serum selenium. Collection materials were
screened for potential selenium contamina-
tion. Serum selenium was measured at the
Trace Elements Laboratory at the Wadsworth
Center of the New York State Department of
Health (Albany, NY, USA) using inductively
coupled plasma­dynamic reaction cell­mass
spectrometry. The between-assay coefficients
of variation for quality control pooled sam-
ples analyzed throughout the duration of the
survey ranged from 2.5% to 2.9% (NCHS
2003­2004).
Glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and dia-
betes. Plasma glucose was measured from a
morning fasting sample of participants who
fasted 8­24 hr by the enzyme hexokinase
method (NCHS 2003­2004). Diabetes was
defined as the presence of either a self-report
of current use of hypoglycemic agents or insu-
lin or fasting plasma glucose  126 mg/dL.
Similar associations between selenium and
diabetes were found if the definition of diabe-
tes was based only on questionnaire or only on
fasting plasma glucose levels (data not shown).
Glycosylated hemoglobin measurements
were performed using the Primus CLC330
and Primus CLC385 boronate affinity high-
performance liquid chromatography systems
(Primus Corp., Kansas City, MO, USA). The
systems were standardized to the reference
method used for the Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial (DCCT; 1993). The
long-term interassay coefficient of variation
was < 3.0% (NCHS 2003­2004).
Other variables. Information on sex, age,
race/ethnicity, education, menopausal status,
smoking, and use of vitamin/mineral supple-
ments (as a single yes/no question, including
those supplements containing selenium) was
based on self-report. BMI was calculated by
dividing measured weight in kilograms by
measured height in meters squared. Serum
cotinine was measured by isotope-dilution
high-performance liquid chromatography/
atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tan-
dem mass spectrometry (NCHS 2003­2004).
Statistical methods. Participants were
divided into quartiles of serum selenium
concentration based on the weighted popu-
lation distribution. We used multivariable
linear regression to calculate adjusted means
for plasma glucose and glycosylated hemo-
globin differences and logistic regression to
calculate odds ratios (ORs) for diabetes com-
paring each quartile of serum selenium with
the lowest quartile. We used three models with
progressive degrees of adjustment. Model 1
was adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and
education. Model 2 was further adjusted for
BMI, smoking, cotinine, and menopausal sta-
tus. Model 3 was further adjusted for use of
vitamin/mineral supplements. Because ignor-
ing diabetes treatment may result in biased
estimates of the association between selenium
and glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin, we
conducted an additional analysis using cen-
sored linear regression (model 4) to correct
for the effect of medication for diabetes using
NHANES survey weights (Tobin et al. 2005).
Tests for linear trend were calculated by includ-
ing serum selenium as a continuous variable in
the models. To further explore the shape of the
relationship among serum selenium and plasma
glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and diabetes,
we used restricted quadratic splines with knots
at the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of the
serum selenium distribution. We also evaluated
the interactions between selenium (modeled as
quadratic restricted splines) and sex, age, race/
ethnicity, education, BMI, smoking status, or
use of vitamin/mineral supplements. Statistical
analyses were performed using weights specific
for the fasting morning sample in the survey
package in the R Statistical Software (version
2.6.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria) to account for the complex
sampling design and weights. Censored regres-
sion models were estimated using the cnreg
command in Stata Statistical Software (release
9.2; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA)
weighted for NHANES survey weights.
Results
The mean (± SD) serum selenium concen-
tration in the study population was 137.1 ±
19.9 µg/L. The overall prevalence of diabetes
was 10.0%. Participants with diabetes were
more likely to be older, male, and non-His-
panic black or Mexican American and to have
a higher BMI compared with participants
without diabetes (Table 1). Serum selenium
concentrations were positively associated with
age and with the use of vitamin/mineral sup-
plements, and inversely associated with cur-
rent smoking (Table 2). Men had higher mean
serum selenium than did women (138.6 vs.
135.9 µg/L). Non-Hispanic blacks had lower
mean serum selenium (129.0 µg/L) compared

with non-Hispanic whites (138.2 µg/L) and
with Mexican Americans (140.4 µg/L).
Mean serum selenium concentrations were
higher in participants with diabetes compared
with those without it (143.7 vs. 136.4 µg/L,
p = 0.001). The multivariable adjusted OR
[95% confidence interval (CI)] for diabe-
tes comparing the highest selenium quartile
( 147 µg/L) with the lowest (< 124 µg/L)
was 7.64 (95% CI, 3.34­17.46) (Table 3,
model 3). In spline regression models, the
prevalence of diabetes increased with increas-
ing selenium concentrations up to 160 µg/L
(Figure 1, left). Adjusted ORs for diabetes
comparing the 80th percentile (150 µg/L)
with the 20th (122 µg/L) percentile of the
selenium distribution showed consistent
findings across clinically relevant subgroups
(Figure 2).
In multivariable adjusted models, the
average differences (95% CI) comparing the
highest with the lowest selenium quartile
were 9.5 mg/dL (3.4­15.6 mg/dL) for fasting
plasma glucose, and 0.30% (0.14­0.46%) for
glycosylated hemoglobin (Table 3, model 3).
In spline regression models, levels of both
variables increased with increasing selenium
concentrations up to 160 µg/L (Figure 1,
center and right). Extending the definition
of diabetes to include all participants with
a previous doctor's diagnosis of diabetes
(including nontreated participants) or further
adjustment for waist circumference and fam-
ily history of diabetes produced similar results
(data not shown).
Discussion
In this representative cross-sectional study
of the U.S. population conducted in
2003­2004, high serum selenium concen-
trations were associated with a higher preva-
lence of diabetes, as well as with higher fasting
plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglo-
bin levels. These data are consistent with the
previous observation of an increased risk of
diabetes with high selenium concentrations
in NHANES III, conducted in 1988­1994
(Bleys et al. 2007). From 1988­1994 to
2003­2004, however, serum selenium con-
centrations among U.S. subjects  40 years
of age increased from 125.8 µg/L (95% CI,
124.1­127.6 µg/L) in NHANES III (n =
9,085) to 136.6 µg/L (134.4­138.7 µg/L)
in NHANES 2003­2004 (n = 2,903). This
increasing trend in serum selenium levels
highlights the importance of understanding
the association between serum selenium lev-
els and diabetes. Moreover, the NPC trial--
a randomized, double-blind clinical trial to
evaluate the efficacy of selenium supplemen-
tation (200 µg/day) for the prevention of
cancer--showed an increased risk of diabe-
tes after 7.7 years of follow-up (hazard ratio,
1.50; 95% CI, 1.03­2.33) comparing sele-
nium supplementation with placebo (Stranges
et al. 2007). Interestingly, the excess risk of

The first row for each outcome shows the unadjusted (survey-weighted) proportions (of diabetes) and averages (of plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin). Models 1­3 used
multiple linear or logistic regression models with survey weights, strata, and clusters to account for complex survey design. Model 4 used censored regression with survey weights
only. For results related to the prevalence of diabetes, prevalence ORs are not equivalent to prevalence ratios. To illustrate this difference, the prevalence ratios for diabetes compar-
ing quartiles 2­4 versus the first quartile for model 3, estimated using marginal standardization, were 2.73, 3.05, and 5.32, respectively.

multivariable linear regression models were adjusted for sex, age, race, education, BMI, smoking, cotinine, postmenopausal status, and use of vitamin and min-
eral supplements (model 3). The odds for diabetes and the values of the continuous variables at the 20th percentile (122 µg/L) of the serum selenium distribution

diabetes with selenium supplementation in
the NPC trial was restricted to participants in
the highest tertile of plasma selenium at base-
line (> 121.6 µg/L). More recently, SELECT,
a large randomized clinical trial to evaluate
the efficacy of selenium supplements (200 µg/
day) on prostate cancer prevention, found
more cases of diabetes in the group taking
only selenium compared with placebo (rela-
tive risk, 1.07; 99% CI, 0.94­1.22; p = 0.16)
but not in the selenium plus vitamin E group
(relative risk, 0.97; 99% CI, 0.85­1.11; p =
0.62) (Lippman et al. 2009).
Our findings are consistent with recent
reports from several U.S. studies of posi-
tive associations of selenium concentrations
with lipid levels (Bleys et al. 2008b) and with
hypertension (Laclaustra et al. 2009), as well
as of Ushaped relationships with cardiovas-
cular end points (Bleys et al. 2008a, 2009;
Flores-Mateo et al. 2006; Salvini et al. 1995).
Given the high selenium exposure in the
United States, the mechanisms underlying
these associations need to be investigated.
The high soil content of selenium in sev-
eral areas of the United States and the use of
supplements (Rayman 2008) explain the high
mean selenium concentration in our sam-
ple (137 µg/L). This level is high compared
with selenium needs for optimizing seleno-
protein synthesis and activity (Institute of
Medicine and Panel on Dietary Antioxidants
and Related Compounds 2000) and rela-
tive to selenium levels in other populations
(Rayman 2008). Glutathione peroxidases
synthesis plateaus above serum selenium
levels of 70­90 µg/L (Combs 2001). Above
this threshold, serum selenium levels do not
correlate with glutathione peroxidase activ-
ity or with mRNA synthesis for a variety of
selenoproteins, but reflect variation in sele-
nomethionine that is incorporated nonspe-
cifically in serum proteins, mainly in albumin
(Institute of Medicine and Panel on Dietary
Antioxidants and Related Compounds 2000),
with unknown physiologic activity. Because
only one participant in our sample had serum
selenium levels < 90 µg/L, variability in serum
selenium levels is unlikely to reflect underly-
ing variation in selenoprotein levels.
Many other countries, including most
of Europe, have substantially lower serum
selenium levels (mean values < 100 µg/L)
(Rayman 2000), mainly due to poorer soil
content, so our findings may not extrapolate
to them. In an observational analysis of the
Supplementation with Antioxidant Vitamins
and Minerals trial (SU.VI.MAX) conducted
in France, plasma selenium concentration at
baseline (mean, 87 µg/L) was positively asso-
ciated with fasting plasma glucose at baseline
and after 7.5 years of follow-up (Czernichow
et al. 2006). However, no differences
in fasting glucose levels were found in the
randomized component of the trial, compar-
ing a multivitamin supplement that included
100 µg/day of selenium versus placebo over
the follow-up (Czernichow et al. 2006). In a
cross-sectional analysis of the French Etude
du Viellissement Artérial (EVA), Coudray
et al. (1997) found no statistically significant
correlations between plasma selenium (mean,
87 µg/L) and fasting plasma glucose or diabe-
tes prevalence. Finally, a small cross-sectional
study of Asian persons residing in Singapore
also found similar mean serum selenium levels
among participants with and without diabetes
(Hughes et al. 1998).
An excess of reactive oxygen species may
increase insulin resistance and affect pancre-
atic cell function (Houstis et al. 2006), and
some selenium compounds such as selenite
and methylselenol (a metabolite of selenom-
ethionine) (Rayman 2005) can induce oxi-
dative stress (Drake 2006; Spallholz 1994;
Spallholz et al. 2004). However, whereas sub-
stantial attention has been paid to explain the
mechanisms for a potential benefit of increas-
ing serum selenium in low-selenium intake
populations, the mechanistic explanation
for the effects of selenium above the levels
required to maximize glutathione peroxidase
activity is largely unexplored. Further experi-
mental and epidemiologic research is needed
to explain the mechanisms underlying the
observed associations between high selenium
exposure and cardiometabolic risk factors.
Higher selenium concentrations were
associated with some diabetes risk factors
such as increasing age. In contrast, selenium
concentrations decreased with higher BMI,
which is one of the stronger diabetes risk
factors. The associations of selenium and dia-
betes reported were adjusted for these risk
factors, reducing the possibility that the
association between selenium and diabetes is
driven by differences in established diabetes
risk factors across selenium levels.
The strengths of our study come from the
rigorous sampling design, the quality of the
study measurements, and the representative-
ness of the NHANES sample. Among its
limitations, the cross-sectional design restricts
our ability to evaluate the temporality of the
observed association. It is possible that high
serum selenium levels are related to body
weight. Nevertheless, the observed associa-
tion persisted after adjusting for BMI as well
as for use of multivitamin/mineral supple-
ments. The use of a single measurement of
serum selenium may not reflect completely
the known high within-person variability
(Longnecker et al. 1993) and does not pro-
vide information on selenium metabolism.
A cross-sectional analysis of a subsample of
the Health Professionals Follow-up Study
found an inverse association between toenail
selenium levels and the prevalence of diabetes

splines with nodes at the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles. Multivariable logistic regression models were
adjusted for sex, age, race, education, BMI, smoking, cotinine, postmenopausal status, and use of vitamin
and mineral supplements (model 3). The size of the square indicates the number of participants in each
stratum. p-Values correspond to tests for interaction between selenium splines and selected participant

Selenium and diabetes in NHANES 2003­2004

(Rajpathak et al. 2005). Serum and toenail
selenium are both biomarkers of selenium
intake but are likely to reflect different sele-
nium compartments. Toenail selenium could
represent a longer trend of selenium intake
than serum selenium, but there are no data
supporting the grounds of their differences.
More detailed analysis of different seleno-
proteins and related activities are needed to
better understand the association of selenium
with diabetes.
Conclusions
In summary, high serum selenium concen-
trations were associated with higher preva-
lence of diabetes in a representative survey
of U.S. adults conducted in 2003­2004.
These findings are consistent with an earlier
NHANES survey conducted in 1988­1994.
Furthermore, these findings are supported by
randomized evidence from the NPC trial and
SELECT indicating that selenium supple-
mentation may increase the risk of diabetes
in selenium-replete populations such as that
of the United States. High selenium concen-
trations have also been linked to increased
lipid levels (Bleys et al. 2008b) and hyper-
tension (Laclaustra et al. 2009). Given the
current diabetes epidemic, the high selenium
intake from naturally occurring selenium in
U.S. soil, and the popularity of multivitamin/
mineral supplements containing selenium
in the United States, these findings call for
a thorough evaluation of the risks and ben-
efits associated with high selenium status in
the United States. Furthermore, our findings
suggest that selenium supplements should
not be used in the United States until there is
a better understanding of their potential risks
and benefits.
