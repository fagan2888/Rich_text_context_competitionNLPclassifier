Abstract Erythropoietin has transformed the treatment of
the anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by preventing
the need for blood transfusions and improving the quality
of life in all patients, including children. Anemia in
children, in the age group 1­19 years, may be defined as
hemoglobin (Hgb) levels <12.1­13.5 g/dl for boys and <
11.4­11.5 g/dl for girls, based on the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) norms. The
prevalence of anemia in children ranges from 31.2% in
stage 1 CKD to 93.3% in stages 4 and 5 CKD. The recent
publication of trials evaluating the optimal hemoglobin
level in adult CKD patients has generated considerable
uncertainty about the target Hgb level in children with
CKD. It is unclear whether generalizing of results from
these trials in adults to children is appropriate. Adequately
powered, randomized, controlled studies have not been
conducted on children, and none to our knowledge are
currently planned. The Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) offers scant guidance on the Hgb target level for
children, other than implying that it should be no different
from that for adults. The purpose of this editorial is to
critically scrutinize whether there is a benefit to the
normalization of anemia in children with CKD and whether
adoption of the results from adult studies is appropriate.

The benefits and risks of normalizing the hemoglobin
level for children with chronic kidney disease
Proponents of the normalization of hemoglobin levels in
chronic kidney disease (CKD) have argued for the diverse
benefits of correcting anemia in children. These benefits
include improvements in quality of life, cognitive function,
exercise capacity, scholastic performance, growth and
nutrition, and cardiovascular function [1]. Quality of life
(QOL) and its components have frequently been used as
surrogate outcome measures for children, since they
influence physical performance, exercise tolerance, and
even school attendance. However, studies demonstrating
these benefits have largely been small in sample size, non-
randomized in design, of short duration, and have used non-
validated instruments [2­5]. In a multi-center interventional
trial that evaluated intelligence quotient (IQ) using the
Weschler intelligence test, treatment of anemia was associ-
ated with a significant increase in IQ [6]. However, the
design was limited by a single-arm and a sample size of
only 22 children with CKD. With respect to growth, many
trials have demonstrated a lack of effect of anemia
correction on growth in children with CKD [1]. Recent
studies have not only demonstrated a high prevalence of
growth retardation in children with chronic kidney disease
but have also suggested that initial hemoglobin (Hgb) level
and early treatment with erythropoietin is associated with
improved growth [7]. While these studies have limitations,
including retrospective design and small numbers (47
children), they have been influential in supporting normal-
ization of Hgb level in children with CKD. The evidence

for improvement in cardiovascular co-morbidity in children
with treatment of anemia rests on the results of a single,
randomized, placebo-controlled trial comprised of only 11
children undergoing dialysis. In that study, patients were
assigned to therapy with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents
(ESAs) or to placebo for 24 weeks. ESA therapy was
associated with partial correction of an elevated cardiac
index at 6 months and a significant reduction in left
ventricular mass at 12 months [8]. The subjects in that
study were severely anemic, with baseline Hgb of 7.3 g/dl.
It was suggested that these data were concordant with those
from two observational studies providing further resonance
to the importance of anemia treatment [9]. A recent study
examined 677 adolescents on hemodialysis for the rela-
tionship between Hgb level and the risk for death or
hospitalization [10]. Patients with Hgb 11 g/dl consistently
demonstrated a 60% to 70% decrease in the risk of death.
However, mortality was similar for patients with Hgb levels
of 11 g/dl to 12 g/dl and >12 g/dl when compared with
those with Hgb <10 g/dl, and no significant difference in
risk for hospitalization was observed between the various
Hgb categories. Warady and Ho, using data from the North
American Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study
(NAPRTCS), reported an association between a baseline
hematocrit less than 33% at 30 days after initiation of
dialysis and increased risk for prolonged hospitalization and
death in patients with incident end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) who were younger than 18 years of age [11]. A
study by Furth et al. suggested an association of greater
decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with hematocrit
less than 36%, reiterating the importance of correction of
anemia [12].
Balanced against the potential benefits of epoetin in
correcting CKD are the risks of hypertension, thrombosis
and atherosclerosis [13]. Exacerbation of hypertension has
been reported by several authors in both non-dialysis CKD
and children on dialysis [14­19]. However, many of the
studies excluded children with moderate or uncontrolled
hypertension, either before or during the trial period. Vaziri
and co-workers, in both humans and animal models, have
explored the mechanism of hypertension. Vaziri has
suggested that erythropoietin-induced hypertension is a
nitric oxide-mediated complication [20]. Consequently, the
use of lower doses of epoetin (approximately 150 U/kg per
week) is recommended. In light of studies supporting a
prothrombotic potential of epoetin in children, it has been
suggested that epoetin administration be deferred for at
least 2 weeks after surgery for arteriovenous (AV) fistula to
prevent fistula thrombosis [13, 14, 21].
The mechanism by which epoetin might increase
cardiovascular risk remains unclear, even though studies
in the adult CKD and dialysis population demonstrate either
no benefit or increased cardiac events and mortality when
higher doses of epoetin are used to achieve a higher Hgb
concentration [22­24]. The reason for the higher incidence
of adverse events remains obscure; however, the presence
of erythropoietin receptors in organs other than the bone
marrow, such as the vascular endothelium, the myocardium,
the kidneys, and the central nervous system, raises the
possibility that there may be non-erythropoetic effects of
erythropoietin that might explain the adverse risk [20, 25].
Since there have been no large randomized controlled
trials in children, the correction of the risk of anemia in
children is largely based on extrapolation from adult
randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two RCTs have been
cited by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in their
black box warning: one in hemodialysis patients--the
Normal Hematocrit study (NHS), and the other in non-
dialysis patients--the Correction of Hgb and Outcomes in
Renal Insufficiency (CHOIR) study. The NHS trial ran-
domly assigned 1,223 symptomatic hemodialysis patients
to a hematocrit of 42% versus 30% with high-dose and
lower-dose epoetin treatment, respectively [24]. Patients
were considered to be at high risk of cardiovascular disease,
because they were required to have congestive heart failure
or ischemic heart disease on enrollment. The primary
endpoint was the length of time to death or a first non-
fatal myocardial infarction. The study was terminated early
by the data monitoring committee, at the third interim
analysis, because of the higher risk observed in patients
randomly assigned to the higher hematocrit arm of the trial.
The study demonstrated increased risk for patients assigned
to the higher hematocrit [relative risk (RR) of 1.3]. The
study also reported a higher rate of vascular thrombosis in
patients treated to the higher hematocrit. However, the
study did not address the benefit or harm of maintaining
hematocrit between 30% and 42%. The CHOIR study was
an open-label, randomized trial that studied 1,432 patients
with non-dialysis CKD across 131 centers in the USA; 715
patients were randomly assigned to receive epoetin alpha
targeted to achieve an Hgb level of 13.5 g/dl, and 717 were
randomly selected to receive epoetin alpha targeted to
achieve an Hgb level of 11.3 g/dl [22]. Eligibility criteria
included age > 18 years and an estimated GFR of 15­
50 ml/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area. The primary
endpoint was a composite of death, myocardial infarction,
congestive heart failure (CHF) hospitalization (excluding
hospitalization during which renal replacement therapy
occurred) and stroke. Secondary endpoints included the
components of the primary endpoint, as well as cardiovas-
cular and total hospitalizations, QOL and the time-to-
dialysis. There were 222 composite events: 125 in the high
Hgb group and 97 in the low Hgb group [P=0.03, hazard
ratio (HR) 1.34; with 95% confidence interval of 1.03 and
1.74]. The higher rate of composite events was explained
largely by a higher rate of death (48% higher risk, P=0.07)
432 Pediatr Nephrol (2009) 24:431­434
or CHF hospitalization (41%, P=0.07). The QOL improved
in both groups but did not differ significantly. These trials
were supported by a recent meta-analysis that concluded
that, when an Hgb level > 12 g/d is aimed for, there is a
17% higher risk of mortality. The higher mortality was
attributed to higher risk of cardiovascular complications
[26]. Despite these studies in adults, higher doses of epoetin
are being used in children to achieve normalization of
hematocrit based on data from the NAPRTCS 2001 and
2004 registry reports [27]. In this report, younger children
are being given higher doses of erythropoietin (EPO), with
infants requiring the highest dose, ranging from 275 U/kg
per week to 350 U/kg per week [28].
Recommendations for the optimal Hgb level in children
Based on RCTs in adults and largely observational studies
in children, an opinion-based minimum Hgb level of 11 g/
dl has been recommended by the European Pediatric
Peritoneal Dialysis Working Group (EPPWG) and National
Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcome Quality
Initiative (NKF-K/DOQI) with the rationale of improved
quality of life and better survival [2, 29, 30]. In addition,
the EPPWG has recommended the use of iron as an adjunct
to epoetin in the treatment of anemia. Studies of adults have
also suggested that, among adult patients suffering inflam-
mation and on permanent hemodialysis, when an increase
in the dose of epoetin is contemplated, administration of 1 g
of ferric gluconate is effective in improving hemoglobin
levels [31, 32]. The EPPWG did not recommend an upper
limit for the Hgb level, while NKF-K/DOQI has most
recently suggested that Hgb levels should be 11 to 12 g/dl
[29, 30]. The FDA has most recently stated that the optimal
Hgb level in adults (and children) with CKD should be in
the 10 g/dl to 12 g/dl range. The optimal target level of Hgb
in children is compounded by the age-related variation in
defining the normal Hgb concentration and, consequently,
the anemic range [33]. Additionally, the variability in Hgb
concentration--a phenomenon called Hgb cycling--results
in quite considerable difficulty in maintaining Hgb targets
between 11 g/dl and 12 g/dl. Hgb cycling is defined as a
non-physiological oscillation or periodic fluctuation in the
Hgb level by more than 1.5 g/dl from an equilibrium point.
Over 90% of adult hemodialysis patients demonstrate at
least one Hgb cycle in a year [34]. To our knowledge,
hemoglobin cycling has not been studied in children.
In conclusion, there are limited data that address the
hemoglobin target levels in children with CKD. Since
children have important physiologic differences from
adults, and since the effects of the complications of CKD,
including anemia, may be different in children than in
adults, RCTs in children are desperately needed. However,
until randomized controlled studies of children with CKD
are conducted, adult studies should help guide the decision
in children. At this point we recommend aiming for an Hgb
level of 10 g/dl to 12 g/dl in children, commensurate with
the FDA guidelines.
