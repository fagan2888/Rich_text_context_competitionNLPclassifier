Neighborhood fast food restaurants and fast food
consumption: A national study

Abstract
Background: Recent studies suggest that neighborhood fast food restaurant availability is related to greater
obesity, yet few studies have investigated whether neighborhood fast food restaurant availability promotes fast
food consumption. Our aim was to estimate the effect of neighborhood fast food availability on frequency of fast
food consumption in a national sample of young adults, a population at high risk for obesity.
Methods: We used national data from U.S. young adults enrolled in wave III (2001-02; ages 18-28) of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n = 13,150). Urbanicity-stratified multivariate negative binomial regression
models were used to examine cross-sectional associations between neighborhood fast food availability and
individual-level self-reported fast food consumption frequency, controlling for individual and neighborhood
characteristics.
Results: In adjusted analysis, fast food availability was not associated with weekly frequency of fast food
consumption in non-urban or low- or high-density urban areas.
Conclusions: Policies aiming to reduce neighborhood availability as a means to reduce fast food consumption
among young adults may be unsuccessful. Consideration of fast food outlets near school or workplace locations,
factors specific to more or less urban settings, and the role of individual lifestyle attitudes and preferences are
needed in future research.

Background
Neighborhood availability of fast food restaurants has
recently received considerable attention as a target to pre-
vent obesity [1-6]. It is intuitive that fast food restaurants
contribute to obesity by promoting fast food consumption.
However, few studies have tested the relationship between
access to fast food and diet behavior and those that have
rely on measures of fruit and vegetable intake [7-9]. Find-
ings from an even smaller literature that investigates direct
relationships with fast food consumption are mixed
[10-12].
Furthermore, most evidence focuses on urban popula-
tions, with little research in suburban or rural populations.
One of the difficulties is that urbanicity is often classified
according to population density [13], which may correlate
with cultural or social influences on diet and thus obscure
important heterogeneity across urban, suburban and rural
areas. Because the nature of accessibility in suburban or
rural environments differ from urban environments, and
other social, environmental, and individual influences of
diet behavior may differ according to urbanicity, residen-
tial fast food restaurant availability may influence fast food
consumption differently in rural, suburban, and urban
contexts. Therefore, we hypothesize that the relationship
between chain fast food availability with fast food con-
sumption varies by urbanicity. In most existing research,
generalizability across multiple contexts and comparisons
by urbanicity are not possible due to small sample sizes
and constrained geographic areas.
Additionally, variation in and limitations of neighbor-
hood fast food availability measures may contribute to
inconsistent and sometimes counterintuitive findings.

Measures capturing fast food restaurants within a
straight line (Euclidean) distance may obscure realistic
proximity through usual routes of travel along roadways
[6]. In contrast, network buffers, the polygon shaped by
the street network up to a given distance, represent
access to resources relative to the street network [14].
Whereas the count (or number) of fast food restaurants
within a given area does not take into account popula-
tion density and development, which are correlated with
neighborhood food resource availability and indepen-
dently related to dietary behavior [15]. Conceptually,
greater density of food resources per capita may repre-
sent greater quantity and diversity of restaurant choices
that may, in turn, influence decision for where and
when to eat outside of the home. Fast food restaurant
density per population [16,17] may therefore capture
population density or serve as a proxy for physical
development density. Alternatively, a roadway-scaled
measure that represents the concentration of fast food
outlets along access routes may help account for differ-
ences in fast food restaurant counts according to the
amount of commercial activity.
We used national data from 13,150 sociodemographi-
cally diverse young adults living throughout the U.S to test
the hypothesis that individuals living in neighborhoods
with greater chain fast food availability report more fre-
quent fast food consumption. We improve on prior fast
food availability measures by examining fast food restau-
rants per roadway mile within 3 km street network dis-
tance from each respondent home, with sensitivity analysis
comparing to measures used in published research. Capi-
talizing on the size and geographic scope of our study, we
investigated how the association between fast food avail-
ability and consumption varies by urbanicity.
Methods
Study population and data sources
Our study sample is derived from respondents aged 18 to
28 years who participated in Wave III (2001-02) of the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add
Health), a nationally representative, prospective cohort
study of adolescents representative of the U.S. school-
based population in grades 7 to 12 (11-22 years of age) in
1994-95 followed into adulthood. The Wave I Add Health
study population (n = 20,745) was obtained through a sys-
tematic random sample of 80 high schools and 52 middle
schools in the United States, stratified to ensure that the
schools were representative of US schools with respect to
region, urbanicity, school type, percentage of white stu-
dents, and school size [18]. Respondents were followed
through Wave II (n = 14,738, 1996) and Wave III (n =
15,197). Add Health included a core sample plus subsam-
ples of selected minority and other groupings collected
under protocols approved by the Institutional Review
Board at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
The survey design and sampling frame have been dis-
cussed elsewhere [18,19].
We used the Add Health Obesity and Neighborhood
Environment database (ONEdata), a Geographic Informa-
tion System that linked time-varying, community-level
data to Add Health respondent Wave III home addresses
geocoded with street-segment matches (n = 13,039), global
positioning system (GPS) measurements (n = 1,204), and
ZIP/ZIP+4/ZIP+2 centroid match (n = 685) among 14,322
Wave III respondents with sample weights. Residential
locations were linked to attributes of areas within 1,3,5,
and 8 km straight line distance (Euclidean neighborhood
buffer) and through the street network (street network
neighborhood buffer) surrounding each wave-specific
respondent residence; and block group, tract, and county
attributes from time-matched U.S. Census and other data,
which were merged with individual-level Add Health
interview responses [20]. The number of census block
groups (n = 7,588) represents 3.6% of block groups
included in the 2000 U.S. Census.
Of 14,322 Wave III respondents with sample weights,
we excluded those reporting disability or pregnancy and
Native Americans (due to sparse data) (n = 582). Remain-
ing respondents missing individual and geographic data
were also excluded (n = 590), leaving an analytic sample of
13,150. The analytic sample had higher parental income,
had fewer children, were more likely to own a vehicle, and
lived in more highly educated and lower poverty neighbor-
hoods compared to those excluded for missing data.
Study variables
Fast food intake
Weekly frequency of fast food consumption was ascer-
tained from the question: "On how many of the past
seven days did you eat food from a fast food place
McDonalds, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut, Taco
Bell, or a local fast food restaurant?"
GIS-derived neighborhood fast food availability data
Neighborhood fast food restaurant data were obtained
from a commercial dataset of U.S. businesses corre-
sponding to the Wave III interview period (2001). Fast
food restaurants include a wide range of quick service
establishments providing generally premade food and lit-
tle table service; they include traditional burger outlets as
well as delicatessens and coffee shops. To capture a more
homogenous, well-defined category, we examined only
chain fast food restaurants (e.g., McDonald's or Pizza
Hut), classified according to the 8-digit Standard Indus-
trial Classification (SIC) code 58120307 (fast-food restau-
rant, chain).
Kilometers of secondary/connecting and local, neigh-
borhood and rural roads were obtained from StreetMap
Pro (July 2003, v.5.2) data from Environmental Systems

Research Institute (ESRI, http://www.esri.com) in Red-
lands, CA. We defined fast food availability as the num-
ber of chain fast food restaurants per 100 kilometer of
roadway within a 3 km network buffer to account for
differences in fast food restaurant counts according to
the amount of commercial activity in an area. Our
research with Add Health and a similar large population
study suggests that restaurant proximity within a 3 km
buffer is the most appropriate distance for examining
associations between neighborhood fast food restaurant
availability and individual level behavior [21,22].
Urbanicity
U.S. Census-defined urbanized areas (UA) were used to
classify residential locations as non-urban (outside UA) or
urban (inside UA). Urban locations were further distin-
guished as 1) low density [95% (75th percentile) devel-
oped land cover] and 2) high density [> 95% developed
land cover] urban areas based on the area of developed
land as a proportion of total area within 3 km after exclud-
ing water and ice (calculated using Fragstats software with
U.S. Geologic Survey National Landcover Data). Our mea-
sure of developed land cover provides an indicator of
urban development that is independent of population den-
sity, which may correlate with cultural or social influences
on diet, and correctly classifies areas as within or outside
of a UA (Receiver Operating Characteristic curve area =
0.937). Region was defined as Midwest, West, South, or
Northeast.
GIS-derived neighborhood sociodemographics
We examined neighborhood sociodemographic character-
istics within 2000 U.S. Census block groups because they
more likely adhere to individually perceived neighborhood
boundaries [23,24] and are more sociodemographically
homogeneous than larger units. Using the federal defini-
tion of "poverty area" [25,26], we dichotomized neighbor-
hood poverty into > 20% or 20% of population below the
federal poverty level. We defined neighborhood-level edu-
cation as percent of persons 25 years with a college
degree. We obtained population density per squared kilo-
meter by using Census block-group population count,
weighted according to the proportion of block-group area
within the 3 km neighborhood buffer, after excluding
water and ice, and divided by the area.
Individual characteristics
We adjusted for the following individual characteristics:
race, age, parental income (> $36,000), employment sta-
tus, has any children, vehicle ownership ("has a car/
motorcycle/van"). We included parental rather than the
young adults' own education (> high school) because
parental SES is shown to be a strong predictor of obe-
sity and obesity-related behaviors [27-29] during the
complex transitional stage of young adulthood [30,31]
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were carried out using Stata ver-
sion 10.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX). Descriptive
characteristics were calculated within each urban strata.
In multivariable analysis, we used negative binomial
regression to model individual-level, self-reported fast
food consumption (days eating fast food in last week) as
a function of neighborhood-level fast food restaurants
per 100 kilometer roadway within 3 km network buffers,
controlling for neighborhood sociodemographics, indivi-
dual characteristics, and region. We hypothesized a
priori that the association between fast food availability
and fast food consumption is different across non-
urban, low density urban, and high density urban areas.
Because fast food outlets and neighborhood sociodemo-
graphics varied dramatically across urbanicity and thus
limited comparability across sociodemographic and geo-
graphic subpopulations, we stratified by urbanicity to
avoid structural confounding [32].
Our preference was to use consistent restaurant avail-
ability measures for all strata, but the alternative specifi-
cations yielded invalid estimates because they violated
model assumptions and/or were highly unstable. For
example, nearly 100% of the high density urban respon-
dents had at least one fast food restaurant within 3 km
of their home, so the dichotomous measure was
unstable and relied on 60 observations. In contrast,
approximately 70% of non-urban respondents had no
fast food restaurants within 3 km, resulting in a highly
skewed distribution of fast food availability and hetero-
skedasticity in our models. Thus, these distributions
necessitated different measures across strata of urbani-
city. We analyzed fast food availability as a continuous
variable for low and high density urban strata and as a
dichotomous measure (any versus none) for the non-
urban stratum. Statistical interactions between fast food
availability and vehicle ownership, poverty, and sex were
not significant (p > 0.10) and therefore excluded from
all models. We tested higher order relationships for all
continuous variables and included where statistically sig-
nificant (p < 0.05).
Parental selection of a neighborhood may be influenced
by preferences or constraints related directly or indirectly
to the area's food resources and diet behaviors, which
may cluster within school populations. Thus, to address
our concern that unobserved factors associated with fast
food consumption might be associated with neighbor-
hood choice and school at baseline (Wave I), we tested
baseline school indicator variables in the models using a
Hausman-like test [33], which indicated that the school
indicator variables were necessary (p < 0.05). Thus, we
include school indicator variables in our models to cap-
ture long lasting unobservable influences on individual

decisions even after the individual leaves their place of
residence at wave I.
Buffer-based fast food availability measures were indivi-
dual-level variables. While block groups used for neigh-
borhood-level control variables could comprise a third
level in multilevel analysis, we did not perform multilevel
modeling because census unit boundaries did not corre-
spond with school catchment areas, so schools and census
units were not hierarchically related. Therefore, analyzing
census units as higher levels in multi-level models was not
possible while controlling for school indicators, the pri-
mary sampling unit for Add Health. Furthermore, census
block groups contained sparse, unbalanced numbers of
respondents (mean 1.9, range 1-57 respondents), which
can lead to bias in non-linear multi-level models, and clus-
tering within census block groups was minimal (0.08 intra-
class correlation for reported fast food consumption). We
do, however, include school indicator variables in the
models, which correct for school-level clustering and
account for survey design.
Sensitivity Analysis
We evaluated the sensitivity of our findings to the follow-
ing aspects of our fast food availability measure (count of
chain fast food restaurants per 100 kilometer roadway
within 3 km street network buffers): (1) the variable used
for scaling (roadway km vs. population), (2) network vs.
Euclidean buffers, and (3) 1 km vs. 3 km buffers, and (4)
total (chain and non-chain) vs. chain fast food restaurants.
Corresponding alternative variables included (1) chain fast
food restaurant counts per 10,000 population within 3 km
Euclidean (straight-line) buffers (population counts were
derived from 2000 US Census block-group population
count weighted according to the proportion of block-
group area within the neighborhood buffer); chain fast
food restaurant counts per 100 kilometer roadway within
(2) 3 km Euclidean buffers and (3) 1 km network buffers;
and (4) total fast food (chain and non-chain) restaurant
counts per 100 kilometer roadway within 3 km street net-
work buffers.
We repeated our multivariable analysis using each of
the four alternative fast food availability measures. Few
non-urban and low density urban areas had any fast
food restaurants within the 1 km network buffer (8%
and 25%, respectively); therefore, we analyzed fast food
availability within 1 km in high density urban areas only.
Results
Our diverse national sample of 13,150 young adults
reflects a variety of individual sociodemographic and
neighborhood differences by urbanicity. In general,
respondents of racial/ethnic minority lived in greater
proportion in high density urban areas (Table 1). Job-
lessness and car ownership among respondents was
highest in non-urban areas (Table 1). All neighborhood-
level characteristics differed across urban strata (Table 2).
Fast food availability was not associated with reported
fast food consumption in non-urban, low density urban,
or high density urban areas after controlling for individual
and neighborhood characteristics (Table 3). In general,
estimated associations were not sensitive to alternative
definitions of fast food availability: the total fast food mea-
sure and chain fast food measures scaled by population
and within different neighborhood buffers yielded similarly
small and precise estimates. However, findings suggest
that estimates may be sensitive to measure differences
within the context of high density urban areas. A few esti-
mates approached marginal significance but in inconsis-
tent directions.
Discussion
In contrast with our hypothesis, we found that neighbor-
hood fast food availability was not related to fast food
consumption in our large, national sample of young
adults residing in neighborhoods throughout the U.S.
Our findings suggest that targeting neighborhood fast
food availability may not reduce consumption or obesity
among young U.S. adults.
Our findings, of no relationship between fast food avail-
ability on fast food consumption among adults, are consis-
tent with prior research [11,34]. One study reports a
positive association between fast food availability and fast
food consumption, but only among a subset of 404 adults
living in Montreal who were "reward sensitive" [10].
Null results may reflect: (1) that young adults more
often purchase and consume fast food in settings other
than their residential neighborhoods, such as school or
workplace locations, (2) that lifestyle factors such as family
structure or employment status are stronger determinants
of fast food consumption [35-37] or (3) the possibility that
unmeasured neighborhood and social preferences, such as
location selection factors, more strongly influence dietary
behaviors. That is, the social, economic, cultural factors
that affect where a person is able or wishes to live may
also influence dietary behaviors [38]. Much would be
gained by broadening research to focus on environmental
contexts beyond the residential location, such as college
and workplace neighborhoods as well as commuting
routes. In addition, future research should incorporate
other neighborhood- and individual-level factors to deter-
mine which settings and individual and neighborhood
characteristics are most salient for dietary behaviors.
The majority of published research has focused on the
indirect relationship between fast food availability and
obesity, rather than investigating direct effects on fast
food consumption. Greater neighborhood fast food avail-
ability is consistently related to higher obesity [1,3,39,40]
yet it is possible that this relationship reflects processes

other than higher fast food consumption. In particular,
fast food restaurants may cluster with other environmen-
tal characteristics that influence obesity [20,41]. For
example, automobile access may be important for fast
food restaurants because of their dependence on drive-
thru business. Therefore, neighborhoods with more fast
food restaurants may promote obesity as a result of dom-
inating road structures that hinder active transportation.
Our findings that neighborhood fast food availability is
unrelated to fast food consumption suggest that associa-
tions between fast food availability and obesity may
reflect this or similar processes.
Our study expands current literature by comparing fast
food restaurants scaled by roadway kilometers within a
street network buffer - a measure of availability that
improves upon widely used restaurant count measures by
accounting for urban development and street access -
across multiple geographic and sociodemographic char-
acteristics. We present data from a large sample of U.S.
young adults that uses a more refined urban/rural classi-
fication than the traditional urban/rural dichotomy.
Furthermore, we observed vast differences in the avail-
ability of fast food for non-urban compared to urban
respondents. While these differences precluded the use
of comparable availability measures across urbanicity
levels, they suggest that the built environment may oper-
ate quite differently in rural, suburban, and urban areas,
and thus may necessitate different measurement
approaches. This might also underlie some of the mixed
findings in the literature [10-12].
Strengths and limitations
We present data from a unique and large national cohort
that includes a variety of detailed environmental data com-
bined with individual-level diet data in a cohort of young
adults from around the U.S. To our knowledge ours is the
only large analysis of fast food availability and consump-
tion that accounts for multiple environmental features and
individual characteristics simultaneously.
Yet, our study has some limitations. Our measure of
fast food consumption is based on self-report and, like all
self-report diet measures, has inherent recall and report-
ing error. Respondents were not instructed how to report
meals versus snacks; that is, snacking at a fast food res-
taurant may be undercounted if the respondent did not
consider it as a visit. Further, because the question asks

about the number of days that respondents ate fast food
in the last week, fast food consumption may be under-
represented if the respondent ate more than one fast
food meal in a day. Yet, this is a measure that is com-
monly used to assess fast food consumption in large
population-based studies such as the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics and Coronary Artery Risk Develop-
ment in Young Adults [39,42]. Moreover, we are unable
to ascertain what foods were available and consumed at
each fast food visit. This is increasingly an issue as fast
food restaurants are including healthier options in
response to consumer health concerns [43]. In addition,
our study is cross-sectional and thus does not capture
changes in the food environment or consumption over
time. We were also unable to control for factors related
to selection of residential neighborhoods, however by
including Wave I school indicator variables, we
attempted to address unmeasured characteristics asso-
ciated with baseline neighborhood. Our 3 km network
neighborhood buffer may not accurately reflect food-pur-
chasing areas for different urban settings and sociodemo-
graphic subgroups, however estimates for the 1 km
network buffer were very similar. Significant differences
in characteristics of respondents included versus
excluded in our sample may have biased our results.
There may be error in our roadway (StreetMap Pro)
and food resource data that we are unable to investigate
in our national sample. In addition, the relatively narrow
range of fast food availability may limit our ability to
detect effects of fast food availability in relation to fast
food consumption. We were not able apply spatial inter-
action models to our national sample, but our models
account for spatial clustering of respondents. The trade-
off is our large, national sample and the ability to com-
pare individuals living in non-urban, low density urban,
and high density urban environments, within the context
of the same cohort. There are no other datasets in which
such a study is possible at the small, geographic unit
used in our study.
Despite these limitations, our study is an essential step
in understanding the allocation and consumption of fast
food restaurants across geographic space over the entire
U.S. and within urbanicity levels, and our findings can
inform measurement and design in future individual-
level and longitudinal studies.
Implications
Our findings are significant in light of the recent efforts to
reduce obesity though policies targeting the fast food
environment. For example, a one-year ban on fast food
restaurants was unanimously put forth in South Los
Angeles (LA) in an effort to reduce obesity in this low SES
area, despite lower fast food restaurant per capita relative
to more affluent West LA [44]. Given evidence that eating
fast food increases BMI and obesity risk [39,45], reducing
fast food consumption may be a valuable aim. However,
specific environmental factors that influence fast food con-
sumption among young adults are not well understood.
Our findings suggest that greater residential neighborhood
fast food availability may not be an important driver of
fast food consumption. Greater understanding of how life-
style factors and neighborhood food resources interact to
influence fast food consumption is needed to inform effec-
tive policy.
Conclusions
Findings from our large, national sample of U.S. young
adults do not support the hypothesis that neighborhood
fast food availability increases the likelihood of fast food
consumption among young adults. To understand the
complex relationship between fast food availability and
individual dietary behaviors, future research should inves-
tigate the settings in which young men and women con-
sume fast food, other individual lifestyle and contextual
influences on dietary choices, and how these processes dif-
fer across urbanicity and sociodemographic contexts.
