Background--Selenium is an antioxidant micronutrient with potential interest for cardiovascular disease prevention. Few
studies have evaluated the association between selenium and hypertension, with inconsistent findings. We explored the
relationship of serum selenium concentrations with blood pressure and hypertension in a representative sample of the
US population.
Methods and Results--We undertook a cross-sectional analysis of 2638 adults 40 years old who participated in the 2003
to 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Serum selenium was measured by inductively coupled
plasma-dynamic reaction cell-mass spectrometry. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg or
current use of antihypertensive medication. Mean serum selenium was 137.1 g/L. The multivariable adjusted
differences (95% CIs) in blood pressure levels comparing the highest (150 g/L) to the lowest (122 g/L) quintile
of serum selenium were 4.3 (1.3 to 7.4), 1.6 (0.5 to 3.7), and 2.8 (0.8 to 4.7) mm Hg for systolic, diastolic, and pulse
pressure, respectively. The corresponding odds ratio for hypertension was 1.73 (1.18 to 2.53). In spline regression
models, blood pressure levels and the prevalence of hypertension increased with increasing selenium concentrations up
to 160 g/L.
Conclusions--High serum selenium concentrations were associated with higher prevalence of hypertension. These findings
call for a thorough evaluation of the risks and benefits associated with high selenium status in the United States. (Circ

Selenium is an essential element with antioxidant proper-
ties mediated through glutathione peroxidases and other
selenoenzymes. Because oxidative stress is involved in hy-
pertension development,1 it has been suggested that selenium
may be involved in blood pressure control and hypertension
prevention.2­4 The few studies that have evaluated the asso-
ciation between selenium and blood pressure have been
inconsistent, reporting inverse,3,5 null,6,7 or positive8 associ-
ations. These studies were relatively small and were con-
ducted in European countries with moderately low selenium
intake. As a consequence, the association of selenium with
blood pressure levels is still uncertain, particularly in sele-
nium replete populations such as the United States.
In the United States, selenium intake ranges from 60 to 220
g/d,4,9,10 well above the recommended dietary allowance of
55 g/d.11,12 High selenium intake in the United States is a
consequence of the high selenium content of US soil, partic-
ularly in the Northern Plains. Organ meats, seafoods, muscle
meats, and cereals and grains are the main sources of
selenium in the diet, although the widespread use of vitamin/
mineral supplements also contributes to US selenium in-
take.13 At these intake levels, additional selenium intake does
not increase glutathione peroxidase synthesis or activity, but
rather increases plasma selenium concentration by nonspe-
cific incorporation of selenomethionine into plasma proteins.9
Furthermore, selenium has a narrow safety range,13 and high
selenium concentrations in US studies have been associated
with increased lipid levels14 and diabetes.15,17 The objective
of this study was thus to assess the association of serum
selenium concentrations with blood pressure levels and with the
prevalence of hypertension in the 2003 to 2004 US National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Methods
NHANES is conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics
using a complex multistage sampling design to obtain a probability
sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized US population. We used
data from NHANES 2003 to 2004,18 as this was the most recent

release with selenium data available in adults. Serum selenium
measurements were restricted to participants aged 40 years
(n3,299). Among these, 2903 participants had serum selenium
measurements, and 2699 participants had also blood pressure mea-
surements available. We excluded 2 pregnant women and 59
participants with missing data on relevant covariates (ie, body mass
index, education, cotinine concentration, and tobacco consumption).
The final sample size was 2638.
Serum Selenium
Collection materials were screened for potential selenium contami-
nation. After blood collection, serum aliquots were frozen at 20°C
and shipped to the laboratory. Serum selenium was measured at the
Trace Elements Laboratory at the Wadsworth Center of the New
York State Department of Health using inductively coupled plasma-
dynamic reaction cell-mass spectrometry (ICP-DRC-MS). The lab-
oratory procedures and quality control methods for serum selenium
measurement have been described in detail elsewhere.19 The
between-assay coefficients of variation for quality control pooled
samples analyzed throughout the duration of the survey ranged from
2.5% to 2.9%.
Hypertension
Blood pressure readings were obtained by trained and certified
physicians following procedures developed by the American Heart
Association.20 Study participants rested sitting quietly for 5 minutes
before 3 consecutive blood pressure readings were obtained using a
mercury sphygmomanometer with an appropriate size cuff (5 sizes
available) placed on the bare right arm. If one reading failed, a fourth
attempt could be made. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were
registered at the appearance (phase I) and disappearance (phase V) of
Korotkoff sounds, respectively. Repeated measurements of systolic

and diastolic blood pressure were averaged discarding the first one.20
Pulse pressure was calculated as the difference between systolic and
diastolic blood pressure. Quality control and assurance procedures
included extensive initial training, quarterly recertification, proce-
dural checklists, and continuous review of data for systematic
errors.21 Hypertension was defined as having an average systolic
blood pressure 140 mm Hg, an average diastolic blood pressure
90 mm Hg, or current use of antihypertensive medications.
Other Variables
Information on sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, menopausal
status, smoking, and use of vitamin/mineral supplements was based
on self-report. Body mass index was calculated by dividing mea-
sured weight in kilograms by measured height in meters squared.
Nutrient intake data were obtained from two 24-hour dietary recall
interviews,22 the first conducted in-person and a second phone
follow-up interview 3 to 10 days later. Average intakes were used
when information was available from both interviews. Serum coti-
nine was measured by isotope-dilution high-performance liquid
chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem
mass spectrometry.23
Statistical Methods
Participants were divided in quintiles of serum selenium concentra-
tion based on the weighted population distribution. Adjusted means
for blood pressure differences and odds ratios for hypertension status
comparing each quintile of serum selenium to the lowest quintile
were calculated using multivariable linear and logistic regression,
respectively. We used 3 models with progressive degrees of adjustment.
Model 1 was adjusted for sex, age (continuous), race/ethnicity
(non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American, or
other), and education (high school or higher versus less than high
school). Model 2 was further adjusted for body mass index (contin-
uous), smoking (never, former, current), cotinine (continuous), and
menopausal status (yes, no). Model 3 was further adjusted for use of
vitamin/mineral supplements (yes, no) and, in linear regression
models, for use of antihypertensive medications (yes, no). Continu-
ous covariables were included as linear terms in the models. Because
adjusting for hypertension treatment may result in biased estimates
of the association between selenium and continuous blood pressure
outcomes, we conducted an additional analysis using censored linear
regression (Model 4) to correct for antihypertensive treatment using
NHANES survey weights.24 Tests for linear trend were calculated by
including serum selenium as a continuous variable in the models. To
further explore the shape of the relationship between serum selenium
and blood pressure measurements and hypertension, we used re-
stricted quadratic splines25 with knots at the 5th, 50th, and 95th
percentiles of the serum selenium distribution in models adjusted as
previously described for Model 3. We also evaluated the interactions
between selenium (modeled as quadratic restricted splines) and sex,
age, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, smoking status, or
use of vitamin/mineral supplements by fitting separate models for
every interaction, including all the adjustment variables described for
Model 3 but each with interaction terms for the selenium splines and
the variable of interest. Statistical analyses were performed using the
survey package26 (version 3.6.13) in R27 (version 2.6.1) to account
for the complex sampling design and weights in NHANES 2003 to
2004. Censored regression models were estimated using the cnreg
command in Stata28 (version 9.2) weighted for NHANES survey
weights.

Results
The mean (SD) serum selenium concentration in the study
population was 137.1 (19.3) g/L. The overall prevalence of
hypertension was 45.2%. Participants with hypertension were
more likely to be older, non-Hispanic black, and have a higher
body mass index, and less likely to have a high school education
and to be current smokers compared to participants without
hypertension (Table 1). Serum selenium concentrations were
positively associated with age and with the use of vitamin/mineral
supplements and inversely associated with current smoking
(Table 2). Men had higher mean serum selenium than women
(139.7 versus 134.7 g/L). Non-Hispanic blacks had lower
mean serum selenium compared to non-Hipanic whites and to
Mexican-Americans (130.7, 137.7, and 140.4 g/L, respectively).
Mean serum selenium concentrations were higher in par-
ticipants with hypertension compared to those without it
(138.3 versus 136.1 g/L, P0.02). In multivariable adjusted
models (Table 3), the average differences (95% CIs) compar-
ing the highest (150 g/L) to the lowest (122 g/L)
selenium quintiles were 4.3 (1.3 to 7.4), 1.6 (0.5 to 3.7), and
2.8 (0.8 to 4.7) mm Hg for systolic, diastolic, and pulse
pressure, respectively. After correcting for use of medication
for hypertension in censored regression models, these differ-
ences were 6.3 (3.4 to 9.2), 2.8 (1.1 to 4.6), and 4.6 (1.8 to
7.4) mm Hg for systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure, respec-
tively. In spline regression models, blood pressure levels
increased with increasing selenium concentrations up to 160
g/L (Figure 1).

The multivariable adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) for hyper-
tension comparing the highest to the lowest selenium quin-
tiles was 1.73 (1.18 to 2.53; Table 4). In spline regression
models, the prevalence of hypertension increased with in-
creasing selenium concentrations up to 160 g/L (Figure 2).
The adjusted odds ratio for hypertension comparing the 90th
(160 g/L) to the 10th (115 g/L) percentiles of the selenium
distribution was 1.77 (1.27 to 2.47), with consistent findings
across clinically relevant subgroups (Figure 3).
Sensitivity analyses showed similar results after excluding
participants with self-reported cancer or cardiovascular dis-
ease, and after excluding participants taking any antihyper-
tensive medications. Similarly, results from Model 3 did not
substantially change after additional adjustment for dietary
variables from the 24-hour dietary recalls (total caloric intake,
polyunsaturated to saturated fat intake ratio, sodium, calcium,
magnesium, fiber, -carotene, vitamin E, vitamin C, and
alcohol intake), after separate additional adjustment for serum
levels of -carotene, vitamin E, and vitamin C, or after
separate additional adjustment for the presence of diabetes
and the presence of hypercholesterolemia. Adjustment for the
NHANES pseudoprimary sampling units had negligible ef-
fects on the results (not shown).
Discussion
In this representative cross-sectional study of the US popu-
lation, high serum selenium concentrations were associated
with higher blood pressure levels and with higher prevalence
of hypertension. Compared to the lowest quintile, participants
in the highest selenium quintile had increased systolic,
diastolic, and pulse pressure by 4.3, 1.6, and 2.8 mm Hg,
respectively (6.3, 2.8, and 4.6 mm Hg after correcting for use
of medication for hypertension in censored regression mod-
els, respectively). These differences are epidemiologically
and clinically important,29,30 and they add to the concerns
raised by the observation of elevated lipid levels14 and
increased risk of diabetes15,17 with high selenium concentra-
tions in studies conducted in the United States, a country with
high selenium intake.
Few observational studies have evaluated the association
of selenium with blood pressure levels. A study in elderly
Finnish men6 from areas with very low mean serum selenium
found no relationship between selenium and blood pressure.
Conversely, the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor
Study,5 a Finnish cohort of middle-aged men, found an
inverse association between serum selenium and systolic
blood pressure. The Flemish Study on Environment Genes
and Health Outcomes (FLEMENGHO)3 also found an in-
verse cross-sectional association between blood selenium
concentrations and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in
men, but this association was largely attributable to markedly
higher blood pressure levels in the lowest selenium quintile
(78 g/L) with little variation across the remaining quin-
tiles. Baseline blood selenium concentrations were also in-
versely associated with the risk of hypertension after 5.2
years of follow-up in men. No association was observed

among women, either cross-sectionally or prospectively.3 A
cross-sectional analysis of the French Etude du Viellissement
Arte
´rial (EVA),8 reported that hypertensive men, but not
women, had higher selenium concentrations compared to
those without major chronic diseases or risk factors. Plasma
selenium concentrations were not correlated with systolic
blood pressure in either men or women.8 Finally, serum
selenium concentrations were not associated with blood
pressure levels in the Olivetti Heart Study.7 All these studies
were conducted in European countries and had mean sele-
nium concentrations below 100 g/L.
Compared with previous observational studies, our study
was conducted in the United States, a country with high mean
serum selenium concentrations (137 g/L). The increased
blood pressure levels and prevalence of hypertension at high
selenium levels in NHANES 2003 to 2004 is consistent with
previous studies reporting a positive association of selenium
concentration with adverse lipid profile and diabetes risk.14­17
Indeed, it is possible that high risk factor levels at high
selenium concentrations may explain the U-shaped relation-
ship between selenium concentration and cardiovascular end
points observed in several US studies.12,31,32 Given the high
selenium intake in the US population and the popularity of
selenium supplements, it is important to elucidate the mech-
anisms underlying the association of high selenium exposure
and cardiovascular risk factors in selenium-replete
populations.
Unfortunately, no data are available on the effect of
selenium supplementation on blood pressure end points in
randomized controlled trials using single selenium supple-
ments. In the HDL-Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (HATS)
trial, selenium (100 g/d) was administered along with
vitamin E (800 IU/d), vitamin C (1000 mg/d), and ß-carotene
(25 mg/d), with no effect on blood pressure levels.31 In China
(Linxian), antioxidant supplementation (selenium 50 g/d,
-carotene 15 mg/d, and vitamin E 60 mg/d) in a nutritionally
deficient population was linked only to increased isolated
diastolic hypertension, but other blood pressure end points
were not significantly different.34
The concerns with potential metabolic side effects of
elevated selenium levels add to the lack of efficacy of

Hypertension Odds Ratio (90th vs 10th percentile)
Figure 3. Adjusted odds ratios (95% CIs) for hypertension comparing the 90th (160 g/L) versus the 10th (115 g/L) percentiles of the
serum selenium distribution. Serum selenium was modeled as restricted quadratic splines with nodes at the 5th, 50th, and 95th per-
centiles. Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for sex, age (continuous), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Mexican-American, or other), education (high school or higher versus less than high school), body mass index (continu-
ous), smoking (never, former, current), cotinine (continuous), menopausal status (yes, no), and use of vitamin/mineral supplements (yes,
no). Separate models for every interaction were fitted, each one including interaction terms for the selenium splines and the variable of
interest. The size of the square indicates the number of participants in each stratum.

selenium supplements recently shown in the Selenium and
Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), a mega-trial
aimed to evaluate the efficacy of selenium in preventing
prostate cancer. SELECT was prematurely stopped by the
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee for lack of benefit on
the prostate cancer prevention and for safety concerns.35
The strengths of our study come from the rigorous sam-
pling design, the strict adherence to study protocols in
measurements and laboratory assays, and the representa-
tiveness of the NHANES sample. Several limitations, how-
ever, need to be considered in the interpretation of these
findings. The cross-sectional design limits our ability to
determine the direction and the causality of the observed
association. It is possible that pathophysiological changes of
hypertension modify serum selenium concentration or that
participants with hypertension change their health behaviors,
including selenium intake through diet and dietary supple-
ments. Although the observed association persisted among
participants who did not use multivitamin/mineral supple-
ments and after adjusting for several intake variables, our
findings must be confirmed in prospective studies with
incident cases of hypertension. Also, dietary information in
NHANES was based on 24-hour recalls, which may not be
sufficiently reliable to estimate the nutrient intakes of indi-
viduals resulting in potential residual confounding. Another
limitation is the use of a single measurement of serum
selenium, which may be subject to relatively high within
person variability and may bias our findings toward the null.36
In addition, because only total serum Se was measured in
NHANES, we do not have information of selenoprotein
levels or activity or about nonspecific incorporation of
selenium as selenomethionine in other plasma proteins. More
detailed analysis of different selenoproteins and related ac-
tivities will be needed to better understand the association of
selenium with hypertension.
Our findings apply to high-selenium intake countries such
as the United States, and may not be generalized to other
populations with marginal selenium intake. Furthermore,
there is not yet a clear mechanism that could explain the
effects of high selenium concentrations on cardiovascular risk
factors. Although substantial attention has been paid to
explain the mechanisms for a potential benefit of increasing
serum selenium in low-selenium intake populations, the
mechanistic explanation for the effects of selenium above the
levels required to maximize glutathione peroxidase activity
are unknown.
In summary, high serum selenium concentrations were
associated with higher prevalence of hypertension in a rep-
resentative sample of US adults. The differences between the
extreme quintiles, more than 4 mm Hg for systolic blood
pressure, may be associated with a substantial number of
cardiovascular events and with complications in blood pres-
sure control. Recently, high selenium concentrations have
been linked to increased prevalence of hyperlipidemia and
diabetes14 and to a U-shaped relationship with cardiovascular
events.31 From a clinical perspective, selenium supplements
cannot currently be recommended for cardiovascular protec-
tion. Furthermore, for individuals living in regions with high
selenium intake, selenium supplementation could potentially
increase risk of hypertension, diabetes, or hypercholesterol-
emia. Our findings call for a thorough evaluation of the risks
and benefits associated high selenium status in the United
States.
