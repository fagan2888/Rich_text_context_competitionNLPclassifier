Racial Patterns in Disabled Elderly Persons' Use of
Medical Services

Objective. This study examines the extent that older persons experience patterns of health service use that vary by race.
Methods. Using the 1989 NLTCS database, researchers estimate ten binomial logistic regressions of community
medical service use by disabled White and Black older persons. Chow tests and Oaxaca decomposition analysis inform
why racial differences continue to exist, although most elderly persons have Medicare.
Results. With similar medical conditions, Blacks are less likely to use services, particularly prescription medications
and physician services. Use of some medical services is more likely for elderly Black persons who live in rural areas,
small cities, and Western states, or who have more IADLs, joint and breathing problems, and broken parts. An Oaxaca
decomposition indicates that differences in personal characteristics (e.g., income and health) do not fully explain racial
differences in use of prescriptions and physician services.
Discussion. For reasons that are unrelated to financial assets, blacks remain vulnerable in their ability to access ser-
vices commonly used by older persons. To remedy racial disparities in medical utilization, public policy must expand its
focuses beyond health finance issues and consider differences in availability, accessibility, and acceptability.
OR elderly persons, maintaining health entails the use
of a multiplicity of service providers, greater than that
for younger adult groups (Ferris & Wyszewianski, 1990).
For example, screenings for vision, hearing, dementia, can-
cer, foot problems, and physical and occupational therapy
correspond with a greater incidence of diseases and chronic
disabilities. However, access to a diverse spectrum of health
and medical care services is not coordinated (Estes, Swan,
& Associates, 1993). This lack of coordination suggests that
some elderly persons may lack knowledge of available ser-
vices, face restrictions in the use of services, and/or not
meet eligibility criteria for use of services that are important
to fully meet their needs. A coordinating or referral mecha-
nism may not exist to ensure that an elderly person moves
from a no-care zone, or a care environment with service
gaps, to an agency or provider that supplies needed services
(Estes, Swan, & Associates, 1993). When older persons ex-
perience no-care zones, they are not able to function at max-
imum capacity (Wallace, 1990a).
Three organizational dimensions are useful in under-
standing why no-care zones and service gaps in care occur:
availability, accessibility, and acceptability (Wallace, 1990a).
Structural barriers that result from residential segregation,
limited income and health insurance, and geographical dis-
tribution of facilities can limit the availability of services. A
lack of knowledge about available services can limit acces-
sibility. Patient dissatisfaction and unfavorable doctor-patient
interactions can lead to perceptions that care is unacceptable.
Are elderly ethnic minorities more likely to experience
no-care zones and service gaps in community-based care
commonly used by older persons? We know that minority
elderly persons are more likely than White elderly persons
to face many of the structural barriers noted above, to lack
knowledge about new medical techniques, and to evaluate
medical services as culturally insensitive and/or racially dis-
criminatory (Wallace, 1990b; Whittle, Conigliaro, Good, &
Joswiak, 1997). However, no conclusive research ascertains
whether minority elderly persons are obtaining a mix of
long-term care services that meet their needs (Markides &
Wallace, 1996). Further, it is unclear whether they receive
other community services (including acute and preventive
care) that meet their needs.
In health care systems that lack incentives to deliver a co-
ordinated mix of community services to elderly persons,
physicians serve a central role as gatekeepers who identify
and certify eligibility for community services. However,
there is a historical tradition that enables physicians to se-
lect their patients (Rosenbaum, Serrano, Magor, & Stern,
1997). For example, physicians may select patients by re-
fusing to provide services to Medicaid patients or locating
their practices in communities where undesirable patients
do not reside. Thus, the concentration of minority elderly
persons in urban central cities and high probabilities of in-
surance coverage by Medicaid leads minority elderly per-
sons to face higher risks of a lack of access to physicians. If
patients lack access to physicians, they may also lack access
to the gatekeepers who assist them in developing variability
in the mix of community services obtained (Cohen, Bloom,
Simpson, & Parsons, 1997).
When Blacks receive medical care, they receive less care
and different care than that received by whites. Lee, Gehl-
bach, Hosmer, Reti, and Baker (1997) examined this phe-
nomenon while controlling for racial differences in location
and insurance status. They analyzed racial differences in
procedures used among a zip code and race matched sample
of Medicare beneficiaries. Lee and colleagues (1997) found
F
RACIAL PATTERNS IN MEDICAL CARE S77
that Whites received more services than Blacks and Black
Medicare beneficiaries were more likely to receive lower
cost procedures and services. These findings corroborate
those of Escarce, Epstein, Colby, and Schwartz (1993) who
report similar patterns of racial differences in medical pro-
cedures and diagnostic tests. Among those with Medicare
coverage, Black patients with glaucoma have received less
treatment than white Medicare beneficiaries (Javitt et al.,
1991). These racial differences in the quality of care re-
ceived may also influence utilization patterns.
While there is an abundant supply of home health agen-
cies, use of home health services is closely tied to whether
Medicare supplements, private insurance or financial resources
are available. Medicare provides only limited coverage for
these services. Further, some home health agencies, primar-
ily for-profit agencies, engage in patient selection by locat-
ing in high income areas, not using sliding fee scale pay-
ments, and providing only profitable services (Nutter, 1984;
Slessinger, Marmor, & Smithey, 1987; Swan & Estes, 1990).
These efforts, along with concerns about acceptability of
services due to racial prejudice (Wallace, 1990a), place
low-income and/or minority persons at risk of a gap in use
of home health services.
Access to prescription drugs is closely tied with use of
physicians. For both White and Black elderly persons, use
of prescription drugs is higher when number of physical
health visits in the past year increases and when it is more
likely that the same physician was seen on each visit (Fil-
lenbaum et al., 1993). Black elderly persons, particularly
Black men, take fewer prescription drugs; this lower utiliza-
tion is partly explained by differences in physician prescrip-
tions for Black compared to White elderly persons (Fillen-
baum et al., 1993).
In this paper I use data from the 1989 National Long
Term Care Survey to examine two primary research ques-
tions: (a) To what extent do disabled older persons experi-
ence patterns of health service use that vary according to
race, and (b) Will strategies of changing health care financ-
ing options alleviate concerns of whether adequate health
care access exists for all disabled older persons. To address
these questions, I (i) examine and contrast patterns of health
service use and health status for disabled Black and White
older persons; (ii) explore the extent that there are racial dif-
ferences in the use of particular services; (iii) identify the
factors that influence utilization of health providers who
commonly deliver services to older persons who have
chronic disabilities and live at home; and (iv) examine the
role of racial differences in health conditions and financial
resources as factors influencing racial patterns of commu-
nity service use.
Background
Lumsdon (1994) suggests that service gaps in long-term
care are not a new concern. Always present has been a pa-
tient-driven system where patients have sought out and
pieced together a fragmented and uncoordinated system of
care that includes service duplication and initial treatment at
advanced stages of disease. It is this use of a disconnected
spectrum of community services by White and Black eld-
erly persons that this paper explores.
Whether race is a factor in older disabled persons' use of
community-based long term care is equivocal. Wolinsky
and colleagues (1989) document inequities for minority eld-
erly persons. They pool data from the 1976 through 1984
Health Interview Surveys to estimate models of physician
contacts and visits, hospital contacts and visits, stratified ac-
cording to ethnic groups. Wolinsky and associates (1989)
compare stratified regressions for five ethnic groups, Puerto
Rican, Cuban, Mexican, Black, and Anglo elderly persons.
The model's independent variables include predisposing
characteristics (gender, marital status, employment status,
live alone, age), enabling characteristics (telephone, city
residence, supply of medical personnel), and need charac-
teristics (activity limitations, perceived health). They find
that health needs are the primary determinants of health ser-
vices utilization. Yet, the importance of health needs in pre-
dicting service use varies according to ethnic group. Thus,
the researchers conclude that inequities exist in access to the
health care system's physicians and hospitals.
Mui and Burnette (1994) use data from the 1982-84 Na-
tional Long Term Care Survey to examine long term care
service use by African American, Hispanic, and White older
disabled persons. They find that race/ethnicity is a significant
factor affecting utilization patterns. They examine use of in-
home (home health, meals-on-wheels), community social
services, and nursing home care. Their models include mea-
sures of predisposing characteristics (sex, age), enabling
characteristics (income, live alone, nursing home attitudes,
use of the three alternative services), need factors (cognitive
and ADL impairments, number of illnesses, unmet needs),
and dummy variables for race/ethnicity. In these models,
Mui and Burnette (1994) find that African American older
persons are 18% less likely to use in-home care services and
82% less likely to use nursing homes than non-Hispanic
White older persons. No statistically significant racial dif-
ferences were found in the use of community social services.
Kemper (1992) uses data from the 1982­84 National
Long-Term Care Channeling Evaluation to document the
factors that influence the use of paid and volunteer home
health services, and also informal support services. Included
in the regression model are dummy variables for race/eth-
nicity and variables measuring formal care availability, need
(ADL disabilities, incontinence, cognitive/behavior prob-
lems), and other demographic characteristics. Kemper's re-
sults indicate a statistically significant role of race/ethnicity,
with African Americans and Hispanics less likely to use
home health services and more likely to use family informal
support services.
Wallace, Levy-Storms, Kingston, and Andersen (1998)
use data from the nursing home and community-based sam-
ples of the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey to
examine racial patterns of long term care utilization. Their
models predict nursing home use, paid home care use (with
no nursing home use), and unpaid home care use only (with
no nursing home or paid home care use), using measures of
predisposing, enabling, and need variables. African Ameri-
cans are less likely than non-Latino Whites to use nursing
homes and paid home care services.
In contrast, Wolinsky and Johnson (1991) examine older
persons' use of formal and informal health services, includ-
S78 WHITE-MEANS
ing nine measures of utilization. The three informal mea-
sures are: bed disability days taken, number of bed disabil-
ity days, and number of home health services utilized. The
formal services are physician contact, physician visits, hos-
pital contacts, and hospital visits. Two additional measures
of formal service used are whether the respondent entered
the nursing home or died in the last two years of the Longi-
tudinal Study on Aging (LSOA). The independent variables
are measures of predisposing characteristics (including
measures of multigenerational families, kin and nonkin sup-
ports, health worries, health control), and enabling and need
characteristics. In addition, six interaction terms of race
with health needs are included. Race (Black) was entered in
each regression and found insignificant. However, several
race interaction terms are significant: Among those with
ADLs limiting household activities and upper body limita-
tions, Blacks are more likely to use home health services.
Blacks with advanced ADLs are less likely to have a physi-
cian contact than Whites with the same limitation. Blacks
who need help with basic ADLs have more physician visits
than Whites. Hospital contact is more likely for Blacks with
ADLs that limit household activities and less likely for
Blacks with lower body and upper body limitations.
Miller and colleagues (1996), use data from three na-
tional sources (Supplement on Aging [1984], National Long
Term Care Survey [1984], and National Medical Expendi-
ture Survey [1987]) to examine the coefficient on a race
dummy variable in logistic regression models of use of
home-based services, senior centers, and all community ser-
vices. For comparability among data sets, only those per-
sons who are age 70 or older were studied. The independent
variables are measures of predisposing characteristics (fam-
ily composition and household structure), enabling condi-
tions (income and insurance), and need (health and func-
tional limitations). In all cases, Miller and colleagues (1996)
find the coefficients reflecting the log-odds of race statisti-
cally insignificant. The authors state that previously docu-
mented racial disparities were possibly due to income dis-
parities. Because ethnic minority populations are more
likely to have Medicaid coverage and the log-odds ratio for
Medicaid was significant, researchers note that they have
captured race effects in this variable. Thus, they conclude
that because Medicaid enhances access to care, it leads to
equality in access. Aday, Fleming, and Anderson (1984)
have presented similar documentation of equitable access to
health care.
One consistent finding in the literature is that Blacks are
less likely to use nursing home services. This conclusion is
reached in models that include dummy variable measures of
race. Another consistent finding is that race dummy vari-
ables are statistically insignificant in models of social and
community services. The research that identifies race pat-
terns in the use of physician and hospital services either
identifies these differences based on the magnitude of the
coefficients in models that are stratified by race/ethnicity or
based on the use of race interaction terms. There are con-
trasting findings regarding race in models of paid in-home
care, even in studies that use the same data sources. Race
dummy variables are found statistically significant in some
studies (i.e., Kemper [1992], Mui & Burnette [1994], and
Wallace, Levy-Storms, Kingston, & Andersen [1998]) and
insignificant in others (i.e., Miller et al. [1996] and Wolin-
sky & Johnson [1991]). However, Wolinsky and Johnson
(1991) find significant race interaction effects in paid in-
home care models.
Differences in the reported effects of race among re-
searchers who use the same data is an unexpected finding.
However, differences in methodological strategies may
partly explain these equivocal results. For example, using
the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey, Miller and
colleagues (1996) find a dummy variable measure of race
insignificant and Wallace and colleagues (1998) find it sig-
nificant. One important distinction between the two studies
is the age of persons in the study samples. Miller and associ-
ates (1996) include persons age 70 and older and Wallace
and colleagues (1998) include persons age 65 and older.
This sampling difference has significant implications for the
study of race. Due to the relatively higher mortality rates of
Blacks, particularly Black men, the gender composition of
the sample of Black older persons who are age 70 and older
is quite different from one that includes persons age 65 and
older.
A second methodological strategy that may explain dif-
ferences in the reported findings is the inclusion of different
samples. Miller and colleagues (1996) use a community
sample of disabled older persons whereas Wallace and asso-
ciates (1998) use a sample of institutionalized and noninsti-
tutionalized older persons. Because Blacks are less likely to
be institutionalized, this sampling difference may possibly
explain why Wallace and colleagues (1998) found race sig-
nificant and Miller and coworkers (1996) did not.
Previous research, particularly Wolinsky and Johnson
(1991), informs that use of a dummy variable that indicates
race may not fully explain the relationship between race and
service utilization. It is possible that a race dummy variable
can be insignificant while a race interaction term may be
significant. Whereas research that includes race interaction
terms informs how race influences the use of particular ser-
vices, it is unclear whether these utilization patterns are as-
sociated with experiences of no-care zones or service gaps
in care and a corresponding inability of elderly persons to
function at maximum capacity.
One major limitation for all researchers who want to un-
derstand the role of race in affecting health services use is
lack of data that explicitly measure culture and experiences
of discrimination. These are excluded variables that reflect
racial phenomenon and are correlated with included mea-
sures. Their exclusion potentially biases the reported coeffi-
cients of included variables.
This paper extends the existing literature by examining
the factors that influence use of specific community based
services. I reexamine patterns in the utilization of commu-
nity long-term care services, using both bivariate and multi-
variate analysis strategies. The database for this research is
the 1989 National Long Term Care Survey, a database de-
signed to understand the health and formal and informal ser-
vice use of disabled elderly persons. I present descriptive
statistics on the types of community medical services used
by disabled elderly persons, providing racial comparisons. I
contrast these medical utilization patterns with racial com-
RACIAL PATTERNS IN MEDICAL CARE S79
parisons of levels of health and find that Black elderly per-
sons are more likely to report medical conditions and less
likely to report medical utilization.
Logistic regressions are presented in models that include
race dummy variables and models that are stratified accord-
ing to race. Chow tests and an Oaxaca decomposition pro-
vide further insight into the reasons that there are racial dif-
ferences. The Chow test examines the role of race interaction
variables. The Oaxaca decomposition examines the poten-
tial role of culture and discrimination, using a data set that
does not include explicit measures of either variable. The
paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of
these findings for future research and public policy.
METHODS
Data
The data source for this analysis is the National Long
Term Care Survey (NLTCS), 1989. It is the third wave of a
nationally representative data base that identifies survey
participants from Medicare rolls and is designed to describe
chronically disabled elderly persons. The data are sponsored
by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and
Evaluation (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services),
the Health Care Financing Administration, and the Bureau
of Census (U.S. Department of Commerce). In 1989, the
NLTCS questioned 5,817 older persons who were (a) inter-
viewed in the 1982 and/or 1984 rounds of the survey; (b)
identified in previous survey periods and were not inter-
viewed because they did not meet the age and disability cri-
teria at that time, but met them in 1989; or (c) newly identi-
fied in 1989 and met the survey's age and disability criteria
in 1989. Respondents met the disability criteria if they had
ADL or IADL impairments that were chronic, that is, last-
ing or expected to last 90 days or longer. Respondents were
persons aged 65 and older.
I use a subsample of this data set for this paper's analysis.
I include Black and White elderly persons who were living
in the community (not institutionalized) during the survey
period. This includes a total of 527 Black and 4,007 White
disabled elderly persons. Survey respondents provided de-
tailed information on their medical conditions and physical
limitations, health insurance, financial status, medical utili-
zation, and informal in-home assistance received from fam-
ily and friends.
Regression analysis strategy.--To examine the relative
influence of health conditions and financial resources on ra-
cial patterns of community long-term care services, I esti-
mate several regression models. First, I estimate ten models
of community services utilization by elderly persons. Next,
each service utilization model is reestimated and includes
the independent variables of the previous models and a
complete set of interaction terms of race with each indepen-
dent variable of the model. Finally, each race interaction
term is entered in each of the ten regression models sequen-
tially, to examine its independent influence on the regres-
sions.
Each regression model includes at least 26 independent
variables. The regression models that include these vari-
ables and also a complete set of interaction terms have a to-
tal of 51 independent variables. The sheer size of this set of
independent variables potentially raises a concern about
possible overfitting of the models. The standard rule of
thumb in event history analysis is that there must be at least
ten events (the lesser number of persons with or without the
condition/service use) per independent variable. If the rule
of thumb is met, (a) regression coefficients are less likely to
be biased in both positive and negative directions; (b) sam-
ple variances are less likely to be biased in both positive and
negative directions; and (c) the probability of significance in
the wrong direction is reduced (Peduzzi, Concato, Kemper,
Holford, & Feinstein, 1996). At least 260 events are needed
for each of the ten basic models of service utilization with
26 independent variables. The ten regression models that
also include a 27th variable, that is, an interaction term with
race and one of the 26 independent variables, require 270
events. The full interaction models (with 51 independent
variables) require 510 events. Tables 3 and 4 report the
number of events for each of the regression models. Most of
the basic 26 term additive models and models with the sin-
gle interaction (27th) term meet the rule of ten. The excep-
tions are emergency room, dental, foot doctor, optometrist,
and therapist visits, and also the stratified regression of phy-
sician visits for Black elderly persons. These equations are
also the ones that do not meet the rule of ten for the full in-
teraction models.
The NLTCS (1989) includes fourteen noninstitutional-
ized, formal community services that disabled elderly persons
typically use: paid in-home caregiver, physical therapist,
occupational therapist, speech therapist, hearing therapist,
mental health professional, dentist, foot doctor, optometrist,
chiropractor, emergency room, home visit by a physician,
visit to a physician's office, and prescription medicine. Due
to inadequate variability in the measures of use of mental
health professionals, chiropractors, and home visits by phy-
sicians, I do not estimate regressions of these types of ser-
vice use. To measure use of therapist services, I develop a
measure that equals one if any type of therapist services is
received.
Our ten regression models include eight models that ex-
amine use of specific community services: (a) whether there
is at least one compensated family or community caregiver;
(b) whether there is use of at least one therapist; (c) whether
there is at least one visit to a dentist; (d) whether there is at
least one visit to a foot doctor; (e) whether there is at least
one visit to an optometrist; (f) whether there is at least one
visit to an emergency room; (g) whether there is a visit to a
physician's office; and (h) whether prescription medications
are bought or obtained. The other two regression models are
(i) whether there was a need to see a physician and no visit
was made and (ii) whether the elderly person had a usual
source of care. All ten regression models are estimated us-
ing a binomial logistic regression procedure.
The regression models include measures of medical con-
ditions and disabilities, a measure of household income,
health insurance status, regional and rural residence, whether
unpaid caregivers provide in-home services, and sociodemo-
graphic measures. I describe these variables in more detail
in Table 1, with means reported by race.

RESULTS
Health and Medical Care
Table 1 reports the means for various community ser-
vices used by disabled elderly persons, according to race.
The data for the subsample used in this analysis are
weighted to produce national cross-sectional estimates of
medical use according to race. The patterns of service utili-
zation of Blacks and Whites are similar, with several key
exceptions. Disabled White elderly persons are more likely
to receive therapist services (particularly those of a physical
therapist), as well as dental and chiropractor services. Dis-
abled Black elderly persons are more likely to lack a usual
source of care. Disabled White elderly persons obtain more
prescriptions and have a greater chance of receiving ser-
vices in the emergency room than disabled Black elderly
persons. In this 1989 data base, bivariate analysis indicates
that statistically significant differences exist in the commu-
nity care of disabled Black and White elderly persons, with
Blacks less likely to receive the care.
Medical care services are not consumer goods purchased
for the direct satisfaction that they yield. Rather, disabled older
persons have consumed them to generate/monitor changes
in health conditions, leading to improvements or stabiliza-
tion of their health status. Are disabled Black elderly per-
sons receiving fewer services because they are less in need
of care? Table 1 also reports respondents' medical condi-
tions, according to race. Consistent with reports in previous
research, the sample of disabled Black elderly persons report
more incidences of medical conditions and disabilities than
Whites. Disabled Black elderly persons are significantly more
likely to report problems with joints, glaucoma, diabetes, high
blood pressure, and cognitive disorders. Disabled White eld-
erly persons are significantly more likely to report neurolog-
ical problems, cancer, and broken bones. We found no sta-
tistically significant differences in reports of heart problems,
stroke, or breathing disorders. Disabled Blacks are more
likely to have difficulty eating, getting in and out of bed,
and getting dressed. A report of three or more limitations in
instrumental activities of daily living is more likely for Black
elderly persons than White elderly persons.
These data suggest that disabled Black elderly persons
should have greater medical utilization than disabled White
elderly persons. However, the reported health conditions in
Table 1 are associated with lower medical services utiliza-
tion among disabled Black elderly persons.
Table 2 presents the data in Table 1 in a different way. It
reports service use according to medical condition and race.
This strategy seeks to control for the influence of reported
medical conditions and investigate whether chronically dis-
abled Black and White elderly persons with similar health
status have similar monthly use of medical services. For
most medical conditions and limitations in activities of
daily living, Black elderly persons use significantly fewer
prescription drugs than White elderly persons. Table 2 re-
ports a consistent pattern of statistically significant racial
differences in therapist services. With one exception (for
stroke patients), disabled Black elderly persons are less
likely to use therapist services than White elderly persons.

White elderly persons is a surprising yet consistent pattern.
This finding contrasts with research on those aged 65 and
younger, where reports suggest that Blacks are significantly
more likely to use the emergency room (Thornton & White-
Means, 1996; White-Means & Thornton, 1995). In only
three instances are there significant racial differences in the
use of paid caregivers--glaucoma, cognitive disorders, and
toileting ADLs. In those instances White elderly persons are
more likely than Black elderly persons to have a paid care-
giver. Similarly, statistically significant racial differences
occur in reports of a need to see a doctor yet not seeing one
among disabled elderly persons with nerve and heart condi-
tions and those with bathing limitations. Only for the later
two health states are disabled Black elderly persons more
likely not to seek care when they need it.
Examining particular diseases and racial patterns of ex-
pected service utilization is also informative. Among glaucoma
patients, one would expect significant use of optometrists'
services. White elderly glaucoma patients are significantly
more likely to visit optometrists than Black elderly glau-
coma patients. Diabetes requires frequent monitoring by
physicians and podiatrists; yet, Black elderly patients are
less likely to visit podiatrists. Hypertension is commonly
treated with prescription medications; White elderly patients
with this diagnosis have greater use of prescription medi-
cine than their Black counterparts. Recovery from strokes is
facilitated by the use of therapists' services; however, White
elderly stroke patients are less likely to have therapist visits
and more likely to visit the emergency room than Black eld-
erly patients. This racial pattern is possibly related to racial
differences in survival from strokes, with White elderly stroke
patients being more likely to report an "old" stroke. When
elderly patients have cognitive conditions and ADLs, the
services of a paid caregiver provide essential support. White
elderly patients are more likely than Black elderly patients
to have a paid caregiver when they have been diagnosed
with a cognitive condition or have difficulty with toileting.
Racial patterns in use of medical services are prevalent
among disabled elderly persons with the same medical con-
ditions and disabilities. When statistically significant differ-
ences in utilization occur, in most instances, they are associ-
ated with Black elderly persons having lower use of medical
services. What explains these patterns of medical utilization
among chronically disabled older persons? Are they prima-
rily due to differences in financial resources? For this sur-
vey sample, the mean household income for disabled White
elderly persons is about $15,211; the mean for disabled
Black elderly persons is about $9,196. While Medicare in-
sures most respondents (97% for Whites and 94% for
Blacks), significant differences exist in the other types of in-
surance coverage acquired by disabled elderly persons.
Medicaid insures almost half (41%) of noninstitutionalized
disabled Black elderly persons and about 13% of disabled
White elderly persons. More than 70% of disabled White eld-
erly persons have private insurance supplements and only
31% of disabled Black elderly persons report such coverage.
Utilization of Community Services
In Table 3 I report the results for the ten regression models,
each including a race dummy variable. The race dummy
variable is statistically significant in only one model: pre-
scription medication use. Black elderly persons were signifi-
cantly (at the .0001 level) less likely to obtain prescriptions.
The regression analysis includes a sample that is smaller
than the total sample of Black and White older persons in
the data base. This is primarily due to a typical pattern in
survey research, where there are missing data on family in-
come (with 1,096 missing) and education (with 338 miss-
ing). The typical pattern is for persons at the upper and
lower ends of the income distribution to be less likely to re-
port their incomes and education or both. Thus, there are
nonrandom and systematic patterns of data loss that we ad-
dress by list-wise deletion of all observations for which data
are missing. Although the list-wise deletion procedure re-
sults in a loss of statistical power, it has been found to lead
to accurate parameter estimates in cases where no more than
30% of the data are missing (Kromrey & Hines, 1994; Swit-
zer, Roth, & Switzer, 1998). The regressions presented in
this paper meet this criteria.
Health conditions were the primary determinants of use
of community services in each of the ten regression models
reported in Table 3. The only health condition that was in-
significant in each of the ten regression models was stroke.
The variable, cognitive problems, was significant in only
one regression model, where respondents needed to see a
physician but did not. The presence of cognitive problems
increased the likelihood that a physician was not seen.
Those who were more likely to have a usual source of care
were elderly persons with high ADLs, and heart and hyper-
tension problems. Use of the emergency room was more
likely when elderly persons had diabetes, heart problems,
broken parts, or breathing problems. Physician visits were
more likely for those with joint, heart, and breathing prob-
lems and for those with diabetes, hypertension, and broken
parts. In addition to those with cognitive problems, those
with joint, heart, and breathing problems had higher proba-
bilities of not seeing a physician although one was needed.
The only health conditions that did not influence use of
prescriptions were cognitive problems, stroke, and broken
parts. Only one statistically significant health condition, the
interaction term of high ADLs with number of IADLs, was
negatively related with the probability of prescription medi-
cation use.
Having a paid caregiver was more likely for elderly per-
sons with high ADLs or IADLs, yet somewhat less likely
for those with both high ADLs and IADLs. The only health
condition that significantly affected the probability of use of
a dentist was the number of IADLs; with more IADLs there
was a lower probability of a dental visit. Those with joint
problems and diabetes were more likely to visit a foot doc-
tor. Hypertension and the joint presence of high ADLs and
IADLs decreased the likelihood of a visit to an optometrist,
while glaucoma, joint problems, and diabetes increased the
likelihood of a visit. Therapist visits were more likely
among those with high ADLs and broken parts.
It is also interesting to note the role of the enabling fac-
tors income and insurance as factors affecting the likelihood
of using community services. Income was positively associ-
ated with the likelihood of a usual source of care and physi-
cian, dental, and foot doctor visits. Higher income de-

creased the probability of not seeing a physician when one
was needed and having a paid caregiver. Insurance coverage
by Medicaid increased the likelihood of having a paid care-
giver, yet decreased the likelihood of having a usual source
of care and not seeing a physician when one needs to visit.
Those who were insured by Medicare only were less likely
to have a usual source of care, use prescription medications,
and visit a dentist.
Somewhat surprising is the finding that the variables un-
paid ADL and IADL caregivers were only statistically sig-
nificant in the paid caregiver regression model. The results
suggest that both unpaid ADL caregivers and unpaid IADL
caregivers are substitutes for paid caregivers and thus de-
crease the likelihood of having a paid caregiver. Although
rural residents are less likely to visit the dentist or foot doctor,
they are more likely to see a physician when one is needed.
Based on the findings of the above models, it is tempting
to conclude that race does not influence the use of commu-
nity medical services, with the exception of prescription
medication use. To further explore the role of race in influ-
encing community medical services utilization, we perform
a Chow test and also explore the interactive effect of race.
The Chow test (a chi-square test of differences in intercepts
and slopes) assesses whether every independent variable in
the regression model affects Black and White elderly per-
sons differently (Chow, 1960). That is, it tests for the stabil-
ity of the regression coefficients and whether they are not
the same for Black and White older persons. The Chow test
is a very stringent test of the role of race because race must
be found to interact significantly with every independent
variable in the model in order to accept the hypothesis of the
test. The full interaction model (on which the Chow test is
based) and models that test for the interactive effect of race
with respect to a subset of the independent variables, as-
sume that models which include race dummy variables only
may produce biased estimates for all coefficients. This is
because they exclude significant variables (race interaction
terms) that are correlated with the variables that are in-
cluded in the model. Furthermore, when the correct specifi-
cation of the regression model is one that includes interaction
terms, the estimated variance of the regression coefficients
in the models with only race dummy variables will be lower
than those in the models with interaction terms.
The Chow test uses the entire sample of Black elderly
persons and a reduced (random) sample of White elderly
persons. This sample size adjustment is required due to the
discrepancy in sample sizes for Blacks and Whites; the sam-
ple of White elderly persons is approximately seven times
that of Blacks. To perform the test of differences without
adjusting for sample size differences would muddle the in-
formation provided by the test. A chi-square test, performed
on two samples of equivalent size, neutralizes the system-
atic bias that is involved in the study design. Otherwise,
when regression analyses are performed on the combined
samples of Whites and Blacks, the results for the combined
sample will mirror those of the subsample population that is
disproportionately larger, that is, the White sample (White-
Means, 1995). The chi-square test assesses differences in
use of services by a representative 33% sample of White
elderly persons (n  800) and the sample of Black elderly
persons. The test statistic is the difference in 2*log-likeli-
hood ratio for the regression that pools the Black and re-
duced White sample (assuming the two racial groups are the
same) and the same statistic for a regression that assumes
the intercepts and slopes for the two groups are different.
In the chi-square test of differences for our regression
models, there is not a statistically significant difference in
community service utilization by Blacks and Whites. The
critical value of the test statistic for our model was 124.34. I
obtained values of 25.56, 37.86, 27.4, 31.94, 23.9, 52.68,
25.17, 58.19, 31.58, and 32.78 for the models of: (a)
whether there is at least one compensated family or commu-
nity caregiver; (b) whether there is a visit to a physician's
office; (c) whether there was a need to see a physician and
no visit was made; (d) whether there is at least one visit to a
dentist; (e) whether there is at least one visit to a foot doc-
tor; (f) whether there is at least one visit to an optometrist;
(g) whether there is use of at least one therapist; (h) whether
the elderly person had a usual source of care; (i) whether
there is at least one visit to an emergency room; and (j)
whether prescription medications are bought or obtained,
respectively. Thus, we were unable to support the hypothe-
sis that every factor examined in the regression model af-
fected service utilization by Black and White elderly per-
sons differently.
Although the chi-square tests of differences did not indi-
cate significant interactive effects of race for all variables in
the model, some individual variables had significant race in-
teraction terms. Table 3 reports the results of the regression
analyses when race interaction terms are entered for every
independent variable of the model. A superscript (c) indi-
cates that in such a model, the interaction term was positive
and significant. Thus, being Black increases the probability
of utilizing that particular service. A superscript (d) indi-
cates that the interaction term was negative and significant,
with Blacks having a lower probability of service utiliza-
tion. Table 3 also reports the results of regression analyses
when each interaction term is entered separately and all oth-
ers are excluded. These results are provided for the reader's
information, to compare with results found in the full inter-
action model. A superscript (a) indicates that in such a
model, the interaction term was positive and significant. A
superscript (b) indicates that in such a model, the interaction
term was negative and significant.
The interactive models provide new and valuable infor-
mation about the role of race in affecting service utilization.
First, some interaction terms are significant when entered
individually and remain significant when all other interac-
tion terms are added to the regression models. Other interac-
tion terms are not significant when entered individually, yet
are significant when all other interaction terms are added. A
third case is the interaction term that is significant when en-
tered individually and insignificant when all other interac-
tion terms are added. In the third case it is difficult to argue
that the identified relationship is not spurious and simply re-
flecting a biased coefficient and standard error estimate
(due to its correlation with another interaction term that
should be included in the model). Thus, the discussion of re-
sults will primarily delineate the first two cases of signifi-
cant interactive effects, that is, those with superscripts c or d.
RACIAL PATTERNS IN MEDICAL CARE S85
In the usual source of care model, seven race interac-
tion terms have significant effects. These are IADL, High
ADLIADL, rural, income, female, married, and educa-
tion. Black older persons who have more IADLs, live in ru-
ral areas, have higher incomes and who are female are more
likely than their White counterparts to have a usual source
of care. The joint presence of high ADLs and IADLs, more
years of formal education, and having a spouse lead Black
older persons to have lower probabilities of having a usual
source of care than their White counterparts. Black elderly
persons who have heart conditions are less likely to have an
emergency room visit than their White counterparts; those
who live in small cities in the North are more likely to have
an emergency room visit than their White counterparts.
Black elderly women with more IADLs, joint problems, and
hypertension are more likely to have physician visits. How-
ever, Black elderly persons with glaucoma, who live in the
Midwest, and have the joint presence of high ADLs and
IADLs are less likely to have physician visits. Living in a
rural area and having an unpaid IADL caregiver leads Black
elderly persons to have a higher probability of seeing a phy-
sician when needed compared with their White counter-
parts.
In contrast to White elderly persons, Black elderly per-
sons with breathing problems are less likely to have pre-
scription medications; those who live in rural areas and
small cities in the West are more likely to have prescription
medications. Black elderly persons who have joint problems
are more likely to have a paid caregiver and those with an
unpaid IADL caregiver are less likely to have a paid care-
giver, compared with their White counterparts. Black
women who live in the Midwest are less likely to have den-
tal visits. However, Blacks with broken parts or breathing
problems are more likely to visit foot doctors. IADLs, bro-
ken parts, breathing problems, and living in small cities in
the West increase the likelihood that Black elderly persons
visit the optometrist. Yet, Blacks who have glaucoma are
less likely than their White counterparts to visit the optome-
trist. Finally, the interactive models indicate that Black eld-
erly women are less likely than White elderly women to see
a therapist.
Another observation is important to note, although not re-
ported in Table 3: When the regression models for physi-
cian and optometrist visits include all interaction terms, the
race dummy variable is significant and negative, with Black
elderly persons less likely to have visits than their White
counterparts.
To what extent are racial differences in utilization of
medical services due to differences in average characteris-
tics of Black and White elderly persons? To explore this
question, I use a standard technique of labor economists and
demographers, the Oaxaca decomposition. This technique
typically is used to assess discrimination in labor market
earnings (Oaxaca, 1973). I applied this technique to gain
greater understanding of the factors underlying racial pat-
terns in medical use among elderly persons. The technique
assumes that we can explain racial differences in the proba-
bility of medical utilization as outcomes that occur due to
racial differences in the average characteristics of Blacks
and Whites (e.g., differences in income and insurance), and
due to factors excluded from the regression model. In labor
economic and demographic research, a key unmeasured ex-
cluded variable is discrimination. Thus, labor economists
and demographers usually attribute variation in labor mar-
ket outcomes that is not explained by differences in average
characteristics of Blacks and Whites to discrimination. In
medical markets, the experience of discrimination is one of
several key factors that researchers exclude in regression
models of medical utilization.
Based on an Oaxaca decomposition technique, we find
the answer to the question of whether racial differences in
utilization of medical services are due to differences in av-
erage characteristics of Black and White elderly persons by
calculating three probabilities: (a) the probability that White
elderly persons will use a service, (b) the probability that
Black elderly persons will use a service, and (c) the proba-
bility that White elderly persons will use a service (given a
level of health and demographic characteristics that repre-
sent those of the average Black elderly person). The differ-
ence in the first and third probabilities informs about the
portion of the racial difference in medical use that is due to
racial differences in characteristics. The difference in the
second and third probabilities is the unexplained portion of
the racial difference in medical service use. The unex-
plained racial difference may be due to unmeasured dimen-
sions of availability, accessibility, and acceptability, such as
discrimination, cultural preferences for different types of
care, skepticism about scientific medicine, and differences
in physical proximity and transportation services.
Stratified logistic regression models were performed for
(1) the use of prescription medicines and (2) physician vis-
its. These regressions were used in the Oaxaca decomposi-
tion analysis because in the previous regression analysis for
prescription medicines and physician visits, the race dummy
variable was found negative and significant, suggesting that
belonging to the racial group, Black, has an independent in-
fluence on the use of community medical services. The re-
gressions are reported in Table 4. Based on these regres-
sions, the predicted probability that an elderly person has at
least one prescription is 83.1% for White elderly and 80.2%
for Black elderly persons. We first compare the probability
that White elderly persons will use prescriptions (given
their own demographic characteristics) with the probability
that White elderly persons will use prescriptions (given the
demographic characteristics of Black elderly persons). The
probabilities are 83.1% and 86.4%, respectively, with a dif-
ference in the probabilities of 3.3%. This result indicates
that differences in the characteristics of Black and White
elderly persons should lead Whites to have a probability of
use of prescription medicine that is 3.3% lower than that of
Blacks. The difference in the probability that White elderly
persons will use prescriptions (given the demographic char-
acteristics of Black elderly persons) and the probability that
Black elderly persons will use prescriptions (given their
own demographic characteristics) is 6.2%. This result re-
flects the unexplained difference in use of prescriptions that
is accounted for by racial differences in availability, acces-
sibility, and acceptability. Thus, White elderly persons who
have demographic characteristics that characterize the typi-
cal Black elderly person should experience a probability of
S86 WHITE-MEANS
prescription use that is 6.2% higher than Black elderly per-
sons who have the same characteristics.
The Oaxaca decomposition also was performed using the
logistic regression model of visits to a doctor. Similar to the
results for the prescription medication model, the difference
in the predicted probability of visits to the physician was
3.1%, with White elderly persons having a higher probabil-
ity of physician use. From the Oaxaca decomposition we
find that racial differences in characteristics of White and
Black elderly persons should lead Whites to have a .05%
lower probability of visits to a physician. Unexplained ra-
cial differences in use of physicians lead the probability of
physician use to be 3.12% higher for White elderly persons,
compared with Black elderly persons. Thus, almost 100%
of the racial difference in use of physician services is due to
racial differences in availability, accessibility, and accept-
ability.
DISCUSSION
Black elderly persons remain vulnerable in their ability to
obtain health care services commonly used by disabled
older persons. Several key findings from this research sup-
port this conclusion. First, we know that with similar medi-
cal conditions, Black older persons are less likely to use ser-
vices. Second, relying solely on the finding of a statistically
significant race dummy variable as an indicator of racial
differences in utilization of community services by disabled
elderly persons, I conclude that Blacks are less likely to
have prescription medicines, visit physicians, or visit op-
tometrists. Third, race interacts with some health condi-
tions, geographical location, income, sex, education, marital
status, and the use of unpaid IADL caregivers, or both. This
interaction decreases the likelihood that Black older persons
use some health care services and increases the likelihood
that they will use other health care services. Finally, the
Oaxaca decomposition indicates that race is not reducible to
a measure of socioeconomic status. Differences in personal
characteristics of Black and White elderly persons do not
fully explain racial differences in the use of medical ser-
vices. The observed racial differences in personal character-
istics should lead disabled White elderly persons to have a
lower probability of use of prescription medicines and phy-
sician services than disabled Black elderly persons. How-
ever, disabled White elderly persons have a higher probabil-
ity of use of both services.
This paper addresses racial patterns of medical utilization
by community-dwelling elderly patients. Use of institu-
tional care is not examined. Wallace and associates (1998)
document that Black elderly persons are less likely to be ad-
mitted to nursing homes. Thus, many community-dwelling
Black elderly persons have poorer health than community-
dwelling White elderly persons (Table 1). One would think
that this noninstitutional bias in the sample of community-
dwelling Black elderly persons would be associated with

RACIAL PATTERNS IN MEDICAL CARE S87
greater use of community services. However, this did not
occur. Thus, I investigate whether the observed racial pat-
terns are due to racial differences in sociodemographic
characteristics and/or availability, accessibility, and accept-
ability of services.
By using the methodological strategy of comprehensive
race interaction terms (i.e., measures that interact race with
income and insurance, as well as interact it with other per-
sonal characteristics of disabled elderly persons), I provide
some interesting and unexpected findings about racial dif-
ferences in predictors of medical service use. Although
some personal characteristics are associated with a lower
probability that Black older persons will use medical ser-
vices, I also find that some personal characteristics enhance
the ability of disabled older Black persons to obtain medical
services. For example, living in rural areas and small cities
increases the likelihood that older Black persons will have
prescriptions. Living in a rural area increases the likelihood
that older Black persons have a usual source of care and
small city residence increases the likelihood that older
Black persons will visit optometrists. Residence in the West
also facilitates greater use of medical services by disabled
older Black persons. Women as a group are more likely to
have a usual source of care and to visit physicians. The in-
teractive model indicates that disabled Black women are
more likely than their White counterparts to have these
types of visits. Black elderly persons have greater probabili-
ties of medical service utilization when they have IADLs,
joint and breathing problems, and broken parts.
My results exploring the role of race in influencing use of
paid in-home care are similar to those of Wolinsky and
Johnson (1991). I do not find a statistically significant coef-
ficient for the race dummy variable in this model. However,
I find significant interactive effects. Black elderly persons
who have joint problems are more likely to have a paid in-
home caregiver than their White counterparts. However, if
an unpaid IADL caregiver provides services in the home,
Black elderly persons are less likely than White elderly per-
sons to have a paid in-home caregiver. This finding under-
scores the importance of including race interaction terms to
obtain a comprehensive understanding of the role of race in
affecting medical service utilization among disabled elderly
persons.
One intriguing finding was the role of rural residence for
Black elderly persons, compared with White elderly per-
sons. With greater service availability in urban areas, I pre-
dict that elderly persons who live in rural areas will have
less use of services. Consistent with this prediction, I docu-
mented that rural residents were less likely to visit the den-
tist or foot doctor than their urban counterparts. However,
rural residents were more likely to see a physician when one
was needed. The interactive results also indicate that among
the services that rural Black elderly persons are more likely
to obtain are services of a usual source of care and prescrip-
tion drugs. They are more likely to receive these services
than their urban counterparts and White elderly persons
who live in urban and rural areas. Rural Black elderly per-
sons also are less likely than rural White elderly persons to
report that they didn't see a physician, but needed one.
Black elderly persons who live in rural areas are no more
likely than their urban counterparts to have a paid caregiver
or receive services from a dentist, foot doctor, optometrist,
therapist, emergency room, or a physician. More study is
needed of the context of care in rural areas and small cities
to understand the strategies that are leading Black elderly
persons in rural areas to have better access to care than
White elderly persons and Black elderly persons who live in
large urban areas.
The Oaxaca decomposition results indicate that racial dif-
ferences in health care access also occur due to factors typi-
cally excluded from our standard regression models of med-
ical utilization. These include life course discrimination,
receipt of culturally insensitive medical care, residential
segregation and its implications for convenient use of medi-
cal facilities, and information gaps about how different
races perceive disease patterns and healing. If researchers
do not consider these additional factors, disabled Black eld-
erly persons may continue to face relatively more con-
straints in their use of health care services, particularly phy-
sician services and prescription medications.
To some extent it is difficult to disentangle the indepen-
dent and interactive effects of discrimination, culture, per-
ceptions of racism, geographic segregation, and physical
proximity of medical facilities as they contribute to explain-
ing a large part of the racial difference in medical services
use by disabled elderly persons. The role that discrimination
and racism play in the use of medical services is currently a
topic of investigation, primarily in studies that use small
area (city and county) data. Wallace's (1990b, 1990c) re-
search indicates that racial differences in elderly Black per-
sons' use of medical care are not primarily due to cultural
factors. Rather, residential segregation and racial discrimi-
nation in the medical care system explain them, as well as
the class factors associated with the profit motive of the
health care system. The closure, relocation, and flight of
hospitals and medical providers from low income neighbor-
hoods where elderly Black persons live have led to racial
disparities in access to care. In addition, racial differences in
the intensity of care and profit-centered motives to mini-
mize the number of Medicaid patients treated account for
further racial disparities in care (Charatz-Litt, 1992). In a
case study of metropolitan elderly persons in Missouri,
Wallace (1990a) found that racial prejudice was one factor
that made in-home services undesirable even for older per-
sons with severe health problems. Cultural differences and
cultural insensitivity may influence medical treatment when
there is poor communication between providers and patients
about descriptions of pain, folk medicine, traditions, and
views of wellness or illness (Watson, 1994).
The research results presented in this paper use national
data and remind us that although we are in an era when we
repeatedly hear that discrimination no longer exists nor
needs a remedy, it may nonetheless contribute significantly
to racial differences in the use of a vital necessity of life. At
a minimum, this study suggests that ethnogeriatric curricula
in health professional schools and race conscious efforts in
planning and provision of medical services are two proac-
tive strategies to mitigate racial differences in the receipt of
medical services that are commonly used by disabled older
persons (Brangman, 1995; Wallace, 1990c).
S88 WHITE-MEANS
Public policy that focuses on enhancing health insurance
coverage will provide a remedy for increasing the probabil-
ity of use of prescription medications. Enhanced insurance-
financed access to prescription drugs is currently promoted
by Senator Kennedy and the Democratic party. They pro-
pose a $200 deductible and a 20% copayment by elderly
persons for their prescription medications, thus establishing
a Medicare prescription drug benefit. The regression results
clearly illustrate the benefits of such a policy change. In the
prescription drug model that includes the race dummy vari-
able (Table 3) and in the stratified models (Table 4) I note
that those insured solely by Medicare are less likely to use
prescription medications than those insured by Medicaid or
Medicare and private insurance supplements. A Medicare
prescription drug benefit would provide those covered by
Medicare only with coverage comparable to Medicaid and
private insurance supplements.
Our results also illustrate that there are race-specific pol-
icy implications of such a policy change. In the stratified
prescription drug models (Table 4), coverage by Medicare
only is statistically significant for both Black and White
older persons, with coverage decreasing the probability of
prescription drug use. However, Black older persons are
more likely (31%) than White older persons (18%) to have
coverage by Medicare only. Thus, this insurance policy
change disproportionately benefits Black older persons,
those who are currently less likely to use prescription medi-
cines.
In contrast, the Breaux-Thomas Medicare Reform Pro-
posal introduces some policy changes that may dispropor-
tionately disadvantage White older persons. In addition to
providing a new benefit package, reformed Medicare would
include higher copayments on some services, higher deduct-
ibles on Part B service use, and premium protection for low
income elderly persons. Many older persons may perceive
higher deductibles and copayments as reductions in Medi-
care coverage. The significant Medicare-only coefficient in
the stratified physician visit regression for White older per-
sons only suggests that these changes may decrease use of
physician services among White older persons only. In ad-
dition, because Black older persons have significantly less
income than White older persons (Table 1), a race-specific
policy implication of the Breaux-Thomas Premium Support
Program is that Black older persons will be more likely to
receive this enhanced benefit.
Similar to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Breaux-
Thomas Medicare Reform Proposal emphasizes competi-
tion among health plans (especially HMOs) for Medicare
beneficiaries. States are moving forward in their implemen-
tation of managed long-term care due to budget shortfalls
and an average 12% growth rates of the Medicaid program,
projected insolvency of the federal Medicare program, and a
projected increase of 23% in the population aged 85 and
older. According to the research findings, these policy changes
may also have race-specific implications. The Kaiser Com-
mission on the Future of Medicaid's review of more than
100 published studies in the literature indicated that it is not
possible to conclude whether managed care has maintained
a balance of containing cost and providing quality health
care services (Kaiser Family Foundation's Commission, 1995).
Managed care may increase access to care among under-
served Black elderly persons through its integration of care
delivery and financing. Alternatively, it may facilitate the
continuance of historical discrimination and lead to new
forms of discrimination against elderly patients who are
more costly to treat, that is, community-dwelling disabled
Black elderly persons (Rosenbaum et al., 1997). A third al-
ternative is that managed care may decrease overutilization
of services by disabled White elderly persons and have no
effect on utilization by Blacks.
From the Oaxaca decomposition analysis we learn that
disabled White elderly persons have greater access to medi-
cal services and (given their personal characteristics) should
use less services than Blacks. It is possible to interpret this
greater access by Whites as overutilization that managed
care may correct. Due to their greater dependency on Medi-
caid (Table 1), Black elderly persons will face a higher risk
of reduced health care access if managed care facilitates his-
torical discrimination; and a higher probability of enhanced
health care access if managed care facilitates coordination
of service use.
The central finding of this research is that race matters in
the use of community services among disabled older per-
sons and in the implications of health policy changes. The
general consensus in the literature is that when a race
dummy variable is significant, we know that race has an im-
portant and unique role in influencing the use of community
services. This article also shows that even when a race
dummy variable is not significant, race matters. There are
often racial differences in the predictors of the use of medi-
cal services. Further, these persistent racial differences are
likely (at least partly) a function of unmeasured racism.
Thus, public policy that focuses solely on health finance
may not remedy the existing racial disparities in health lev-
els, a key factor affecting both the cost of health care and
the overall quality of life in our nation.
