Abstract
Objective: To identify consumption patterns of fruit and vegetables within a
representative sample of US adults with a focus on degree of produce processing
and to explore sociodemographic, lifestyle and nutritional profiles associated with
these patterns.
Design: Cross-sectional analysis. Fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption data
were collected using two non-consecutive 24 h recalls. For the purpose of the
study, F&V intakes were aggregated into seven subgroups indicating degree of
processing, which afterwards were used as inputs into cluster analysis.
Setting: The 2005­2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
Subjects: The sample consisted of 2444 adults aged 20­59 years.
Results: Total average F&V intake of the adults was below the recommended
level. Thereby, 20 % of the respondents consumed fruit only in the form of juice.
Three F&V consumption patterns were identified: `low-intake F&V consumers'
(74 % of respondents), `consumers of healthier F&V options' (13 %) and `intensive
fruit juice consumers' (13 %). These groups differed markedly in terms of their
sociodemographic, lifestyle and health characteristics, such as gender, age, race/
ethnicity, education, smoking, weight status, etc. Differences in nutrient profiles
were also found, with the `consumers of healthier F&V options' showing better
nutritional quality compared with other clusters.
Conclusions: Only a small share of US adults combines high F&V intakes with
healthier F&V options that lead to a better nutritional profile. This raises discussion
about a need to deliver more specific F&V promotion messages, including advice
on healthier preparation methods, especially for the specific population groups.

NHANES
Scientific evidence supports an important role of fruit and
vegetables (F&V) as naturally healthy, nutrient-dense and
low-energy foods, in a balanced diet and in prevention
of many chronic diseases(1­3). A large amount of literature
has investigated the fruit and vegetable (F&V) intakes of
populations and their correspondence to the existing
recommendations(4­7). Thereby, F&V have most often
been considered as a combined variable or differentiated
by botanical characteristics, e.g. citrus fruits, berries, dark
green vegetables and legumes. However, there has been
less focus on the actual F&V consumption patterns, i.e. the
way F&V are incorporated into diets, which certainly
contributes to the overall diet healthiness. Thus, one might
choose to eat F&V in their natural low-energy form, as well
as use cooking techniques such as deep-fat frying, serving
with high-fat dressings or sauces or including in high-fat
mixtures, which greatly increase the energy and fat content
in the dish and thus reduce the healthiness of the pro-
duce(8). Canned F&V may contribute to the rise of total
energy consumed, when prepared with added sugar and
heavy syrups, and may also contain added salt. Although
fruit juice is rich in a number of micronutrients, it loses the
fibre present in a whole fruit and is often a source of
additional energy. Moreover, a whole fruit provides higher
satiety than does juice, and may therefore contribute to
weight management(9). Consequently, a `5-a-day' message
aimed at encouragement of F&V intake might be of little
support to health in the case of insufficient attention to the
way F&V are incorporated into diets. In this context,
defining the F&V intake patterns among the population is
of special interest. Cluster analysis presents a methodolo-
gical approach widely used for identification of dietary
patterns as it groups individuals with similar characteristics
into homogeneous, mutually exclusive groups(10­13).

The main objective of the present study is to identify
F&V intake patterns of US adults on the basis of the degree
of processing of the consumed F&V using a clustering
procedure. Specifically, the current study presents: (i) F&V
classification with respect to their degree of processing
and description of intakes from the created subgroups;
(ii) derivation of F&V consumption patterns; (iii) exploration
of sociodemographic and behavioural differences across
clusters; and (iv) comparison of their nutritional profiles.
Methods
Study sample and survey data
The US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 2005­2006, with responses from adults of 20­59
years of age, who were non-pregnant and non-lactating
and had reliable 2d dietary information and F&V intake
data, provided data for the analysis. The final study sample
comprised 2444 persons (87% of the NHANES 2005­2006
adult sample). Details on the design of the NHANES survey
are given elsewhere(14,15). Briefly, the NHANES is a pro-
gramme of studies conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention designed to assess the health and nutritional
status of adults and children in the USA. It is a nationwide
probability sample of the population selected via complex
multistage probability techniques. Sample weights and
sample design variables that compensate for different
probability of selection, non-response and post-stratification
should be used to obtain representative results. F&V con-
sumption information was collected from each respondent
by means of two non-consecutive 24h dietary recalls. Total
nutrient intakes were calculated for each interviewee by
NCHS and were available in the data set. Data on smoking
status and other behavioural characteristics were obtained
by standardized questionnaires. Body weight and height
were measured by trained specialists.
Fruit and vegetable classification
The NHANES 2005­2006 provides detailed information
about consumed F&V, including their form (i.e. whole,
juice), degree of processing (i.e. cooked, canned) and
additional ingredients. The intakes of F&V as a part of
composite dishes, e.g. soups, sandwiches, stews and
pizzas, can be accounted for. Data preparation covered
screening the reported 2 d F&V intakes and grouping
them into subgroups with respect to the degree of
processing using the codes of the Food and Nutrient
Database for Dietary Studies of the US Department of
Agriculture (USDA)(16). In total, 430 codes for fruit and
1566 codes for vegetable groups including legumes were
available. Table 1 presents the description of the created
subgroups. In the present study, fruits refer to whole fruit
eaten in all forms and 100 % fruit juice. The following
fruit subgroups were created: raw, juice and canned/
frozen/dried/desserts. More detailed subdivision was
not feasible because of: (i) the initial food coding in the
data set (i.e. no consistent distinction between canned,
cooked and frozen produce); and (ii) a very small num-
ber of persons who reported consumption of dried fruits
and fruit desserts. The vegetable group consists of dark-
green, deep-yellow produce, tomatoes, other vegetables,
legumes, potatoes (including fried potatoes but exclud-
ing potato chips) and other starchy vegetables in all
preparation forms. Inclusion of legumes and potatoes
with other starchy tubers into the group of vegetables
varies among studies(17). Owing to the fact that these
foods constitute a part of the Food Guide Pyramid
recommendations about vegetable consumption(18), they
were classified into the vegetable category. The following
subgroups were created: raw vegetables, consumed
with and without dressings; cooked vegetables, served
without dressings, creams and non-vegetable items;
vegetables in mixed dishes, including those served with
creams, dressings and non-vegetable items; and fried
vegetables.

Nutritional quality
To examine nutritional profiles associated with the iden-
tified F&V intake patterns, an index of nutritional quality
(INQ) was applied. This approach allows the analysis
of nutritional adequacy of an individual within the
energy needs. The INQ is defined as the ratio of nutrient
density to the amount of this nutrient recommended for
the maintenance of good health within a given energy
requirement(21,22). The actual densities of the selected
nutrients were calculated on the basis of the person's 2 d
average intakes(11,19,20). The nutrient densities based on
the recommendations of the USDA Food Guide(23) served
as a reference. Therefore,
INQ ¼ nutrient density=recommendations of USDA
Food Guide per 4184 kJ ð1000 kcalÞ:
INQ was calculated separately for each of the selected
key nutrients related to F&V intake (i.e. dietary fibre, K,
Ca, Mg, vitamins C and A) and to undesirable health
factors (i.e. total fat, total SFA, total sugar, Na, choles-
terol). INQ values .1?0 may be seen as desirable for
fibre, K, Ca, Mg and vitamins C and A, and as undesirable
for fats, sugar, Na and cholesterol.
Statistical methods
Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences statistical software pack-
age version 17?0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To identify
groups of subjects with similar F&V eating patterns, a two-
stage clustering procedure, advocated in the literature
because of higher validity of cluster solution, was
applied(24). The 2 d average intakes of the created F&V
subgroups were used as continuous inputs. Hierarchical
cluster analysis with squared Euclidean distance was
run to determine the number of clusters and was followed
by K-means clustering. An optimal number of clusters
was decided on the basis of inspection of the change
in agglomeration coefficients. Because all variables were
measured at the same scale, they were not standardized
before the analysis. Reliability of the cluster solution was
checked by performing the procedure multiple times,
changing algorithms and methods, as well as by splitting
the sample into halves and analysing each one indepen-
dently(25). The stability of the cluster solution was tested
through discriminant analysis. Distribution differences in
sociodemographics, lifestyles and health status associated
with the derived groups were examined with the x2 test.
ANOVA with least significant difference test for multiple
comparisons was applied to assess mean differences
among clusters by F&V intakes. All P values were two-
sided (P , 0?05). Except clustering, all statistical analyses
were performed on the weighted sample(10). Means and
standard errors were estimated in an SPSS 17?0 Complex
Samples module that allowed the use of sampling weights
and sample design variables and, thus, the production of
representative estimates for the selected group of the
civilian, non-institutionalized US population.

potatoes and other starchy produce(1). Fruit juice and raw
fruits were the main contributors to the fruit group, with
237 and 139 g/person on average, respectively. In the
vegetable group, adults reported on average the highest
intakes of cooked (105 g) and raw vegetables (91 g).
Fruits in the `canned/frozen/dried/desserts' form, as
well as vegetables in mixed dishes and fried, were less
important in terms of absolute amounts. Furthermore, as
shown in the Appendix (Fig. A1), 20 % of the interviewees
incorporated fruit into their diets only in the form of juice
on both recall days. About 81 % of the adults consumed
vegetables in more than one predefined form.
Cluster solutions for fruit and vegetable
intake patterns
Three consumption patterns were identified as the most
adequate representation of the combinations of F&V
subgroups in the diet of adults. Further splitting of the
clusters led to a smaller heterogeneity among them and
did not result in additional information about the intake
patterns. The discriminant function analysis performed
on the derived clusters also indicated a good stability
of the chosen three-cluster solution. The percentage of
correct classifications, i.e. the `hit ratio', was 93?0 %.
All input variables (i.e. created F&V subgroups), except
fruit as `canned/frozen/dried/desserts' and vegetables in
mixed dishes, contributed significantly to the formation of
clusters. Tables 2 and 3 present data for the three clusters
on F&V intakes, as well as on sociodemographic and
behavioural characteristics.
The first segment represents the largest group of 1802
persons (74 % of adults). They are characterized by low
intakes from all the F&V subgroups with a total average
intake of 255 g/d. Therefore, the cluster may be described
as `low-intake F&V consumers'. A large share of these
individuals reported to have a lower education, to smoke
and to eat out often/very often. Only one quarter of them
evaluated their own diet as excellent/very good. The
overweight/obesity rate was 67?4 %, the highest across
the groups (P 5 0?047).
The second cluster consists of 323 individuals (13 % of
adults). Participants of this group consumed on average
about 600 g of F&V/d. Compared with other segments,
they stated higher consumption of raw fruits (P 5 0?000)
and raw vegetables (P 5 0?023), as well as of cooked
vegetables without dressings (P 5 0?000). The intake of
fried vegetables was significantly lower here (P 5 0?022).
On the basis of this, the cluster was labelled `consumers

of healthier F&V options'. In comparison with the other
groups, females, older respondents, married persons and
individuals with higher education and household income
constituted a large share of the segment. Over a half of
the group (53 %) judged their own diet as excellent/very
good. Moreover, the share of overweight/obese adults
was the lowest here (58?6 %).
The third cluster is a group of 319 persons (13 % of
adults) whose F&V consumption is characterized by a
high share of fruit juice. Although their total F&V intake
was over 700 g/d, exclusion of fruit juice from this cal-
culation reduced the amount to only 284 g. The cluster
was named `intensive fruit juice consumers'. Compared
with other segments, males, younger interviewees, non-
Hispanic blacks and persons with lower household
income were highly represented here. Overweight/obese
individuals constituted 64?2 % of the cluster.
Nutrient profiles of the clusters
Figure 1 gives an overview of the nutritional adequacy
among adults overall and across the clusters measured
by INQ of eleven key nutrients. All three clusters with
distinct F&V intake patterns showed a low nutritional
quality with respect to the USDA Food Guide recom-
mendations(23). Overconsumption of undesirable nutri-
ents (e.g. fats, Na) and insufficient consumption levels of
desirable nutrients (e.g. fibre, Ca, vitamins A and C) are
clearly prevailing. However, in the cluster `low-intake
F&V consumers', a greater share of the individuals
seemed to have a worse nutritional profile in comparison
with the other segments. A very small proportion of these
persons complied with the recommendations for the
considered nutrients. Although the pattern `consumers of
healthier F&V options' was associated with a higher
intake of healthy nutrients, the proportion of individuals
with adequate densities of fats, Na and cholesterol was
also low in this cluster. Compared with the other groups,
a higher share of the `intensive fruit juice consumers'
could reach the recommendation on vitamin C. However,
they had a lower adequacy in terms of sugar intake.
Discussion
The present study explored F&V consumption patterns
among adults in the USA with a special focus on the
preparation method of the consumed produce. The basic
motivation behind the study was that such healthy foods
as F&V might not be consumed in a healthy way, but
rather by using preparation techniques and additional
ingredients that significantly reduce their dietary and
health benefits. Therefore, it is of interest for public health
policy to monitor such trends and to determine groups
of individuals who might be targeted with more specific
nutritional advice.
According to the results, US adults do not consume
sufficient quantities of F&V, which is in line with pre-
vious research(7,26,27). Among the F&V preparation forms
explored in the study, fruit juice, raw fruits as well as
vegetables cooked and eaten without dressings and in a
raw form had the highest shares in the total average
intake. Consumption of F&V in other forms, e.g. fruit
as `canned/frozen/dried/desserts', vegetables in mixed
dishes and fried, was lower. Notably, about 20 % of the
respondents reported consumption of fruit only in the
form of juice. Such importance of fruit juice has been
shown by other studies. According to the results from
the NHANES 2003­2004, orange juice was the largest
contributor to overall fruit intake in the USA(26). Putnam
et al.(28) also indicated a low variety in the fruit intake
of Americans and showed that orange and apple juice,
out of over sixty fruit products from food supply data,
accounted for 25 % of all fruit servings in 2000. Results
of our study suggest that high fruit juice consumption
can be attributed to a particular group of adults named
in the study as `intensive fruit juice consumers' (13 % of
adults). Especially younger individuals, predominantly
males, non-Hispanic blacks and persons with lower
household income tend to show this consumption pat-
tern. While evaluating the impact of juice intake on diet
and health, several aspects should be considered. First, it
is important to bear in mind and to remind consumers

that, although fruit juice is rich in micronutrients, it
provides much less fibre than a whole fruit and can be a
source of additional energy. The US Dietary Guidelines
Advisory Committee emphasizes that no more than one
of the three recommended fruit servings should come
from fruit juice and the rest from whole fruit(29). Second,
the driving forces of a high juice intake need deeper
investigation. Among others, the convenience aspect
might play a determinative role in this decision. Con-
sumers might also perceive juice as an extremely healthy
and important component of their diet, and therefore
`the more, the better' rule is applied. They might also
believe to be able to fulfil the F&V recommendations
solely with juice. In this respect, clearer F&V promo-
tional messages including a special notion on fruit juice
could be beneficial.
The study also showed that the `low-intake F&V con-
sumers' pattern constitutes a prevailing share of the adult
population in the USA (74 % of adults). This group had
low intakes of all F&V subgroups, especially of raw
produce. Characteristics of the low-intake consumers
(e.g. lower education, non-Hispanic black race, unhealthy
lifestyles) are consistent with the results of previous
studies(7,15,28,30­32). Bertail and Caillavet(33), who studied
heterogeneity of F&V consumption patterns in France by
disaggregating intakes into subgroups by preparation
method, found that households with the lowest income
and lower education level of the reference member
tended to have the lowest total F&V intakes and,
furthermore, to consume less of raw F&V and more of
canned and frozen fruits as well as to spend a higher
budget share for vegetable-based convenience food.
However, the segment comprised predominantly of more
affluent consumers and those with higher education level
was positively associated with consumption of fresh
F&V. In our study, adults with similar characteristics
(e.g. higher education and income level, being older and
married) formed the pattern `consumers of healthier F&V
options' (13 % of adults). Compared with other clusters, a
smaller share of these individuals was overweight or
obese. Although the relationship between F&V intake
and obesity has been a focus of research, the results of
investigations are contradictory(8,9,34). Lin and Mentzer
Morrison(8) found a negative association between fruit
consumption and BMI, but no strong association with
respect to vegetables. They stated that the key to these
associations might be the way in which people tend to
consume the produce. Investigation of the links between
F&V intake and body weight should further explore
this issue.
Differences detected in the nutritional profiles of the
segments can be partly attributed to amounts, as well as
to preparation methods of F&V. Associations between
low F&V consumption and inadequate intakes of micro-
nutrients and fats found in the study are in line with
previous research(35). `Intensive fruit juice consumers'
could not meet the recommendations either, with the
exception of a considerably higher adequacy of vitamin C
intake. The pattern `consumers of healthier F&V options',
rich in low-energy-dense options (e.g. raw produce, F&V
cooked and served without dressings), was associated
with higher densities of healthy nutrients. However, the
share of individuals with adequate intakes of unhealthy
nutrients was still very low in this cluster. An explanation
could be that F&V are not eaten as substitutes for higher
energy foods. However, the present study did not look at
this aspect closely and there is a potential for further
research. Moreover, a combination of a higher F&V intake
with reduction of energy density in the diet is discussed in
the literature with respect to its importance for weight
management(4).
In interpreting our results, several methodological
issues must be taken into account. First, since only 2 d
dietary data were available, the question about the relia-
bility of the characterization of the individual's usual
intake may arise because of day-to-day variations in
consumption. Another aspect is application of cluster
analysis. Although it has an exploratory nature, this
method has been widely applied for identification of
population subgroups with distinct dietary patterns. In
the present study, we additionally used discriminant
analysis to confirm the stability of the chosen solution.
The study also has a number of strengths. First, the
sample was population based, which allows inferences
for the adult non-institutionalized population of the
USA. An important advantage of the used data set is
that it reflects F&V intakes from composite dishes (e.g.
soup, pizza, sandwich). Omission of this information is
considered to be a common problem leading to under-
reporting and bias in the studies on F&V intake(36).
Overall, the study contributes to the investigation of
F&V consumption in the USA by taking into consideration
not only amounts but also the preparation forms of the
consumed produce.
In conclusion, our results show that different patterns
of F&V consumption exist among US adults, which
contribute to the differences in their nutrient profiles. The
study suggests a need to monitor the current consump-
tion trends and especially the related disparities across
age, ethnic and educational groups. The delivery of more
specific F&V promotion messages, including the focus
on F&V options of a higher nutritional value, healthier
preparation methods and explicit substitution message,
might be considered.
