Introduction
The flavonoid compound Icariside II (also known as
Baohuoside I), which is derived from the stems and leaves
of Epimedium koreanum Nakai (Berberidaceae), has exhib-
ited potential anticancer activities.1,2 However, Icariside II
possesses a poor solubility in both water and organic sol-
vents. Furthermore, the significant efflux from cancer cells
also limits its clinical application.
Self-assembled micelle system is recognized as one of
the most promising strategies to deliver poorly soluble anti-
cancer drugs.3-5 In our previous study, a self-assembled
mixture of micelles (TPGS­Icariside II­phospholipid com-
plex) was constructed using phospholipid complex and
TPGS (d--tocopheryl polyetheyene glycol 1000 succi-
nate), which was capable of inhibiting the efflux and
improving the solubility of Icariside II.6 As an important
component of the cell membrane, phospholipids can sustain
membrane fluidity. They represent a well-known class of
biocompatibleandnoncytotoxicbiomolecules.Phospholipid
complexes have been successfully applied to improve the
permeability and bioavailability of drugs, such as clarithro-
mycin and curcumin.7,8 TPGS, containing a lipophilic non-
polar head and a hydrophilic tail, would be an ideal
solubilizer to provide high drug encapsulation and emulsifi-
cation efficiency for lipid-based drug delivery formula-
tions.9 Moreover, TPGS could reverse multidrug resistance
(MDR) by inhibiting the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) pump.10,11

Abstract
The biggest challenge for the treatment of multidrug resistant cancer is to deliver a high concentration of anticancer
drugs to cancer cells. Icariside II is a flavonoid from Epimedium koreanum Nakai with remarkable anticancer properties,
but poor solubility and significant efflux from cancer cells limited its clinical use. In our previous study, a self-assembled
mixture of micelles (TPGS­Icariside II­phospholipid complex) was successfully constructed, which could substantially
increase the solubility of Icariside II and inhibit the efflux on Caco-2 cells. In this study, we evaluate the anticancer effect
of the mixed micelles encapsulating Icariside II (Icar-MC) on MCF-7/ADR, a multidrug-resistant breast cancer cell line.
The cellular uptake of the micelles was confirmed by fluorescent coumarin-6-loaded micelles. The IC
50
of Icar-MC in
MCF-7/ADR was 2-fold less than the free drug. The in vitro study showed Icar-MC induced more apoptosis and lactate
dehydrogenase release. Intravenous injection of Icar-MC into nude mice bearing MCF-7/ADR xenograft resulted in a
better antitumor efficacy compared with the administration of free drug, without causing significant body weight changes
in mice. The antitumor effect was further verified by magnetic resonance imaging and immunohistochemical assays for Ki-
67, a proliferative indicator. Moreover, Icar-MC treatment also elevated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the expressions of cleaved
caspase-3, -8, -9 and AIFM1 in tumors. This study suggests that phospholipid/TPGS mixed micelles might be a suitable drug
delivery system for Icariside II to treat multidrug resistant breast cancer.

All these characteristics make them qualified surfactants to
overcome drug efflux.12 Breast cancer continues to be the
most common malignancy diagnosed in women world-
wide.13 MDR is considered as one of the main reasons for
the failure of cancer chemotherapy.14 The principal mecha-
nism of MDR is drug efflux from cancer cells by overex-
pressing P-gp.15
We assumed that phospholipid-TPGS micelles might be
a promising platform for improving the therapeutic efficacy
of Icariside II in drug-resistant cells. In this work, the in
vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy of Icar-MC against
MDR breast cancer cells was estimated.
Materials and Methods
Cell Culture and Reagents
The human breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and MCF-7/
ADR (an ADR-resistant breast cancer cell line) were pur-
chased from American Type Culture Collection and main-
tained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2
mM l-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (50 IU/mL
and 50 µg/mL, respectively) at 37°C in an atmosphere of
5% CO
2
. Icariside II was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) for in vitro experiments and was suspended in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.2% sodium car-
boxymethylcellulose (CMC-Na) for in vivo experiments.
Coumarin-6, Icariside II and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylin-
dole (DAPI) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
Icariside II-phospholipid complex was prepared by an
anhydrous cosolvent reduction vaporization method as pre-
viously described.6 All other chemicals were of high-
performance liquid chromatography or reagent grade and
used without further purification.
Uptake of Calcein-AM in MCF-7/ADR Cells
P-gp activity in the MCF-7 or MCF-7/ADR cells was
firstly examined with the Multidrug Resistance Assay Kit
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), which evaluates the mean
fluorescence of calcein AM accumulated in cells.16 Cells
were preincubated with increasing concentrations of cyclo-
sporinA(10-5 to 0.1 mg/mL) for 30 minutes. P-gp substrates
(Calcein-AM, 0.3 M) were added and cells were further
incubated for 30 minutes. At the end of incubation, intracel-
lular fluorescence of P-gp substrates was quantified by a
microplate reader (Bio-Rad iMark, Richmond, CA) at 488
nm. We further examined the P-gp activity in TPGS- or
empty micelles-treated MCF-7/ADR cells. Calcein AM (0.3
M) was added to the culture medium after cells had been
incubated with TPGS (0.18 mg/mL) or empty micelles (0.2
mg/mL) for 15 minutes. Coincubation lasted for another 15
minutes. The fluorescence was measured using a microplate
reader.
Cellular Uptake of the Coumarin-6-Loaded
Micelles
Fluorescent coumarin-6-loaded micelle has been a success-
ful model to investigate the cellular uptake of micelles.17-19
Coumarin-6-loaded micelles were prepared by replacing
Icariside II with coumarin-6 in the process of constructing
Icar-MC. After treatment with coumarin-6-loaded micelles
(6 µM) for 30 minutes, the cells were washed with PBS and
then the nuclei were counterstained by DAPI for 10 min.
The cells were washed again for fluorescence imaging.
In Vitro Cytotoxicity Study
In vitro cytotoxicity was determined using MTT assay.
MCF-7/ADR cells (2 × 104/well) were treated with free
Icariside II, Icar-MC (0-40 µM) or empty micelles (0.2 mg/
mL) for 12, 24, 48 hours, respectively. The absorbance at
570 nm was used to assess the relative cell viability from 3
independent experiments.
Lactate Dehydrogenase Release
The MCF-7/ADR cells (1 × 106 cells/mL) were treated with
Icar-MC or Icariside II at a concentration range of 0 to 40
µM for 12 hours. Released lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in
the media was measured with a cytotoxicity kit (Promega,
Madison, WI) with absorbance at 340 nm.
Analysis of Cell Apoptosis
After incubation with Icar-MC or Icariside II (25 µM) for
24 hours, the cells (1 × 106 cells/mL) were trypsinized,
washed with cold binding buffer, and suspended in Annexin
V-Alexa Fluor 488 binding buffer (200 µL) for 15 minutes
in darkness. The cells were diluted with binding buffer at a
total volume of 400 µL and analyzed immediately by flow
cytometry. Cells in the lower right quadrant represented
apoptosis and in the upper right quadrant represented necro-
sis or postapoptotic necrosis.
Efficacy Study in Xenografts in Mice
Athymic nude mice (18-20 g) were obtained from the SLAC
LabAnimal Center of Shanghai (Shanghai, China). They were
maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle at the temperature of
25°C ± 2°C and relative humidity of 50% ± 10% with water ad
libitum. This study and the experimental protocols were
approved by the InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) of Jiangsu ProvincialAcademy of Chinese Medicine
under the approval number JPA-081210-8.
MCF-7/ADR cells were injected subcutaneously into the
flank area of female nude mice. On day 0 (5 days after cell
implantation), tumor sizes reached an average of 75 mm3,
392 Integrative Cancer Therapies 15(3)
and mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 8):
group 1 (saline); group 2 (free Icariside II at 10 mg/kg, in
PBS with 0.2% CMC-Na); group 3 (empty micelles at 100
mg/kg, in PBS, pH 7.4); and group 4 (Icar-MC, containing
the same dose of Icariside II as group 2, in PBS, pH 7.4).
Treatments via intravenous injections or oral gavage began
on day 1. Mice in groups 1 and 2 were dosed through oral
gavage every 3 days for a total of 8 times (finished on day
24). Mice in groups 3 and 4 were injected intravenously
every 3 days for a total of 8 injections (finished on day 24).
Tumors were measured thrice a week with an electronic
caliper by using the formula: Tumor volume (mm3) = length
× width2/2. The experiment was ended at day 34, 10 days
after the last treatment (day 24), and all the mice left were
euthanized. During the experiment, mice with tumor size
exceeding 1000 mm3 were also euthanized. Tumors were
isolated immediately for further Western blotting and
immunohistochemical assays after euthanasia.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
The nude mice were subjected to magnetic resonance imag-
ing (MRI) (Excite Echospeed HD 1.5T, GE MRI system,
Waukesha, WI) on day 34.20 Coronal position, transverse
section (T1WI, T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging
(DWI) were employed using a matrix of 224 × 192 pixels,
and a slice thickness of 3 mm, interval 0.2 mm, field of
view 10 cm × 10 cm, 2NEX. T1WI: SE array, TR (repetition
time)/TE (echo time) = 550 ms/24ms. T2WI: FSE array,
TR/TE = 2920 ms/88 ms. DWI: SE/EPI, TR/TE = 4000
ms/71.6 ms, matrix = 64 × 96, 8NEX.
Western Blot Analysis
The protein levels in tissue homogenates were assessed with
the use of methods described previously.21 After the indi-
cated treatment, tissue homogenates were lysed in extract
buffer. Equal amounts of proteins from each set of experi-
ments were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate­polyacryl-
amide gel electrophoresis. The gel was transferred to
membrane and probed with either P-gp, Bax, caspase-3, -8,
-9, PARP, FADD, AIFM1, Bcl-2 antibodies, each obtained
from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). The pro-
tein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence
detection kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Densitometric
measurements of the scanned bands were performed using
Image pro plus (IPP) software program. Data were normal-
ized to -actin.
Immunohistochemical Studies
Sections (5 m) from paraformaldehyde-fixed tissues
were dewaxed with xylene and ethanol and then washed in
distilled water. After incubating in hydrogen peroxide to
quench endogenous peroxidase activity, the slides were
heated at 100°C to retrieve antigens. The slides were incu-
bated with anti-Ki-67 antibody from Nanjing Bioworld
Biotech Co Ltd. (Nanjing, China) for 1 hour, followed by
incubation with horseradish peroxidase­conjugated sec-
ondary antibody. Sections were then incubated with devel-
oping solution, and counterstained with hematoxylin.
Color was fixed with acid alcohol and dehydration steps.
Immunoreactivity was identified as brown nuclear or
cytoplasmic labeling in tumors counterstained with
hematoxylin.
Statistical Methods
The experiments exposed were representative from three
independent experiments. All descriptive statistics, includ-
ing mean ± SD, were performed. Student's t test was used to
evaluate differences between the control group and each
treatment group in all in vitro studies. For multigroup com-
parisons, a 2-way analysis of variance test was used. To
compare animal survivals, the log-rank test was used and
the results were shown with Kaplan-Meier curves.
Results
P-glycoprotein Activities in MCF-7/ADR Cells
Calcein AM was used as a substrate to evaluate the activity
of P-gp in the presence of increasing concentration of cyclo-
sporinA(a competitive inhibitor of P-gp). Previous research
reported that cyclosporin A displayed dose-dependent inhi-
bition of P-gp-mediated calcein AM efflux.22 Therefore,
greater retention of calcein AM means greater inhibitory
effects on the P-gp activity. As shown in Figure 1A, high
concentration of cyclosporin A induced retention of calcein
in MCF-7/ADR cells but not in MCF-7 cells, signifying that
P-gp was much more active in MCF-7/ADR cells. Moreover,
high level of P-gp proteins was detected in MCF-7/ADR
cells, as shown in Western blot assays (Figure 1B).
We further examined the P-gp activity in TPGS- or
empty micelles-treated MCF-7/ADR cells. Characterization
of Icar-MC has been carried out in our previous research,
demonstrating that this formulation was able to increase the
solubility and the permeability of Icariside II. New experi-
mental data from batches in this study are shown in Table 1.
The weight ratio of TPGS:empty micelle was 9:10 when
constructing Icariside II-loaded mixed micelles. The rela-
tive fluorescence value for retention of calcein AM was
69.5 ± 1.8 at the control group, 122.3 ± 12.8 in TPGS group
(0.18 mg/mL), and 113.4 ± 11.5 in empty micelles group
(0.2 mg/mL). It is obvious that TPGS or empty micelles
would increase calcein AM retention in MCF-7/ADR cells
(Figure 1C). However, both treatments failed to affect P-gp
protein levels in MCF-7/ADR cells (Figure 1D).

In Vitro Cellular Uptake
After incubation with the coumarin-6-loaded TPGS micelles
for 30 minutes, images of MCF-7/ADR cells are shown in
Figure 1E. The green fluorescence is emitted by coumarin-6
and the blue fluorescence is obtained from the DAPI chan-
nel. From the images, DAPI-stained nuclei are circumvented
by green fluorescence. This proves that micelles have
entered into the cellular cytoplasm.
In Vitro Cytotoxicity
The in vitro cytotoxicity of free Icariside II and Icariside
II-loaded mixed micelles in MCF-7/ADR cells was examined

with MTT assay. The result indicates that Icar-MC has advan-
tages in achieving higher cytotoxicity than the free drug. The
IC
50
of Icar-MC (12.6 ± 0.6 µM) in MCF-7/ADR cells was
found to be 2-fold less than the free Icariside II (25.2 ± 0.7
µM) (P < .01) after 24-hour incubation. The IC
50
of Icar-MC
(8.7 ± 0.4 µM) was 1.5-fold less than the free drug (13.3 ± 0.5
µM) (P < .05) after 48-hour incubation (Figure 2A). The cyto-
toxicity of empty micelles was evaluated on MCF-7/ADR to
discriminate the effect of Icar-MC from empty micelles. Our
results confirmed that the empty micelles at 0.2 mg/mL are
noncytotoxic to MCF-7/ADR cells. The P-gp inhibiting effect
by the TPGS makes these micelles a better nanocarrier for
Icariside II delivery. It allows sustaining the drug concentra-
tion inside the cell, resulting in a more potent cytotoxic effect.
Icar-MC-treated cells had higher level of LDH release com-
pared to free Icariside II at all concentrations (0-40 µM)
(Figure 2B). Statistical analysis showed that the difference in
LDH release between Icariside II and Icar-MC was significant
at 20 and 40 µM. In accordance with MTT assay, Icar-MC
treatment resulted in higher apoptotic cells than Icariside II
(Figure 2C). This experiment was repeated three times, and
the difference is statistically significant (P < .05).
Assessment of In Vivo Therapeutic Efficacy
The tumor volumes of MCF-7/ADR xenograft and weights
of nude mice were measured thrice a week. The tumor vol-
ume kept increasing in the mice treated with saline (Figure 3,
Table 2). On day 24 (the last treatment), 5 out of the 8 mice
with tumors exceeding the size limit of 1000 mm3 were euth-
anized. The rest of the mice in the saline group were eutha-
nized successively once the tumors reached the size limit.
Empty micelles (200 mg/kg) exhibited no tumor inhibition
on nude mice. On day 25, one death occurred in the empty
micelles group due to tumor burden. None of the animals in
this group survived to the end of the study (day 34, 10 days
after they were given the last treatment).
Icariside II is almost insoluble in aqueous solutions;
therefore, it was orally given in PBS with 0.2% CMC-Na at
pH 7.4. Free Icariside II (10 mg/kg) exhibited weak inhibi-
tion on tumor growth, without statistical significance com-
pared to the saline group. In the Icariside II group, three
mice received euthanasia successively due to exceeding the
tumor size limit. Five mice survived to the end of the study
in the Icariside II group (day 34).
Strong suppression of tumor volume was observed in
animals receiving Icar-MC (10 mg/kg of Icariside II basis),
compared to the saline group (P < .05). At the end of the
study, the mean tumor size was 285 mm3 from an initial
average volume of 75 mm3. Two out of the 8 mice had obvi-
ous tumor regression. There is a statistical significance
between free Icariside II and Icariside II-loaded micelles (P
< .05). MRI analysis of the mice harvested at the end of the
experiment demonstrated that the tumor volumes differed
significantly between the Icariside II and Icar-MC groups
(Figure 3C).
To estimate the adverse effects of the mixed micelle for-
mulations, body weight of the mice was also recorded dur-
ing the treatment and the results are shown in Figure 3D. It
can be easily observed that the average body weight of the
mice in all groups showed similar trends: slow increase in
the initial 7 days, quick increase between 8 and 12 days, and
unchanged afterward.
Immunohistochemical Assays
We carried out immunohistochemistry assay in tumors to
examine the cell proliferation indicator Ki-67. As expected,
Ki-67-positivecellsweredecreasedinIcar-MC-treatedtumors,
indicating the reduction of proliferated cells (Figure 4). These
findings strengthened the conclusion that Icar-MC had greater
therapeutic efficacy than Icariside II alone.
Expressions of Apoptosis-Related Proteins
We then investigated the molecular mechanisms responsi-
ble for the antitumor effect of Icar-MC. -actin is not a good
loading control when apoptosis is induced. We used Hsc70
as the loading control which was less sensitive to caspase
cleavage. Icar-MC enhanced the levels of Bax, cleaved cas-
pase-8, -9, -3, cleaved PARP, and AIFM1 compared with
vehicle; decreased the expressions of Bcl-2 in tumor tissues
(Figure 5). Icar-MC induced apoptosis involving both the
intrinsic and extrinsic signaling pathways. Free Icariside II
also displayed a tendency to modulate the expressions of
apoptosis-related proteins, but to a lesser extent. Thus,
mixed micelles made of TPGS and phospholipid complexes
allowed for a strong pro-apoptotic effect of Icariside II.
Discussion
This study was designed to investigate whether self-
assembled micelles can enhance Icariside II absorption
and overcome MDR. We have shown several important

points: (a) TPGS and empty micelles inhibited P-gp activ-
ity, and in vitro cellular uptake of fluorescent coumarin-
6-loaded micelles was confirmed; (b) the micelle strategy
was able to enhance the cytotoxicity of Icariside II on
MCF-7/ADR cells, and inducing apoptosis is the major
mechanism responsible for the cytotoxicity; (c) a remark-
able effect on tumor inhibition was observed in MCF-7/
ADR xenografts by Icar-MC; and (d) Icar-MC regulated
the expressions of apoptosis-related proteins in vivo.
Most MDR cases are largely attributed to the overex-
pression of P-gp, a 170-kDa plasma membrane ATPase.
P-gp is expressed in approximately 40% of breast cancer
tumors; and such tumors are 3 times less likely to respond
to chemotherapy than those that do not express P-gp.23 As a
broad-spectrum multidrug efflux pump, P-gp can recognize
a variety of structurally unrelated chemotherapeutic agents,
called P-gp substrates.24 Our study showed that MCF-7/
ADR cells expressed higher levels of P-gp and more

activity of P-gp than MCF-7 cells, which is in accordance
with previous research that the P-gp efflux pump is essen-
tial in the multidrug-resistant phenotype of the MCF-7
cells.25
The use of TPGS, as a drug delivery vehicle to treat
MDR cancers is a rapidly developing area. TPGS can pre-
vent P-gp-mediated efflux and elevate drug bioavailability.
Furthermore, TPGS has been used as a sole excipient and a
brilliant emulsifier to reverse paclitaxel drug resistance in
ovarian cancer cells.26,27 Also, TPGS itself has cancer-fight-
ing properties, though the mechanism is unclear. In light of
these findings, TPGS is incorporated into Icariside II­
phospholipid complex to produce the mixture of micelles.
In this study, the mixed micelles successfully reduced the
efflux of Icariside II in Caco-2 cell monolayers.6 TPGS
upregulated calcein AM retention level in MCF-7/ADR

cells without changing P-gp protein levels. Calcein AM was
used as a substrate to evaluate P-gp activity. Greater reten-
tion of calcein AM means greater inhibitory effects on the
P-gp activity. Here, it can be inferred that mixed micelles
inhibited the P-gp activity directly rather than modulating
P-gp protein expressions.
As expected, data obtained from in vitro MTT study
showed that Icar-MC exhibited stronger inhibitory effect on
the proliferation of MCF-7/ADR cells than Icariside II.
Also in this work, the progressive changes of the tumor vol-
ume in the MCF-7/ADR xenografted nude mice confirmed
the higher antitumor activity of Icar-MC as compared to
free drug at a comparable dosage of Icariside II. Namely,
the behavior of Icar-MC in vivo correlated well with their in
vitro interaction with tumor cells. As a tumor-fighting drug,
the cellular uptake of Icariside II is a predominant process
for its therapeutic efficacy. Previous research has empha-
sized that the addition of the TPGS into polymeric nanopar-
ticles can increase the cellular uptake in tumor.28 In vitro
cellular uptake results obtained here also confirmed this.
This formulation promoted intracellular accumulation of
Icariside II in cells, which could explain the improvement
of the anticancer efficiency in vitro and in vivo.
In the in vivo experiment, free drug is applied orally and
the mixed micelle intravenously. Plasma concentrations of
Icariside II from the 2 formulations were reported in our
previous work. The average value of C
max
is 298.87 ng/mL
after oral administration of free drug, while the average
value of C
max
reached 798.65 ng/mL after oral administra-
tion of Icar-MC.6 Here, we concluded that except for the
more significant uptake of Icar-MC over Icariside II by can-
cer cells and overcoming drug resistance, the improved
plasma concentration of Icariside II might also contribute to
the difference in anticancer efficacies. Moreover, the in
vivo activity of Icariside II-loaded micelles may also be
improved by their augmented accumulation in tumor tissues
due to the enhanced permeability and retention effect. The
tissue concentration of free Icariside II and Icar-MC should
be evaluated in our future study to elucidate the effect of
enhanced tumor accumulation.
In conclusion, this study has identified a novel drug
delivery system, self-assembled micelle for encapsulation
and delivery of Icariside II in P-gp-mediated drug-resis-
tant cancers. The study provides a rationale for the contin-
ued investigation of Icar-MC as a promising anticancer
therapy.
