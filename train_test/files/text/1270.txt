Lower intake of the essential trace element selenium may be a risk factor for prostate cancer and other cancers.
In the United States, many racial disparities in cancer incidence, such as the 61% higher incidence of prostate
cancer among Blacks relative to Whites, remain unexplained. Using data from a large, nationally representative
survey, the authors explored Black/White differences in serum selenium concentration. Mean serum selenium
concentrations, both crude and adjusted for known predictors of serum selenium, were determined for 10,779
Black and White males and females aged 12 years who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (1988­1994). Crude mean serum selenium concentrations were 126.35 ng/ml for Whites and
118.76 ng/ml (~6% lower) for Blacks. Adjustment for known serum selenium predictors, including a proxy for
residence at the county level, reduced the racial disparity, although concentrations remained approximately 3%
lower in Blacks than in Whites of both sexes (p < 0.0001). The observation that Blacks had lower unadjusted and
adjusted serum selenium concentrations relative to Whites is intriguing, given the racial disparity in incidence of
prostate cancer and other cancers.

The essential trace element selenium has been the focus
of a number of recent scientific investigations because of its
anticarcinogenic potential (1­3). Selenium is essential to the
functioning of several enzymes, including the antioxidant
enzyme glutathione peroxidase; it helps maintain a healthy
immune system and plays a role in many other aspects of
human health (2).
Selenium is found throughout the food supply. The richest
sources are cereal grains, meats, and fish, although con-
centrations in food vary considerably according to the soil
content of the geographic region where the food was pro-
duced (4). In China, two endemic diseases, a type of car-
diomyopathy called Keshan disease and a type of deforming
arthritis called Kashin-Bek disease, have been attributed to
selenium deficiency (2). Selenium intake that is sufficient
to prevent these diseases may nevertheless be inadequate
to reduce the risk of other diseases, most notably cancer
(1, 5­8).
In ecologic studies conducted in the 1960s and 1970s,
investigators reported moderately strong inverse associa-
tions between low regional levels of selenium and increased
cancer incidence or mortality (9­11). Subsequently, obser-
vational epidemiologic studies and clinical trials have pro-
vided mixed but encouraging evidence that higher exposure
to selenium, as measured in the blood, toenails, or diet, is
associated with a decreased risk of cancer, particularly
cancer of the prostate but also lung and colorectal cancer
(1, 12­16).

Racial differences in cancer rates, including those cancers
hypothesized to be associated with low selenium levels, are
striking and largely unexplained. Relative to men of other
racial/ethnic groups in the United States, Black men expe-
rience the highest total cancer incidence and mortality rates
(17). The greatest disparity is for prostate cancer, with in-
cidence and mortality rates being 61 percent and 146 per-
cent higher in Blacks than in Whites, respectively. Among
women, cancer incidence is highest in Whites, mostly be-
cause of higher breast cancer rates, whereas Black women
lead other racial/ethnic groups in cancer mortality (17).
Racial variation in serum selenium concentration may
explain some of the Black/White disparity in cancer rates.
Such variation has been previously reported, most notably
in an analysis of data from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) that focused
on the association between serum selenium levels and
demographic factors (18). Although those authors reported
that Blacks had significantly lower serum selenium levels
relative to Whites, they did not present results adjusted for
the influence of important predictors of serum selenium that
could potentially confound the racial differences. It was our
objective in this study to further investigate the Black/White
disparity in serum selenium levels using NHANES III data
and adjusting for known predictors of serum selenium con-
centration, including location of residence at approximately
the county level (4, 18­25).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and sampling technique
In this study, we used serologic and interview data from
NHANES III, a national survey conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention) between 1988 and 1994 (26­30). The survey was
designed to assess the health and nutritional status of the
civilian, noninstitutionalized US population aged 2 months
or older. Although certain groups, such as Blacks, were over-
sampled in order to permit subgroup analyses, the use of
sample weights in the analysis allows for generalization of
the results to the US population. In-person interviews were
conducted in sampled households, and all subjects were in-
vited to participate in medical examinations conducted at
a nearby NHANES III mobile examination center. Details of
the survey design and examination procedures have been
previously published (31, 32).
Of 39,695 eligible NHANES III participants, 30,818 (78
percent) completed a home interview and were examined in
the mobile examination center. Serum selenium concentra-
tion was measured in 18,292 participants aged 12 years or
older. Racial/ethnic groups other than non-Hispanic Blacks
and non-Hispanic Whites (hereafter referred to as ``Blacks''
and ``Whites'') were excluded, leaving 12,321 participants.
Subsequent exclusions were made for participants who ei-
ther were currently pregnant (n ¼ 183) or were missing data
on predictor variables used to adjust for potential confound-
ing (n ¼ 1,359). Therefore, the current study included
10,779 participants (4,369 Blacks and 6,410 Whites).
Data collection
Blood specimens were obtained from participants by ve-
nipuncture. Selenium was measured in serum samples using
atomic absorption spectrometry at 196 nm; details of this
procedure have been published elsewhere (33­35).
As noted above, for our sample, race was self-reported
as Black or White. We categorized age at interview into
10-year groups, except for ages 12­14 years and 15­19 years.
Region of residence (Northeast, Midwest, South, or West)
was used as a proxy for geographic location. Cigarette smok-
ing was quantified as the average number of cigarettes
smoked per day among current smokers. Never smokers
were defined as persons who had smoked fewer than 100
cigarettes in their lifetime, while former smokers were per-
sons who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime
but reported no current smoking. Alcohol intake was quan-
tified as the average number of alcoholic drinks (i.e., a
12-ounce (0.4-liter) beer, a 4-ounce (118-ml) glass of wine,
or a 1-ounce (30-ml) shot of liquor) consumed per week
among current drinkers. Never drinkers were defined as per-
sons who had consumed fewer than 12 drinks in their life-
time, while former drinkers were defined as those who had
consumed at least 12 drinks in their lifetime but reported no
drinking within the past 12 months.
Body mass index, a measure of obesity defined as weight
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, was cat-
egorized according to clinical guidelines set by the National
Institutes of Health (36). The poverty index ratio (PIR) was
used as a proxy for socioeconomic status. The PIR repre-
sents reported total combined family income over the past
12 months divided by the current federal poverty threshold
for a family of that size; a PIR of less than 1 is considered
poverty (37). Dietary intake of selenium was derived from
the 24-hour dietary recall that was administered to partic-
ipants who underwent examination at a mobile examination
center. The nutrient database of the University of Minnesota
Nutrition Coordinating Center was used to quantify selenium
intake, which excluded supplementary selenium (38, 39);
selenium intake can be interpreted as the total amount of
selenium consumed on any given day.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analyses for this study were performed
using SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North
Carolina) and the SAS-callable version (version 9.0.0) of
SUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle
Park, North Carolina), a statistical software package that
takes into account sample weighting and the complex,
multistage probability sample design of NHANES III. De-
mographic characteristics were compared by race using chi-
squared tests. For each sex separately and for both sexes
combined, crude mean serum selenium concentrations were
calculated for persons who reported their race as either
Black or White.
In order to assess the degree to which various factors
explained the Black/White disparity in serum selenium con-
centration, four linear regression models were constructed
which included known predictors of serum selenium

concentration (4, 18­25). For each sex separately and for
both sexes combined, the first model was adjusted for age
only; the second was additionally adjusted for current smok-
ing status, current alcohol consumption, body mass index,
and PIR. Region of residence was added to the third model.
Because geographic location of residence is an important
predictor of selenium intake (4), a fourth model was con-
structed that adjusted for NHANES III primary sampling
unit (PSU) in addition to all of the variables used in the
second model. The PSUs are sampled areas where the par-
ticipant resided and represent, in most cases, individual
counties or portions of large metropolitan areas, although
a few PSUs include adjacent counties. There were 98 PSUs
in NHANES III. In our data set, each PSU contained, on
average, 110 participants (range, 1­236). To adjust for PSU
in the regression analyses, we included a separate dummy
variable for each PSU. All p values were two-sided and
were considered statistically significant if they were less
than 0.05.
We also assessed the associations between total dietary
selenium intake and race and region, as well as the associ-
ation between serum selenium concentration and selenium
intake. Kernel density smoothing (40), weighted by the ap-
propriate NHANES III sample weights, was used to graph
the race-specific distributions of serum selenium concentra-
tion. For purposes of graphic presentation, the selenium
range was restricted to 70­200 ng/ml.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the study population, weighted to rep-
resent the US noninstitutionalized population, are presented
in table 1. Whites had a higher male:female ratio and were
older than Blacks. The majority of Blacks lived in the South,
whereas Whites were more evenly dispersed throughout the
regions. Blacks more often reported living in poverty rela-
tive to Whites.
Population density estimates (figures 1 and 2) illustrate
that, for both sexes, serum selenium concentrations were
noticeably shifted to lower concentrations in Blacks relative
to Whites. This pattern was observed across most of the
United States, as illustrated in figure 3, which includes un-
adjusted mean values for Blacks and Whites in each of the
67 PSUs that contained at least 10 members of each race.
Mean values are plotted on the x-axis for Blacks and on the
y-axis for Whites. The points for a majority (93 percent) of
PSUs fall above a 45° line, indicating that Whites have
higher mean serum selenium concentrations than Blacks
in most of the PSUs. This figure also shows a strong positive
correlation (q ¼ 0.74, p < 0.0001) between the Black and
White serum selenium levels in the various PSUs.
Prior to constructing statistical models to examine the
association between serum selenium and race, we assessed
the association between serum selenium and potential con-
founders. Age, sex, current smoking status, body mass
index, PIR, region of residence, and current alcohol con-
sumption were found to significantly predict serum sele-
nium levels when entered into a model one at a time (p <
0.05). In the fully adjusted model that included PSU but not
region, all of these variables remained significantly associ-
ated with serum selenium concentration, with the exception
of current alcohol consumption (p ¼ 0.44) and PIR (p ¼
0.22).

0.0001) (table 2). In age-adjusted models and in models
adjusted for all of these factors except region of residence,
the racial differences diminished progressively but remained
statistically significant (p < 0.0001) for both sexes (table 2).
The influence of geographic location of residence was
evaluated by first incorporating into the models region of
residence (Northeast, Midwest, South, or West). Then we
replaced region with PSU to more finely adjust for the
geographic location of residence. For both sexes, the

Black/White difference was moderately diminished with the
addition of region of residence (table 2). The substitution of
PSU approximately halved the crude Black/White differ-
ence, but mean serum selenium concentration remained sig-
nificantly lower in Blacks than in Whites in all models and
for both sexes.
Using total dietary intake of selenium from the NHANES
III 24-hour recall, we examined racial differences in re-
ported selenium intake and evaluated the association be-
tween serum selenium concentration and selenium intake.
For these analyses, 291 additional participants were ex-
cluded because of missing values for selenium intake, leav-
ing 10,488 participants. Although selenium intake was
higher among Whites (120.81 lg/day) than among Blacks
(118.27 lg/day), this difference did not achieve statistical
significance in either the crude model or the fully adjusted
model that included PSU (p > 0.05). Dietary selenium was
also not associated with serum selenium in the crude models
or in the models fully adjusted for all selenium predictors,
including PSU, nor was it associated with region of resi-
dence in the crude or fully adjusted (but without PSU)
models (p > 0.05).
DISCUSSION
Selenium has been hypothesized to play a role in prevent-
ing cancer (1­3). Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated
an inverse association between circulating selenium levels
and cancers of the prostate (12, 16), lung (14), and colorectum
(13, 15). To date, the strongest evidence for a protective ef-
fect comes from the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial,
a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to
test the ability of selenium supplements (200 lg/day) to re-
duce skin cancer incidence among 1,312 males and females
living in a US region with low soil levels of selenium (5, 7,
8, 41­43). With respect to the skin cancer hypothesis, recent
analyses suggest that selenium supplementation actually in-
creases the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer, particularly
squamous cell carcinoma, among participants with higher
baseline serum selenium levels (44). However, secondary
analyses showed reductions in risk of other cancers, espe-
cially prostate cancer; after approximately 4.5 years of treat-
ment and 7.5 years of follow-up, prostate cancer incidence
among persons receiving selenium supplements was half
that experienced by the placebo group (p < 0.05). The Se-
lenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT),
another large-scale randomized, placebo-controlled clinical
trial, recruited approximately 35,500 North American
males, approximately 15 percent of whom are Black. This
trial is designed to determine whether supplemental sele-
nium and/or vitamin E decreases the risk of prostate cancer
in healthy males and is expected to yield results by 2013
(45, 46).
The mechanisms by which selenium may decrease cancer
risk were summarized by Rayman (47). Traditionally, it has
been thought that the capacity of the selenoenzyme gluta-
thione peroxidase to inactivate peroxides that can cause
cellular damage may explain the importance of selenium
in human carcinogenesis. However, glutathione peroxidase
activity is maximized at an intake of 55 lg/day, far below
both the average plasma selenium levels in the United States
and the 200 lg/day given in the Nutritional Prevention of
Cancer Trial (41). A role in oxidant defense for a second
selenoprotein, selenoprotein-P, has been suggested (48).
However, a human supplementation trial demonstrated that
selenoprotein-P levels did not increase after 16 weeks of se-
lenium supplementation at levels of 200 lg/day, 400 lg/day,
and 600 lg/day, indicating that selenoprotein-P was opti-
mized in selenium-replete persons (49).
A third potential cancer prevention agent is selenium-
methylselenocysteine, which has been shown to have
low toxicity and to be the most effective seleno- compound
in the prevention of mammary cancer in rats; selenium-
methylselenocysteine is the predominant form of selenium
in selenium-enriched broccoli and garlic (3, 50­52). Ip et al.
(53) reported on studies showing that methylseleninic acid,
a simplified version of selenium-methylselenocysteine
(without the amino acid), inhibited cell proliferation and
induced apoptosis in a mouse mammary model.
If selenium does reduce cancer risk, racial differences in
circulating selenium levels might partially explain why can-
cer incidence rates are higher among US Blacks than among
US Whites. Compared with White men, age-standardized
incidence rates among Black men are substantially higher
for the three most commonly diagnosed cancers (lung, co-
lon, and prostate); particularly striking is the fact that pros-
tate cancer incidence rates are 61 percent higher in Black
men (17). Cancers of the colorectum and lung/bronchus are
24 percent and 8 percent higher in Black women than in
White women, respectively, but breast cancer incidence is
lower (by 15 percent) in Black women compared with White
women (17).
In our analysis of approximately 11,000 male and female
NHANES III participants aged 12 years or older, Blacks had
mean serum selenium values that were approximately 6 per-
cent lower than those of Whites. Adjustment for lifestyle
factors identified in the literature to be predictors of sele-
nium status only slightly attenuated this racial disparity.
Geography, an indicator of local food and water supplies,
was a strong predictor. Adjustment for broad regional loca-
tion of residence (Northeast, Midwest, South, or West) sig-
nificantly reduced racial disparity. Additional adjustment by
the NHANES III sampling variable, PSU, which more finely
adjusts for geography at approximately the county level,
reduced the crude Black/White disparity in mean serum
selenium concentration by approximately half. Besides ad-
justing for possible geographic differences in the selenium
content of foods, PSU also adjusts for the month/season of
the year in which the serum samples were taken, since most
subjects from the same PSU were examined within a few
weeks of each other. Adjusting for geography may also
control for unmeasured, locally determined lifestyle varia-
bles that are related to both race and serum selenium level
(e.g., local cultural and social differences that relate to di-
etary patterns) (54).
Racial variation in selenium status has been reported pre-
viously (18, 19, 55­58). Apart from the previous NHANES
III analysis that presented unadjusted serum selenium values
by race and other demographic factors (18), other studies
examining racial differences in selenium status have been

limited by the inclusion of relatively few Blacks; most have
reported blood selenium concentrations that were 5­10
percent lower in Blacks than in Whites (19, 56­58).
An explanation for the racial disparities observed in this
analysis is not readily apparent. Selenium intake, based on
the NHANES III 24-hour dietary recall, was slightly higher
among Whites than among Blacks, but this difference did
not achieve statistical significance. Lewis et al. (33) found
no racial differences in selenium intake in a sample of ap-
proximately 250 southern US Blacks and Whites. It is pos-
sible that we were not able to demonstrate that differential
intake of selenium-rich foods plays an important role in
racial variation of serum selenium concentration because
intakes were derived from a single 24-hour dietary recall,
which probably contained significant measurement error.
Thus, dietary influences cannot be ruled out and should be
investigated in future studies. Differential intake of sele-
nium-containing dietary supplements may also be relevant,
although Niskar et al. (18) found that only 11 percent of
NHANES III participants reported taking such supplements;
furthermore, this behavior was not a predictor of serum
selenium concentrations. Although we adjusted for the po-
tentially confounding effect of many known and suspected
predictors of serum selenium, it is possible that an unknown
factor could explain the variation. Finally, genetic factors
that may correlate with race could differentially affect sele-
nium absorption and metabolism and thus serum selenium
bioavailability/concentration (47, 59).
While the absolute difference between racial groups is
relatively small, it may nonetheless be of public health sig-
nificance. An earlier NHANES III analysis indicated that the
US population does not appear to be at risk of selenium
deficiency or toxicity (24). Our analysis also revealed that
nearly all (>99.5 percent) of our study population had se-
rum selenium concentrations that were considered nutrition-
ally optimal (>80 ng/ml) (60). However, selenium levels
that do not produce signs of clinical deficiency could be
suboptimal and could adversely affect cancer risk (1, 5­8).
For example, updated reports from the Nutritional Preven-
tion of Cancer Trial (5, 7, 8, 43) indicate that only partic-
ipants entering the trial with baseline serum selenium levels
below either approximately 106 ng/ml or approximately 120
ng/ml experienced a protective effect from selenium supple-
mentation. Participants with higher baseline values showed
no benefit from supplementation, and some subanalyses
even indicated increased cancer risk among such selenium-
replete persons, suggesting the existence of a threshold level
of benefit and perhaps safety (47). Among our subjects,
a larger proportion of Blacks (56 percent) than of Whites
(36 percent) had serum selenium concentrations below
120 ng/ml (p < 0.0001).
Our study had several strengths and limitations. The un-
usually large number of participants drawn from a represen-
tative sample of noninstitutionalized US Blacks and Whites
enabled us to generate stable and generalizable estimates of
mean serum selenium concentration. Additionally, many
lifestyle factors known to predict serum selenium levels
were measured in NHANES III, allowing us to adjust for
their potentially confounding influences. In particular, be-
cause of the geographically clustered sample design of
NHANES III, we had the rare opportunity to adjust for lo-
cation of residence at approximately the county level. Lim-
itations include the potential misclassification that may
result from the use of a single measurement of serum se-
lenium. However, it has been demonstrated that a single
measurement can reasonably rank subjects according to
long-term dietary intake of selenium (61). We also had to
rely on a single 24-hour recall to estimate dietary intake of
selenium. This method of dietary assessment is known to
have large day-to-day within-person variability, which re-
sults in attenuated associations and reduced statistical power
(62). Additionally, the use of standard recipe and food com-
position databases adds to the measurement error in deter-
mining selenium intake from dietary instruments such as
a 24-hour dietary recall (62). In addition to potential validity
issues regarding the instrument itself, the measurement of
dietary selenium is known to be challenging, because the
selenium content in food varies according to the selenium
content of the soil where the food originated (4). We were
also unable to evaluate certain subtleties related to selenium
intake, such as the fact that different sources of selenium
(e.g., plant sources vs. animal sources) vary in physiologic
relevance and also result in different serum selenium
concentrations (63).
In conclusion, using nationally representative data from
NHANES III, we observed substantial variation in circulat-
ing selenium levels in Black men and women versus White
men and women. Crude and adjusted mean serum selenium
concentrations were significantly lower among Blacks than
among Whites, with differences being apparent for both
sexes. Low intake of selenium has been suggested as a po-
tential risk factor for several major cancers. It is provocative
that, relative to US Whites, US Blacks have both lower
concentrations of serum selenium and higher incidence rates
of cancer overall and cancers of the prostate, colorectum,
and lung. Particularly intriguing are the high prostate cancer
incidence rates observed among Blacks and the relatively
strong evidence for an inverse association between prostate
cancer and selenium exposure. Although the absolute dif-
ference in serum selenium concentrations between Blacks
and Whites was small, this observation deserves further in-
vestigation, since it could potentially translate into a cancer
prevention strategy.
