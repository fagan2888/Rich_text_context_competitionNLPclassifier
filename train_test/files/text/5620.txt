Introduction
Crohn's perianal fistulas are frequently complex,
with patients suffering from reduced quality of
life.1 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the
gold standard2 for fistula imaging, with scans
informing clinicians about fistula complexity: the
morphology of the tracts; presence of extensions/
sepsis, and the relation to the anal sphincter.
Longitudinally, it is used to assess a patient's
response to treatment. The disease process itself
is frequently refractory, with high recurrence and
reoperation rates.3­5 A vicious cycle often ensues
due to the combination of a recurrent inflamma-
tory process and distortion of the anorectum from
scar tissue following each operative procedure.

Abstract
Background: Perianal fistula is a topic both hard to understand and to teach. The key
to understanding the treatment options and the likely success is deciphering the exact
morphology of the tract(s) and the amount of sphincter involved. Our aim was to explore
alternative platforms better to understand complex perianal fistulas through three-
dimensional (3D) imaging and reconstruction.
Methods: Digital imaging and communications in medicine images of spectral attenuated
inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences were imported onto
validated open-source segmentation software. A specialist consultant gastrointestinal
radiologist performed segmentation of the fistula, internal and external sphincter. Segmented
files were exported as stereolithography files. Cura (Ultimaker Cura 3.0.4) was used to
prepare the files for printing on an Ultimaker 3 Extended 3D printer. Animations were created
in collaboration with Touch SurgeryTM.
Results: Three examples of 3D printed models demonstrating complex perianal fistula were
created. The anatomical components are displayed in different colours: red: fistula tract;
green: external anal sphincter and levator plate; blue: internal anal sphincter and rectum.
One of the models was created to be split in half, to display the internal opening and allow
complexity in the intersphincteric space to better evaluated. An animation of MRI fistulography
of a trans-sphincteric fistula tract with a cephalad extension in the intersphincteric space was
also created.
Conclusion: MRI is the reference standard for assessment of perianal fistula, defining
anatomy and guiding surgery. However, communication of findings between radiologist and
surgeon remains challenging. Feasibility of 3D reconstructions of complex perianal fistula is
realized, with the potential to improve surgical planning, communication with patients, and
augment training.

Despite improvements in fistula imaging and
increasing use of additional scan techniques and
contrast, conceptualization of the fistula can be
difficult. Understanding of complex fistula anat-
omy by surgeons is sometimes mediated through
interactions with radiologists, either informally
or through multidisciplinary meetings, but may
still prove challenging. Also, not all surgeons
review imaging with radiologists; it is not always
possible in environments such as busy clinics or
in theatre, where better methods than written
reports are needed to convey satisfactory under-
standing for surgery. Explaining fistula anatomy
and options for surgery to patients amplifies
these challenges further, which impact their abil-
ity to make management decisions.
There has been an influx of novel techniques to
treat perianal fistulas6 of which video-assisted
anal fistula treatment (VAAFT) is one. A recent
meta-analysis found that mean operative time
was 42 ± 14.2 min, that the internal opening was
identified in 85.7% of patients, and that recur-
rence occurred in 112 (14.2%) patients after a
median follow up of 9 months.7 However, this
underestimated the complexity encountered in
Crohn's fistulas, as only 13 of the 788 patients
included in the meta-analysis had Crohn's dis-
ease, and these findings need to be interpreted
with caution. It is the first of the novel procedures
that combines a diagnostic phase with interven-
tion and highlights the surgeon's desire for the
operator to obtain a perioperative mechanism to
understand tract morphology. The technique
uses a rigid endoscope of fixed diameter, which
makes visualization difficult in some cases and
impossible in others, particularly in complex
Crohn's fistula or curved tracts. Whilst the tech-
nique is not used worldwide, the authors of this
paper have found the technique particularly use-
ful in complex Crohn's perianal fistula.8
Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions offer no
new information to the two-dimensional 2D
image but act to improve conceptualization,
whereby a multitude of 2D pictures/slices, sepa-
rated by a predetermined slice thickness, are
`stacked' upon each other to create a 3D repre-
sentation.9 The 3D imaging provides a more real-
istic representation of anatomy, based on
cross-sectional data that has been shown to be a
useful aid for patient education, clinical commu-
nication10 and surgical planning.11 The optimum
medium of 3D reconstruction with reference to
improving communication and understanding
may vary according to the target audience, which
may be an expert (consultant surgeon), interme-
diate (trainee or medical student) or novice (lay
public/patient). The St Mark's IBD patient panel,
when shown previous 3D reconstructions by our
institution,12,13 suggested 3D printing as a viable
alternative. All media require further evaluation
not only for acceptability and efficacy, but also
resource use (availability of the necessary tech-
nology, cost and time).
We postulate that a physical representation of the
fistula will further improve patient and surgeon
understanding (or at least facilitate acquisition of
understanding), and also that a `virtual VAAFT' or
MRI fistulography may help surgeons approaching
the fistula in theatre with a probe or VAAFT scope.
We have therefore developed these two further
innovations for subsequent assessment. We
describe the feasibility of creating 3D-printed fis-
tula models and MRI fistulography.
Material and methods
Ethical approval
After consultation with the local research and
development (R and D) department (London
North West NHS Trust), it was advised that
approval by a National Health Service (NHS)
research ethics committee or the R and D depart-
ment was deemed unnecessary owing to the non-
patient identifiable retrospective nature of this
feasibility study. The study received departmental
approval by the research lead of St Mark's
Hospital, London, United Kingdom.
Magnetic resonance imaging technique
Standard T2-weighted spectral attenuated inver-
sion recovery MRI sequences were acquired in
axial (Repetition time [TR] 8000; Echo Time
[TE] 96; thickness 4 mm; gap 0.2 mm; Field-of-
View [FOV] 240 mm; averages 4, flip angle 150,
bandwidth 130Hz/Pixel [PX]) and coronal (TR
8860; TE 89; thickness 4 mm; gap 0.2 mm; FOV
250 mm; averages 4; flip angle 150, bandwidth
130Hz/PX) planes, with a sagittal T2-weighted
BLADE sequence (TR 5400; TE 100; thickness 3
mm; gap 0.9 mm; FOV 290 mm; averages 1; flip
angle 150, bandwidth 362Hz/PX; BLADE cover-
age 200%).

Segmentation
Digital imaging and communications in medi-
cine files of the MRI sequences were generated
from picture archiving and communication sys-
tem and these were segmented and smoothed
using validated open-source software.14,15 A
specialist consultant gastrointestinal radiologist
manually segmented the following structures
using axial sequences: fistula tract; internal
sphincter; external sphincters/levator plate; and
rectum.
The segmented files were exported as stereo-
lithography files. We used Cura (Ultimaker Cura
3.0.4, Ultimaker B.V., 4191 PN Geldermalsen,
The Netherlands) to prepare the files for printing
on an Ultimaker 3 Extended 3D printer.
Animations were created in collaboration with
Touch SurgeryTM.
Results
Three-dimensional printing
Segment scans and 2D axial MRI scans for three
patients detailing the fistula complex are shown
in Figure 1. The various anatomical compo-
nents are displayed in different colours (red: fis-
tula tract; green: external anal sphincter (EAS)
and levator plate; blue: internal anal sphincter
(IAS) and rectum). Segmentation of patient
images took approximately 15 min per case. A
further 10 min was required for smoothing and
uploading the images to the 3D printer. Each of
the models took approximately 60 min to make.
Figure 2 shows various orientations of the 3D
models for the same patients: (1) A transphinc-
teric fistula (black arrow) with a small blind-
ending cavity (white arrow) beneath the levator
plate; (2) a transphincteric fistula with the right
tract (black arrow) passing through the ischioa-
nal fossa and the left tract (double black arrow)
being blind-ending, connected via a posterior
horseshoe (triple black arrow); (3) these images
show a right-sided transphincteric fistula (black
arrow) with a blind-ending cranial extension
below the levator (double black arrow), and a
short left-sided intersphincteric fistula (white
arrow). Internal openings of the right transphinc-
teric fistula (double white arrow) and left inter-
sphincteric fistula (triple white arrow) are shown
on the internal views of the composite model. Of
note, the final 3D model has been created so it
can come apart to demonstrate the internal
opening and complexity in the intersphincteric
space.

Magnetic resonance fistulography
An animation demonstrating a trans-sphincteric
fistula with a cephalad extension in the intersphinc-
teric space is shown in Figure 3 using the same
colour code as Figure 1. In the animation clip,
which is in the form of a `fly through' akin to vir-
tual colonoscopy, the viewer travels through the
fistula tract and is oriented by annotations as they
pass through specific sphincter structures.
Discussion
Conventional 2D pelvic MRI is the imaging modal-
ity of choice to demonstrate fistula anatomy in anal
fistula16 and has been shown to reduce recurrence by
up to 75%17 when used to guide surgery.18 The
innovations described in this paper are derived from
conventional MRI and do not provide any additional
anatomical information or require additional
sequences, but they do change the medium by which
this information is communicated. MRI fistulogra-
phy and 3D printing represent further attempts to
improve a surgeon's understanding of information
from the MRI, but could also have similar benefits in
the explanation to patients and trainees.
Our MRI parameters are standard compared to
other institutions,19,20 allowing for ease of adop-
tion of the technique to other centres. A slice
thickness of 4 mm provides satisfactory contrast
between different components of the anal canal
and the fistula with good signal-to-noise ratio.
Additionally, there are fewer slices through the
anal canal, reducing time taken to segment the
fistula and anal canal. With technology advancing
rapidly, these innovations represent the first step
to automated segmentation techniques that have
been described in other specialties,21­23 including
abdominal MRI of Crohn's patients,24 and could
become the standard of care for perianal fistulas.

For surgeons, a 3D model can potentially aid
understanding of the complex relationship
between sphincter anatomy and fistula, guiding
surgical decisions and improving outcomes. Our
initial experience was of `whole' printed models,
which allowed for an overall appreciation of the
anatomy, but had similar benefits to 3D images.
As our experience grew, we sought to deliver visu-
alization of intersphincteric complexity and iden-
tification of key anatomical landmarks such as the
internal opening, through the creation of com-
posite fistula models that can be separated (as in
the final panel of Figure 2) to highlight internal
structures. The 3D-printed models represent a
`concrete' step toward personalized medicine.25
Whilst the technique offers an intuitive benefit,
clinical utility maybe difficult to ascertain. Any
effect is likely to be harder to demonstrate
amongst `experts' but may have benefit to those
surgeons with less experience and as such, we
envisage the junior trainee may benefit the most.
In Crohn's perianal fistula, the underlying disease
process can be unforgiving, and sustained remis-
sion can only be achieved in 26­50%.26 Two of the
key objectives in reducing recurrence are to iden-
tify correctly and treat all secondary extensions and
drain any collections/abscesses.27 VAAFT is a
recent innovation that aims to address both
objectives.28 Criticisms of the technique are that
the rigid scope limits manoeuvrability and as with
any technique, it carries an associated new expense
and a learning curve. MR fistulography would
facilitate novices in the `diagnostic' phase to iden-
tify/negotiate tracts with the potential to limit over-
all operative time, whilst providing a `road map'
for more challenging fistulas, aiding identification
of secondary extensions which might otherwise be
missed and lead to inevitable recurrence. And of
course, the same benefit would apply to other
reparative techniques performed with a clearer
understanding of the tract anatomy.
The patient­clinician relationship centres around
shared decision making, with the clinician offer-
ing options with their associated risks and bene-
fits, and patients deciding which options are most
appropriate to their own symptoms and goals. A
variety of factors including the patient's prior
understanding and the clinician's interpersonal
skills, as well as the complexity of the decision
and a balance of the patient's ability to under-
stand and the clinician's ability to explain, govern
the success of this decision-making process. Some
of these factors are not modifiable but clinicians
can improve their delivery of information, includ-
ing using adjuncts. When the complexity is related
to anatomical understanding, 3D models provide
a theoretical advantage. An example of this ben-
efit was demonstrated in a recent study on con-
genital heart defects, which quantified the benefit
of 3D models in facilitating communication with
patients.29 The study also demonstrated patients'
enthusiasm for the technique, with over three
quarters of the study participants asking to keep
the models. Further work is needed to confirm
this in patients with perianal Crohn's fistula, par-
ticularly in facilitating informed consent.
Another potential benefit is in medical education.
Due to the complexity of tracts and their relation-
ship with the anal sphincter, perianal fistulas are
an example of a topic that is not only hard to
understand but also hard to teach. Such topics
lend themselves to 3D reconstruction very well.
Much of the key to understanding the treatment
options, difficulties, and likely success of surgery
is in deciphering the exact morphology of the
tract(s) and the amount of sphincter involved. If
the trainee does not understand the fistula, they
cannot plan surgery, consent patients or under-
stand how their consultant does so. We have pre-
viously demonstrated an international appetite

resonance fistulography, a `fly through' of the fistula

for 3D reconstructions at an international confer-
ence at which 85% of respondents expect 3D
modelling to be useful for perianal fistula surgery
and 88% would use 3D modelling if available.30
The precise metric needed to demonstrate clini-
cal utility is part of future work. We postulate that
the metric will be stakeholder (surgeon: generalist
versus specialist, trainee, patient) and time spe-
cific (pre-, peri-, postoperatively, such as in
describing the nature of a case to a lay audience as
part of a medico-legal proceeding).
The aim of this feasibility study was to prove the
concept and develop experience in producing 3D
imaging, 3D models and MRI fistulography.
There are several limitations of this proof-of-con-
cept study. Firstly, expertise is required to create
the 3D images, models and fistulography. The
accuracy of the segmentation of the fistula and
the sphincter complex is dependent on the radi-
ologist, but the technique is generalizable and
uses open-source software. The use of 3D print-
ing is increasingly widespread, and institutions in
which a need exists for such models are often
affiliated with universities and can be granted
access to 3D printers. An additional resource
consideration is cost (printer and materials) and
as such, one may choose to limit such techniques
to complex or refractory cases. Future improve-
ments in clinical applicability, in terms of raw
materials to print with, speed of printing and
reduced costs, are likely to make 3D printing
more widespread.31 Ultimately, the benefit of
these techniques in patient understanding, train-
ing of junior surgeons and communication
between radiologist and surgeon, needs to be
demonstrated in further work, underway at our
institution.
Conclusion
MRI fistulography and 3D-printed models have
been developed with specific functions in mind.
We suggest that 3D-printed models will offer a
medium to enhance the education of trainees and
a useful adjunct for communication with patients.
MRI fistulography is a concept that has been
derived from the success of virtual colonoscopy
and offers the operating surgeon a realistic road
map to follow. Both of these innovative tech-
niques offer intuitive advantages to surgeons,
trainees and patients but the effect of these needs
objective assessment.
