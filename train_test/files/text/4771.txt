Introduction
Creative ideas, as a starting point of any innovation endeavor,
play a crucial role for companies who seek competitive
advantages in a turbulent marketplace (Cox & Blake, 1991).
This is especially true for the companies operating in mobile
service sectors and related business. In this article, mobile
service is used as an umbrella term to refer to mobile apps,
mobile software-as-a-service, hardware, and any combina-
tions of them. Several changes occurred in the mobile ser-
vice market since the Apple App Store, the Google Play
store, and the Nokia Ovi store started opening in 2007 (Lane
et al., 2010). These platforms have revolutionized the con-
cept of the mobile phone, hosting the release of new content
every day. Nowadays, the majority of mobile devices require
services such as voice and data services, SMS (Short Message
Service), video streaming, location-based services, and so
forth. For the companies in this arena, one key question they
need to constantly answer is, "Where are the ideas for the
next leading mobile services coming from?"
Innovative ideas can come from both inside and outside a
company. Companies that utilize external actors and sources
in their idea generation processes tend to be more innovative
(Laursen & Salter, 2006). Research into the relationship
between customer and product innovation maintains that
existing customers are often considered a valuable source of
creativity and innovation (von Hippel, 1986). The "voice of
customer" needs to be heard (Laursen & Salter, 2006).
Listening to the voices of customers and observing their
behaviors may provide valuable data on unsatisfied needs
and point to creative solutions to existing problems. However,
for high-technology industries such as mobile technology, it
has been argued that ordinary customers are not a good
source for new ideas because "real-world experience of ordi-
nary users is often rendered obsolete by the time a product is
developed or during the time of its projected commercial
lifetime" (von Hippel, 1986, p. 796). The widely used term
lead users--those users who face needs that will be general

In Need of Creative Mobile Service Ideas?
Forget Adults and Ask Young Children

Abstract
It is well acknowledged that innovation is a key success factor in the mobile service domain. Having creative ideas is the first
critical step in the innovation process. Many studies suggest that customers are a valuable source of creative ideas. However,
the literature also shows that adults may be constrained by existing technology frames, which are known to hinder creativity.
Instead young children (aged 7-12) are considered digital natives yet are free from existing technology frames. This led us to
study them as a potential source for creative mobile service ideas. A set of 41,000 mobile ideas obtained from a research
project in 2006 granted us a unique opportunity to study the mobile service ideas from young children. We randomly
selected two samples of ideas (N = 400 each); one contained the ideas from young children, the other from adults (aged
17-50). These ideas were evaluated by several evaluators using an existing creativity framework. The results show that the
mobile service ideas from the young children are significantly more original, transformational, implementable, and relevant
than those from the adults. Therefore, this study shows that young children are better sources of novel and quality ideas
than adults in the mobile services domain. This study bears significant contributions to the creativity and innovation research.
It also indicates a new and valuable source for the companies that seek creative ideas for innovative products and services.

in a marketplace several months or years before ordinary
users do--is coined in the same study. Von Hippel (1986)
argued that lead users are in a better position to provide accu-
rate data on future needs; however, they suffer the same con-
straints of ordinary customers posed by their real-world
experience and available technology.
Children, however, are one group of people who suffer
less from the above-mentioned constraints (Druin, 2002),
and a never-ending source of imagination (Scaife & Rogers,
1998). They are less constrained by existing technology
frame due to their little life experience. Still, they somehow
remain as a neglected group by market and innovation
research, perhaps due to the traditional views of the all-
knowing adults and the all-learning children (Druin, 2002).
Children are not considered a lead user group as defined by
von Hippel (1986), and they cannot even be considered as a
customer group due to their lack of purchasing power.
However, the studies conducted before the Internet age hint
that children, especially young children, are more creative
than people from other age groups. Children have been pro-
posed to be part of the processes to design new technologies,
in the roles of informants, design partners, or even leaders
(Druin, 2002, 2010; Read, 2015; Vint, 2005; Yip et al., 2013).
The mobile phone industry might really benefit from this
neglected source of creative ideas.
Research Question: Can young children be a valuable
source of creative mobile service ideas?
This is the research question that our study sets out to
answer. As far as the authors are aware of, there are no other
studies along this line of inquiry. The purpose of this study is
to have a better understanding of the voices of young chil-
dren in terms of creative mobile service ideas. To this end,
two sets of mobile service ideas randomly sampled from a
larger survey conducted in 2006 were analyzed. One set con-
tained 400 unique ideas expressed by a group of young chil-
dren of 7 to 12 years old. The other set included 400
distinctive ideas from a group of adults aged from 17 to 50
years. These ideas were analyzed using a conceptual frame-
work of creativity derived from the literature, in which cre-
ativity is conceptualized as a compound concept with two
dimensions: novelty and quality. Both dimensions have two
associated constructs: originality and paradigm relatedness
for the novelty dimension, and relevance and workability for
quality (Dean, Hender, Rodgers, & Santanen, 2006). We
tested the difference between the two samples along the
above-mentioned dimensions and constructs. The findings of
our study empirically demonstrate that young children are
actually a valuable source to derive novel ideas that are also
of high quality. In contrast, the adults'ideas are deemed to be
less novel and of lower quality.
The remaining part of the article is organized as follows.
This section continues with laying out the background and
related work. The concept of creativity is investigated in the
Conceptualization of Creative Ideas subsection. The research
approach is described in the Materials and Method section.
Then the Results section reports the obtained outcomes of
the study, which are further discussed in the light of relevant
studies in the Discussion section. The limitations of the study
are reflected on in the same section. The last section con-
cludes the article and outlines future work.
Mobile Services
According to Alahuhta (2011), mobile services are "radio
communications services between mobile devices while in
motion or between such stations and fixed points of services
(computer systems/servers)" (p. 76). The architecture of
mobile service systems can be decomposed into three com-
ponents: (a) wireless communication infrastructure, (b)
mobile terminals, and (c) mobile (content) services and apps.
The majority of mobile services and apps rely on cellular
networks. Although many apps function in offline mode,
nowadays users have to be online to benefit from most
mobile services.
For end users, the most concrete embodiment of mobile
services is the mobile device itself. Within a decade, a great
development has occurred in mobile devices. This develop-
ment is mainly due to the miniaturization and an increasing
level of integration of electronic devices. After the introduc-
tion of physical full keyboards to business-oriented mobile
phones, the product line has greatly developed in terms of the
number of cellular bands, the quality of display, the amount
of memory and storage, the variety of data access methods,
the capabilities of running mobile applications, and the num-
ber of features. Desoli and Filippi (2006) presented the evo-
lution of mobile terminals and stated that new upcoming
modular devices could satisfy increasing user demand. The
size and weight of mobile devices have decreased steadily
until the introduction of touch-based smartphones where,
due to the new interaction method and improved user experi-
ence, the displays have become larger than earlier. The first
iPhone sale on June 29, 2007, is a watershed of mobile termi-
nals and the boom of the smartphone era. Additional File 1
(in the online appendix) is a portrait of the technological evo-
lution of mobile terminals using typical phones of the year as
examples.
Mobile content services and apps can be classified in dif-
ferent ways. Alahuhta, Abrahamsson, and Nummiaho (2008)
suggested a list of categories from an end-user perspective,
including information pull and push, service request, locat-
ing persons, objects, identification, and so forth. The full list
of categories and descriptions can be seen in Table 1.
Until 2009, the distribution of mobile content services
and apps used to be controlled either by device manufactur-
ers or traditional telecom operators. In July 2008, Apple
launched the App Store to promote mobile applications for
the iPhone and iPod mobile handsets. Similarly, Google
launched its own store for applications running the Android
Kuzmickaja et al. 3
operating system in October 2008. These are the two most
popular and well-known application stores. The application
stores attempt to integrate applications closely with devices,
so that application downloading is simple and easy and the
user experience is optimized (Alahuhta, 2011).
Source of Creative Ideas
The mobile service domain is highly dynamic and innova-
tion plays a crucial role (Siau & Shen, 2003). Obtaining
creative ideas is the first step toward innovation. McLean
(2005) stated that "without creative ideas [. . .] innovation
is an engine without any fuel," and further elaborated that
"no innovation is possible without the creative processes
that mark the front end of the process: identifying impor-
tant problems and opportunities, gathering information,
generating new ideas, and exploring the validity of those
ideas" (p. 227).
Where do creative ideas come from? Ideas for new prod-
ucts or processes can come from both inside and outside a
company. Laursen and Salter (2006) claimed that companies
who use external actors and sources in their idea generation
processes tend to be more innovative. Customer needs and
consumer trends are often a valuable source of innovation.
Ideas provided by end users can play a major role in the
development of new services. For example, one case study of
banking services showed that the customers of the bank pro-
posed around 40 new functionalities. In comparison, only
seven novel functionalities were proposed by the bank itself
(Oliveira & von Hippel, 2011). Therefore, the "voice of cus-
tomer" needs to be heard (Laursen & Salter, 2006).
However, for novel products characterized by rapid
change such as mobile services, the insights of existing cus-
tomers and users into new product, process, or service needs
and potential solutions are "constrained by their own real-
world experience" (von Hippel, 1986). As a consequence,
customers "steeped in the present" are "unlikely to generate
novel product concepts which conflict with the familiar"
(p. 791), as the familiarity with the attributes and uses of
existing products affect an individual's ability to conceive
novel attributes and uses. It also affects the ability to conceive
new product needs, especially in high-technology industries
(von Hippel, 1986). Von Hippel (1986) coined the term lead
users of a product whose needs will become general in a mar-
ketplace months or years in the future, and who do have real-
life experience with the novel product or process concepts of
interest. They are in a better position than "ordinary" users to
provide new product concept and design data.
However, von Hippel (1986) admitted that the insights of
lead users could be as constrained to the familiarity as those
of other users. Therefore, a natural question to ask is, who
are the group of people that are least constrained by their
own real-world experience and familiarity with existing
technologies? This points our attention to children.
Creativity of children. Several studies investigating creativity
based on a person's age have agreed that children are more
creative than adults, because they explore the world with
"fresh eyes." Instead, rather than producing ideas based on
received new information, adults are eliminating information
to simplify daily routine (Vint, 2005; von Hippel, 1986,
1988). According to Vint (2005), Land and Jarman (1993)
evaluated an individual's creativity over the time. A three-
step research has been conducted: (a) in 1968, a total of
1,600 five-year old children were studied and 98% of them
were evaluated as creative; (b) in 1973, those children were
tested again as they were 10 years old, 30% being creative;
(c) in 1978, a final test was conducted on the same group of
children when they were teenagers (15 years old), and only
12% of them were considered creative. However, the same
study evaluated 280,000 adults and only 2% of them were
considered creative. Therefore, the younger a person is, the
higher the tendency of being creative.
However, how "fresh eyed" are today's children in terms
of information technologies? Today's children have been
characterized as being digital natives, as opposed to their
parents and instructors, who are better considered as digital
immigrants (Prensky, 2001). Recent studies have reported
how high is the amount of digital-based experience that chil-
dren have been exposed to. It has been shown that there is an
increasing use of computers, Internet, videogames, and
mobile devices by children (Subrahmanyam, Greenfield,
Kraut, & Gross, 2001). In particular, it has been shown that
half of the children in 10 U.K. primary schools were already
mobile phone owners before 2004 (Davie, Panting, &
Charlton, 2004). When smartphone is concerned, a recent
research project found that 40% of European boys and 37%
of European girls aged 9 to 12 have a smartphone for private
use (Mascheroni & Ólafsson, 2013).
Would the familiarity with information technologies pre-
vent children from being creative, as it puts constraints on

adults? Not necessarily. For example, Jackson et al. (2012)
investigated children's creativity and information technol-
ogy use, and revealed that a certain correlation existing
between videogame playing and children creativity. Children
have also been proposed to be part of the processes to design
new technologies, in the roles of informants and design part-
ners (Druin, 2002; Scaife & Rogers, 1998), and more recent
work looked into the potential of children leading the process
of design from initial problem formulation to design review
and elaboration (Yip et al., 2013). The possibility and effec-
tiveness of children being expert evaluators using heuristic
evaluation method has also been explored (Salian, Sim, &
Read, 2013). As Read (2015) argued, the motivation for the
involvement of children as active participants and evaluators
has been that there is a considerable distance between chil-
dren and any (adult) expert "guessers," and children act in
ways that could not have been predicted by an expert.
In brief, even though there is a seeming tension between
children having "fresh eyes" (less constrained by existing
technologies) and their being digital natives, evidences in the
literature show that the two may not be in conflict but could
both boost the creativity of children in the domain of infor-
mation technologies. Based on the reviewed literature, we
would expect that, when mobile services are concerned, the
ideas coming from young children should be more creative
than those generated by adults; therefore, young children can
be a valuable source of innovation. In this article, we focus
on the creativity of young children aged from 7 to 12 years.
According to Piaget (1953), this is a homogeneous group in
terms of their intellectual development. Young children in
this age group are able to think abstractly and make rational
judgments about concrete, observable phenomena.
Conceptualization of Creative Ideas
Creativity is a multi-faceted, multi-disciplinary concept that
is difficult to measure (Piffer, 2012). Over hundred defini-
tions exist for creativity, spanning several disciplines
(Hocevar & Bachelor, 1989). According to Sternberg (2006),
a component of creativity is imaginative thinking, that is, the
ability to see things in novel ways, to recognize patterns, and
make connections. Nijstad and Paulus (2003) described cre-
ativity as "the development of original ideas that are useful
or influential." Rhodes (1961) suggested that creativity could
be an attribute of a process, a product, a person or environ-
mental press, so-called four P's model of creativity.
However, Dean et al. (2006) argued that, to define idea
creativity, it was helpful to differentiate it from the concept
of creativity itself. Drawing on MacCrimmon and Wagner
(1994), they defined "a creative idea as a quality idea that is
also novel. That is, it applies to the problem, is an effective
and implementable solution, and is also novel" (p. 649).
Based on a literature review of 51 studies on quality, novel,
and creative ideas, they summarized a conceptual framework
of idea creativity as illustrated in Table 2.
Novelty is considered to be the main dimension of creativ-
ity (Dean et al., 2006). A novel idea is rare, unusual, or
uncommon (Connolly, Dalgleish, Kalverboer, Hopkins, &
Geuze, 1993). According to this definition, the most novel
idea is an idea that is totally unique; conversely, the least
novel idea is the most common one (MacCrimmon &
Wagner, 1994). Dean et al. (2006) warned that when apply-
ing the framework, the novelty of any idea must be judged in
relation to how uncommon it is in the mind of the idea evalu-
ator or how uncommon it is in the overall population of
ideas. Novelty can be broken down into two constructs: orig-
inality and paradigm relatedness. Ideas are considered origi-
nal when they are rare but also have the characteristic of
being ingenious, imaginative, or surprising. Idea originality
ranges from those that are common and mundane to those
that are rare and imaginative. Paradigm relatedness describes
the transformation potential of ideas. It is the degree to which
an idea relates to the currently prevailing paradigm, and it is
closely related to the concepts of transformational and
germinal.
Based on this understanding, we can formulate the fol-
lowing hypotheses regarding the novelty dimension of idea
creativity:
Hypothesis 1 (H1): Mobile service ideas expressed by
young children are more novel than those by adults.
Hypothesis 1a (H1a): Mobile service ideas expressed by
young children are more original than those by adults.
Hypothesis 1b (H1b): Mobile service ideas expressed by
young children are more transformational in terms of
existing paradigm than those by adults.
The second dimension of idea creativity is quality, which
is further divided into workability and relevance. An idea is
workable (or feasible) if it can be easily implemented and
does not violate known constraints. An idea is relevant if it
applies to the stated problem and will be effective at solving
the problem. There is a third construct suggested by Dean
et al. (2006), namely, specificity. An idea is specific if it is
clear and worked out in detail. We excluded the specificity
construct in this study, as Dean et al. (2006) recommended
that specificity was optional and should be measured only
when it is a main focus of a study.
Consequently, we formulate the following hypotheses
regarding the quality dimension of idea creativity:

Hypothesis 2 (H2): Mobile service ideas expressed by
young children are of higher quality than those by adults.
Hypothesis 2a (H2a): Mobile service ideas expressed by
young children are implemented more frequently than
those by adults.
Hypothesis 2b (H2b): Mobile service ideas expressed by
young children are more relevant than those by adults.
Materials and Method
Sample
The research design has relied on a historical data set. In
2006, a group of researchers from theVTTTechnical Research
Centre of Finland launched a national research project called
the Idea Movement (Leikas, 2007). They systematically col-
lected innovative ideas of mobile services from the Finnish
citizens through 31 workshops organized in the country in
that year. The locations of the workshops included universi-
ties, schools, workplaces, and even a shopping center.
The workshops were run in a consistent format, but the
targeting participants were grouped by their ages. Therefore,
the workshops were run separately for children and adults.
Each workshop was kicked off with a short introduction to
scientific process and idea generation techniques, which was
then followed by brainstorming sessions both individually
and in groups. Each participant was asked to produce 20
ideas individually and then to form groups of three to four
people per group. Each group was targeting at generating
100 ideas or more. The researchers acted as the facilitators of
the workshops and encouraged the participants not to think
about the technology, but to express their concrete needs, and
to produce ideas even if they would feel them either "silly"
or not realistic in their minds. The ideas were produced in a
written format. For this reason, the writing ability of young
children did most likely have impact on the extent of how the
ideas were expressed. Regardless, young children wrote
down their ideas independently without the assistance from
the adults present at the workshops.
The ideas were generally one to two sentences in length,
describing a mobile service idea, or expressing a need that
one thinks could be fulfilled utilizing mobile technology.
Two examples of the ideas are as follows:
The camera of the phone would have a recognition feature
which would recognize persons in photos. (Child idea)
A composing service which lets one to inspect song patterns that
are based on different mathematical forms. (Adult idea)
In total, 41,000 ideas were collected from 2,150 partici-
pants, the majority of whom were university students, school
children, and elderly people. Among the total ideas, 1,800
were from young children aged 7 to 12 years, and 25,300
were from adults aged 17 to 50 years.
To decide the meaningful sample sizes for comparing the
ideas of young children and adults, we consulted several
studies in statistics and organizational research. We set a
value of .05 as margin error, as suggested in the guidelines by
Bartlett, Kotrlik, and Higgins (2001) and Krejcie and Morgan
(1969). We adopted the most conservative value for variance
estimation of .50, that is, the one usually found for dichoto-
mous variables and will also produce the maximum sample
size (Bartlett et al., 2001). Subsequently by using the Cochran
(1977) formula for sample size estimation, we calculated that
for a 0.95 confidence level, we needed at least sample size of
N = 384. However, the application of a simplified formula
from Yamane (1967), which took into account the population
size as well, gave us the sample size value N = 395, that is,
any sample size between 384 and 395 was sufficient for our
scope. As a result, we opted to randomly select 400 distinct
ideas from the idea set of young children (7-12 years old) and
400 distinct ideas from that of adults (17-50 years old). Our
two samples can be freely accessed online.1
Idea Creativity Assessment
Two independent raters evaluated the creativity of each idea
in each sample by using the framework described in the pre-
vious section (as shown in Table 2). Both judges were adult
mobile service users and had years of experience with mobile
devices. One of the judges had 6 year experience in mobile
service development and was an early adopter of mobile
devices. The other rater was a researcher on open innovation
and creativity in information systems. Before the rating, the
judges were trained on the definition and understanding of
the idea creativity concept and measurement scales. The
judges were blind to the sources of the ideas, which were
ungrouped and randomized.
Novelty assessment. The two constructs of novelty, original-
ity and paradigm relatedness, were measured with a Likert-
type scale from 1 to 5. A score of 1 was assigned to least
original or least influential. A score of 5 represented the other
extremes. The detailed scale descriptions can be seen in
Table 3. Following the recommendation of Dean et al.
(2006), the novelty score was calculated as the sum of origi-
nality and paradigm relatedness, thus ranging in the interval
[2, 10].
All ideas were generated and collected in 2006. Therefore,
the novelty assessment was challenging for the present study.
To address this issue, we selected two best-selling mobile
phones in 20062: Nokia 16003 (130 million sold; see
Additional File 1 for its main characteristics) and Nokia
60704 (50 million sold). Each rater studied the specifications
of each phone to have a clear presentation of what mobile
functionalities and services were available at that time.
Although Nokia had published smartphones already in 2005
(E61) and in 2006 (N95), they were not in a widespread use
at the time when the data were collected.

Quality assessment. Quality was composed of two constructs:
workability and relevance. In terms of workability, the used
data set granted a unique opportunity to go beyond a simple
speculation. We could investigate if these ideas were actually
implemented after they have been generated in 2006. Any
idea that has been developed, produced, and marketed in at
least some part of the world was considered implemented,
therefore workable. However, ideas that had not been turned
into mobile services or apps at all or that were in develop-
ment but had not been marketed were considered not imple-
mented, therefore not workable. Evaluated in this way, 1/0
dichotomous scores were used. To see whether an idea has
been implemented or not, information on software, hard-
ware, or service that would match the idea was searched
through various online channels. The complete procedure of
the workability assessment that we used is available in Addi-
tional File 2 (in the online appendix).
Relevance was also assessed using the dichotomous
scores, to enable the aggregation to the higher quality dimen-
sion. A score of 1 meant that an idea was a relevant mobile
idea, 0 otherwise. To determine if an idea was a relevant
mobile service idea, we used the category list of mobile ser-
vices (as shown in Table 1). If an idea could be put into the
listed categories, it was considered a relevant idea. Otherwise,
the idea was considered not relevant. It is worth noting that
the ideas that indicate new but un-named types of mobile
service were considered relevant and classified under the cat-
egory "Other mobile service ideas."
The quality score was calculated as the sum of relevance
and workability, within the [0, 2] score range. It is worth
mentioning that, due to the different scales used to measure
novelty and quality, we could not aggregate the novelty and
quality dimensions as a single creativity score in this study.
This is a trade-off we decided to make to benefit from the
historical nature of the data that allowed us to investigate the
actual implementation of these mobile ideas.
Results
This section provides the analysis outcomes of the two ran-
dom samples of 400 ideas generated by young children and
400 ideas by adults. It is organized in two subsections, Idea
Novelty and Idea Quality. Each subsection contains the
descriptive statistics and the hypothesis testing of each cre-
ativity dimension.
Idea Novelty
Additional File 3 (in the online appendix) contains a list of
three most novel ideas from the children and adults samples,
as well as three least novel ideas from the two samples.
Descriptive statistics. Table 4 summarizes the measures of the
novelty dimension and its two constructs, originality and
paradigm relatedness.
Recalling that the score range of the two constructs is [1, 5],
with respect to both originality and paradigm relatedness, the
young children sample presented higher values for the mean
and the average rating of the ideas. In addition, the mean and
the median of the adults sample were less than 3, which is the

children on average were able to provide sufficiently original
and related ideas, whereas the adults could not.

digm relatedness show strong differences between the two
samples. Regarding originality (see Figure 1), the distribu-
tion of the averaged scores of the young children's ideas is
noticeably greater than that of the adults' ideas. The first
quartile of the children's sample--that is, 3--is greater than
the third quartile of the adults' sample--that is, 2.5. In addi-
tion, the children's median value corresponds to the third
quartile value of 3.5 and is greater than the adults' median
value, by 1.5 units. It should be noted that the values of the
outliers in Figures 1 and 2 fall outside 1.5 times the inter-
quartile range and are therefore meaningless in our context.
However, it is interesting to notice that 45 ideas from the
children sample were rated higher than 4 on average whereas
only 2 ideas from the adults sample were rated higher than 4
on average.
For the paradigm relatedness construct in Figure 2, the
distribution of the averaged scores of the children's ideas
appears to be greater than that of the adults' ideas. The first
quartile of the children sample and the third quartile of the
adults sample have the same value of 3.5. The median of
the children's ideas is greater than that of the adults' ideas
by 1 unit.
Recalling the score range [2, 10] for the novelty dimen-
sion, we see in Table 4 that the children's sample outper-
forms the adults'one. The mean and the median values of the
children's sample, both 6.50, are greater than those of the
adults' sample, which are 4.39 and 4.50, respectively. As
shown in the boxplots of Figure 3, the data distribution seems
greater for the children's sample. The first quartile of the
children's sample is equal to the third quartile of the adults'
sample--that is, 5.50.
Hypotheses testing.The hypotheses related to novelty (H1,
H1a, and H1b) were implemented as tests for differences
between groups. A series of Shapiro­Wilk tests on the sam-
ples showed strong evidence for non-normality (p value <
.0001, for the two groups, for all the three hypotheses' test-
ing). Therefore, the hypotheses were tested with a series of
one-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Table 5 summarizes
the tests.
At a .0001 significance level, there was support for H1a
and H1b, which state that the mobile service ideas expressed
by young children are more original and paradigm changing
than those by adults. Finally, at the same significance level,

the results also show the evidence for a higher novelty level
for the children's ideas with respect to the adults' ideas (H1).
Idea Quality
Descriptive statistics. Table 6 summarizes the measures of the
quality dimension and its two constructs, relevance and
workability.
Recalling that the constructs relevance and workability
are binary in the interval [0, 1], the two samples provide sim-
ilar values for the relevance. The mean value was 0.98 for the
children's sample and 0.96 for the adults' one, whereas the
median was 1 for both. Regarding workability, a larger dif-
ference between the children's sample and the adults' one
was observed. Although the median was the same for both
groups--that is, 1.00--the children's sample had an average
value for workability higher by 0.12 units, whereas the dif-
ference in the standard deviations was 0.07. It appeared that
the children's ideas on average are more often implemented
than the adults' ideas. However, no difference in the rele-
vance of the two groups was noticeable.
A total of 393 over 400 ideas (98%) were evaluated as
relevant from the children's sample, whereas 383 over 400
(96%) were considered relevant from the adults' sample.
Thus, the children provided a slightly higher number of rel-
evant ideas, with an increment of 2%.
Out of 400 ideas from the children's sample, a total of 324
(81%) have been developed in the past years. However, from
the 400 adults' ideas, 276 (69%) have been implemented.
Thus, the children sample presented 12% more workable
ideas.
Hypotheses testing.Both relevance and workability con-
structs followed binomial distribution, because their values
represent the number of successes in a sample. Therefore, we
tested the one-tailed hypotheses (H2, H2a, H2b) with a chi-
squared test for proportions of two independent samples. The
proportions to be tested were the ones mentioned in the pre-
vious sub-section. The hypotheses tests are summarized in
Table 7.
With a p value less than .0001, we found significant evi-
dence for the hypothesis that the children's ideas are more
workable than the adults'ideas (H2a). With a p value smaller
than .05, we found significant support for the hypothesis that
the children's ideas are more relevant than the adults' ideas
(H2b). Finally, with a p value smaller than .0001, we found
Figure 2. Boxplots for idea paradigm relatedness.
Kuzmickaja et al. 9
significant evidence to support the hypothesis that the chil-
dren's mobile service ideas have higher quality than the
adults' ones (H2).
Discussion
We hypothesized that the mobile service ideas expressed
by young children aged 7 to 12 years are more novel (H1)
and of higher quality (H2) than those by the adults aged 17
to 50. The results of our study support the two higher level
hypotheses. The general perception suggested by the liter-
ature was that the ideas from children are wilder and less
realistic and therefore less relevant and workable than
those of adults. However, our findings empirically
demonstrate that this may not be the case for the mobile
services domain.
In terms of the two constructs of idea novelty, namely,
originality and paradigm relatedness, our study supports the
two hypotheses H1a and H1b, and provided significant evi-
dence that children's ideas are more original and transforma-
tional in terms of existing paradigm than those by adults.
Therefore, our study supports the creativity literature that
claims that children are more creative than adults (Land &
Jarman, 1993; Vint, 2005) when creative outcomes are con-
cerned. It also provides further evidence that, although
today's young children are increasingly familiar with and
confident in using information technologies, unlike adults,
they could still keep their "fresh eyes" and open minds when
imagining future digital products and services. The reason
behind this could be that young children aged 7 to 12 years
are in the intellectual development phase, and their minds are
still forming and naturally more open than those of adults
(Vint, 2005). However, as it is demonstrated, the "window of
opportunity" closes very quickly and they lose their creativ-
ity dramatically when they grow up. We should either utilize
this source of creativity in time or we need to reflect on and
react accordingly to enable children to preserve or adults to
"re-learn" creativity.

Regarding the two constructs of idea quality, our results
support H2a and found significant evidence that the mobile
service ideas expressed by children are implemented more
frequently, that is, they are more workable. In the study of
Alahuhta et al. (2008), it was claimed that 95% of adults'
ideas could be implemented. Our study found instead that the
percentage of implemented adults' ideas was 69%, which is
26% lower than predicted. We also found significant support
for H2b, which shows that children's ideas are more relevant
than those of adults. The results regarding workability and
relevance are surprising in the sense that the intuitive expec-
tation would be on the contrary. One would think that the
ideas from children are less relevant and workable or at least
there should not be significant difference between the two
age groups.
As part of the relevance analysis, this study classified the
children's ideas using the list of categories from Alahuhta
et al., (2008; as shown in Table 1), and calculated the per-
centages of each category (see Additional File 4 in the online
appendix). We compared the percentages of our analysis of
the children's ideas with that of the adults' ideas presented in
Alahuhta et al. (2008). We found that the category with the
largest percentage in the children's sample was "Other
mobile service ideas" (45.5%), which indicates that the ideas
from children are more difficult to be classified under exist-
ing categories, and therefore, more "out of the box." In com-
parison, the ideas from adults categorized under this category
are 24% of the total adults' ideas analyzed in Alahuhta et al.
(2008).
Limitations of the Study
Several limitations, most of which are related to the samples,
may threaten the validity of our study. First, there was no
detailed demographic data available for the original ideas
collected in 2006. We could not know about the children and
adults behind these ideas more than their ages and that they
are from Finland. This is a threat to generalize our findings to
children and adults of other nations. However, Finland is an
advanced country in terms of mobile technologies; therefore,
it can be argued that its population is a good representative of
current and potential mobile users. In addition, we could not
know exactly how many ideas were generated by the same
persons. However, as the focus of our study is idea creativity
rather than person creativity, the unit analysis is idea, not the
person. Therefore, the lack of the demographic data does not
present a serious threat, even though the availability of this
data would help a better understanding of the generalizabil-
ity of the results to a larger population.
Another limitation is that in this study we did not
include another age group of children from 13 to 16 years
old, which is considered a teenager group. Although their
ideas are also interesting to explore and a comparison
could be made between them and the other two age groups,
the group was excluded from the investigation. The litera-
ture review precisely indicated young children (7-12 years
old) as a very creative group yet the most neglected one,
mostly due to their lack of purchasing power and the tradi-
tional beliefs that relegate adults as "all-knowing" and
young children as "all-learning" (Druin, 2002). Meanwhile,
the creativity of children has been shown to dramatically
decrease when they become teenagers (Land & Jarman,
1993), as cited by Vint (2005). We were mainly interested
in studying the extremely young children as a source of
creative mobile service ideas. For the same reason, we did
not further divide the adult group into more fine-grained
groups. Future studies can build on top of our findings,
including the teenager group or focusing on the compari-
son of children's ideas with those from a sub-group of
adults (e.g., 17-25, 25-35, etc.).

Finally, due to the research design choice, we could not
aggregate novelty and quality scores to a final creativity
score for the evaluated ideas. Therefore, our claim that the
mobile service ideas expressed by young children (7-12
years old) are more creative than those of adults might be
limited. However, the construct of creativity is expressed in
our adopted four sub-hypotheses and measures, which all
were empirically proved to be significantly in favor of young
children.
Conclusion
Innovation is a key success factor in any high-technology
sector, including the mobile service domain. Creative ideas
are the first step of innovative products and services. Existing
customers, especially lead users, are considered the main
sources of creative ideas. However, their creativity is con-
strained by the available technologies and their life experi-
ences. One potential source of creative ideas, which is
somehow overlooked, is young children. This led us to study
young children (aged 7-12) as another potential source for
creative mobile service ideas. Year 2007 saw the introduc-
tion of smartphones, the most significant change to the
mobile service domain. A collection of more than 41,000
mobile ideas collected in 2006 granted us a unique opportu-
nity to study the potential of children as the source of cre-
ative mobile service ideas. To understand if the mobile
service ideas expressed by young children are more creative
than those by adults, we randomly selected two samples
from the idea database of a Finnish research project. One
sample was a collection of ideas from young children aged 7
to 12, and the other from adults (aged 17-50). We evaluated
them using a creativity framework distilled from the litera-
ture. The results showed that the mobile service ideas from
young children are more novel and have higher quality than
those from adults.
The article offers several interesting findings that would
be useful for creativity research as well as mobile service­
providing companies and designers. The theoretical contri-
bution of our study lies in the six hypotheses, which our
study supported significantly. They add to the body of
knowledge of creativity study, especially regarding the idea
creativity of younger age group, that is, the "digital natives."
The practical implication of our study is that it indicates a
new and valuable source for the companies that seek creative
ideas for innovative products and services. Even though the
cost of collecting ideas from young children is yet to be bet-
ter understood, we expect that it should not be more costly
than from the adults as the ideas in our samples were col-
lected in the same manner.
Several future studies can be derived from our study. As
in this study the analysis was at the idea level, future stud-
ies can analyze the creativity at the person level in terms of
mobile service ideas. Future studies can bring in more
angles as well, such as the time of implementation, when
an idea was implemented after it was uttered, and the pop-
ularity of an implemented service, indicated by its down-
load rate.
