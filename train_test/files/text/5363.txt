Abstract
Objective: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sensory motor disorder. RLS an urge to
move the extremities that may be accompanied by dysesthesias, and significantly affects quality of
life of affected patients. The frequency of RLS is higher in different systemic inflammatory diseases.
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an inherited inflammatory disease characterized by attacks of
polyserositis, arthritis, and fever. The prevalence of RLS in patients with FMF is unknown. This
study aimed to evaluate the prevalence rate of RLS in a sample of patients with FMF and compare
this prevalence with that of a matched normal population.
Method: A total of 60 patients with FMF and 60 healthy controls were studied. All participants
underwent a neurological examination. Diagnostic criteria as proposed by the International
Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) were used to define RLS. The IRLSSG rating scale
for the severity of RLS was applied to determine the severity of symptoms.
Results: The prevalence of RLS was not significantly different between patients and controls.
Although the mean International Restless Legs Syndrome Rating Scale (IRLSRS) scores tended to
be higher in patients compared with controls, this difference was not significant. When each item of
the severity scale was compared between the two groups, significantly higher scores were found in
some items of the IRLSRS in patients with FMF compared with controls.
Conclusion: According to this result, RLS symptoms in patients with FMF were more frequent
and lasted longer than those in controls.

Introduction
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common
neurological disorder that significantly affects
quality of life of affected patients.1,2 This
disease is a sensory motor disorder. RLS is
described as an urge to move the extremities
that may be accompanied by dysesthesias,
which is referred to as an unpleasant, abnor-
mal sensation while at rest. Uncomfortable
sensations are relieved by movement and
commonly worsen at night.2 Epidemiological
studies show that RLS occurs in 3%­15% of
the population in adults.2­4
The majority of cases of RLS appear to
be idiopathic in origin (primary RLS).
Secondary cases are encountered in patients
with various neurological and systemic dis-
eases2. RLS occurs with increased frequency
during the course of several systemic inflam-
matory diseases.5­11
Inflammatory diseases of the body are a
group of systemic disorders, which are
characterized by enhanced systemic inflam-
mation and oxidative stress due to a defect
in the innate immune system.12 Familial
Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an inherited
disease that is characterized by attacks of
polyserositis, arthritis, and fever. Recurrent
non-specific inflammation in different joints,
the peritoneum, and pleura causes clinical
symptoms. The prevalence of FMF is high
along the eastern Mediterranean coast and
among the Turkish population.13,14
Although an increased frequency of RLS in
different systemic inflammatory diseases has
been reported, an association between FMF
and RLS has not been investigated. Therefore,
this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence
rate of RLS in a sample of patients with FMF
and compare this prevalence with that of a
matched normal population
Materials and Methods
We studied 60 patients with FMF at
Cumhuriyet Medical University Hospital
from January 2014 to September 2014.
Diagnosis of FMF was made according the
Tel­Hashomer criteria and MEFV gene
analysis (Table 1).15 Healthy age- and sex-
matched control volunteers were recruited
from the general population.
All patients and control subjects underwent
a structured interview on concurrent similar
diseases that cause RLS symptoms. Subjects
with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease,
malignancies, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), sys-
temic lupus erythamotosis (SLE), inflamma-
tory gastrointestinal diseases, malignancies,
and neurological diseases, including multiple
sclerosis, polyneuropathy, and Parkinson's
disease, were excluded from the study.
Patients and controls subjects who were
taking medications that could potentially
interfere with RLS and subjects with alcohol
dependency were not included.
The study was approved by the local
ethics committee. All of the subjects gave
written informed consent according to the
Declaration of Helsinki.

A detailed neurological examination was
performed by a neurologist in all subjects.
This examination included deep tendon
reflexes, pathological reflexes, muscle power,
perception of a pinprick, touch, joint position,
and vibration, and extrapyramidal signs.
Diagnosis of RLS was assessed in
patients and controls according to the four
essential diagnostic criteria established by
the international RLS Study Group. These
criteria were as follows: (1) an urge to move
the legs, usually accompanied or caused by
uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in
the legs; (2) the urge to move or unpleasant
sensations begin or worsen during periods of
rest or inactivity, such as lying or sitting; (3)
the urge to move or unpleasant sensations
are partially or totally relieved by move-
ment, such as walking or stretching, at least
as long as the activity continues, and (4) the
urge to move or unpleasant sensations are
worse in the evening or night than during the
day or only occur in the evening or night.16
All of the subjects who received a positive
diagnosis of RLS were asked to complete the
10-item International Restless Legs
Syndrome Rating Scale (IRLSRS) to assess
the severity of symptoms17. This rating scale
was developed based on questions proposed
by the members of the International RLS
Study Group. Each question had a set of five
response options that were graded from no
RLS or impact (score ¼ 0) to very severe
RLS (score ¼ 4). This produced a total score
that ranged from 0 to 40.
In all of the participants, blood chemistry
parameters, including a full blood count,
measurement of iron, ferritin, glucose, urea,
creatinine, aspartate transaminase, alanine
transaminase, calcium, potassium, magne-
sium, vitamin B 12, and folate levels, and
thyroid hormone profiles were investigated.
Statistical analyses
Data are presented as mean Æ SD. Statistical
analysis was performed with the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences for Windows
(SPSS version 15.0, Chicago, IL, USA).
Comparison of variables between the
groups was performed with the Student's t
test and the Mann­Whitney U test for
numerical variables, and the chi-square test
was used for categorical data. For all com-
parisons, P values less than 0.05 were con-
sidered significant.
Results
In the study group, there were 60 patients
with FMF (47 females and 13 males) and the
mean age was 35.00 Æ 10.50 years. The
control group was composed of 60 healthy
individuals (47 females and 13 males) and
the mean age was 34.81 Æ 7.71 years. The
distribution of age and sex was not different
between the groups.
The diagnosis of RLS was established in
13 (21.7%) patients with FMF and in 10
(16.7%) controls using the RLS question-
naire (Table 2). The prevalence of RLS was
not significantly different between patients
with FMF and control subjects. The mean
IRLSRS score was 24.15 Æ 5.66 in patients

with FMF and RLS and 21.00 Æ 5.66 in
controls with RLS (Table 2). Although the
prevalence of RLS and the mean IRLSRS
scores tended to be higher in patients
compared with controls, these differences
were not significant. Each item of the sever-
ity scale was then compared between the two
groups. Significantly higher scores were
found in items seven and eight of the
IRLSRS in patients with FMF compared
with controls. Item seven rates the frequency
of RLS symptoms and item eight rates the
duration of symptoms. According to this
result, RLS symptoms of patients with FMF
were more frequent and lasted longer than
controls (Table 3).
Blood levels of iron, ferritin, and haemo-
globin, hormone profiles, and blood chem-
istry parameters were not significantly
different between the groups.
Discussion
This study is the first to evaluate the fre-
quency of RLS in patients with FMF. Many
studies have reported an increase in RLS in
several inflammatory diseases, including
RA, SLE, Sjogren syndrome, Behc
¸ et's dis-
ease, and Crohn's disease.8­11,18­20 Reynolds
et al.18 found an increased prevalence of
RLS in patients with RA. Similar findings
were reported by Salih et al., Taylor-Gjevre
et al., and Ishaq et al.19­21 No studies have
reported an interaction between an
increased frequency of RLS and serum
ferritin levels. Hassan et al.9 found that the
prevalence of RLS in patients with SLE was
37.5% compared with 12.5% in control
subjects. An association between RLS and
SLE disease has been reported in a recent
study10. Ediz et al.11 recently reported that
29.4% of patients with Behc
¸ et's disease had
RLS compared with 4.8% of control sub-
jects. These authors evaluated serum iron,
ferritin, and haemoglobin levels, and mean
corpuscular volume in the RLS group. They
did not find any difference in these param-
eters between Behc
¸ et's disease and RLS with
those without RLS.
The exact pathophysiology of RLS
remains unclear. The majority of RLS
cases appear to be idiopathic in origin.
Secondary cases are encountered in various
underlying medical conditions, such as iron
deficiency anaemia, renal failure, and preg-
nancy.2 Approximately 40% of cases of
RLS have a positive family history with
dominant inheritance and several gene loci
related to RLS have been
identified.2,22Although the pathophysio-
logical mechanism underlying this disease
is not completely understood, defective
brain iron metabolism contributes to the
pathogenesis of RLS. The descending dien-
cephalospinal dopaminergic neurons, which
are considered to originate in the A11
neurons of the hypothalamus, are proposed
to play an important role in the pathophysi-
ology of RLS.23
The role of inflammation in RLS has
been suggested by several studies that
showed an increased ratio of small intestinal

bacterial overgrowth.24 Additionally, there
have been several case reports of RLS during
the course of infections, such as human
immunodeficiency virus, Streptococcus,
mycoplasma, hepatitis C, Borrelia, and sys-
temic inflammatory disease, including SLE,
Sjogren's syndrome, and RA.24­26 Previous
studies have shown that hepcidin is a protein
in humans and is an important regulator of
entry of iron into the circulation.24 Expression
of hepcidin is increased in the systemic inflam-
matory state. Upregulation of hepcidin leads
to decreased absorption of iron and may
decrease availability of iron in the central
nervous system.24
Forms of neurological involvement that
may be encountered in FMF or are related
to FMF-related diseases or treatment com-
plications are as follows. Common neuro-
logical manifestations related to FMF are
headaches and muscle pain.27 Creatine
kinase and electromyography results of
patients with FMF are normal in those
with myalgia. However, myopathy has also
been reported in amyloidotic kidney trans-
plant recipients with FMF.28
Central nervous system involvement is
relatively uncommon in FMF compared
with that of the peripheral nervous system.
Various types of seizures, cerebral venous
sinus thrombosis, pseudotumour cerebri,
optic neuritis, central nervous system vascu-
litis associated with systemic vasculitis,
demyelinating lesions, ischaemic stroke,
and recurrent aseptic meningitis have been
reported.27,29­31
The present study showed that the preva-
lence of RLS in patients with FMF was
higher compared with that in controls, but
this difference was not significant. Our study
might have been underpowered regarding
the number of subjects. The IRLSSG sever-
ity scale total score tended to be higher in
patients compared with controls. However,
significantly higher scores were obtained in
some items of the scale in patients with FMF
compared with controls. According to this
result, RLS symptoms were more frequent
and lasted longer in patients with FMF than
in controls.
RLS has a broad worldwide prevalence
between 0.01% and 18.3%.32 The prevalence
of RLS was reported as 3.2% and 9.7% in
different prevalence studies in Turkey, with a
relatively high prevalence in the centre of
Turkey.33­37 The frequency of RLS in our
control group appears to be higher than that
reported previously in prevalence studies in
Turkey.34,35 One reason for this discrepancy
among studies may be the geographical
location of Sivas City. All of the cities in
these previous prevalence studies of RLS
were at a lower altitude than Sivas (altitude
of Sivas is 1285 m). The prevalence of RLS is
greater among individuals who live in areas
with a higher altitude.38
The circadian rhythm of motor restless-
ness and sensory symptoms in RLS and the
association of symptoms with endogenous
melatonin levels suggest that ultraviolet
radiation may be related to RLS expres-
sion32. Our study was conducted in a region
with long-lasting winters, and people trad-
itionally wear concealing clothing. These
factors likely reduced sunlight exposure
and this could affect the frequency of RLS.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to investigate the prevalence of
RLS in patients with FMF. We did not find
an increased frequency of RLS in patients
with FMF. However, results of this pilot
study show that RLS symptoms in patients
with FMF are more frequent and last longer
than those in controls. Further investiga-
tions are needed to examine the potential
effect of severity of symptoms on sleep and
quality of life, and to assess the prevalence
of RLS in a larger number of patients with
FMF.
