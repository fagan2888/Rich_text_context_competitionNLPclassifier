The urban geographical imagination
in the age of Big Data
Taylor Shelton
Abstract
This paper explores the variety of ways that emerging sources of (big) data are being used to re-conceptualize the city,
and how these understandings of what the urban is shapes the design of interventions into it. Drawing on work on the
performativity of economics, this paper uses two vignettes of the `new urban science' and municipal vacant property
mapping in order to argue that the mobilization of Big Data in the urban context doesn't necessarily produce a single,
greater understanding of the city as it actually is, but rather a highly variegated series of essentialized understandings of
the city that render it knowable, governable and intervene-able. Through the construction of new, data-driven urban
geographical imaginaries, these projects have opened up the space for urban interventions that work to depoliticize
urban injustices and valorize new kinds of technical expertise as the means of going about solving these problems,
opening up new possibilities for a remaking of urban space in the image of these sociotechnical paradigms. Ultimately, this
paper argues that despite the importance of Big Data, as both a discourse and practice, to emerging forms of urban
research and management, there is no singular or universal understanding of the urban that is promoted or developed
through the application of these new sources of data, which in turn opens up meaningful possibilities for developing
alternative uses of Big Data for understanding and intervening in the city in more emancipatory ways.

Introduction
We currently sit at the intersection of two concurrent
and often intersecting trends. First, we are faced with
an explosion of interest in, and debates about, cities
and urbanization. From the repeated invocation of the
(pernicious) fact that over half of the world's popula-
tion is currently living in cities for the first time in
human history, to the emergence of a kind of `pop
urbanism' ranging from the work of Richard Florida
and Ed Glaeser, to increasingly public debates about
the purported benefits and ills of gentrification, cities
are on the agenda (cf. Brenner and Schmid, 2014;
Peck, 2016). But the bigness of cities and the discourse
surrounding them is matched only by the bigness of
data used to understand them. At the same time as
cities have taken center stage as an object of concern,
we have at our disposal a wider array of data and
tools of analysis to help us understand social
processes, technologies which are thought to be revo-
lutionary for the way we conduct research and dis-
cover previously unforeseen knowledge. Emerging
sources of so-called `Big Data' are seen as enabling
new kinds of discoveries unhampered by longstanding
theoretical approaches, which only work to constrain
our abilities to interpret the data as it actually is (cf.
Anderson, 2008).
In concert, these two trends have produced a multi-
billion dollar a year industry around the provision of
so-called `smart cities' strategies. Whether in the form

of mega-projects designed to raise new `greenfield'
smart cities from scratch on coastal areas of South
Korea and in the desert of Abu Dhabi, or sell new
data analytics capabilities to floundering municipal
governments in search of a quick fix for imposed aus-
terity measures, the vision of the smart city combines
the emerging enthusiasm for urban life with the tools of
Big Data as the means of achieving that goal (cf. Batty,
2012; Halpern et al., 2013; Hollands, 2015; Kitchin,
2014). But, contrary to the dominant discourses about
the potential for these new smart city strategies to revo-
lutionize urban governance and management, there
isn't a single, linear pathway through Big Data that
produces a greater understanding of cities and urban
processes, much less inherently better outcomes.
Indeed, the dominant framing of the smart city offered
up by multinational technology companies remains just
one way among many that data is being applied to the
understanding of cities (cf. Barns, 2016; Leszczynski,
2016). While the overarching ethos of Big Data prom-
ises to provide a single, scientific, more all-encompass-
ing, universal and rational explanation of social
processes that is lacking in the broader scholarly litera-
ture on cities, the urban geographical imagination pro-
duced with the aid of Big Data remains a deeply
variegated and often contradictory one. Far from
superseding longstanding debates about the nature of
the urban, the pluralism of this data-driven urban geo-
graphical imagination actually validates contemporary
claims within urban geography that ``there can be no
single urban theory of ubiquitous remit'' (Leitner and
Sheppard, 2016: 231; see also Robinson and Roy, 2016,
for an argument in favor of a more pluralistic approach
to urban theory, contra Scott and Storper's, 2015 call
for a more unified understanding of the urban based
around the ideas of agglomeration and the urban land
nexus).
It is worth noting, however, that while `Big Data'
remains the buzzword du jour in the emerging model
of data-driven urbanism, in many ways, it is not the
`bigness' of the data that matters. Drawing on
Kitchin and McArdle's (2016) typology of Big Data,
it isn't even the velocity or `exhaustivity' of the data
in question that makes its application to understanding
and planning cities powerful; rather, it is simply import-
ant that it is `data'. I would argue that the dominant
discursive framing that valorizes Big Data has actually
valorized data of all shapes and sizes--big or small,
digital or analog, volunteered or captured, structured
or unstructured. As such, data writ-large has been
uniquely invested with a substantial power to not
only understand but, as I will describe in more detail
throughout this paper, also shape our world. So even
though we live in an ongoing `age of Big Data', it is
important to broaden our collective view to the way the
broader discourse around Big Data has reconfigured a
range of dynamics beyond the relatively narrow pur-
view of what we might be able to define with some
specificity as distinctly `Big' Data.
The rest of this paper explores the ways that the city
has been (re-)conceptualized through the use of (Big)
Data, the kinds of understandings promoted by these
uses, and how these understandings shape the kinds of
interventions into the urban that emerge from such
trajectories. As Rose-Redwood (2012) has argued
recently,
``whereas much is known about the history of quanti-
fication as a method of geographical analysis, far less
research has explored how numerical calculation itself
has historically reshaped political practices and the geo-
graphies of everyday life. This distinction between
quantitative methods in geography and the geography
of calculation is significant, because it draws attention
to the way in which calculative rationalities have been
used to refashion the world in their own image'' (300)
While this particular characterization constructs a
somewhat artificial binary between the ways that quan-
tification is reproduced in scholarship and how quanti-
fication reproduces particular kinds of socio-spatial
relationships outside of the academic realm, Rose-
Redwood is certainly right to draw attention to the
relative lack of understanding of the broader impacts
of quantification and computation. The fact that ``[w]e
live in an increasingly quantitative world'' (Sheppard,
2001: 549) has only further blurred the lines between
the `academic' and the `practical', as is evidenced by the
increasing prominence of Big Data, a discourse and
practice largely originating in the private sector,
within the academy itself.
In order to understand the interplay between these
different domains and their shared mode of data-centric
knowledge production, this paper utilizes two distinct
case studies in order to highlight how particular uses of
data help to refigure our understandings of the urban,
and shape the realm of possibilities for interventions
into these spaces. While these two vignettes, one
focused on the emerging field of `urban science' and
the other on the use of data by a municipal government
in order to understand vacant properties, are largely
unrelated, they are selected to highlight the diversity
of ways that Big Data is deployed in order to under-
stand cities. These two cases operate at different spatial
scales, ranging from the macro-scale redefinition of
what the urban actually is to a more meso-scale focus
on how we understand particular social problems as
situated in particular partitionings of urban space,
while also operating in different socio-institutional con-
texts, from scholarly knowledge to urban planning and
2 Big Data & Society
public administration. Indeed, these differences
between the two cases are manifest in the ways that
they point towards contradictory and competing under-
standings of urban processes, despite their shared focus
on the ostensibly straightforward use of data to reveal
unforeseen insights into the city. Ultimately, drawing
on work on the performativity of economics, this paper
argues that the mobilization of Big Data in the urban
context doesn't produce greater understandings of the
city as it actually is, but rather produces a series of
essentialized understandings of the city that render it
knowable, governable and, ultimately, intervene-able in
particular ways. Or, in the language of James C Scott
(1998), these techniques render the urban `legible',
though not simply to the state, but also simultaneously
to citizens and to capital. The understanding of `the
urban' promoted by these projects or initiatives is, at
best, extremely partial, but yet still powerful and influ-
ential. Through the construction of new urban geo-
graphical imaginaries, these projects have opened up
the space for urban interventions that work to depol-
iticize urban injustices and valorize new kinds of tech-
nical expertise as the means of going about solving
these problems, opening up new possibilities for a
remaking of urban space in the image of these socio-
technical paradigms.
Pre-histories of Big Data and the city
Although the emergence of a data-driven urban geo-
graphical imagination has become more pronounced
in the last several years, it is important to recognize
that these particular interminglings of scientific ideol-
ogy, new technologies and urban problem-solving
aren't all that new (Barnes, 2013). Appeals to `science'
and `quantification' (the two are usually seen to be
equivalent) as leading to higher forms of knowledge
have a long history in the social sciences in general,
and in geography and urban studies in particular, lead-
ing Doreen Massey (1999) to argue against the perva-
sive `physics envy' in human geography.1 Indeed, it is
worth noting that some of the earliest forms of quan-
titative geography emerged out of an adoption of con-
cepts and methods from the emerging field of social
physics, which prefigure some of the contemporary
trends, and theories, seen in data-driven urban research
(cf. Barnes and Wilson, 2014). Even though social sci-
entists of all stripes have long maintained a tense rela-
tionship with `science', as such, some of the earliest
social scientific scholarship on the city, conducted by
WEB DuBois and Emile Durkheim in the late 19th
century emphasized the use of quantitative methods
as a way of appealing to the newly emerging standards
of a scientific sociology. Similarly, the seminal works of
Robert Park, Ernest Burgess, and much of the rest of
the Chicago School of Urban Sociology mobilized both
the quantitative methodology of social surveys and
explanatory metaphors taken from the biological sci-
ences, signaling a longstanding trading zone between
the `hard' sciences and the ostensibly non-scientific
study of cities and urban places (Bulmer, 1981;
Burgess, 1923; Park, 1936).
The more practically driven work of planning and
governing cities has long fallen under similar ways of
thinking. And though the emergence and availability of
Big Data has brought with it a pervasive sense that
``something important has changed'' (Graham and
Shelton, 2013: 256), as Christine Boyer writes in her
history of the planning profession, ``[i]nformation has
always been the basis of planning'' (Boyer, 1986: 276,
emphasis added). Were one to go all the way back to
the birth of town and regional planning, the importance
of such scientific, data-driven approaches to planning
can be seen in Patrick Geddes' Camera Obscura and
the notion of the civic survey (Hall, 2002). More expli-
cit calls for a scientific approach to planning were being
made as early as the second decade of the 20th century,
as seen in George Ford's claim that ``city planning is
rapidly becoming as definite a science as pure engineer-
ing'' (Ford, 1913: 551). Even when less explicitly stated,
urban planning and management have long been
shaped by a range of technocratic experts drawing on
the powerful discourses associated with the production
of a `scientific' approach to cities inspired by the likes of
Frederick Taylor and others (Fairfield, 1994; Schultz
and McShane, 1978).
As historian Jennifer Light (2003) has documented,
the contemporary application of emerging scientific and
technological innovations to the problems of cities is
firmly rooted in similar trends in the Cold War era
immediately following World War II. Although
Light's book predates much of the more recent atten-
tion built around the smart cities movement, she makes
clear that even for those mid-20th century efforts at a
technoscientific approach to planning, ``[t]he quest for a
coherent science of the city was not new'' (Light, 2003:
48). It should be evident that this is even more the case
in the present day. That being said, while there is a
much longer history to this kind of data-driven urban
planning and governance than is often recognized, this
tendency has not been entirely persistent over the
course of the last century. As LeGates et al. (2009)
argue:
``The revolution in digital spatial technology has cre-
ated a new wave of enthusiasm for `scientific' urban
planning--the third in the 100-year history of modern
urban planning. Since the beginning of the last century
urban planners have alternately embraced rational
planning, rigorous scientific methods, and exploitation
Shelton 3
of technology, only to reject scientific city planning
when the application of the technology and the
theory of the day failed to produce the overly optimistic
results advocates had promised'' (763)
Indeed, one of the strongest statements against these
repeated attempts to make the study and planning of
cities more scientific came in the form of Douglass Lee's
(1973) ``Requiem for Large-Scale Models'', an excori-
ation of precisely the type of `hyper-comprehensive'
planning approaches being promoted by contemporary
smart cities advocates. And while one of Lee's primary
points of contention was that these models were con-
strained by a lack of available data, a problem it would
seem would be substantially less relevant in the present
moment, his arguments remain prescient and applic-
able to the broader scientific modeling impulse
being applied to cities in the present day (cf. Batty,
2014; Bro
¨ mmelstroet et al., 2014). Although practices
of quantification have always held a certain power
due to their air of objectivity (cf. Porter, 1996), the
contemporary moment surrounding Big Data seems
relatively novel in that it is data itself that is fore-
grounded, rather than particular techniques or
approaches to analyzing it. Data is increasingly ima-
gined as providing a fundamentally unique and sub-
stantive insight into the world around us, regardless
of the particular form of data or the particular ques-
tions being asked of it.
As these historical examples highlight, both the
`urban'--as a process and ideal--and the `city'--as a
juridical construct and material reality--are always in a
process of being re-imagined and re-made through
socio-technical practices and processes. The urban as
we are able to know it doesn't preexist these forms of
knowledge production, but comes into being through
them. Inspired by the work of Donald MacKenzie and
Timothy Mitchell, among others, the rest of this paper
applies the insights of work on the social construction
and performativity of the economy to the social
construction and performativity of the urban, focusing
on how the constitutive discourse and practice of
Big Data is reshaping what we understand the
essential nature of the urban to be, and therefore,
how we imagine ourselves to be able to change it. As
Mitchell writes, ``[t]he economy came into being as a
self-contained, internally dynamic, and statistically
measurable sphere of social action, scientific analysis,
and political regulation'' (Mitchell, 2002: 4); so too is it
the case with the urban. Using two vignettes, the fol-
lowing section documents the different ways in which
the contemporary focus on data is producing new kinds
of representations and understandings of the urban,
giving way to different ways of intervening in these
spaces.
Unpacking the data-driven urban
geographical imagination
Key to the rethinking of data's role in contemporary
processes of urban planning and governance is the rec-
ognition that data does not inherently ``offer a higher
form of intelligence and knowledge that can generate
insights that were previously impossible, with the aura
of truth, objectivity, and accuracy'' (Boyd and
Crawford, 2012: 663). Rather, not only is data--even
Big Data--incredibly partial and value laden, but it is
also more than just a reflection, even a distorted one.
Indeed, drawing on work on performativity we can say
that data of all kinds does not simply capture the world
as it actually is, but in the process of representing it,
also transforms it. In his seminal analyses of the per-
formative role of economics, Donald MacKenzie writes
that ``Financial economics . . . did more than analyze
markets; it altered them. It was an `engine'. . . an
active force transforming its environment, not a
camera passively recording it'' (MacKenzie, 2006: 12).
Indeed, the same can be said of any such mobilization
of data, though the effects of the performativity of data
are in many ways increasingly masked by an ideology
that continues to frame data as an objective and value-
free way of assessing the world as it actually is. While
similar currents of thought have long been applied to
questions of mapping (cf. Harley, 1989), recent work by
Aalbers (2014a) has explicitly brought together the
approaches of critical cartography and performativity,
arguing that ``cartographers do not simply produce
knowledge about geography; they produce geography
through their observations and measurements.
Mapping contributes to the making of geography
rather than simply describing geography . . . the act of
mapping a place becomes part of shaping that place.
Mapping performs, shapes and formats geography,
rather than merely observing how it functions''
(2014a: 532). That is, rather than simply shifting from
seeing the map as a neutral transmitter of information
to seeing the map as the product of power relations (cf.
Crampton, 2001), the performativity thesis argues, in
effect, that ``it is the map that precedes the territory''
(Baudrillard, 1994: 1).
As MacKenzie and others argue, ``It is not (only)
about economics being `right' or `wrong' but (also,
and perhaps more important) about it being `able' or
`unable' to transform the world'' (MacKenzie et al.,
2007: 2). Again, the same can be said for how data-
driven analyses construct new understandings of the
urban; it is less important that these analyses be correct
or comprehensive, per se, but rather that through such
analyses, these technologies (and the systems of human
knowledge organized around them) enable a particular
way of seeing social processes and understanding them
4 Big Data & Society
as problems to be (and that can be) solved. While much
of the literature on the performativity of economics
focuses on how ostensibly detached scholarly know-
ledge about the economy has come to influence the
actual practices and functioning of the economy, my
focus here is not exclusively on the construction of
the urban by scholars, though that is certainly a
part of it. Given that one feature of the ongoing
`data revolution' is a blurring of the boundaries
between academic, industry and governmental know-
ledges through the widespread application of data to
a variety of problems, any analytical separation
between these spheres is tenuous at best. As such, the
two vignettes that follow explore ways that both schol-
arly interpretations of the urban, as well as more
`applied' or practical mobilizations of data to under-
stand urban processes in fact work to construct the
urban as we know it.
The `scientific' redefinition of the city
Although much of the contemporary discourse around
the application of Big Data to cities has focused on the
role of multinational technology corporations active in
the nascent smart cities industry (cf. Greenfield, 2013;
Hollands, 2008, 2015; McNeill, 2015; So
¨ derstro
¨ m et al.,
2014, Viitanen and Kingston, 2014; Wiig, 2015), one of
the more prominent examples of how Big Data
has been mobilized to rethink the urban is in the
form of the more academic `new urban science'
(cf. Townsend, 2015). Led largely by the likes of physi-
cists and computer scientists working in new start-up
academic research centers like NYU's Center for
Urban Science and Progress or the University of
Chicago's Urban Center for Computation and Data,
this nascent academic field attempts to apply the ana-
lytical tools of the `hard' sciences to what they see as the
insufficiently `scientific' field of urban studies. Though
some more conventionally trained social scientists have
attempted to push forward the call for a more `scien-
tific' approach to urban studies (cf. Solecki et al 2013
and Batty 2013, who has been arguing for such a scien-
tific approach from within a more conventional geo-
graphic framework for several decades, or similar
such calls being made a half-century ago by Berry
1964), arguably the most prominent boosters and exem-
plars of this approach have been the Santa Fe Institute-
affiliated physicists Geoffrey West and Luis Bettencourt.
Thanks to the media-friendly packaging of their research
as the search for a single `universal law' of urbanization,
West and Bettencourt's work has led to a New York
Times profile in 2010, a feature on the popular NPR
radio program RadioLab, a widely viewed TED Talk
in 2011 and a range of other recurring media inquiries
about urban issues in the years since.
Though much of the supporting discourse around
this new urban science tends towards a hubristic dis-
missal of all previous scholarly research into cities and
urban processes, such as the aforementioned work by
mid-20th century quantitative geographers and urban-
ists like Berry and Batty, what is most important about
their work from my perspective is that it highlights how
the epistemological position associated with much of
the conventional Big Data research leads directly to a
particular ontological position about what the city
actually is. For West and Bettencourt, the epistemo-
logical commitments of quantification require them to
develop an ontology of the urban that is constrained
entirely by that which is most easily counted. In their
case, a range of relatively accessible (if geographically
uneven) data on patents, crime, gross domestic product,
and income (presumably among other things), points to
the fundamental role of population size in determining
the nature of the city. The city as imagined by urban
science is one of, quite simply, little more than a mass
of population. As Bettencourt and West say plainly,
``size is the major determinant of most characteristics
of a city; history, geography and design have secondary
roles'' (Bettencourt and West, 2010: 912). Though in
one of several papers reporting on their research, they
attempt to walk back these claims by saying that
``population size is not so much a causal force''
(Bettencourt et al., 2010: 6), such a statement pales in
comparison to their repeated focus, even within the
same paper, on arguing that ``population size plays a
fundamental role in this approach'' (Bettencourt et al.,
2010: 6), and even going as far as to admit that the
entire research project is analytically predetermined to
be about population: ``Our primary analytical focus
here was concerned with the consequences of popula-
tion size on a variety of urban metrics'' (Bettencourt
et al., 2007: 7305) (Figure 1).
But the urban geographical imaginary developed by
West and Bettencourt isn't defined entirely by popula-
tion size, but also by universality. Throughout their
published findings, West and Bettencourt are at pains
to emphasize just how universal and fundamental their
law of superlinear scaling is. There is, however, little to
no reflection on how their theorizations are the result of
unstated assumptions about geographic processes that
are an artifact of their data collection procedures. In his
widely viewed 2011 TED Talk, West claims that ``This
15 percent rule is true no matter where you are on the
planet--Japan, Chile, Portugal, Scotland, doesn't
matter. Always, all the data shows it's the same, despite
the fact that these cities have evolved independently.
Something universal is going on'' (West, 2011). It is
unclear, however, whether the data West and
Bettencourt mobilize actually substantiates such
claims to universality. In one of their earlier papers
Shelton 5
on the subject, they described having ``obtained data-
sets at this level of detail mostly for the US, where
typically more data are available and in more particular
cases for European countries and China'' (Bettencourt
et al., 2007: 7302), which would, at best, account for
only about a third of the global population. It is unclear
from their website and published papers whether data
collection was entirely limited to these countries, or
whether cities in Latin America, Africa, and Asia
were also included, and if excluded, what impact
these cities might have on the supposedly universal scal-
ing laws. Paraphrasing a recent intervention by Susan
Parnell and Edgar Pieterse (2016), ``either [these places]
must be ignored, or the theory, method and data of
urban [science] must change'' (p. 241). Similarly,
through the use of statistics aggregated to either jurid-
ical or functional urban boundaries, West and
Bettencourt fail to consider that the social processes
embodied in their metrics may be geographically
uneven within each city. For instance, in their invoca-
tion of patent registrations as a proxy measure for
innovation, West and Bettencourt assume that such
innovation is distributed equally across the city,
rather than concentrated in particular sub-urban local-
ities. The same could be said for their use of data on
income, crime, pollution, and so on. Unless each of
these variables corresponded appropriately with popu-
lation aggregates at finer spatial resolutions, which is
highly unlikely given the increasingly splintered nature
of contemporary cities (cf. Graham and Marvin, 2001),
the superlinear scaling ideal would seem to break down
at any other scale of analysis, further suggesting that
the theory itself seems to be more an artifact of the data
used to create it than the objective identification of a
fundamental socio-spatial process.
Borrowing from Timothy Mitchell, these flaws in
West and Bettencourt's logical construction do not so
much matter,
``Since these calculations were helping to bring into
being the world they calculated, success d[oes] not
necessarily depend on having the most accurate figures.
What mattered more was whether the calculations
enabled the network to be conceived and built . . . suc-
cessful calculative devices are not necessarily those that
are the most statistically complete or mathematically
rigorous. They are those that make it possible to con-
ceive of a network, or market, or national economy, or
whatever is being designed, and assist in the practical
work of bringing it into being'' (Mitchell, 2008: 1118)
Indeed, West and Bettencourt's redefinition of the
urban isn't important simply because of the attention
it has gotten or its attempts to supersede existing urban
theories, but because its understanding of what the
urban actually is, in turn shapes the way we can under-
stand what is and isn't possible in terms of policy inter-
ventions in important ways. Ultimately, the effect of
West and Bettencourt's population-centric theory of
urban scaling is a naturalization of the status quo.
Echoing David Harvey's (1973 [2009]) early critiques
of quantitative geography's valorization and natural-
ization of stylized models of urban land use, the logical
result of arguing that the quintessential urban problems
of wealth inequality, crime, pollution, and so on, are all
directly tied to a single universal law or model--in this
Figure 1. Visualizing the law of urban scaling, from Bettencourt and West (2010).

case, population size--is to say that there's nothing we
can do to change these things.
When asked in an interview about the practical
implications of their theories, West responded that
``The scaling laws tell you that despite all of the efforts
of planners, geographers, economists, architects, and
politicians, and all of the local history, geography,
and culture, somehow cities end up having to
obey these scaling laws. We need to be aware of
those forces when we design and redesign cities''
(Greenwood, 2012). Or, as they argue in one of their
earlier papers, ``The realization that most urban indi-
cators scale with city size nontrivially, implying
increases per capita in crime or innovation rates and
decreases on the demand for certain infrastructure, is
essential to set realistic targets for local policy''
(Bettencourt et al., 2007: 7306). That is, West and
Bettencourt argue that all cities are, at their core, the
same, and that there is nothing we can particularly do
to change that fact. `Realistic' in this sense would seem
to mean an acceptance of such fundamental laws and a
retreat from meaningful, substantive efforts to change
them. Although West and Bettencourt's influence on
broader urban debates isn't so great that planners
and policymakers around the world are likely to aban-
don their efforts entirely and simply let cities run their
`natural' course, their redefinition of the urban as an
essentially unchangeable biological organism provides
a kind of cover or justification for the lack of meaning-
ful improvements in urban life from what are, in most
cases, neoliberal policy interventions. In a New York
Times profile of West, it is said that West believes
that ``creating a more sustainable society will require
our big cities to get even bigger'' (Lehrer, 2010). It
would seem to follow, however, that if we were to
desire minimizing the range of negatives that come
with increased city size, the only solution would not
be to further grow cities, but to depopulate them, a
fact that seems much more in tune with West's admit-
tedly neo-Malthusian thinking (Greenwood, 2012).
Regardless, such a laissez faire approach to urban
policy remains grounded in a theoretical construct
that is itself significantly the product of uneven, and
in some cases potentially incommensurate, data, but
which is widely accepted due to its appeals to the sup-
posed objectivity and rationality inherent in Big Data
analytics, and its ability to reinforce the contemporary
policy status quo.
Vacant property mapping and the
(re)production of territorial stigma
While the example of urban science's attempts to
reshape our understandings of the urban at a macro-
level demonstrates how the data-driven urban
geographical imagination is being produced in very
public and visible ways, our understandings of the
nature of urban space are also being shaped at finer
spatial scales, and in much more mundane ways. In
particular, I am interested in the mobilization of new
web mapping tools to produce quick snapshots of dif-
ferent datasets on urban processes, which has allowed
for a solidification of urban geographical imaginaries
oriented around the idea of `problem areas'. While this
parlance is not particularly novel, through this phrasing
I hope to draw attention to the double meaning of the
`problem area' and the increasingly important role of
data in its construction: on the one hand, different
actors and institutions are able to understand that
urban social problems are `of a place' and rooted in
particular geographic contexts, while, on the other
hand, simultaneously understanding particular places
as defined through and by their association with these
problems.
In many ways, the growth of simplistic map mashup
visualizations is tied to an increasing awareness of the
importance of geography to understanding social issues,
and the growth of municipal data that is (or can be)
explicitly georeferenced to particular places within the
city. That is, these visualizations are the result of simul-
taneously social and technical processes. But these visu-
alizations, and the kinds of questions that spur them on,
are problematic in that they tend to treat social and
spatial processes in isolation. Focusing on questions
like ``where is x?'' or ``where are the y located?'', repro-
duces the kind of `spatial fetishism' long critiqued by
geographers, defined as ``the creation in the structure
of spatial relationships of an autonomous determinant
to history and human action separated from the struc-
ture of social relations and the production process that
generates it'' (Soja, 1980: 208). With particular reference
to the issue of collecting and representing spatial data,
Wilson (2011) argues that ``the pervasiveness of counting
in these kinds of urban data practices . . . fixates on the
occurrence, while displacing the conditions of that
occurrence. Counting decontextualizes. Counting does
not remove meaning . . . counting matters too much''
(865). That is, in simply focusing on mapping the
locations and concentrations of x or y urban problem,
these visualizations fail to attend to how these problems,
and certainly any meaningful solution for them, goes
beyond a set of latitude and longitude coordinates or a
particular bounded spatial unit like a census tract or
municipal boundary. As the geographer Nik Blomley
has written, ``Mapmaking and maplike visualizations
play a central role in power relations and the construc-
tion of space, property, and social identity. . . to help
make possible the very idea of `space' as an abstract
category, separate from the processes by which it is por-
trayed'' (2004: 54­55).

To draw again on theories of performativity, the act
of mapping a given urban problem doesn't necessarily
produce a meaningful understanding of the problem,
though it does, however, help to produce the problem
itself, and particular understandings of space underly-
ing it. In the case of vacant and abandoned properties
in Louisville, Kentucky, a variety of public-facing map-
ping platforms help to construct a geographical imagin-
ary of this problem as being in many ways synonymous
with the city's predominantly poor and African-
American West End. Initially developed in the early
20th century as a white, working-class suburban area,
the West End underwent significant racial transition in
the mid-20th century, due in large part to a combin-
ation of urban renewal programs targeting what were
then predominantly black neighborhoods, as well as the
widespread enforcement of housing desegregation laws
in predominantly white areas for the first time. As
Cummings and Price (1997) note, white flight from
the West End resulted in a halving of the area's white
population throughout the 1960s, and again through
the 1970s, leading the West End to be, at present,
approximately 80% African-American. While the
West End has long been neglected by the municipal
government, like countless other impoverished and
majority­minority neighborhoods across the country,
recent years have brought a renewed attention to the
West End, and an attempt to address the so-called `9th
Street Divide' that separates the West End from the rest
of the city (Crutcher, 2013). When one prominent local
urbanist was asked during a talk at a local historical
society what issue he would tackle if he had a magic
wand, he responded simply with ``the West End'',
a comment important for simultaneously denoting the
importance the area holds to the city's future, as well as
for its synecdoche, or the way a variety of problems
come to be represented in the figure of the West End
as a whole.
One of the key means through which this attention
to the West End has been focused is through Mayor
Greg Fischer's initiative to address the growth of
vacant and abandoned properties in the city, the major-
ity of which are concentrated within the West End.
In early 2013, Fischer articulated a goal of reducing
the city's number of vacant and abandoned properties
by 40% over three years, and 67% over five years
(Bailey, 2013), and developed VAPStat, a spin-off of
the city's much-touted LouieStat performance improve-
ment program focused entirely on tracking, and pub-
licly reporting on, the city's progress on meeting
various goals related to the vacant properties cam-
paign. Fischer even assigned key responsibilities
for the vacant properties campaign to the city's
Innovation Delivery Team, a group of experts funded
by Bloomberg Philanthropies to introduce more
`innovative' approaches to municipal governments
around the country, with a particular focus on the
use of data to understand and solve problems facing
municipal governments. As such, the question
of vacant properties, and the West End more generally,
became intimately intermingled with the city's broader
focus on the use of new data sources and analytics. But
the application of these data-driven and data-
centric approaches to understanding vacant
properties has not been entirely straightforward, as
the tools being used to more rationally manage the
problem also have a considerable hand in shaping the
problem itself.
Beginning in early 2014, Louisville Metro
Government partnered with the nascent technology
company OpportunitySpace in order to serve as a
test case for their platform, listing city-owned land
bank properties as part of a government-sponsored
`Lots of Possibility' contest, in which innovative
ideas for redeveloping vacant properties could be sub-
mitted for the chance to receive both the deed to a
property and an additional grant to fund the proposed
project (Louisville Metro Government, n.d.).
OpportunitySpace is a web-based platform, developed
by then-graduate students in Harvard's Kennedy
School of Government, that aims to leverage munici-
pal open data about vacant properties, especially those
that are publicly owned through land banks, in order
to stimulate private investment in these properties.
OpportunitySpace allows users to sort or gather
more information on these properties according to a
range of characteristics: their size, location, cost,
zoning classifications, etc. (see Figure 2), in order to
make data that's technically publicly available more
publicly accessible (Capps, 2014). And while some
Metro government employees involved with the city's
vacant properties campaign didn't see
OpportunitySpace as providing the kind of single
portal for property data that could rationalize the
vacant property redevelopment process, they did see
the platform as being potentially important for the
ultimate goal of raising awareness about the city's
struggle with vacant properties and drumming up
interest in the Lots of Possibility competition and
other government initiatives. That is, rather than pro-
viding a comprehensive information portal about
vacant properties, OpportunitySpace sees itself as
``reflect[ing] cities' proactive posture related to redevel-
opment'' (Capps, 2014), focused primarily on the
channeling of interest and energy related to these
issues into the solution of market-based redevelop-
ment of these properties.
And while the OpportunitySpace example is interest-
ing in that it is tied explicitly to a particular set of inter-
ventions, perhaps more interesting is the visualization
8 Big Data & Society
Figure 3. Heatmap of vacant properties in Louisville.

of vacant properties seen in Figure 3. Taken from the
Louisville Metro Government website--and lauded as
a centerpiece of the city's vacant properties campaign
(Louisville Metro Government, 2013)--this heatmap
view of vacant properties provides arguably the most
succinct visual summary of the geography of vacant
properties in Louisville. While it is evident that the
West End certainly isn't the only place in the city with
concentrations of vacant properties, the map does
make it clear that the problem is acutely concentrated
west of 9th Street, a fact confirmed by analysis of open
datasets provided by Louisville Metro. Though the
properties listed in the OpportunitySpace database of
landbank properties are more acutely concentrated in
the West End neighborhoods of Portland, Russell and
Park Hill, this city-produced heatmap seems to expand
the scope of the problem to encompass practically the
entire West End as a whole.
That being said, this map doesn't simply represent
the geography of vacant properties in the city, but it
also works to produce a particular, and I would argue
overly simplistic, socio-spatial imaginary of inequality
in Louisville, one that in turn re-produces the territorial
stigma developed around the West End. Because the
contours of the map place the most significant concen-
trations squarely within the conventional boundaries of
the West End, the problem of vacant properties is quite
easily extrapolated to be just one part of the broader
problem presented by the West End and encapsulated
in the imaginary of the 9th Street Divide. Even though
these kinds of public-facing, interactive web map inter-
faces have been thought to provide an alternative form
of knowledge politics, emphasizing a kind of ``knowing
through exploring [that] stands in contrast to the carto-
graphic narratives approach that relies more upon a
`receive and believe' paradigm'' (Elwood and
Leszczynski, 2013: 554), I would argue that these
cases of vacant property mapping in Louisville do any-
thing but. Even though there always remains an open
possibility of the same, ostensibly authoritative, map
being interpreted differently by different people (cf.
Elwood, 2006), the structuring of these maps, and the
inability of users to contribute to, or reconfigure, or
cross-reference the data being represented in these
cases, tends to minimize such possibilities for alterna-
tive forms of knowledge production. Instead, following
Elwood and Mitchell (2013), we can see these represen-
tations serving as sites for both ``the formation of pol-
itical subjects [and] the formation of interpretive frames
that can mobilize these subjects for action'', although in
a manner that channels the map reader into a single
interpretive frame, rather than allowing for a plurality
of representations. In this case, these visualizations
reinforce what Wacquant et al. call ``the mistake of
artificially insulating the poor in social space'' (2014:
1271), reifying the `blemish of place' associated with
living in a predominantly poor and African-American
area such as the West End. In effect, these kinds of
visualizations implicitly blame the people living there
for everything from redlining to property speculation
and the foreclosure crisis that fed into the production of
the city's vacant property problem, cordoning off such
areas from their surrounding social and spatial context
in order to understand them as somehow separate and
apart from the rest of the city, despite the fact that
many of these problems originate in the desires and
actions of more affluent whites living elsewhere in
the city (or even outside of it altogether). As Doreen
Massey has written ``How many times has the
`inner city problem' been `explained' in terms of char-
acteristics totally internal to those areas?--to a sup-
posed lack of skilled labor, to the actions of planners,
or, worst of all, to the psychological propensities and
sociological characteristics of their inhabitants?''
(Massey, 1979: 57).
By seeing these problems as restricted to a particular
territory, and as the result of an engrained socio-spatial
pathology, the logical solutions offered by civic leaders
rarely, if ever, address the root causes of these prob-
lems. From larger scale projects like the building of a
Wal-Mart and a methane biodigester plant in the area
to the more piecemeal efforts associated with the Lots
of Possibility competition and one local developer's
artist-led gentrification of vacant shotgun houses in
the Portland neighborhood, the reproduction of the
`reputational ghetto' becomes itself the impetus for par-
ticular kinds of `revitalization' initiatives (Slater and
Anderson, 2012). Indeed, contra Aalbers' (2014b) argu-
ment around the way that maps can prescribe policies
of planned shrinkage and the withdrawal of services
from already neglected urban areas, these maps actu-
ally promote more active engagements with the West
End, albeit still in a way that tends to disempower
existing residents in favor of outsiders with capital
who are privileged in municipal decision-making
processes.
But the use of data in order to map and track vacant
properties in Louisville is less than straightforward.
Despite Mayor Fischer's plan to reduce the number
of vacant properties by a certain percentage at certain
times, the actual numbers of vacant properties provided
by the city have been described by some as ``just
guesses'' that are divorced from the on-the-ground real-
ity of the city's vacant properties problem (Carter,
2013). Because the classification of vacancy and aban-
donment by the Metro government relies on a series of
discrete indicators, such as properties without water
service, with unaddressed code violations or unpaid
property taxes, there is a tendency to undercount the
number of properties that may actually be vacant or
10 Big Data & Society
abandoned at any given time. One community organ-
ization's on-the-ground participatory mapping project
found that Metro government was underestimating the
number of vacant properties in some neighborhoods by
up to 80% (Katayama, 2012). And while more accurate
or comprehensive counts of the city's vacant properties
may only show the problem to be further concentrated
in the West End, this contention over the actual way
that vacant properties are counted in order to be
mapped ``highlights that data is never simply an object-
ive representation of the world and always a possible
forum for political contestation'' (Shelton et al., 2015b:
18). It also further underscores a key element of the
performativity thesis as applied to the question of the
production of urban territories: data need not be
entirely accurate in order to produce an actionable
understanding of particular spaces and social processes.
Unlike the reimagining of the urban at the core of
West and Bettencourt's new urban science, which nat-
uralizes the status quo for the sake of non-intervention,
these maps of vacant properties in Louisville seem to
presuppose intervention by positioning the question of
vacant properties as a kind of information problem.
OpportunitySpace is explicitly conceived of as a way
to encourage private investments in vacant and
abandoned properties by providing otherwise difficult-
to-access information to potential investors.
Importantly, however, OpportunitySpace isn't targeted
at, for instance, the long-term residents of the West End
who are surrounded by vacant properties and must live
with their deleterious effects, but rather at a largely
white, middle-class population from outside these
neighborhoods who are able to capitalize on the
longer-term disinvestment occurring in the West End
in order to benefit themselves and realize their own
visions for what the West End ought to look like.
And though the Louisville Metro Government's heat-
map of vacant properties is less directly tied to a par-
ticular kind of intervention, the reproduction of a
socio-spatial imaginary that sees the West End as some-
how separated from the rest of the city, as a kind of
`problem area', helps to justify practically any policy
intervention into it, even if these interventions tend to
address the symptoms or effects rather than the causes.
Conclusion
Ultimately, this paper has argued that despite the
importance of Big Data as both a discourse and prac-
tice to emerging forms of urban research and manage-
ment, there is no singular or universal understanding of
the urban that is promoted or developed through the
application of these new sources of data. Like contem-
porary conceptualizations of both the urban (Robinson
and Roy, 2016) and Big Data (Kitchin and McArdle,
2016), more generally, the urban geographical imagin-
ation in the age of Big Data is complex, contradictory
and highly variegated, operating across multiple scales
through different kinds of interpersonal and institu-
tional networks. Despite claims that ``with enough
data, the numbers speak for themselves'' (Anderson,
2008), providing a single, optimal understanding of
any given social phenomenon, the data-driven urban
geographical imagination causes us to understand the
city simultaneously as something both fundamentally
unchangeable, as in the work of West and
Bettencourt, and as something imminently intervene-
able (assuming we have access to the right informa-
tion), as demonstrated by the case of vacant property
mapping in Louisville. Setting aside the pervasive issues
of data quality that are seen in both of the cases dis-
cussed above, this contradiction between the vision of
data `speaking for itself' and the reality of a plurality of
voices emanating from different mobilizations of data,
points towards a fundamental flaw in the belief that
data necessarily leads to improved understandings of
cities, or any other given phenomena. Regardless of
these contradictions, there remains a general tendency
in these particular strands of data-driven analysis to
neglect the fundamental underlying processes at work,
isolating the issue in question from broader social and
spatial contexts that influence the outcomes of any
given intervention. Despite Big Data's
relationality--understood in this instance as the ability
to combine and cross-reference disparate
datasets--dominant usages and interpretations of
such data remain fundamentally non-relational in the
social sense, failing to identify or understand the con-
nections between seemingly separate or isolated
phenomena.
While these dominant data-driven imaginaries have
largely failed to produce a substantively better under-
standing of urban processes, these kinds of intellectual
projects have accomplished something akin to what
Timothy Mitchell describes as the ``transferr[al of]
this knowledge to new sites . . . open[ing] up a certain
distance, the distance between the field and the comput-
ing office, between the farmer and the colonial survey
officer, between the iron triangulation marker and the
paper map'' (Mitchell, 2002: 92). That is, urban know-
ledge is increasingly removed from the urban itself,
codified only in a series of quantifiable measures that
allow for an increasingly detached, and putatively
objective and scientific understanding of its true
essence. As with earlier attempts to understand cities
through scientific methods, it is unlikely that many of
these experiments in applying Big Data to our under-
standings of the city will reveal previously unforeseen
insights (Light, 2003). It is almost assured, however,
that these new ways of studying and intervening in
Shelton 11
urban processes will reshape our conceptions of how
cities ought to be understood and planned, resulting
in a privileging of new forms of data and methods of
analysis at the expense of more historically and geo-
graphically complex and grounded insights.
Of course, just as historical connections between
quantitative methodologies, positivist epistemologies
and reactionary politics were contingent circumstances
(Wyly, 2009), so too is the contemporary constellation
of smart cities, urban science, and other urban data
initiatives. While the above vignettes highlight the
ways that dominant mobilizations of data tend to
depoliticize certain ways of understanding and inter-
vening in urban spaces, many of the same sources of
data and new mapping technologies offer significant
potential for pushing back against such representa-
tions. From the speculative mappings of Neil
Brenner's Urban Theory Lab (cf. Katsikis, 2014;
Urban Theory Lab-GSD, 2013), which demonstrate
the incredibly partial understanding of the urban pro-
moted by the likes of West and Bettencourt, or
attempts to connect the seemingly discrete, segregated
spaces of Louisville's West End to the broader social
and spatial context that gave rise to problems like
those of vacant properties (cf. Shelton, 2015; Shelton
et al., 2015a, 2015b, for more discussions of alternative
mappings of the West End and the geographies of
Louisville's vacant properties problem), mapping and
data visualization maintains a significant potential for
shaping more complex and emancipatory understand-
ings of urban space.2 So while the production of the
data-driven urban geographical imaginary may tend
towards a kind of post-political naturalization of the
contemporary urban condition, such an imaginary is
in no way inherent or uncontested. Indeed, through
the creative analysis and visualization of these new
sources of data, alternative understandings and inter-
ventions can be proposed and pursued, potentially
enabling more democratic and egalitarian ways of
actually producing the urban as we know and experi-
ence it.
