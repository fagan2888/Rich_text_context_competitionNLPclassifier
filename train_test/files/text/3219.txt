Abstract
Capital requirements play a key role in the supervision and regulation of banks. The Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision is now changing the current framework by introduc-
ing risk-sensitive capital charges. There have been concerns that this will unduly increase
volatility in the banks' capital. Furthermore, when the credit supply is rationed, capital
requirements may exacerbate an economic downturn. We examine the problem of cyclical-
ity in a macroeconomic model which explicitly takes regulatory constraints into account.
We find that the capital buffer which banks hold on top of the required minimum plays a
crucial role in mitigating the volatility in capital requirements. Therefore, despite the fact
that capital charges may vary significantly over time, the effects on the macroeconomy
will be moderate.

Non-technical summary
In 2004 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published a framework paper on cap-
ital measurement and capital standards. The revised accord - known under the acronym
Basel II - will eventually replace the existing accord on capital standards. Its main pur-
pose is to achieve a better alignment of regulatory capital with economic capital by means
of an adequate measurement of the quality of the banks' assets. However, concerns have
been voiced that the increased risk sensitivity of Basel II might lead to excessive volatility
in capital requirements. In fact, previous research has shown that capital requirements
might increase by up to 45% over the course of the business cycle. The Basel Commit-
tee has met some of those initial concerns by making the requirements less sensitive to
risk changes than originally envisaged. Having said that, many observers still expect the
cyclicality of capital charges to be significant.
A better measurement of credit risk in Basel II will bring about clear microeconomic
benefits as it reduces the opportunity for regulatory arbitrage. On the other hand, cap-
ital management might become more difficult because capital charges may increase just
when banks are seeing their equity capital erode due to write-offs in their loan portfo-
lios. Furthermore, cyclical changes in capital charges can have a pro-cyclical effect on
the macroeconomy when banks are forced to reduce their lending during an economic
downturn.
Previous research has largely focused on the pure cyclicality of capital charges, whereas
our paper tries to assess their pro-cyclical effect on the macroeconomy, too. To this end,
we introduce a model of the bank lending channel which explicitly takes into account
minimum capital requirements. One novel feature of this model is that it allows banks to
hold a capital buffer on top of the regulatory minimum. This is important because a bank
might react to an increase of capital charges by reducing its capital buffer rather than its
loan supply.
When calibrated to real data our findings suggest that the capital buffer does indeed
play a crucial role in mitigating the volatility in capital charges as it reduces the cyclicality
of the actual capital ratio by roughly half when compared to the regulatory minimum. The
results also show that the pro-cylical effects on the macroeconomy are unlikely to be severe.

Requirements
1 Introduction
Once again capital requirements have attracted considerable attention since the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision announced a revision of the current accord1 on capital
regulation (Basel II). A revision was deemed necessary since the existing accord led to
severe market distortions as banks swapped low-risk assets against riskier ones with more
favourable risk weighting relative to their expected returns (regulatory arbitrage). The
new accord, which will take effect in 2006, envisages better aligning regulatory capital
with economic risk (sometimes dubbed economic capital) by attributing more adequate
risk weights to the banks' assets.2
Although the micro-economic foundations of capital requirements are now fairly well
understood, their macroeconomic consequences are still rather opaque. Concerns have
been voiced that the increased risk sensitivity of Basel II might lead to excessive volatility
in banks' capital ratios. Hence, in opposition to the original intention, overall financial
stability might be jeopardised.
In essence, minimum capital requirements consist of a measure of portfolio risk and
a mapping of risk to minimum capital. Banks which are subject to minimum capital
requirements are required to hold at least the minimum required capital. With respect
to the measurement of credit risk, two approaches are usually considered: either by asset
type or by asset quality. The first one ranks assets by classes of borrowers and attributes
a fixed risk weight to each of them according to their perceived fundamental risk. Total
credit risk of a bank's portfolio is given as the weighted sum of its constituent assets. By
construction, portfolio risk does not change over time when the total sum of assets and
the share of each asset type remain constant. By contrast, risk measures based on asset
quality such as the value at risk (VaR) try to assess potential economic losses and may
vary over time. We will say that corresponding risk weights are risk-sensitive.3

3Quality based risk measures can be further distinguished between those, which are calculated for each
asset separately on a stand-alone basis and those which also take correlation effects between assets into
account.

In order to harmonise international capital regulation, the Basel Committee published
the so-called Basle Capital Accord in 1988, which has since become a cornerstone of
international capital regulation. It largely depends on fixed risk weights. Credit risk is
measured as the 8 per cent share of a bank's risk weighted credit exposure.4 For example,
OECD countries have a risk weight of 0 %, banks in OECD countries have a risk weight
of 20 %, mortgage banks of 50 % and non-financial firms of 100 %.
The accord has always been subject to criticism since it does not truly reflect a bank's
credit risk. To remedy that deficiency the Basel Committee recently carried out a major
revision of the capital accord (Basel II). When it takes effect in 2006, banks will be able to
choose from among several approaches. The standard approach is based on the borrowers
public ratings such as those from Moody's, Standard & Poor's or Fitch IBCA. Specific risk
weights are attributed to the respective rating classes, ranging from 0% for a AAA rating
to 150% for ratings below B-. More sophisticated banks will be eligible for the two IRB
approaches 5, which permit the use of the banks' own internal rating systems to quantify
the creditworthiness of their debtors. In the IRB approaches banks must estimate the
probability of default (PD) of their debtors, which is calibrated to a time horizon of one
year. Capital charges are calculated by means of a risk weight function which attributes a
specific risk weight to the probability of default. In both the standard approach and the
IRB approaches total capital charges are given by the 8 per cent share of risk-weighted
assets.
Aligning regulatory and economic capital has obvious microeconomic benefits as it
reduces regulatory arbitrage. However, by increasing the sensitivity to credit risk, the
new accord will also make required minimum capital more cyclical. This might pose
severe capital management problems to banks, as capital charges are likely to increase
in an economic downturn just when banks are seeing their equity capital erode due to
write-offs in their loan portfolios. Importantly, the cyclicality of capital charges might
also have significant macroeconomic consequences in an economic downturn, when raising
new capital is difficult and banks are forced to reduce their lending. In the following we
will therefore distinguish between the cyclicality of capital charges and its pro-cyclical
4The Accord was amended in 1998 by the inclusion of market risk in order to take account of the
growing significance of banks trading book positions. Apart from the prudential recognition of market
risk, the 1998 amendment was important in regard to another aspect, as it allowed banks for the first time
to calculate their market risk positions by means of their own value-at-risk based market models.

consequences to the macroeconomy. We think that, in doing so, we are filling a gap in
the existing literature, since most studies so far have concentrated on the purely cyclical
effects of Basel II.
Many empirical studies on Basel II expect significant swings in minimum capital over
the course of a business cycle. However, the variety of estimates is rather large. To a
great deal this can be explained by the different approaches the authors take. Most of
these studies assess the cyclical patterns of capital charges under Basel II by performing
numerical simulations on hypothetical or real world portfolios. Those portfolios are held
constant over time and no adjustments are assumed over the observation period. For
example, Ervin and Wilde (2001) start from a hypothetical portfolio of BBB-rated bor-
rowers. They conclude, that, in 1990, a bank with an initial capital ratio of 8% would
have seen its capital ratio fall to 6.8% under the IRB approach.6 A similar approach is
taken by Kashyap and Stein (2004) who base their simulation on a set of borrowers, which
had a public rating of S&P or KMV. Their results show that for an average portfolio the
increase in capital charges would have been in the range of 30% to 45% over the period
from 1998 to 2002. R¨
osch (2002) differentiates between the default risk effect and the tran-
sition risk effect. Using S&P's transition and default rates from 1982 to 2000 he concludes
that these effects may lead to an offset in capital requirements and, thus, Basel II might
be even less cyclical than the current accord. A different approach is taken by Carling,
Jacobson, Lind´
e, and Roszbach (2002) who directly estimate the quality distribution of a
credit portfolio from a larger Norwegian bank. They show that macroeconomic conditions
have a significant impact on borrowers' PD and thus on regulatory capital under the IRB
approach of Basel II.
Although empirical studies show that capital charges will vary significantly over the
business cycle for a fixed portfolio, it would be premature to assume a similar pattern for
a bank's actual capital ratio. In fact, banks might hold a certain capital buffer to offset
unexpected shortfalls in capital or increases in capital charges. A more recent study comes
from Barrios and Blanco (2000), who show that banks hold a positive capital cushion even
if economic capital is below the regulatory minimum.
Several studies tried to estimate the bank's optimal capital buffer. One early study
is from Marcus (1983) who set out to explain the dramatic decline of capital of U.S.
6Calculations were based on the proposed risk weight function as of 2001. As the risk weight function
has changed since, the effect is likely to be smaller.

commercial banks from 1961 to 1978. A recent study along this line is by Ayuso, P´
erez,
and Saurina (2004) who estimate the relationship between the Spanish business cycle
and the capital buffer held by Spanish commercial and savings banks. An interesting
application of capital buffer theories to Basel II is provided by Jokivuolle and Peura
(2001), who run simulations for different hypothetical portfolios to obtain estimates for
both capital charges and the capital buffer of a typical bank.
Two main conclusions can be drawn from the empirical and theoretical studies on
the cyclicality of minimum capital requirements and capital buffers: (i) Under Basel II,
capital requirements are likely to increase during economic downturns and decrease during
upturns. (ii) Capital buffers are generally positive, but there is no consensus on whether
they move in parallel or instead in reverse to the overall economic development.
As we mentioned above, it is important to distinguish between the pure cyclicality of
capital charges and capital ratios, on the one hand, and their pro-cyclical effect on the
macroeconomy, on the other. So far, little research has been carried out on the second
aspect. One exception is Blum and Hellwig (1995) who claim that minimum capital
requirements (with fixed risk weights) reinforce macroeconomic fluctuations. They derive
their theoretical results from a straightforward macroeconomic model which accounts for
regulatory constraints on banks' ability to lend. However, in our view, one drawback of
their model is the crude way it models the bank lending channel. This is one reason, why it
is unable to explain banks' capital buffer, ie. in this model minimum capital requirements
are always binding.
There is an ongoing debate among macroeconomists over the role of bank lending in the
propagation of business cycles and the transmission of monetary policy. In this context,
bank lending has a special role as a source of finance, which cannot be easily assumed by
decentralised capital markets.7
Traditional theories of the bank lending channel did not account for regulatory con-
straints on banks' ability to lend. In a recent theoretical paper Van den Heuvel (2002)
examines the role of bank lending in the transmission of monetary policy in the presence
of capital adequacy regulations. An interesting side aspect of his model is, that regulatory
constraints do not necessarily become binding, ie banks hold a positive capital buffer.
The present paper is organised as follows: In chapter 2 we present a simple model of the
banking industry. We introduce the regulatory framework and derive the target function

of a representative bank for its actual capital ratio. In chapter 3 we assess the cyclicality
of banks' capital ratio. The second part of the paper investigates the pro-cyclical effects
of capital requirements on the macroeconomy. Chapter 4 provides the macroeconomic
framework before we examine macroeconomic volatility under different regulatory regimes
in chapter 5. In chapter 6 we try to calibrate the model to real world data. Chapter 7
concludes.
2 A model of the banking sector
In our framework for the financial sector the banking industry can be described by a
representative bank. The bank can invest into two different assets: riskless bonds (B) and
loans (L), which are subject to default risk. The bank finances its investments through
equity capital (E) and customer deposits (D). We assume that the bank is unable to
raise additional equity capital, which seems a reasonable assumption for the short term
horizon we have in mind. Therefore, the only way the bank can increase its capital base
is by retained earnings. In addition, we presume that the amount of deposits is fully
determined by money demand.
In the sequel, we assume a time horizon of one period (usually one year). At the
beginning of that period the bank decides on its portfolio of loans and bonds. Its decision
depends on interest rates, which we denote by r and  for bonds and for loans respectively.
It also depends on the perceived credit risk of loans, since the bank takes into account
that a random fraction s of the borrowers defaults at the end of the period. For simplicity,
we assume that, if the borrower defaults, the bank must write off the total amount of
the loan.8 Hence, assuming that interest rates on bonds and loans are given by r and ,
respectively, and ignoring any interest payments on deposits, the profit or loss at the end
of the period is given by  = ( - s) L + r B. In table 1 we depict a bank's typical balance
sheet at the start and at the end of the period.
The bank is not fully free to determine the composition of its asset portfolio. Even in
the absence of any regulatory or reserve requirements, the bank must protect itself against
insolvency due to an unexpected loss in its loan portfolio. Usually a default is assumed
to occur when the bank's equity capital is used up. The bank is also bound by regulatory
constraints, which require that the regulatory capital ratio exceeds a threshold a. The
8Alternatively we may also assume a fixed, positive recovery rate, but that would not change the
subsequent analysis in a significant way.

regulatory capital is defined as the ratio of equity capital to risk weighted assets. Without
loss of generality, we assume that risk weighted assets are given by w ·L, with w being the
risk weight for loans (bond are weighted with 0). It is convenient to normalise the bank
balance sheet variables by L. Denoting the capital-loan ratio (CL-ratio) by e regulatory
constraints require that e exceeds a · w.
In our model, the regulatory requirements (e > w · a) are stricter than the solvency
requirements (e > 0). In fact, we argue that regulatory requirements shift the default point
from 0 to a · w · L. Because the default is associated with significant costs to the owner
or to the managerial board, the bank holds a positive capital buffer (CL-buffer) e - a w
against unexpected losses in its loan portfolio. However, holding a capital buffer is not
cost-free because, by investing in riskless bonds, the bank foregoes lending margins. For
the sake of simplicity we dispense with modelling the costs of default explicitly. Instead,
we assume that the bank tries to achieve a target probability of its own default p. A
conservative bank would target a small p, a bank with a large appetite for risk a large p.
The parameter p may be associated with a certain rating the bank tries to achieve.
In our model the bank derives its optimal portfolio of loans and bonds by maximising
expected profits under funding constraints and regulatory requirements. At the end of
the period the bank's equity capital is given by the banks initial capital plus or minus
any profits achieved or losses incurred during the course of the period. Since the loan loss
rate s is random the bank is unable to predict the realisation of s with certainty. We do
assume, however, that the bank knows its exact probability distribution.
Provided that the bank's target probability of default is given p the regulatory con-
straint can be written as:
P[e + /L < a w] = p (1)

In the appendix we derive the following expression for the bank's optimum CL-ratio:
e = k ( -  + r + ¯
s + w a) (2)
where k is a parameter which depends negatively on the bank's leverage ratio A
E
, and  is
an indicator of the bank's risk aversion.9.
Thus, the bank's CL-buffer is given by
 = e - w a = k ( -  + r + ¯
s) + (k - 1)w a (3)
Note that the CL-buffer is positive provided that the bank is sufficiently risk averse,
ie that its target probability of default p is small.10
The more risk averse the bank is, the higher it sets its CL-buffer. Apart from the
bank's risk aversion, the buffer also depends on interest rates. The bank will extend more
loans when loan interest rates rise and it will reallocate a greater portion of its funds
to bonds when the loan spread contracts. The relation of capital charges and capital is
depicted in figure 1.
Note that an increase in capital charges by one percentage point does not lead to an
increase in the capital buffer to the same amount. Instead it will increase by k percent.
If calibrated to real world data k takes values at around 0.5 (cf chapter 6)
9The parameter  depends negatively on p.
10Therefore we do not need to introduce an additional regulatory constraint for the start of the period.

3 The cyclical effects of capital requirements
As we stated above, we distinguish between the cyclical effects of capital requirements on
the bank's actual capital and their pro-cyclical effect on the macroeconomy. With respect
to the former, the cyclicality of capital has two aspects: the cyclicality of capital charges
and the cyclicality of the CL-buffer.
We do not examine the cyclicality of capital charges in greater detail here as it has
already been analysed extensively in the literature, in particular with regard to the new
Basel Accord. Instead we simply take for granted that credit risk is indeed subject to
cyclical variations. We therefore assume that the risk weight for loans depends on GDP,
which we denote by y:11
w = w(y), (4)
Furthermore we will assume a pro-cyclical effect of y on w:
wy(y) < 0, (5)
It simplifies the subsequent analysis if we impose the following linear structure on w(y),
ie
w(y) = w0 -
m
a
(y - y0) (6)
In equation (6), y0 and w0 may be interpreted as average production and the average
risk weight over the course of the business cycle. For our subsequent analysis it is necessary
to distinguish between two possible changes in the regulatory framework: a rise in the level
of capital charges and an increase in their risk sensitivity. Therefore we have stated the
slope of w in terms of a, in the case of which a rise in the capital threshold a does not
affect 
y
w a.
We now turn to the problem of the cyclicality of capital. In this context it is important
to distinguish between two related hypotheses, which have been stated in the literature.
The hypothesis of cyclical capital buffers holds, that banks decrease their capital ratio in an
economic upturn, or, by the same token, that banks increase their loan supply. The second
hypothesis, which is more important, claims that the stricter regulatory requirements are
the more pronounced the cyclical patterns of capital ratios or CL-buffers are.
11This relationship should be interpreted in a statistical sense. In the context of Basel II w is determined
the borrower's probability of default (PD), which itself depends on GDP: w = w(PD(y)). Furthermore y
might be interpreted as GDP growth or as output gap to account for time trends.
8
In our setting we define cyclicality of CL-ratios by the sensitivity of e with respect to
changes in production y. Since ky and sy may be assumed to be negative (cf Appendix)
we derive
ey = k(¯
sy - m) + e
ky
k
< 0 (7)
Therefore, the CL-ratio decreases in an economic upturn and decreases in an economic
downturn. In this sense, we can say that CL-ratios move cyclically.
It has been claimed in the literature that capital buffers absorb some of the volatility
in capital charges. However, in view of equation (7) this might not be the case. In fact
if m is small the CL-buffer might even add to the cyclicality of capital charges as can be
seen by the following equation:
y = k¯
sy + e
ky
k
+ (1 - k)m (8)
Note, that while the first two terms on the right hand side are negative the third term
is positive12, with the overall effect being ambiguous.
We now turn to the second hypothesis - whether or not capital requirements tend to
increase the volatility of CL-ratios. First, note that a bank will ceteris paribus increase
their CL-ratios if regulatory requirements increase. At the same time they will decrease
their CL-buffer:
ea = k w  0 (9)
a = (k - 1) w  0 (10)
However, although a bank decreases its CL-buffer in response to an increase in cap-
ital charges, this does not imply that the volatility of CL-ratios decreases. Quite to the
contrary, from equation (9) we derive:
eya = ky w0 < 0 (11)
Thus, an increase in a even reinforces the cyclical behaviour of the bank's CL-ratio e. This
is true even if risk weights are fixed and do not change over the course of the business
cycle. Note that the CL-buffer exhibits the same change in volatility as e, ie. ya = eya,
as we formulated risk weights in such a way that their sensitivity to changes in y is not
affected by an increase in a.
12Note that 0 < k < 1, cf Appendix.
9
Turning now to analysing an increase in m, it is not surprising that the cyclicality of
risk weights affects the cyclicality of CL-ratios. It is easily verified that
eym = -k < 0 (12)
In contrast to the case analysed in the previous paragraph, the CL-buffer does absorb
some of the volatility in capital charges. In fact,
ym = 1 - k > 0 (13)
To sum up, the following conclusion can be drawn from the analysis above: Banks
adjust their CL-ratio in a cyclical way and regulatory requirements, whether with fixed or
risk sensitive risk weights, are likely to increase the cyclicality of CL-ratios. More precisely,
both the level of capital charges (a) and the cyclicality of risk weights (m) tend to enhance
the cyclicality of capital-loan ratios. Wether or not CL-buffers add to the cyclicality of
CL-ratios, on top of the cyclicality of capital charges, depends on the slope of the risk
weight function. Only if risk weight exhibit a relatively strong sensitivity to risk does our
model predict a dampening effect of the CL-buffer.
Our results have important implication for the assessment of the cyclicality of Basel II.
First, one might overestimate the volatility of capital ratios if one looks at likely changes in
capital charges alone without taking account of capital buffers, which tend to absorb some
of the volatility. Second, the size of the capital buffer does not only depend on the riskiness
of loans and on the risk aversion of the bank but it also depends on the level of capital
charges and on their sensitivity to macroeconomic changes. In particular, according to
our findings, the CL-buffer is likely to have a dampening effect with regard to changes in
GDP if risk weights exhibit a relatively strong sensitivity to risk. They may increase the
cyclicality of CL-ratios if the risk sensitivity is small. Therefore, the prospective cyclicality
of capital under Basel II cannot be assessed, as was done in some analyses, by combining
capital charges of Basel II and capital buffers observed under the current framework.
4 The macroeconomic framework
In the preceding section we analysed to what extent the business cycle influences the
banks' capital and lending decisions. This is an important question but it is only one part
of a wider problem, since capital requirements can also influence the business cycle. To
analyse the feedback mechanism between the financial and the real sector of an economy
10
we need to build a model of the credit channel which takes the regulatory framework into
account. Our model, which is presented below, builds on standard models found elsewhere
in the literature.13
To simplify the analysis, we assume in our model that output is fully driven by real
demand. This is not a severe restriction as our model can easily be generalised to also
accommodate the supply side. In our model real demand yd depends on income y and
interest rates  and r respectively. The equilibrium state of the goods market is given by
y = yd(, r, y) (14)
The demand for deposits arises from the transaction motive and is a function of the
riskless rate r and income y. We assume, that total deposits are exogenous to the bank:
D = D(r, y) (15)
In the following we assume that the riskless interest rate r stays constant over time as
we assume no change of monetary policy. This allows us to analyse the cyclical effects of
capital regulation on the macroeconomy in isolation from any potential countermeasures
by the central bank. In contrast to the riskless interest rate, the loan rate is an endogenous
parameter, and its equilibrium value is determined on the credit market. Using Ld and
Ls to denote the loan demand and loan supply respectively, we give the market clearing
condition on the credit market by
Ld(, r, y) = Ls(, r, y). (16)
We can tie this in with chapter 2 to derive the representative bank's loan supply from
its target capital:
Ls = E · e-1 (17)
In addition to standard assumptions contained in standard macroeconomic models, loan
supply depends not only on interest rates and output but also on the regulatory framework
(cf equation 2). As regards loan demand, we do not impose any particular functional form
apart from standard assumption on the coefficients of elasticities.14
13One similar version, for example, can be found in Bernanke and Blinder (1988). However this model
does not account for capital requirements.
14That is, we assume Ls

to be negative (price effect) and Ls
y
to be positive (income effect). Ls
r
is assumed
to be positive since financial investments represent alternative investments to those in fixed assets, which
are financed by loans.
11
5 The pro-cyclical effect on the macroeconomy
When analysing the impact of capital regulatory requirements on bank lending and the
wider economy, it is important to distinguish between short and long-term effects.15 For
example, raising the level of capital charges will effect transitory adjustment measures of
banks, which in turn will influence the macroeconomy through the bank lending channel.
The effect will be the more pronounced the shorter the spell is between the announcement
of a regulatory change and its implementation. The impact can be significant, but even-
tually the economy will return to its long term growth path. However, although capital
requirements are unlikely to have permanent effects on growth per se, we argue that they
may have permanent effects on the volatility of bank lending and on the macroeconomy
as a whole.
A suitable way to address the volatility of production is by means of the demand mul-
tiplier, which measures the extent to which exogenous shocks in production are amplified
through the course of the business cycle.
Let us assume, for example, that the demand for output is perturbed by an amount .
The new output equilibrium is attained at
y = yd(, r, y) +  (18)
Differentiating (18) with respect to  now yields the well-known demand multiplier:
y = (1 - yd
y
- yd

y)-1 (19)
Under standard assumptions the multiplier is positive and larger than 1. The crucial
question is to what extent the multiplier depends on the level or on the structure of
capital requirements. By inspection of equation (19) it is clear that in our model capital
requirements can influence the multiplier only via the equilibrium loan interest rate. In
particular one needs to assess how y depends on the level and on the risk sensitivity of
capital charges ie. on a and m respectively. By virtue of equation (19), if y is a decreasing
function of a then an increase in a will have a pro-cyclical effect on the economy as a result
of a rise in the multiplier y. In contrast, if y depends positively on a the overall effect
on the economy will be anti-cyclical.
As we explained in section above, it is important to distinguish between short-term
and long-term effects of a change in capital charges. The short term effect of a rise in a
15This point is also stressed in Blum and Hellwig (1995).
12
will be a reduction in lending. In the longer term, however, banks will be able to raise
new capital to bring lending back to its initial level. Let us assume, as a useful working
hypothesis, that a is being increased by the amount a and, at the same time, the bank
is being compensated by an increase in its capital to the amount of E. By virtue of
equation (2), if E = e-1
0
k0 w0 E0 · a the bank will not change its lending. Therefore,
to isolate long term effects from transitory effects and to account for short term adaption
processes we will assume that Ea = k0 w0 rather than E being fixed.
The market clearing condition on the loan market is given by
Ls = Ld (20)
or, in logarithms
ln Ls = ln E - ln e = l (21)
where l = lnLs.
As regards loan demand, we assume that it is a function of interest rates and income
l = l(, r, y). Implicit differentiation of (21) yields
- e-1(ey + ey) = ly + ly (22)
 kya + k m - k sy -
ky
k
e = e(l y + e ly) (23)
 (k - le)ya = k w(ly + ly +
ky
k
) (24)
While the first term on the right-hand side is positive, the sign of the term on the
right hand-side is ambiguous. Note that ly + ly is the equilibrium loan growth, which
can be assumed to be positive. It is easy to show that ky
k
is equal to k r E-1 Dy, ie it is a
negative function of money growth. The sign ya depends on whether the "credit effect"
or the "money effect" is dominating. It is negative if equilibrium credit growth is strong
and positive if money growth dominates instead.
By comparison, a rise in m has an unambiguous effect on y. Implicit Differentiation
of equation (22) with respect to m yields:
ym = -
k
k - e l
< 0 (25)
What consequences do our findings so far have for the problem of pro-cyclicality?
One important result is that an increase in the level of capital charges does not nec-
essarily increase the cyclicality of y. This is in contrast with claims elsewhere in the
13
literature (cf Blum and Hellwig (1995). In fact, a rise in a may even have a dampening
effect on the volatility in production if the income elasticity of money demand is large.
The second finding is that an increase in the risk sensitivity of risk weights does indeed
have a visible pro-cyclical effect on the macroeconomy.
6 Calibration
In section 3 we analysed how macroeconomic fluctations influence banks' capital, while in
section 5 we studied the feedback mechanism from the financial sector to the real sector.
By means of a theoretical model of the banking sector and the bank lending channel, we
were able to show that regulatory capital requirements are important in this regard. Of
course, whether or not pro-cyclicality is significant in magnitude depends on the relevant
parameters. In the following we will investigate this issue in greater detail. It should be
clear from the beginning, though, that a full empirical analysis is not feasible (due to lack
of data) nor is it the aim of this paper, which is mainly focussed on the theoretical part
of the problem. However, although it is inappropriate to directly apply our model to real
world data, a first, albeit crude appraisal of the magnitude of the expected effects seems
feasible.
We first turn to the problem of the cyclicality of banks' capital and investigate the
effects of a rise in the level (a) and in the risk sensitivity of capital charges (m). As noted
in chapter 3 we measure cyclicality of capital-loan ratios by ey. In our baseline scenario
the regulatory threshold of the risk weighted capital ratio is given by 8%. We also assume
a decrease in GDP of dy = 1%. In the first scenario we assume a rise in a by da = .01,
while in the second scenario we assume a rise in m by dm = 0.08. Scenarios 1 and 2
are comparable in the sense that in both scenarios capital charges would increase by 1
percentage point over the course of the business cycle. From equations (11) and (12) we
deduce that a bank's capital would increase by
eya = ky w0 dy da (26)
eym = -k dy dm (27)
In the appendix we show that
k = 1 +
A
E
r
-1
(28)
14
Under reasonable assumption for the relevant parameters, 16 capital-loan ratios would
change by 0.03 percentage point in scenario 1 and 0.5 percentage point in scenario 2. Of
course, those estimates are rather crude and depend on the assumptions made. However,
what the calculations do show is that a rise in m leads to a much higher increase in
cyclicality as compared to a similar rise in a. Furthermore, the calculations also show,
that the buffer capital plays a crucial role in mitigating the cyclical effects of a rise in m.
In fact, it reduces cyclicality by roughly 50%.
We now turn to analysing the pro-cyclical effect of a rise in m on the macroeconomy.
We abstain from analysing a rise in a since the overall effect is ambiguous (cf previous
chapter). In any case it would be insignificant by magnitude from above discussion.
According to (19), a rise in m would lead to an increase in the multiplier
dy  yd

ym dm (29)
with
ym = -
k
k - e l
< 0 (30)
Since e and l are likely to be small as compared to k (which is approximately 0.5) one
can assume ym = -1. Therefore
dy  |yd

| dm (31)
In other words, the increase of the multiplier is approximately equal to the loan interest
rate sensitivity of GDP, or equivalently, to its loan spread sensitivity.
What do the above results tell us for the pro-cyclicality of Basel II? As mentioned
in the introduction, the major change which Basel II will bring about concerns the risk
sensitivity of capital charges. In the notation of our model it will change the value of m
from 0 to some positive amount m. As other research papers have pointed out, it is not
unrealistic to assume that a rise in GDP of 1 percent will decrease the capital charge by up
to 30 %.17. According to our analysis, the change in the capital ratio will be approximately
half that amount. The pro-cyclical effect on the macroeconomy largely depends on how
many banks adopt the advanced approach and how many the standardised approach. If
all banks followed the advanced approach, the average value for the risk sensitivity of
16r = 0.05, A/E = 20, Ay
/A = 0.1
17This estimate also complies with our own empirical analysis on loan loss default rates
15
capital charges m would be equal to approximately 0.2. But even under such an extreme
assumption, equation (31) shows that the effect on output volatility will be moderate
provided that y is smaller than 1. In fact, even if we assume a rather large value for the
interest elasticity of output, say 0.5 (with respect to one year) and if we assume that dm
is equal to 0.2, the demand multiplier would only increase by approximately 0.1. This
increase seems small when compared to the total size of the multiplier which is likely to
be within the range of 1 to 1.5.
7 Conclusion
Our paper contributes twofold to the existing literature on the pro-cyclicality of minimum
capital requirements. First, we address the problem by examining the effects on the banks'
capital buffer, whereas previous research has largely focussed on fluctuations in capital
charges alone. Second, we make a clear distinction between the cyclicality of regulatory
capital ratios, on the one hand, and its pro-cyclical effect on the real economy on the
other. We analyse the pro-cyclical effect on the macroeconomy by modeling a version of
the bank lending channel which explicitly takes the banks' capital decisions into account.
With regard to the cyclicality of the capital buffer we find that it is important to
distinguish between fixed and risk sensitive risk weights. If risk weights are fixed, the
capital buffer is likely to move anti-cyclically, ie it decreases in upturns and increases in
downturns. Furthermore, the influence of the level of capital charges on the capital buffer
is likely to be small. With risk sensitive risk weights, the picture can change completely.
If risk sensitivity is relatively large, then capital buffers are likely to move pro-cyclically.
In addition, the sensitivity of risk weights to risk changes can have a large impact on the
size of those fluctuations. This finding has important consequences for the analysis of
the prospective effects of Basel II. In view of our model, the regulatory framework is not
exogenous to the capital buffer. Therefore, it is illegitimate to analyse the behaviour of
capital under Basel II by simply adding today's capital buffer to future capital charges,
which some previous papers seem to have suggested.
When calibrated to real world data our findings suggest that the capital buffer indeed
plays a crucial role in mitigating the volatility in capital charges as it reduces cyclicality
of the actual capital ratio roughly by half when compared to the regulatory capital ratio.
As regards the pro-cyclical effect on the macroeconomy we find only a limited effect of a
16
change in capital charges on output.

Appendix
The target capital ratio
The bank's profit at the end of the period is given by
 = ( - s)L + rB (32)
where s is the random default rate, which has an expected value of ¯
s. We assume that
the distribution of the normalised default rate s - ¯
s is given by F.
Since profits are random, the bank might be unable to fulfil the regulatory requirements
if it runs out of capital. A default occurs if E +  < a w L. We assume that, when
determining its credit exposure, then bank sets itself a target probability of default p, ie
with probability p or less the bank's capital at the end of the period will be to low to meet
the regulatory requirements. In mathematical terms:
p := Prob(E +  < w a L) (33)
We assume that the bank maximises its expected profits E[] given its target proba-
bility of default PD = p and its funding condition B + L = D + E.
In equilibrium, the riskless rate r will be less than the net expected return on loans
 - ¯
s. Let us assume that r is larger than  - ¯
s. Since the profit function (32) of is
monotonously increasing in L and B, the bank will then invest all of its assets in riskless
bonds if r >  - ¯
s, which cannot happen in an equilibrium state of the loan market.
Because of the monotonicity of the profit function, the default constraint is binding for a
profit-maximising bank.
After replacing  by (32) in equation (33) and after some transformations, we derive
F (e +  + rb - w a - ¯
s) = p (34)
where F is the cumulative distribution function of s - ¯
s, and e denotes E/L and b denotes
B/L.
Thus
e +  + rb - w a - ¯
s =  (35)
where  = F-1(1 - p). Since b = eA
E
- 1 one gets
e = k( + w a -  + r + ¯
s) (36)
with k = 1 + A
E
r -1
