Abstract
This paper examines the effect of maternal socio-economic status in the household, such
as their autonomy, ability, freedom and bargaining power, on child birth registration in India
using the nationally representative India Human Development Survey-II (IHDS-II), 2011­
12. We have estimated a multilevel mixed effects model which accounts for the hierarchical
structure of the data and allows us to examine the effects of unobserved `district' and `com-
munity' characteristics along with individual child level characteristics on probability of birth
registration. The results show that between-districts and between individuals differences
share a considerably high and an almost equal proportion of the variations in probability of
birth registration in India. At individual child level, mother's socio-economic status such as
her ability to move around independently and her exposure to outside world, significantly
raise the probability of birth registration. More importantly, the marginal effects of the
maternal autonomy indicators: mother's ability to move around freely and her control over
resources, on birth registration vary across districts in India. Other variables such as institu-
tional birth, mother's antenatal care seeking behaviour, caste, religion, household wealth
and parental education are significant determinants of birth registration.
1. Introduction
Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) system have renewed momentum in the new
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) guidelines. CRVS is both a target in its own right and
fundamental for maternal and child health, social inclusion, access to education and health
services [1]. Civil registration is the way by which countries keep a continuous and complete
record of births and deaths. It is important at a national and state level for policy and planning
purposes. World Health Organisation (WHO) considers it as the most reliable source of statis-
tics. It is the birth right of each child to be registered and issued with a birth certificate [2].
Globally 35% of births go unaccounted for in registration [3]. The issue has been highlighted
as a scandal of invisibility where most people born in Africa and Asia die without leaving a
trace in any legal record or official statistic [4]. Over the past decade there has been a

significant shift in the literature from Who Counts? [4­7]. . .. . . to Counting Births and Deaths
[3, 8­10] that established the CRVS system as a necessary component of SDG.
Globally 230 million children under the age of five have never been recorded. More than
half (59%) live in Asia, and an estimated 71 million­one in three, live in India. Many barriers
prevent people from registering births and deaths. There are countries that do not have the
necessary system in place to make births and deaths registration mandatory whereas in other
countries only urban people have access to registration services. India has started its own
CRVS improvement initiatives and introduced the requisite legislative and administrative
reforms to improve civil registration. As a result, birth registration coverage increased from
60% in 2001 to more than 80% in 2010 but the process is still incomplete. Over the last two
decades, there has been significant emphasis on promoting access to Maternal and Child
Health (MCH) services in India while similar emphasis on completing birth registration has
been lacking. In the SDG era, where the goal is to promote access and equitable health for all
through Universal Health Coverage (UHC), universal birth registration needs to be prioritised.
Fagernas and Odame (2013) [11] note that birth registration systems would be useful in track-
ing progress towards health-related goals.
There is little empirical research so far to identify at individual birth and death registration
level--what exactly hinders the registration process in India. This paper is an important first
step that examines the individual, household, community and district level determinants of
birth registration using a multilevel hierarchical mixed model. In India, the process of birth
registration is based on informant reporting structure, where the primary responsibility lies on
individual informants who report birth. It can be the head of the household in case of home
events and institutional heads in case of institutional deliveries. Under such circumstances,
where only 13% (84%) of pregnant women in the poorest (the richest) population quintile
delivered in health facilities in 2005 [12, 13], it is important to focus on the relative significance
of individual, household, community and district level enabling factors in determining the reg-
istration of a birth.
This paper analyses `if independent and informed mothers are more likely to register their
children in India'. Many mothers lack the knowledge on how to register a child's birth [2] and
consequently are unaware of what it entails and delivers to their child. The status of birth regis-
tration would significantly improve across the world if women were educated, well informed
and independent given their role as primary caregivers for children. However, women con-
tinue to have little household decision-making authority in many developing countries includ-
ing India. Improvements in maternal socio-economic status have been strongly linked in the
literature to better educational and demographic outcomes, improved child welfare and alloca-
tion of household resources in favour of children' [14­18]. UNICEF (2013) [2] notes that
mothers with some schooling are more likely to know how to register a child than their unedu-
cated peers. In India, birth registration levels increase with mothers' education.
2. Methods
2.1 Study design and data source
We used the latest round of the India Human Development Survey-II (IHDS-II), 2011­12 for
our analysis. IHDS-II is a nationally representative, multi-topic survey of 42,152 households in
1,503 villages and 971 urban neighbourhoods across India. The survey collects a wide range of
information on household health, education, employment, economic status, marriage, fertility,
gender relations, social capital, village infrastructure, wage levels, and panchayat composition.
IHDS-II is the most up-to-date household survey available on India. Also, it contains a com-
prehensive set of information on gender relations and women status in the household such as

their autonomy, ability, freedom, exposure to information and bargaining power that allows
us the unique opportunity to study the relationship between these variables and child birth
registration in India.
Our sample contains information on 9333 children less than 5 years old in 31 states, 367
districts and 2189 villages/neighborhoods. India is a large country with 31 states and 5 union
territories. Those are subdivided into 686 districts and districts into a few more layers of
administrative units. The Maternal and Child Health (MCH) care is implemented through the
Department of Family Welfare (DFW) mostly at the district and sub-district levels through dif-
ferent levels of health care delivery systems e.g. Subcentres (SCs), Primary Health Centres
(PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs) and District Hospitals. Previous studies have
found significant disparities in MCH service coverage and efficiency differences in service
delivery across districts in India [19, 20]. Therefore, along with individual and household level
characteristics, we have considered villages/neighborhoods and districts as the other two
higher levels of analysis in a mixed effects hierarchical model as policies and service provisions
at these levels might influence birth registration. We have included state level covariates at the
individual level analysis.
2.2 Methodology
We use multilevel models to take account of the hierarchical or clustered structure of the data.
For example, children who live in the same household are more likely to have similar outcomes
for birth registration than children randomly chosen from the population at large. Households
are further nested within communities with children living in the same communities facing
the same set of cultural and institutional barriers and enabling factors for birth registration
than those living in other communities. Communities are also nested within higher adminis-
trative units such as districts with children living in the same districts likely to share similar
policy and health care infrastructure than those living in other districts. However, our analysis
does not consider multiple children from the same household because the birth registration
information in the data pertains to the mother's last birth only [21­24].
Our dependent variable in the study is a binary response variable with a value 1 `if the child
has a birth certificate' and 0 otherwise. It is based on the survey response to the question `if the
mother possesses a birth certificate for her last birth that occurred in the last 5 years (i.e. since
January 2005)'.
Our explanatory variables are grouped into three levels to reflect the hierarchical nature of
the data. Level 1 variables correspond to child/household/maternal characteristics with com-
munity and state level contextual covariates. Level 2 variables correspond to community as a
random effect and community/village level characteristics as random slopes and Level 3 corre-
sponds to district as a random effect and some of child level maternal characteristics as ran-
dom slopes. We run a three level mixed effects random slope logit model.
We started our estimation by running two mixed effects logit null models with no covari-
ates [24]. The first null model introduces a random intercept component at Level 3 (district
level) while the second introduces an additional random intercept term at Level 2 (community
level). Then, we introduce state, community, maternal, household and child level covariates
with one slope coefficient at Level 2 and two slope coefficients at Level 3 in a step wise manner
following forward selection in a three level mixed effects random slope logit model. The aim
here is to study any variations in the null models that were due to each of the confounding
factors.
The corresponding equations for the two null and full mixed effect models are presented
below [24]. The first null model, a mixed effects binary response logit model with a random

2.3 Explanatory variables
This research is conceptually aligned to the literature on maternal and child health (MCH)
which focuses on factors influencing the utilisation of maternal and new born health services
(in low and middle-income countries). The factors associated with the utilisation of MCH

related services (such as prenatal, delivery and postnatal services) are unlikely to be different
from those that influence birth registration decision in the period following the birth of a
child. The literature identifies a number of factors that are associated with the utilisation of
such services including: lack of education (i.e., mother's and husband's education level); lack
of decision-making authority (i.e., women's authority and autonomy); socio-economic barri-
ers (i.e., low household living standards, low household income, no insurance coverage); social
class structure and religion (i.e., religion and caste of the household); limited access to health-
care facilities (i.e., transportation); geographical location (i.e., distance to health care facilities);
and lack or shortage of trained and skilled health care professionals (i.e., capacity and knowl-
edge of skilled health care professionals) [25].
Some recent studies on determinants of birth registration have highlighted the association
between child, household and community level sociodemographic and economic factors and
birth registration. Amo-Adjei and Annim (2015) [26] find that mother's education, household
wealth and urban residence are positively associated with the likelihood that a child is regis-
tered in Ghana. Religion is also found to be a significant determinant of birth registration with
children whose parents practice a traditional religion at a significant risk of not being regis-
tered. There is also evidence of significant regional effect with children from eastern region of
Ghana less likely to be registered [26]. Okunlola et al. (2017) [27] similarly find that birth regis-
tration increases with household wealth index and educational attainment of the mother in
Nigeria. It is also noted that lack of access to registration services and indirect costs associated
with registration contribute to low birth registration. According to Chereni (2016) [28], social
and cultural factors are equally important in influencing birth registration as economic factors
in Zimbabwe. And birth registration is viewed as an outcome that results from the interaction
between economic, non-economic, personal and structural factors. Isare and Atimati (2015)
[29] advocate for a community based approach where birth registration centers are established
within communities to increase accessibility and awareness about the benefits of birth registra-
tion. Our study controls for a comprehensive list of variables associated with birth registration
in the wider literature and in India (in particular) [25].
As noted above, our explanatory variables are grouped into three levels. The variables at
Level 1 correspond to child/household/maternal characteristics with village/community level
and state level contextual covariates. The child level attributes include--child's age as a contin-
uous variable and dummy variables representing institutional/non-institutional place of birth
and gender of the child. Parental level attributes included are--mother's age and educational
level of both parents as continuous variables, and categorical variables representing mother's
self-assessed health status. Mother's migrant status representing mother's childhood place of
residence (i.e. if the mother's natal family resides in the same village/town or another) and
mother's Ante Natal Care (ANC) seeking behavior, in particular, if the mother had four or
more ANC visits during her last pregnancy are also included. We have also included a variable
representing the proportion of children who have died out of the total children ever born to
the mother at the time of the survey.
More importantly, we have included a wide range of variables representing gender relations
and mother's social and economic status in the household such as mother's role in household
decision making, her control over household resources, her ability to independently visit
places of need, her freedom of movement and bargaining capacity in the household. Under-
standing how women's autonomy, ability and freedom at the household level are associated
with birth registration and how factors at the community or higher sociopolitical level (such as
districts) moderate this relationship is an important contribution of this research. Previous
studies have highlighted the positive influence of maternal autonomy on feeding practice,
birth weight and infant growth in India [30 ­32]. It is also noted in the literature that maternal

autonomy could increase self-motivation and bring about behavioral change that would
improve the welfare of the mother and her family. A systematic review by Upadhyay et al.
(2014) [33] finds a positive association between women's empowerment and lower fertility,
longer birth intervals, and lower rates of unintended pregnancy.
Methodologically, Upadhyay et al. (2014) [33] highlighted the importance of choosing
appropriate measures that better approximate women's empowerment. It was further noted
that studies that used multiple and multidimensional measures of empowerment were more
likely to find consistent results. Shroff et al. (2011) [31] conducted a confirmatory factor
analysis to develop multiple dimensions of maternal autonomy. They find that individual
dimensions of autonomy could operate differently to influence child growth and wellbeing.
Accordingly, we identified 20 variables in our dataset that described mother's autonomy, abil-
ity, freedom, exposure to information/other resources and bargaining power in the household
[32, 34, 35] and conducted factor analysis to summarize and identify any common underlying
theme. Our analysis clearly identified four different underlying constructs or factors in these
variables and depending on the nature and category of the variables clubbing under each of
these factors we have named Factor 1 as `Mother's Autonomy', Factor 2 as `Mother's Ability',
Factor 3 as `Mother's Freedom in Movement' and Factor 4 as Mother's Bargaining Capacity.
However, three variables that we identify as mother's exposure to outside world did not group
into any of these four factors and we have decided to include them independently in the
model. The set of variables grouped under each factor, their rotated factor loadings (pattern
matrix), unique variances and the three independent mother's exposure variables are listed in
Table 1 below.
The household level variables that we control for include urban-rural residence, household
wealth status captured using wealth quintiles, caste and religious affiliation of the household.
We also control for state level contextual covariates in our regression:--health expenditure as a
percentage of Net State Domestic Product (NSDP), per capita public expenditure on health, lit-
eracy rate, gross enrolment rate, infant mortality rate and a dummy variable identifying the
low-income states in India. The state level variables were all extracted from the Economic Sur-
vey 2012­13 [36] and publication from National Health Accounts Cell [37].
At Level 2, we have controlled for the community/village level random effects and a random
slope for proportion of institutional births in the village. Additionally, village/community
level variables are included as Level 1 contextual covariates in the model. These include village/
community level mean years of schooling, proportion of institutional births and quintiles of
median per capita household consumption expenditures. Given that IHDS-II used cluster
sampling, all community level variables were created by aggregating relevant individual survey
responses at the clusters.
At Level 3, we have controlled for the district level random effects and random slopes for
two maternal socio-economic status summary variables representing Mother's Autonomy and
Ability. Previous studies have highlighted the need to account for the influence of communities
and broader socio-political environment on women's empowerment. It is documented that an
individual woman's empowerment process is simultaneously shaped by individual, social, cul-
tural and political forces [34]. This calls for multilevel modelling to analyse the complex interac-
tions between women empowerment measures at individual and at higher than the individual
level [33, 38]. All continuous variables in our model are centered at their mean values.
2.4 Descriptive statistics
A summary statistics of the variables is presented in Table 2. Table 2 shows that over 62 per
cent of children in our sample have birth certificates. The average age of children is 2.19 years

and 55 percent are male. Also, over 71 percent of children in the sample were born in an
institution.
Mothers' characteristics reveal that the average mother is 28 years of age and had received
around 6 years of schooling. Moreover, over 80 percent of mothers self-assess their health sta-
tus as good or very good. Only 45 percent of mothers have received the recommended 4 and
above ANC check-ups during their last pregnancy. The summary statistics of the mother's
socio-economic status related factor variables­namely, mother's autonomy, mother's ability,
mother's freedom of movement and mother's bargaining capacity are presented in the table.
In addition, the variables representing mother's exposure to the outside world reveal 29 per
cent of mothers in the sample have been to a metropolitan city, another state or abroad in the
past five years. In contrast, a larger proportion--about 62 percent--state that they have gone
out on family outings while 57 percent maintain that they often engage in discussions with
their husbands on various topics including work, community and politics.

Table 2 also presents that around 81 percent of households in the sample are Hindus. In
terms of caste affiliation, `other backward castes' make up 41 percent of our sample while
`Scheduled castes and tribes' account for 33 percent and `Brahmin and other forward' castes 25
percent. Only 6 percent of sampled households reside in `metropolitan urban areas' with 41
percent coming from `less developed villages', 29 percent from `more developed villages' and
24 percent from `other urban areas'.
3. Discussion of results
We have estimated a couple of null models in the beginning. The first null model is estimated
with only district-level random effects and the second null model with both district-level
and village/community level random effects. The results from these models are presented in
Table 3. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in model 1 indicates that 46.7 percent of

the total variation in birth registration in India lies between districts while the remaining 53.3
percent lies within-districts. Fig 1 below shows a caterpillar plot of the residuals for all 367 dis-
tricts in the sample from model 1 together with 95% confidence intervals. For a substantial
number of districts, the 95% confidence interval does not overlap with the horizontal line at
zero, indicating that birth registration coverage in these districts is significantly above average
(above the zero line) or below average (below the zero line) [Also see 24].
As within-district differences account for most of the variation in birth registration, we
looked at the effect of village/community level differences within districts on birth registration
in model 2. The ICC from model 2 indicates that 44 percent of the variation in birth registra-
tion is explained by between district differences while between community differences account
for 11 percent and within community differences for 45 percent of the variation.
As noted above, within-community differences [i.e. differences at the household and indi-
vidual level] account for most of the variation in birth registration within-districts. We, there-
fore, estimate a comprehensive model which controls for household and individual child level
covariates at level 1 including mother's social and economic status, state and community level
contextual characteristics. We also allow for two random slopes at the district level for moth-
er's social and economic status indicators­namely, mother's autonomy and mother's ability. A
random slope at the community level is also included for `proportion of institutional delivery
at the village level'. The results from estimation of this model are shown in Table 4.
Our primary focus of analysis in this paper is the variables representing mother's social and
economic status and bargaining power in the household. The summary variable (estimated
using factor analysis) representing `mother's ability' is significantly associated with birth regis-
tration. Mothers that are able to visit health centres, friends/relatives, a local shop or travel
short distance by train/bus on their own are more likely to have their children registered. This
variable reflects the mother's capacity to leave the house unaccompanied and move around

without needing a chaperon. Higher maternal mobility is related to greater decision-making
ability within the household [39]. As primary caregivers for children, mothers' ability to move
around is crucial for a number of activities that enhance the welfare of children such as immu-
nisation, health check-ups, and possibly birth registration [40]. A mother who is capable of
moving around on her own can also register the birth of her children without depending on
the husband. We can also see that the random slope coefficient for `mother's ability' [included
at the district level] is statistically significant. This shows that the marginal effect of `mother's
ability' on birth registration is not constant but varies across Indian districts. Moreover, the
negative covariance estimate between the intercept and mother's ability variable indicates that
districts with above average birth registration tend to have a flatter than average slope or below
average effects of maternal ability.
We also find that two other variables which represent mother's exposure to outside world­
namely, whether the mother had been to a metro/another state/abroad in the last 5 years; and
whether she had gone out on family outings- are significant determinants of birth registration.
In particular, having a mother who had been to a metro/another state/abroad increases the
odds of birth registration by a factor of 1.18. A mother travelling to another state or abroad sig-
nifies [that she enjoys] more autonomy in the household [39]. And undertaking such travels
present the opportunity to interact with various people and come across different ideas that
could enhance the wellbeing of children. Similarly, having a mother that had gone out on
family outings to cinemas or restaurants increases the odds of birth registration by a factor of
1.14, which is probably reflecting an already empowered mother with a relatively higher bar-
gaining power in the household or ability to positively influence decisions concerning children
[including that of birth registration].
Additionally, we had included a random slope coefficient for `mother's autonomy' at the
district level. The `mother's autonomy' variable shows mother's decision-making power on
issues such as purchase of property/land, wedding expenses, what to do if a child falls sick and
whom the child should marry. A mother that enjoys a greater degree of `autonomy' would
have greater access and control over economic resources in the household. It is documented in
the literature that autonomous mothers would allocate more resources towards their children
[41, 42]. Thus, mothers with control over resources would be more likely to register their chil-
dren by bearing the direct and indirect costs that might be involved in the birth registration
process. The random slope coefficient for this maternal autonomy variable at district level has
come out as statistically significant indicating that the marginal effect of this variable signifi-
cantly varies across districts. It may be reflecting the extent of regional diversity in gender rela-
tions in India. Previous studies have shown significant spatial and socio-cultural differences in
various dimensions of women's empowerment across regions in India [43]. For example, it
has been argued that women in South India have more voice in family life, more freedom of
movement and exposure to the outside world than their counterparts in North India [44].
Gutpa and Yesudian (2006) [43], on the other hand, found that states situated in central part
of India (such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Orissa) had low
empowerment of women. Given the spatial (and socio-cultural) differences in India, our find-
ings highlight that policy initiatives to increase birth registration (or even women's autonomy
for that matter) should be designed by taking district (regional) idiosyncrasies into account.
Among the child specific factors included in the regression, place of birth of child is statisti-
cally significant. The odds of birth registration increase by a factor of 4.6 for a child who has
had an institutional birth. We can also see that institutional delivery has one of the largest
impacts on the likelihood of birth registration in our model. The high likelihood of registration
for institutionally delivered children can be attributed to the fact that the reporting of such
births to the `Registrar of Births and Deaths' is the responsibility of the medical officer in
Maternal autonomy and birth registration in India

charge. More importantly, medical officers who attend the birth of a child are obligated to
report the incidence to the Registrar [45]. Brito et.al (2013) [46] also find high probability of
registration for institutionally delivered children in Latin America and the Caribbean. Our
results do not show any significant difference in the odds of birth registration between boys
and girls. A multivariate analysis by UNICEF (2005) [47] identifying the determinants of birth
registration across 63 countries also concluded that gender is insignificant. Age of child is
another significant determinant with the odds of registration increasing with age. Turning to
the household and other mother level factors in our model, we see that parental education is
positively associated with the likelihood of birth registration. An increase in the mother's
(father's) years of schooling by one year raises the odds that a child will get registered by a fac-
tor of 1.05 (1.03). The positive association between maternal education and birth registration
had also been established in other countries [Also see 26, 46]. Harding et.al (2015) [48] investi-
gate the transmission channels through which maternal education affects child outcomes, in
particular their academic achievement. One channel explored is social capital with educated
mothers more likely to be part of a social network of other educated people who possess the
knowledge, skills and resources beneficial for children. Thus, educated mothers can be
expected to receive valuable information and advice on various aspects of a child's life [includ-
ing the benefits of birth registration]. The positive effect of father's education may also be a
result of similar benefits from father's social capital.
Mother's number of antenatal visits at last pregnancy is another significant variable posi-
tively associated with birth registration. The odds of birth registration for mothers who have
had four or more antenatal check-ups is 2.18 times that of mothers who have had no check-up.
Antenatal care provides pregnant women with education, counselling, screening and treat-
ment to ensure mother and foetus remain in good health [49]. Moreover, antenatal visits
would increase the mother's awareness of what to expect after the birth of a child by providing
information on postpartum care, including breastfeeding, immunisation, and (quite possibly)
the importance of birth registration [50].
Our results also indicate that household wealth is significantly associated with birth regis-
tration. The odds of birth registration for households in the top wealth quintile is 1.49 times
that of households in the bottom quintile. Other cross-country studies have also established
the positive impact of wealth status on birth registration [2, 47]. This might be capturing the
possibility that households in lower wealth quintiles are put off birth registration by the late fee
that applies for children not registered within 21 days of birth. Office of the Registrar General
(2010) [45] also notes that births not registered after 30 days but within a year can be registered
on production of an affidavit and permission from the prescribed authority on top of the pre-
scribed late fee. Amo-Adjei and Annim (2015) [26] had demonstrated that late fee was a bar-
rier for registration in Ghana. There might also be indirect costs such as cost of transportation
or income lost due to time away from work which might hinder poorer households from hav-
ing their children registered [2]. Also, it might simply be the fact that poor households fail to
realise the long term benefits of registering their child birth.
Moreover, the dummy variable for religious background shows that the odds of birth regis-
tration for a child born in a Muslim family is 0.80 times that of a child born in a Hindu family.
The public health literature in India which has examined the Hindu-Muslim differences in fer-
tility planning may shed some light into this result. There are studies that indicate higher level
of unmet need for family planning among Muslims [51]. Singh et. al (2012) [52] also find that
utilisation of safe delivery care was significantly lower among Muslim women than women
from other religions in India. It has also been pointed out that mistrust of government family
planning programs and clinics may prevent Muslims from availing themselves of family plan-
ning services [51]. In another context, Hussain et. al (2014) [53] attribute the significant
Maternal autonomy and birth registration in India
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0194095 March 13, 2018 14 / 19
Hindu-Muslim disparity in the incidence of Polio to Muslim mistrust of the Polio eradication
program in India, which in his view may be rooted in the socio-political and historical context
of the country. Similar factors may be at play here making Muslims less likely to register their
children than Hindus.
We also find that a child belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) or
other castes has a lower probability of registration compared to the Forward/General castes.
Since India's independence in 1947 the social caste structure has been identified as a significant
hindrance for the socioeconomic development of minority groups. Despite government effort
to empower lower caste groups and minorities, significant disparities across all indicators of
development continue to exist. Studies indicate that social caste structure in India is a signifi-
cant predictor for safe delivery and post-natal care utilization with women from Scheduled
Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) less likely to access such services [52]. Thus, it is not
surprising that we also find women from these minority groups are less likely to register their
children given their less inclination to access post-natal and other services. Nevertheless, fur-
ther research needs to establish whether this is due to some cultural practice or lack of proper
knowledge or awareness in these communities. There is similar evidence from Ghana that
members of minority ethnic or religious groups are less likely to register compared to majori-
ties [47].
Among the community level factors included in our model, mean years of schooling and
proportion of institutional delivery come out as significant. An increase in mean years of
schooling by one year is associated with 1.1-fold increase in the odds of birth registration.
Thus, education is important not only at the household level but also at the community level.
Living in a community with a higher proportion of institutional births also raises the probabil-
ity of birth registration. These results point out that there are advantages that spill over to the
individual/household from living in a community with high mean years of schooling and insti-
tutional delivery. We have included a random slope coefficient for proportion of institutional
delivery at community level to allow for the effect of this variable (on birth registration) to vary
across communities in India but this didn't come out as significant.
Living in non-low income states has the largest positive effect on birth registration in our
regression. The odds of birth registration for a child living in a non-low income state is 9.2
times that of a child living in low income state. This might be reflecting the poor state of health
and other infrastructure leading to poor service delivery in low income states in India. Chotia
and Rao (2015) [54] note that `. . ..low income (BIMARU) states. . .. . .still lack basic health
infrastructure in many of their villages and towns leading to low positions in health index
rankings'. The gross enrolment ratio at the state level is also significant and is associated with a
higher birth registration. However, health expenditure as percentage of state GDP negatively
affects birth registration. This result might be capturing the possibility that national birth cer-
tificate campaigns to raise birth registration in India may have largely targeted those states
where health expenditure as a percentage of GDP is lower.
4. Conclusion
This paper examines the determinants of birth registration in India using a multilevel hierar-
chical mixed model. In particular, we looked at mother's autonomy, ability and bargaining
power within the household and its significance for child birth registration. The rationale
behind using a multilevel mixed effects model is the hierarchical nature of the data in that
child and households are nested within communities, which in turn are nested within districts.
The estimation results provide us with useful policy implications to increase birth registration
in India. Our results show that 45 percent of the variation in birth registration in India lies

between individual level differences and 44 percent lies between district level differences and
remaining 11 percent lies between community level differences. This brings the policy focus
on individuals and districts for targeting birth registration. At individual level the results indi-
cate that the summary variable representing mother's ability increases the probability of birth
registration. Ability to move around independently is an important trait for the mothers
because such mothers do not have to wait for their husbands to take their children for immu-
nisation, health check-ups, birth registration. . .etc. Two variables representing mother's expo-
sure to outside world [i.e. whether the mother had been to a metro/another state/abroad in the
last 5 years; and whether she had gone out on family outings] are also significant. So, mothers
that have better bargaining power in the household and are exposed to liberating and progres-
sive ideas from their surrounding that they could use to advance children's welfare are more
likely to register the birth of their children. Again, random slopes at the district level for two
indicators of mother's bargaining power- namely, mother's ability and mother's autonomy-
came out as significant confirming that while these variables significantly influence birth
registration, the level of their influence varies across districts in India. So, policies targeting
to empower mothers to improve maternal and child health outcomes and birth registration
should have a district level focus.
Our estimates further showed that institutional delivery is a highly significant determinant
which increases the probability of birth registration. This is consistent with a priori expectation
as medical officers presiding over delivery are duty bound to report the birth. The number of
mother's antenatal visits also came out as significant, which is not surprising given that moth-
ers will also get advice on postpartum care when they access antenatal services. Finlayson and
Downe (2013) [55] note that costs of visiting antenatal facilities (even when antenatal services
are provided for free) are the major reason behind low access to antenatal care in India (as in
other low and middle income countries). The Janani Suraksha Yojana cash transfer program
in India, where pregnant women are given a small sum of money to attend antenatal care and
deliver in a recognised health care facility has had a significant success in increasing antenatal
attendance [55]. Such cash transfer programs with a view to encouraging women's attendance
of antenatal care should be continued and extended to include birth registration given the suc-
cess of the Janani Suraksha Yojana program.
Robertson (2013) [56] notes that cash transfer programmes are an increasingly popular
approach to meet health and development needs of vulnerable children. For example, the con-
ditional cash transfer program rolled out in Mexico under PROGRESA led to increased pre-
ventative care, including prenatal care and child nutrition monitoring, and higher school
enrolment [57]. In the African context, a social cash transfer program in Malawi reduced child
morbidity and increased school enrolment. Similar benefits had also been observed in Kenya
and South Africa. More importantly, Robertson et al (2013) [56] found that conditional cash
transfers led to increase in the proportion of children with birth certificates in Zimbabwe. Bar-
uah et al (2013) [58] similarly established the positive impact of conditional cash transfer on
the birth registration of female children in Assam India. Under the conditional cash transfer
scheme, known as Majoni scheme, girls born after February 1, 2009 get 5000 rupees deposited
in a bank account given institutional delivery of the female child and compulsory registration
among other things. The scheme resulted in an increase in the formal request to have female
children registered from 24 percent to 39 percent [58].
Our study also established that probability of birth registration increases by wealth quintile.
The direct and indirect costs associated with the process of registration may discourage house-
holds in lower wealth quintiles from having children registered. We also find disadvantaged
groups such as Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) or other castes have a lower
