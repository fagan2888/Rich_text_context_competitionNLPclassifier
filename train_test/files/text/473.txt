Objectives: To assess motives for nonmedical use of pre-
scription opioids among US high school seniors and ex-
amine associations between motives for nonmedical use
and other substance use behaviors.
Design: Nationally representative samples of US high
school seniors (modal age 18 years) were surveyed dur-
ing the spring of their senior year via self-administered
questionnaires.
Setting: Data were collected in public and private high
schools.
Participants: The sample consisted of 5 cohorts (2002-
2006) of 12 441 high school seniors.
Main Outcome Measures: Self-reports of motives for
nonmedical use of prescription opioids and substance use
behaviors.
Results: More than 1 in every 10 high school seniors
reported nonmedical use of prescription opioids and 45%
of past-year nonmedical users reported "to relieve physi-
cal pain" as an important motivation. The odds of heavy
drinking and other drug use were lower among non-
medical users of prescription opioids motivated only by
pain relief compared with nonmedical users who re-
ported pain relief and other motives and those who re-
ported non­pain relief motives only. The odds of medi-
cal use of prescription opioids were lower among
nonmedical users who reported only non­pain relief mo-
tives compared with other types of nonmedical users.
Conclusions: The findings indicate motives should be
considered when working with adolescents who report
nonmedical use of prescription opioids. Future efforts
are needed to identify adolescents who may need appro-
priate pain management and those at increased risk for
prescription opioid abuse.

PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS ARE THE
foundation for the treat-
ment of acute and chronic
pain and these medications
are highly efficacious when
used properly.1 However, the nonmedi-
cal use of prescription opioids has in-
creased significantly among adolescents
and young adults over the past decade in
the United States.2-5 The National Survey
on Drug Use and Health, the Monitoring
the Future (MTF) study, and the Na-
tional Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol
and Related Conditions represent 3 of the
largest national drug studies in the United
States.2,3,6,7 While these 3 studies use dif-
ferent measures to assess nonmedical use
of prescription opioids, each measure in-
cludes nonprescribed use of scheduled opi-
oid analgesics. The past-year nonmedical
use of prescription opioids is most preva-
lent among young adults aged 18 to 25
years in the United States.4,6-8 In 2006, the
number of persons 12 years or older who
initiated nonmedical use of prescription
opioids within the past 12 months was
greater than the estimated numbers of
those who initiated marijuana or cocaine
use.8 Despite the high incidence and preva-
lence increases in nonmedical use of pre-
scription opioids, considerable gaps in
knowledge remain because most studies
fail to distinguish between individuals who
use someone else's prescription opioids for
self-treatment (ie, to relieve physical pain)
and those who use someone else's pre-
scription opioids for motives other than
self-treatment, such as to get high.9
Two recent school-based studies sug-
gest self-treatment motivates a substan-
tial proportion of those adolescents and
young adults who engage in nonmedical
use of prescription opioids.10,11 Indeed, the
most prevalent motive endorsed by sec-
ondary and postsecondary students who
reported nonmedical use of prescription
opioids was "to relieve pain" (79% in the
secondary student sample and 63% in the

postsecondary student sample). Those nonmedical us-
ers who reported "to relieve pain" as their sole motive
had fewer drug-related problems than other nonmedi-
cal users.10,11 Furthermore, 1 study showed the odds of
drug-related problems did not differ between nonmedi-
cal users who reported to relieve pain as their sole mo-
tive and those individuals who did not engage in non-
medical use of prescription opioids.11
Adolescence represents a particularly important devel-
opmental period to understand motives for nonmedical
use of prescription opioids because individuals who ini-
tiate nonmedical use of prescription opioids at or before
18 years of age are more likely to develop prescription opi-
oid use disorders than those who initiate later in life.12 Ex-
amining the motives for nonmedical use of prescription
opioids and related substance use behaviors in a national
sample of high school seniors in the United States would
help identify nonmedical users who may need appropri-
ate pain management and those at increased risk for drug
abuse. Improving the knowledge base regarding motives
for nonmedical use of prescription opioids is critical for
informing clinical practice and designing effective pre-
vention efforts. The objectives of the present study were
to assess (1) the prevalence of motives for nonmedical use

of high school seniors in the United States and (2) the as-
sociations between motives for nonmedical use of pre-
scription opioids and substance use behaviors and medi-
cal use of prescription opioids.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN
The MTF study annually surveys a cross-sectional, nationally rep-
resentative sample of high school seniors in approximately 135
public and private schools in the coterminous United States.3 The
MTF study uses a multistage sampling procedure. In stage 1, geo-
graphic areas or primary sampling units are selected; in stage 2,
schools within primary sampling units are selected (with prob-
ability proportionate to class size); and in stage 3, students within
schools are selected. The student response rates for high school
seniors ranged from 82% to 83% between 2002 and 2006. Be-
cause so many questions are included in the MTF study, much
of the questionnaire content is divided into 6 different question-
naire forms that are randomly distributed. This approach results
in 6 virtually identical subsamples. The measures relevant for this
study (eg, motives for nonmedical use of prescription opioids)
were asked on Form 1, so this study focuses on the subsamples
receiving Form 1 within each cohort. Institutional review board
approval was granted for this study by the University of Michi-
gan Institutional Review Board, Health Sciences.
SAMPLE
Approximately 12 441 individuals completed Form 1 in the 5 co-
horts between 2002 and 2006 during the spring of their senior
yearandtheserespondentscomposethestudysample.Thesample
was 53% female, 62% white, and 10% African American, and 28%
were from other racial groups or did not specify their race. The
modal age of the individuals in the sample was 18 years.
MEASURES
Nonmedical use of prescription opioids was assessed with a se-
ries of items asking respondents on how many occasions (if any)
they used prescription opioids on their own, without a doc-
tor's orders (eg, Vicodin, OxyContin, Percodan, Percocet, De-
merol, Dilaudid, morphine, opium, codeine). Respondents were
asked about nonmedical use in their lifetime and the past 12
months. The response scale for these items included (1) no oc-
casions, (2) 1 to 2 occasions, (3) 3 to 5 occasions, (4) 6 to 9
occasions, (5) 10 to 19 occasions, (6) 20 to 39 occasions, and
(7) 40 or more occasions.
Motives for nonmedical use of prescription opioids were as-
sessed by asking respondents who reported nonmedical use of
prescription opioids to indicate the most important reasons for
using prescription opioids without a doctor's orders from a list
of 17 binary items (Table 1).
Route of administration for nonmedical use of prescrip-
tion opioids was assessed with 5 items that asked which meth-
ods respondents used for taking prescription opioids not pre-
scribed to them. The binary items included (1) intranasal
(snorting or sniffing); (2) smoking; (3) injection; (4) orally (by
mouth); and (5) other.
Coingestion of nonmedical use of prescription opioids and
other drugs was measured with 10 items focused on the num-
ber of times prescription opioids were used at the same time
as other drugs so that the effects overlapped (eg, alcohol, mari-
juana, LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide], hallucinogens other
than LSD, cocaine, heroin). The response scale ranged from 1
(not at all) to 7 (every time).
Binge drinking was measured with a single item focused on
the frequency of having 5 or more drinks in a row during the
past 2 weeks. The response scale ranged from 1 (none) to 6
(10 or more times). Cigarette use was measured by asking
respondents how frequently they smoked cigarettes during
the past 30 days. The response scale ranged from 1 (none) to 7
(2 or more packs per day). Marijuana and other illicit drug
use--including marijuana, cocaine, LSD, psychedelics other
than LSD, and heroin--were measured by asking respondents
how many occasions (if any) they used [specified drug] in
their lifetime, past 12 months, and past 30 days. The response
scale for these items ranged from 1 (no occasions) to 7 (40 or
more occasions).

Medical use of prescription opioids was assessed by asking
respondents whether they had ever taken prescription opioids
because a doctor told them to use them. Respondents were in-
formed that prescription opioids are sometimes prescribed by
doctors and drugstores are not supposed to sell them without
a prescription. These included Vicodin, OxyContin, Perco-
dan, Percocet, Demerol, Dilaudid, morphine, opium, and co-
deine. The response scale included (1) no; (2) yes, but I had
already tried them on my own; and (3) yes, and it was the first
time I took any.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Analyses were restricted to those respondents with complete
data on demographic characteristics and drug use variables. The
unadjusted prevalence rates for motives to engage in nonmedi-
cal use of prescription opioids--across demographic charac-
teristics and substance use behaviors--were calculated with
cross-tabulations. 2 Tests of homogeneity and logistic regres-
sion analyses were conducted to determine whether sociode-
mographic characteristics and substance use behaviors were sig-
nificantly associated with motives for nonmedical use of
prescription opioids. For purposes of analysis, the following 4
mutually exclusive groups were examined: (1) no past-year non-
medical use of prescription opioids, (2) past-year nonmedical
use to relieve physical pain only, (3) past-year nonmedical use
to relieve physical pain and other motives, and (4) past-year
nonmedical use for motives other than to relieve physical pain.
The multistage sampling design resulted in clustering of data,
which may cause some overstatement of the statistical signifi-
cance when conducting analyses that do not fully account for
the complex design. Based on the number of comparisons being
performed, we used a conservative  of .01 for all 2 and lo-
gistic regression analyses. All statistical analyses were per-
formed using SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).
RESULTS
PREVALENCE OF MOTIVES FOR
NONMEDICAL USE OF PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS
Approximately 12.3% of the respondents--high school
seniors in the United States--reported lifetime nonmedi-
cal use of prescription opioids and 8.0% reported past-
year nonmedical use. Table 1 shows the prevalence of
motives for nonmedical use of prescription opioids among
high school seniors in the United States. The leading mo-
tives included "to relax or relieve tension" (56.4%), "to
feel good or get high" (53.5%), "to experiment, see what
it's like" (52.4%), "to relieve physical pain" (44.8%), and
"to have a good time with friends" (29.5%). The mo-
tives for nonmedical use of prescription opioids did not
differ between women and men based on 2 tests with 2
exceptions; women reported higher prevalence rates than
men "to get to sleep" (31.8% vs 21.3%; P.01) and "be-
cause of anger and frustration" (14.8% vs 8.1%; P.01).
The majority of nonmedical users of prescription opi-
oids reported more than 1 motive. Among nonmedical
users who reported motives, approximately 6.1% re-
ported pain relief as their only motive, 38.7% endorsed
pain relief and other motives, and 55.2% reported non­
pain relief motives only.
The association between past-year frequency of non-
medical use of prescription opioids and motives was ex-
amined. The past-year frequency of 10 or more occa-
sions was significantly higher for several motives than
the past-year frequency of other motives (P.01). For
example, the past-year frequency of 10 or more occa-
sions was higher among individuals who reported "to get
through the day" as compared with other motives (53.8%
vs 21.9%; P.001). Interestingly, the past-year fre-
quency of 10 or more occasions among nonmedical us-
ers motivated only by pain relief (21.7%) was lower than
those motivated by pain relief and other motives (33.7%)
but similar to those who reported non­pain relief mo-
tives only (20.5%).
MOTIVES FOR NONMEDICAL USE
OF PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS
AND OTHER SUBSTANCE USE BEHAVIORS
Table 2 shows prevalence estimates of substance use
behaviors among high school seniors based on motives
for past-year nonmedical use of prescription opioids. Bi-
variate analyses using 2 tests showed statistically sig-
nificant associations for all substance use behaviors
(Ps.01). The prevalence of substance use was gener-
ally highest among nonmedical users who reported non­
pain relief motives, followed by those who reported pain
relief and other motives and nonmedical users moti-
vated only by pain relief, and lowest among those who
did not engage in nonmedical use of prescription opi-
oids in the past 12 months.
Among nonmedical users of prescription opioids, those
motivated only by pain relief were considerably less likely
to use prescription opioids via nonoral routes of admin-
istration (eg, intranasal, injection, smoking) than non-
medical users who reported other motives. For in-
stance, 2.2% of nonmedical users motivated only by pain
relief used via intranasal administration while 32.8% of
those who reported pain relief and other motives and
35.3% of nonmedical users who reported non­pain re-
lief motives used via intranasal administration (P.001).
Furthermore, 11.4% of nonmedical users motivated only
by pain relief coingested prescription opioids and alco-
hol while a much higher percentage of those who re-
ported pain relief and other motives (53.2%) and non­
pain relief motives (57.8%) had coingested prescription
opioids and alcohol (P.001).
Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed the odds
ratios (ORs) for both groups of nonmedical users of pre-
scription opioids who reported non­pain relief motives
were significantly greater than high school seniors who
did not engage in past-year nonmedical use of prescrip-
tion opioids for all 23 substance use outcomes (P.01).
Furthermore, the ORs for nonmedical users of prescrip-
tion opioids who were motivated only by pain relief were
significantly greater than high school seniors who did not
engage in past-year nonmedical use of prescription opi-
oids for 8 of 23 substance use outcomes (P.01). In ad-
dition, the ORs for nonmedical users who were moti-
vated only by pain relief were significantly lower than
both groups of nonmedical users who reported non­
pain relief motives for the majority of substance use out-
comes.

MOTIVES FOR NONMEDICAL USE
OF PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS AND MEDICAL USE
OF PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS
The lifetime medical use of prescription opioids was re-
ported by approximately 14.0% of those who did not en-
gage in past-year nonmedical use of prescription opi-
oids, 76.1% of nonmedical users of prescription opioids
motivated only by pain relief, 71.4% of those motivated
by pain relief and other motives, and 46.7% of those who
reported non­pain relief motives only (P.001). Among
past-year nonmedical users of prescription opioids, ap-
proximately 56.5% of those motivated only by pain re-
lief, as compared with 23.1% of those who reported pain
relief and other motives and 14.2% of those who re-
ported only non­pain relief motives, had initiated medi-
cal use of prescription opioids before nonmedical use of
prescription opioids. In contrast, approximately 19.6%
of those motivated only by pain relief, as compared with
48.3% of those who reported pain relief and other mo-
tives and 32.5% of those who reported only non­pain re-
lief motives, initiated nonmedical use of prescription opi-
oids before medical use of prescription opioids.
Logistic regression analysis revealed the odds of medi-
cal use of prescription opioids were greater among non-
medical users of prescription opioids motivated only by
pain relief (OR, 19.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.9-
38.6), nonmedical users motivated by pain relief and other
motives (OR, 15.4; 95% CI, 11.8-19.9), and those who
reported non­pain relief motives only (OR, 5.4; 95% CI,
4.4-6.6) as compared with high school seniors who did
not engage in past-year nonmedical use of prescription
opioids. In addition, the odds of medical use of prescrip-
tion opioids were greater among nonmedical users of pre-
scription opioids motivated only by pain relief (OR, 3.6;
95% CI, 1.8-7.3) and nonmedical users motivated by pain

COMMENT
The prevalence of nonmedical use of prescription opioids
among adolescents and young adults in the United States
is now at its highest level in 15 years and represents a pub-
lic health concern.2-5 The present study found a wide range
of motives for nonmedical use of prescription opioids and
45% of nonmedical users were motivated to relieve physi-
cal pain. The prevalence of nonmedical use to relieve pain
is similar to the only other study to examine motives for
nonmedical use of prescription opioids based on nation-
ally representative samples of American high school se-
niors between 1976 and 1984, which found that 50% of
nonmedicalusersweremotivatedtorelievephysicalpain.13
Notably, lifetime and annual prevalence rates of nonmedi-
cal use of prescription opioids in the earlier study13 (10%
and 6%, respectively) were lower than this study (12% and
8%, respectively). Furthermore, the present study found
that nonmedical users of prescription opioids who re-
ported relief of physical pain as their sole motivation had
significantly lower rates of substance use behaviors than
other nonmedical users.
Recent studies have identified several important char-
acteristics of nonmedical use of prescription drugs that
can influence drug abuse potential, including fre-
quency, coingestion with other drugs, and route of ad-
ministration.11,14-20 The findings of the present study pro-
vide evidence that motives were significantly associated
with frequency of past-year nonmedical prescription opi-
oid use, nonoral routes of administration, coingestion of
prescription opioids and other drugs, and substance use
behaviors. Nonmedical users of prescription opioids mo-
tivatedonlytorelievephysicalpainhadconsiderablylower
odds than nonmedical users reporting other motives to
coingest prescription opioids with other drugs or use pre-
scription opioids via nonoral routes. Notably, nonmedi-
cal users who reported physical pain relief and other mo-
tives generally resembled nonmedical users who reported
only non­pain relief motives in regard to substance use
behaviors. These results reinforce previous studies that
have shown adolescents and young adults who engage
in nonmedical use of prescription opioids for motives
other than "to relieve pain" are at increased risk for drug
use and drug-related problems.10,11
Future clinical and research efforts should attempt to
differentiate between motives for nonmedical use of pre-
scription opioids because the present study identified sub-
types that were significantly associated with medical use
of prescription opioids and substance use behaviors. In-
terestingly, we found few sex differences in the motives
for nonmedical use of prescription opioids, which re-
semblesfindingsfromearlierworkwithinsecondaryschool
students.10,13 Notably, we found that more than 7 in every
10 nonmedical users of prescription opioids motivated by
pain relief reported a lifetime history of medical use of pre-
scriptionopioids.Recentworkindicatesnearly40%ofhigh
school seniors who reported nonmedical use of prescrip-
tion opioids in the past 12 months obtained these medi-
cations from their own previous prescriptions.21 These re-
sultssuggestthatappropriatepainmanagementandcareful
therapeutic monitoring could contribute to reductions in
the nonmedical use of prescription opioids among ado-
lescents. In addition, the elevated rates of substance use
behaviors found among nonmedical users reporting any
motives other than "to relieve physical pain" indicate such
behaviors are part of a pattern of "multiproblem" behav-
ior.22 Taken together, these findings suggest screening ef-
forts should be used to identify nonmedical users of pre-
scription opioids who may require appropriate pain
management and/or those who need more comprehen-
sive assessment for substance use disorders.
Based on the elevated risk for substance abuse among
nonmedical users who reported any motives other than "to
relieve physical pain," future work should identify sub-
groups of nonmedical users who endorse combinations of
motives because most nonmedical users have multiple mo-
tives underlying their behavior. Further, nonmedical us-
ersofprescriptionopioidsmotivatedonlybypainreliefhad
greater odds of more than 33% of the substance use out-
comes relative to their high school peers who did not use
prescription opioids nonmedically. Future research is
needed to determine the extent to which increased rates
of substance use among such individuals could be related
to untreated pain. Although the risk for substance abuse
appears to be lower among nonmedical users of prescrip-
tion opioids motivated by pain relief relative to nonmedi-
cal users with other motives, there are health risks to those
who use prescription opioids on their own, without a phy-
sician's orders, regardless of motive. For example, non-
medical users of prescription opioids do not benefit from
clinical assessments and monitoring nor do they receive
important medical information that accompanies appro-
priate pain management. Thus, nonmedical users are likely
unaware of the medication's proper use, contraindica-
tions, or potential for interaction with other drugs.
The present study had some limitations that need to
be taken into account while considering the implica-
tions of the findings. First, the results may not be gen-
eralized to other adolescent populations because our
sample was drawn from high school seniors and did not
include individuals who had dropped out or who were
absent from school on the day of the survey administra-
tion. Future research should examine motives for non-
medical use of prescription opioids in adolescents not at-
tending high school to assess whether findings in the
present study can be replicated in other populations. Sec-
ond, nonresponse may have introduced potential bias in
the present study and the data are subject to the poten-
tial bias introduced when collecting substance use be-
haviors via self-reports surveys. The present study at-
tempted to minimize potential biases by implementing
conditions that previous research has shown minimize
biases, such as informing potential respondents that par-
ticipation was voluntary and assuring potential respon-
dents that data would remain confidential.23-25 The preva-
lence rates of nonmedical use of prescription opioids in
the present study were comparable with rates reported
from national studies of adolescents and young adults.5,8

to examine subtypes of nonmedical users of prescrip-
tion opioids over time.
Despite these limitations, the findings of the present
study provide further evidence that a variety of motives
are currently subsumed under the estimates of nonmedi-
cal use of prescription opioids commonly reported in na-
tional drug use studies such as the National Survey on
Drug Use and Health, MTF, and National Epidemio-
logic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions.10,11,26 Ef-
forts to reduce consequences associated with nonmedi-
cal use of prescription opioids must be based on
knowledge of the motives associated with this behavior
because treatment implications can differ based on sub-
types of nonmedical users. In this regard, identifying mo-
tivations associated with nonmedical use of prescrip-
tion opioids at an early stage can help distinguish
individuals in need of an evaluation for pain manage-
ment and/or those who need more comprehensive as-
sessment and may require substance abuse treatment. The
findings of the present study suggest it is essential to move
away from combining multiple subtypes into the same
measure of nonmedical use of prescription opioids.
