Article
At age 27, Lil' Miss had recently embarked on a career in law
enforcement, and she was thriving. After enduring a violent
rape, her performance at work suffered, and she lost her job.
Unable to work due to trauma, Lil'Miss used her "three to four
thousand dollars" in savings to support herself for a year and a
half until she was able to work again. She also relied on her
brother and a close friend for financial assistance when money
grew short during her long recovery. As Lil' Miss' story sug-
gests, sexual assault often triggers increased expenses (Miller,
Cohen, & Weirsema, 1996), barriers to work (Loya, 2014a),
and decreased earnings for survivors (Macmillan, 2000). Lil'
Miss' experience also illustrates how assets, such as savings
and financial assistance from family and friends, can help sur-
vivors to weather economic difficulties in the wake of sexual
assault. Research in the field of asset development suggests
that modest financial assets can stabilize households facing
adverse financial events of this kind (Sherraden, 1991).
However, few studies have empirically examined whether
financial assets play a role in recovery from sexual violence,
and qualitative research on this issue is particularly scarce.
To address this gap in the literature, this study uses asset
theory and analysis of 27 in-depth interviews with sexual
assault survivors and rape crisis service providers to examine
how access to assets can impact survivors' economic and
overall well-being. Three types of asset are considered: liq-
uid assets, financial assistance from family or friends, and
homeownership. This exploratory research makes two
contributions to the field's understanding of sexual assault
and recovery. First, this study suggests that financial and
familial assets can help to buffer the financial costs of sexual
violence and facilitate access to services. Second, by high-
lighting the potential value of assets for survivors, the find-
ings suggest that the negative economic consequences of
sexual violence may burden survivors with fewer financial
resources more heavily than those who own significant
assets.As such, these findings shift the focus toward a dimen-
sion of inequality in recovery from sexual violence that is
often overlooked in research and that may have important
implications for public policy and victim services.
Sexual violence can take many forms, including rape,
attempted rape, and unwanted sexual contact or threats. In this
article, the terms sexual violence and sexual assault are used
interchangeably to refer to this inclusive definition of rape and
other sexually violent experiences. The present study focuses
on isolated sexual violence, which is defined as sexual violence
that is not part of a pattern of abuse by an intimate partner. (For
more information on this definition, see Loya, 2014a).

A Bridge to Recovery: How Assets Affect
Sexual Assault Survivors' Economic
Well-Being
Rebecca M. Loya1
Abstract
Sexual violence can trigger adverse economic events for survivors, including increased expenses and decreased earnings.
Using interview data, this exploratory study examines how access to assets (liquid assets, familial financial assistance, and
homeownership) affects survivors' economic well-being during recovery. In keeping with asset theory, liquid assets and
familial assistance can help offset post-assault expenses and facilitate access to services. Homeownership, meanwhile, appears
to have mixed effects on survivors' economic well-being. These findings suggest that the economic costs of sexual violence
can burden survivors with fewer financial resources more heavily than those who own significant assets. As such, these
findings shift the focus toward a dimension of inequality in recovery from sexual violence that is often overlooked in research
and that may have implications for public policy and victim services.

Economic Impact of Sexual Violence
Researchers have documented a range of economic impacts
of sexual violence, including increased expenses and effects
on employment and earnings. First, Miller and colleagues
(1996) estimated that each rape or sexual assault (excluding
child abuse) costs US$87,000: US$5,100 in tangible losses
(e.g., lost productivity, medical care, police services) and
US$81,400 in lost quality of life in 1993 dollars. This trans-
lates to US$142,533 in 2014 dollars (U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics, 2015; for state-level estimates, see also Post,
Mezey, Maxwell, & Wibert, 2002). Notably, survivors are
often personally responsible for a share of these expenses,
including the costs of medical and mental health care and
lost wages (Chrisler & Ferguson, 2006). In addition, there is
evidence that some sexual assault survivors need to move
residences (Elklit & Shevlin, 2009), which may trigger hous-
ing-related costs such as the security deposit and first and
last months' rent.
Second, sexual violence can affect survivors' employ-
ment and reduce their lifetime earnings. Survivors of sexual
violence often require time off from work (Tjaden &
Thoennes, 2006) and suffer from higher rates of unemploy-
mentcomparedwithnon-victims(Byrne,Resnick,Kilpatrick,
Best, & Saunders, 1999). Indeed, Loya (2014a) uncovered
numerous negative employment consequences of isolated
sexual assault--including unpaid time off, diminished per-
formance, job loss, and inability to work--all of which can
lead to lower earnings. Similarly, MacMillan (2000) found
that sexual victimization during adolescence can diminish
survivors' educational and occupational attainment, leading
to lower earnings in adulthood.
These economic consequences of sexual assault are sim-
ilar to the negative financial effects of intimate partner vio-
lence (IPV), which can include physical or sexual violence,
control tactics, and economic abuse (Adams, Tolman,
Bybee, Sullivan, & Kennedy, 2012; Browne, Salomon, &
Bassuk, 1999; Lloyd & Taluc, 1999; Raphael & Tolman,
1997; Romero, Chavkin, Wise, & Smith, 2003). In the IPV
field, there is also evidence that financial stability and
homeownership are associated with lower rates of violence
(Benson, Fox, DeMaris, & Van Wyk, 2003; Brownridge,
2005; Christy-McMullin, 2006; Fox, Benson, DeMaris, &
Van Wyk, 2002; Page-Adams, 1995; Rennison & Welchans,
2000), suggesting that asset ownership may be a protective
factor against IPV. In recent years, policymakers and ser-
vice providers have developed asset building and financial
education programs for IPV survivors, with the goals of
increasing their financial independence, self-esteem, and
safety (Sanders & Schnabel, 2006, 2011; Sanders, Weaver,
& Schnabel, 2007). This research and practice may have
implications for survivors of sexual violence outside the
context of IPV; yet few researchers have considered the
relationship between assets and non-IPV sexual violence.
Thus, it is worth considering whether access to financial
assets can buffer the economic impacts of isolated sexual
violence, including non-IPV sexual assault.
Asset Theory and Related Literature
Asset theory contends that asset ownership can play a crucial
role in cushioning economic shocks such as job loss, divorce,
or unanticipated medical bills (Sherraden, 1991). This cush-
ioning can mean the difference between long-term economic
stability and the cyclical revisiting of poverty. Asset theory
also suggests that asset ownership is associated with psycho-
logical and physical benefits and that it can have a transfor-
mative effect on a family's class status. Although prior asset
research has not addressed sexual assault as a cause of eco-
nomic shocks, the research outlined above demonstrates that
such violence may indeed trigger unanticipated expenses and
lost wages. Thus, the principles of asset theory suggest that
assets may play an important role in survivors' recovery
from sexual violence.
Assets may be tangible possessions (e.g., savings, real
estate) or intangible resources (e.g., social and human capi-
tal; Sherraden, 1991). As Chang (2006) summarizes, assets
offer many benefits that income does not:
Wealth can be transferred to others, can generate income
(through interest, capital gains, and rent, for example), can be
used as collateral for loans and provides the ability to weather
common financial crises, such as spells of unemployment or
illness, in which income is temporarily disrupted. (p. 112)
The children and other kin of asset owners benefit from
their relatives' wealth via financial support, gifts, and inheri-
tance (Chiteji & Hamilton, 2005; Oliver & Shapiro, 1995;
Shapiro, 2004). Similarly, social capital--one's social net-
work--can also be an asset. For example, in times of need,
rather than relying on public benefits and charities, those
with strong social networks can turn to friends and relatives
for emergency housing or help paying bills (Edin & Lein,
1997).
While it is intuitive that those with greater resources are
better positioned to recover from economic challenges,
research suggests that even in relatively small amounts,
assets can significantly improve a household's financial sta-
bility in the face of adverse events. For instance, researchers
define asset-poverty as having inadequate liquid assets to
support one's household for 3 months at the federal poverty
level. To be above the asset­poverty threshold ("asset-own-
ers"), a family of four would own at least US$4,000 in 1997
dollars, or US$5,900 in 2014 (Haveman & Wolff, 2004; U.S.
BLS, 2015). McKernan, Ratcliffe, and Vinopal (2009) found
that asset owners are less likely to experience material hard-
ship following an economic shock than are asset-poor house-
holds. For example, asset owners who experience involuntary
job loss are much less likely to face food insecurity as a
result, in part because they can spend their assets to maintain
Loya 3
their former level of consumption (see also Keating, 2012).
Importantly, McKernan and colleagues also found that assets
have the largest protective effects for families in the two
lower thirds of the income distribution, even though they
own significantly smaller dollar amounts than the top third.
To the extent that sexual violence creates economic shocks,
assets may help cushion such adverse financial effects even
for low-income survivors.
In addition to providing a cushion in the case of financial
emergencies, asset ownership is associated with improved
health and well-being for individuals, families, and neigh-
borhoods. The beneficial byproducts of asset ownership,
known as asset effects, include improved life satisfaction, a
greater sense of control over one's life, increased future ori-
entation, children's improved educational performance, and
better health (Moore et al., 2001; Page-Adams, Scanlon,
Beverly, & McDonald, 2001; Rohe & Stegman, 1994;
Yadama & Sherraden, 1996; Zhan & Sherraden, 2003).
Homeownership is also associated with lower rates of IPV
(Brownridge, 2005; Christy-McMullin, 2006; Page-Adams,
1995; Rennison & Welchans, 2000).
The literature on assets and isolated sexual violence is
limited. Loya (2014b) makes a theoretical argument that
asset ownership may be both a protective factor for sexual
violence and help survivors to recover because women can
leverage their assets to increase safety and to access support-
ive services. Similarly, Myhill and Allen (2002) found that
the prevalence of rape among British women living in owner-
occupied housing is half that of women in the private rental
sector and one quarter that of public housing residents. This
may suggest that homeownership has a protective effect
against rape, as with IPV. However, these differences may
also be explained by other housing or neighborhood charac-
teristics, such as crime rates, social norms, or police atten-
tion. In addition, Ullman (1996, 1999) documented an
association between social support and improved recovery
from rape, but researchers have not considered financial
assistance from family and friends as a type of social sup-
port. At present, no empirical research has examined whether
asset effects extend to the well-being or recovery of sexual
assault survivors. The present exploratory study begins to
address a gap in the literature by considering whether and
how asset ownership affects sexual assault survivors' well-
being during recovery.
Method
Participants
The data for this study are drawn from in-depth, semi-struc-
tured interviews with 18 rape crisis service providers and 9
sexual assault survivors. These two groups of participants
offer distinct and valuable perspectives on the research ques-
tion. Through their experience helping survivors overcome
various post-assault barriers, rape crisis service providers
have access to a wealth of knowledge about the needs of
sexual assault survivors during recovery. Importantly, rape
crisis service providers can offer information about patterns
they have observed among the many survivors with whom
they have worked over time. As a key feature of assets is
their ability to prevent financial strain, service providers are
well situated to detect such effects by comparing among their
clients. Sexual assault survivors can speak to the economic
impact of sexual violence in their own lives and whether
assets played a role in their recovery. This sampling strategy
allows for triangulation among different types of providers
as well as between providers' and survivors' perspectives
(Krefting, 1991; Lincoln & Guba, 1985).
I used a purposive sampling technique to recruit service
provider participants in two metropolitan areas in a north-
eastern state. The sampling objective was to interview pro-
viders from a range of locations in the rape crisis service
network so that respondents could speak to the experiences
of survivors who enter the service system at various points,
seeking a variety of services. I identified rape crisis agencies
through referrals from the Department of Public Health and
the state's largest rape crisis center. I recruited providers who
had worked directly with survivors of isolated sexual assault
and who reported having knowledge of the economic dimen-
sion of sexual violence for their clients. While some provid-
ers worked with survivors of multiple kinds of violence (IPV,
child sexual abuse, and isolated sexual assault), the inter-
views focused on the impact of sexual violence that was not
part of a pattern of abuse.
I interviewed 18 service providers from seven agencies,
as noted in Table 1. Within each of these agencies, I inter-
viewed a director plus one to three staff members from each
department or specialty area, depending on the size of their
staff and scope of their services. Agencies offering more ser-
vices are more heavily represented in the sample. Providers
included lawyers, counselors, advocates, administrators, and
those holding dual roles. Providers had an average of 10.5
years of experience in the rape crisis field, with a range of 16
months to 20 years. The majority of provider participants
(15) were White, which generally reflected the demograph-
ics of their agencies. The providers served survivors at all
stages of recovery, from immediately post-assault to decades
later, so participants offered various perspectives on the
recovery trajectory.
I used a convenience sampling technique to recruit survi-
vor participants. I posted flyers at local service provider
agencies, college campuses, and a women's community cen-
ter. The Department of Public Health sent an e-mail
announcement to its statewide listserv, and rape crisis agency
volunteers and staff disseminated the announcement to their
networks as well. I recruited survivors who were age 18 or
older and self-identified as victims or survivors of isolated
sexual assault, using the study's definition: rape, attempted
rape, or other unwanted sexual contact or threats since the
age of 12, which is not part of a pattern of abuse. Note that

aThese numbers exceed the survivor sample size (9) because some

this definition includes both assaults committed by non-inti-
mates (e.g., strangers or acquaintances) and violence com-
mitted by intimate partners that was not part of a pattern of
abuse (e.g., a single rape by an otherwise non-violent hus-
band). In addition, while members of the sample may have
also experienced a pattern of IPV or child abuse, the inter-
views focused on the isolated sexual assault(s) each survivor
had experienced since the age of 12. This age threshold was
based on the criteria used by the state's largest rape crisis
center, which offers services to survivors age 12 or over and
refers younger victims to a child-specific service provider.At
least 1 year must have lapsed since the survivor's most recent
sexual assault, with no upper time limit. This way, different
survivors could speak about both their long- and short-term
experiences of recovery.
I conducted interviews with 10 female survivors, 1 of
whom was excluded from the final sample because she
viewed her rape as part of a pattern of abuse by an intimate
partner. The survivors' basic demographic information is
noted in Table 2. At the time of the interview, survivors'
income levels ranged from less than US$15,000 to more than
US$105,000 annually, while their households ranged in size
from 1 to 4 persons, with a mean of 2.4. Eight of the 9 survi-
vors had been raped, while the 9th experienced a non-rape
sexual assault. The mean number of lifetime sexual assaults
was four. Most of the assault incidents were committed by
people known to the survivors (acquaintances, intimates, or
family members), but about half of the participants (5) had
been assaulted by strangers. Survivors were between 18 and
32 years old (with a mean of 24) at the time of their most
recent assault. The mean number of years since the most
recent assault was 17, with a range of 2 to 31. To ensure con-
fidentiality, pseudonyms are used for survivors, and identify-
ing details have been changed or omitted.
Data Collection and Analysis
All interviews were conducted by the author and followed an
interview schedule that was developed as part of a larger
project examining the impact of sexual assault on survivors'
financial well-being. In the interviews, participants answered
questions about what expenses arose in the wake of sexual
violence and how survivors paid for these costs. Drawing on
Shapiro's (2004) qualitative approach to the study of asset
ownership, I also asked participants whether they (or their
clients) had access to three major types of assets: (a) liquid
assets, (b) financial assistance from family or friends, and (c)
homeownership. Those who reported that they (or their cli-
ents) had access to assets were also asked whether and how
each type of asset affected the survivor's experience post-
assault. Survivors who had experienced multiple isolated
sexual assaults were asked about the role of assets in recov-
ery from each assault. Providers and survivors were asked
questions on the same topics, with the exception of informa-
tion related to personal experiences with sexual violence and
certain demographic items. Interviews were conducted in
person at a location of the participant's choosing or by phone
between January and July of 2011. The interviews lasted
from 40 min to 2 hr, with most lasting 60 to 90 min.

To analyze the interview data, I used open and focused
coding, which is a form of thematic analysis that combines
inductive and deductive inquiry (Emerson, Fretz, & Shaw,
1995). Using Atlas.ti software, I coded the data on both a
priori expectations (derived from the literature) and ideas
that emerged from participants'stories.Apriori codes include
asset type, asset amount, and asset effect (an asset's reported
impact on the survivor's ability to cover new expenses,
afford services, or endure an economic shock). Examples of
inductive codes include assets improving survivors' flexibil-
ity with work and homeownership as a double-edged sword.
Next, I analyzed the data by asset type and identified differ-
ent themes for liquid assets, familial assistance, and home-
ownership. Finally, I examined the coded data for
triangulation or divergence among various types of providers
and between providers and survivors. In general, there was a
high degree of consistency between the groups' responses.
The analysis was verified at each stage using peer examina-
tion and debriefing (Krefting, 1991; Lincoln & Guba, 1985).
Although the small sample size limits the generalizability of
these findings, the rich data offer insight into the roles of
financial and familial assets in recovery from sexual
violence.
Findings: The Role of Assets in
Recovery From Sexual Violence
The majority of providers (15 of 18) and survivors (8 of 9)
reported that assets--liquid assets, familial financial assis-
tance, or homeownership--have a positive impact on some
aspect of survivors' post-assault well-being. However, the
three asset types seem to affect survivors' well-being differ-
ently. The data suggest that liquid assets and familial finan-
cial assistance can help survivors to weather economic
shocks and boost their sense of control and security, while
homeownership can have mixed effects on survivors' eco-
nomic and overall well-being.
Liquid Assets
Respondents consistently reported that survivors benefit
from access to liquid assets, which include savings, stocks,
and bonds. Most providers (11 of 18) reported that their cli-
ents had drawn upon liquid assets during recovery, and about
half of the survivors (4 of 9) had access to liquid assets
immediately following one of their assaults. Survivors
reported that they owned from "a little" to US$50,000 at the
time of the assault. Although limited in number, there was
strong agreement among the asset owners that savings posi-
tively impacted their recovery in ways that were consistent
with providers' responses. I identified three major themes
related to liquid assets: These assets can (a) cushion eco-
nomic shocks related to the assault, (b) increase survivors'
flexibility and their access to services, and (c) help survivors
to feel more secure.
First, these data suggest that survivors can use liquid
assets to cover their immediate expenses and cushion eco-
nomic shocks, such as job loss and emergency expenses. For
instance, a lawyer (P102) described how her clients have
used savings when their employment was disrupted:
If you get unemployed and if you have some savings, at least
you're not going to be destitute right away. It's just like that with
any client. I mean, especially if they need time off work, they
can fall back on savings. Or if they get fired, if they get laid off
[or] something, or if they quit, they have some sort of savings
that they can fall back on for a little while. If they don't have it,
then they can't necessarily focus on their emotional well-being.
That they have to think about how are they going to survive and
support themselves and their kids?
Similarly, survivors who owned assets reported using
their savings to get through post-assault earnings disruptions.
For instance, Lil' Miss, a 51-year-old survivor who was
introduced above, was fired from her job as a result of post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related performance issues.
She lived off her "three to four thousand dollars" in savings
for 18 months until she could secure a new job.
In addition to job loss, unanticipated expenses, such as
medical bills, counseling fees, and moving costs, often arise
in the wake of sexual violence. Participants consistently
reported that survivors who own liquid assets use them to
cover such unanticipated expenses. For instance, a lawyer
(P110) described how savings facilitate access to services
and allow survivors to benefit from victim compensation
programs, which reimburse survivors for crime-related
expenses:
If they have access to savings, it makes it much easier for them
because a lot of these costs, too, you pay it up front, and then
you're reimbursed. So, I think the long-term effects are lessened,
because they can pay it. They have the money, it's in reserve,
they can pay it, and then they'll get refunded or reimbursed. It
goes back into the savings, so over the course of a year, let's just
say, they're back at base level.
In contrast, those without savings would need to either
incur debt to pay the up-front costs or forego services alto-
gether. Indeed, providers reported that many of their poor,
uninsured clients go without HIV prophylaxis because they
cannot afford the US$600 to US$1,000 expense, while others
experience financial crises when ambulance bills (as high as
US$800) eat up income that was intended for rent and other
necessities. Survivors who were uninsured and had no sav-
ings post-assault also explained that they could not afford
medical and mental health care.
Second, in addition to buffering economic shocks, liquid
assets can give survivors more options to access the services
they need without raising significant financial concerns.
Savings also allow some survivors the flexibility to take time
to recover, to focus on their emotional well-being, even to
6 SAGE Open
change jobs or go back to school. For example, one coun-
selor (P106) described how savings proved useful to a client
who had been assaulted in her home:
[She] was able to move [to a new home] because she did have
assets. It was a no-brainer. It was going to happen, and it
happened really quickly, and she didn't have to think twice
about it. And it was a huge relief. So knowing you can afford
co-payments for mental health care. Knowing you could throw
away every, you know, the sheet, the comforter, and the pillows
and go out and drop a few hundred dollars for new bedding or
even a new mattress. Knowing you could take two weeks off and
do nothing or go away, if you want.
This counselor described an array of benefits and com-
forts her client was able to access due to her savings, includ-
ing the ability to move to a new home quickly. This stands in
stark contrast to the challenges faced by poor and asset-poor
survivors. For instance, many providers described their less
advantaged clients spending months on the waiting list for
subsidized housing.
Another provider, an administrator (P107), similarly com-
pared the flexibility conferred by liquid assets with the stark
choices faced by some asset-poor survivors:
It makes all the difference if they have it [savings] or if they
don't have it. If they have it, then they are still going to be
dealing with all of those same issues, but they have that cushion
there. So if they need to leave their job and take a few months,
then maybe they can do that and get back up on their feet enough
so that they can start a new job and feel comfortable doing that.
If they don't have that cushion, then they need to force
themselves to go to work when they're not feeling capable of
doing that. Or if they do lose their job or have to quit their job,
then they're definitely in danger of becoming homeless and
incurring a lot of debt because they don't have anywhere to turn
and any way to protect themselves and give themselves the time
that they need to get back on their feet.
Survivors' stories echoed these sentiments about how liq-
uid assets increased their flexibility and options for recovery.
For instance, Lisa, a 48-year-old survivor, quit the job where
her perpetrator worked and was subsequently unable to work
due to rape-related trauma. To support herself, she liquidated
her US$50,000 in stock and sold the home she owned with
her then-husband. These assets allowed Lisa to take a year
off from work, then go back to college, and ultimately change
professions entirely. Referring to the proceeds from her
stocks, she explained,
Thankfully, it gave me an opportunity to go back to school . . .
That's in my 30s, you know, so at that point, [I was] just feeling
as though, "This: It's now or never. I mean, if I want a career,
then I've got to go back to school." And if I didn't have the
savings that I had . . . I mean really, I ended up being able to live
off of the savings I had and live off of it for probably two and a
half or three years.
These assets played a life-altering role in Lisa's recovery
by opening up options for her to finish her college education
and access a professional career. (Lisa's homeownership is
discussed in detail later.) Other survivors in the sample used
their assets to take time off from work, pay for counseling co-
pays, and access healing services such as yoga or massage.
Third, participants reported that owning liquid assets can
boost survivors' sense of control over their lives, increase
feelings of safety, and dispel panic about what would happen
if they lost their employment. For instance, a counselor
(P112) described this benefit, saying asset ownership "affects
their [survivors'] sense of safety and well-being. Okay, so, if
you have savings, then there's this sense like, `You're going
to be okay,' or you have some control over the fact that
you're going to be okay.'" Importantly, this counselor sug-
gested that the value of assets goes beyond the knowledge
that a survivor will "be okay," extending to her sense of con-
trol over that outcome. Similarly, another counselor (P111)
described the comfort one of her clients took in knowing that
her savings kept her from being completely reliant on the
income from her job:
It wouldn't be the end of the world that she lost her job. She
doesn't have the stress about the fact that she might be too
depressed to go to work one day . . . There's this extra layer of
stress that a lot of my clients get, that they start to panic around
"what if." So one of the things we work on [in counseling] is
being in the present. They start to panic around, "What if I can't
go to work? What if I can't do the work, what if I lose my job?
What if, what if, what if?" She doesn't have the panic about the
"what if."
This counselor suggested that much of the benefit of asset
ownership lies in the absence of worry about economic con-
cerns, compared with non-owners. For this reason, service
providers are a useful source of data, as they may be able to
detect such effects through comparison among clients. For
survivors, it may be more difficult to perceive such effects
firsthand. Indeed, a survivor's description of the effect of her
inherited savings bears this out.
Juana, a 28-year-old survivor, was first assaulted 5 years
ago and suffered a second assault at age 25. She first men-
tioned her inherited savings in the context of her current
assault-related medical bills, which exceed US$800. When I
asked how she managed these expenses, Juana explained, "I
was lucky enough that I was left some money by my grand-
father, so I have a little bit of a cushion that I can use. But
another part is I make sacrifices." She later explained that
she used this inheritance to support herself through college,
to pay for all expenses not covered by her scholarship. Later
in the interview, I asked Juana if these assets played any role
in her experience following the assault. She responded,
Not really, because they [inherited savings] weren't something
that I really consciously thought about, unless I was in kind of
dire straits for money. I mean I knew it was there. I knew that's
Loya 7
what I would use to pay my rent each month, but I didn't think
of it as something I could use as any sort of luxury.
From her response, it appears Juana did not readily recog-
nize any additional security her savings conveyed post-
assault. Yet, by noting that she "knew the savings were there"
and that they allowed her to pay her medical bills, she implied
that her inheritance alleviated a potential source of stress.
When viewed within the context of providers' reports and
asset theory, Juana's story is consistent with the contention
that asset ownership is associated with an increased sense of
security. However, this example also demonstrates the diffi-
culty of detecting or measuring this type of effect among sur-
vivors and suggests the need for further research in this area.
Financial Assistance From Family or Friends
The second type of asset examined in this study is financial
assistance from family or friends, such as providing money
for rent or offering a place to stay. The majority of providers
(11 of 18) and survivors (7 of 9) affirmed the value of this
type of assistance. For instance, a lawyer (P100) explained
the manifold benefits of kin assistance for her clients:
Any time a survivor feels like they have someone who is
supporting them, that's another person who can help them
brainstorm, another person who can sort of tap into their network
of trying to figure out financially what to do, or it may be even
more tangible: Maybe it's someone they can stay with or
someone who can help them this month, or whatever it is, [with]
very tangible things. A lot of survivors will move in with
someone who believes them to [get] help.
Many survivor participants echoed this lawyer's state-
ment, explaining that they relied heavily on family and
friends for shelter, food, and other financial assistance in the
aftermath of sexual violence. For instance, Brooke, a 35-year-
old survivor, explained that she relied on the goodwill of
friends when she was unable to work for several years after
being raped, and her family turned its back on her:
I had friends who took me into their home and paid for--paid
my rent, paid for my food, took me places, basically treated me
like family for about 3 years. I probably would've thrown myself
off a building if it wasn't for them.
Brooke's statement speaks for itself as far as the impact
this assistance had on her life. Financial assistance also takes
less substantial forms, including the comfort of knowing one
could rely on family or friends for help if funds ran short. For
instance, Jane, a survivor who was raped at age 22, explained,
My parents would have [helped me] if I needed it. They would
have supplemented my--what I was earning, if I needed--if I
didn't have enough for rent. But I was really sort of determined
to try to--It was at a stage where I was trying to become
independent from them, and I was reluctant to want to ask for
help. So, I tried to avoid that to the extent I could. But my--I
mean my parents were willing and able to supplement if I needed
it . . . You know, my dad came down to help me, and he helped
me move.
By emphasizing that she knew her parents were "willing
and able" to help her as needed, Jane suggests that this
knowledge offered her comfort, even as she strove for
independence.
Beyond the material benefits of such support, several pro-
viders talked about how assistance from family and friends is
important because it communicates others' belief in and sup-
port for the survivor at this crucial moment in her or his life.
For example, a provider who held dual roles as a counselor
and administrator (P109) spelled out the multifaceted value
of familial financial assistance for survivors:
It provides them with money, but I also think there is this way of
people giving back to them. Somebody took stuff away and
there is this real [effect] . . . but it's [also] symbolic--seeing
those people are there for you when you're at your lowest point.
So, I think it's money, and it's really helpful. And I think it's
also--it probably is [as] good as any intervention. It's just like,
"Okay, people care enough to provide me with support."
As this provider emphasizes, economic support can repre-
sent much more than money. Survivors benefit from both the
direct financial effects of such support, as well as its sym-
bolic value.
While familial financial assistance can be very important
to survivors, many do not have access to such assistance.
Respondents reported numerous barriers to financial sup-
port, including relatives' inability to help, survivors' hesita-
tion to seek assistance, and people not believing the survivor.
First, a family's ability to offer financial assistance often
hinges on their income level and asset ownership, and poorer
families simply have less to offer in this area. For example, a
lawyer (P101) explained that unlike her middle-class clients,
her low-income clients "don't have family who have money,
and they don't have friends who have money." Another pro-
vider, a counselor (P106), said simply, "If you come from
poverty, you're not going to be able to turn to your family for
money . . . And people who have families with less income
are probably much more reticent to ask for any help." Lil'
Miss, a survivor whose story is told above, may offer a help-
ful example of this. Lil' Miss grew up in a low-income com-
munity, and although she reported that her brother and best
friend would write her checks whenever she asked, she
struggled with homelessness and poverty for years after
depleting her own savings. This suggests that there were lim-
its to the amount of help she was willing to seek or that her
kin were able to give.
A second barrier to seeking financial help is that survivors
may feel inclined to spare their families from the pain of their
8 SAGE Open
assault for a variety of reasons. For example, a counselor
(P112) explained that her clients often fear that their family
members "will have a heart attack or suffer some sort of
mental breakdown if they found out." Similarly, Sally, a sur-
vivor who lost her job after being raped at age 23, explained
that she did not want to burden her recently divorced mother
by asking for help:
My father died when I was a child, and my mother had gone
through a divorce a couple of years before the assault, and so I
didn't really want to ask her [for financial assistance], and plus
. . . it was really important for me to just feel like I was on my own.
Instead of asking for financial assistance, she worked in
temporary jobs, earning a subsistence living for 4 years until
she was ready to return to full-time work.
A third barrier is that stigma associated with sexual vio-
lence can keep people from seeking or receiving assistance.
A lawyer (P100) explained,
It would be one thing if they had crashed their car and needed
help buying a new car. But of course when you layer on that it's
a sexual assault, there's all this stigma and shame and blame,
and nobody wants to talk about it . . . So that many survivors will
feel like they can't reach out to their normal support system
because of the issue.
As the stigma associated with rape victimization is wide-
spread and deeply entrenched (Herman, 1992; Ullman, 1996,
1999), it may serve as a significant barrier preventing survi-
vors from seeking financial assistance from family and
friends. Survivors' willingness to ask for help may also
depend on the quality of their relationships with kin.
A fourth and related barrier to familial assistance is when
survivors'social networks do not believe or support them. For
instance, a lawyer (P100) described how this has affected her
clients: "So many of my clients do not have that option [famil-
ial financial assistance], either because they're ostracized by
their family, the family knows the assailant and they believe
him or her, or they just don't want to tell." Several survivors
in the study reported that their families and friends responded
in this way, either not believing them or blaming them for the
violence. For instance, Brooke was kidnapped and raped at
age 16 by a man she had met online. She explained that her
family, friends, and community blamed her for the attack:
Well, my mother decided that I was a pathologically lying slut.
So that relationship, crap as it was, was pretty much turned on its
ear. My local friends, many of them didn't really want anything
to do with me the following year, since "pathologically lying
slut" went around my church youth group as well. I did pick up
new friends that year, but I lost contact with them almost
immediately.
Brooke later dropped out of college out of fear when her
perpetrator contacted her on campus. She was fortunate to
make new friends who provided her significant help until she
was able to support herself financially. Still, for survivors
like Brooke, having family and friends who do not believe
and support them shuts the door on a potential source of
financial and emotional support.
Homeownership
The third type of asset considered in this study is homeowner-
ship. Ten providers offered information about the effects of
homeownership on survivors' economic well-being, and one
survivor owned a home at the time of her assault. This low rate
of homeownership at the time of the assault may be due in part
to the relatively young age at which most of the survivors were
assaulted. Survivors in this sample were between 18 and 32
years old at the time of their most recent sexual assault, with a
mean age of 24, while the median age of first home purchase
in the United States is 31 (Taylor, 2013). Despite this smaller
subsample, these exploratory findings may shed light on the
role of homeownership in recovery and help to identify areas
for further research. The interview data suggest that home-
ownership can have mixed effects on survivors' economic
well-being. Some respondents reported that homeowners can
experience a greater sense of stability, but many noted that
homeownership can be a "double-edged sword."
Six provider respondents and one survivor reported that
homeownership can be beneficial for survivors. However,
the extent to which survivors can make use of this benefit
depends on whether the survivor wishes to move as a result
of the assault. First, providers noted that homeowners have
the freedom to make changes to their homes to feel safer in
the wake of violence. For example, a lawyer (P110)
explained, "If they own their home, we don't have to worry
about working with landlords to get locks changed or any-
thing like that. I guess they incur that expense, but at least
we're not negotiating." A second benefit of homeownership
in these data is the potential to leverage one's equity to pur-
chase services that enhance safety or aid with recovery. For
instance, a lawyer (P100) explained,
I think the pro if it [the rape] didn't happen in the house would
be that you do have this asset, so that if you took out a second--I
don't really know that much about finances--but if you took out
a second mortgage, or if you were able to get a loan, you might
be able to leverage it to get some money to be able to take time
off work or whatever it was.
Through home equity lines of credit, homes can function
like liquid assets, increasing survivors' flexibility and poten-
tially cushioning economic shocks. However, this provider
went on to note that any benefits of homeownership are less-
ened if the assault occurred in the house:
But if happened in the house, I think it's a con because now
you're stuck living in your [house], and it's tainted. Maybe it's
Loya 9
been your house for 20 years, like where you raised your family,
and ugh, that's a mess.
In a similar vein, Lisa, who was introduced above, was
the only survivor who owned a home at the time of her
assault. She explained that she felt compelled to move to a
new home after her husband raped her in the house they
owned together:
There was no way I was going to stay in that house, because it
did happen in the house, and it happened where my stepdaughter
heard everything. So, so, I wanted--I definitely wanted to move
to a new [home]. This was in [a different state], and it would
have been very easy for the wife to keep the house. It's a super,
super easy thing in the [state's] divorce court. But yeah, there
was no question, no question.
At the same time, Lisa also noted that the proceeds from
the sale of her home were important to her recovery. She
explained that she and her husband "divided the investments
and we sold the house. And I was able to use all of that to
support myself and go to school." As she noted, Lisa lived on
the money from that home sale, along with her stocks, when
she quit her job and went back to college. Her college degree
allowed her to pursue a new career as a teacher. Lisa rented a
home for many years, until she and her second husband pur-
chased a home together. Lisa's experience illustrates the
potential for homeownership to offer flexibility and security
during recovery, at least for a survivor who is willing and
able to sell her home.
However, seven provider participants reported that home-
ownership creates barriers for survivors in the wake of
assault because owning a home is expensive and makes mov-
ing difficult. Many survivors wish to move for safety rea-
sons, while others find they are no longer able to afford their
homes due to assault-related income disruptions. A lawyer
(P110) explained, "Often if they own their own home too,
they can't move as easily. That's their home, so if they don't
want to continue living there, they have to sell that home . . .
yeah, now we're opening a big bag of worms." As this law-
yer implies, selling a home is more time-consuming and
complex than moving from one rental to another. The alter-
native process of finding a tenant and managing a rental
property similarly requires time and attention, which would
add to a survivor's burden in the immediate aftermath of
trauma. Plus there is a chance that the house would not sell or
rent, and the survivor would find herself forced to continue
living in a home in which she does not feel safe or which she
can no longer afford.
Another potentially negative impact of homeownership
that emerged from these data is the drive to keep a home that
has become unaffordable. For instance, a lawyer (P103)
explained, "When they do [own property], it's huge. I think
that they don't want to lose it . . . It becomes this `die by the
sword' type of a moment for them, even to the point of their
own safety being jeopardized." This lawyer shared the case
of an asset-poor survivor who had purchased a condominium
using a subsidized mortgage program. After being raped, she
could no longer work full time. The resulting reduction in her
income caused her to fall nearly US$4,000 in arrears. The
lawyer explained that her client would likely never recover
financially from this setback because she simply could not
afford her home payments on her new part-time salary. Yet,
the client was doing everything in her power to keep the
home.
Relatedly, an administrator (P107) noted that homeowners
are not immune from the challenges faced by renters, such as
difficulty making payments when income is disrupted:
If the person owns their place but they still have a huge mortgage,
I think that they fall in the same trap of "How do I pay this
mortgage?" I mean, they may be able to hold onto where they're
living longer and not have to deal with, you know, "What do I
tell my landlord or don't tell my landlord?" It's more about
personally how they are going to figure it out. So yeah I think it
does help a little bit, but in the end if they don't have a lot of
savings to help them out, it might not.
Other providers similarly talked about clients losing their
homes to foreclosure because their earnings decreased dra-
matically in the aftermath of sexual assault. These stories
illustrate the precarious position that homeowners who are
otherwise asset-poor face when their income is disrupted.
Having a mortgage on a home is not enough; savings or other
liquid assets are needed to cover housing costs in the case of
serious income disruption.
Discussion
These findings suggest that financial assets, particularly sav-
ings and familial financial assistance, can serve as a crucial
bridge to recovery from sexual violence by standing in for
lost wages, covering unexpected expenses, and increasing
flexibility. While asset theory has not previously been applied
to isolated sexual violence, these findings are consistent with
the theory's central contention that assets can buffer eco-
nomic shocks. Because sexual violence can create a wide
range of adverse economic events for survivors, these data
suggest that those with financial resources may be better sit-
uated to recover from this trauma.
The idea that wealth inequalities inform rape survivors'
experiences contrasts with the common belief that "sexual
violence does not discriminate" (as an administrator stated in
an interview). Advocates in the field of violence against
women have long used this as an organizing idea to combat
stigma and raise awareness that sexual and domestic vio-
lence happen in rich and poor communities alike (Richie,
2000). While the idea that "rape does not discriminate" often
refers to its prevalence across socioeconomic strata, this
message ignores the potential for disparate effects for poor
survivors. This study's findings suggest that the economic
effects of sexual violence may weigh more heavily on
10 SAGE Open
asset-poor victims than wealthy ones. Hence, these findings
point to inequalities in recovery from sexual violence, which
are often not considered in research and that can inform pub-
lic policy and victim services. Due to the small sample size
and exploratory nature of this study, further research is war-
ranted to gain a generalizable understanding of the roles of
asset ownership--and asset-poverty--in recovery.
This study also builds upon and extends our understand-
ing of asset theory and the role of assets in recovery from
trauma in several ways. First, the findings suggest that liquid
assets can buffer the economic shocks associated with sexual
violence and facilitate some aspects of survivors' subjective
well-being. Shobe and Page-Adams (2001) argue that assets
"provide people with otherwise unattainable opportunities to
hope, plan, and dream about the future," which improves
their social and economic well-being (p. 119). In contrast,
they argue, asset-poor people must work to make ends meet
on a "day-to-day basis." Asset-poor survivors must similarly
cope with the aftermath of assault on a day-to-day basis,
which makes them more vulnerable to the financial shocks
that can follow rape. Those who own assets, meanwhile,
have the opportunities to plan for the future, to be flexible in
their response to unexpected occurrences, and to take com-
fort in the knowledge of those plans and options. By allow-
ing them to make decisions and plans, assets can increase
survivors'sense of control over their lives. This sense of con-
trol may be particularly valuable to survivors of sexual vio-
lence, in which the perpetrator takes away the victim's
control over her or his body (Herman, 1992). This is not to
minimize the numerous negative effects of sexual assault for
all survivors, asset owners or no, but rather to suggest that
such ownership may facilitate recovery in important ways.
Second, this study's findings on the value of familial
financial assistance and unequal access to such support
extend asset theory's approach to the intra-familial transmis-
sion of wealth. Shapiro (2004) defines transformative assets
as inherited wealth that lifts a family beyond their own earn-
ings level, such as a single mother whose familial assistance
allows her to live a middle-class lifestyle despite her own
low wages. Familial financial assistance for survivors may
be similarly transformative by opening options that they
could not otherwise afford, such as taking time off from
work or accessing costly medical services. In addition, just
as Shapiro (2004) notes that White families are more likely
to benefit from transformative assets than Black families,
inequalities may also emerge in familial assistance for survi-
vors. In the U.S., families'income and asset levels are highly
unequal by race (Campbell & Kaufman, 2006; Kochhar, Fry,
& Taylor, 2011), suggesting White families are in aggregate
better situated to provide financial assistance to survivors
than are Black, Latino, or Native American families. This
study was unable to assess the degree to which racial differ-
ences exist in familial financial assistance for sexual assault
survivors, but it documented many barriers to familial finan-
cial assistance, including poor families' limited financial
capacity. Future research should examine the impact of racial
wealth inequalities on survivor outcomes.
Third, these findings add complexity to current discus-
sions of homeownership within the asset field. Adherents of
asset theory report that homeownership is associated with a
wide range of benefits to health, well-being, and safety. Yet
in the context of sexual violence, owning one's home appears
to be a mixed blessing. Homeowners may have the option to
leverage their investment to increase stability, but this bene-
fit is tempered by the possibility that a survivor may wish to
move from the home where the assault occurred. In addition,
homeowners can face the same concerns about housing
affordability that arise for renters, but with higher stakes.
These findings suggest a need to turn a more nuanced lens to
the study of homeownership, particularly as it relates to
trauma and recovery.
Policy Recommendations
By noting that asset ownership can help with recovery, this
research identifies a need as well as a potential solution. The
need I identify is that survivors of sexual violence require
economic resources to facilitate recovery. Existing wealth
inequalities mean less privileged survivors may face nega-
tive economic effects of sexual violence disproportionately,
which suggests that policy intervention may be appropriate
to create equitable outcomes. Importantly, many existing
policies address the economic needs of IPV survivors but
exclude survivors of non-IPV sexual violence. If a woman
who is raped by her landlord or her boss deserves the same
financial assistance as one who is raped by her husband, then
existing policies for IPV survivors need to be expanded to
include all sexual assault survivors. The solutions lie not
only in supporting private asset ownership but also in poli-
cies and services that can offer some of the benefits of asset
ownership to asset-poor individuals.
First, IPV services often include economic components,
such as financial assistance, transitional housing, and finan-
cial literacy education (Lyon, Bradshaw, & Menard, 2012).
Yet, financial assistance services for non-IPV sexual assault
survivors are not widely available, as most rape crisis centers
lack the funding and staff to offer such services. State and
federal dollars should be made available to rape crisis service
providers to create economic stabilization funds for sexual
assault survivors. The Office on Violence Against Women
could begin by funding pilot programs to identify best prac-
tices and create a model for nationwide implementation.
Importantly, service providers in the present study reported
that survivors often need relatively small amounts of assis-
tance (approximately US$1,000) to maintain their financial
stability and prevent homelessness. If investing this modest
sum in survivors in the immediate aftermath of trauma could
help prevent a downward spiral, this could ultimately create
savings for the state on homeless services, subsidized hous-
ing, and other welfare programs.
Loya 11
Second, small business development, or microenterprise,
can boost survivors' financial stability and empowerment.
Tailored microenterprise programs have been developed for
IPV survivors (e.g., Pathways to Independence, The
Enterprise Center, 2013; Project Phoenix, Vera House, 2014),
and such programs can provide helpful models for address-
ing the needs of isolated sexual assault survivors.
Microenterprise programs for sexual assault survivors should
include trauma-informed and culturally sensitive training,
mentorship, and seed money. Self-employment may be par-
ticularly appealing for survivors who have been assaulted in
the workplace or who have difficulty continuing their pre-
assault careers for other reasons.
Third, this study's findings suggest that assets can play an
important role in recovery for sexual assault survivors. One
policy strategy for encouraging asset ownership among low-
and moderate-income people is the Individual Development
Account (IDA). IDAs are savings accounts that offer matched
funds for asset-building purposes, such as homeownership,
post-secondary education, or small business. Tailored IDA
programs should be developed for sexual assault survivors,
similar to the ones that exist for IPV survivors (Sanders &
Schnabel, 2006, 2011; Sanders et al., 2007). IDA programs
often include financial education and a peer support struc-
ture. These elements can be designed to address common
concerns of sexual assault survivors, such as fostering peer-
to-peer recovery strategies and sharing information on finan-
cial assistance for crime victims. Beyond asset building, the
goals of these IDAs would be to help survivors both recover
from past violence and feel safer in the future.
Conclusion
This exploratory study has applied the asset framework to
recovery from isolated sexual violence, a problem that is not
often recognized as a source of economic concern for survi-
vors. This study's qualitative approach allows us to learn
from survivors and the people who help them about how
financial resources can help to lighten the economic burden
caused by sexual assault. These findings suggest that liquid
assets and familial financial assistance can help offset post-
assault expenses and can facilitate access to resources that
are helpful for recovery. Specifically, these types of assets
can stand in for lost wages and help cover new expenses that
arise as a result of the violence, such as medical fees, coun-
seling bills, and moving costs. Both owned assets and famil-
ial financial assistance can also convey a sense of security
and control over one's life. Homeownership, however, seems
to have mixed effects. For some survivors, a mortgage can be
leveraged to enhance economic stability, but for others,
homeownership is costly and makes moving difficult.
Survivors do not have equal access to financial and famil-
ial resources. Instead, unequal wealth ownership, as well as
the numerous barriers to familial assistance described in the
findings, place asset-based remedies out of reach for many
survivors. These data suggest that the negative economic
consequences of sexual violence likely burden survivors
with fewer financial resources more heavily than those who
own significant assets. Although private asset ownership
cannot be equalized, public policies for IPV survivors can be
expanded to better meet the economic needs of all sexual
assault survivors.
