Introduction
Essential hypertension (EH) is a complex multifactorial
genetic disease with unknown etiology at the present time.
EH has affected approximately one billion people world-
wide and has become a major health problem globally.1,2
As is well-known, the classical renin-angiotensin-aldoster-
one system (RAAS) mainly includes angiotensinogen,
renin, angiotensin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE),
and aldosterone, playing an important role in the regula-
tion of blood pressure and water-electrolyte homeostasis.
Therefore the genes that encode for the RAAS, have been
selected as causative candidates for EH. Moreover, studies
on candidate-gene-based association are still very popular
for identifying genetic components of EH.3
Renin, as the first enzyme of the RAAS cascade, is an
aspartyl protease synthesized by the juxtaglomerular cells of
the kidney. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin I,
which is further catalyzed to angiotensin II by ACE.
Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and effective stim-
ulator of aldosterone release, thus affecting blood pressure
and electrolyte homeostasis. Thereby, the gene encoding

Abstract
Introduction: The renin gene has been suggested as a good candidate in the study of genetic mechanism of essential
hypertension. However, studies on the contribution of renin gene polymorphisms to essential hypertension, have not
had consistent outcomes. The purpose of the present study is to explore the association of renin gene polymorphisms
with essential hypertension in the Han population of northern China.
Methods: A case-control study was conducted among 3090 Han farmers (1533 essential hypertension patients and 1557
normotensives). Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
and polymerase chain reaction-sequencing.
Results: The genotypic and allelic distributions of rs2368564 in essential hypertension and control was significant
statistically (p<0.001). The allelic distribution of rs10900557 showed marginal statistical significance (p=0.048). There
were no significant differences in other genotypic and allelic distributions (p>0.05). In the haplotypes comprised by the
six single-nucleotide polymorphisms, there were differences in the distribution of haplotypes A-T-C-G-C-A, A-T-C-G-
C-G, G-C-T-G-T-A and G-C-T-G-T-G in both groups, and their differences reached to significant levels, respectively.
After having corrected for false discovery rate, this association still remained significant.
Conclusions: The current study provides evidence for a possible association of renin gene polymorphisms with essential
hypertension in a Han population of northern China.

renin is a good candidate for the study of EH etiology. The
renin gene (REN) is located in chromosome 1q32, 12.5kb in
length with 10 exons and nine introns in coding region.4
In the past two decades, a number of association stud-
ies between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of
REN and EH have been performed, but unfortunately,
results have been inconsistent. Frossard et al.5­7 discov-
ered MboI and BglI polymorphisms, and their haplo-
types had a significant association with EH among the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) and US Caucasian popula-
tions. Ahmad et al.8 also found MboI was implicated in
the pathogenesis of EH in Emirati people. However,
Valdez-Velazquez et al.9 found 10607G>A (MboI) and
1303G>A (BglI) had no association with EH in the popu-
lations of Mexicans and Germans. Mohana Vamsi et al.10
indicated that REN MboI polymorphism was not associ-
ated with EH in the South India population. Fu et al.11
showed that there was lack of correlation between MboI
polymorphism and essential hypertension in Japanese.
Afruza R et al.12 found that there was not any distinct
association between BglI, TaqI, MboI, and EH in the
Bangladeshi population. The above-mentioned studies
were all about the REN intron. There were some studies
about other regulatory regions of the REN. In 2010,
Vangjeli et al.13 found that the REN-5312C/T polymor-
phism was associated with increased blood pressure in
the Irish population. Park et al.3 suggested that carriers
of the A allele in rs6682082 were more likely to have
hypertension amongst Korean women. Another aspect of
REN variation was insert/deletion (I/D). Ying et al.14
found REN I/D polymorphism was associated with EH
in the Chinese Mongolian population. Among these
studies, the SNPs in the first and ninth introns were hot
topics. Collectively, the research results were sometimes
inconsistent and contradictory.
In our previous investigation,15 we found that SNPs
were clustered in intron 1. In order to explore the contribu-
tion of this clustered feature to EH and the association of
rs2368564 with EH, we implemented a case-control study
in the Han population of northern China.
Methods
Subjects
Three thousand and ninety Han farmers of northern China
were selected from a large scale of field survey in the Lanxi
county of Heilongjiang province, including 1533 EH
patients and 1557 normotensives (NTs) aged more than 40
years old. The inclusion criteria for EH were: (a) average
systolic blood pressure (SBP)140 mm Hg and/or average
diastolic blood pressure (DBP)90 mm Hg tested on three
separate occasions; (b) although the blood pressure in three
tests had not reached the required scale, the individual had
taken anti-hypertension drugs within the past two weeks.
Subjects with diabetes, stroke, and secondary hypertension
were excluded. The inclusion criteria for controls were:
attending the same field survey, with normal blood pressure,
and not having taken any antihypertensive drugs, excluding
those for diabetes and stroke. All data were collected via
demographic questionnaire, direct measurement, and labo-
ratory examination.
All of the participants were independent and gave
informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the
ethics committees of Harbin Medical University.
Genotyping
Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of periph-
eral venous blood using a commercial Blood Gen Midi kit
(CWBio,China).
Genotyping of 451bp DNA fragment in REN intron 1.Prim-
ers were designed via Primer Premier 5.0 software. The
reference sequences were described in GenBank of human
REN intron 1 (AF213461). The total volume of polymer-
ase chain reaction (PCR) system was 25 l (Supplemen-
tary Material Table 1). An amplification was performed in
Mycycler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, USA). The primer
nucleotide sequence and cycle reaction conditions are
referred to in Supplementary Material Table 2. After the
amplification, PCR products were subjected to 1% agarose
gel electrophoresis for quality detection. The distinct and
bright gel with single band of 451 bp was collected and
then delivered to the commercial company (Huada Gene
Company, Beijing, China) for DNA sequencing via the
dideoxy chain termination method. Sequencing results
were read with two software packages, DNAStar and
Chromas respectively.
Genotyping of rs2368564.Primers are referred to in the
Frossard et al. study.5 The cycle condition is summarized
in Supplementary Material Table 2. Subsequent to amplifi-
cation, PCR products were subjected to 1% agarose gel
electrophoresis to detect the quality. The clear band of 250
bp could be subjected to digestion using restriction endo-
nuclease MboI. A quantity of 20 l of digestion mixture
included 10 l PCR products, 0.6 l MboI restriction endo-
nuclease (3U), 2 l New England Biolabs (NBE) buffer
and 7.4 l double distilled water (ddH2
O), which was incu-
bated at 37°C for one hour. The digested products were
genotyped on 3% agarose gel electrophoresis using the
500 bp ladder as standard.
Data analyses
Data analyses were performed with Statistical Analysis
Software (SAS) version 9.1.3. Values were expressed as
numbers, percentages, mean±standard deviation (SD).
Demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed
Zhang et al. 3
by Student's t-test (enumeration data) or 2 test (measure-
ment data). Genotype frequencies were measured via
SHEsis online software (http://analysis.bio-x.cn/myAnal-
ysis.php), to confirm whether they accorded with Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). If they corresponded with
HWE (p>0.05), further analysis could be carried out by
subsequent 2 test and logistic regression, which were uti-
lized to analyze the genotypes and alleles distribution in
both case and control. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
analysis was adopted to evaluate the distributional differ-
ences of SBP or DBP in three genotypes, based on SNP
and group. SHEsis online software was employed to ana-
lyze the haplotype distribution in both groups. The false
discovery rate (FDR) was applied to correct multiple
hypothesis testing.16­18 The FDR significance threshold
was defined as the value of 0.20.19
Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics of
subjects
A total of 3090 individuals, 1533 patients with EH and
1557 controls, participated in this study. Their demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics are illustrated in
Table 1. Variables with significant differences between
the two groups were age, abdominal circumference
(AC), body mass index (BMI), triglyceride (TG), high-
density lipoprotein (HDL), and fasting blood glucose
(FBG). It was demonstrated that age, AC, BMI, TG,
FBG were the risk factors for EH, whereas HDL was a
protective factor for EH.
Genotyping
PCR/sequencing of the 451bp DNA fragment in REN
intron 1 revealed five SNPs: 951A>G (rs11240687),
1064T>C (rs2177695), 1091C>T (rs10900557), 1162G>A
(rs10900556), 1200C>T (rs11240686). Chromas technol-
ogy was used to identify homozygous or heterozygous
variants as shown in Figure 1 (taking rs10900557 for
example). Electrophoretic pictures of rs2368564 are
shown in Figure 2.
Analyzing distribution of genotype and allele in
two groups
At first, all genotypes of the six SNPs in the control group
were fitted to the HWE (p>0.05). Genotypes and allele
distributions of six SNPs between patient and control
groups are displayed in Table 2. Among the six SNPs, the
genotypic and allelic distribution of rs2368564 were both
statistically significant (p<0.001, FDR=0.00, adjusted by
age, family history of EH, gender, AC, BMI, TG, HDL
and FBG). In the other five SNPs, only allelic distribution
of rs10900557 was statistically significant (p=0.048,
FDR=0.14). The result in Table 2 shows that, compared to
GG genotype, GA and AA genotypes were statistically
associated with the risk of EH, with odds ratios (ORs)
(95% confidence interval (CIs)): 1.97 (1.63­2.38) and
3.63 (1.96­6.71), respectively. Moreover, dominant
model analysis disclosed that the dominant model (GG
versus AA+GA) had a statistically significant difference
between EH and NT groups (FDR=0.00). The proportion
of EH was 60.8% in genotype AA or GA carriers, and
45.0% in the genotype GG.
Analysis of haplotypes
The analysis of linkage disequilibrium showed its rela-
tionship among five clustered SNPs, D'>0.8
(Supplementary Material Figure). There were only three
haplotypes (A-C-C-A-C, A-T-C-G-C, G-C-T-G-T) con-
sisting of the five SNPs, of which their frequencies were
more than 3% in EH or NT group. The distributional dif-
ferences of the three haplotypes between two groups had
no statistical significance. However, their effect was
observed after they were connected with alleles of
rs2368564. There were six haplotypes, of which frequen-
cies were more than 3% in EH or NT group (Table 3). The
distributional differences of the six haplotypes between

the two groups, except for haplotypes H1 and H2, reached

Discussion
In China, the prevalence of hypertension decreases from
north to south. All the participants in this study were from
rural areas of Lanxi County located at 46.27°N latitude,
where the prevalence rate of hypertension was high (the
prevalence was 33.9% in 2014).20 Farmers were selected
as subjects in our study, which could rule out the interfer-
ence of population mobility that might affect the accuracy
of this study. The demographic and clinical characteristics
between EH and NT showed that age, AC, BMI, TG, FBG
were the risk factors, while HDL was the protective factor
for EH, findings which were consistent with other
researchers.21,22
In recent decades, substantial association studies of
REN polymorphism with EH were conducted. More so, the
research results could not be repeated for the geographical
and genetic heterogenicity of EH. There was a lot of previ-
ous research on the REN intron 1 polymorphism with EH,
but almost no study involved the clustered variants that
were shown in the current investigation. Hopefully, this
can be a new direction in future research.
The analyses of genotype and allele suggested that
rs2368564 polymorphism was significantly associated
with EH in the Han population of northern China. The fre-
quency of the A allele was EH 19.6% vs NT 12.0% respec-
tively. The OR (95% CI) was 1.79 (1.52­2.11), which
implied that the variant A was the risk factor for EH.

Moreover, the dominant model analysis revealed that the
risk to EH with genotype AA or GA was higher than that
with genotype GG. However, the analyses of genotype and
allele of the other five SNPs clustered in the intron 1
showed no association with EH.
By the analysis of haplotype, 26 haplotypes were found
in whole subjects. But there were only six haplotypes, of
which frequencies were more than 3% in EH or NT. The
distributions of haplotypes H3, H4, H5, and H6 between
cases and controls revealed a significant association
(p<0.05, FDR<0.2). The OR values of haplotypes H3 and
H5 were more than 1.2, which were consistent with the
single site rs2368564, and confirmed that allele A was the
risk factor for EH. Moreover, the five clustered SNPs
could increase the risk of single allele A for EH, because
the OR values of haplotypes H3 and H5 were 2.0 and 2.8,
both more than 1.8. The OR values of haplotypes H4 and
H6 were less than 0.9, which also proved that allele G was
the protective factor for EH. The analysis of haplotypes
implied that taking six SNPs simultaneously could enable
us to find the association with EH. Haplotypes H3 and H5
would increase the risk of EH, while haplotypes H4 and
H6 would protect people from getting EH.
There were several limitations in our study. First, it is
better to randomly select SNPs in the whole gene when
analyzing the contribution of haplotype to disease.
However, in order to explore the contribution of clustered
SNPs in intron 1 to EH, we chose five SNPs that were clus-
tered in intron 1, while rs2368564 is sited in intron 9. Thus,
the next step we need to do is to study the SNPs sited in the
5'-control region and other introns. Second, confirmative
studies in other ethnic groups need to be performed.
In conclusion, we have preliminarily shown the signifi-
cant association between rs2368564 and EH and ascer-
tained that the variant A of rs2368564 was the risk factor
for EH in the Han population of northern China.
Furthermore, we found that haplotypes A-T-C-G-C-A,
A-T-C-G-C-G, G-C-T-G-T-A and G-C-T-G-T-G out of
REN intron 1 and intron 9, contributed to the development
of EH in the Han population of northern China. We believe
that further studies about the interaction of more SNPs in
RAAS can help to elucidate the genetic mechanism of EH.
