Introduction
Definitions of and about music abound, each favoring the
angle(s) that would suit and support the objectives of the
scholar. Angles such as aesthetic, emotive, symbolic, psy-
chic, cathartic, cryptic, normative, perfunctory, and meta-
physical have all been covered in manifold definitions of and
about music; yet, a consideration of music as a mere sonic
material presents music as the conscious and, at times, fortu-
itous combination of individual notes that appear succes-
sively (melody) or simultaneously (harmony), or even both.
The foregoing is true whether the medium of music-making
is vocal, instrumental, or vocal­instrumental.
Music-making, therefore, is a global practice, but what is
arguable is that music is, solely, a human practice. The argu-
ment arises from expressions such as "music of the spheres,"
"celestial music," "music of the gods," "music of the spirits,"
"mating songs and dances of certain animals," "songs of
birds," "musical cry of hounds," and "musical murmur of
brooks." It is in support of renegotiating the musical sound-
scape that Schafer (1974) writes,
Today all sounds belong to a continuous field of possibilities
lying within the comprehensive dominion of music:
Behold the new orchestra: the sonic universe!
And the new musicians: anyone and anything that sounds!
There is a shattering corollary to this for all music educators.
For music educators are the custodians of the theory and practice
of music.
And the whole nature of this theory and practice is now going to
have to be completely reconsidered. (p. 2)
It is in this proposal for a renegotiation and complete
reconsideration of the theory and practice of music that the
present study of the philosophical angle of the folk songs of
the Igbo finds fascination. This fascination stems from the
fact that the folk music of the Igbo is a communion shared by
the supernatural, the supra-terrestrial, the human, and the
sub-human (Gracyk, 2008; Nzewi, 1980; Onwuegbuna,
2012). Umezinwa (2009) corroborates the foregoing as he
informs,
Igbo music is more than mere music. To the owners and
practitioners, it is a living force that yields to various forms of
meanings and interpretations. It is just not one thing but many
things reviewed from a prism, which unifies all . . .At once, Igbo
music becomes a philosophy, metaphysics. (p. 128)
Education of the Igbo child is, therefore, a sacred duty con-
ducted through music--along with other media of transmission.

Philosophical Embodiments in Igbo Music:
An Analysis of Mike Ejeagha's "Popular"
Folk Songs Style
Ikenna Emmanuel Onwuegbuna1
Abstract
The omnipresence of music in the human society and its utilitarian stance in the human life make the study of its philosophical
tilt a necessity. Although the functionality of music can be ascertained from a myriad of perspectives, it is in the textual
content and performance practices of folk songs that the general world view of a people is exposed. Through contemplation,
appreciation, and analytical approaches, this research report reveals some of the set ideas, views, opinions, beliefs, and norms
of the Igbo about the cosmos, nature, and providence, embodied in the folk songs of Mike Ejeagha--a folkloric popular
musician of that regional extraction.

Philosophy
Conceptually, philosophy can be considered to be man's crit-
ical approach to the acquisition and coordination of knowl-
edge of his universe, using tools such as thought, logic, and
transcendental means to demystify the so-called mysteries
behind beingness, existence, reality, and nature. It also cov-
ers a set or system of ideas, opinions, beliefs, or principles of
man's behavior based on an overall understanding of his
existence and the universe (Encarta Encyclopedia, 2013;
Nwala, 2007; Nze, in Okolo, 1993; Oxford Talking
Dictionary, 1998). Much as professional philosophers are in
disagreement over a globally acceptable definition of phi-
losophy, some definitions still carry their weight in the field
of philosophical studies. One such definition is that of a fore-
most professor of philosophy, Nwala (2007), who argues,
No definition of philosophy can be complete without taking into
account the nature of the more traditional world views, the
product of ancient sages and the critical mass reflections and
nature of reality including the nature of world views. (p. 21)
Much as there are diverse views about the definition of
philosophy, its regional application has never been as con-
testable as its interpretative and pedagogic approaches. This
accounts for why we have medieval philosophy, Greek phi-
losophy, Chinese philosophy, Indian philosophy, Islamic phi-
losophy, Western philosophy, African philosophy, and Igbo
philosophy. It is the latter that is, indeed, the thrust of the
current discourse.
Philosophy as it concerns the Igbo would, naturally, give
insights into the Igbo general world view about the people,
their religion, art, language, culture, morals, social organiza-
tions, belief patterns, divinity, time, matter, energy, space,
and life generally; mostly in consonance with African phi-
losophy--part and parcel of which the Igbo is (Nwala, 1985;
Okafor & Emeka, 2004; Okafor, Nwokike, Eziechi, &
Egudu, 1999; Opata, 1998).
Igbo Music
The enterprising Igbo merchants of Southeastern Nigeria
were known worldwide for their commerce and industry.
Their ingenious transactions with Portuguese and British
trade partners led to the establishment of international mer-
cantile firms such as the United African Company.,John
Holt, P.Z., Miller Brothers, and Compagnie Française de
l'Afrique de l'Ouest in Nigeria today. It is also to their credit
that international markets in Onitsha, Aba, Nnewi, and Port
Harcourt and many road networks, rail lines, airports, and
seaports were constructed to favor access to commercial and
industrial areas of Nigeria (Ozigbo, 1999).
Exotic in taste, lovers of innovation, and explorers of
opportunity, Igbo merchants brought home fascinating items
and practices of the various foreign cultures they had had
contact with. Such items and practices included dress, lan-
guage, music, religion, and manipulated ethnicity (Collins &
Richards, 1982). The foundation for the development of the
Nigerian first popular genre with national appeal was laid by
the ubiquitous Igbo minstrels who combined elements of
their entertainment music of igede, ifo, nkwa, egwu-une,
egwu-amala, and so on, to form the initial neo-folk, native
blues styles of dodokido and akk n'egwu--the precursors
of Nigerian Highlife (Okoro, 1993; Okafor, 2005;
Onwuegbuna, 2011).
The musical proceeds of these culture contacts between
the Igbo and her immediate and distant neighbors form a cor-
nerstone in the musical style of Mike Ejeagha, the subject of
the current discourse. Akk n'egwu, the folkloric popular
musical style is one of the major proceeds of this culture con-
tact, and it was Mike Ejeagha who popularized it. The major
musical instruments that accompany the Ejeagha's akk
n'egwu include the Western guitar, chaka (beaded-gourd
rattles), kpkl (wooden claves), and gba (membrane
drums).
The justification for locating Ejeagha's Akk N'Egwu
within the matrix of Igbo cultural contact with her neighbors
and foreigners is contained in the fact that urbanization and
industrialization, the offshoots of 19th century global mod-
ernization, and territorial expansion for commercialization
of the excess products of some rich and powerful European
nations, led to the disruption of traditional attitudes and life-
styles of the African nations. Different ethnic groups
migrated to the urban centers to form a stratified society
based on socioeconomic status. This new social order dif-
fered widely from the traditional homogeneous ethnic set-
tings. In expressing their musical artistry, these urban
dwellers, drawn from different ethnic backgrounds, created a
syncretic urban neo-folk music classified as Interethnic pop
styles. In its unfolding as causes and effects in the time­
space structure, the definitive peculiarities of this form
include the use of foreign musical instruments, expressions,
and recording technology. This moves the cultural practice
beyond oral tradition to audio recording--what Goodman
(2008) aptly captures as "From Village to Vinyl." The fore-
going is true about Ejeagha's Akk N'Egwu.
Mike Ejeagha: The Musician
Michael Nwachukwu Okolo Ejeagha (a.k.a.Gentleman Mike
Ejeagha) was born in the month of August, 1932. He hails
from Imezi-Owa, in the Ezeagu Local Government Area of
Enugu State. Upon completion of his primary school educa-
tion in 1948, Ejeagha started learning how to play the acous-
tic guitar under the tutelage of Moses "Moscow" Aduba and
Cyprian Uzochiawa--taking advantage of his proximity to
these professional guitarists with whom he shared a common
neighborhood at Coal Camp, in Enugu.
Onwuegbuna 3
After his apprenticeship under the Paradise Hotel's
Rhythm Orchestra, in Enugu, Ejegha's professional career as
a musician took off in the 1950s with his Mike Ejeagha and
Merry-Makers Band. The band later transformed into the
Premier Dance Band in the 1960s and has grown from
strength to strength since then. So far, Ejeagha has more than
33 record albums and four singles--in the forms of vinyl,
CDs, VCDs, and cassette tapes--to his credit (Nwagbo,
2009).
Ejeagha's compositional rationalization bestrides the cre-
ative and methodical thoughts involved in composing most
folk songs. These creative thoughts are determined and
shaped by the society's musical system, and influenced by
the society's folk musical thought and rules regarding inspi-
ration and fantasy. What Ejeagha does, in line with the fore-
going, therefore, is to rearrange some extant Igbo folk songs
to suit his akk n'egwu medium of presentation as well as
accommodate the limitations of his choice of musical instru-
ments for performance.
Mike Ejeagha: The Music, the Songs
With the definitions of music, folk (also traditional) music,
and popular music already given in the foregoing exposé, it
is equally necessary to look closely at the word song. A song
is a musical experience, expression, or composition that
involves the setting of text to melody for vocal performance.
Such texts are often metrically composed verses, which
account for why they readily lend themselves to melodic
interpretations. They may or may not be accompanied by
musical instruments. However, some of such songs are, at
times, delivered through the medium of musical instruments.
They are still identified as songs because they retain their
text-driven melodic expressions (Apel, 1964; Oxford Talking
Dictionary, 1998). The implication of the aforesaid is that
there could be music without song, but all songs still remain
music. However, the Igbo use the term egwu in a generic
sense for various musical activities. They include music,
song, dance, games, drama, festival, and banter. Hence, there
are activities as follows:
1. Egwu Imo Awka--­Imo Awka festival,
2. Egwu nwa--moonlight plays,
3. Egwu ekpili--ekpili music,
4. Egwu maz--children's games,
5. Egwu okolba--youthful banter, and
6. Egwu nyanga--graceful dance.
In the case of Mike Ejeagha, while his style of music--the
akk n'egwu--falls within the popular class, his songs are
still redolent of the folk. The modal melodies, the country-
side lyrical contents, and the close-knitted intervallic ambi-
ence of his songs are evident features of the African folk
tunes. Akk n'egwu, the literal translation of which is "story
in song," is delivered in a vocal technique that employs an
interchange of speaking and singing, couched in folkloric
musical activities--a practice that is often linked with the
griots, the folk poet­musician­historians of North and West
African regions. These explain why Ejeagha is here referred
to as the folkloric popular musician.
The Song Texts
Song 1: Omekag
Opi m fugbuelum Omekag; Opi m fugbuelum Omekag
My horn, please, blow Omekagu to death
Omekag lil' ji Mm; Omekag lil' ede Mm
Omekag ate the yam of the Spirit; Omekag ate the cocoyam of
the Spirit
b' n'ifugbuelum Omekag, fugbuelum Omekag
If you could just blow Omekag to death, blow Omekag to
death
Ka m wel' ebini gwa yi aka
So I could sacrifice a ram in appreciation
b' n'ifugbuelum Omekag, fugbuelum Omekag
If you could just blow Omekag to death, blow Omekag to
death
Ka m wel' ebini gwa yi aka
So I could sacrifice a ram in appreciation
Ma g jide ogu, jide f; Ma g jide ogu, jidekwa f
But ensure you are just and fair; but ensure you are truly just and
fair.
Oh ghoo, oh gho-oghoo; Oh ghoo, oh gho-oghoo!
A summary of the story behind this song goes as follows:
The King, upon envisaging his imminent death from old age,
assembled the elders and council of chiefs of his kingdom to
introduce to them the heir apparent to the throne. But instead
of presenting his first son, as the custom of the land stipu-
lates, the King presented his younger son, named Omekag.
His reason was that he loved Omekag better--whom he had
often praised beyond the skies; thereby spoiling him. This
unjust deprivation of the right of primogeniture of the first
son was unacceptable to the elders and chiefs, who walked
out on their King in disapproval. The King, adamantly,
paraded Omekag to his community on the appointed market
day. It was as this parade progressed that his aggrieved first
son picked up the magical horn he received from the Spirit
land and sounded the quoted song. The result: The horn did
as was implored, striking Omekag to death; the King and
the entire community apologized to the first son; he reversed
the song of his magical horn; Omekag resurrected; the
rightful heir was reinstated; and peace and harmony were
restored to the community.
Some of the symbols in the song include the following:
1. Omekag--the leopard brand (a name and an item of
characterization),
2. Opu--musical horn (voice and power of the Spirits),
3. f na Ogu--justice and fair-play,
4. Ebini--Ram (forbearance and resilience),
4 SAGE Open
5. Eze--King (spiritual and temporal ruler, custodian of
Omenan),
6. Ji na ede--Yam and cocoyam (totality of the agrarian
economy of the Igbo).
The philosophy therein. The song, Omekag, is Number 1 in
the Omenan series by Mike Ejeagha. Omenan (also
Omenana, Omenal, or Omenala) stipulates, assigns, inter-
prets, and orders in totality, the norms and values of the Igbo
(Ekwunife, 1997; Nwala, 1985; Opata, 1998; Ozigbo, 1999;
Umeh, 1999). Looking at Omenan as what accords to the
customs and traditions of the Igbo, Nwala (1985) writes,
Omenala includes major beliefs about the origin of the universe
and its nature, the place of the spirits, deities, man and other
beings in the universe, the nature or character of taboos,
regulations, prescriptions and prohibitions as to what is proper
in such a universe--rules of marriage, sexual intercourse,
attitudes to strangers--and forms of social relationship, as well
as the realm of simple decency and etiquette. Indeed, Omenala
is a body of law and morals along with their metaphysical
foundations. (p. 27)
Injustice is a negation of Omenan, and when it is done by
the custodian of the Omenan himself, the Spirits of the land
would wade in on the living to defend the offended. As long
as the oppressed is on the side of justice and fair-play, he is
always assured of the intercession of the Spirits. The face-
lessness of both the king and his first son (none of whose
names were given in the story) speaks volumes about the
impartiality of the Spirits in administering justice. Ma g jide
ogu, jidekwa f--But ensure that you are truly just and fair!
It is this disposition of justice and fair-play that gave the
oppressed the qualification to "receive" the magical horn
from the Spirits. The communion of the living and the dead
(the immortal Spirit-Ancestors) is not a mere belief in the life
of the Igbo; it is a reality. Hence, Arazu (as cited in Umeh,
1999) concurs,
Igbo realization (not belief) of the existence of that which is
beyond the material, that which supports and modifies the
material, that which is the ultimate basis for the phenomenon of
life (Ndu) manifesting in matter, is expressed in the term Mm.
When man puts off his material cocoon at what is called death
(nw), he continues to exist on the other side of existence in a
life that is not cut off from relationships and mutual influences
with the world of the bodily senses of those who are on this side.
(p. 22)
To further justify his claim to fair-play, and therefore, his
qualification to receive divine assistance, the oppressed had
to inform that Omekag lil'ji Mm; Omekag lil'ede Mm
(Omekag ate the yam of the Spirit; Omekag ate the
cocoyam of the Spirit). It is mere foolhardiness for a mortal
to pounce on the entire economic wealth of the Spirits--as
equated to Omekag's crime against the land. This is a highly
philosophical allusion, for, according to Nwala (1985), "In
Igbo traditional society we find evidence of economic factors
reciprocably interacting with religious and philosophical
ideas" (p.176). And touching on gender-sensitive issues,
while yam represents the entire economic wealth of the male,
and cocoyam represents the entire economic wealth of the
female Spirits, a distress call from an oppressed mortal, with
this form of allusion, would surely put the Spirits on the dou-
ble to help. And it did!
Most religious doctrines uphold the idea that divine utter-
ance is heard as sound. In the Igbo cosmology, this sound is
musical. Spirits speak to mortals via coded musical sounds,
the meaning of which can only be deciphered by the Afa
priests and the initiated. The nonlexical syllables (often,
erroneously, termed nonsense vocables) are actually the
coded language of the Spirits, and the onomatopoeic Oh
ghoo, oh gho-oghoo is, in effect, the voice of the Spirits
speaking through the medium of the magical horn that was
"received" by the oppressed heir.
Ka m wel' ebini gwa yi aka (So I could sacrifice a ram in
appreciation) is a figurative expression that conveys the
meaning, "So I could forbear and defeat my assailant without
violence." This underscores the Igbo's belief in nonviolent
resistance to evil and injustice. Rather than take the laws into
his hands, the Igbo would seek divine intervention in matters
of misunderstandings and disagreements. This philosophy is
borne in the name China (i.e., Chi nal m g)--Let my
personal God fight the fight for me.
The issue of postmortem among the Igbo is more spiritual
than physiological. The cause of physical death of humans is
often traced back to the Spirits, and not just the disease that
may have ravaged only the body. This philosophy is
expressed in the Igbo adage: A chba isi ch e jee n'z
(literarily, "If you want to trace the cause of the murder/man-
slaughter, you go to the blacksmith"). The idea is that it was
the blacksmith that manufactured the weapon with which the
crime was committed. In the case of Omekag, it was the
consultation with the Afa priest that revealed that his sudden
death was due to his connivance with his father, the King, to
dispossess his elder brother, the rightful heir, of his right of
primogeniture.
Omekag, as the title of the song as well as the name of
the protagonist, also stands as an item of imagery and char-
acterization. Literarily meaning "the leopard-brand,"
Omekag images a spoiled-brat who gloats about in a devil-
may-care attitude. His destination is quite predictable: disas-
ter, not minding that he may have the backing of the "High
and Mighty." The moral of this imagery is central to Igbo
philosophy of childbearing and rearing. Humility is a virtue,
and pride is a vice. For this reason, Ejeagha warns against
otuto ntoghu na-egbu nwankta (the highly bloated praises
that lead the dog to its untimely death).
In all, the Omekag story-in-song (akk n'egwu) has
touched on the entire aspects of what Ekwunife (1997) calls
the quinquagram of Igbo traditional religious cultural
Onwuegbuna 5
values. They include life (nd), offspring (mm), wealth
(ak na ba), peace (udo), and love (fnanya). The death
and resurrection of Omekag provide insights into life as a
supreme value in the Igbo nation. The presence and activities
of the two sons (offspring) of the King can be easily seen as
the hub upon which the whole story is built. The value of
wealth (as typified in the throne) can also be appreciated by
the conflicts that arose from dispossessing the rightful heir
apparent to the throne. For the love of peace, the subjects
boldly disagreed with their King, notwithstanding his power
and might. Eventually, it was fraternal love that assuaged the
pains of the offended prince, which led to his act of reversing
his request of the Spirits.
Song 2: Nwa Bu Onyinye Chukwu
banuju eeh--ehee! banuju eeh!!
Tal nnukwu aff na be diya maka ifi nwa.
Suffered a great deal in her husband's house due to childlessness.
Mana O mesl nba di z, wee mta m saa.
But she latter remarried and begot seven children.
Ifele b nke onye? Ifele b nke di mb.
Whose then is the shame? The shame is on the first husband.
Biko, b'achkwa unye g na nwa b onyinye Chukwu.
Please, do not sack your wife because, childbearing is the gift of
God.
The story. banuju got married to a husband (di) who, soon
afterward, started mounting pressures on her to give him off-
springs. Under the pressurized situation, banuju could not
conceive, and this caused the husband to lose his patience
and resorted to maltreating her. This situation endured for a
long time until banuju packed out of her husband's house
and remarried. It was in this latter marriage that she begot
seven children, thereby leaving the former husband in shame
and disrepute.
Some of the symbols in the song include,
1. banuju--one that arrives in time of abundance (a
name and an item of characterization).
2. Di--husband (patience).
3. Nwa--offspring (succession, perpetuation of lineage,
true-wealth).
4. saa--seven (fullness of a major cycle in Igbo
numerology).
The philosophy therein. The entire story of banuju is fore-
shadowed by irony. The irony of the name banuju (one
that arrives in/with abundance of wealth) could not be deci-
phered by the husband, whose titular status is "patience" (di
b ndidi). In his impetuous temperament, he impeded and
eventually chased away the potent true-wealth in his wife,
banuju. The manifestation and realization of the full
potentials of banuju had to wait until she found courage to
quit her impatient husband and married a truly patient one (di
b ndidi). Part of Igbo philosophy is that one's given name
would fit and shield the one like a cloak, only when the one
understands the full import of the name. Ejeagha, in line with
this philosophy, sings Onye lie afa  s na nke ya kas nma
(When one benefits from the full imports of his name, he
acclaims that his is the best).
The issue of the offspring comes up again in this song.
Nwa, as a great value symbolizing succession, perpetuation
of family lineage, and true-wealth, is the central theme of
this song. z e ji nwa adgh echi echi (the path that is
cleared with offsprings is never terminated) is an Igbo adage
that supports the philosophy of nwa among the Igbo. The
absence of offsprings in banuju's first marriage was
responsible for her woes; the presence of offsprings in her
second marriage restored her dignity. Mere (as cited in
Ekwunife, 1997) agrees,
Traditionally children are highly valued. They have to continue
the ancestral line in order to retain the family's ownership of
whatever property belongs to it. The reality of family extinction
cannot be ducked where children are not forthcoming. Such a
situation is socially abominable. On the part of any Igbo parents,
having children wards off the anxiety of growing old and fear of
loss of property to undeserving fellows. (p. 77)
saa (also asaa), which is the number "7," is very impor-
tant in Igbo numerology. It represents the fullness of a major
cycle in the philosophy of the Igbo. Izu n'asaa (seven weeks),
nwa n'asaa (seven months), mmili n'asaa (seven seas), and
ag n'asaa (seven forests) are all Igbo expressions regarding
space and time, and the asaa (or saa) here underscores the
centrality of the Number 7 in Igbo philosophy of numbers as
symbols of reality. For instance, 1 month (28 days), which is
made up of 7 weeks (1 week being 4 days) is calculated as 4
× 7 = 28; to travel to the Spirit land, the traveler has to cover
seven seas and seven forests in his travel. This philosophy of
fullness of cycle is inherent in Ejeagha's story of Nwa Bu
Onyinye Chukwu, woven around the character of banuju
and her birth of seven children.
Song 3: Udegbunam
Ude . . . Udegbunam; ude ndma, Ude!
Ude . . . Udegbunam; fame of the good people, Ude!
Nneg s g ejene zala g'agbue akw, Ude!
Your mother asked you not to go to the wilderness to harvest
palm fruit.
Nnag s g ejene zala g'agbue akw, Ude!
Your father asked you not to go to the wilderness to harvest palm
fruit.
I kachie nti jebe.
In disobedience you went.
Malkwa na mgba abl g, mgba ndmm,
Be aware that a wrestling match that turns into a fight is a fight
against the Spirits
Udegbunam, Ude!
6 SAGE Open
The philosophy therein. The child that dares his parents (and,
as a matter of fact, his elders) is regarded as one who is so
callous as to challenge the Spirits to a bout. The counsel of
elders is considered the wisdom of the ancestors, and a brash
negation of their admonition often leads to adverse repercus-
sions. A supporting adage says that what an elder sees from
his humble stead under a tree, a child would climb the top of
the tree without seeing anything.
Conclusion
The utilitarian and contingent functions of music--espe-
cially in Africa--put music in the center stage of therapy,
worship, patriotism, social mobilization and control, enlight-
enment, commerce, transcendental supplication, national
development, and philosophy. Music, when composed and
performed with full complements of its cultural flavors, has
a carny way of engaging the lives of its consumers in an
intense emotional and mental absorption. Beyond the text,
dance, drama, art, and poetry, Igbo folk songs also embody
philosophies that are as personal to the musicians as they are
universal to the contemplators. In aggregation, the Igbo folk
songs embody various dimensions of philosophy with global
relevance and appeal. Personal opinions held by individual
artistes or groups form the bulk of the ideological stance of
such musicians. These opinions could be philosophical, reli-
gious, spiritual, political, interpersonal relationships, and the
total world view of the artistes, which are revealed in the
lyrics (including determinate associations of instrumental
melodies), personality image of the artistes, and their style of
usage of polyglottism.
To benefit the most from these songs, the contemplator of
the art would need to have a thorough knowledge of the lan-
guage and culture of the Igbo. The job of accessing this artis-
tic treasure would become easier when ethnomusicologists,
linguists, philosophers, historians, and specialist scholars
gather, articulate, and systematize the instructional value of
the philosophy embodied in these songs, and introduce the
same to related disciplines in the humanities and social sci-
ences for sincere, serious, and vigorous academic teaching
and learning. Until this is done, professional philosophers
and scholars of African descent may never realize how much
disservice they are doing to their continent and her posterity
through their conscious or sub-conscious neglect of this
unique and lucrative cultural heritage.
