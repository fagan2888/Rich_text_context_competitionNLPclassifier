Abstract
Objectives: To examine associations between red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and organ
involvement and disease activity in patients with Behc
¸et's disease.
Methods: Haematological and inflammatory parameters including RDW, high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were examined in patients
with Behc
¸et's disease and in healthy controls. Patients were divided into those with active or
inactive disease.
Results: Data from 236 patients with Behc
¸et's disease (77 with active and 159 with inactive
disease) and 72 controls were analysed. RDW, ESR and hsCRP were significantly higher in patients
with Behc
¸et's disease than in controls, and in those with active disease compared with inactive
disease or controls. In addition, ESR and hsCRP were significantly higher in those with inactive
disease than controls. No correlations were found between hsCRP, ESR and RDW. No differences
were observed in RDW, ESR or hsCRP between patients with or without ocular or vascular
involvement. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that RDW was significantly higher in
active disease compared with inactive disease.
Conclusions: RDW was increased in active disease compared with inactive disease. No
relationships were found between organ involvement and RDW. RDW may be a cost-effective,
novel potential parameter to evaluate disease activity in Behc
¸et's disease.

Introduction
Haematology autoanalysers not only
count and size circulating cells but also
determine cell volume and variation in cell
size.1 The red blood cell distribution width
(RDW; also known as the red blood cell
distribution width-coefficient of variation)
is an indicator of erythrocyte heterogen-
eity or anisocytosis. It is calculated by
dividing the standard deviation of the
mean cell size by the mean cell volume
of red blood cells and multiplying by 100
to convert to a percentage.2 An elevated
RDW can be seen in diseases such as
anaemia, renal dysfunction, thyroid dis-
ease, hepatic dysfunction, nutritional defi-
ciencies (iron, vitamin B12
and folic acid),
bone marrow dysfunction, cancer, diabetes
mellitus and inflammatory disease.3
Studies report that RDW was associated
with inflammatory indices such as
C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR).4­7
Behc
¸ et's disease is a chronic, recurrent,
multisystemic inflammatory disorder. It is
characterized by involvement of the muco-
cutaneous, urogenital, ocular, vascular,
locomotor, neurological, gastrointestinal
and respiratory systems, and inflammatory
attacks.8 Both ESR and CRP have been
used to assess activity in Behc
¸ et's disease.9
Although other investigational markers
have been identified, they are not routinely
used in clinical practice since they are not
easily measured and clinical values have not
been established.10,11
The aim of the present study was to
investigate whether RDW may have poten-
tial as a diagnostic marker in Behc
¸ et's
disease by examining associations between
RDW, organ involvement and disease
activity.
Patients and methods
Patients
Patients with Behc
¸ et's disease were
identified retrospectively from the database
of the Rheumatology Department, Faculty
of Medicine, Gaziantep University,
Gaziantep, Turkey. The study was con-
ducted between January 2007 and August
2013. Patients were diagnosed according to
the International Study Group criteria for
Behc
¸ et's disease.12 Exclusion criteria
included autoimmune disease (such as
Sjo
¨ gren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis
and inflammatory bowel disease), malignant
disease, thyroid disease, bone marrow dys-
function, diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal
disease and liver disease. Demographic par-
ameters such as age, sex, clinical features
and organ involvement were obtained from
patient records. Controls consisted of
healthy volunteers who were recruited pro-
spectively from members of hospital staff or
patients' relatives. Patients and controls
were age- and sex-matched.
Written consent had been obtained from
all patients as standard practice on admis-
sion to hospital, covering the use of their
data for research purposes. All controls gave
written informed consent when recruited.
The study protocol was approved by the
Clinical Research Ethics Committee of
Gaziantep University (no. 40/2013) and
conducted according to the Declaration of
Helsinki.
Patients with Behc
¸ et's disease were
divided into those with active disease and
those with inactive disease, using the
766 Journal of International Medical Research 43(6)
Turkish version of the simplified Behc
¸ et's
Disease Current Activity Form
(BDCAF).13,14 Active disease was defined
as a BDCAF value !2. Those with active
disease were being treated with standard
regimens, involving immunosuppressive and
anti-inflammatory drugs.
Laboratory measurements
Complete blood count, high-sensitivity CRP
(hsCRP) level and ESR were measured.
Blood samples were obtained following an
overnight fast and were drawn from the
antecubital vein for immediate analysis.
Blood assayed for hsCRP was collected in
standard serum gel biochemistry tubes.
hsCRP levels were measured using an
immunonephelometry assay on a Dade
Behring Nephelometer BN II device
(Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen,
Germany). Blood for ESR measurement
was collected in citrated glass tubes; ESR
was measured using a traditional
Westergren method. Blood collected in
tubes containing ethylenediaminetetra-
acetic acid was analysed to give a complete
blood count, including RDW, haemoglobin,
mean corpuscular volume (MCV), white
blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell
count (RBC), lymphocytes, neutrophils,
haematocrit, mean corpuscular haemoglo-
bin (MCH) and mean corpuscular haemo-
globin concentration (MCHC), using a
Coulter LH 780 device (Beckman Coulter,
Miami, FL, USA).
Statistical analyses
Based on the reference values of RDW for
healthy subjects, the minimum sample size
required was determined as 54 in each group
to demonstrate a significant difference of
1 Æ 2 units between patients with Behc
¸ et's
disease and controls (a ¼ 0.05, 1Àb ¼ 0.80).
Results were given as n patients or
mean Æ SD. The distribution of continuous
variables was evaluated using the
Kolmogorov­Smirnov test. Two normally
distributed variables were compared using
Student's t-test, with Mann­Whitney U-test
being used for non-normally distributed
variables. Analysis of variance and least
significant difference multicomparison tests
were used to compare more than two nor-
mally distributed variables, while Kruskal­
Wallis and pairwise multicomparison meth-
ods were used for non-normally distributed
variables. The 2-test was used for the
analysis of associations between categorical
variables. Pearson's correlation coefficient
test was used for correlation analysis of
hsCRP, ESR, RBC, haemoglobin, MCV
and MCHC against RDW. Multivariate
logistic regression was used to adjust for
the effect of other possible factors. Receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was
performed to assess the ability of RDW to
differentiate patients with Behc
¸ et's disease
from healthy controls and active from
inactive disease. A P-value < 0.05 was con-
sidered to be statistically significant. All
statistical analyses were performed using
IBM SPSSÕ software, version 22 (IBM,
Somers, NY, USA).
Results
A total of 236 patients with Behc
¸ et's disease
(131 male; 105 female) and 72 controls (38
male; 34 female) were included in the study.
Of the patients with Behc
¸ et's disease, 77 had
active disease and 159 had inactive disease.
There were no significant differences in
terms of age and sex between the three
groups (Table 1). RDW, hsCRP and ESR
were significantly higher in patients with
Behc
¸ et's disease than in controls (Table 1).
When analysed according to disease activity,
ESR, hsCRP and RDW were significantly
higher in patients with active Behc
¸ et's dis-
ease than in inactive Behc
¸ et's disease or
controls. In addition, those with inactive
disease had significantly higher ESR and
Aksoy et al. 767
hsCRP levels than controls (Table 1). There
was no significant difference in RDW
between those with inactive disease and
controls. A comparison of RDW values in
the three groups is shown in Figure 1. RBC,
haemoglobin, haematocrit, MCHC, MCH
and MCV levels were significantly lower in
patients with active disease than in those
with inactive disease or controls (Table 1).
There were no significant differences in
neutrophil levels or WBC between patients
with Behc
¸ et's disease and controls (Table 1).
A total of 235 patients with Behc
¸ et's
disease had mucocutaneous manifestations;
of these, 73 also had ocular involvement, 34
had vascular involvement, 12 had locomotor
system involvement, three had gastrointes-
tinal system involvement and nine had
neurological system involvement. When
haematological parameters were compared
in those with or without vascular involve-
ment, WBC, neutrophils, RBC, haemoglo-
bin, haematocrit and MCV were
significantly higher in those with vascular
involvement than in those without, but there
was no significant difference in hsCRP,
ESR, RDW, MCH, MCHC and lympho-
cytes between these two groups (Table 2).
There were no significant differences in any
of the haematological parameters measured
between those with ocular involvement and
those without (Table 2).
There were moderate negative correl-
ations between RDW and haemoglobin
(r ¼ À0.452, P < 0.001), haematocrit (r ¼
À0.479, P < 0.001) and MCV (r ¼ À0.356,

disease. No correlations were found between
RDW and ESR or hsCRP in either active or
inactive disease. There was a moderate
negative correlation between RDW and
MCHC in patients with inactive Behc
¸ et's
disease (r ¼ À0.363, P < 0.001).
Differentiation of patients with Behc
¸ et's
disease from controls, and of active disease
from inactive disease using RDW, was
investigated with ROC analysis.
Comparing patients with Behc
¸ et's disease
and controls, the area under the ROC curve
for RDW was 0.665 Æ 0.0362 for a cut-off
level of > 4% (sensitivity 56.5%; speciEcity
66.7%; P < 0.0001). Comparing patients
with active Behc
¸ et's disease and those with
inactive disease, the area under the ROC
curve for RDW was 0.784 Æ 0.0336 for the
cut-off level of > 14.9% (sensitivity 72%;
speciEcity 78.2%; P < 0.0001). Thus, RDW
was more significant when differentiating
active disease from inactive disease than in
differentiating patients with Behc
¸ et's disease
from controls.
When adjusted for age, sex, CRP,
MCV, ESR and MCHC, RDW values
were not significantly different in patients
with Behc
¸ et's disease compared with con-
trols (Table 3). The adjusted R2 for this
model was 83.2%, meaning that the model
can explain 83.2% of the variation.
However, after adjustment for the same
parameters, significantly higher RDW
values were seen in patients with active
Behc
¸ et's disease compared with those with
inactive disease (Table 3). The adjusted R2
for this model was 56.5%, meaning that
the model can explain 56.5% of the
variation.

Discussion
The present study demonstrated that RDW,
ESR and hsCRP were increased in patients
with Behc
¸ et's disease compared with healthy
controls. In addition, significant increases in
RDW, ESR and hsCRP were observed in
those with active disease compared with
those with inactive disease. Those with
inactive disease also had significantly
higher ESR and hsCRP levels than controls.
There are very few studies evaluating the
relationships between these parameters in
the literature. In a study by Aktu
¨ rk et al.,15
ESR, CRP and RDW were significantly
higher in patients with active Behc
¸ et's dis-
ease than those with inactive Behc
¸ et's dis-
ease or controls. Moreover, they found that
ESR, CRP and RDW were significantly
higher in patients with inactive Behc
¸ et's
disease compared with controls. In addition,
Vaya
´ et al.16 reported that RDW and CRP
were significantly higher in patients with
Behc
¸ et's disease than in controls. The find-
ings of both these studies are consistent with
the results of the present study.
Increased RDW values have been reported
to be associated with disease activity in a
number of inflammatory and autoimmune
diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease,
rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus ery-
thematosus.4­7 In addition, RDW has been
shown to be positively correlated with inflam-
matory indices such as CRP and ESR.17,18
In the present study ESR and hsCRP
were significantly higher in those with active
disease than in those with inactive disease or
controls. However, no correlations were
found between RDW, ESR and hsCRP
within each group. Vaya
´ et al.16 also
reported no correlation between RDW and
several inflammatory parameters in patients
with inactive Behc
¸ et's disease, whereas
Aktu
¨ rk et al.15 found modest positive cor-
relations between ESR, CRP and RDW.
In the present study, increased RDW
levels were associated with Behc
¸ et's disease
activity, but the mechanism is unclear.
Elevated RDW may arise from several
mechanisms such as chronic inflammation,
iron, vitamin B12
or folate deficiencies and
oxidative stress, which may result in inef-
fective erythropoiesis. Among these mech-
anisms, oxidative stress and inflammation
have been shown to be significant determin-
ants of elevated RDW.7,19,20 It has been
suggested that raised levels of the cytokines
interleukin 1, interleukin 6 and tumour
necrosis factor-a in inflammatory diseases
can shorten the lifespan of red blood cells,
leading to an increased RDW.21,22An
increase in RDW may also be caused by
oxidative damage. Several studies have
demonstrated an oxidative response in
patients with Behc
¸ et's disease; as a result
of exposure to oxidative stress, the lifespan
of erythrocytes decreases, production of
reticulocytes increases and the RDW
increases in peripheral blood.23,24
In the present study, significantly higher
RDW values were seen in patients with
active Behc
¸ et's disease compared with
those with inactive disease after multivariate
logistic regression analysis for age, sex,
CRP, MCV, ESR and MCHC. This differ-
ence in RDW was seen even though all the
patients with active disease were receiving
immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory
drugs, which are known to suppress erythro-
cyte stem cells.25 Therefore the main factor
affecting the increase in RDW in those with
active Behc
¸ et's disease is likely to be severe
inflammation and oxidative stress resulting
from disease activity.
Haemoglobin, RBC, haematocrit,
MCHC, MCH and MCV levels were lower
in those with active disease compared to
those with inactive disease. Reductions in
these parameters may also be associated
with anaemia of chronic disease.26 Anaemia
as a chronic disorder has been shown to
reflect disease activity in systemic auto-
immune diseases, with several inflamma-
tory cytokines being implicated in its
pathogenesis.27
Aksoy et al. 771
The present study is the first to examine
the relationship between RDW and organ
involvement in Behc
¸ et's disease. There were
no significant differences in RDW, ESR and
hsCRP between patients with or without
vascular or ocular involvement. In a study
on patients with scleroderma, a significantly
higher RDW was found in patients with
vascular involvement compared with those
without major vascular symptoms.28 In the
present study, WBC, neutrophils, RBC,
haemoglobin, haematocrit and MCV
values were significantly higher in patients
with vascular involvement compared with
patients without. However, all the patients
with vascular involvement were male, which
may have influenced these results. A more
even sex distribution would allow a more
robust analysis of these parameters and
vascular involvement.
A limitation of the present study was the
inclusion of patients with anaemia. No
information was provided relating to levels
of serum folic acid, iron or vitamin B12
.
Deficiency of these vitamins and minerals
may result in anaemia, thus affecting RDW
levels.
In conclusion, the findings of the present
study suggest that RDW may be a novel
potential marker in determining the active
period of Behc
¸ et's disease. The cause of
increased RDW values in Behc
¸ et's disease is
unclear. Further studies are required to
understand the importance of an increased
RDW in Behc
¸ et's disease and to clarify the
mechanisms involved.
