Summary: We analyze a survey designed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of 1,298 Filipino health profes­ sionals towards breast-feeding. Some of the issues ex­ amined are the benefits of breast-feeding, the psycho­ physiology of lactation, contraindications to breast-

feeding, and the effects of drugs and contraceptives on lactation. We found a fairly low level of knowledge about breast-feeding, particularly of health contraindications. Key Words: Breast-feeding-Health professionals' knowledge-Health professionals' attitude.





  The modern health sector has been criticized for contributing to large variations in the incidence and duration of breast-feeding. Hospital and clinic prac­ tices, health professionals' lack of knowledge of in­ fants' nutritional needs, the transmittal to mothers of negative attitudes towards breast-feeding, pa­ tients' use of health professionals as role models, and the influence of the infant food industry on per­ sonnel and practices have all been cited as having potentially negative effects on the practice of breast-feeding (1-3). We present results from a 1981 Philippine survey of health professionals which was designed to evaluate some of these is­ sues.

DESCRIPTION OF THE REGION AND THE DATA
The Bicol Region
  The 1981 survey was conducted in 518 traditional and modern facilities, constituting a virtually com­

domly selected communities in the Bicol region of the Philippines. The Bicol region, about the size of New Jersey, consists of four mainland and two is­ land provinces lying approximately 300 km south­ east of Manila. The 1980 population was approxi­ mately 3.47 million, 83% of it rural. The World Bank classified 55 .4% of the families as poor in 1975, making the region the third poorest among the 12 Philippine regions. Although few people attend school beyond the sixth grade, about 90% of the population is able to read. The Bicol region is fairly representative of low-income countries in terms of its dependence on agriculture, the low quality and inadequacy of existing infrastructure, the unhealth­ fulness of environmental conditions, and the ex­ treme poverty of many households. It has a relatively large and widely dispersed system of gov­ ernment and private medical facilities existing side-by-side with a vigorous traditional health sector (4a).
   A 1978 household survey in the same commu­ nities (barangays)1 found 589 pregnant or recently

1 The country is administratively organized into 12 regions which contain provinces and independent cities. Provinces are divided into municipalities, which are subdivided into barangays containing one to two thousand people each. Barangays that are administrative centers of municipalities are called poblacions. Chartered cities are also divided into barangays. There are a total of about forty thousand barangays in the Philippines.

delivered women residing in the 1,903 survey households (4b). Of these women, about 55% had made at least one prenatal visit to a modem facility, with an average of two visits. Of the 482 women who had delivered a baby within a year previous to the survey, 92% had delivered at home. About 29% of these births had been with a modem attendant (usually trained midwives), and the rest had been with a traditional midwife. About 41% of the new­ borns had well-baby follow-up visits, but only 5% received any immunizations. Even though the ma­ jority of the women had traditional home births, 65% of them came in contact with the modern med­ ical establishment at some point during or after their pregnancies. This pattern of health service use by mothers is typical of that in other low-income coun­ tries (4).
  The 1978 survey also contained questions about breast-feeding. In 616 households with children under age 2, 92% had been breast-fed, but 62% had also been fed some kind of breast milk substitute (such as formula, sweetened condensed milk, or evaporated milk) in the first 12 months. The mean age of ending breast-feeding altogether was about 10 months, and lugaw (rice porridge), the traditional Filipino weaning food, was introduced on the av­ erage at about 6 months.

The Survey Instrument
  Burgess (5) developed the original version of the survey instrument in 1975 and used it to survey a sample of professionals in Manila. A revised ver­ sion of that survey, coauthored by Burgess, Popkin, and the Nutrition Center of the Philippines, was included in a general knowledge test given in 1978 to about 400 health professionals in the Bicol re­ gion. The breast-feeding portion of the 1978 survey was administered to our sample in 1981 after being revised to eliminate ambiguous questions and in­ consistent responses evident from analysis of the 1978 data .
  All of the modern health professionals surveyed in 1981 spoke English and completed a self-admin­ istered English version of the questionnaire under the supervision of a field investigator. Using the appropriate dia lect, investigators administered the questionnaire orally to traditional midwives. Field investigators made every attempt to get complete questionnaires from respondents, even to the extent of returning when necessary to verify ambiguous answers or failures to respond. For the questions

included in this analysis, refusals to respond be­ cause of an ambiguous question do not exceed 1% of the sample.

Sample Characteristics
  The 1981 survey counted a total of 317 physi­ cians, 489 nurses, 682 midwives, 74 barangay health aides, and 1,255 hilots (traditional midwives) serving the sample ba rangays. The sample sizes at the bottom of Table 1 indicate that we tested 60% of the physicians, 57% of the nurses, 67% of the trained midwives, 64% of the barangay health aides, and 26% of the hilots. These samples are extraor­ dinarily large relative to the populations, which guarantees a high degree of accuracy for statistical inferences.
  Except for physicians and hilots, all categories of health professionals are almost 100% female. The data on schooling show that 96% of the traditional midwives had no more than an elementary educa­ tion, although 67% of them had completed a 10-day, 40-h hilot training course taught by midwives and nurses from government health clinics. Almost all modern midwives and barangay health aides fin­ ished a 2-year midwifery course, which requires a secondary school diploma. Other information col­ lected in Table 1 shows distinct differences among professionals in age, experience, location of work, and frequency of contacts with pregnant women.

General Attitudes Towards Breast-Feeding
  Responses collected in Table 2 document a strong interest in discussing infant-feeding practices with mothe rs and in recommending breast-feeding. Nearly all of the sample thought breast-feeding was an important practice in general, and 60% of the sample was either pleased or indifferent about seeing a friend breast-feed in public. Two-thirds to three-quarters of the responde nt s would recom­ mend breast-feeding to an undecided mother without informing her about alternatives.
Three-fourths  of the sample  thought  a working
mother wanting to breast-feed should supplement with a bottle when away from the baby. This re­ sponse may indicate shallow support for breast­ feeding or may be realistic in low-income areas where expressed breast milk cannot be refrigerated. In the following sections we show that health professionals' answers to queries about specific practices may give rise to situations in which these

generally positive attitudes towards breast-feeding can be qualified or preempted by other consider­ ations.

ISSUES CONNECTING HEALTH PROFESSIONALS' BEHAVIOR AND MOTHERS'
BREAST-FEEDING PRACTICES
Knowledge of Benefits of Breast-Feeding
  Significant immunological, bonding, and contra­ ceptive effects of breast-feeding have been sug­ gested in the literature (1,6- 9). Knowledge of the physiological benefits of the practice is essential for health professionals interested in convincing mothers to breast-feed. Two earlier studies found a low level of knowledge of these benefits among health workers (5,10).
  The Bicol survey contained two types of ques­ tions about the benefits of breast-feeding. First, re­ spondents were to choose among thre_e known physical benefits to the mother. The preferred re­ sponse to the first question in Table 3 is therefore

''all of the above,'' which was chosen by a plurality of the sample. Examination of the other responses suggests a fairly high level of awareness of these benefits among modern health professionals, partic­ ularly of breast-feeding's effect in prolonging post­ partum amenorrhea. However, almost a quarter of the traditional midwives thought none of the choices could be classified as a benefit.
Second, a series of tru e/false questions were
asked about specific issue s. Only the "true" re­ sponses are tabulated in Table 3. Almost everyone felt that breast-fed babies were healthier than bottle-fed babies, while all but 15% responded af­ firmatively to a related question about gastrointes­ tinal infections.
  The question on colostrum required both an un­ derstanding of the term and an opinion about the value of colostral secretions. On this question there is a clear distinction between traditional and modern practitioners. Nearly half the traditional midwives believed colostrum provides no benefits; only about 10% of the rest of the sample shared this belief.

  Over half of the midwives and two-thirds of the health aides agreed with the proposition that for­ mula "cleanly prepared and given in sufficient quantities is as good in every way as breast milk." Doctors and nurses were much less likely to equate

formula to breast milk even under the ideal condi­ tions implied by the question.
  These figures suggest that rural women who are exposed mainly to midwives and health aides are likely to encounter professionals who, despite an

almost unanimous belief that breast-fed babies are healthier than bottle-fed ones, are still willing to equate formula to breas t milk . The apparent inc on­ sistency of these responses may be caused by a belief that formula's inferiority to breas t milk as an infant food is caused primarily by faulty prepara­ tion. Urb an women, who tend to be exposed to more highl y trained personnel, are likely to get ad­ vice more consistently in favor of breast-feeding. These are interesting findings in that urban women are commonly found to breast-feed less than rural women (2).

Knowledge of the Psychophysiology of Lactation
  Lactation is controlled primarily by the pituitary hormone s, prolactin and oxytocin (11,12). Prolactin secretion, which main tains milk produc tion, ap­ pears to be related to the amount of suck ling stim­ ulus on an approximate supply- and-demand basis. A decline in infant suckling vigor cau sed by bottle­ feedings and feeding semisolid foods ther eby causes the moth er to secrete le ss milk (1). The let-do wn



reflex, which makes milk available to the terminal lacteal s, can be inhibited by stress.
  A health professional able to explain the let-down reflex, the importance of suckling to breast milk production, and methods to overcome inverted nip­ ples will, especially  for a first-time  mother,  provide a valuable store of information that will  help  her brea st-fee d succe ss fully. See Table 4 for health professionals ' know l e dge of the se factors. Re­ sponse s to the first four question s indicate a high level of knowledge and  positive  attitudes  about these points by most of the sample .
  When asked about engorged breasts, respondents chose from the following respon ses: tra dition al treatm e nt ,2 stop bre ast -feeding for a few da ys ,

   2 Traditional trea tment co ns is ts of orasyon (magical incanta­ tions and praye rs), bu gaho n (application of a comb ination of betel nut s, betel lea ves, chewing tobacco, and a  pinch of lim e  on the engorged breast s), pressing a heated coconut shell on the engorged breasts, washin g with warm water, or applying heated lemon juice mixed with ground herbs/le aves on the engorged breasts like a poultice. This response was made by 4% of the traditional midwives.

empty breasts frequently, or take a lactation-sup­ pressing drug. The answer most consistent with continued breast-feeding is to empty the breasts. While 61% of the total sample chose this response, over 50% of the traditional midwives, 40% of the barangay health aides, and about a quarter of the modern midwives would counsel the mother to stop breast-feeding for a few days, which would almost always be inappropriate advice.
  The two questions in Table 5 focus on lactation­ related problems that health professionals probably encounter on a regular basis. The first question read, "For a baby to get plenty of breast milk, which two of the following factors do you think are the most important?" The only blatantly incorrect response (because it is inconsistent with the phrasing of the question) is that the baby be sup­ plemented with a bottle between feedings, and al­ most no one chose it. The most commonly chosen factor was the mother's diet. Modern health profes­ sionals thought that the mother's emotional state was second in order of importance, but traditional midwives tended to think that fluid intake was more significant. Frequent suckling, currently being sug­ gested in the literature as the most important factor, was chosen on the aver age by only 6% of the sample, more often by physicians and barangay health aides.
The second question in Table 5 gives health


professionals' choices of how to determine milk in­ sufficiency. This is admittedly a difficult question to answer, partly because insufficiency probably cannot be ascertained in one observation and partly because it is a difficult phenomenon to measure at all. The best answer may be to observe the growth of the infant, which would require frequent well­ baby visits and a knowledge of average weight gains for breast-fed babies. A second approach would be to assume that breast milk is adequate unless the mother is sick, has a disability, or is severely un­ dernourished, and to take the mother's claim of in­ adequate breast milk production as a plea for en­ couragement.
  The first three choices appearing in Table 5 for the insufficient milk question are the only answers contained in the questionnaire; the last three were written in by some respondents. Keeping in mind the limited range of possible responses, around three-fourths of the modern practitioners in the sample would observe the baby after a feeding, but less than half the traditional midwives would do so. Traditional midwives would be almost as likely to observe the breast for leakage. None of the sug­ gested methods has a high probability of supplying a correct diagnosis; the health professional's con­ duct in this type of situation probably depends on personal commitment to breast-feeding.
The insufficient milk syndrome has been reported

to be a common explanation by mothers for ces­ sation of breast-feeding (3). Gussler and Briese­ meister (13) hypothesize that modern infant-feeding techniques (scheduled, widely spaced feedings) are incompatible with human milk composition, human breast physiology, and infant nutritional needs, and lead to actual or perceived milk insufficiency. Health workers may contribute to the insufficient milk problem by giving inappropriate advice (e.g., early introduction of supplementary feedings) or by teaching faulty breast-feeding techniques (14,15). This issue requires additional research to pinpoint

health professionals' role in helping mothers over­ come these problems.

Problems and Contraindications to Breast-Feeding
  Conditions that may contraindicate breast­ feeding include severe illness of the mother, such as congestive heart failure, eclampsia, typhoid, or puerperal mania (1). Among low-income popula­ tions, the health risks of breast-feeding when the mother has a communicable disease such as leprosy



or tuberculosis are probably fewer than the risks of not breast-feeding the infant. Temporary cessation of breast-feeding may be necessary while certain drugs are being used, to prevent bilirubin toxicity, or in cases where the newborn has poor sucking vigor (16,17). The most common maternal problems of breast-feeding, cracked or inverted nipples, can often be prevented if health workers teach mothers appropriate prenatal preparation of the breasts and proper breast-feeding techniques (18-20).
  Table 6 contains a list of conditions, none of which are classified for low-income countries as contraindications to breast-feeding. However, be­ tween 50 and 94% of the health professionals would advise against breast-feeding for women with the listed conditions.
  Such beliefs can have serious consequences. For example, while rehydration of diarrheal babies is a goal of the primary health care movement, over three-quarters of the primary health workers in the sample would counsel against breast-feeding for a baby suffering from diarrhea. Breast-feeding alone may not be adequate to rehydrate an infant who needs supplemental water and electrolytes, but diarrhea in infants is such a common occurrence in low-income countries that advising against breast­ feeding while a baby has diarrhea would at the very least make the maintenance of lactation difficult.
  The last response category in Table 6 could be a contraindication to breast-feeding if cosmetic con­ siderations are important. Except for barangay

health aides, public doctors, and nurses, over half of each type of practitioner felt breast-feeding causes breasts to lose their shape. Traditional mid­ wives were most likely to subscribe to this belief. Little in the way of actual research exists on this issue , although Oski (21) found breast-feeding was associated more often with a return of breasts to their normal shape. Common sense suggests that even if breast-feeding were to have a deleterious effect on breast shape, factors such as heredity , age, physical condition , and nutrition would operate at least as strongly. No matter what the truth is, the responses imply that in a situation where breast shape is important to the mother, her desire not to breast-feed for that reason would be reinforced by the beliefs of a majority of the health professionals in the sample.

Initiation of Breast-Feeding, Mother-Infant
Contact, and Rooming-In
  Some researchers hypothesize that there is a pe­ riod immediately after birth when reciprocal inter­ actions occur between mother and infant which are critical to the formation of a strong long-term emo­ tional attachment (8,22-25) and to the  incidence and duration of breast-feeding (3,23-27). In addi­ tion, immediate suckling can help contract the uterus, expel the placenta, and stop maternal bleeding.
One-third of the Bicolano health professionals felt

infants should be separated from their mothers after delivery (Table 7). Approximately a third of the public and private midwives and nearly two-thirds of the traditional midwives, most of whom attend home deliveries , would separate mother and infant. The data in Table 7 also show the mean number of hours after birth each type of practitioner would wait before putting the newborn to the mother ' s breast. On the average, traditional midwives would wait the longest and health aides the shortest-a difference of 7.5 h. Nevertheless, even the aides' 14 his a long time if the preference is for immediate suckling. Referring to the frequencies for this vari­ able (not tabulated here), only about 21% of the sample would put the baby to the breast within 6 h
of birth.

Demand Feeding
  Human milk, like that of other primates, has pro­ tein and fat concentration characteristics of contin­ uous feeders (28). The slow rate of human sucking


further supports the hypothesis that infants need continuous mother contact to facilitate feeding (8). Demand feeding in hospitals has been found to in­ crease the incidence of breast-feeding at discharge and its duration thereafter (29). An average ofthree­ quarters of the respondents felt establishing a feeding routine early in life by scheduling specific breast-feeding times is important. Public physicians were least supportive of this proposition, but the sample as a whole was clearly opposed to demand feeding (Table 7).

Duration of Breast-Feeding
  In high-income countries, exclusive breast­ feeding may not be recommended for as long a time as it is in low-income areas; nevertheless, all neo­ nates can benefit from exclusive breast-feeding for 3 to 6 months. Bafna , Parekh, and Kaul (30) found qualified medical school graduates in India recom­ mended breast-feeding for 6 to 24 months, with younger doctors recommending shorter durations.

Burgess (5) calculated a mean recommendation of 12 months duration for her sample from Manila. The averages reported in Table 7 show general agreement that babies should be weaned at about 10 months.

Supplementary Feeding
  Lactation experts consider the practice of prelac­ teal and complementary feeds to the breast-fed ne­ onate detrimental to successful breast-feeding (1,31). More than three-fourths of the Bicol respon­ dents, however, believed bottle feedings should be given until the mother's breast milk comes in (Table 7). Traditional midwives were most supportive of this idea.
  Supplementing breast-feedings with other milks, formulas, or foods is necessary when the infant's nutritional needs exceed its breast milk intake. Ex­ clusively breast-fed infants of well-nourished U.S. mothers have been noted to be healthy and growing through 6 to 8 months of age (32), while some 3- month old, exclusively breast-fed infants in low-in­ come countries have been found malnourished (33- 35). Although there is no consensus on the proper age for supplementation, most agree it should begin some time between 4 and 6 months of age (28), but not before 3 months or before the child weighs at least 6 to 7 kg (36).
  Supplementation may be associated with a de­ cline in breast-feeding (37). Whether this is a bio­ logical or a behavioral phenomenon is not fully un­ derstood (2). Introduction of supplemental foods both too early and too late in infancy can potentially lead to nutritional and health problems.
  About half the modern health professionals in the Bicol survey recommended supplementation with solids at or before 3 months of age, while only 8% of traditional midwives recommended this early and inappropriate supplementation. The averages for

this variable (Table 7) indicate a fair amount of agreement by modern health professionals that non­ milk supplementation should begin at around 4 months. The average response for traditional mid­ wives, however, was closer to 7 months.

SUMMARY STATISTICS
  In this section we distill from the raw data cited above summary statistics measuring the knowledge and attitudes of the health professionals.

Knowledge
  We treated a subset of the questions in the survey as a test of knowledge about breast-feeding, awarding points for correct answers. In determining the best answers, we evaluated the responses from the point of view of someone testing for a good breast-feeding promoter in the context of a low­ income country. The actual scoring is available from the authors, but one example of our judgment in scoring the test follows. For the question on treating engorged breasts, a point was given only for the response that breasts should be emptied fre­ quently. Advice to take a lactation-suppressing drug was correct in that it would relieve the engorge­ ment, but taking the drug would also inhibit breast­ feeding performance.
  According to our scoring method, the sample did poorly (see Table 8). The lowest and highest indi­ vidual scores were 23% and 88%, respectively. Tra­ ditional midwives had the lowest group score, with an average of 48%. Government physicians had the highest group score, 63%. The low level of general knowledge must be weighed against the good per­ formance of the sample on specific questions, as all questions are not , in practice, equally important. However, because professionals are repeatedly called on to advise lactating mothers about all kinds

of problems, the low summary scores should not be disregarded.

Attitudes
  Scores were relatively high on the attitudinal questions, with a mean score for the sample of 78%. Once again, however, traditional midwives had the lowest group score, 72%. Except for private nurses and midwives, all modern health professionals achieved scores at or above 80% (Table 8).

CONCLUSION
  A large majority of pregnant women in the Bicol region are delivered by traditional midwives. Nev­ ertheless, they are likely to come in contact  with the modern medical sector at some point during their pregnancies or immediately postpartum (38).
  These women probably encounter strong positive attitudes towards breast-feeding that are frequently qualified by, or difficult to put into practice because of, inadequate knowledge of human lactation. In particular, many health professionals appear to hold erroneous beliefs about contraindications to breast­ feeding and would probably recommend inordi­ nately early supplementation of the infant.
  Often the traditional midwife has been assumed to be the most supportive among health workers of breast-feeding. This survey has repeatedly shown, however, that traditional midwives as a group are the least knowledgeable about breast-feeding and have the most negative attitudes towards the prac­ tice even though they are well informed on a few items (importance of suckling, and a later, more ap­ propriate weaning age). It is conceivable, therefore, that a decline in breast-feeding may be as much related to contact with traditional practitioners as with modern ones. The strong relationship scien­ tists have found between the use of modern medical practitioners and reduced breast-feeding may be as­ sociated more with socioeconomic factors which af­ fect maternal behavior than with the modern med­ ical establishment per se.
  The results indicate there is room (in the Bicol region and, if the results can be extrapolated, in many other similar regions of the world) for im­ proving health practitioners' knowledge about lac­ tation. Attitudes, however, are generally positive towards breast-feeding and probably cause few problems. Efforts to improve health professionals' knowledge (particularly the knowledge of tradi­ tional practitioners) appear to contain some poten-

tial for improving the skills of those professionals who advise new mothers and for allowing health professionals to act in ways consistent with their positive attitudes.
  This study has been conceptual in orientation and the data represent a first attempt at evaluation. This effort provides a starting point for instructing and testing health professionals on breast-feeding and for trying to measure knowledge and attitudes. The data are cross-sectional, but it would be equally useful to look at changes in health professionals' knowledge and attitudes over time in response to training programs and increased awareness of the issue.
  We have used these data in two other studies. In one analysis, we tested the effects of contacts be­ tween the medical sector and infant formula com­ panies on knowledge and attitude formation among health professionals (38). In a second paper, we linked health professionals' knowledge, attitudes, and formula sample distribution practices to mothers' infant-feeding decisions (39).
