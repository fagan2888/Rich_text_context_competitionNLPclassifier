College athletics is often the first insight or topic that is dis-
cussed nationally among the U.S. public in reference to insti-
tutions of higher learning. When a university's athletics
program is successful at an elite level, the media exposure can
cast a wide spotlight and positive perception on that institu-
tion (Goff, 2000). This begs the following question: When a
Division Institution experiences a year(s) of "athletics suc-
cess," how does that athletics success impact an institution in
terms of private contributions? For this study, athletics suc-
cess included Division I (DI) institutions that competed in a
football Bowl Championship Series (BCS) Football Game or
National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Men's
Basketball Final Four. This operational definition of success
was conservative in nature to include a broad range of defini-
tions for athletics success. This definition is even sometimes
considered to be "elite athletics success." Fifty-two DI uni-
versities and 129 total samples were studied over a period of
10 years (2002-2011) to determine whether athletics success
had a significant impact on overall private contributions to
the university. Private contributions included donations to the
entire university, including academic and athletic areas, and
also restricted and unrestricted giving to the institution.
Universities in particular depend upon a large majority of
their resources from external forces such as private contribu-
tions from individuals, corporations, and foundations (Lee &
Clery, 2012). These external entities have power over the
organization to determine whether it receives the resources
and how the resources should be spent (Froosman, 1999).
Because these funds are not required, but voluntary, the out-
side agencies have influence with their contributions.
Therefore it is essential to understand and analyze relation-
ships that exist in donors' motivations for their private con-
tributions, which may include athletics success or other
variables (Wunnava & Okunade, 2013). Relationships with
external entities therefore are critical to maintain and enhance
those resources (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). Intercollegiate
athletics have played a central role in higher education and

Division I Intercollegiate Athletics Success
and the Financial Impact on Universities
Adam G. Walker1
Abstract
Private monetary contributions and the role of athletics are topics of discussion at nearly all institutions, and thus any
relationship between the two has become increasingly valuable to determine donor motivations. This quantitative research
study analyzed universities' overall private contributions to determine whether there was a significant difference in the
percentage of overall financial support to the institutions following a year of athletics success. For this study, athletics success
included participation in either the Division I (DI) men's basketball National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Final
Four or DI Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) Bowl Championship Series (BCS) Bowl Game. The study focused on a period
of 10 years (2002-2011) using a sample of 129 observations (Council for Aid to Education's [CAE] Voluntary Support of
Education [VSE] Survey)--satisfying the criteria above, then comparing them with the baseline (all institutions) during the
same period of time to determine whether the change in the percentage of overall contribution was statistically significant
over a 2-year period. The results show a significant statistical difference of more than double in the percent increase of overall
private contributions for institutions with athletics success compared with all higher education institutions. Furthermore,
a small statistical difference was found for the athletics success in private institutions compared with public institutions
that experienced similar athletics success. No difference was found by region, for history of athletics success, or between
basketball or football athletics success for those institutions experiencing athletics success. The study concluded that there
are significant implications for overall private financial support for institutions that experience athletics success, especially
those with a private affiliation.

those relationships for many years by galvanizing alumni,
friends, community, and the campus culture.
The topics of enhanced admissions standards and private
philanthropy are increasingly being emphasized on cam-
puses nationwide. Alumni giving, in the form of private
donations, are increasingly important in the current eco-
nomic climate challenging higher education. In fiscal year
2012, donors contributed more than US$31 billion to the
nation's colleges and universities (Council for Aid to
Education [CAE], 2013). Forty-four percent of contributions
were directed from individuals, while 30% were generated
from foundations and 17% from corporations (CAE, 2013).
Theoretical Framework
The theoretical framework that follows ties together the
thought that the perception, image, or identity a potential
donor holds or university portrays may be influential on the
decision of donors to contribute or increase their monetary
support. Each of the theories below are closely associated
with athletics, in that often times, athletics receives the most
exposure at an institution and is used as a conduit for the
university's image. A successful athletics program may con-
vey a positive image overall of the university and make a
donor more inclined to give to that institution in regard to the
enhanced exposure and feelings of pride or achievement for
an institution they associate with personally.
Because athletics have an impact on the external environ-
ment and perception of the institution, these theories align
with the premise of this study. Understanding how these theo-
ries are woven into the fabric between athletics and the uni-
versity can be beneficial to administrators to take advantage
of situations where athletics success can enhance the image,
perception, identity, or external environments in their favor.
Resource Dependence Theory
Resource dependence theory developed by Pfeffer and
Salancik (1978) operates on the concept that organizations
depend on their environments for resources, both internally
and externally. Universities in particular depend upon a large
majority of their resources from external forces including
key stakeholders and donors to the institution. These external
entities have power over the organization to determine
whether it receives the resources and how those resources
should be spent (Froosman, 1999). Depending on the needs
and scarcity, the university can be highly dependent upon the
supplier of those funds (Casciaro & Piskorski, 2005).
Resource dependence theory states that institutions are
dependent on external entities to survive (Bess & Dee, 2012).
External constituents not only determine whether or not an
organization will receive resources but they also determine the
extent to which the organization uses the resources. These con-
stituents may be influenced by the outward perception of the
institution for their donor motivations, which may be influenced
by athletics success. Resource dependence theory implies that
there is a power relationship. In addition to adapting to the envi-
ronment, organizations must maintain strong external relation-
ships with constituents to attain resources for stability.
Systems Theory
Systems theory originates from early research by Bertalanffy
(1968) and Berrien (1968). Systems theory in organiza-
tional environments asserts that institutions have an inter-
dependent relationship with the external environment
(Bess & Dee, 2012). Ongoing transactions occur on a con-
tinuous basis between the organization and the environ-
ment. Key characteristics of the environment sustain the
organization.
This theory relates how athletics has a direct and indi-
rect impact on the institution. These direct and indirect
impacts range from perception to financial. Athletics
gains much public attention, and public opinion can be
cast on the entire institution based on positive and nega-
tive associations. Athletic scandals, criminal arrests, or
poor academic results can have a negative perception,
while conversely, athletics success, community service
and involvement, and academic success and graduation in
athletics can lead to positive perceptions. Under this the-
ory, reciprocal relationship exists between the organiza-
tion and the environment. Such a relationship could occur
in regard to athletics success and the external environ-
ment, the community where the university resides in being
a primary example. This relationship could be positive,
neutral, or negative.
Institutional Theory
Institutional theory addresses the significance of under-
standing external expectations for institutions (Bess &
Dee, 2012). According to DiMaggio and Powell (1983),
colleges and universities gain legitimacy through coer-
cive, mimetic, and normative conformity. Choices made
by the institution are limited by external pressures from
the environment. Institutional theory explains that institu-
tions reflect the attitudes, values, and beliefs of the exter-
nal environment in which the institution is embedded
(Bess & Dee, 2012). Such might be the case with the sur-
rounding community in which an institution is located,
depending upon the community's actions and values may
determine to the extent in which the athletics program is
embraced or neglected. This is often the case in communi-
ties that place a heightened emphasis or expectations on
institutions in regard to athletics success. One example is
in the Southeastern Conference (SEC), where the fan
bases can be obsessive and place great personal and emo-
tional investments on the performance of their athletic
programs.

Literature Review
Relationships Between Athletics Success and the
Direct Impact on Universities
The basis of a positive relationship between donor giving and
athletics team success is to an extent a psychological perspec-
tive. James Strode (2006), in his research on this topic, noted
that the relationship begins with the concept of achievement.
Athletics donors earmark their gifts to athletics because of
a special affinity or because of the incentives and benefits of
giving to athletics (Howard & Stinson, 2008). Some have ana-
lyzed whether giving to athletics has produced a crowding-out
effect, hurting overall academic giving. For instance, Howard
and Stinson (2008) found that a shift toward greater athletics
giving was present at schools with major football programs.
The researchers deduced that schools did experience giving
increases around athletics team success. Their research
shows that the crowding-out effect does not occur, on aver-
age, at these institutions but that both parties (athletics and
academic) benefit from success (Howard & Stinson,
2008).
The definition of success is different to each individual,
although Humphreys and Mondello (2005) closely studied
the effects of post-season football bowl games and NCAA DI
men's basketball tournament appearances. They define suc-
cess as partaking in post-season play. Again football and bas-
ketball, the most visible sports, generate the most interest and
contributions from donors. These are also the sports which
receive the most media exposure nationwide. For this study,
the definition was even more conservative and included only
universities reaching the DI men's Final Four or a football
BCS Bowl Game.
Most importantly, Humphreys and Mondello (2005)
found that restricted giving (giving specifically earmarked
for athletics) did increase with appearances by schools in
post-season play, although unrestricted giving did not
increase. Unrestricted giving typically responds to variations
in economic conditions, and athletics success does not prove
to induce donors to increase this unrestricted giving.
In 2007, Humphreys and Mondello reviewed a compre-
hensive data set for 320 colleges and universities drawn from
the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System for the
period 1976 to 1996, a previously untapped source for dona-
tion studies. Their data included giving by alumni, founda-
tions, corporations, and other sources. They studied both
restricted and unrestricted donations in the study. They found
no increase in unrestricted donations as a result of any mea-
sure of success of either football or men's basketball pro-
grams. Restricted giving appeared to rise at both public and
private universities in response to success of the basketball
team, and at public institutions when the football team is
invited to a bowl game.
Howard and Stinson (2007) found similar findings that
less prestigious academic institutions are influenced more by
athletics success and have a larger portion of total institu-
tional gifts allocated in support of intercollegiate athletics
programs. According to Litan, Orszag, and Orszag (2003),
there is no relationship between spending more on athletics
and winning more. Second, increased spending on coaches'
salaries has no significant relationship to success or increased
revenue, according to a follow-up study.
These studies would be another factor to examine each
institution on a case-by-case basis to determine why this is
so. One could hypothesize back to the culture and environ-
ment discussed in the "Theoretical Framework" section that
relates to giving; stated that the mission, image, identity, and
expectations of the institution affect perceptions and, there-
fore, emphasis placed on athletics success and giving. Simply
stated, each institution's perception and relationship with
athletics is shaped by their own identity and community or
environment in which each institition is located.
Meer and Rosen (2008) found when a male graduate's
former team wins its conference championship, his dona-
tions for general purposes increased by about 7% and his
donations to the athletics program increased by about the
same percentage. This study indicates another perspective
that overall athletics success drives overall private contribu-
tions to an institution. Rhoads and Gerking (2000) also found
a positive relationship by examining bowl appearances in
football and NCAA tournament appearances in basketball,
which resulted in an increase in overall alumni contributions
to the institution.
Ethical Issues and Litigation in College Athletics
Large ethical concerns persist within college athletics. Walter
Byers, who served as NCAA executive director from 1951 to
1987, was charged with the dual mission of keeping intercol-
legiate athletics clean while generating millions of dollars
each year for the colleges. Byers believes that modern-day
college sports are no longer a student activity or amateur
sport, but they are a high-dollar commercial enterprise, and
college athletes should have the same access to the free mar-
ket as their coaches and colleges (Byers, 1995).
College athletics is now beginning to see this proliferation
with recent litigation involving student-athlete's names,
images, or likeness (O'Bannon vs. NCAA, 2014) and stu-
dent-athlete compensation in regard to EA Sports video
games (Keller vs. NCAA, 2014). With these recent rulings,
student-athletes may be compensated for use of their names,
images, or likeness. While the Keller case was settled out of
court, the O'Bannon case entitles student-athletes to be com-
pensated via a trust with a cap no less than US$5,000 per
year, depending on academic eligibility (O'Bannon vs.
NCAA, 2014). This opens up a new dynamic whereby stu-
dent-athletes are now sharing a portion of revenues. These
recent rulings appeal to earlier research suggesting the expo-
sure and exploitation of amateur student-athletes (Sack &
Staurowsky, 1998; Zimbalist, 2001).

Indirect Benefits of Athletics Success
In addition to individual benefits, there may also be indirect
effects to public institutions in terms of state appropriations.
Using data on 570 public universities, Humphreys (2006)
found that those fielding DI Football Bowl Subdivision
(FBS) football teams receive about 8% more from their state
legislature than otherwise comparable universities that do
not participate in DI (FBS) football. Participation seems to
be what matters. Success is less important. State subsidies
appear to be no greater for universities with top 20 or bowl-
participating football teams.
Bowen and Shulman (2001) found that among a top
donor group, the top 5% of donors to universities do not, on
the whole, care about athletics and instead cite more interest
in supporting undergraduate education, intellectual free-
dom, and extracurricular activities. Donors of today are
looking to support broad participation, affecting the largest
number of lives possible. Most donors often identify with
the many students who are leading lives similar to the ones
they led while in school, which is more than likely not as
one of a few star athletes. Ultimately, donors want their
schools to place less, not more, emphasis on collegiate ath-
letics (Bowen & Shulman, 2001). Although this research
shows evidence of no relationship between success and giv-
ing, the pervading outcome of research on this topic reveals
a positive relationship between the two.
The most notable university admissions case as it
relates to athletics success originates from Boston College
University and the "Flutie Factor" that resulted from Doug
Flutie's on-field heroics in 1984 (Fleming, 2007). In this
case, Boston College experienced an unprecedented 30%
application increase in the 2 years following the legendary
Hail Mary pass (Fleming, 2007).
Since this case, there are a number of other similar situa-
tions where universities have experienced a spike in applica-
tions and have increased their enrollment due to athletics
success. McEvoy (2006), in an article written for the United
States Sports Academy, shows empirical support for admis-
sions applications increases and provides a number of addi-
tional case studies and previous research on the topic, all
contributing further to this fact. Athletics serve as a market-
ing tool and rallying point for the institution, leading to
recruiting more students, not just student-athletes (McEvoy,
2006). In addition, and equally as important to higher educa-
tion, empirical evidence finds that athletics prominence and
success were related to increased out-of-state enrollment
(McEvoy, 2006).
Recently, Butler University after their consecutive runs to
the men's Final Four experienced an increase of 41% in
applications, athletics donations increased by 200% (US$1
million to US$3 million over 2 years), and alumni giving
increased 10% in 1 year (DiConsiglio, 2012). Some reports
also estimate the public exposure Butler received was esti-
mated at US$500 million in publicity (DiConsiglio, 2012).
Gonzaga, Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), Texas
Christian University (TCU), and Boise State have all seen
similar results in applications and donations (DiConsiglio,
2012).
Toma and Cross (1998) also found athletics success
relates to an increase in applications. They compared the 30
institutions that won national championships in football and
men's basketball between 1979 and 1992 with a set of peer
institutions to see if an increase in admissions applications
occurred after athletics success. The researchers found that
under most circumstances notable increases resulted in
admissions applications received, both in the year of, and
over the 3 years following the championship season (Toma
& Cross, 1998). Sandy and Sloane (2004) found that institu-
tions with DI athletics programs attract more applications
and enroll students with higher average SAT scores than
similar institutions that do not participate in DI sports.
McCormick and Tinsley (1987) discovered the same results
when they examined 63 universities, each in one of the six
"big-time" athletics conferences, compared with other col-
leges and universities.
Fleming (2007), in a report on Jaren and Devin Pope's
research around sports success and admissions, declares the
empirical evidence among the top 20 football schools and
top 16 basketball schools, has an increase of between 2% and
8% in admissions. Fleming noted that Pope found an
increased pool of applicants across the schools with both
high and low SAT scores. While the amount of applicants
may increase, critics say that the yield decreases. However,
Pope and Pope (2009) argue that the greater amount of appli-
cations simply allows the institution to be more selective and
improve their incoming freshmen class. Tucker (2005) also
found significance in the relation to football success and
enhanced incoming freshmen's SAT scores from studying
years 1990 through 2002.
The most influential piece of Pope and Pope's (2009)
research is that it was conducted over a 19-year span, elimi-
nating the chance for critics to claim that the increase in
admissions was not sustainable. This time period allows the
studies to show the increase as well as the stability that fol-
lowed (Pope & Pope, 2009). In an interview with George
Mason University's press secretary, it was revealed that the
school had a number of positive outcomes from their Final
Four appearance in 2006. On top of admissions increasing,
the general visibility and awareness of the institution created
a genuine sense of pride in those affiliated with the university
and produced a special curiosity from those who did not
know about the university (Pope & Pope, 2009).
Most recently, Koo and Dittmore (2014) determined that
winning football teams are related to increases in both aca-
demic and athletic donations. They ruled out the idea that
athletic donations "crowd out" academic donations (Koo &
Dittmore, 2012), finding rather that "there was a significant
and positive causal relationship between athletic factors and
academic giving." For example, the coefficient on athletic
Walker 5
giving implied that for every US$1 increase in athletic giv-
ing, the current dollars of voluntary support restricted to aca-
demic purposes will increase by 48 cents.
Based on this evidence showing a positive relationship
between university admissions and athletics team success,
institutions of higher education have a choice of how to capi-
talize on this phenomenon. McEvoy (2006), in his research,
gives a detailed listing of options for the university. First, the
university could admit more applicants of "comparable qual-
ity" resulting in increased enrollment and, thus, additional
revenue. Second, the university could increase the "rigor in
its admissions process," admitting the same number of stu-
dents as before, although with better qualifications, increas-
ing the average quality of student. Third, a hybrid approach
could be taken by only slightly increasing the applicant pool
and increasing admissions standards (McEvoy, 2006).
Regardless of the option that is chosen, the institution should
benefit.
Although athletics has been viewed as an entity that pri-
marily needs university subsidies and can contribute to the
"cost disease" at many institutions nationwide, there are ben-
efits. In select cases, programs at the highest levels generate
revenue and can help alleviate financial burdens for their
institutions. Anderson (2012) found a positive link between
athletics success and donations, applications, and enhanced
freshmen students' academic standards. His study finds that
winning reduces acceptance rates (enhancing selectivity),
and increases donations, applications, academic reputation,
in-state enrollment, and incoming SAT scores. Prior to this
study, conflicting studies existed as to whether athletics suc-
cess increases overall donations to institutions (Anderson,
2012; Bowen & Shulman, 2001; Howard & Stinson, 2007,
2008; Humphreys & Mondello, 2005; Meer & Rosen, 2008).
From his conclusions, Anderson (2012) states,
Consider a school that improves its season wins by 5 games (the
approximate difference between a 25th percentile season and a
75th percentile season). Changes of this magnitude occur
approximately 8% of the time over a 1-year period and 13% of
the time over a 2-year period. This school may expect alumni
athletics donations to increase by $682,000 (28%), applications
to increase by 677 (5%), the acceptance rate to drop by 1.5
percentage points (2%), in-state enrollment to increase by 76
students (3%), and incoming 25th percentile SAT scores to
increase by 9 points (1%). (p. 18)
Another recent case is the first of its kind; Louisiana State
University (LSU)Athletics announced in the summer of 2012
that they will begin transferring up to US$7.2 million annu-
ally to the academic side of campus from athletics revenues.
This is the first case where an athletics program has pledged
to help contribute to the overall university instead of receiv-
ing a subsidy (Addo, 2012). Other institutions support the
academic side, but it is usually on a year-to-year basis and not
pledged over a period of years. In recent years, athletic sup-
port of academic initiatives has grown at many institutions.
However, the support of academics by athletics is rare; 98 of
the 120 DI institutions in 2010 lost money on their athletics
programs; the median deficit was US$9.4 million (National
Collegiate Athletic Association [NCAA], 2010). Yet schools
remain caught up in an ever-escalating "arms race"--at the
expense of academic scholarships, facilities, and faculty
(Benedict & Keteyian, 2013). It is a case of a "go big or go
home" mentality, which can either pay off large for a small
amount of schools or leave institutions "footing the bill" for
their athletics programs.
Data and Method
The research questions addressed in this study were as follows:
Research Question 1: What financial impact does "ath-
letics success" have on a Division Institution in terms of
overall private contributions? Specifically, is there a sig-
nificant difference in the percentage of overall private
support to the institution following a year of athletics
success?
Research Question 2: What impact does regional loca-
tion, public or private affiliation, or history of athletics
success have on overall private contributions using the
same measurements?
Research Question 3: Does the difference in percent
change from private contributions differ between DI insti-
tutions with basketball athletics success compared with
DI institutions with football athletics success?
This study was a quantitative analysis of public, second-
ary data obtained through the CAE's Voluntary Support of
Education (VSE) Survey, a voluntary survey of higher edu-
cation institutions with standardized data pulled from their
annual reports. This survey was selected because it records
private support to nearly each institution of higher education
and is the most comprehensive and complete annual survey
on overall private contributions. The CAE has conducted
survey research on the private support of education since
1957 (CAE, 2013). Over the years, this research has evolved
into a large-scale annual research and dissemination pro-
gram, the VSE. The survey is open to all colleges, universi-
ties, and private elementary and secondary schools in the
United States. The Council for Advancement and Support of
Education (CASE) co-sponsors the survey. Based on these
results, CAE develops and disseminates national estimates of
giving to higher education (CAE, 2013).
The VSE Survey is designed to obtain information on the
amounts, sources, donor-specified purposes, forms of private
gifts, grants, and bequests received by educational institu-
tions. The 2013 VSE Survey collected data on funds raised
from private sources for the fiscal year beginning July 1,
2011, and ending June 30, 2012, with a few institutions
reporting on different fiscal calendars (CAE, 2013). In July
2012, CAE mailed an announcement that the survey was
6 SAGE Open
open to 2,700 four-year institutions and 1,184 two-year insti-
tutions. For this study, the category of "total support" was
identified as the main dependent variable. Total support was
defined as the total of outright giving and deferred giving,
both at present value (CAE, 2013).
In the most recent survey by the CAE (2013), 1,015 higher
education institutions had provided complete data, including
all samples studied for this research project. A baseline of
financial support in terms of difference in giving by percent
was totaled for all higher education institutions utilizing
these institutions from 2001 to 2012, a year before the 2002
athletics success and a year after the 2011 athletics success.
This baseline was used against the sample to determine
whether a statistically significant difference was found. The
population as defined by athletics success was applied for the
recent last 10 years (2002-2011), to determine whether there
was a significant difference in the percentage of contribu-
tions to the university utilizing a one-sample t-test analysis in
SPSS (19th edition). Subsequent research questions regard-
ing differences in region were analyzed using a one-way
ANOVA test; public or private affiliation, history of athletics
success, and basketball versus football success were ana-
lyzed using an independent samples t test.
All higher education institutions that participated in the
VSE Survey were included in the study, which ranged from
954 to 1,052 participants from 2001 to 2012 (CAE, 2002-
2013). The institutions, including DI athletically successful
ones, were used as a baseline for comparison with those
schools that experienced athletics success. Based on the defi-
nition for athletics success, 40 institutions participated in a
men's Final Four over the last 10 years from 2002 to 2011
(NCAA, 2013). One institution did not report data in the sur-
vey and was excluded, leaving the sample size for DI basket-
ball at 39. Also using a similar definition for athletics success
applied to DI football, 91 institutions competed in a BCS
Bowl Game over the last 10 years from 2002 to 2011 (Bowl
Championship Series, 2013). One institution did not report
data in the survey and was excluded, leaving the sample size
at 90.
Adding the DI basketball athletically successful institu-
tions (39) to the DI football athletically successful institu-
tions (90) provided a total sample size of 129 for the study.
There were 52 universities included as independent vari-
ables, as multiple schools competed in Final Four or BCS
Bowl multiple times. Each year accounted for a separate
sample totaling 129, and data were collected accordingly
over the 10-year defined period. The years collecting data
span from 2001 to 2012 compared with the period of athlet-
ics success, 2002 to 2011, to collect all previous year's data
and the year following the success, which is why 2012 athlet-
ics success is excluded (fiscal year 2013 data were not avail-
able, released in 2014 VSE Survey).
Measurements were taken the year prior to the athletics'
success, year during, and the year after, accounting for a
2-year span. These data measured the percentage of increase
or decrease of private support over the 2 years compared
with the baseline (all institutions of higher education listed in
the survey, average N = 1,003), and whether that difference
was statistically significant utilizing a one-sample t test. A
one-sample t test was administered to determine significance
at the .05 alpha level. Effect size was measured after the t test
to determine the effect size of any significant statistical dif-
ferences found. A Cohen's d test was utilized to find the
effect size of each significant result (Cohen, 1988).
The data were segmented including region, public versus
private affiliation, history of athletics success, and basketball
versus football success. A one-way ANOVA test was used to
compare the groups in terms of regions (East, North/Midwest,
South, and West). Each region was compared with the base-
line via a one-sample t test. If a region was found to be sig-
nificant, then that region(s) was (were) compared against the
other regions in an independent samples t-test comparison.
Independent samples t tests were utilized to compare the
groups in terms of public versus private affiliation, history of
athletics success, and basketball versus football success.
Study Demographics
The study included 129 observations during the last 10 years,
2002 to 2011, that had achieved athletics success. As stated,
athletics success was defined as participating in the men's DI
NCAA Final Four in basketball or a BCS Bowl Game in
football. Ninety of these institutions studied participated in a
BCS Bowl Game, while the remaining 39 participated in
men's DI NCAA Final Four. Fifteen of these institutions
were private institutions, while the remaining 114 were pub-
lic institutions. Eighty-three institutions were identified as
having a "history of athletics success." A history of athletics
success in this study was defined as a school wining two or
more national championships in that sport. Forty-six institu-
tions were identified as no "history of athletics success" for
this study. Schools were also placed into a geographical
region and analyzed. Twenty-two institutions were listed in
the "East" region of the country, 52 were listed as "North/
Midwest" region of the country, 36 were included in the
"South" region of the United States, and lastly, 19 institu-
tions were identified in the "West" region of the country
(Table 1)
Results
Research Question 1
For Research Question 1, a one-sample t test was conducted
comparing 129 DI institutions with athletics success to the
baseline, which ranged from 954 to 1,052 institutions, with
an average of 1,003 respondents for all higher education
institutions reporting during 2001 to 2012. The mean percent
change during a 2-year period for all higher education insti-
tutions was 0.0535 (5.35%) increase during the time period
Walker 7
of 2002 to 2011, which included the athletically successful
institutions as well. The athletically successful institutions
mean was 12.84% during the same time period. The results
of the one-sample t test were significant at the .05 level,
t(128) = 3.09, p = .002, d = 0.55 (Table 2); therefore, there is
a statistically significant difference between the percent
change in private contributions to institutions that experience
athletics success compared with all other institutions.
The results show a median percent change for all higher
education institutions of 5.35% over 2 years. Those institu-
tions with athletics success exhibited a median percent
change of 12.84% (Figure 1). As stated above, this difference
is statistically significant (p = .002). This indicates an aver-
age increase of more than double for an institution that expe-
riences athletics success over the baseline. The effect size or
Cohen's d for this result was 0.55. This result of .55 indicates
the two groups' means differ by more than half a standard
deviation. This difference is larger than .5, which is consid-
ered a medium effect size (Cohen, 1988). The formula used
to compute the Cohen's d effect size was d = (t × 2) / (sqrt
(df)), where, d = Cohen's d value or effect size (standardized
mean difference), t = t-test value, and df = degrees of
freedom.
Research Question 2
For the second research question, the study conducted sev-
eral tests on each of the variables. For the variable private
versus public, an independent samples t test was conducted
between private (M = 0.2821, SD = 0.34) and public (M =
0.1081, SD = 0.26) and showed marginal statistical signifi-
cance between the two groups, t(16.27) = 1.92, p = .072, d =
0.34 (Table 3). The equal variances not assumed was used
because homogeneity of variance was not met (.038 < .05) in
the Levene's Test for Equality of Variances.
Private and public DI institutions were then separately
studied in a one-sample t test versus the baseline. Private
institutions displayed a statistical significance versus the
baseline, t(14) = 2.62, p = .02, d = 1.40 (Table 4). The effect
size for private institutions that experienced athletics success
was above the threshold for an effect size considered large
(1.40 > 0.80) in a study (Cohen, 1988). Public institutions
also demonstrated statistical significance versus the baseline,
t(113) = 2.24, p = .027, d = 0.42 (Table 5). The effect size for
public institutions that experienced athletics success was
considered between the small (0.2-0.3) to medium range
(0.50) in this instance (Cohen, 1988). This could possibly
show the private institutions as a driving force as an interac-
tion effect.
Next, the study conducted an independent samples t test
between institutions with a history of athletics success, which
experienced a year of athletics success, versus institutions
with no history of athletics success, which experienced a
year of athletics success. The results concluded no statistical
significant difference between the two groups aforemen-
tioned, t(127) = 0.46, p = .648 (Table 6).
The following analysis determines whether there were
differences between geographical regions of the country that
experienced athletics success. Each institution was seg-
mented into one of four regions: East, North/Midwest, South,
or West. Twenty-two institutions were classified as East, 52
as North/Midwest, 36 as South, and 19 as West. A one-way
ANOVA test was conducted; the results showed no statistical
difference between the four groups, t(3, 125) = 0.41, p = .745
(Table 7).
After examining the difference in means between the
groups (Figure 2), a one- sample t test was conducted sepa-
rately utilizing each region versus the baseline. The results
below illustrate only the South region exhibiting a statisti-
cally significant difference from the baseline group, t(35) =
2.36, p = .024, d = 0.80 (Table 8). The effect size is consid-
ered to be large (0.80).
Because the one-sample t test showed significance in
the South region, but no other regions, a follow-up inde-
pendent samples t test was conducted comparing the South
region versus all other regions. The results demonstrate no
statistical difference was found between the South region
and all other regions combined, t(127) = -1.02, p = .311
(Table 9). Furthermore, a one-sample t test comparing the
three regions, excluding the South region, still found sig-
nificance compared with the baseline, t(92) = 2.14, p =
.0353, d = 0.45.
Finally, the study conducted an independent samples t test
between institutions that experienced athletics success in
basketball versus institutions that experienced athletics suc-
cess in football. The results indicate no statistical significant
difference between the two groups aforementioned, t(128) =
0.81, p = .418 (Table 10).

Discussion
The results of this study reveal a statistically significant
difference in the percent increase of private contributions
for institutions that experienced athletics success com-
pared with all higher education institutions (baseline).
The mean difference was 12.84% for the athletically suc-
cessful institutions versus 5.35% for the baseline group.
This was more than double an increase in the percent of
private contributions. The increase was even more pow-
erful because the baseline also included the athletically
successful institutions, which they (the independent
variable--athletically successful institutions) are being
compared against. These results indicate there are indeed
financial implications for institutions that are athletically
successful to reap the benefits.

The study found that regardless of public or private affili-
ation, history of athletics success, or region, those DI institu-
tions that experience athletics success, either in basketball or
football, saw a significant increase in overall private contri-
butions to their institution. These results are especially mean-
ingful because the impacts on the institution are of a financial
nature. These enhanced resources can facilitate desired
growth for the institution in manners it deems appropriate.
These resources and impact may have a long-lasting result
and cultivate future financial gains in the process. These
findings relate back to the resource dependence theory, in
that institutions are dependent on external stakeholders for
resources and, therefore, must be cognizant of motivations
and influencers those stakeholders may hold, which could
include athletics success (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978).
The study also found a marginally significant difference
between private institutions that experienced athletics suc-
cess compared with public institutions with the same athlet-
ics success. These results show there may be a particular
advantage to private institutions that experience athletics
success compared with baseline institutions. In this instance,
the impact is very noticeable, with a 28% increase over 2
years compared with a 5% increase for all other institutions
during the same period of time. This was more than five
times an increase for private institutions' overall financial
support compared with the mean percent increase for all
higher education institutions.
The results regarding the second research question were
evaluated by several statistical analyses. For differences by
region, all four regions were found to not be different statisti-
cally from one another by way of a one-way ANOVA test.
However, analyzing the data in more depth, the study found
the South region to be the largest in terms of percent change in
contributions over 2 years, 16.8%, while the West region had
the lowest value at a 9.25% change. The only region that was
significantly different versus the baseline independently was
the South region, t(35) = 2.36, p = .024, d = 0.80. This repre-
sents a large effect size, indicating a possible interaction effect
on the group as a whole as none of the other regions differed
significantly when individually compared with the baseline
using a one-sample t test. Another contributing factor may be
smaller degrees of freedom for each group individually, which
could account for why the other groups did not see a statisti-
cally significant difference from the baseline individually.
This was ascertained to be true by subsequent tests showing
the regions not differing from one another, and the three
regions (excluding the South region) showing significance
when compared with the baseline in a one-sample t test.
For the variables private versus public affiliation and
impact on institutions with athletics success, the study found
a marginal significant difference between the two in an inde-
pendent samples t test, t(127) = 1.92, p = .072, d = 0.34. The
effect size was considered to be relatively small. Examining
the two individually compared with the baseline, the study
found both to be statistically significant. The private institu-
tions that experienced athletics success had a mean percent
change over the 2 years of 28.2%, t(14) = 2.62, p = .020, d =
1.40. The effect size for the private institutions was very
large. This indicates a very strong relationship between ath-
letics success and the increase in contributions in terms of
percent for private institutions. The public institutions also
saw a significant difference from the baseline with a mean
percent change over the 2 years of 10.8%, t(114) = 2.24, p =
.027, d = 0.42. The effect size of 0.42 was close to a medium
effect size (0.50), but not as significant as private institu-
tions. This represents a significant finding for public institu-
tions, and even more so in regard to those with a private
affiliation. One thought on why this may be is the culture of
philanthropyatprivateinstitutionsismoredeeplyentrenched;
thus, as a result of an athletically successful year, it motivates
an already larger generous populous to contribute, compared
with public institutions. This is also verified as the top 10
institutions in percentage of alumni that give back are all pri-
vate institutions (The Alumni Factor, 2012).
For the variable history of athletics success, although a
difference in means between the two groups existed, the
study concluded no statistical difference between those insti-
tutions with a history of athletics success (M = 12%) com-
pared with institutions without a history of athletics success
(M = 14.3%). This suggests that all institutions regardless of
their history of athletics success can benefit from a year of
athletics success.
Testing of the last research question to determine whether
a difference existed between DI institutions with basketball
success versus DI football success, the study found no statis-
tical significant difference between the two. It was, however,
interesting to note that institutions with basketball success
exhibited a larger mean (M = 16.1%) compared with institu-
tions with football success (M = 11.9%).
The main result of this study, that DI institutions that
experience athletics success exhibit a significant difference
in private contributions, is congruent with previous studies
(Anderson, 2012; Howard & Stinson, 2008; Humphreys &
Mondello, 2005; Meer & Rosen, 2008). However, what is
unique to this study was the definition of athletics success
was more narrowly defined, and the data source utilized was
Table 10. Comparison of Football Athletically Successful DI Institutions Versus Basketball Athletically Successful DI Institution.

the VSE Survey, which were distinctive from the studies
above. Moreover, this study found significance utilizing this
data set where a previous study in 2007 by Humphreys and
Mondello using a similar database found no significance
from the years 1976 to 1996.
These current findings may indicate a shift in the influ-
ence athletics success plays in private contributions to insti-
tutions in the current environment. This study also differed
from previous studies, in that it accounted for multiple years
prior to and after the athletics success, for a more accurate
reflection of how the athletics success had a significant
financial impact on those institutions. Accounting for a
change over multiple years versus a single year after athletics
success provides additional validity to the study compared
with previous studies.
The results indicating private institutions benefit more
than public institutions may contradict the study by Howard
and Stinson (2007), which found less prestigious academic
institutions are influenced more by athletics success. Howard
and Stinson defined prestigious institutions as Tier I by U.S.
News & World Report. During the time of this study by
Howard and Stinson (2007), Tier I was defined as institu-
tions that ranked in the top 50%, currently institutions are
classified as Tier I if they rank in the top 75% (U.S. News &
World Report, 2012). Although the two studies' definitions
do not align, and a majority of the private institutions are
classified as Tier I, the findings are interesting to note and
surprising given the study's hypothesis. The difference in
means over 2 years was marginally significant between the
private and public institutions (28.2% vs. 10.8%).
Furthermore, Humphreys and Mondello (2007), in their
study ranging from 1976 to 1996, found basketball success
was linked to an increase in restricted contributions at both
private and public institutions; however, football success
was linked to an increase at only public institutions. In an
earlier study, Humphreys and Mondello (2005) defined
restricted donations as those earmarked for athletics, sug-
gesting that academic departments do not benefit from ath-
letics success at public institutions, although similar to
Howard and Stinson's (2008) findings, private institutions
did see an increase in academic giving.
This study found a relationship at both private and public
institutions and giving overall, which may be evidence that
there may be a shift in the donor's perception nationwide
regarding athletics and private contributions. One could
hypothesize back to the culture and environment discussed
in the "Theoretical Framework" section that relates to giv-
ing; stated that the mission, image, identity, and expectations
of the institution affect perceptions and, therefore, emphasis
placed on athletics success and giving. Organizational image
and identity theory relates to the identity and image portray
by the university as a result of the athletics success (Dutton
& Dukerich, 1991).
Next, the results comparing variables by region and his-
tory of athletics success are unique, in and of themselves
because these variables have either been lightly researched
or never been studied previously in this context and defini-
tion of athletics success. Particularly of interest, are the
results for the South region being significant when compared
with the baseline. This may represent an influential variable
on the data set as a whole.
Lastly, the findings on private contributions for basketball
success versus football success observed no statistical differ-
ence between the two. This was similar to the findings by
Humphreys and Mondello (2007) that found restricted giv-
ing appeared to rise at both public and private universities in
response to success of the basketball team, and at public
institutions when the football team is invited to a bowl game.
Implications for Operational Policy
There are 347 institutions that compete at the NCAADI level
in basketball and 124 institutions that field an NCAA DI
(FBS) football program (NCAA, 2013); for these schools,
the implications from these results are vast. The results from
this study help to quantify the return on investment in athlet-
ics programs in terms of overall private contributions to the
institution. This also does not take into account other intan-
gibles and possible indirect results from this athletics suc-
cess, such as increased applications, enrollment, improved
SAT/ACT scores of incoming freshman, enhanced national
attention/marketing/exposure, royalties from sales of mer-
chandise, community economic impact, television revenue,
and possibly enhanced image of the institution.
These findings may help justify and encourage those
institutions to invest in their athletics programs strategically
to reap these financial benefits. Administrators should have a
strategic plan in place well before the success occurs to take
full advantage of the benefits, much like institutions have an
emergency preparedness plan. By having a strategic plan,
universities will be able to capitalize on the marketing, expo-
sure, donations, and image to the fullest extent during and
immediately after athletics success. This thought relates to
institutional theory in which institutions should understand
external expectations and strategically align themselves with
the external environmental conditions, such as the impact
athletics success may create for their university (DiMaggio
& Powell, 1983). Each institution should prepare for as many
extreme instances as possible, both positive and negative.
This is especially true in communities that place an enhanced
emphasis on athletics success such as the southern region of
the United States as indicated in the results of this study.
This is especially true because the study found no statisti-
cal difference between schools with a history of athletics
success compared with institutions without a history of ath-
letics success. Excellent examples come from the recent and
surprising success of such teams including VCU, George
Mason, Butler, Boise State, and TCU. However, even insti-
tutions with a long history of success may benefit from
recent athletics success. In April of 2013, after Michigan
12 SAGE Open
made a deep run in the men's basketball NCAA Final Four,
Charles Munger committed US$110 million to the University
of Michigan, the largest gift to the institution (University of
Michigan News Service, 2013). Furthermore, the gift was
made after he was an invited guest of the university to the
Final Four, and his gift was designated for the academic side
of the institution to build a new graduate student hall. This
recent gift speaks to the power and influence athletics may
hold in donor motivations, even to gifts toward academic
initiatives.
Recommendations for Future Research
Although this study provided substantial and unique results,
not to mention added to continuing research on this subject,
several future studies should be conducted on topics related
to athletics success and the financial impact on universities
to expand on this relationship. To further this research, one
could examine in detail where the increase in contributions
was allotted within the institution. However, because most
athletics departments are subsidized, even if all the increase
went specifically toward athletics, the institution itself would
benefit by providing less of a subsidy, thereby saving
resources that could be allocated elsewhere based on priority
and needs of the university.
The relationship between private and public affiliation in
regard to athletics success should be researched further to
determine if a strong relationship exists. The sample size of
15 in this study for private institutions was rather small and a
stronger relationship may be found with an expanded study
of private institutions that experience athletics success.
In regard to region, there were no statistically significant
differences between regions that experienced athletics suc-
cess. However, the Southern region exhibited the largest
mean among the groups and was the only region to exhibit
significance on its own compared with the baseline. In the
future, conducting a two-way ANOVA accounting for athlet-
ics success in basketball and football by region would be
suggested. There may be an influential pattern found by sport
and region if further research is completed.
There are also several other direct and indirect financial
impacts of athletics success on institutions. Several recom-
mendations for future studies may include analyzing televi-
sion revenue and royalties universities receive and how they
may fluctuate based on athletics success. Also, the economic
impact of the athletics success may be examined in the com-
munity which the institution resides in, which associates
with systems theory, in that institutions have an interdepen-
dent relationship with their external environment (Berrien,
1968; Bertalanffy, 1968). Athletics success in relation to
donations relates to systems theory and how that success has
a direct and indirect impact across the entire institution in
regard to financial and perception values.
Finally, the ability to quantify the marketing, exposure, and
possibly enhanced perception or rankings an institution gains
from their athletics success would be of particular interest
because these variables are often difficult to measure but can be
very valuable financially in the long term. Simply enhancing the
alumni giving percentage can increase an institution's ranking
in the U.S. News & World Report marginally, which accounts
for 5% of the rankings (U.S. News & World Report, 2012).
