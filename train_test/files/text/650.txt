Behavior and First Pregnancy

ABSTRACT. Objective. Each year more than 500 000
children enter out-of-home placement. Few outcome
studies of these children specifically address high-risk
sexual behavior and adolescent pregnancy. Our study
investigated the relationship between living in kinship
or foster care and high-risk reproductive behaviors in a
nationally representative sample of women.
Methods. Data from 9620 women ages 15 to 44 years
in the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth were
analyzed in a cross-sectional study. Three groups--foster
(n  89), kinship (n  513), and comparison (n  9018)--
were identified on the basis of self-reported childhood
living situations. Bivariate and multiple linear regression
analyses were performed. The outcome variables were
age at first sexual intercourse and at first conception and
the number of sexual partners.
Results. After adjustment for multiple predictor vari-
ables, foster care was associated with younger age at first
conception (difference: 11.3 months) and having greater
than the median number of sexual partners (odds ratio:
1.7, 1.0­2.8). Kinship care was associated with younger
age both at first intercourse (difference  6 months) and
at first conception (difference: 8.6 months) and having
greater than the median number of sexual partners (odds
ratio: 1.4, 1.1­1.8). There were no differences between the
kinship and foster groups.
Conclusions. A history of living in either foster or
kinship care is a marker for high-risk sexual behaviors,
and the risk is comparable in both out-of-home living
arrangements. Recognition of these risks may enable
health care providers to intervene with high-risk youth to
prevent early initiation of sexual intercourse and early
pregnancy. Pediatrics 2001;108(3). URL: http://www.

In 1999 in the United States, approximately
547 000 children were in formal out-of-home
placement on any given day.1 Many more have
spent some portion of their lives in foster care. The
majority of these children are removed from the care
of their biological parents because they have been
physically abused (12%­25%), neglected (50%­75%),
sexually abused (2.7%­9%), or abandoned (9%­23%)
or have a parent who is incarcerated or otherwise
unable to care for them (15%­30%).2­6 Approxi-
mately 25% of foster children will live in 3 or more
foster homes.7
During the past decade, the most common type of
placement for these children shifted. Formal kinship
care, defined as placement by a child welfare agency
with relatives, is now the fastest-growing type of
out-of-home placement.8 Nationally, the percentage
of children who are in out-of-home placement and
were in formal kinship care increased from 18% in
1986 to 31% in 1990.9 In some states, it is as high at
50%.10 Increased use of kinship care has resulted
from an increase in the number of children who need
placement and a decreased availability of nonrelative
foster homes.11,12 However, a growing belief is that
kinship care may decrease the child's separation anx-
iety because placement with familiar caregivers may
be a pathway toward family preservation.13,14
The growth in the reliance on formal kinship care
has outpaced research that assesses its value as an
alternative to traditional foster care.15 The majority
of studies on the health and well-being of children in
out-of-home care have focused on children in tradi-
tional foster care; few have evaluated children in
formal kinship care,15­17 and very few have com-
pared the well-being and outcomes of children in
formal kinship care.18 Sixty percent to 80% of young
children in traditional foster care have at least 1
medical problem; 25% have 3 or more. Approxi-
mately 60% have developmental delays on screening
tests or experience mental health disorders.3­7,19,20
(J. Landsverk, unpublished data). The scant litera-
ture that specifically addresses children in formal
kinship care suggests similar rates of health and
behavioral problems.15,16 Furthermore, children in
traditional foster care continue to have difficulties in
adulthood, exhibiting greater educational, marital,
and risk-taking behavior problems.21­24 However,
the majority of long-term studies have used small
samples and often lack comparison groups; thus,

dren in out-of-home care.
Like formal kinship care, informal kinship care is
increasing. This type of living arrangement is not
sanctioned by a child welfare agency and may occur
for reasons other than abuse and neglect. In 1970,
1.4% of children who were younger than 18 years
were living with a relative without a parent; in 1997,
this number had increased to 1.8%.25 In 1997, 1.8
million children were in kinship care, 72% of whom
were in an informal arrangement.26
High-risk sexual behavior and early pregnancy
have an impact on the health and social well-being of
adolescents and young adults. Teenage mothers are
at greater risk for complications. They are less likely
to receive early prenatal care and more likely to be
poor.27 Irrespective of these risk factors, young ma-
ternal age itself is associated with greater risk of low
birth weight infants and of prematurity.27 In addi-
tion, adolescent mothers may be less accessible and
less sensitive to their toddlers and become engaged
in negative verbal communication.28 The children of
teenage mothers also are at higher risk for maltreat-
ment and for experiencing a change in their primary
caregiver, making teenage pregnancy itself a risk
factor for having children in out-of-home place-
ment.29 However, few studies have addressed this
issue among teenagers who have lived in out-of-
home placement.30,31 Recognized predictors of ado-
lescent pregnancy include membership in a racial/
ethnic minority group, poverty, younger age at
menarche, early initiation of sexual intercourse, his-
tory of sexual abuse, having an older boyfriend, hav-
ing dropped out of school, or exhibiting other high-
risk behavior (eg, substance abuse).32,33 It remains
more controversial whether childhood physical
abuse is associated with early sexual intercourse and
pregnancy.34,35 Community environments, parent­
child relationships, school connectedness, and peer
behaviors also seem to play a role in the teenager's
decision to initiate sexual behavior or become preg-
nant.33,36­38 Few studies address the role of foster or
kinship care as a risk factor for high-risk sexual be-
havior.
Using a nationally representative sample of
women, we evaluated the association of foster or
kinship care with high-risk sexual behavior and early
pregnancy. First, we hypothesized that women who
lived in foster or kinship care would initiate sexual
intercourse and become pregnant at a younger age
and have more sexual partners than women who
never experienced out-of-home placement. Second,
given the rapid shift toward placing children in kin-
ship care, we explored whether there was a differ-
ence in these outcomes between those who lived in
foster care and those who lived in kinship care.
METHODS
Study Design
This study was a cross-sectional study of the reproductive
outcomes of women who lived in either foster or kinship care,
compared with women who had neither of these experiences.
Data Collection
The data used in these analyses were from Cycle 5 of the
National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), a nationally represen-
tative survey of 10 847 civilian, noninstitutionalized women aged
15 to 44 years conducted in 1995. Women in this survey were
identified from the 1993 National Health Interview Survey. Par-
ticipation in the NSFG was voluntary. Data were collected from
face-to-face interviews and self-administered audio question-
naires from January to October 1995. Black and Hispanic women
were oversampled in the survey. Details of the survey, sampling
design, and implementation have been described.39,40
Study Population
From the total number of survey respondents, we used the
respondents' self-report of their childhood living arrangements to
define 3 subgroups: foster care, kinship care, and a comparison
group. The foster group (n  89) was composed of respondents
who stated that they lived with a foster mother and/or a foster
father during at least 1 living situation. The kinship group (n 
513) consisted of respondents who lived with any relative and
without either of their biological parents during at least 1 living
situation. If the respondent experienced both of the above arrange-
ments, then she was placed in the foster group because this was
hypothesized to be the higher risk group. The comparison group
(n  9018) was composed of the remainder of women surveyed.
Women were excluded from the analysis if they were foreign
born; if they were in the foster or kinship groups and had expe-
rienced only 1 living situation, to exclude women who never lived
with their biological parents and never experienced a change in
their primary caregiver; or if they lived in a group home at any
time during their childhood, because this population may differ
from those in either foster or kinship care and is at risk for worse
outcomes.41
Dependent Variables
Age at first sexual intercourse was defined as the age that the
respondent reported having her first voluntary sexual intercourse.
The age at first conception was defined as the age at first preg-
nancy. Number of sexual partners was identified using a variable
recoded by the staff at the NSFG to include information from both
the interviewer-administered and self-administered audio ques-
tionnaires. Although this was a continuous variable, it was highly
skewed and was, therefore, dichotomized at the level of the 50th
percentile for the number of sexual partners in the comparison
group (median number of sexual partners was 3).
Independent Variables
Demographic variables included in the analyses were race/
ethnicity (self-reported), age at the time of interview, educational
status, and whether respondent lived in a rural or an urban
environment at the time of the interview. Maternal and paternal
education were defined using the variable for the educational
status of the woman and man that the respondent perceived as
having raised her. Mother's marital status refers to the status of
the respondent's mother at the time the respondent was born. This
variable and the parental education variables will be used as a
proxy for household income during the respondent's childhood
because no survey questions directly addressed economic factors
during her childhood. A measure of the desire for first sexual
intercourse was derived from a rating of how much the respon-
dent desired her first experience of sexual intercourse (not neces-
sarily her first voluntary intercourse). Childhood sexual abuse was
considered to have occurred in women whose first sexual encoun-
ter occurred before 18 years of age and who responded that they
did not want it to occur or that it was a rape.
Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed using SUDAAN Statistical Software
(Release 7.5; Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park,
NC) to account for the multistage, cluster sampling design in the
NSFG. Bivariate analyses were performed using 2 and student's
t tests. Differences in outcome and predictor variables were as-
sessed between the comparison group and both foster and kinship
groups and between the foster and kinship groups.
Multivariate analyses were performed using multiple linear
2 of 6 FOSTER CARE AND ADOLESCENT SEX AND PREGNANCY
regression for the age at first voluntary sex and age at first con-
ception, and multiple logistic regression was used for the median
number of sexual partners. Separate models were constructed for
the foster and kinship groups, in relation to the comparison sam-
ple, for each dependent variable. The analyses for the age at first
conception excluded women who had never been pregnant. The
analyses for the age at first voluntary sexual intercourse and for
the number of sexual partners excluded women who were not
sexually active. Among the women who were excluded from the
analyses because they had not been sexually active or pregnant,
the differences among the foster, kinship, and comparison groups
paralleled those presented in Table 1 for the group as a whole.
To control for potential confounding, we included demograph-
ics, respondent and parental education, maternal marital status,
and desire for first sexual encounter variables in each model. In
addition, the age at first voluntary sex was added to the model in
which the number of sexual partners was the dependent variable.
The contribution of each variable in explaining the variance of the
model was calculated in the multiple linear regression models. In
the multiple logistic regression model, the 2 log likelihood test
was performed to assess the significance of each independent
variable in the model. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals
were calculated for all significant variables.
Given the sample sizes of each subgroup and using the age at
first conception as an example, we estimated that the study had
the power to detect a difference of 4.2 months in the foster group
and 1.8 months in the kinship group, relative to the comparison
group. When comparing the foster and kinship groups with each
other, we estimated that the study could detect a difference of 4.5
months.
RESULTS
The results of the bivariate comparisons are pre-
sented in Table 1. Although non-Hispanic white
women composed the majority of all 3 groups, the
kinship group was almost 30% black. In contrast, the
foster and comparison groups were 11.2% and 13.4%
black, respectively. In addition, the percentage of
women who were in the foster group and reported
an unwanted first sexual experience before 18 years
of age (the proxy variable for sexual abuse) was more
than double that in the comparison group (17.7% vs
8.1%); 12.5% of the kinship group reported having
this experience. Both foster and kinship groups dif-
fered significantly from the comparison group. Re-
garding the outcomes of interest, a history of living
in either foster or kinship care was associated with a
greater likelihood of being sexually active (foster vs
comparison group: P  .05; kinship vs comparison
group: P  .01) and having been pregnant (foster vs
comparison group: P  .01; kinship vs comparison
group: P  .01). Among the dependent variables,
there were no significant differences between the
foster and kinship groups. Because of this, multivar-
iate regressions comparing the foster and kinship
groups are not presented.
Predictors of First Consensual Sexual Intercourse
The mean age of first intercourse in the foster
group was 7.2 months younger and in the kinship
group was 12 months younger than in the compari-
son group (Table 1). After adjustment for known risk
factors (Table 2), having lived in foster care was not
a significant predictor of a younger age at first sex.
However, kinship care was associated with initiation
of consensual sex 6 months earlier (P  .001). The full
regression model for the kinship group explained
22.8% of the variance and for the foster group ex-
plained 22.5% of the variance in the age at first
voluntary sexual intercourse.
Predictors of Age at First Conception
The mean age of first conception in the foster
group was 21.6 months younger and in the kinship
group was 22.8 months younger than in the compar-
ison group (Table 1). After adjustment for the effects
of the covariates (Table 3), foster care was associated
with an age at first conception that was 11.3 months
younger (P  .05). Similarly, kinship care was asso-
ciated with a reduction by 8.6 months (P  .001). The

full regression models explained 30.3% and 30.1% of
the variance in foster and kinship models, respec-
tively, for the age at first conception.
Predictors of the Number of Sexual Partners
In bivariate analyses, women in the foster group
had twice the odds of reporting having had more
than the median number of sexual partners (odds
ratio [OR]: 2.0; 95% confidence interval: 1.2­3.1).
Women in the kinship group also were more likely to
report having had greater than the median number
of sexual partners (OR: 1.8; 95% confidence interval:
1.5­2.3). After adjustment for the covariates, foster
and kinship care remained significant predictors of
having had more than the median number of sexual
partners (foster group OR: 1.7; kinship group OR:
1.4) This pattern did not change substantially when
other cutoffs (eg, the 75th and 95th percentiles) were
used for the number of sexual partners (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
In our study, living in either foster or kinship care
was significantly associated with high-risk reproduc-
tive behaviors among this nationally representative
sample of women. Foster care was associated with
having a younger age at first conception and more
than the median number of sexual partners. Kinship
care was associated with a younger age at both first
consensual sex and first conception and with having
more than the median number of sexual partners.
Adjusting for multiple variables that have been as-
sociated with these outcomes did not negate the
findings. Of interest, there were no significant differ-
ences between the foster group and the kinship
group for any of these outcomes. It must be noted,
however, that our data cannot implicate placement
into foster and kinship care as the direct cause of
these high-risk behaviors. Rather, out-of-home place-

ment serves as a marker, reflecting the high-risk
homes from which these women were removed.
A child who has been placed in either foster or
kinship care may need closer attention with regard to
high-risk sexual behaviors. However, preventive ser-
vices for these youths may not be readily available. A
recent survey of all 50 states and the District of
Columbia, performed by the Child Welfare League
of America, revealed that child welfare agencies of-
ten lack programs that target sexuality among
youths in out-of-home care.42 This study found that
only 10 states had written policies that address sex-
uality education or family planning. One third of the
states had caseworker training programs, whereas
only 11 states provided training for foster parents.
Although it is crucial that child welfare agencies
address this need nationwide, health care providers
may be in the best position to identify these children
and to initiate early intervention services.
Kinship care is gaining in use across the country as
an alternative to traditional foster care, despite po-
tential concerns. Kinship care can be viewed as a
child-centered, family-focused pathway to family
preservation. Children who are placed with relatives
are more likely to maintain a continuity of schools13
and to know their caregiver. They also may experi-
ence fewer placements overall but often remain in
care longer than those who are placed in foster
care.15,17,43 Concerns exist, however, regarding the
placement of a child with family members who
raised the parent from whom the child has been
taken away.13,44 In addition, kinship caregivers may
be less likely to enforce court-ordered restrictions on
parental visitation.13 Across states, there are incon-
sistent licensing criteria for kinship caregivers,9,13
who also may receive fewer support services and less
supervision than traditional foster parents.13,15 As-
sessing the long-term outcomes of children who are
raised in kinship care, relative to foster care, may
give greater insight into the effects of these different
types of placements.
In our study, the women in the foster and kinship
groups did not differ from each other, clinically or
statistically, with regard to any of the outcomes that
we assessed. These findings suggest that living in
kinship care rather than foster care does not decrease
the risk for a female child for adverse long-term
sexual and reproductive outcomes. The survey does
not distinguish women in the kinship group who
were formally placed in out-of-home care by a child
welfare agency from those who changed caregivers
informally. Thus, the kinship group is heteroge-
neous, including women who changed living situa-
tions for reasons other than abuse and neglect.
This study has several limitations. First, this sur-
vey was not designed to examine either foster or
kinship care. There was no randomization to either
the foster or kinship groups, which could lead to a
selection bias in placement. It is not possible to de-
termine whether children who experienced more se-
vere abuse or exhibited worse behavior tended to
experience one type of out-of-home placement more
frequently than the other. Other variables that are
relevant to foster care, such as the duration and
number of placements, were not addressed in this
study. However, despite the lack of adjustment for
these placement variables, no differences were seen
between the 2 groups.
Second, the NSFG did not collect information on
the specific reason that a woman lived in either foster
or kinship care. Rates of physical or sexual abuse are
unavailable. This is important because out-of-home
placement could be a proxy for sexual abuse in this
study. The literature suggests a prevalence of child-
hood sexual abuse between 15% and 32% in the
general population,45­48 which often is underre-
ported. It is likely that women in the comparison
group also experienced some form of abuse. To ad-
dress this issue, we examined how much each re-
spondent desired her first sexual experience as a
surrogate for sexual abuse. Although this variable
likely underestimates the true prevalence of sexual
abuse, substantial differences were evident between
the comparison and study groups, and this variable
was highly significant in all of the models. This sug-
gests that this proxy variable captured much of the
true sexual abuse.
A third limitation is that this study represents
placement in foster care during the period 1951 to the
early 1990s. More recent developments in foster care
systems are not reflected here. In addition, secular
changes could have an effect on the outcomes eval-
uated in this article. We attempted to control for this
"cohort effect" by adjusting for the age of the respon-
dent in the analyses. The effect of secular change
may be 1 reason that being an older respondent is
protective in the models.
Last, the outcomes studied are based on the re-
spondent's self-report; thus, they are subject to recall
bias. However, the NSFG has been validated exten-
sively and uses methods that are designed to mini-
mize this bias as much as possible.39,40
The findings in this study have several important
clinical ramifications. Most important, pediatric and
adult health care providers should recognize that
female patients who are currently in foster or kinship
care or have a history of such a living situation are at
greater risk for the earlier initiation of sexual activity
and for the long-term ramifications of those behav-
iors. Second, this population of children and young
adults may benefit from collaborative interventions
and reproductive counseling from health care, edu-
cation, and child welfare professionals. Last, kinship
care may not be more protective than traditional
foster care with regard to long-term sexual and re-
productive behaviors. Although the findings of this
study do not examine other potential benefits of
kinship care, more research on formal and informal
kinship care, with a focus on long-term outcomes, is
needed to understand the effect of the shift toward
favoring kinship care for children in out-of-home
placement.
