Abstract
Eciency is considered a key factor when evaluating a bank's performance. More-
over, eciency enhancement is an explicit policy objective in the Single Market Di-
rective of the European Commission. But eciency improvements may come at the
expense of deteriorating bank prots and excessive risk-taking. Both the quantitative
eects and dynamic reactions of performance in response to eciency improvements
remain often unclear on both theoretical and empirical grounds. We analyze the dy-
namic relations between eciency and performance in the German banking market.
To this end we use panel data for all German banks for the years from 1993 to 2004
and estimate impulse response functions (IRF) derived from a vector autoregressive
model. The IRF estimate the response of a shock in eciency on prots or default
probabilities. The former is estimated with stochastic frontier analysis, the latter is
estimated with a hazard rate model. The results indicate that a positive unit shift in
eciency reduces the probability of default and increases prots. On the one hand,
we nd evidence that the long-run impact of prot eciency on risk is larger than
for cost eciency. However, cost eciency impacts with a shorter time lag on the
probability of default. On the other hand, cost eciency has on average a slightly
larger impact on prots than prot eciency.
Keywords: Bank performance, eciency, bank failure, vector autoregression,
performance forecast.

Non-technical summary
Cost and prot eciency are widely recognized as important determinants of
bank protability and risk. Empirical evidence on the magnitude and the dynamics
of these interdependencies, however, is virtually absent from the nancial economics
literature. In this study we estimate the protability and risk reactions to eciency
shocks (and vice versa). To this end we use a panel of German universal banks
between 1993 and 2004. A major problem in the model building process is that
eciency itself is also driven by protability and risk. We therefore develop a panel
vector autoregression model in order to account for endogeneity.
With the exception of protability, measured as return on risk-weighted assets,
we cannot directly observe the variables of interest. Therefore, we estimate cost
and prot eciency (CE and PE) with stochastic panel frontier analysis and use a
bank's probability of default estimated with a hazard rate model (Score) as a proxy
for risk.
Both measures are employed in a two equation dynamic panel model. From
that we obtain coecients for eciency and performance equations regressed on
lagged endogenous, performance and eciency measures, respectively. From here we
calculate impulse response functions (IRF) to quantify the magnitude and dynamics
of each eciency-performance pairing for all four measures.
We nd that positive eciency shocks signicantly improve bank performance in
subsequent periods. The eect of PE improvements on risk and of CE improvements
on protability are largest. Eciency shocks impact with a time lag of only two years
on prots and decay rapidly thereafter. The same applies for the responses of risk
to cost eciency shocks, whereas responses to prot eciency shocks display higher
lags of roughly four years. Compared to cost eciency the overall eects from prot
eciency shocks on risk are larger. Hence, banks that require immediate action
to reduce their probability of default may want to focus on improving their cost
management skills. Long-term reductions of risk seem more adequately targeted by
enhancing prot eciency.
In sum, improving eciency reduces risk and boosts prots. This result is robust
across various specication choices and IRF indicate that the eects are rather
persistent.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Kosten- und Gewinnezienz werden im allgemeinen als wichtige Bestimmungs-
gröÿen für die Ertragskraft und das Risiko einer Bank angesehen. Es gibt allerdings
kaum empirische Ergebnisse, die diesen Einuss nachweisen oder in ihrem Ausmaÿ
und ihrer Dynamik bestimmen. Der vorliegende Beitrag hat das Ziel, den Einuss
beider Ezienzarten auf die Ertragskraft einerseits und das Risiko andererseits zu
messen. Dazu wird ein Panel aller deutschen Universalbanken aus den Jahren 1993
bis 2004 herangezogen.
Ein Problem bei der Schätzung ergibt sich daraus, dass auch die Ertragskraft und
das Risiko die Kosten- und Gewinnezienz beeinussen. Um diesen Endogeni-täten
Rechnung zu tragen, wird ein Panel-Vektorautoregressives Modell entwickelt. Ein
weiteres Problem entsteht dadurch, dass die verwandten Gröÿen in der Studie mit
Ausnahme der Ertragskraft, welche hier mit dem auf die risikogewichteten Aktiva
bezogenen Gewinn gemessen wird, nicht direkt beobachtbar sind und deshalb sep-
arat modelliert werden müssen. Die Kosten- und Gewinnezienz werden mit einer
stochastischen Panel-Frontieranalyse bestimmt. Das Risiko einer Bank wird mit der
Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeit aus einem Hazardratenmodell gemessen. Aus den Vari-
ablen wird ein Zweigleichungs-Vektorautoregressives Modell geschätzt, jeweils mit
einer Ezienzvariablen (alternativ Kosten- oder Gewinnezienz) und einer Per-
formancevariablen (Ertragskraft oder Risiko). Um die Auswirkungen von Ezienz-
schocks auf die Performancevariablen zu bestimmen, werden aus den Schätzergeb-
nissen Impuls-Response-Funktionen für 10 Zeitperioden berechnet.
Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass positive Ezienzschocks in den Folgeperioden mit
einer signikant höheren Performance einhergehen. Besonders hoch sind die Wirkun-
gen von Gewinnezienz auf das Risiko und von Kostenezienz auf die Ertragskraft.
Auf die Ertragskraft wirken Ezienz-Schocks zwar mit einer vergleichsweise geringen
Verzögerung von etwa zwei Jahren, verlieren aber danach rasch an Wirkung. Auf
das Risiko wirken Kostenezienz-Veränderungen ebenfalls rasch. Gewinnezienz-
schocks hingegen entfalten hier ihre Hauptwirkung auf die Risikosituation erst nach
etwa vier Jahren und sind in der Summe länger anhaltend und wirkungsvoller als
Kostenezienzschocks. Eine mögliche Schlussfolgerung ist, dass Maÿnahmen zur
Steigerung der Kostenezienz geeignet sind, auch sehr kurzfristig eine Verminderung
der Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeiten zu bewirken, während sich substanzielle Risikore-
duzierung nachhaltig eher mittels einer Verbesserung der Gewinnezienz erzielen
lässt.
Zusammenfassend bestätigen unsere Ergebnisse, dass Ezienzverbesserungen zu
einem geringeren Risiko und einer höheren Ertragskraft beitragen. Dieser Befund
zeigt sich robust in allen unterschiedlichen Spezikationen unserer Untersuchung.

1 Introduction
On January 1, 1993 the Second Banking Directive was implemented by national
governments in Europe. It's aim is to enhance competition and the ecient provision
of nancial products and services in Europe (Benink, 2000). The objectives of the
European Commission (EC) have changed little since: to foster competition as to
further boost the eciency of Europe's nancial industry (EC, 2005). Regulators
and practitioners, in turn, are also concerned with the performance of banks. In
particular, nancial stability reviews by the Deutsche Bundesbank (2006) and the
European Central Bank (2006) monitor protability and risk.2
But to a large extent the relation between bank eciency and performance re-
mains a conundrum. After all, one fundamental theorem of welfare economics ne-
cessitates perfect competition for eciency. More eciency-enhancing competition
reduces prices to marginal costs, thereby reducing banks' prots or even forcing
them out of the market. Alternatively, banks on the brink of exit may be inclined
to take excessive risks in an attempt to gamble for resurrection when exposed to
constant pressure to improve eciency (Amel et al., 2004). Consequently, one may
ask whether we can have eciency and nancial stability as measured by protable
yet reasonably risky banks at the same time (Gorton and Winton, 1998)?
A number of studies theorizes on the relation between competition and nancial

2The use of the words prot and risk in the ECB's latest Review provides anecdotal evidence on
these proxies' importance: 847 and 2,158 times, respectively. Eciency is mentioned 1,719 times
and thus of importance, too. In contrast, the title word "stability" occurs only 589 times.

stability implicitly assuming the former to enhance eciency.3 Two views juxtapose
each other. For example, Allen and Gale (2000; 2004) advocate the concentration-
stability notion. They argue that atomistic banking markets, and hence ceteris
paribus more competitive and ecient ones, are more prone to crises for two rea-
sons. Competitive markets are characterized by poor protability, which implies a
lack of buer to absorb adverse shocks. In addition, supervision can be executed
more eectively for a low number of banks compared to monitoring a system of
many intermediaries. This view is contrasted by the concentration-fragility view.
Boyd and De Nicolo (2005) also posit that increased concentration boosts prots
but highlight that market power also changes the conduct of banks. Specically,
their model results in excessive risk-taking of banks if higher interest rates can be
imposed on customers due to market power. Beck et al. (2006) tests the relation
between competition (as measured by concentration) and banking system fragility
(as measured by banking crises) between 1980 and 1997. In short, they dene the
latter as periods when mean shares of non-performing total loans exceeded 10%.
They report results in line with the concentration-stability hypothesis, indicating
that further concentration as a response to increased competition actually stabilizes
nancial systems. However, Boyd and De Nicolo (2005) note that approaches using
relatively crude macroeconomic proxies for risk and competition may fail to cap-
ture important dynamics across banks. In this vein, they conclude that empirical
evidence, especially at the macroeconomic level, does not yield a clear picture so far.
Indeed, the micro economic variation across rms, and even products, is at the
heart of an important contribution by Goodhart et al. (2006). They depart from
the most common assumption of a representative agent but allow for heterogenous
agents and product markets in banking. The suggested general equilibrium model
combines individual bank behavior, especially risk-taking, at the microeconomic
level with monetary and regulatory policy at the macroeconomic level. The latter
determine interest rates and costs of bank default. One core result is the endoge-
nous possibility of trade-os between nancial stability and economic eciency. In a
companion paper, they forward numerical solutions from simulation exercises with
a simplied version of the complete model (Goodhart et al., 2004). Results cor-
roborate the previous conclusion of a possible goal conict between eciency and
performance. First, they nd that monetary and regulatory policy are non-neutral
and inuence both bank protability and default penalties. Second, they nd that at
the microeconomic level, heterogeneous agents and banks react dierently to shocks.
However, the authors caution carefully that especially the latter set of results de-
pends considerably on chosen starting values for their simulations and develop in
a hard to predict fashion. This suggests that the evolution of dierent aspects of
banking business, for example risk-taking on the one hand and eciency on the
other, depend in a complex manner upon each other.
Apparently, the exact dynamics of how bank eciency and performance relate to
3For example, theoretical models by Gorton and Winton (1998) and Perottia and Suarez (2002)
on the relation between competition and stability are both motivated by stipulating that deregula-
tion fosters competition and thereby the eciency of the banking system. Empirically, the relation
between (market) structure, (rm) conduct and performance represents an extensive literature in
it's own right. European banking market SCP studies are Bikker and Haaf (2002a,b) and Hempell
(2004). However, the SCP paradigm in itself is not beyond debate, see Bikker et al. (2006) for a
critical evaluation.

each other remain contradictory at the least if not unclear. Despite the dierences
in ndings, Allen and Gale (2004), Boyd and De Nicolo (2005) and Goodhart et al.
(2004) are united in their call for further research to provide empirical evidence
given the lack of consensus on theoretical grounds. Unfortunately, empirical tests on
the relation between eciency and performance of banks are to a large extent also
reections of the described ambiguity as we illustrate shortly. Therefore, we suggest
in this paper an alternative, agnostic empirical approach to provide evidence if
aiming at improved eciency, higher protability and reasonable risk at the same
time indeed is an attempt to square the circle.
To this end we use a panel dataset of German banks. First, we estimate cost
and prot eciency scores with nancial data. (In)eciency is the deviation from
an optimal cost and prot obtained from stochastic panel frontier analysis (SFA)
using nancial data of individual banks. Second, we observe protability also from
bank-specic nancial accounts. Third, we develop a hazard model to estimate a
bank's risk as the probability of default (PD). The hazard model in our context is
a rating model, which uses the correlation between a set of risk drivers observed in
a specic period and the default state observed some time after. Thus, we measure
eciency and performance directly at the rm level instead of having to follow the
theoretical detour via competition.
Next, we need to appropriately deal with encountered endogeneity between e-
ciency and performance. Endogeneity means that eciency and performance aect
each other simultaneously. The contemporaneous feedback implies that shocks in ef-
ciency impact on performance and shocks in performance impact on eciency. An
example of an eciency shock at the macroeconomic level is the implementation of
directives enhancing competition, such as the abolishment of guarantee and mainte-
nance obligations by the government ("Gewaehrtraegerhaftung" and "Anstaltslast")
for savings banks in 2004 (IMF, 2004). At the bank level, a typical eciency shock is
a restructuring program launched in period t. Presumably, such a program will not
only aect eciency but also prots of the current period. A typical performance
shock, on the other hand, is an economic downturn in a sector to which a bank's
credit portfolio is exposed. The downturn will cause high loan loss provisions, lower
prots and a higher PD. Contemporaneously, the performance shock may impact on
eciency, when the downturn induces the bank to enter in new sectors or markets.
The examples show that estimators for the impact from eciency on performance
have to be derived from a simultaneous model. To our knowledge this paper is the
rst to explicitly address this simultaneity between eciency, prots and risk.
A look on the data generation process conrms the necessity to account for the
interdependence of risk, return and eciency. Performance and eciency are both
calculated from data which refer to the same nancial statement. For accounting rea-
sons, the dierent balance sheet and prot and loss account positions are correlated.
For example, accounting rules imply that loan loss provisions are linked to prots,
which in turn are linked to equity capital. Data from all three accounts of the exam-
ple typically enter both, the eciency variable and the performance variable (PD
or prots). Thus already from a static perspective, eciency, PD and prots are a
conglomerate of correlated variables and are therefore correlated among themselves.
A third characteristic of our study is to account for dynamic interdependencies.
We consider a variety of lagged relationships between eciency and performance
3
since the eects from either shock will not be conned to one period only. In con-
trast, we expect complex patterns of contemporaneous and lagged interactions be-
tween both variables, which can hardly be modeled with a priori knowledge. A
way to deal with endogeneity and complex lag structures are vector autoregression
(VAR) models. VAR models were originally proposed by Sims (1980) as an alterna-
tive to structural models. The major dierence between VAR models and structural
models lies in the model building process. Structural models heavily rely on a priori
knowledge, whereas VAR models are more data-driven.4 In our case, VAR mod-
els have benets compared to structural models because the relationship between
performance and eciency is expected to be complex. At the same time there is
little (or no) a priori knowledge about the exact lag structure. In the following we
therefore estimate a (two-variable) VAR model for eciency and performance.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. We set out with a brief review of
previous empirical work on the relation between eciency and performance in section
2. In section 3, we introduce our theoretical concepts for estimating eciency, prots
and risk and the IRF. In section 4 we describe the individual bank data provided by
the Bundesbank and the regional macroeconomic data which we additionally use.
In section 5 we present and discuss our results. We conclude in section 6.
2 Empirical work on eciency and performance
In light of our study, empirical work on bank eciency and performance can broadly
be classied into two groups. Studies that explain bank performance as a function of
eciency and studies that specify an ecient frontier conditional on performance.
This observation alone indicates the necessity to account for interdependency on the
one hand and cautions to draw inference on causal relationship on the other.
Performance and eciency The literature on bank PD estimation to approx-
imate risk is abundant and dates back to the 1970s5 First generation bank rat-
ing models focused on cross-section techniques, such as discriminant analysis and
logit regression (Sinkey, 1975; Martin, 1977; Altman, 1977). More recent studies use
methods for panel or duration data (Cole and Gunther, 1995; Estrella et al., 2000;
Shumway, 2001). To our knowledge, Wheelock and Wilson (1995) provide for the
rst time evidence on the direct relation between eciency and banking risk. On the
basis of nancial ratios, which also include protability, and historical default data
they predict bank failures of Kansas state chartered banks between 1910 and 1928.
They use non-parametric, linear programming techniques to estimate rm-specic
eciency much more directly compared to earlier studies (Charnes et al., 1978).
4Structural models aim to t parsimonious models because coecient restrictions are necessary
to identify the model. Imposing restrictions in our model is problematic due to unknown feedback
relations between eciency and performance and, thus, potentially biased results. To avoid 'unreal-
istic restrictions', VAR models estimate an unrestricted reduced form of the underlying structural
model, which allows for a maximum of feedback relations. Identication of the structure is then
achieved by imposing a minimum number of restrictions. Hence, VAR models are parsimonious
in the number of restrictions, but not in the number of reduced form coecients estimated. This
allows the analysis of feedback relations and is therefore particularly suited for our purpose.
5A comprehensive overview on rating methods is (King et al., 2005).

Their results yield that ineciently managed banks are more likely to fail, thus pro-
viding evidence that higher eciency reduces the risk of instability in the banking
industry.6 In turn, Pasiouras and Kyriaki (2006) seek to identify the determinants
of commercial bank protability in 15 EU countries between1995 and 2001. They
motivate their research by pointing out that "adequate" earnings are necessary to
ensure the stability and growth of banks and, ultimately, the economy. They specify
a fairly a-theoretical reduced prot equation that includes bank-specic variables
and controls for macroeconomic conditions and ownership type. In line with other
bank protability studies (Berger, 1993; Demirgüç-Kunt and Maksimovic, 2002),
they nd that better capitalization, i.e. less risky banks, has a positive impact on
return on assets (ROA) and less ecient banks to exhibit also lower protability.
Eciency and performance Since it's inception in the late 1970s, the bank e-
ciency literature expanded beyond limits possibly reviewed within the scope of this
paper.7 However, only relatively few studies followed a suggestion by Mester (1993,
1996) to control for performance, especially risk, during estimation. Rather than
including controls in the frontier itself, some studies attempt to identify what is fre-
quently coined determinants of eciency by means of second stage analysis. They
ususally report a positive relation between eciency and protability proxies, such
as return on assets or equity (ROE) and interest margins, and a negative relation
with risk proxies, such as poor capitalization or high non-performing loan shares
(Vander Vennet, 2002; Pastor and Pastor, 2002; Casu and Molyneux, 2003; Carbo
and Williams, 2003; Girardone et al., 2004; Das and Ghosh, 2006).
A rst observation is that results are frequently inconsistent. Girardone et al.
(2004) report insignicant coecients for protability in many sub-samples and
that higher interest rate margins are negatively correlated with eciency. Similarly,
Williams and Gardener (2003) nd that eciency depends negatively on interest
rate mark-up's. This contradicts other ndings of higher prots to be related to
higher eciency. Likewise, results obtained by Casu and Molyneux (2003) yield
insignicant relations between risk and eciency and signicantly positive inuences
of ROE on eciency for only two years in their sample. Das and Ghosh (2006) nd
a signicantly positive eect of ROA on eciency but carefully note that the former
is endogenously related to eciency and therefore instrument ROA. But in their
discussion it remains unclear why endogeneity is limited to ROA. We argue that
any indicator, either performance or eciency, is based on nancial annual reports
and may thus suer from similar problems.
This relates to a second critique on studies using second stage regression to "ex-
plain" eciency.8 Any study of bank-specic data ultimately extract information
6Most subsequent papers conrm that eciency measures are signicantly correlated with lower
probabilities of default and market exit through mergers in numerous countries (Wheelock and
Wilson, 2000; Focarelli et al., 2002; Koetter et al., 2006). However, studies using multiple frontier
eciency measures report signicant correlations for only a some (Worthington, 2002).
7Excellent introductions to parametric and non-parametric frontier methods are Kumbhakar
and Lovell (2000) and Ali and Seiford (1993), respectively. The development of bank eciency
applications is reviewed by Berger et al. (1993), Berger (2003) and Amel et al. (2004).
8Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000) note two further problems. First, 2nd stage regressors are as-
sumed to be uncorrelated with frontier elements in the 1st stage. If they are not, eciency estimates
regressed in the 2nd stage are biased. Second, eciency is identically distributed by assumption in
the 1st stage. Estimation of a functional relationship in a 2nd stage is then paradoxical.
5
from the identical data generation process. Put dierently, measures for risk, prof-
itability, eciency and other indicators all emerge from bank's annual reports. Only
few eciency studies attempt to address this issue explicitly. Kwan and Eisenbeis
(1997) estimate a simultaneous system of four equations to account for both risk
and eciency being endogenously dependent. Three equations capture dierent as-
pects of risk and one species eciency as a function of the former three. They
nd that less ecient banks are more inclined to take risks. At face value, one may
conclude that competitive pressure to improve eciency may ignite excessive risk
taking. But Kwan and Eisenbeis (1997) also report that higher capitalization, i.e.
less risky banking, positively inuences eciency. They carefully conclude that their
results do not only suer from low explanatory power in statistical terms, but also
that the economic inconsistency of results warrants future work on the presumably
more intricate relation between risk and eciency.
In sum, empirical evidence at the microeconomic level measures risk, eciency
and protability more directly compared to the macroeconomic level. However, re-
sults are mixed and the earlier lack of theoretical guidance as to the direction of
causal relations remains. The endogeneity inherent in the data generation process is
usually neglected, let alone the dynamics of a change in eciency on performance.
Therefore, we derive rst auxiliary measures of eciency and performance as to
quantify subsequently the dynamic eects of both respective measures with a panel
VAR approach.
3 Variable Generation and Methodology
3.1 Eciency
Eciency analyses benchmark individual banks relative to a market cost or prot
frontier (Amel et al., 2004; Berger, 2003). Theoretically, the main function of a bank
i is to channel savings from surplus units to investors in need for funds (Sealey and
Lindley, 1977). Assuming perfect factor markets and cost minimization as objective,
banks demand input quantities x at given factor prices w to produce outputs y
such that costs C are optimal. To account for heterogenous risk proles of banks,
we follow the convention in the eciency literature and condition the production
technology T(y, x, z) on equity capital z. Solving this cost minimization problem
yields an optimum cost function C
i
= f(yi
, wi
, zi
). Observed costs are higher than
optimal costs either due to random noise or due to ineciency. Cost ineciency
results from the employment of too large quantities of factors given output and/or
a sub-optimal input mix given respective prices.
Humphrey and Pulley (1997) argue that cost eciency alone fails to evaluate
the ability of a bank to generate prots. They emphasize the necessity to study
prot eciency, too. Most prot eciency studies use their alternative prot model
where banks possess some output market power. This assumption is appropriate for
German banking given the regional demarcation of markets (Koetter et al., 2006)
and evidence of prevailing market power in regional credit markets (Hempell, 2004;
Fischer and Pfeil, 2003). Banks maximize prot before tax, PBT = py-wx, subject
to T(y, x, z) and, in addition, a pricing opportunity constraint H(p, y, w, z), where
6
p denote output prices. Note, that the ineciencies arising from the cost side are
considered in this model, too. Banks choose input quantities and output prices and
prot ineciency leads to lower than optimal prots PBT
i
= f(yi
, wi
, zi
). Since we
allow banks some price setting discretion within the boundaries of H(·), both cost
and alternative prot frontiers depend on the identical set of independent variables.
We use stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to estimate cost and prot functions as
well as cost and prot eciency (CE and PE).9 Recall that we are interested in the
long-run impact of eciency shocks on performance on the one hand and long-run
reactions of eciency to performance shocks on the other. It is therefore crucial to
specify panel stochastic frontiers that allow for time-variant ineciency. We use the
translog functional form to write a cost frontier as:10
ln Cit
= i
+
J
j=1
j
ln xijt
+
1
2
J
j=1
K
k=1
jk
ln xijt
ln xikt
+ it
. (1)
Here x consists of outputs y, input prices w, control variables z and a time trend
t. In any year t, a bank i can deviate from optimal cost C due to random noise vit
or
ineciency uit
. To distinguish these two eects, we specify a composed total error
it
. Cost ineciency leads to above frontier costs and the total error is it
= vit
+uit
.
Prot ineciency leads to lower than optimal prots, thus leading to it
= vit
- uit
.
The random error term vit
is assumed iid with vit  N(0, 2
v
) and independent of
the explanatory variables. The ineciency term is iid with uit  N|(0, 2
u
)| and
independent of the vit
. It is drawn from a non-negative distribution truncated at
zero. The i
's are allowed to be correlated with yit
, wit
and zit
(Greene, 2005).
Most studies estimate bank eciency over multiple years. But only few exploit
the additional information contained in longitudinal data. Parameters of equation
(1) are estimated instead as a pooled cross-section. This is problematic since this
approach implicitly assumes that individual bank's production is independent over
time, ineciency uit
is assumed to be independent of the regressors and point es-
timates of ineciency are not consistent (Kumbhakar and Lovell, 2000). In turn,
most panel frontier application treat eciency either as time-invariant (Bauer et al.,
1993) or impose substantial structure on the evolution of eciency over time (Bat-
tese and Coelli, 1988). In light of our interest to assess the long-run behavior of
performance and eciency, both model classes are inappropriate. First, we assume
by construction that shocks to performance lead to changes in eciency. Hence,
any time-invariant modeling of eciency is ill-suited to our ends. Second, we hy-
pothesize that eciency shocks, such as restructuring programs, are likely to cause
deteriorating eciency rst and to yield gains only after some implementation pe-
riod. Consequently, the development pattern of eciency should be allowed to be
non-monotonic.
Therefore, we use what Greene (2005) coins a 'true' xed eects frontier model,
which has two main advantages. First, eciency can develop unrestrictedly over
9Linear programming approaches are more sensitive to outliers due to the neglect of random
noise. Given well-known measurement problems with banking data (Mountain and Thomas, 1999),
we opt here for parametric methods.

time. The uit
is not parameterized in any way as a function of time and may thus
exhibit virtually any development pattern for a given bank i. Second, systematic dif-
ferences other than ineciency enter the bank-specic eect i
. In contrast to most
previous estimators, the latter is identied separately from the ineciency term uit
(Polachek and Yoon, 1996). Greene (2005) demonstrates by a Monte Carlo experi-
ment a substantially improved performance compared to previous panel estimators.
We use the conditional distribution of u given  to obtain bank-specic eciency
measures (Jondrow et al., 1982). A point estimator of technical eciency is given by
the mean of uit
given it
. Cost and prot eciency are calculated as exp(-uit
) and
equal one for a fully ecient bank. In the prot case, PE of 0.9 implies that a bank
realized only 90% of optimal prots that could have been realized with the identical
production plan. Likewise, in the cost case a CE score of 90% indicates that the
bank could have produced the identical output vector with 10% less operating cost.
3.2 Performance
We evaluate bank performance along two dimensions: prots and risk. The former
can be directly observed from nancial accounts and we dene our protability
measure prots before tax PBT relative to risk-weighted assets RWA as:
ROAit
=
PBTit
RWAit
(2)
In contrast to protability, risk is not observable and has to be estimated with an
appropriate model. We dene risk as a bank's default risk which can be assessed with
the probability of default (PD). Porath (2006) uses a time-discrete hazard model to
estimate the PD of German savings banks and credit cooperatives with a sample
similar to ours. Concerning the discussion of dierent rating models and the nal
choice we therefore refer to his study and estimate a similar time-discrete hazard
model.
Like any rating model, a hazard model transforms a set of (mostly) bank-specic
covariates observed in a given year t into the PD. The rating process can be thought
of as a two-step procedure where the rst step yields the score as a weighted sum
of the covariates. The second step transforms the score into the PD with an appro-
priate link function. The score weights can be estimated with historical data of the
covariates observed in t and the actual state of default in t + 1. In such a setting
the average PD of all banks in t is a predictor for the default rate of all banks in
t + 1. The individual bank PD in a given year PDit
is the probability that bank i
defaults within one year. The exact denition of default is largely determined by the
available data. In our dataset a default event is any event indicating that the bank
is in danger of ceasing to exist as a going concern.11 This denition corresponds to
the supervisory objective to prevent insolvencies.
Since Porath (2006) nds no signicant dierences between dierent link func-
tions we use the logit link function, which is the most easiest to handle. We write
the time-discrete hazard model as:
11We provide details in section 4.

Here, PDit
denotes the probability that bank i will default in period t + 1 and
Scoreit
is the score of bank i in period t. Scoreit
is calculated from

Xit,j
+ i0
+ 0t
. (4)
Equation (4) is a linear function of the set of j covariates Xit,j
observed for bank
i in period t and weighted with the parameters j
. Additionally, a set of time dummy
variables 0t
enters equation (4) in order to account for unobserved time-eects. The
unobserved individual eects i0
are assumed to be random because the alternative
xed-eects model requires a change of status of the observed endogenous variable
(Chamberlain, 1980). This would restrict the sample to defaulted banks.
Instead, the random-eects model permits the inclusion of the whole sample in
the estimation. Here we use the population average model proposed by Zeger and
Liang (1986). The population average model estimates equations (3) and (4) with the
Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) after replacing the (unobserved) variable
PDit
with a dummy variable Yit+1
. Yit+1
takes the value of 1 if bank i defaults in
period t+1 and the value 0 otherwise. The time lag of one year between the dummy
variable and the covariates determines the forecast horizon.12
Our covariate selection is in line with other bank rating studies (King et al.,
2005). We rst allocate covariates to dierent categories of risk drivers, where the
latter follow the CAMELS taxonomy used by U.S. supervisory authorities and other
central banks to monitor and assess banks. The categories comprise
Capitalization,
Asset quality,
Management skill,
Earnings,
Liquidity and
Sensitivity to market
risk. We then select the model which maximizes the discriminative power under
the restriction that it contains at least one variable of each CAMELS category. We
measure the discriminative power by the area under the Receiver Operating Char-
acteristics (ROC) curve. Typical to statistical rating analysis our dataset contains
a large set of similar variables. Capitalization, for example, can be measured with
many alternative ratios (e.g. Tier I capital per risk weighted assets , balance sheet
equity capital per balance sheet total, Tier II capital divided by risk weighted assets
etc.) which are variants of the same risk driver. In order to avoid multicollinearity,
we additionally require that the model does not contain variants of the same risk
driver.13
12The GEE method accounts for the unobserved individual correlation with the help of a working
correlation matrix which enters the estimation. We specify that all observations of one bank have
the same correlation, which is the standard exchangeable working correlation. The estimators are
asymptotically consistent even if the working correlation matrix is not correctly specied (Hosmer
and Lemshow, 2000).
13Additionally, we analyze the stability of the model with the help of hold-out samples and
separate estimations for dierent groups of banks.

3.3 Panel Vector Autoregressive Model
We rst estimate the reduced form of the model. Since our data is a panel of indi-
vidual bank observations we have to estimate the reduced form with dynamic panel
estimation techniques. This means that we regress all endogenous variables on the
lagged endogenous variables. The reduced form VAR model is a stochastic multi-
equation system. We obtain parameters by regressing the endogenous variables on
the whole set of lagged endogenous variables. Analyzing eciency and performance
results in a two-equations VAR with the following structure:
Effit

(6)
Here, Effit
and Perfit
capture one of our eciency variables, CEit
or PEit
, and
performance variables, ROAit
or Scoreit
, respectively. We use Scoreit
instead of PDit
because equations (5) and (6) are linear and the score is the linear transformation of
the PD. Combining both variables for each category results in a total of four dierent
specications for equations (5) and (6). The maximum lag order J of the right-hand
variables can be xed with statistical means using the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) and the outcome from diagnostic tests. To account for the unobserved time-
eects 10t
and 20t
in equations (5) and (6), we further specify year-dummies. We
handle the individual eects (10i
and 20i
) by applying the GMM estimation of
Arellano and Bond (1991) to equations (5) and (6). Note that the reduced from
depicted in equations (5) and (6) is a pure forecast model. As noted for example by
Sims (1980), this implies to refrain from analyzing individual coecients of these
estimations since we are primarily interested in error terms to calculate impulse
responses below.14
To this end, we solve the estimated model and obtain the moving average (MA)
representation. This is done by recursive elimination of lagged independent covari-
ates. Note, that it is exactly this approach that necessitates stationarity of the
dependent variables Effit
and Perfit
(Maddala and Wu, 1999; Im et al., 2003).
The MA representation shows how the endogenous variables depend on the lagged
residuals from the reduced form. The MA representation equates Effit
and Perfit
on present and past residuals e1
and e2
from the VAR estimation:
14One may regard the reduced form as a reection of the true but unknown structural model.
The latter contains additionally contemporaneous cross-terms of the respective sister equation.
Thus, the structural model cannot be estimated due to a lack of identication and simultaneous
equation bias, as would be the traditional approach to devise an explanatory model. Instead, a
VAR approach proceeds by estimating and subsequently solving a reduced form. On this basis, the
solution of the structural model is obtained thereafter.

Under the endogeneity assumption the residuals will be correlated and therefore
the coecients of the MA representation are not interpretable. The reason is that for
correlated residuals the ceteribus paribus condition is not reliable when interpreting
the coecients. Thus, the residuals have to be orthogonalized. We orthogonalize the
residuals by multiplying the MA representation with the Cholesky decomposition
of the covariance matrix of the residuals. The orthogonalized, or structural, MA
representation then is:

The orthogonal residuals can be interpreted as shocks: 1it
is a shock in eciency
and 2it
is a shock in performance. The coecients in the equations (9) and (10) are
the impact multipliers and give the current response of the left-hand side variable
to shocks occurring j periods ago. The MA representation with orthogonal residuals
is also called impulse response function (IRF). The IRF gives the response of each
variable included in the model to shocks from each of the variables for individual
periods. For performance and eciency the IRF provides estimates for the impact
of eciency on bank performance for the whole set of periods. The coecients of
the IRF are called impact multipliers because they measure the impact of a shock
in a single period. By accumulating the impact multipliers for all periods we obtain
the long-run multipliers which measure the overall response of performance to an
eciency shock. IRF and long-run multipliers answer exactly the questions raised in
our study. We are primarily interested in the impact multiplier 21j
, which reects
the response of performance to a shock in eciency for the dierent time horizons
j. But since there are no theoretically motivated priors, it also conceivable that
11
eciency responds to shocks in performance. An example for the latter kind of
shock could be a hike in credit defaults due to a random macroeconomic shock
such as a ood in rural areas.15 The upshot of our model is that we can assess the
dynamic interdependencies between eciency and performance with a minimum of
restrictions imposed.
The latter results from the orthogonalization of the residuals from the observed
residuals. The Cholesky decomposition involves imposing one restriction on the co-
ecients in the IRF because the matrix P results in an upper right element of zero.
As can be seen from equation (11) this implies 120
in equation (7) to be zero. The
kind of short-run restriction imposed depends on the order of the variables. When ef-
ciency is the rst variable in the model, we impose the restriction that performance
shocks have no instantaneous impact on eciency. In order to impose the instan-
taneous zero restriction on shocks from eciency to performance, we additionally
estimate a VAR model where the order of the variables is reversed and calculate the
IRF function. In line with the previously mentioned lack of theoretical guidance, we
chose two alternative short-run restrictions regarding zero contemporaneous impact
multipliers of eciency and performance, respectively: First, we assume that shocks
in eciency do not instantaneously impact on the performance variable. Second,
we restrict shocks in performance to have no instantaneous impact on the eciency
variable.
Both restrictions have dierent implications for the interpretation of eciency:
In the rst case, shocks in eciency are identied as those shocks which do not
immediately change the performance prole of a bank. In the second case, shocks in
performance are only those shocks without immediate impacts on eciency. To il-
lustrate the implications of both dierent restrictions we again refer to the examples
of a restructuring program (eciency shock) and the bank specialized in a sector
which experiments an economic downturn (performance shock). With the rst kind
of restriction, all the contemporaneous impacts of the restructuring program are
entirely attributed to eciency. In contrast, the contemporaneous eects from an
economic downturn are not restricted. With the second kind of restriction, the eco-
nomic downturn is restricted to have instantaneous eects on the performance only.
At the same time the restructuring program may induce contemporaneous shifts
on performance as well as on eciency. Both restrictions have shortcomings which
may bias the results: The rst restriction ignores all instantaneous eects from e-
ciency on performance and the second restriction ignores the instantaneous eects
from performance on eciency. Since there is no theoretical hint about which bias
is smaller we report IRF for both alternative restrictions and analyze whether the
results depend on the choice of the restriction.
4 Data and Auxiliary Results
We source our raw data from the Deutsche Bundesbank. It includes balance sheet,
prot and loss account as well as audit reports for all universal banks operating in
Germany between 1993 and 2004. In addition, we have access to the default database
15As happened twice during this decade in East German areas on the banks of the river Elbe.
12
of the Bundesbank for most of these banks between 1995 and 2003. On this basis,
we estimate eciency and risk proxies, respectively.
4.1 SFA and eciency
In line with the intermediation approach presented in section 3.1, we specify the
volume of funds channeled to agents in the economy as bank output captured by
interbank loans y1
, commercial loans y2
and securities y3
. To account for the increas-
ing importance of o-balance sheet (OBS) activities, we additionally follow Clark
and Siems (2002) and specify OBS as a fourth output y4
. Subject to factor prices,
banks demand three factors to produce this output portfolio: xed assets, labor and
borrowed funds. We approximate the price of xed assets w1
as depreciation over
xed assets.16 Labor cost w2
are calculated by dividing personnel expenses over full-
time equivalent employees. The cost of borrowed funds w3
is captured by the sum of
interest expenses relative to interest-bearing liabilities, mostly deposits and bonds.
Finally, we include the level of equity as a control variable z.
Tables 8 and 9 in the appendix depict parameter estimates of equation (1) and
mean values and standard deviations of bank production and dependent variable
data between 1993 and 2004, respectively. First, note that during the sample pe-
riod the number of banks almost halved. As noted by Koetter et al. (2006), most
of this consolidation is due to mergers and acquisitions rather than voluntary exits
or outright failures. In fact, they show that higher ineciency and lower perfor-
mance increases the likelihood of distressed mergers. However, the interdependence
of performance and eciency as well as the dynamic eects over a longer forecast
horizon remain unclear. Second, the importance to account for systematic dier-
ences between banks is underlined by large standard deviations of bank production
data.17
At the bottom of table 9 we depict mean CE and PE estimates from the xed
eect panel frontier model. Frontier diagnostics, such as a signicant ratio of sys-
tematic to random variance , support the specication of both cost and prot
frontiers.18 Mean CE is well in line with previous results reported for German, (Al-
tunbas et al., 2001), European (Vander Vennet, 2002; Berger, 2003), or U.S. banking
markets (Bauer et al., 1998).Our PE scores are somewhat lower compared to other
European or U.S. studies (Amel et al., 2004), but similar to those that use compa-
rable data sets and panel methods (Lang and Welzel, 1996; Koetter, 2006). Despite
growing bank production, rising total costs and consolidating markets, CE is very
stable over time. Apparently, relative performance was constantly monitored among
German banks. On the other hand, PE exhibits a rather volatile time pattern in
16Mountain and Thomas (1999) criticize that most bank eciency studies approximate theoret-
ically exogenous factor prices with bank-specic expenditures. Here, we calculate input prices that
banks face in regional markets (Koetter, 2006).
17One may argue that excessive heterogeneity requires the estimation of separate frontiers. How-
ever, comparing eciency derived from dierent samples is not possible (Coelli et al., 2005). For
example, 80% CE may be very good relative to one benchmark, but very poor in another peer
group. Thus, we estimate a joint frontier and account for heterogeneity with bank-specic eects.
18Log-likelihood ratio tests also support the translog functional form with a time-trend.
13
table 9 while protability continued to plummet since 1993.19 Apparently, even in
a period of steadily declining absolute protability, the relative prot eciency of
banks diered considerably.
The apparent lack of correlation of both eciency measures is well-documented
in the literature (Bauer et al., 1998) and underlines our approach to analyze both
eciency measures' inuences on protability and risk. Simple descriptive statistics
indicate to us that the long-term eects of shocks in the former are anything but
clear ex ante and therefore call for the VAR approach chosen here. Beforehand, we
turn to the estimation of our hazard model as to obtain risk proxies.
4.2 Hazard model and PD
To estimate the hazard model, we rst have to dene default events. While studies
of U.S. banks can rely on fairly clear failure criteria (Cole and Gunther, 1995; DeY-
oung, 2003), most non-U.S. studies have to approximate failure on the basis of some
nancial ratio's threshold. In contrast to the latter, we can observe failures from
the records of the supervisory authorities at the Bundesbank. The occurrence of six
dierent events is recorded and classied as distress by the authorities. First, the
announcement of situations that may indicate a restriction to the bank as a going
concern according to 29(3) of the banking act. Second, a decline of the operating
earnings ratio by more than 25%. Third, the announcement of losses in excess of
25% of liable capital. Fourth, capital injections by the respective pillars' insurance
schemes. Fifth, a takeover serving restructuring purposes. Sixth, forced closure of
the bank following a moratorium. Note, that the Bundesbank does not actively in-
tervene in any of these events but merely records defaults since it does not have
a legal mandate to, for example, close a bank or dismiss managers. Any legally
binding interventions are conducted by the Federal Supervision Agency of Financial
Services ('Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin'). However, the
Bundesbank conducts the ongoing supervision of banks and closely cooperates with
the Ban. Therefore, our denition of default is in line with supervisory policy in
German banking and we can refrain from having to dene some ultimately arbitrary
threshold level of a nancial ratio.20
Next, we select covariates to predict these failure events. We follow broadly the
CAMELS taxonomy described in section 3.2 and amend bank-specic covariates
to capture the health of the corporate sector and bank market structure of banks'
regional markets. Our dataset does not contain variables that adequately measure
liquidity and management skill.21 We therefore restrict the analysis to the categories
capitalization, asset quality, earnings and sensitivity to market risk. In total, our
model contains nine variables. Since we specify lags for each covariate of two years
to predict default events, our resulting sample contains 21,599 observations between
19Mean return relative to total outputs declined from 100 basis points in 1993 to just 50 basis
points in 2004. Poor protability trends apply to all banking pillars (Koetter et al., 2006).
20In contrast to, for example, U.S. banking markets, none of the banks in the sample fell below
the legally required minimum capitalization levels (Koetter et al., 2006). Hence, approximating
default on the basis of nancial data alone seems inappropriate.
21The Principle II liquidity reports are not available for the entire period and the management
quality of a bank could be assessed with qualitative information collected in on-site inspections.
14
1995 and 2003. Out of these, we observe 550 defaults. Using these data for failure
events and explanatory variables, we estimate equations (3) and (4) as described in
section 3. Parameter estimates and mean covariates for distressed and non-distressed
observations are depicted in table 1. The former are highly signicant and display
the expected sign. The area under the ROC curve amounts to roughly 0.76 which
indicates a good discriminatory power.

Consider the baseline results in column (1) of table 1 rst. We measure capital-
ization c1
with the equity capital ratio. Equity capital here also contains undisclosed
reserves. The negative sign of the coecient indicates that increasing equity capital
ceteris paribus lowers risk. Asset quality is measured with the ratio of total secu-
rities22 to all assets a1
and the ratio of provisioned loans or loans with increased
risk to the total of audited loans a2
. The negative impact of securities on PD can
be explained with a lower risk of securities compared to other assets. The opposite
applies to provisioned loans or loans with increased risk, which exhibits a positive
coecient in table 1. We capture the earnings situation with operating results di-
vided by balance sheet total e1
and the share of provisions of the operating results
22Including primarily money market and xed income assets.
15
e2
. As expected, the former enter the model with a negative sign. Higher operating
results ceteris paribus improve a bank's nancial health. In turn the latter indicates
increased risk as witnessed by a positive coecient. Sensitivity to share price uc-
tuations is measured with the share of stocks to the balance sheet total s1
. The
rationale for the positive sign of the coecient is the positive correlation between
the volume of stocks and the exposure to stock market price risk. The exposure
to interest rate risk is captured by the net xed interest rate liabilities s2
, which
also is positively correlated to default. Both ratios are rather simple compared to
the market risk indicators developed in recent years. However, more sophisticated
ratios were not available for the whole sample and the whole set of banks. The rst
regional control variable is the corporate insolvency ratio per district ('Kreis') INS.
It controls for the quality of the regional asset market and is linked to credit risk.
The second regional control variable is the mean market share per district. It ac-
counts for market power and therefore may be linked to both market risk and credit
risk. Both variables presumably have a signicant inuence on default because many
German banks operate on regionally conned markets.
We also analyze the discriminatory power of eciency. To this end we rst add
the variables cost and prot eciency to the hazard model, respectively, as depicted
in column (1) in the second panel of table 1. In both cases we nd no signicant
relation.23 But a hazard model with eciency as the only covariate yields a signi-
cantly negative impacts of prot eciency in (column 2) and cost eciency (column
3). Hence, eciency alone is a helpful predictor for defaults but the predictive infor-
mation is completely contained in other nancial ratios. This result underpins the
endogeneity of a bank's PD, performance and economic indicators such as eciency.
While eciency itself is signicantly correlated with bank defaults, the eminent
threat of default for the chosen prediction horizon can be retrieved more directly
by alternative nancial indicators. These, in turn, may in fact follow structural in-
eciencies of a bank. This endogeneity between eciency and other nancial ratios
thus supports our approach to use VAR-modeling and seems to be an appropriate
way to gain insight into the dynamic relationship between eciency and risk.
5 Results
We discuss rst specication tests for the VAR model and present next our results
regarding shocks and responses of eciency and performance, respectively.
5.1 Specication
Lag order The rst step in VAR-modeling is to determine the appropriate lag order
J of the reduced form given in equations (5) and (6), respectively. Lutkepohl (2005)
suggests to estimate models with dierent lag orders and then to choose the model
with the highest lag order that passes the diagnostic tests. We estimate the reduced
form with the Arellano-Bond-GMM (AB) estimator for the lag orders of J = 1, ..., 4
(Arellano and Bond, 1991) in table 2.
23Coecient estimates for other covariates hardly changed, as did explanatory power depicted
by ROC values in the bottom panels of table 1.

We report the AIC, the Sargan test of over-identifying restrictions and the
Arellano-Bond tests of autocorrelation for the whole set of our variables.24 We de-
pict results from the eciency equations in the upper panel and those from the
performance equations in the bottom panel.
The AIC criteria unanimously advocate the maximum lag order of four. In most
cases the Sargan test also turns insignicant for higher lag orders.25 Therefore, we
focus on the models with J = 4.26 Table 2 shows that the residuals from the re-
gression of PE on ROA and PE are autocorrelated. When reducing the model to
smaller lag orders the autocorrelation seems to vanish. This is counterintuitive, since
increasing lag orders should come along with reduced autocorrelation of the residu-
als. Potentially, this result is attributable to a loss of degrees of freedom. Except for
24We use the two-step estimator for regression diagnostics and the one-step estimator for infer-
ence about coecients because t-ratios of the former estimator are unreliable (Bond, 2002).
25The only exception is the regression of Score on Score and PE. Tests for autocorrelation of
higher order than four lags are infeasible due to sample size.
26Note that the AB estimator takes dierences of the variables in equations (5) and (6). This
introduces a rst-order MA-component in the model. As a result, signicant test statistics of rst
order autocorrelation do not indicate a misspecication.
17
three specications all remaining 4th-order models pass the autocorrelation test.27
Overall the results conrm that the model with four lags is optimal.
Stationarity As noted in section 3.3, our approach of solving the reduced form
to obtain the structural MA representation requires that the dependent variables
are stationary. Therefore, we test all four measures for panel unit roots for one up
to four lags. Since our panel is unbalanced we use an augmented Dicky Fuller test
in the vein of Maddala and Wu (1999) rather than the Im-Pesaran-Shin test (2003).
The according tests statistics are depicted in table 3.

Our results pertain that we can reject the hypothesis of non-stationarity for all
four series. While this does not imply per se that resulting IRF are reasonable,
stationarity is a necessary condition for our methodology. Consider therefore next
the respective shocks and according responses of both eciency and performance,
respectively.
5.2 Shocks and responses
We calculate two separate Impulse Response Functions (IRF) for each eciency-
performance pairing depicted in gures 1 through 4, respectively. The rst impact
multiplier restriction (IMR) entails that the instantaneous impact multiplier of per-
formance in the equation for eciency is zero. The second IMR is that the instan-
taneous impact multiplier of eciency in the equation of performance is zero. We
also show 90%-condence intervals for the IRF.28 To ease interpretation, we further
divide the coecients in equation (9) by 110
and the coecients in equation (10)
by 220
. The transformed coecients represent the response to unit shocks.29 The
27The specications Score on Score and PE and on Score and CE as well as PE on Score and
PE, respectively, yield signicant autocorrelation of higher order than one, albeit only at the 5%
percent level.
28For the calculation of the condence intervals we randomly draw 1,000 sets of values for the
coecients in the VAR model with the estimated mean and standard error and calculate the IRF
afterwards based on this model. The 90% condence interval is then given by the 5% and 95%
percentile of the simulated IRF distribution.
29We also calculated IRF on the basis of shocks of one standard error. Results are qualitatively
not aected.
18
corresponding long-run multipliers (LRM) are reported for each of the four pairings
investigated, too.30
Cost eciency shocks We are most interested in the performance responses to
shocks in eciency. Consider to this end gure 1, which depicts the relations between
CE shocks and both Score and ROA responses, respectively.

Cost efficiency shocks and performance responses
Impulse Response Function
Regarding the dynamics of a CE shock on risk as measured by Score, consider the
IRFs in the upper panel of gure 1. Independent of the chosen restriction, both
exhibit large responses in the period after the occurrence of the shock. Afterwards
the responses continuously and rapidly decay. Responses nally turn insignicant
after about four periods. The empirical evidence therefore conrms the role of ef-
ciency as an eective target when aiming at lowering a bank's risk. Our results
for cost eciency improvements thus support the view that the political objective
of enhancing eciency does not jeopardize the average riskiness of German banks.
This is corroborated by odds ratios calculated from the long-run multipliers, which
we report in table 4. For CE the odds ratio implies that a unit shock lowers the
odds to default by about 10 to 20 percent. This underpins that targeting eciency
improvements can yield substantial and sustained reductions of risk.
Apart from reducing risk, a shock in CE furthermore improves bank protability
considerably as shown in the bottom panel of gure 1. Shocks reach their maximal
impact approximately after one year, wear out very rapidly and do virtually not exist
anymore after the second period. While the restriction choices lead to somewhat
30As noted earlier, long run multipliers are calculated on the basis of the estimated reduced
form model. While the latter is ill-suited for direct inference due it's forecasting nature, we depict
individual parameter estimates for completeness in table 10 in the appendix.

dierent evolution paths of ROA in the immediate aftermath of a CE shock, the
short-run nature of eects is robust for both. The cumulative eects for shocks from
cost eciency are approximately 0.4. Thus, cost eciency improvements lead to an
immediate increase of prots but only to limited long-run eects.
In sum, both impulse-response functions and long-run multipliers show that in
all periods where the responses are signicantly dierent from zero, higher cost
eciency lowers risk and increases prots. The choice of restrictions seems to be of
minor importance for most of our results as witnessed by similar long-run multipliers
for the dierent restrictions reported in table 4.
Prot eciency shocks A number of bank eciency studies demonstrate that
cost eciency alone may not reect the full picture of bank's ability to manage
their business appropriately in competitive markets. European banking studies em-
phasizing the importance to analyze also prot eciency are, for example, Altunbas
et al. (2001) or Maudos et al. (2002). They argue that ongoing deregulation and
increased competition from non-bank nancial intermediaries necessitates not only
ecient cost management. It is at least equally important to supply a vector of out-
puts in correct proportions. In the same vein, much of the legislative initiatives to
create a level playing eld in European banking aim especially at increasing prot
eciency in the sense of providing customers with the desired range of nancial ser-
vices at optimal prices. But, for example, the European Central Bank (2005) point
out that such prot eciency improvements imply increased pressure on margins,
thereby reducing prots. Eorts to enhance eciency may even induce excessive
risk-taking in an attempt to defend market shares. To assess the consequences of a
shock to PE consider gure 2.
Instantaneously, the impact of a shock in PE on risk is small and even declining
during the rst years. However, eciency changes exhibit a high persistence and
reach their maximum after four years. The long-run eect on score is about -0.4
(for the restriction on PE) and -0.3 (for the restriction on Score) according to our
results shown in table 5. As for cost eciency, we also report the odds ratios and
nd that a unit shock in PE lowers the odds to default by about 25 to 35 percent.
Thus, prot eciency has a larger impact on PD compared to cost eciency. On
the other hand, cost eciency impacts immediately on PD while the eects from
prot eciency unfold completely only after four years. A possible policy implication
from this nding is that cost eciency is an appropriate target for banks that aim

enhancing the long-run risk prole of a bank.

With respect to protability, PE shocks mimic the dynamics of cost eciency
shocks. The eects on ROA reach their maximal impact after one year and vanish
quickly in subsequent periods yielding an overall eect of 0.3. Thus, both types
of eciency improvements come along with an immediate increase of prots. The
long-run eects from cost eciency, however, are larger compared to prot eciency.
Cost eciency responses By means of examples we considered so far eciency
shocks, which may either emanate from macroeconomic or microeconomic changes.
An example of the former are deregulation eorts such as the introduction of a single
banking license in Europe. An example for the latter are restructuring programs or
replacement of incumbent managers. However, we need to acknowledge that none
of these examples is founded in theory. In fact, it is also perfectly conceivable that
performance shocks occur and eciency changes in response to that. Due to this
lack of theoretical guidance, which exists in macroeconometric VAR applications,
for example, by modeling monetary shocks, we also report results for cost and prot
eciency responses to performance shocks, respectively. In the top panel of gure 3
21
we depict to this end CE responses to a unit shock in Score.

Impulse Response Function
In contrast to the reverse relation of shocks in CE and resulting Score responses
depicted earlier, our results show that a shock in risk actually increases CE sig-
nicantly for up to ten years. While the dynamics dier slightly according to the
choice of restriction (see right panel in gure 3), the bottom line remains quali-
tatively robust. This response of eciency to shocks in Score may reect banks'
eorts to change eciency when performance is deteriorating. Increasing risk comes
along with a long-run increase in cost eciency, which peaks after approximately
three years before the responses decline slowly thereafter. Apparently, banks focus
on improving their ability to provide nancial services cost eciently after having
experienced a shock in PD.

The response of CE on protability shocks regarding both the shape of the
impulse response functions and the magnitude of the long-run multipliers depicted
in table 6 also dier across restriction choices. Short-run restrictions on eciency
22
lead to lower long-run multipliers (0.1 for CE) than short-run restrictions on prots
(0.5 for CE). Robust to the short-run restriction is that in all cases the impacts on
cost eciency are positive, yet very volatile, and last around four years.
Prot eciency responses As can be seen from gure 4, the reverse relation be-
tween Score and PE diers from the reverse relation with cost eciency. Increasing
risk has only small positive eects on prot eciency. Impulse response functions for
both multiplier restrictions yield mostly insignicant eects after two years. Hence,
prot eciency seems to be hardly aected by sudden changes in the risk prole of
the bank.

Impulse Response Function
The responses of eciency on protability shocks also depend on the choice of the
restriction, as indicated by dierent shapes of the impulse response functions and
the magnitude of the long-run multipliers. Short-run restrictions on eciency lead to
lower long-run multipliers (zero for PE and 0.1 for CE) than short-run restrictions
on prots (0.2 for PE and 0.5 for CE). Robust to the short-run restriction is that in
all cases the impacts on cost eciency are higher than on prot eciency and that
the overall eect is positive. A positive impact from prot shocks on eciency sug-
gests that, in contrast to risk shocks, banks do not react to protability shocks with
eciency enhancing measures. Potentially, these two dimensions of performance are
regarded as substantially dierent problems that each require alternative manage-
ment reactions.31
31For example, banks may indeed target eciency after risk shocks but may try to acquire
market power through mergers (Amel et al., 2004), or boost sales by entering new markets after a
protability shock (Berger et al., 2003).

But given the volatile pattern of eects, their bare signicance and the very low
magnitude, we are more inclined to hypothesize that the relation between protabil-
ity shocks and eciency reactions is simply weak. Perhaps the long-run nature of
many eciency enhancing measures, such as restructuring projects, is simply con-
sidered an inappropriate management tool to react to declining prots.
To sum up, our results conrm that eciency is a powerful means to enhance a
bank's performance. Both, cost and prot eciency shocks increase prots and de-
crease risk. Cost eciency impacts with a shorter time lag on probability of defaults
than prot eciency at the expense of a lower long-run eect. Cost eciency, on
the other hand, has a slightly larger overall eect on prots. By and large, results
are robust to the dierent restrictions used in our estimation and only protability
shocks and responses exhibit alternative dynamics subject to this choice.
6 Conclusion
In this paper we suggest a VAR approach to model and quantify the intricate in-
terrelations between bank eciency, risk and protability. While our approach is
antithetic to recent theoretical developments of general equilibrium models, such as
in Goodhart et al. (2006), we aim to contribute complementary agnostic evidence
on the issue if eciency gains and sustained performance are mutually exclusive
objectives. In short, we nd for the German banking market that both objectives
do not contradict each other.
We use a sample of German universal banks between 1993 and 2004. On the one
hand, we measure cost and prot eciency (CE and PE) with stochastic frontier
analysis. On the other, we approximate a bank's risk with a hazard model using
historical distress data provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank. These measures are
then employed to estimate a dynamic panel VAR. In line with theoretical predictions,
we nd indeed that eciency and performance measures exhibit complex interde-
pendencies. Both determine each other both contemporaneously and over time. To
quantify the long-term dynamic eects of shocks in either of our measures, we calcu-
late impulse response function for a forecast horizon of ten years. Our main ndings
are as follows.
First, we nd that both kinds of eciency improvements reduce risk and increase
protability. The largest cumulative long-term eects are those of PE shocks on risk
and CE shocks on protability. Consequently, bankers are well-advised to target ef-
24
ciency improvements since they can yield sustained and pronounced improvements
in protability and risk.
Second, the dynamics of shocks and eects dier across our four eciency and
performance measures respectively. While CE improvements reduce the risk of a
bank immediately, PE improvements fully unfold only after four years but impact
for as long as up to 10 years. Thus, bankers and/or regulators that see need for
immediate action to reduce a bank's probability of default may want to focus on
cost eciency. In turn, sustained risk reduction warrants a stronger focus on the
bank's relative ability to maximize prots given its production plan.
Third, interactions between eciency and performance are asymmetric. Higher
eciency reduces risk, but increases in risk lead to higher eciency, especially on the
cost side. This result suggests that bankers aim especially at cost eciency improve-
ments, for example by means of restructuring programs, after having experienced a
risk shock. In turn, higher eciency aects protability positively and vice versa.
Thus, bankers seem to react only to shocks in their riskiness by improving eciency
while protability declines are according to our results no spark to launch eciency
improvements.
To our knowledge, our results provide for the rst time empirical evidence about
the dynamic interdependencies of eciency and performance. The quantication of
shocks and responses show that eciency improvements are a useful target to im-
prove protability and reduce risk. Our ndings suggest that eciency enhancing
measures, for example the promotion of more competition, do not bear immediate
dangers of excessive risk-taking or sudden protability distortions. Our results re-
garding dierent timing patterns of these eects may be of interest to policy makers
and regulators as well as bankers and consumers of nancial services alike.
Clearly, this research is at the same time subject to a number of limitations,
which warrant future research. First, our model does not explicitly allow for conta-
gion eects across banks. This is an important limitation when drawing inference
for policy-making at the macroeconomic level. Second, the VAR methodology sug-
gested here is completely a-theoretical. Future extensions should aim to follow the
developments of macroeconomic VAR modelling and devise structural VARs. Specif-
ically, augmenting the model for an explicit competition equation along the adjusted
PR-approach of Bikker et al. (2006) seems challenging yet promising in this respect.
Finally, our model does not account explicitly for (cross-border) bank market con-
solidation, which certainly is an important item on policy makers' agendas, too.
