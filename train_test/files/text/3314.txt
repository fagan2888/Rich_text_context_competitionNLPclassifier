Translational Research

Abstract: The zebrafish is gaining popularity in behavioral brain research. It may be a
cost-effective tool with which we can improve our understanding of the biological and
genetic mechanisms of human brain function and dysfunction. Some, myself and
collaborators included, have argued that such translational relevance may be best achieved
if one considers the ecology and species-specific characteristics of the study organism. In
this review, I focus on our own studies investigating zebrafish fear responses, which may
be utilized in analyzing the mechanisms of fear and anxiety, and which may be used for
screening anxiolytic drugs. I review how zebrafish respond to their natural and synthetic
alarm substance as well as to other fear-inducing stimuli, including sympatric and allopatric
predatory fish, sympatric or allopatric harmless fish, moving (animated) images of
predatory fish and moving images of abstract shapes. I discuss the behavioral responses
these stimuli elicit, summarize the methods of the quantification of the behaviors, and
speculate about their possible adaptive nature. Although we utilize complex visual stimuli
and do not yet know what key features zebrafish may be sensitive to, our results, together
with those published by others, imply that this simple vertebrate may have a bright future in
behavioral brain research.

Introduction
The zebrafish has moved to the forefront of developmental biology and genetics
after four decades of research with this species (Grunwald and Eisen, 2003). An increased
number of articles recently published attests to the fact that it is also gaining popularity in
behavioral brain research (e.g., Gerlai, 2010a, 2011; Sison, Cawker, Buske, and Gerlai,
2006). Many of the papers published on the behavior of this species are motivated by the
notion that one may utilize this simple vertebrate as a tool with which the mechanisms of
complex human diseases, including brain disorders, may be investigated. The main
rationale is that research with zebrafish would be more cost effective than with humans or
Zebrafish fear

with any other vertebrate model organisms, including the rat or the house mouse. I and
others (Guo, 2004) have argued that zebrafish strike an optimal compromise between
system complexity and practical simplicity (Gerlai, 2010a). Practical simplicity comes from
such features of the zebrafish as its small size (4 cm long), prolific nature (a single female
can spawn 3-4 times a week, producing 200 eggs each time), and the fact that it is a highly
social species (a shoaling fish that prefers and thus can be kept at high density) (Miller and
Gerlai, 2007; Saverino and Gerlai, 2008). On the other hand, the zebrafish is a complex
organism. It is a vertebrate species with a typical vertebrate brain layout and vertebrate
physiology (e.g., Alsop and Vijayan, 2008; Chatterjee and Gerlai, 2009; Tropepe and Sive,
2003). Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly, if a zebrafish gene is identified as being
involved in an important biological function, it is likely that a human homolog may be
discovered that also serves a similar or related function (e.g., Reimers, Hahn, and Tanguay,
2004; Renier et al., 2007). This is because the nucleotide sequence of zebrafish and human
genes has been found highly homologous, around 70% on average. Furthermore, nucleotide
sequences corresponding to the functionally relevant binding regions of proteins often
exceed 90% homology between these two species (Reimers et al., 2004; Renier et al., 2007
and references therein).
Although our knowledge about the genetics and biology, including neurobiology, of
zebrafish is rapidly increasing, the behavioral features of this species remain elusive or
underexplored at best (Gerlai, 2011; Sison et al., 2006). Perhaps one reason why it is often
difficult to investigate the behavior of a novel model organism such as zebrafish is that
each species possesses idiosyncratic characteristics, and previous behavioral test paradigms
developed for other species cannot be readily adopted (Gerlai, 2001). Although some have
stated that the best way to achieve generalization (i.e., translational relevance) is if one
ignores these species-specific characteristics, we (Gerlai, 2001, 2002; Gerlai and Clayton,
1999) and others (Blanchard, Griebel, and Blanchard, 2003 and references therein), have
argued the opposite. We think that in order to understand the biological and genetic
mechanisms of certain complex features, such as behavior, one needs to know how the
behavior may be elicited, how it may manifest, and how it can be quantified under the
confines of the laboratory. These elements may be specific to the target species and may be
dependent upon its evolutionary past and ecology. Our previous, seemingly trivial, example
illustrates this point (Gerlai and Clayton, 1999). We argued that it is not useful to study, for
example, learning and motivation across multiple species by using the exact same methods.
Imagine how a rat would respond to a stack of 100 dollar bills and what a human subject
would think if offered a bowl of tasty rat chow as reward in a comparative learning study.
Our argument was simple: The best way to analyze translationally relevant mechanisms is
to design experiments in which the natural behavior of the subjects is utilized. Forcing the
study species into artificial situations may lead to confusing result and may not allow one
to tap into functionally homologous neural mechanisms (Gerlai, 2001).
It may be easy to see the above point, but it may not be so simple to put it into
practice. How do we know which test is ethologically/ecologically appropriate? How do we
decide what is natural or what is artificial for our chosen study species? These questions are
not trivial to answer, a fact that is also demonstrated by the following review. In this review
I discuss our own first attempts to investigate zebrafish fear responses (Gerlai, 2010b). Our
Zebrafish fear

ultimate goal is to develop behavioral test methods with which robust fear can be induced
and in a reliable manner. Such paradigms then could be utilized in the analysis of the
mechanisms of fear, for example, by searching for interesting mutants in a pool of ENU
mutagenized zebarfish. Alternatively, such paradigms may, for example, be used in large
scale drug screens for the identification of anxiolytic or anxiogenic compounds.
In the following pages I review our own efforts with olfactory cues, live stimulus
species, as well as animated images that are expected to induce fear responses in zebrafish.
I discuss why we believe some of our methods may have ethological relevance and I also
discuss the difficulties with this notion. But before I start this review, I first present a short
overview on the relatively small amount of information known about the ecology and
natural habitat of zebrafish.
Zebrafish in Nature
Only very few studies have explored the natural habitat and ecology of zebrafish
per se. These have been reviewed in two recent papers (Engeszer, Patterson, Rao, and
Parichy, 2007; Spence et al., 2006) that also significantly added to this topic by conducting
original field studies. The zebrafish is a freshwater species that inhabits small lakes and
ponds, slow-moving streams, and rice paddies in a large geographic range that extends
from Pakistan in the west to Myanmar (Burma) in the east, and from Nepal in the north to
the Indian state of Karnataka in the south. The abiotic characteristics of waters of this large
geographic region vary. Water temperature may range from 15 to 39 Co (including seasonal
and daily temperature cycles), pH between 5­8.2 and conductivity between 10-300 µS.
Zebrafish may be found in clear or turbid water and waters with silt or gravel/rocky bottom.
The biotic environment of zebrafish contains a lot of shoaling species related to zebrafish
(e.g., Danio and Devario), similar in body size and behavior to zebrafish. These fish may
compete with zebrafish for food or other resources, such as mating sites. Numerous
predatory fish coinhabit the water with zebrafish too. For example, Channa (snakehead
fish), Xenentodon (needle or garfish), Notopterus (knife fish), Mystus (catfish) species and
zebrafish have been caught from the same habitats. Furthermore, the geographic
distribution of Nandus nandus (Indian leaf fish) also coincides with that of zebrafish. In
addition to predatory fish, zebrafish may also be preyed upon by dragonfly larvae as well as
fishing birds (Spence et al., 2006), including the Indian pond heron (Ardeola grayii) and
the common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis).
Spence et al. (2006) recorded several features of the zebrafish habitat and conducted
a correlation analysis (Principal Component Analysis) to investigate whether certain
characteristics correlate with the abundance of zebrafish. They found negative correlations
between abundance of zebrafish and water depth, water flow, transparency, and the
presence of predators, respectively, among other variables. Under semi-natural conditions,
Spence et al. (2006) also investigated the vertical position of zebrafish and found this
species to predominantly prefer the upper third water layer in an 84 cm deep tank, but also
to spend some time in the bottom third layer, while mostly avoiding the middle part of the
tank.
Reproductive behavior of zebrafish has not been observed in nature, but Engeszer et
Zebrafish fear
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -594-
al. (2007) cites a report stating that the breeding season of zebrafish is between April and
August, which coincides with the monsoon season. However, Spence et al. (2006) argue
that zebrafish breed all year round, an assertion supported by finding females with mature
eggs even in January.
The food preference of zebrafish in nature has also been documented (McClure,
McIntyre, and McCune, 2006). The mouth of the zebrafish opens upward, which suggests
that this fish catches its food items from below. Usually, this anatomy is found in fish that
feed from the surface of the water. The gut of zebrafish has been found to contain mainly
insects, but crustaceans, fish scales, algae, and detritus were also identified. Analysis of the
insects revealed that their origin was primarily terrestrial and not aquatic (McClure et al.,
2006), suggesting that the dominant mode of foraging for zebrafish indeed involves
catching insects that fall into the water.
Shoaling behavior of zebrafish has been reported (Engeszer et al., 2007; McClure et
al., 2006; Spence et al., 2006) in nature, but quantitative analysis of shoal size or shoal
composition has not been performed (Miller and Gerlai, 2011). Nevertheless, given that
zebrafish coinhabits its habitat with other Danio species of similar size and body shape as
zebrafish, it is possible that zebrafish forms mixed-species shoals, a speculation that is
supported by the results of empirical laboratory studies (Saverino and Gerlai, 2008).
Zebrafish in the Laboratory: Inducing Fear Responses with Olfactory Cues
Numerous fish species have been found to respond to their alarm substance, an
olfactory cue that is released from epidermal club cells when the fish's skin is damaged
(e.g., for earlier reviews, see Pfeiffer, 1962; Solomon, 1977; for more recent discoveries,
see Brown, Adrian, Lewis, and Tower, 2002 and references therein; Brown, Adrian, and
Shih, 2001; Brown, Adrian, Smyth, Leet, and Brennan, 2000). The zebrafish is no
exception. It has also been found to show significant alarm reactions to its natural alarm
substance (Hall and Suboski, 1995; Waldman, 1982). We have studied the effect of this
substance too, which may be extracted by cutting the skin of freshly euthanized fish and
washing the cuts to collect the substance (Speedie and Gerlai, 2008). Zebrafish respond to
the presence of this substance with a variety of behaviors, including erratic movement, a
typical zig-zag motion with rapidly changing and short bouts of linear and angular
acceleration and deceleration episodes (Speedie and Gerlai, 2008). Although this behavior
has not been observed in nature, in the test aquarium it usually occurs near or on the bottom
of the tank and thus its function has been hypothesized to be the generation of turbulence
and with it the stirring up of debris in waters with sediment rich substrates (Speedie and
Gerlai, 2008). This speculation is supported by the observation that erratic movement is
almost always followed by complete cessation of movement (i.e., immobility). Motionless
prey under a cloud of debris may be hard for predators to detect (Speedie and Gerlai, 2008).
In addition to this behavior, the alarm substance was also found to induce changes in
shoaling (increased shoal cohesion) as well as increased bottom dwell time (Speedie and
Gerlai, 2008). However, the issue with the alarm substance has been that fresh extraction
does not allow one to ascertain the precise concentration of the active ingredient, at least
not across multiple experiments (within a particular experiment one can create a dilution
Zebrafish fear
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -595-
sequence and thus control at least the relative dose). Thus, even if the extraction protocol is
precisely followed, between-study error rate is expected to be high.
This issue was addressed by Parra, Adrian, and Gerlai (2009) who utilized a
recently developed synthetic alarm substance, Hypoxanthine-3-N-oxide or H3NO (see e.g.,
Brown et al., 2001), and showed that this substance is also capable of producing strong fear
responses. Notably, the synthetic alarm substance has been found to induce alarm reactions
in multiple species of fish (Brown et al., 2001; Brown, Adrian, Nabil, Mark, and Jocelyn,
2003; but also see Mathuru et al., 2012; Smith, 1999). Whether the synthetic substance
induced alarm reactions are identical in severity and/or qualitative aspects to those induced
by the natural alarm substance is controversial at this point. In our own studies (Speedie
and Gerlai, 2008), we found the natural alarm substance to increase bottom dwell time,
with the strongest response elicited by an intermediate dose (i.e., we obtained an inverted U
shaped dose response curve) in zebrafish. Waldman (1982) also reported that zebrafish
move close to the substrate of the tank in response to the skin extract he used. Furthermore,
we found the distance between shoal members to decrease after the administration of the
natural alarm substance, and the frequency and the duration of erratic movement episodes
to increase in a linear dose-dependent manner (Speedie and Gerlai, 2008). H3NO, the
synthetic alarm substance, also induced increased erratic movement as well as elevated the
frequency of single jumps (also called leaping, dashing, or darting in other publications) in
zebrafish (Parra et al., 2009). But interestingly, H3NO did not increase bottom dwell time.
In line with this finding, Mathuru et al. (2012) also found H3NO not to induce the full fear
repertoire of effects elicited by the skin extract of zebrafish. In this latter paper, the authors
not only performed a detailed analysis of the behavioral effects of skin extract but also
investigated the different components of the extract as to their potential identity and
phenotypical effects. They found that chondroitin, a glycosaminoglycan purified from the
zebrafish skin extract, induced significant fear responses in zebrafish (Mathuru et al.,
2012). It is also notable that there may be several other reasons why the effects of synthetic
and natural (skin extracted) alarm substances may differ. There are numerous
methodological differences among the cited studies and there may also be significant
population or strain differences among the zebrafish used in these papers. Also,
importantly, and as mentioned before, the exact dose of the skin extract is most often
unknown. Thus, although a within-experiment dilution sequence may give one the ability to
conduct a dose response analysis, such an analysis is useless across experiments unless the
exact identity and concentration of the active ingredients of the skin extract solution are
identified. This is particularly problematic if one considers the found inverse U-shaped
dose response profile of the skin extract.
Although not without controversies, H3NO and most recently chondroitin have
been identified as important alarm substances that induce robust alarm reactions in
zebrafish (Brown et al., 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003; Mathuru et al., 2012). It has been argued
that a range of species may respond to the same alarm substances. This lack of species-
specificity is not surprising. It is likely that natural selection has favored those individuals
that were not highly selective and responded to alarm substances of multiple prey species
(Parra et al., 2009). After all, the ability of the prey to sense the presence of a dangerous
predator should not depend upon what prey species the predator has just captured.

The Sight of Predators as Fear Inducing Stimuli
A common problem with all of the alarm substance studies has been that olfactory
cues are highly difficult to work with. The onset and offset (particularly the latter) of their
administration is difficult to control precisely and may require labor-intensive and time-
consuming water changes and thorough cleaning of the experimental tank. Some olfactory
cues, including the synthetic alarm substance H3NO, may not be very stable, may decay
over time and lose their potency if not stored or handled properly (personal observation),
and may also loose efficacy depending on water chemistry, particularly pH (Brown et al.,
2002). For these reasons, we have decided to explore alternative ways of inducing fear in
zebrafish. Zebrafish is a diurnal species which has excellent vision. The zebrafish visual
system is tetrachromatic (e.g., Connaughton and Nelson, 2010). This fish has four different
cones that are sensitive to particular wave-lengths of light. Zebrafish may use it to detect
the presence of mates, competitors, food items, as well as predators. Indeed, we have been
able to induce robust fear responses by exposing zebrafish to live predatory fish (Bass and
Gerlai, 2008). Zebrafish responded strongly irrespective of whether the predator was in the
same tank as the test subject or if it was outside of it, as long as the test subject could see
the predator (Bass and Gerlai, 2008). The responses of zebrafish included moving away
from the location where the predator was shown, as well as increased number of erratic
movement episodes and leaping (a single acceleration bout achieved by the use of the
caudal fin). In addition, zebrafish also distinguished predatory and harmless fish species as
they responded with increased shoal cohesion (smaller inter-individual distance within the
shoal) only to predatory, but not to harmless, fish species shown.
An interesting aspect of these findings was that the two predatory species used (the
Indian leaf fish, Nandus nandus and the Compressed African cichlid, Dimidochromis
compressiceps) induced different behavioral responses (Bass and Gerlai, 2008).
Presentation of the leaf fish led to increased erratic movement and leaping frequency,
whereas the African cichlid was mainly ineffective. This difference was observed despite
the fact that the African cichlid performed a significantly higher frequency of predatory
attacks. Given that the experimental zebrafish used in these studies were bred and raised in
the laboratory and had never been exposed to predators of any kind, we concluded that
zebrafish possess genetic predispositions that allow them to respond to aversive cues
without any prior exposure to such cues. That is, the possibility of zebrafish being able to
innately recognize its natural (sympatric) predator was raised (Bass and Gerlai, 2008).
Most recently, however, this notion was put under scrutiny (Ahmed, Fernandes, and
Gerlai, 2012). The issue with the previous study that demonstrated the differential effect of
the sympatric leaf fish vs. the allopatric compressed cichlid was that only one sympatric
and one allopatric predator was compared; i.e., the results may have been idiosyncratic to
the pair of predatory stimulus fish used. It is possible that other sympatric predators may
not induce strong antipredatory reactions or, alternatively, allopatric predators other than
the compressed cichlid do. We have started to address this question by exposing zebrafish
to animated images of a series of sympatric predators (Ahmed, Fernandes, and Gerlai,
2012).
Our results partially confirmed that zebrafish are capable of responding to fear
Zebrafish fear
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -597-
inducing stimuli without any prior exposure to such stimuli. But the answer to the question
of whether zebrafish are able to recognize their natural (sympatric) predators was further
complicated by our results. This is what we found: Four sympatric predator species, the
Indian leaf fish (Nandus nandus), the blotched snakehead fish (Channa maculata), a catfish
(Mystus bleekeri), and the clown knife fish Chitala chitala) were found to be highly
effective. In fact, the knife fish and the catfish appeared even more effective in inducing the
fear responses than the leaf fish was. Interestingly, the fifth predator, the freshwater needle
fish (Xenentodon cancila), whose image we used, did not induce the expected fear
responses and in fact, instead of an avoidance reaction, it elicited approach from zebrafish.
This was quite surprising to us as this predator species has been repeatedly identified as one
that inhabits the same waters as zebrafish, and it is also known to be a dedicated piscivore
(Engeszer et al., 2007; Spence et al., 2006). Also notably, the size of the image of the
needle fish we used was large enough for a live individual to be able to capture and eat a
fully grown adult zebrafish. Furthermore, in another independent study, we also found the
needle fish to be ineffective in inducing fear reactions in zebrafish (Luca and Gerlai, 2011).
We speculated that perhaps the manner in which the image of the needle fish was presented
did not mimic the natural behavior of this predator and that may have been the reason why
zebrafish explored this stimulus rather than avoiding it. For example, we utilized a standard
presentation method that included making the image of the given predator move with a set
speed of 0.3 cm/sec. Also, the images moved across the entire surface area of the side wall
of the test tank; i.e., they were not localized to any particular layer of the tank. The
advantage of this computer animation was that it allowed us to present the stimuli in a
consistent manner across all types of stimuli and sessions. The disadvantage may have
been, however, that particular predators may exhibit different motor patterns or may
occupy different layers in the water column in nature. For example, while the knife fish,
leaf fish, and the snakehead fish are ambush predators and are expected to stay in position
or move only slowly until the predatory strike, the needle fish is a fast moving and actively
hunting predator (Gerlai, personal observation; also see Foster, 1973). Also, the knife fish
and the leaf fish tend to be either on the bottom or the mid layers of the water column
whereas the needlefish is usually found near the water surface. In summary, it is likely that
the needlefish was presented in an artificial manner that did not recapitulate the natural
behavior of this piscivore.
This latter speculation brings up an important point. We know practically nothing
about what makes a predator a predator for zebrafish. We do not know what stimuli
zebrafish may be sensitive to and how certain stimuli define danger for zebrafish. Such
stimuli may include the color and pattern, the size and body proportions, and/or the motor
patterns of the stimulus fish or any combination of such features. In fact, it is possible that
zebrafish may not need to be presented with a realistic image of a sympatric predator in
order to respond to the stimulus with a full-fledged fear reaction, a possibility that is now
supported by empirical findings (Ahmed, Fernandes, and Gerlai, 2012).
In this latter study, zebrafish were presented with abstract shapes in a manner
identical to how the images of sympatric predators were shown. Interestingly, one of the
shapes, a rectangle whose speed of movement, size, "body proportions" (12 x 3.8 cm,
length x height) and color (light greenish brown) were similar to corresponding features of
Zebrafish fear
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -598-
the presented predator images, induced fear responses that were statistically
indistinguishable from those induced by the most effective sympatric predator images (e.g.,
that of the knife fish, catfish, snakehead fish, and leaf fish). That is, although similar in
some characteristics to the images, the otherwise featureless (no pattern, no eyes, no mouth,
no fins) "predator," the slowly moving greenish-brown rectangle, was just as effective as
the images of real piscivores. Based on this finding, one could argue that any object of a
certain size moving in a certain speed may induce the fear responses in zebrafish. However,
we have evidence that this is not true (Ahmed, Fernandes, and Gerlai, 2012). Another
geometric shape (a flattened star), whose size, speed, color, and overall proportions were
all identical to those of the rectangle, was completely ineffective as it induced no fear
reactions in zebrafish (Ahmed, Fernandes, and Gerlai, 2012). In summary, the above
findings clearly demonstrate our lack of understanding of what stimuli and in what
combination define a predator for zebrafish. Systematic dissection of features of predators
will need to be conducted. These studies are now quite feasible with the use of computer
animation software. It is clear, however, that realistic images of sympatric predators are not
necessary for the induction of fear responses in zebrafish.
This notion is also supported by another study in which we presented computer
animated objects, including an expanding dot and the silhouette of a bird of prey, to
zebrafish and measured the fear reactions of the experimental zebrafish (Luca and Gerlai,
2011). The main goal of this study was to explore whether the location of presentation of
these stimuli matters and whether the fear responses are uniform or idiosyncratic to the
context in which they are induced. The results indicated that the expanding dot induced a
strong fear response, especially when presented from above. We speculated that this
stimulus may resemble a rapidly approaching aerial predator (birds pull their wings close to
their body when striking with a dive from above and thus may appear cylindrical when
viewed head-on). Importantly, the very same stimulus (expanding dot) when presented on
the side induced much less robust reactions as compared to when it was shown from above,
but it still did lead to avoidance of the location of the stimulus (Luca and Gerlai, 2011).
Surprisingly, the bird silhouette was effective both when shown from above and from the
side (Luca and Gerlai, 2011). It led to significant reduction of distance swum and increased
the number of erratic movement episodes. But in other behaviors the side versus top
presentation of this stimulus induced different responses. When shown on the side the bird
silhouette increased the number of leaps (called jumps in that paper), but such change was
not observed when the stimulus was shown from the top. The percent of time the fish
remained completely immobile was affected the opposite way by the different location of
stimulus presentation. When shown from the top the bird silhouette increased immobility,
but when shown from the side it decreased it. Similarly, when shown from the top the
stimulus increased bottom dwell time, but when shown from the side it decreased it.
Taken together, these findings and the ones obtained in a series of experiments with
different predator images and other abstract shapes suggest that zebrafish have a complex
antipredatory repertoire, and how this species responds to a particular aversive stimulus is
dependent upon both the type and the location of the stimulus. It is thus likely that one
needs to measure a range of behaviors to capture the changes in fear response induced by,
for example, a mutation, a novel drug, or the particular aversive stimulus employed. This
Zebrafish fear
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -599-
brings us to the next question: How can one quantify these responses and detect changes in
fear-related reactions?
Quantification of Fear Responses
Quantification of behavior in general is a whole scientific field to itself (Martin and
Bateson, 1993; also see Gerlai, 2002). Here, I will focus on two principally different
methods: observation based and video-tracking based applications as they pertain to the
analysis of zebrafish behavior (Blaser and Gerlai, 2006). Each has its own merits and
disadvantages. Observation-based behavioral quantification is time-consuming and labor-
intensive (e.g., Gerlai, Crusio, and Csányi, 1990). The observer needs to view the animals
performing in the task and needs to identify the behaviors, record the amount of time for
which the behavior occurred, and/or record the number of occurrences of the behavior. The
advantage of this approach is that even with sophisticated computer technologies of the 21st
century, the human brain is still perhaps the best pattern detection device and thus
observation-based approaches allow the experimenter to quantify often rather complex
motor and posture patterns that would escape detection by automated techniques such as
video-tracking (Gerlai, 2002). In the case of fear, one of the most typical responses to a
variety of fear-inducing stimuli has been erratic movement or zig-zagging (e.g., Gerlai,
1993; Gerlai, Lahav, Guo, and Rosenthal, 2000; Bass and Gerlai, 2008). This characteristic
fear reaction is difficult to capture with video-tracking (but see Gerlai, Fernandes, and
Pereira, 2009). Another behavior that is similarly problematic to quantify using video-
tracking is leaping (or jumping). It is also notable that in response to novel treatments
(drugs, induced mutations, or other new experimental manipulations) one may see
unexpected or previously undescribed motor and posture patterns that would remain
undetectable if one used traditional video-tracking parameters (see below). Thus, it is
recommended that analysis of the effects of such novel treatments start with observation-
based methods (e.g., Gerlai and Clayton, 1999). It is also notable that, unlike common
wisdom, observation-based quantification methods do have high inter- and intra-rater
reproducibility, and if the studies are conducted blind and experimental design includes
proper randomization, then experimenter bias is also not a problem. Furthermore,
nowadays the experimenter using observation-based methods does not have to rely on
his/her stopwatch. These approaches move beyond the old-fashioned paper-pencil method
and now employ sophisticated software aids, applications that turn the computer into a
practically limitless number of stopwatches that can allow one to measure both mutually
exclusive and overlapping behaviors of multiple subjects (players) at the same time.
The alternative to observation-based methods is, for example, the automated
computerized video-tracking, which has also been successfully employed in the analysis of
zebrafish behavior (Blaser and Gerlai, 2006). This method allows one to record the xy (or
in more advanced cases the xyz 3D) coordinates of the location of the target subject(s) in
high temporal resolution (e.g., 10-40 video-frames per second). From these coordinates,
one can extract a large number of important behavioral measures, including exact location
of the fish, the distance of the fish from a predetermined area, line or point, total distance
moved, speed, turn angle, and several other characteristics of the movement (swim) path of
Zebrafish fear

the subject. The main advantage of this approach is that it is highly quantitative. A human
observer may be able to distinguish fast swim speed from slow, but he/she will definitely
not be able to precisely measure how much or how fast the subject was moving. Similarly,
although one can record how much time the test subject spent in the bottom third of the
tank, for example, the exact distance from the bottom can only be quantified using the
video-tracking software. This is an important drawback of observation-based methods, as
quantitative (e.g., exact distance measures) variables tend to offer better statistical power
and less error variation compared to discrete variables (e.g., variables that depend upon
thresholds or categories). Another major advantage of video-tracking is that it does not
require the presence of the observer. One can video-tape the behavioral sessions of multiple
subjects in a large number of experimental set-ups and quantify the behavioral responses in
parallel. The ability to scale up behavioral research this way allows the experimenter to
utilize video-tracking in high throughput screening applications, the major promise of
zebrafish research (Gerlai, 2010a and references therein; Grunwald and Eisen, 2003). It
may even be possible to capture some aspects of complex motor patterns using video-
tracking. For example, we have found that erratic movement significantly correlates with
within-individual temporal variance of speed (because erratic movement is associated with
episodes of very fast and very slow swim bouts) as well as turn angle (because this
behavior is associated with a series of quick direction changes), and with the within-
individual temporal variance of turn angle (Gerlai et al., 2009), parameters that standard
video-tracking software applications routinely extract. Furthermore, one can easily see how
combining certain classical video-tracking parameters and setting up certain filters (criteria)
may allow one to define more complex behavioral variables. For example, leaping
(jumping) may be defined by swim speed reaching a minimum threshold (e.g., 5 cm/sec)
and at the same time bout length not exceeding an upper limit (e.g., 2 sec). In summary,
although observation-based methods are recommended at the early discovery/development
phase of the research study, video-tracking applications may provide sufficient
sophistication and are crucial in later, high-throughput phases of fear research. Last, it is
also recommended that once an interesting effect (or a mutation or a compound) is
identified as having fear altering aspects, one can (and should) go back and observe the
behavior of the subject to make sure the automated method is correct and did not miss some
important changes.
Analysis of Fear Responses in Larval or Developing Zebrafish
In this review I deliberately focused on studies conducted in my own laboratory.
These studies have been developed for the analysis of the behavior of adult zebrafish.
Focusing on the adults, I believe, is important because at this developmental stage one does
not expect robust age-dependent (i.e., ontogenetic) changes for several months of the
subjects' lives. That is, after reaching sexual maturity at the age of 3 months, zebrafish
remain healthy and reproductively active until about 3 years of age without showing clear
signs of aging. This stable period allows one to study time-dependent effects of many
manipulations, including repeated environmental stimulus exposure-induced effects or drug
or chemical exposure episodes. Such repeated exposure/stimulation effects would be
Zebrafish fear

difficult to disentangle in the rapidly developing embryo or larval fish. Nevertheless,
analysis of embryonic development or the larval stage of zebrafish has been the focus of
the majority of studies conducted with this species. The behavioral characterization of the
larval zebrafish is also important. Specifically, fear responses in the larval zebrafish have
been analyzed. Here I only mention a couple of examples for such analyses. Bianco,
Kampff, and Engert (2011) analyzed the effect of moving objects (a circular spot presented
on a screen using an LCD projector) on 6-7 post-fertilization day old zebrafish (freely
swimming stage starts at 5 days post-fertilization). These authors found that when the spot
was small, it elicited a prey capture-like response, orientation with the body, and fixation
(eye convergence) by the eyes, but when the stimulus was large it induced a significant
avoidance reaction. Richendrfer, Pelkowski, Colwill, and Creton (2012) recently published
a paper in which a simple and cheap larval zebrafish apparatus and assay for the analysis of
fear responses is described. In this paradigm the zebrafish (again, only a few day old freely
moving larval zebrafish) are presented with large moving circular objects on a computer
screen placed underneath the arenas (wells) in which the subject(s) is/are swimming. The
authors showed a significant avoidance reaction induced by the "bouncing ball" and argued
that their paradigm allows high throughput screening of anxiolytic and anxiogenic
compounds at this early developmental stage, an important development in the field given
the short time required for the generation of hundreds of larval zebrafish.
Concluding Remarks
From a translational perspective, zebrafish may be important in the analysis of fear
for two main reasons. First, as a practically more feasible study species it may allow one to
discover important genetic and other biological mechanisms associated with fear faster and
with better efficiency than one could achieve with other laboratory vertebrates or with our
own species. Given the evolutionary conservation found at several levels of the biological
organization between this fish and humans (from nucleotide sequence, homologies between
genes of the two species, physiological and anatomical similarities of these species, to
functional similarities of their brains, and the behavioral manifestation of these functions),
one can be hopeful that the zebrafish will offer good translational relevance. Second, even
if the zebrafish may not always be superior from a research perspective as compared to
other model organisms, its analysis adds important knowledge as to how the vertebrate
brain functions. Information about mechanisms underlying complex behaviors, such as fear
responses, obtained from multiple species allows one to compare the results. Such a
comparative approach may allow one to find common features among the studied
organisms. It is these commonalities that should truly allow good translation to humans, as
it is likely that they represent perhaps the most important evolutionarily conserved features.
Finding such features, I believe, may be best achieved if one keeps the species-specific
characteristics of the study organism in mind; i.e., if one considers information about the
natural history and ecology of the study species in the design of experiments and in the
interpretation of their results.
In this review I mainly focused on our own efforts and discussed some points about
the behavioral analysis of fear responses in zebrafish. Clearly, our studies demonstrate that
Zebrafish fear

much needs to be done before one can really understand how to induce and measure fear
reactions in this novel study species. Nevertheless, we, together with many other
researchers (e.g., Blaser, Chadwick, and McGinnis, 2010; Colwill and Creton, 2011;
Jesuthasan, 2012; Jesuthasan and Mathuru, 2008; Maximino et al., 2010; Okamoto,
Agetsuma, and Aizawa, 2012; Stensmyr and Maderspacher, 2012), have already collected
enough evidence that demonstrates that zebrafish will be an important tool with which the
mechanisms of vertebrate fear is studied.
