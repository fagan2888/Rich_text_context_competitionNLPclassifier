OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that an elevated ratio of subscapular to triceps skinfold thickness (SFR), a measure of truncal
obesity, is associated with increased incidence of stroke independent of overweight.
DESIGN: Data from the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study were analyzed.
SUBJECTS: A cohort of 3652 women and 3284 men with complete data who had no history of stroke at baseline in 1971 ± 1975.
MEASUREMENTS: Incidence of stroke diagnosed at hospital discharge or death during the follow-up period through 1992;
triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness (SSF) and body mass index (BMI) at baseline.
RESULTS: In a complex relationship, higher SFR was associated with a mildly but signi®cantly increased incidence of stroke only
in white male former smokers. In white men, SSF showed a U-shaped association with stroke risk. In white men, stroke risk was
elevated in the top quartile of BMI only in never smokers. In black women, stroke risk was signi®cantly elevated in the bottom
compared to the top quartile of BMI. No signi®cant associations were seen in white women or black men.
CONCLUSIONS: In white men, SSF showed a U-shaped association with stroke risk, which was elevated in the top quartile of
BMI only in never smokers. Surprisingly, stroke risk was elevated in black women with the lowest BMI. More studies of these
associations are needed, especially in black women.

Introduction
Overweight and obesity are the second leading cause of
preventable death in the United States, affecting an esti-
mated 97 million adults.1 The presence of excess fat in the
trunk or abdomen out of proportion to total body fat is an
independent predictor of risk factors and morbidity.1 ± 4 Rela-
tively few studies have attempted to examine body fat
distribution as a risk factor for incidence of stroke, especially
in women and blacks.5,6 In cohorts of white women aged
55 ± 69 y and white men aged 40 ± 75, increased self-mea-
sured waist-to-hip ratio increased the risk of self-reported
stroke over a 2-y or 5-y follow-up.5,6 In both studies, the
association of central obesity with stroke risk was indepen-
dent of body mass index (BMI). In order to replicate these
®ndings and to examine variation in the association by sex
and race and other possible effect modi®ers, data from a
longitudinal follow-up study of a national sample were
analyzed to test the hypotheses: (1) that persons whose
ratio of subscapular to triceps skinfolds was in the highest
quartile were at increased risk for development of stroke over
the follow-up period compared to persons in the lowest
quartile independent of baseline BMI; (2) that those with
elevated subscapular skinfold thickness were at increased risk
for stroke; (3) that those with increased BMI were at
increased risk for stroke; and (4) that these associations
were modi®ed by sex, race, BMI level or smoking status.

and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) who were
25 ± 74 y of age at the time of the survey examination in
1971 ± 1975.7 ± 11 The personal interviews, physical and
laboratory examinations of NHANES I provided the baseline
data for the NHEFS. This analysis was based on four waves of
follow-up data collected during 1982 ± 1984, 1986, 1987 and
1992. Data collected consisted of interviews, health care
facility medical records for the period between baseline and
last follow-up, and death certi®cates for all decendents.
Information about place and date of hospitalizations was
obtained from the follow-up interviews andaor death certi-
®cates. The completeness of data collection has been
reported.11,12
This analysis included white and black persons 45 ± 74 y of
age at baseline examined at locations 1 ± 100 in NHANES I.
Of the 7895 white and black persons 45 ± 74 y of age at
baseline, 188 (2.4%) were lost to follow-up (ie had no
follow-up interview or death certi®cate). Excluded from the
analyses were 510 persons with unknown baseline subscap-
ular or triceps skinfold thickness, height, weight, physical
activity history, systolic blood pressure, history of recent
blood pressure medication, serum cholesterol, diabetes his-
tory, smoking status, alcohol drinking history, hemoglobin
concentration, history of heart disease or educational attain-
ment. Additionally, 261 persons were excluded who had a
positive history of stroke at baseline, de®ned as those who
had ever been told by a doctor that they had had a stroke
prior to the baseline interview. After all exclusions, 6936
persons remained for the analyses (5961 white persons and
975 black persons), as shown in Table 1. The mean length of
follow-up for stroke-free survivors was 19 y.
Outcome de®nitions
Incident stroke cases met at least one of the following
criteria: (1) a death certi®cate with underlying or non-under-
lying cause of death coded 431 ± 434.9, 436, 437.0 ± 437.1
using the International Classi®cation of Diseases Nineth
Revision (ICD-9); or (2) one or more hospital andaor nursing
home stays during the follow-up period with any discharge
diagnosis with the following codes using the Clinical Mod-
i®cation (CM) of ICD-9: 431, 434, 436. The date of incidence
was estimated as one of the following: (1) date of ®rst
hospital admission with a stroke diagnosis; or (2) date of
death for stroke deaths without any stroke hospital records.
The subgroup nonhemorrhagic stroke was de®ned by the
underlying or non-underlying cause of death ICD-9 433 ±
434.9, 436, 437.0 ± 437.1 without associated 431 ± 432.9
codes or hospital discharge diagnosis ICD-9 CM 434 or 436
without associated 431. The number of cases of hemorrhagic
stroke (excluding subarachnoid hemorrhage) ICD-9 431 ±
432.9 (deaths) or ICD-9 CM 431 (hospitalizations) was too
small for meaningful analysis within sex or race groups.
Table 1 shows the number of incident cases of stroke in the
analysis cohort by age, sex and race.
Baseline variables
During the baseline physical examination in a mobile exam-
ination center, trained technicians measured skinfolds on
the right side of the body using a Lange skinfold caliper.13
The subscapular skinfold (SSF), a measure of truncal and
overall obesity, was measured at the inferior angle of the
scapula. The triceps skinfold was measured posteriorly at the
halfway point between the outer edge of the acromion
process and the olecranon process of the ulna. Technicians
also measured height and weight.13 The ratio of subscapular
to triceps skinfold thickness (SFR) was used as an indicator
of truncal vs peripheral distribution of body fat.6

Obesity, overweight and stroke

Unfortunately, neither waist nor hip girth were measured in
NHANES I. BMI, (kgam2) was computed from baseline weight
and height. Sex ± race ± speci®c approximate quartiles of each
variable were de®ned using cutpoints shown in the Appen-
dix.
The baseline medical history questionnaire provided
information about selected conditions (for example diabetes)
diagnosed by a doctor.7,9 A positive history of heart disease at
baseline was de®ned as having ever been told by a doctor
that one had ever had a heart attack or heart failure or
having used any medicine, drugs or pills for a weak heart
during the six months prior to the baseline interview. At the
beginning of the baseline physical examination, the physi-
cian measured blood pressure with the examinee seated.14
Other baseline variables were measured as described else-
where.7 ± 9,13 ± 16
Statistical methods
Stroke incidence rates were calculated as the number of
incident cases per 1000 person-years of follow-up at ages
45 ± 64 and 65 ± 74. Estimates of the risk of stroke incidence
for persons with higher quartiles of SFR, SSF or BMI relative
to those with in the lowest quartile derive from Cox propor-
tional hazards regression models computed using the PHREG
procedure in the Statistical Analysis System (SAS).17 Persons
who did not develop stroke were censored at either the date
of their last follow-up interview or their date of death. Tests
of the signi®cance of trends across quartiles of these variables
were conducted by treating the four quartiles as ordered
categories.
Control variables in regression models were selected based
on the literature to identify potential confounders and also
mediators of hypothesized effects of SFR, SSF and BMI on
stroke risk. In preliminary analyses BMI2 in addition to BMI
seemed appropriate for inclusion in some subgroups in SFR
and SSF models and was included in all such models for
consistency. All SSF models included age at baseline in single
years and BMI and BMI2 as covariates. All SSF and BMI
models included age at baseline in single years as a covariate.
Risk-adjusted models included current cigarette smoking
(yes, no), alcohol consumption in the past year (yes, no),
educational attainment (` 12 y, ! 12 y), hemoglobin con-
centration (gadl), hemoglobin concentration squared, his-
tory of heart disease (yes, no), and nonrecreational physical
activity level (low, medium, high). Risk- and mediator-
adjusted models included the preceding variables plus sys-
tolic blood pressure (mmHg), history of current blood pres-
sure medication, serum cholesterol (mgadl), and history of
diabetes (yes, no). Separate models were developed for white
men, white women, black men and black women.
To assess the effect of the complex survey design on the
results, Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were
performed using PROC SURVIVAL in SUDAAN to incorporate
the sample weights and the strati®cation and clustering in
the analysis.18,19 The results were consistent with minimal
effects of the complex survey design on the main conclu-
sions derived from the unweighted estimates. Therefore the
estimates from the unweighted Cox regression models are
presented.
Results
Body fat distribution (SFR)
Incidence rates of stroke per 1000 person-years are shown in
(Table 1). At ages 45 ± 74, Kaplan-Meier survival curves failed
to show signi®cant differences among quartiles (not shown).
In Cox regression analyses controlling for age, BMI and
BMI2 risk of stroke was not signi®cantly associated with
quartile of SFR in black men or in black or white women
aged 45 ± 74 (Table 2). The lack of association persisted after
controlling for multiple confounders. Results were
unchanged after controlling for the mediating variables
systolic blood pressure, blood pressure medication use, his-
tory of diabetes and serum total cholesterol concentration
(Table 2). For nonhemorrhagic stroke, no signi®cant associa-
tions were seen. Interactions of SFR with age, BMI and
smoking were nonsigni®cant in blacks or white women.
In white men the results were complex and somewhat
inconsistent. In all white men aged 45 ± 74, relative risk of all
stroke was signi®cantly elevated in the fourth quartile of SFR
(Table 2). However, for all stroke (P  0.003) and nonhemor-
rhagic stroke (P  0.005), signi®cant interactions of SFR and
BMI were observed in regression models with SFR and BMI
entered as continuous variables with an interaction term.
The negative coef®cient of the interaction terms indicated
that the effect of SFR was less at higher levels of BMI.
Furthermore, regression models indicated interactions of
SFR with smoking as well as BMI. Only in white male
former smokers (but not in never or current smokers), was
stroke risk signi®cantly elevated in the fourth SFR quartile
(all stroke age-adjusted RR  2.26, 95% CI 1.25 ± 4.09, risk-
adjusted RR  2.53, 95% CI 1.38 ± 4.65). Because of a signi®-
cant SFRÂBMI interaction (P  0.02), this analysis was
repeated in former smokers above and below the median
BMI. A signi®cant positive association of SFR and stroke risk
was observed in former smokers with BMI above the median.
A nonsigni®cantly increased risk was also seen in the fourth
quartile of those with low BMI. The direction of the
SFRÂBMI interaction in former smokers was the reverse
of that in all white men. Because of this inconsistency and
the necessary use of imputed smoking data for about half
the sample, no ®rm conclusions can be drawn about the
association of SFR and stroke in white men.
Truncal obesity (SSF)
Figure 1 shows the incidence rate of stroke per 1000 person-
years of follow-up in whites by age, sex and quartile of SSF,
and indicator of obesity. In white men aged 65 ± 74, the
incidence rate of stroke was highest among those with
high SSF, and lowest among those in the second quartile

(Figure 1). In white women, no consistent pattern was seen
for SSF. A trend towards an inverse association of SSF with
incidence rates was seen in blacks.
In white men, Cox regression models con®rmed a U-
shaped relationship of SSF with stroke risk with the lowest
risk in the second quartile. When SSF was entered in models
which controlled for age, BMI and BMI2, a U-shaped pattern
persisted in white men (Table 3), essentially the same as that
shown for SSF, not controlling for BMI (Figure 1). For non-
hemorrhagic stroke in white men, the U-shaped pattern
with lowest risk in the second quartile of SSF was also seen
(Table 3). In black women aged 65 ± 74, stroke risk was
highest in the ®rst quartile of SSF (Figure 1). Signi®cant
associations of SSF with stroke risk were no longer present
after controlling for BMI and BMI2 in sex, race groups except
white men (Table 3). Signi®cant associations of SSF with
stroke risk were not observed in white women or black men
in any models.
Since previous reports have indicated effect modi®cation
by smoking with effects of obesity restricted to nonsmokers,
regression models were done in white men within smoking
categories (not shown). In white men, a nonsigni®cant U-
shaped relationship of SSF and stroke risk was seen in current
smokers, nonsmokers (former and never) and never smokers.
No effect modi®cation by smoking was seen in white women
or in blacks.

Overweight (BMI)
Figure 2 shows the incidence rate of stroke per 1000 person-
years of follow-up in whites by age, sex and quartile of BMI,
an indicator of overweight. In white men aged 65 ± 74, a
direct association with stroke incidence was seen for BMI
(Figure 2). In white women, no consistent pattern was seen
for BMI. A trend towards an inverse association of BMI with
incidence rates was seen in blacks.
Since previous reports in white men have indicated effect
modi®cation by smoking with effects of overweight
restricted to nonsmokers, regression models were done in
white men within smoking categories (Table 4). In white
male never smokers, risk was signi®cantly elevated in the
fourth compared to ®rst BMI quartile (Table 4). In current
smokers, former smokers or in ever smokers (former and
current), no signi®cant association was seen (Table 4). A
similar pattern was seen for nonhemorrhagic stroke. Thus
in white men, smoking modi®ed the effect of BMI on stroke
risk, with the effect of elevated BMI restricted to never
smokers. No effect modi®cation by smoking was seen in
white women or in blacks.
In black women, the highest risk of stroke occurred in the
lowest quartile of BMI (P  0.02 for BMI ` 24.1 vs b 32.3
controlling for age or multiple confounders). Relative risk
(RR) was similar in the second through fourth strata (Table
4). No signi®cant associations were seen in white women or
black men. No signi®cant associations of BMI and nonhe-
morrhagic stroke risk were seen for any group except black
women, in whom the pattern was essentially the same as for
all stroke in age and confounder-adjusted models shown in
Table 4.
Height
In white women aged 45 ± 74, risk of all stroke or nonhemor-
rhagic stroke was signi®cantly reduced in the second and
fourth quartiles of height compared to the ®rst quartile after
controlling for age, BMI, and BMI2 or for multiple confoun-
ders. However risk in the third quartile was similar to that in
the ®rst. No signi®cant associations were seen in other
groups, except a signi®cantly increased risk of all stroke in
the fourth quartile in black men.

Discussion
This paper reports one of the few longitudinal studies of
central obesity and the subsequent development of stroke
controlling for baseline BMI. It provides the ®rst data for
blacks, who suffer disproportionately from stroke. Data
from NHEFS showed a complex relationship among
stroke risk, SFR, BMI, smoking, sex and race. SFR was
not a signi®cant predictor of stroke risk in white women
or in black men or women. Higher SFR was associated
with a mildly increased incidence of stroke in white male
former smokers, especially those with high BMI. Reasons
why this association seemed limited to white male former
smokers are unknown but may include gender and racial
differences in pathophysiology and etiology of cerebral
infarction (ie extracranial vs intracranial atherosclerosis,
large vs small vessel or lacunar infarction, indistinguish-
able in this study), effects of smoking on weight and fat
distribution, bias due to use of imputed smoking data in
half the cohort, andaor to chance (wide con®dence limits
for former smokers). In white men, a U-shaped association
of SSF and a direct association of BMI with stroke risk was
seen. In black women, stroke risk was elevated in the top
quartile of SFR, but in the bottom quartiles of SSF and
BMI. Effect modi®cation of the positive association of
stroke risk with BMI level by smoking status was observed
in white men, effects being greatest in never smokers. No
signi®cant associations were seen in white women or
black men.

Obesity, overweight and stroke
RF Gillum et al

International Journal of Obesity
Mechanisms have been suggested for an association of
truncal and abdominal obesity with the incidence of
ischemic stroke.5,6 Elevated SFR might be a marker for a
state characterized by increased truncal and visceral fat
leading to insulin resistance and increased plasma insulin
levels with resulting dyslipidemia, glucose intolerancea
diabetes and increased sympathetic nervous system activity
and decreased renal sodium excretion. These may produce
arteriosclerosis and hypertension.20 ± 24 Previous reports have
demonstrated abdominal obesity to be an independent risk
factor for coronary heart disease.25,26 Similar mechanisms are
postulated for overall obesity and overweight.27 Excess car-
diovascular risk at low levels of SSF or BMI have been
attributed to high rates of weight loss, smoking, alcohol
use, subclinical disease, and comorbidity in thin per-
sons.28 ± 30
SFR likely measures a somewhat different aspect of relative
body fat distribution than other measures such as waist
circumference or waist ± hip ratio.31 ± 33 Although likely not
an optimal measure, especially for clinical settings,1 its
advantages are long-established standardized methods and
wide availability in data sets from large population surveys.
Subscapular skinfold measures subcutaneous truncal fat, a
somewhat different aspect of absolute truncal body fat than
measures such waist girth, which measures subcutaneous
and intraabdominal fat, or intraabdominal fat on computer-
ized tomographic scanning for visceral fat. Unlike the girth
or radiographic measures, skinfolds do not directly re¯ect
visceral fat. However, reported associations with incidence of
hypertension have been similar.2,5 Further in other studies
using computed tomography or MRI, subcutaneous abdom-
inal fat was at least as strong a correlate of insulin sensitivity
as visceral fat, and retained signi®cance after controlling for
visceral fat.32 ± 34 Further an android pattern of skinfold
thicknesses was associated with greater absolute and propor-
tional amounts of visceral adipose tissue than a gynoid
pattern.35 Skinfolds should not be affected by changes in
lean body mass with aging.
Previous studies have yielded con¯icting results, most
demonstrating an association of central body fat distribution
with increased stroke risk independent of overall obesity
level,5,6,36 ± 41 but a few failing to show such an association.42

Some previous reports have also indicated effect modi®ca-
tion by smoking with effects of obesity and overweight
restricted to nonsmokers. The ®ndings of the present study
of SFR are not inconsistent with those of previous reports of
SFR and incidence of stroke in white men6 but did not
con®rm a reported association in white women5 followed
2 ± 5 y. A retrospective longitudinal analysis of white soldiers
discharged in 1946 ± 1947 (mean age 23.8 y) and followed for
mortality for 23 y revealed a positive association of waist-to-
hip ratio and stroke mortality controlling for rank or BMI.36

Obesity, overweight and stroke
RF Gillum et al
635
International Journal of Obesity
In middle-aged Japanese men in Hawaii, subscapular
skinfold thickness, but not BMI, or SFR was signi®cantly
associated with risk of stroke over a 20-y follow-up.42 In
middle-aged Finnish men, subscapular skinfold was
positively associated with stroke incidence independent of
BMI and other variables including plasma insulin.41 In the
Framingham Study, waist-to-height ratio was related to
stroke in men and women.37 Other studies reported waist-
to-hip ratio to be positively associated with stroke risk in
men.6,38
Previous studies of obesity (SSF) and overweight (BMI) and
stroke risk yielded con¯icting results. Overall overweight or
obesity was independently associated with stroke risk in
some reports27,43 ± 45 but not others.5,6,36,38 ± 40,46,47 U-shaped
associations of SSF or BMI with stroke risk have been
described.45 ± 47 It seems likely that elevated BMI is a risk
factor only for ischemic stroke.27 Interactions with smoking
and hypertension have been suggested.43,46 Recent weight
loss was associated with increased stroke risk.45
Limitations
Limitations of the study include possible bias arising from
loss to follow-up, missing data on baseline risk variables,
and, for the incidence analysis, missing hospital data at
follow-up. However, repeating the regression analysis for
total stroke including cases of self-reported stroke without
a matching medical record at follow-up (87 in whites, 21 in
blacks) produced no major changes in the results. A further
source of possible bias was misclassi®cation due to inaccu-
racy of diagnoses coded on death certi®cates and medical
records, especially regarding stroke subgroups.48 ± 50 Inaccu-
racy of baseline history of stroke could result in cases being
identi®ed during follow-up that were actually diagnosed
prior to baseline. Further, for stroke incidence the year of
onset was taken as the year of ®rst hospitalization but this
could be in error if an earlier hospitalization for stroke was
not reported or the records not found. Extensive athero-
sclerosis might itself cause weight loss. Exclusion of preva-
lent stroke cases at baseline and controlling for history of
heart disease make this an unlikely source of bias in this
analysis.
Lack of valid measures or errors in measurement of body
fat distribution, obesity or overweight could be a source of
bias.51,52 However, the rigorously standardized measurement
protocols used minimized measurement errors, which in any
case should be random producing bias towards the null.
Further, adipose tissue distribution and weight are not
stable over long periods of time; this causes misclassi®cation
when only a baseline measure is used.28 It seems likely,
however, that any bias would be toward the null. Means
and distributions of multiple baseline characteristics of the
NHEFS cohort by SFR level have been published.2,26
Errors in measurement of other baseline variables could
also result in bias but this seems unlikely given the standar-
dized nature of the NHANES I examination. One exception
was baseline smoking data, which were derived or imputed
from follow-up interview questions for about half the
cohort. However, this approach has been judged valid for
analyses of mortality.16 Confounding by variables not mea-
sured cannot be excluded. Statistical power was lower for
blacks than for whites. However, when analyses for blacks
were repeated using tertiles instead of quartiles of obesity
variables, results were consistent with those using quartiles
as shown.
Most cases of stroke occurred in persons aged 65 ± 74 at
baseline. Increased stroke incidence was linked to central
obesity and overweight in white men. Previous analyses of
BMI and BMI change and mortality in this cohort suggest
that this excess risk might be preventable by primary pre-
vention of overweight (BMI b 25), but probably not by
weight reduction in the elderly.28,53,54 Involuntary weight
loss in those over 65 may be caused by a number of chronic
disabling conditions such as arthritis, heart disease, claudi-
cation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and osteo-
porosis among others.28 Nevertheless, the ®ndings regarding
effects of maintaining acceptable BMI throughout young
adulthood and middle age and mortality together with the
low percentage of men in whom this occurs, suggests a
signi®cant role for obesity and overweight prevention in
stroke prevention at least in white men.1,28,53 Despite the
association of low SSF and BMI with increased stroke risk in
black women, primary prevention of obesity and overweight
might still be bene®cial, if stroke victims had low body
weight due to weight loss from extensive comorbidity,
some of which might be obesity related.28,30,53 Clearly
further research in this group is needed.
Conclusions
In a complex relationship, higher SFR was associated with a
mildly but signi®cantly increased incidence of stroke only in
white male former smokers, especially those with high BMI.
Several possible mechanisms for such an association have
been suggested. SSF showed a U-shaped association with
stroke risk. In white men, stroke risk was elevated in the
top quartile of BMI only in never smokers. In black women,
stroke risk was elevated in the bottom quartile of BMI. More
studies of these associations with stroke risk are needed,
especially in former smokers and black women. Studies
should clarify the relationship of subcutaneous truncal
fat, intraabdominal fat, and total fat and their relative
importance in the pathogenesis of various types of cerebral
infarction.
