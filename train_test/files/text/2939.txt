Abstract
Most of the literature addressing multiple banking assumes equal financing shares.
However, unequal, concentrated or asymmetric bank borrowing is widespread. This paper
investigates the determinants of creditor concentration for German firms using a
comprehensive bank-firm level dataset for the time period between 1993 and 2003. We
document that lending is very often concentrated and, consequently, that relationship
lending is important, not only for the small firms but also for the larger firms in our sample.
However, we also find that risky, illiquid, large and leveraged firms spread their borrowing
more evenly between multiple lenders. On the other hand, the degree of concentration
increases with the profitability of the relationship lender. Relationship lending may spur
financing provided by other banks, especially if the relationship lender is a public sector
bank and if the other banks are large or do not have to tie up additional funds in capital.

Non-technical summary
In this paper, we empirically investigate the degree of creditor concentration of German
firms by exploring the asymmetry in borrowing. Under asymmetric or concentrated bank
borrowing we understand the situation when firms predominately borrow from one
relationship lender and parallel borrow smaller amounts from multiple arm's-length
lenders. The German financial system with its Hausbank notion presents itself an ideal
environment to study creditor concentration since many firms borrow not only from their
Hausbank but also seek funding, to a varying degree, from other banks.
Although there is an evidence of the asymmetry in borrowing only a few recent papers
model creditor concentration (Elsas, Heinemann and Tyrell (2004), Guiso and Minetti
(2004), Bannier (2005, 2006) and Schuele (2006)). We contribute to this emerging
literature by empirically investigating the degree of creditor concentration of German firms.
In this paper (i) we suggest concentration as a more detailed measure of bank-firm
relationships; (ii) we study the impact of firm and market characteristics and the
characteristics of the relationship lender on our measures of creditor concentration; (iii) we
study the impact of the financing decisions of the relationship lender on the lending
behavior of other banks.
To investigate these issues we use a comprehensive dataset collected by the Deutsche
Bundesbank. The dataset is a matched bank-firm level dataset with 16,713 firm-bank-year
observations consisting of three sources: the German credit register (MiMik), firm balance
sheets (Jalys/Ustan) and bank balance sheets (BAKIS), for a period of eleven years between
1993 and 2003.
Our findings suggest that firm, bank and market characteristics are important
determinants of the degree of the concentration in financing. We find that higher quality
firms and firms with more redeployable (liquid) assets choose more concentrated
borrowing. Therefore, our study confirms hypotheses in Detragiache, Garella and Guiso
(2000) and Bris and Welch (2005) about the positive effect of firm quality on creditor
concentration. Smaller firms and less leveraged firms have a higher concentration in their
borrowing as well. Additionally, the degree of creditor concentration is positively related to
the regional market concentration of bank lending.
Moreover, we find that the characteristics of the relationship lender have an influence on
the degree of creditor concentration. Concentration increases with the increase in the
profitability of the relationship lender. This finding confirms Detragiache, Garella and
Guiso (2000).
Finally, we find that financing decision of the relationship lender is positively correlated
with the lending behavior of other banks. Other banks tend to extend their lending with the
increase in the exposure of the relationship lender. This tendency appears to be stronger if
the relationship bank is a public sector bank rather than a private bank. However, there are
also some limits to this tendency, set by the size and by the capital of the other banks.
Our results suggest that those firms that are low in quality and have illiquid assets per se
will be most affected by the distress of the relationship bank if the relationship bank is not
able to continue financing. According to our findings these firms, however, have a lower
degree of concentration in their borrowing and tend to increase their borrowing from other
banks.
Nicht technische Zusammenfassung
In diesem Papier wird die Gläubigerkonzentration deutscher Unternehmen untersucht,
wobei die Analyse der Asymmetrie bei der Kreditaufnahme im Vordergrund steht. Unter
Asymmetrie und Gläubigerkonzentration verstehen wir eine Situation, in der die Firmen
ihre Kredite überwiegend von der Hausbank aufnehmen und gleichzeitig kleinere Kredite
bei anderen Instituten beanspruchen. Für eine solche Untersuchung bietet das deutsche
Finanzsystem mit seinem Hausbankprinzip ideale Rahmenbedingungen, denn viele Firmen
verschulden sich nicht nur bei Ihrer Hausbank, sondern suchen sich darüber hinaus ­ in
unterschiedlichem Umfang ­ alternative Finanzierungsquellen.
Obwohl man Asymmetrie bei der Kreditaufnahme von Firmen beobachtet, gibt es nur
sehr wenige wissenschaftliche Papiere, die sich mit der Gläubigerkonzentration der
Unternehmen beschäftigen (Elsas, Heinemann and Tyrell (2004), Guiso and Minetti (2004),
Bannier (2005, 2006) und Schüle (2006)). Mit unserem Papier tragen wir zu dieser
Literatur bei, indem wir empirisch den Grad der Gläubigerkonzentration bei deutschen
Unternehmen untersuchen.
Konkret (i) schlagen wir Gläubigerkonzentration als ein genaueres Maß für die
Untersuchung von Bank-Firmen-Beziehungen vor; (ii) untersuchen wir den Einfluss der
Firmen-, Markt- und Hausbank-Charakteristika auf die Gläubigerkonzentration der
Unternehmen; (iii) analysieren wir den Einfluss der Finanzierungsentscheidungen der
Hausbank auf das Kreditverhalten von anderen Banken.
Als Datenbasis verwenden wir einen von der Deutschen Bundesbank erhobenen
Datensatz, der bank- und firmenspezifische Informationen umfasst und damit eine
dynamische Untersuchung der Gläubigerkonzentration erlaubt. Im Datensatz enthalten sind
insgesamt 16.713 Beobachtungen (Unternehmens-Banken-Jahre), die den elfjährigen
Zeitraum zwischen 1993 und 2003 abdecken und aus drei Quellen stammen:
Evidenzzentrale für Millionenkredite (MiMik), Firmenbilanzen (Jalys/Ustan) sowie
Bankbilanzen (BAKIS).
Unsere Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass Firmen-, Bank- und Marktcharakteristika
wichtige Determinanten der Gläubigerkonzentration darstellen. Unter anderem zeigt sich,
dass Firmen mit besserer Bonität und liquiden Aktiva zu einer höheren
Gläubigerkonzentration bei der Kreditaufnahme tendieren. Demzufolge bestätigt unsere
Studie die Hypothesen von Detragiache, Garella und Guiso (2000) und Bris und Welch
(2005) bezüglich des positiven Einflusses der Bonität von Firmen auf die
Gläubigerkonzentration. Dies gilt auch für kleinere Firmen und Firmen mit niedrigem
Fremdkapitalanteil. Außerdem ist die Gläubigerkonzentration um so höher, je
konzentrierter die Kreditvergabe bei einigen wenigen Banken in der Region ist.
Darüber hinaus zeigt sich, dass die Profitabilität der Hausbank mit einer höheren
Gläubigerkonzentration einhergeht. Auch dieses Ergebnis bestätigt Detragiache, Garella
und Guiso (2000).
Schließlich können wir zeigen, dass die Kreditentscheidung der Hausbank positiv mit
dem Kreditvergabeverhalten anderer Banken korreliert. Andere Institute scheinen um so
eher bereit zu sein, einen Kredit zu gewähren, je höher der Kredit der Hausbank ist. Dieser
Effekt wird verstärkt, wenn es sich um ein öffentlich-rechtliches Institut und nicht um eine
private Bank handelt. Allerdings begrenzen Größe und Kapitalisierung der anderen Banken
diese Bereitschaft.
Unsere Ergebnisse legen zunächst nahe, dass Unternehmen von geringer Bonität und mit
illiquiden Aktiva besonders betroffen sein könnten, wenn Ihre Hausbank zu
zurückfallenden Kreditgewährung gezwungen wäre. Tatsächlich zeigen unsere
Untersuchungen aber, dass gerade bei diesen Unternehmen eine geringere
Gläubigerkonzentration bei der Kreditaufnahme vorliegt und diese Firmen in der Regel ihre
Kreditaufnahme bei anderen Banken erhöhen können.

Creditor Concentration: An Empirical Investigation*
I. Introduction
Multiple banking is an important economic phenomenon. There is cross-country evidence
that many firms establish relationships with multiple banks. Houston and James (1996), for
example, show that more than 60 percent of listed US firms have multiple bank
relationships. And Ongena and Smith (2000), analyzing bank relationships in 20 European
countries, show that only less than fifteen percent of the firms borrow from a single bank
and that the average number of bank relationships is greater than five. Even small firms that
would benefit most from relationship lending, borrow from multiple banks (Guiso and
Minetti, 2004).
Many studies focus on the optimal number of creditors, the determinants and the impact
of multiple bank relationships. One key explanation for observing multiple bank
relationships is that it reduces the hold-up problem of relationship lending (Rajan, 1992 and
von Thadden, 1992). But multiple banking can lead to coordination failure in case of
default (Bolton and Scharfstein, 1996; Hart, 1995; Dewatripont and Maskin, 1995). Bolton
and Scharfstein (1996) show that multiple bank lending lowers the liquidation value of the
firm and only the firms of the highest credit quality tend to borrow from multiple creditors.

Bris and Welch (2005), on the other hand, argue that higher quality firms choose fewer
creditors signaling their confidence of not going bankrupt given that concentration
enhances their creditors' bargaining power.
Other studies emphasize the banks' perspective as well when exploring the optimal
number of relationships. Detragiache, Garella and Guiso (2000), for example, explain how
multiple relationships arise from the firms' need for diversification of bank liquidity risk.
Carletti (2004) explores how the number of bank relationships affects banks' monitoring
incentives, and Carletti, Cerasi and Daltung (2005) analyze banks' incentives to finance a
firm jointly with other banks when they have limited lending abilities and monitoring is
important.
However, most of the literature addressing multiple banking assumes equal financing
shares (in contrast, a large proportion of the literature deals with majority versus minority
equity holders). However, unequal, asymmetric or concentrated bank borrowing is
widespread, as firms often borrow extensively from one relationship lender and smaller
amounts from multiple arm's-length lenders. Petersen and Rajan (1994), for example,
examine lending relationships of US firms and report that the degree of concentration in
borrowing decreases in firm size.
Creditor concentration may play a pivotal role in balancing the hold-up problem of
relationship lending with the coordination failure of multiple bank lending but only a few
recent papers model creditor concentration. Elsas, Heinemann and Tyrell (2004) analyze
the optimal debt structure for multiple but asymmetric bank financing. They emphasize the
role of the relationship lender in mitigating the coordination problem. They show that firms
with low expected cash flows or with assets of lower liquidation value prefer asymmetric
financing. And Guiso and Minetti (2004) argue that banks prevent unsound firms from
defaulting for the purpose of seizing their assets during the restructuring process. As a
2
result, firms with more valuable and redeployable assets tend to spread their borrowing
more unevenly to prevent this kind of behavior by the relationship lender during
restructuring because, with higher asymmetry, less informed banks would have no
incentive to continue the project (see also Bannier, 2005 and 2006, and Schuele, 2006,
among others).
We contribute to this emerging literature by empirically investigating the degree of
creditor concentration of German firms. Our analysis of creditor concentration is not only
motivated by recent unpublished theoretical work but also by unexplored implications in
recently published theoretical papers. The diversification argument in Detragiache, Garella
and Guiso (2000), for example, also explains creditor concentration. Firms that choose
single relationship banking in their model can just as easily borrow from non-relationship
banks if their relationship bank has liquidity problems.
The German financial system presents itself as an ideal environment to study creditor
concentration. Many firms borrow not only from their Hausbank but also seek funding, to a
varying degree, from multiple other banks (see Elsas and Krahnen, 1998). A comprehensive
dataset collected by the Deutsche Bundesbank over a long period of time allows us to
dynamically investigate creditor concentration. The dataset is a matched bank-firm level
dataset consisting of three sources: The German credit register, firm balance sheets and
bank balance sheets, for a period of eleven years between 1993 and 2003. This unique
dataset allows us to observe individual lender shares and to analyze the pervasive presence
of creditor concentration in Germany.
We first construct alternative measures of creditor concentration originally designed to
measure market concentration. We then study the impact of firm and bank characteristics
on our measures of creditor concentration. In particular, we focus on the characteristics of
the relationship lender, which we identify as the bank with the largest financing share.
3
Finally, controlling for firm and bank characteristics, we explore the impact of the largest
exposure on the size of the other exposures.
We comprehensively document that creditor concentration is a pervasive phenomenon.
Consequently, relationship lending seems important, not only for the small firms but also
for the larger firms in our sample. We further find that higher quality firms and firms with
more redeployable assets concentrate their borrowing. The degree of creditor concentration
is also positively related to the regional market concentration of bank lending, confirming
that many firms are geographically limited in their funding choices.
The characteristics of the relationship lender have an influence on the degree of creditor
concentration as well. Concentration increases when the relationship lender is more
profitable, for example. An increase in financing provided by the relationship lender further
coincides with increases in financing provided by the other lenders. The other lenders seem
to align their credit decisions with those of the relationship lender but only within the limits
set by their own size and without tying up their funds in capital. Overall, our results
indicate the importance of firm, bank and market characteristics in determining the
concentration of financing.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present selected
theoretical models dealing with the issue of multiple banking, explore their implications for
asymmetric financing and review recent other work modeling creditor concentration. In
Section III, we describe the data and the methodology. We present the main estimation
results in Section IV, followed by a series of robustness tests in Section V. Section VI
concludes our findings.

II. Literature Review
A. Number of Relationships
A growing theoretical literature addresses the issue of the optimal number of creditors.
Models explaining the existence of multiple credit relationships differ in their timing (see
Figure 1), mechanisms, outcomes and relevance for the asymmetry question. In this section,
we compare the mechanisms and the different outcomes of recent theoretical models (Table
1 summarizes this discussion).
Bolton and Scharfstein (1996) explore the impact of the debt structure on the
renegotiation that may take place in the case of firm default. The optimal debt structure,
they argue, balances the benefits and costs of multiple banking. Multiple bank relationships
discourage managers from strategically defaulting on a loan. But, when default is caused by
liquidity problems, as in Hart and Moore (1989) and Bolton and Scharfstein (1990),
multiple lending is costly since it reduces the expected liquidation value of assets. Bolton
and Scharfstein (1996) further explain how the optimal debt structure depends on firm
characteristics. Firms with low default risk and asset complementarity should borrow from
two creditors. However, when outside buyers highly value the assets, it is more attractive
for firms to borrow from one creditor to maximize the liquidation value.
Bris and Welch (2005) argue that due to free-riding and coordination problems dispersed
creditors face difficulties collecting their claims during bankruptcy. A firm that opts for
multiple creditors ex ante assumes a better bargaining position in the case of financial
distress ex post. As a result, according to Bris and Welch, higher quality firms can signal
their confidence of not going bankrupt by selecting only a few creditors.
Firms may also seek to diversify bank liquidity risk by engaging multiple financiers.
According to Detragiache, Garella and Guiso (2000), for example, establishing multiple
5
relationships reduces the risk of early liquidation of a project (if liquidity shocks across
banks are imperfectly correlated). Their model predicts that multiple banking is more likely
when banks are less fragile (but adverse selection is more severe), judicial enforcement is
inefficient and the investment projects of the firm are not very profitable. Once in the
multiple banking region, the optimal number of relationship banks increases with bank
fragility, the efficiency of enforcement and the profitability of the projects.
The three models discussed so far may also provide an insight into asymmetric
financing. Bolton and Scharfstein (1996) and Bris and Welch (2005) both emphasize the
coordination problems arising with multiple creditors. An increase in the asymmetry in the
financing shares makes coordination easier by either decreasing the likelihood of
liquidation or by signaling firm quality. Detragiache, Garella and Guiso (2000) already note
asymmetry in their single banking region. When adverse selection is mild, firms opt for
single relationship banking as they can easily borrow from non-relationship banks if a
liquidity shock affects their relationship bank. However, under the multiple banking
regime, the model has no implications with respect to the financing shares.
B. Asymmetry in Borrowing
Elsas, Heinemann and Tyrell (2004), Guiso and Minetti (2004), Bannier (2005, 2006) and
Schuele (2006) tackle the issue of asymmetric bank financing. Elsas, Heinemann and Tyrell
(2004), for example, examine the optimal debt structure and find that especially firms
characterized by high asset specificity (a high expected loss given default from the banks'
perspective or a lower liquidation value) and firms with low expected cash flows prefer
asymmetric financing. With efficient coordination, expected firm profits decrease in the
size of the financing share of the relationship lender that collects all of the benefits.
However, the presence of the relationship lender may still be beneficial for the firm since it
6
allows for continuation in more states of the world. As a result, the expected profits of the
many arm's-length lenders actually increase in the financing share of the relationship lender
as it is more likely that these small credits will be repaid. The authors also analyze the
relationship between the liquidation value of the firm and the share of the relationship
lender. They infer a non-linear relationship.
Guiso and Minetti (2004) investigate how the informational advantage of a relationship
lender would affect the reorganization process of a firm in distress. They show that the
optimal allocation of information by the firm across multiple banks is related to the
redeployability of the firm's assets and its restructuring costs. A relationship lender can
easily recognize both the value of the firm's assets and the quality of a project. However,
the relationship lender may use this greater restructuring ability opportunistically to extract
rents during reorganization. Thus banks may decide to continue bad projects if firms have
more valuable and more redeployable assets. Firms with this type of assets may prefer a
higher asymmetry in allocating their information rights across creditors to prevent such
opportunistic behavior. They argue that as the degree of asymmetry increases, smaller
creditors would have fewer incentives to continue a project since the relationship lender
would get all of the benefits. Guiso and Minetti (2004) test their predictions on a sample of
US firms and report a negative impact of the share of illiquid assets on the degree of
creditor concentration.
Bannier (2005) models the reasons as to why asymmetric bank financing exists. Her
model predicts that the higher information precision obtained by a relationship lender leads
to a lower probability of an inefficient credit withdrawal for firms with low expected cash
flows. While, for firms with high expected cash flows, the opposite holds true and
asymmetric financing still results in fewer inefficient credit decisions compared to
financing by a single lender and by multiple lenders with equal shares. Bannier (2006)
7
investigates asymmetric financing and optimal firm policy. The degree of asymmetry
enables the firm to signal its willingness to abstain from strategically defaulting,
eliminating the risk of inefficient credit withdrawal.
Schuele (2006) examines how a relationship bank can lend in forbearance and, by its
ability to signal, play a coordinating role for the other creditors. The roll-over decision of a
relationship bank will be positively related to its financing share and inversely related to the
value of collateral.1
Coordination problems are not an issue in the case of bankruptcy when lenders are
forced to cooperate. German banks coordinate successfully by forming creditor pools when
the firm is in distress (Brunner and Krahnen, 2001). Consequently, theoretical arguments
explaining the role of the relationship lender under multiple and asymmetric borrowing
need to be adjusted to fit this scenario. However, for the refinancing stage, coordination
problems and the role of the large lender remain highly relevant. Coordination problems
may also be an issue in syndicated loans; Sufi (2007), for example, investigates how
information asymmetry influences loan syndicate structure. In contrast, we focus on
creditor concentration at firm level.
III. Data and Methodology
A. Data Sources
We employ a unique matched bank-firm level dataset that contains annual information from
1993 to 2003. The data combines three databases, i.e. the credit register (MiMik), the
1 In other models that analyze the certification role of intermediaries, the quality of the creditor's information
is guaranteed by the size of its own investment in the firm. Jean-Baptiste (2005), for example, argues that
this investment could serve as a credible signal as long as the price of the loan is taken into account while
Takeda and Takeda (2006) analyze how the refinancing decision of a large lender affects other lenders'
and the firm's behavior. This approach is in line with the model by Biais and Gollier (1997) where trade
credit with its informational content has an impact on the credit decisions of banks.
8
balance sheet data for the firms (Jalys/Ustan) and the balance sheet data for the banks
(BAKIS2). These data sources make it possible to observe individual lender shares of
German banks at firm level and to combine this information with firm and bank-specific
balance sheet information.
1. Credit Register
The Deutsche Bundesbank's credit register (MiMik) is the main data source for the
individual exposures of German banks to firms. The data contains information on large
exposures of 1.5 million Euros (formerly 3 million DM) and above. German banks are
required to report their exposures exceeding this reporting threshold to the Deutsche
Bundesbank on a quarterly basis.3 Therefore, exposures to small and medium-sized firms
might be underrepresented in this database. However, if the sum of the exposures to firms
in a borrower unit exceeds the threshold of 1.5 million Euros, the individual exposure to a
firm in that borrower unit is reported, even if it is a small exposure. This reporting partly
abates the bias in the credit register towards medium and large-sized firms.
The data in the credit register is not consolidated.4 Bank exposures to firms in the credit
register are defined fairly broadly, e.g. they include not only corporate loans but also
corporate bonds.5 In the credit register we are able to distinguish between on-balance sheet
2 BAKIS is the BAKred Information System. The German Federal Banking Supervisory Office
(Bundesaufsichtsamt für das Kreditwesen (BAKred)) is one of the three supervisory agencies that merged
in 2002 to form the current national supervisor, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority
(Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht).
3 For a more detailed definition, see Section 14 of the Banking Act (Deutsche Bundesbank, 2001). If
exposures of 1.5 million Euros or above existed during the reporting period but are partly or fully repaid,
the remaining exposure is reported even if the amount is zero. We take the actual amounts of the exposures
into consideration.
4 The consolidation of the data implies that the inter-office positions between a head institution and its
domestic subsidiaries are netted out and the positions are allocated to a single corporate banking group
(Konzern).
5 For a more detailed definition of the bank exposures, see Section 19 of the Banking Act (Deutsche
Bundesbank, 2001). The following items are deemed not to be bank exposures: shares in other enterprises
and securities in the trading portfolio.
9
and off-balance sheet items.6 We choose to use only on-balance sheet positions since the
inclusion of off-balance sheet exposures leads to an overstatement of the actual exposures
due to guarantees provided by banks to the other banks. The credit register also contains
information on firm identity, location, industry, legal form and the date of bankruptcy (if
applicable).
2. Firm and Bank Balance Sheet Data
We also use Jalys/Ustan and BAKIS to construct firm and bank-specific variables.
Jalys/Ustan contains annual financial statement information for many German firms.7 For
2003, for example, the dataset contains records on 9,977 firms. The credit register is
matched with the firm-specific data from Jalys/Ustan first. After matching, our sample
consists of 2,402 firms over the entire period.8
The dataset is finally matched with BAKIS. BAKIS contains bank financial statements as
well as information on the banking groups for all German banks. For 2003, for example, the
dataset contains records on 2,265 banks. After matching, the sample consists of an average
number of 276 banks / year.9
6 For example, lease receivables, mortgage loans, publicly guaranteed loans, and inter-bank loans (with a
residual maturity of up to one year) are listed separately under on-balance sheet activities. Off-balance
sheet items include derivatives (other than written option positions), guarantees assumed to cover these and
other off-balance sheet transactions (Deutsche Bundesbank, 1998).
7 There are four balance sheet types in Jalys/Ustan: opening balance sheet (Eröffnungsbilanz), main balance
sheet (Rumpfbilanz), tax balance sheet (Steuerbilanz) and commercial balance sheet (Handelsbilanz).
However, our matched dataset consists mainly of firms with either a tax balance sheet (2/3rds of the
sample) or a commercial balance sheet. Considering possible reporting differences among balance sheet
types, we re-estimate our specifications including only firms with a tax balance sheet as a robustness
check. The results remain unchanged.
8 See the Appendix for a more detailed description of the matching process.
9 In our study, we include all banking groups in Germany. During the time period, many bank mergers took
place. See the Appendix for a detailed description of the treatment of bank mergers.

B. Measuring Concentration of Borrowing
We analyze concentration of borrowing at firm level using alternative measures originally
designed to measure market concentration. Concentration in an industry can be measured in
a variety of ways. Bikker and Haaf (2000) compare ten different concentration measures.
The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is one of the most frequently used indices to
measure market concentration and it often serves as a benchmark. The HHI captures the
entire distribution of shares. For our application, the HHI is defined as:
2
1
,
n
jt ijt
i
HHI s
=
= ¦ (1)
where sijt
equals Loanijt
divided by Total Loansjt
, and where Loanijt
equals the amount of
credit granted by bank i to firm j in year t and Total Loansjt
is the total amount of credit
obtained by firm j in year t. The index is sometimes criticized because it attaches greater
weight to larger shares as each share is used as its own weight.
Hannan (1997) studies whether the HHI can adequately account for both market share
inequality and the number of banks in the industry. He decomposes the HHI into two terms:
2
( / ) (1/ ),
jt jt jt jt
HHI V N N
= + (2)
where Vjt
2/Njt
is the share of inequality divided by the number of banks and 1/Njt
is the
inverse of the number of banks. His decomposition is relevant for our study because we
explore the asymmetry in financing. As in Hannan (1997), we subtract the inverse of the
number of banks, 1/Njt
, from the HHI to obtain Vjt
2/Njt
, which we label the Share of
Inequality Index (SII).10 We estimate all models both with an HHI and an SII.
10 One important difference is that the HHI is the dependent variable in our model.
11
Horvath (1970) suggests a comprehensive measure of concentration, which reflects both
relative dispersion and absolute magnitude. The Comprehensive Industrial Concentration
Index (CCI) is defined as:
2
1
2
(1 (1 ))
n
jt jt ijt ijt
i
CCI s s s
=
= + + -
¦ (3)
The index is computed as the sum of the proportional share of the leading bank (largest
exposure) and the total of the squares of the other banks' shares, weighted by a multiplier
that reflects the shares of the remaining part. The CCI weighs the squared share of smaller
exposures by (2 )
ijt
s
- . Therefore, compared with the HHI, the CCI is more sensitive to the
changes in the smaller shares and, possibly, more suitable for measuring concentration in
cartel markets (Stordal, 2004). Given the presence of concentrated borrowing in the
German financial system, we also employ the CCI as an alternative measure.
Finally, we also calculate a simple linear concentration measure. We take the sum of the
three largest borrowing shares to compute the concentration of a firm to its three largest
creditors, CR3:
3
1
3
jt ijt
i
CR s
=
= ¦
Figure 2 presents the time variation in our concentration measures. All measures are
relatively stable over the sample period, except for the decrease in the last year. A sharp
decrease in the number of firms in the sample in 2003 may be partly responsible, a
selection issue we address in the robustness section.
C. Addressing the Effects of the Reporting Threshold
The existence of a reporting threshold of 1.5 million Euros potentially introduces a bias in
the sample. Using HHI as the concentration measure helps us to deal with the bias since it
puts less weight on the smaller financing shares that are more likely to be below the
12
threshold. Still, the index is possibly consistently overestimated for small firms for which
larger shares are also unobserved.
We deal with this threshold issue in two ways. First, we simply exclude all small firms
in robustness checks. Second, and in order to deal with the effects of the reporting threshold
more systematically, we calculate the HHI using two opposite assumptions about the
composition of the unobserved part of the loans in the credit register. The amount of the
unobserved part of the loans for a particular firm is defined as the difference between the
Total Loansjt
, taken from the firm's balance sheet, and the sum of loan exposures, Loanijt
,
taken from the credit register. Under the first assumption, the unobserved part of loans is
concentrated in one bank as long as it is not above 1.5 million Euros (because otherwise it
would have been observed in the credit register):

But if the unobserved part of loans is above 1.5 million Euros, the amount will be
distributed among banks. The first bank gets assigned up to 1.499 million Euros, which is
the maximum loan amount that is potentially unobservable; the second bank gets assigned
the remaining part up to 1.499 million Euros; and so on. This procedure makes our
calculations more precise. Formally, we define the HHI as:

where kjt
is the integer number obtained by dividing the unobserved part of the loans by
1.499. We use both measures alternatively in our estimations and compare the results.
Under the second assumption, the rest of the loans is diversified across an infinite
number of banks. As a result, the remaining terms in the HHI equal zero:

We first estimate the regression models under the more realistic assumption that the
unobserved part of loans is concentrated, then re-estimate all models under the assumption
that the unobserved part is diversified among an infinite number of banks.11
Tables 2 and 3 present the structure of the relationships based on the two assumptions.
Number of creditors, share of firms with a single bank or multiple banks and share of loans
are first reported using the available data in the credit register. The figures imply that more
than half of German firms borrow from a single bank. However, due to the reporting
threshold, a considerable part of the loan exposures, around 30 percent in the case of the
single bank, are not observable in the database. Assuming that the unobserved loans are
concentrated in one bank with a maximum tolerable amount of 1.499 million Euros, we
find that the share of firms with a single bank is thirteen percent instead of 55 percent.
Moreover, as Table 3 shows, the average number of relationships increases from 2.14 to
3.97 when we assume the unobserved part of loans is concentrated.
D. Description of Explanatory Variables
We explain the degree of concentration with firm, bank and market-specific variables. The
definition and measurement of the variables is summarized in Table 4. Empirical studies
that investigate firm characteristics as the determinants of relationship lending typically
focus on size, age, profitability/cash flow and financial leverage (e.g. Detragiache, Garella
and Guiso, 2000; Harhoff and Körting, 1998 and Machauer and Weber, 2000).
Size is an important factor in determining the borrowing behavior of a firm. We measure
size as the log of Total Assets of the firm. It is argued that smaller firms benefit more from

results remain virtually unchanged.
14
relationship banking due to their informational opaqueness. In addition, ownership structure
might be related to the informational opaqueness as well (Volpin, 2001). However, we do
not have information about ownership concentration in our data. To proxy for ownership
structure, we include a dummy variable identifying the legal form of the enterprise
(corporation or partnership).
For profitability, we use Return on Assets (ROA). Financial Leverage, computed as
Financial Debt to Total Assets of the firm, shows the dependence of the company on bank
debt. It is used as a proxy for the riskiness of the company as well. Probability of Default is
a proxy for the quality of the firm.12 To measure asset specificity, we use the Share of
Illiquid Assets (i.e., Intangibles plus Fixed Assets to Total Assets).13
We are also interested in exploring whether regional characteristics play a role in
determining the concentration of firms in their creditors. Therefore, we control for banks'
concentration in the region where the firm is located. We measure regional lender
concentration using the HHI of the loans in that particular region. We do not control for
firms' access to other sources of financing such as bonds. The sample firms are rather bank
dependent in their financing and the share of bonds is negligible in the data with a mean
value of 0.002. Table 5 summarizes the descriptive statistics for all explanatory variables.
Detragiache, Garella and Guiso (2000) argue that firms may diversify bank liquidity risk
by establishing multiple relationships. By including bank characteristics such as size and
12 Probability of Default (PD) is calculated in Krueger, Stoetzel and Trueck (2005) who explain ratings using
balance sheet variables. Their predicted Z-Score is transformed to calculate the PD variable: PD=eZ/(1+eZ).
Since the PD is an estimated variable, it is necessary to adjust the standard errors when including it as an
explanatory variable (as we use standard errors that are robust to heteroskedasticity, we need not be
concerned about such an adjustment).
13 Intangible assets reported on the balance sheet in Germany contain only the purchased intangible assets,
such as patents. We exclude the intangible assets from the Share of Illiquid Assets and re-estimate all
specifications. Results remain unchanged. Fixed assets may capture the impact of collateral on the degree
of informational asymmetry. Since information on collateral is not available in the data, we exclude "land"
and "buildings", which are commonly used as collateral, and re-estimate our model. Alternatively, we use
"cash" instead of fixed assets to measure liquidity. All results remain virtually unchanged. We also note
that our sample consists of relatively large firms that are typically under less pressure to post collateral.
15
fragility, we explore the impact of bank characteristics on the firms' choice of multiple
banking as well as the degree of concentration in borrowing. We basically investigate the
impact of the characteristics of the relationship lender, identified as the lender with the
largest share in financing. In empirical work, several proxies are used to distinguish
between relationship lenders and transactional lenders. These are the length of relationship
between the firm and the bank, loan categories (Detragiache, Garella and Guiso, 2000) and
survey responses by banks if they consider themselves to be the Hausbank of their
borrowers (Elsas and Krahnen, 1998). Since we do not have access to this type of
information, we take the largest financing share as a proxy for relationship lending. Elsas,
Heinemann and Tyrell (2004) and Guiso and Minetti (2004) also use shares as a proxy for
relationship lending. Moreover, Elsas (2005) finds evidence (using credit files of a few
large German banks) of a strong connection between the share of financing and the
probability of being the relationship lender. We further investigate the stability of
relationship lending defined using the largest share of a firm. For fourteen percent of firm-
year observations, firms change their relationship lender compared to the previous year.
This suggests our relationship definition is likely to be conservative as the hazard rate is
high compared to other estimates in the literature (Ongena and Smith, 2001; Farinha and
Santos, 2002).
We further focus on the impact of the largest exposure on other exposures. We expect a
relationship between the size of the largest exposure and the size and characteristics of the
other exposures. In Elsas, Heinemann and Tyrell (2004), the expected profits of small
lenders increase in the exposure of the largest lender. This might imply a positive
relationship between the largest exposure and the sizes of the other bank exposures.
Moreover, Bannier (2005) argues that the behavior of a relationship lender is observable to
the other banks and coordinates their actions. And in Schuele (2006) and Takeda and
16
Takeda (2006), the relationship bank also influences the transactional lenders through its
refinancing decisions. On the other hand, the ability of the relationship lender to extract
rents could increase in its financing share implying that the largest lender will get all of the
benefits and smaller lenders would not be willing to participate further in lending. Hence
whether and how the size of the largest exposure affects the other bank exposures remains
an empirical question that we will also address in the next section.

Previous studies often model the firm's decision process in two steps: first, the firm
decides whether or not to take one or multiple creditors, then the firm decides how many
17
banks or how concentrated it wants to borrow conditional on being in the multiple banking
region (Detragiache, Garella and Guiso,, 2000 and Guiso and Minetti, 2004). We leave the
two-stage empirical specification reflecting this two-step decision process to the robustness
section. In this section, we take the creditor concentration as continuous, varying between 0
and 1, where 1 presents the choice of one single creditor.
Table 6 presents the main results under the assumption that the unobserved part is
concentrated (see 3.2.1, Equation 5). Panel A includes only firm-specific variables. In the
first two columns we take the number of banks the firm borrows from as the dependent
variable. This helps us to see which factors increase the number of banks that firms choose
to borrow from and whether these factors are different from the ones that affect the degree
of concentration. The other columns explain our alternative measures for concentration.
The F-Test and the Breusch-Pagan-Test both indicate panel estimation techniques are to be
preferred. Because the Hausman-Test rejects random effects in multiple specifications, we
opt to report the results from the fixed effects models.
Probability of Default and Financial Debt alternatively act as a proxy for the quality of
the firm and these variables are included in different specifications to avoid
multicollinearity. Probability of Default is positively related to the number of banks (Log
N) and significantly negative in all other specifications, indicating that firms with a higher
probability of default are expected to have a higher number of banks and a lower degree of
creditor concentration. The magnitude of the coefficient is economically relevant as well
since an increase from 0.01 to 0.05 is estimated to decrease the HHI by 0.09 and the SII by
0.06. Such an increase in Probability of Default is not unrealistic when considering the size
of the standard deviation of 0.01 for the entire sample. In fact, it is even more plausible for
years with low economic growth. This finding is in line with the Bris and Welch (2005)
model in which high quality firms want more concentrated credit (but it seemingly
18
contradicts the arguments by Guiso and Minetti (2004) that the quality of the firm may not
be related to the degree of concentration). The magnitude of the coefficient when
explaining the degree of concentration is the highest for the specification with the HHI as
the dependent variable. This implies that for larger shares in financing, a change in
Probability of Default matters more, since HHI attaches greater weight to larger shares.
The size of the firm has a positive (negative) impact on the number (concentration).
Thus, larger firms not only tend to diversify their creditors, they also spread their borrowing
more evenly. This impact seems to originate in the asymmetry, not only in the number of
banks, since we also estimate that the model with alternative concentration measures is less
affected by the number of banks, and we find this impact to be robust.
Illiquid Assets, our proxy for the redeployability of assets, is inversely related to the
concentration measures in most of the specifications, a result also found by Guiso and
Minetti (2004). Financial Debt is also positively (inversely) related to the number of banks
(degree of concentration). The higher the bank indebtedness, the lower the degree of
concentration might be given the need for an increased number of creditors. On the other
hand, Financial Debt is often used as a proxy for risk as well. In this respect, the result does
not contradict the finding for the Probability of Default. Profitability of the firm (ROA) is
not significantly related to creditor concentration but it is to the Log N. For the dummy
variable indicating the legal form of the firm, irrespective of whether it is a corporation or a
partnership, we do not find strong evidence that corporations differ systematically from
partnerships with regard to concentration of borrowing.
In Panel B, we include the characteristics of the relationship lender, which is defined as
the bank with the largest financing share. The coefficients of the firm-specific variables do
not differ from the ones in Panel A. The ROA of the relationship lender is significantly
related to the dependent variable (except in the specification explaining SII). This finding is
19
also in line with the predictions in Detragiache, Garella and Guiso (2000) concerning the
liquidity problems of the relationship lender. The results imply that a one-percentage point
increase in the earnings of the relationship lender is expected to increase the HHI by 1.91
percentage points. The negative and insignificant coefficient for Capital Adequacy is
positive and significant when explaining the SII. The finding of a positive relationship is
consistent with the literature on the market discipline of banks imposed from the
borrowers' side.14 However, the impact of the coefficient needs further investigation since
we do not find the same result for other concentration measures. Moreover, it is positively
related to Log N as well. The size of the relationship bank and Risk Provisions do not have
an impact on the degree of concentration.
We also include dummies denoting the ownership structure of the bank, i.e. Public
Sector Banks, Cooperative Sector and Other Banks (banks with special functions) taking
Commercial Banks as the reference group. We find that only the coefficient of Other Banks
is positively significant when explaining Log N and the SII, implying that if the relationship
lender belongs to the group of Other Banks rather than being a commercial bank, both the
number of banks and the degree of concentration is higher. Moreover, we find that the
regional concentration of banks, HHI Region, is positively related to the firm's
concentration of borrowing but it does not have an impact on the number of banks the firm
borrows from.15
To summarize, risky, illiquid, large and leveraged firms that are located in a region with
fiercer banking competition and that are engaged with an unprofitable relationship bank,
14 In Allen, Carletti and Marquez (2005) capital acts as a commitment device to monitor borrowers. Kim,
Christiansen and Vale (2005) find that banks avoid losses as a strategic variable to soften competition.
Billett, Flannery and Garfinkel (2005) explore the effect of lenders' credit ratings on the borrowing firms'
equity returns and find evidence for a positive relationship.
15 Alternatively, we use the (Log) Number of Lenders present in a region to measure regional concentration
but do not report the results here. The estimated coefficient on this variable is negative but statistically
insignificant. All other explanatory variables remain unchanged.
20
spread their borrowing more evenly between multiple lenders. Overall, we find these results
in line with predictions in Bris and Welch (2005) and Detragiache, Garella and Guiso
(2000). We also find that similar factors affect both `the number of banks' and `the degree
of concentration'. The main difference is that asset redeployability and regional
concentration have no impact on the number of banks but a relatively strong and robust
impact on creditor concentration.
B. Role of the Relationship Lender
Next we analyze the impact of the size of the largest exposure on the sizes of other
exposures. Thus, our specification takes the form of:

(8)
where Bank Exposureijt
denotes bank lending of all banks in the sample except of the
bank with the largest exposure (these banks are, therefore, called the "other lenders") and
Largest Exposurejt
captures the exposure of the largest lender to a firm j at time t. We
assume simultaneity for the credit decisions of the relationship lender and the other lenders
as modeled by Bannier (2005) and Schuele (2006). Specification (8) captures that the
lending behavior of the other lenders may be influenced by their own characteristics (e.g.
bank size, bank fragility), by the size of the loan extended by the relationship lender to the
firm, by the characteristics of the relationship lender and by the firm characteristics. We
21
take the absolute values of exposures since the total exposures to a firm measured as
financing shares in percentages total one.
Table 7 reports the estimation results for the impact of the Largest Exposure on the
Other Exposures. Equation (8) is also estimated with fixed effects estimation techniques.
The cross-sectional unit in these estimations is the loan exposure, including information on
both firm and bank-level dimensions. The first specification, where we control for the
characteristics of the relationship lender and other lenders, indicates that a 10 percent
increase in the Largest Exposure is expected to increase Other Exposures by 5.7 percent.
Hence the other lenders seem to align their credit decisions with those of the relationship
lender. Other variables do not seem to matter for the financing decisions of other banks.
Next we include interaction terms of the Largest Exposure with the bank and market
characteristics. The last specification includes firm characteristics as well. Surprisingly, we
find that the coefficient of the Largest Exposure becomes negative and significant in the
second specification. However, the total impact of the variable is still significantly positive
when taking the interaction terms into account. The results also show that if the relationship
lender is a public bank, this has a positive impact on the size of other exposures when
compared to the case when the relationship lender is a commercial bank.
The interaction term with the (Log) Assets of other lenders has a positive coefficient
throughout the rest of the specifications. In other words, smaller banks tend to adjust their
credit decision with the financing decision of the relationship lender as long as their size
allows them to extend more credit. In addition, the interaction term of the Largest Exposure
with Capital Adequacy is negatively significant, possibly implying that as the other lenders
tie up their funds in capital their willingness to extend credit decreases. The interaction with
HHI Region is negatively related to the dependent variable but significant only at the ten
percent level and in one specification.
22
The size of the firm ((Log) Assets) is positively related to the size of the Other
Exposures as expected. Probability of Default is positively related to the dependent
variable: as predicted by Bris and Welch (2005), low quality firms do not concentrate their
borrowing as concentration may decrease their bargaining power in case of default.16 The
dummy variable for the legal form of the firm has a significantly negative coefficient,
implying that if the firm is a corporation (rather than a partnership) other lenders will tend
to lower their financing shares. We do not include the alternative set of firm-specific
variables, such as financial leverage, in order to avoid a potential endogeneity problem for
this specification since firm financial leverage might be affected by the changes in other
lenders' exposures.
As explained before, we identify the relationship lender by the size of the financing
share. Considering the presence of observations where the percentage of the largest share is
low, we re-estimate Equation 8 by excluding the observations where the share of financing
is below 20 percent and 30 percent respectively. The results are virtually unchanged.
Summarizing, the financing decision of a relationship lender is positively correlated with
the lending behavior of other banks. However, other banks seem more inclined to extend
credit the larger the exposure of the relationship lender, which is a public sector bank rather
than a commercial bank; this is particularly the case if the other banks are not small or do
not have to tie up additional funds in capital. Distressed, large or leveraged firms borrow
more from the other banks.
16 Following the model by Bris and Welch (2005), we also analyze the impact of firm quality on loan interest
rates for firms with a single lender. Since interest rate information is not available, we compute this
variable as interest rate expenses divided by financial debt of a firm minus average yields on debt
securities. We do not find any relation between Probability of Default and interest rates, possibly because
of the imprecise measurement of the loan rates.
23
V. Robustness
A. Unobserved Credit is Granted by Many Banks
To check the robustness of our results we compute the degree of concentration assuming
that the unobserved part of credit is diversified among an infinite number of banks (see
3.2.1, Equation 6). We measure the degree of concentration by the Herfindahl-Hirschman
Index (HHI) and by the Comprehensive Industrial Concentration Index (CCI)
respectively.17
Table 8 presents similar specifications as in Table 6 for the newly defined concentration
measures. The bottom-line is that changing the assumption about the unobserved part of
credit does not substantially affect our estimation results. The signs and statistical
significance for Probability of Default, Illiquid Assets and Financial Debt remain virtually
unchanged. We note, however, that the coefficient on the size of the firm variable is not
significant in Panel A. In addition, ROA Firm becomes positively significant.
The outcomes of Panel B, including bank and market-specific variables, deviate slightly
from Table 6 as well. The findings for ROA Bank, Other Banks dummy as ownership type
and HHI Region are parallel to the results of Table 6. On the other hand, the parameter for
Capital Adequacy becomes negative and significant, a result which was not observed
previously.
The bias in the degree of concentration introduced by the reporting threshold of 1.5
million Euros is possibly more pronounced for smaller firms. As an additional robustness
check, we exclude the firms with a total asset value lower than five million Euros and re-
estimate the model (but choose not to tabulate these results). As expected, the results are
17 Remember that the SII is computed by decomposing the HHI and taking out 1/Njt
. Since the number of
banks is assumed to be infinite here, 1/Njt
equals zero and the HHI equals the SII.
24
closer to our earlier findings. ROA Firm is no longer significant, and Capital Adequacy
Bank has a smaller coefficient and lower significance level. The significance of other
coefficients is unchanged and even stronger for firm-specific variables. Moreover, there is
an increase in the magnitudes of those parameters.
B. Sample Selection
Before the introduction of the euro, firms issuing commercial bills were required to report
their balance sheets to the Deutsche Bundesbank. Only firms with solid creditworthiness
were allowed to issue commercial bills. Since our data includes only firms that issued paper
and reported to the Deutsche Bundesbank, a selection bias may be present in our estimates.
To assess the average quality of the firms in our sample, we compare the mean value of
the probability of default in our sample with the values reported in Dietsch and Petey
(2004). They investigate stationary default probabilities for French and German small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from 1997 to 2001. The average PDs in both countries
are in general much lower for large businesses. For instance, the average default probability
for SMEs with turnover between one and seven million Euros equals 0.79% in their study,
while for SMEs with turnover between seven and 40 million Euros the average default
probability is only 0.14%. Our sample consists of even larger firms and the mean value of
our probability of default equals 0.60%. Consequently, it seems unlikely that only high
quality firms are present in our sample.
We further consider the fact that the number of the firms decreases over time owing to
the regulatory changes related to the introduction of the euro. Starting in 1999, commercial
bills lost their importance as securities and the number of firms reporting to the Deutsche
Bundesbank decreased commensurately. We re-estimate our model ending the sample in
25
1999. The unreported results are very similar for all firm-specific variables though not for
bank profitability and regional concentration.
C. Two- Stage Estimation
In this subsection, we follow the methodology by Detragiache, Garella and Guiso (2000)
and Guiso and Minetti (2004) by applying a two-stage estimation. The first and third
columns in both panels of Table 9 present the results for the first-stage probit estimating the
probability of multiple banking. The other columns tabulate the coefficients on the
determinants of the degree of concentration measured by the Share of Inequality Index (SII)
conditional on being in the multiple bank region. As the identification variable, we choose
the Legal Form Firm, a variable that was insignificant in the concentration estimations
using the share inequality from the previous subsection. Moreover, given previous work,
we do not have a strong reason to argue that the legal form of a firm should affect the
asymmetry in bank financing. In the second stage, we also include the Mills ratio obtained
from the first stage to correct for any selection bias.
The signs and statistical significance for most of the parameters in the second stage
remain unchanged from Table 6. Illiquid Assets is not statistically significant when
explaining the degree of concentration in Panel B. But as the first specifications of both
panels show, Illiquid Assets is positively and significantly related to the probability of
multiple banking. This result is in line with predictions in Bolton and Scharfstein (1996)
and Guiso and Minetti (2004). When including the characteristics of the bank with the
largest share, bank profitability appears to be insignificant in both stages, contradicting
previous results. The probability of multiple banking decreases with the share of risk
provisions of banks, as predicted by Detragiache, Garella and Guiso (2000) who show that
the probability of multiple banking decreases in bank fragility. However, there is little
26
evidence for a relationship between Risk Provisions and the SII. Interestingly, the dummy
for Other Banks is positively related to both probability of multiple banking and the degree
of concentration.
To summarize, large and leveraged firms and firms with less liquid assets prefer multiple
banking. Asset liquidity, however, does not have a strong impact on the degree of
concentration. Risky, large and leveraged firms with a relationship lender that is a
commercial bank choose to have lower degree of concentration in borrowing.
D. Other Robustness Tests
As an alternative linear measure for the degree of concentration, we also employ the largest
share of financing. We find three differences to the main results.18 Firstly, the size of the
firm is no longer significant. Second, the ROA of the firm positively determines the share
of financing. Thirdly, Capital Adequacy of the bank with the largest share is negatively
related to the dependent variable.19 These findings suggest that firm size matters for the
smaller shares of financing but that firm profitability and capital adequacy of the large
lender do not.
One may argue about the direction of causality between some bank-specific variables,
such as Capital Adequacy and the degree of asymmetry. When a bank extends credit, this
definitely has an impact on its capital ratio. Considering the possibility of an endogeneity
problem, we re-estimate our regressions by excluding this variable. The results confirm our
previous findings. As an alternative specification, we also include lagged bank-specific
variables. The results remain mainly unchanged except for Illiquid Assets.
18 We choose not to tabulate any further results. All estimation results in the robustness section are available
upon request.
19 These findings are similar to the results reported in Section V.A. However, recall that those results are
closer to the main results when we exclude smaller firms.
27
Next, we control for the industry affiliation of our sample firms. We choose not to
include industry affiliation in our main specifications because we lack strong theoretical
justification for doing so and because our measure is potentially noisy and incomplete. We
find that our results are not driven by industry affiliation since our previous findings are
robust to the inclusion of industry dummies.
VI. Conclusion
Motivated by seminal and more recent theoretical work, we investigate the determinants of
creditor concentration for a unique and comprehensive sample of German firms. We focus
on the degree of creditor concentration, i.e. the degree of asymmetry in the borrowing by
firms from different banks. We use alternative measures of asymmetry and conduct a
variety of other robustness exercises.
We contribute to the literature by documenting that creditor concentration is widespread
and potentially also important for large firms. Firm quality and asset redeployability is
positively related to the degree of concentration. The degree of creditor concentration
increases with the increase in the profitability of the lender with the largest financing share
and with the increase in the regional market concentration of bank lending. Other `smaller'
lenders align their credit decisions with those of the relationship lender to the extent that
their size and their capital allow them to do so. Therefore, other banks tend to extend their
lending with the increase in the exposure of the relationship lender. This tendency appears
to be stronger if the relationship bank is a public sector bank rather than a commercial bank.
Overall our study confirms hypotheses in Detragiache, Garella and Guiso (2000) and
Bris and Welch (2005) about the positive relationship between firm quality and creditor
concentration. Profitability of the relationship lender and the size of the other lenders also
play an important role. More theoretical and empirical work on creditor concentration
28
seems warranted. As direction for further research the question of interest is whether firms
adjust their creditor concentration in response to exogenous shocks. Bank mergers in the
banking industry can be considered as an exogenous shock for firms since after bank
mergers the creditor concentration automatically deviates from its original level. Therefore,
it will be interesting to investigate whether firms adjust their concentration after bank
mergers towards its optimal level which depends on their firm specific characteristics.

Table 1: Theoretical Models dealing with Borrowing Concentration
Building Blocks Mechanism Outcome Implication for Asymmetric
Financing
Bolton and Scharfstein
(1996)
· Inefficient renegotiation
with multiple creditors
following a default.
· Manager has to pay more to
stop multiple creditors from
liquidating the assets.
· Decrease in liquidation
value with multiple creditors.
Optimal for high quality firms,
those with low asset
complementarities and those with
less redeployable assets to borrow
from multiple creditors.
If the coordination problem can be
mitigated with higher asymmetry in
the financing shares of creditors, then
low quality firms, those with high
asset complementarities and those
with more redeployable assets
would have higher asymmetry in
borrowing.
Bris and Welch (2005)
· Coordination problem for
multiple creditors following a
default.
· Difficult to collect
claims.
· Concentrated creditors
spend more on lobbying and are
in a better position.
· Creditors are weaker when
dispersed.
Signalling higher firm quality
with concentrated creditors
(confidence of not going bankrupt).
An increase in asymmetry can
increase the bargaining power of
creditors (without the need to
decrease the number).
Low quality firms would prefer
multiple and symmetric bank
financing.
Detragiache, Garella and
Guiso (2000)
· Firms may diversify bank
liquidity risk.
· If refinancing from non-
relation banks is possible, no
need for multiple relationship
banking.
· Banking fragility, efficient
loan enforcement and
profitability of the investment
project affect the choice.
· Multiple banking with
less efficient loan
enforcement more likely
when banks are less fragile
and when investment projects
of the firm are not profitable.
· In the multiple region, the
number of banks increases
with profitability, with bank
fragility and the efficiency of
loan enforcement.
Non-monotonicity reflected in
asymmetry:
· Higher asymmetry (one
relationship lender and non-
relationship banks) with efficient
loan enforcement, bank fragility
and profitability.
· Lower asymmetry in the
relationship lending area.

Table 2: Structure of Relationships
This table summarizes the structure of credit relations for German firms for the period between 1993 and
2003. The number of observations is 7,699 firm-years. The first column reports the number of banks and the
second column the share of firms having relations with that particular number of banks. The following
columns report the share of loans taken by each bank ordered by size. Due to the reporting threshold in the
credit register, a considerable part of relationships cannot be observed in the sample. Panel A presents the
relationships observable in the credit register where the total share of loans is below 1. Panel B presents the
structure that is computed under the assumption that the unobserved part of the loans is concentrated in one
bank with a maximum tolerable amount of 1.499 million Euros. The third column in Panel B reports the share
of maximum exposure for firms with n banks.

Table 3: Summary Statistics for the Number of Relationships and the Degree of
Concentration
The table presents summary statistics for the number and the degree of concentration for German firms for
7,699 firm-years between 1993 and 2003. The degree of concentration is measured by the Herfindahl-
Hirschman Index (HHI) and the Horvath (1970) Comprehensive Industrial Concentration Index (CCI),
respectively. Panel A presents the relationships observable in the credit register. Panel B assumes the
unobserved part of loans to be diversified among an infinite number of banks. Panel C presents the structure
(including the number of relationships N*) that is computed under the assumption that unobserved part of
loans is concentrated in one bank with a maximum amount of 1.499 million Euros. The Share of Inequality
Index (SII) is computed for Panel C by subtracting 1/Njt from the HHI.

Appendix
A Treatment of Bank Mergers
More than one hundred bank mergers took place during the sample period. There are
different ways to handle bank mergers. We could exclude the banks that were involved in
mergers, however, this procedure would lead to a considerable loss of information.
Alternatively, we can consider the merged bank to be one institution during the entire time
period. In this case, we need to aggregate the merging banks into one institution before the
actual merger takes place. However, data breaks in this procedure are unavoidable since the
aggregated data before the merger and the data of the merged bank mostly do not
correspond well.
Given the difficulties involved in the aforementioned approaches, we choose to separate
the pre-merger banks from the merged bank. In the end, we have three banks, which are
treated independently. We repeat this procedure as often as a merger takes place. Each time
a newly merged bank receives a new identification number, we drop the target banks in that
year (or quarter). Our procedure has obvious drawbacks if one uses dynamic panel
estimation techniques.
B Details on the Matching Process of Two Databases and Data Adjustments
The data in the credit register have been primarily gathered for regulatory purposes and
some double counting may occur. We eliminate those double-counted exposures from the
sample. For example, we do not include borrower units since they report the sum of the
exposures of the firms that belong to that unit.20 Moreover, actual exposures are double
counted when partners of civil-law associations with joint partnerships or with limited
personal liability (Gesellschaften des bürgerlichen Rechts, GbR) are jointly accountable for
20 The borrower unit consists of different borrower firms. The term is defined in §19 (2) of the Banking Act.
45
the losses. In that case, the exposure of the GbR is reflected in the position of each partner
with the same amount or with the amount corresponding to the liability limit of each
partner.21 We also exclude double-counted exposures reported in partners' shares.
We match the information on the firm exposures from the credit register with the
information on the firm balance sheets from the Jalys/Ustan database. In order to carry out
the matching we use firm-specific information in the credit register and in the Jalys/Ustan.
Firm identity, location, industry and legal form allow us to match conservatively. Both
databases cover the entire time period available.22 We can identify 3,433 matches and,
using these matches, we merge the data from the credit register with the data from the
Jalys/Ustan. The data in the credit register are available on a quarterly basis, and the data
from the Jalys/Ustan are available on a monthly basis where the balance sheet disclosure
occurs once a year in a particular month of that year. The majority of the firms report their
balance sheets at the end of the year. To avoid the problem of time mismatches for firms
that have different balance sheet periods, we match the quarterly data from the credit
register with the last month of each quarter of firm data from the Jalys/Ustan.
Additionally, we make some data adjustments. We compute a coverage ratio between
the two databases and exclude observations with a coverage ratio above 120 percent.23 The
coverage ratio is calculated as follows:
1
(( ) / )*100
n
jt ijt jt
i
Coverage Ratio Loans Financial Firm Liabilities
=
= ¦ , (A1)
21 For more detailed information on the civil-law associations and the liability limits, see Deutsche
Bundesbank (1998).
22 The data in the credit register are available for 1993 onwards and the data in the Jalys/Ustan from 1989
onwards.
23 The aim is to exclude the observations with a coverage ratio above 100 percent to eliminate data recording
errors. However, we choose a tolerance level of 120 percent and correct the data for the degree of
asymmetry measure.

Table A2 presents the distribution of the number of firms over the years in the sample
including the process of data adjustment. The number of firms diminishes over time with
the introduction of the euro. Before the introduction of the euro, firms issuing commercial
bills were required to report their balance sheets to the Deutsche Bundesbank since only
firms with a solid creditworthiness were allowed to issue these commercial bills. With the
introduction of the euro, commercial bills lost their importance as securities and the number
of firms reporting to the Deutsche Bundesbank decreased commensurately.
