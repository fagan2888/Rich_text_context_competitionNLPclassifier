Introduction
We begin with the contextual practices that communities per-
form to define the types of learning and knowing to study the
practices that engage individuals with the social world to
develop, share, and maintain knowledge evolve over time
(Collins, 2006; Enyedy & Goldberg, 2004). For example, in
professional science communities, scientists perform their
contextual practices to generate new knowledge, and scien-
tists-in-the-making develop ideas, goals, and plans to con-
tinue to do scientific practice. On the contrary, in most
schools, science classroom communities' practices are
viewed as the safe version of scientists' practices performed
in their communities (Archer et al., 2010). In addition, we
recognize that there are classroom science practices unre-
lated to practices of scientists in research laboratories (Chinn
& Malhotra, 2002; Hofstein & Lunetta, 2004), such as cur-
riculum objectives, standards, and standardized testing.
These practices may discourage students to learn from
authentic tasks relevant to real-world problems (Höngström,
Ottander, & Benckert, 2010) and do not reflect the social
nature of practice that encompasses commitment, uncer-
tainty, peer review, and so on (Bricker & Bell, 2008).
Thus, our premise is that the practices of science and the
practices of the science classroom are divergent with dis-
similar social contexts. To understand these science class-
room practices, we asked the following research questions to
explore the socio-cultural practices and interactions of learn-
ing science in a science classroom to identify the normative
school science practices, interactional patterns, and power
relations:
Research Question 1: What are the students' science
practices?
Research Question 2: What is the nature of the "partici-
pant structures" that emerged within the scientific
events the students performed?

Abstract
The purpose of this study was to explore the socio-cultural practices and interactions of learning science in a science
classroom within the concept of communities of practice. Our qualitative data were collected through observing, taking
field notes, and conducting interviews in a public science classroom during an entire school year. The study occurred in
a seventh-grade classroom with a veteran physical science teacher, with more than 10 years teaching experience, and 22
students. For this article, we presented two classroom vignettes that reflect a sample of the participation, practice, and
community that was observed in the science classroom on a daily basis. The first vignette illustrated a typical formula of
Initiation­Response­Feedback (I-R-F) that transfers knowledge to students through a teacher-led discussion with the entire
class. The second vignette described a laboratory activity designed to allow students to apply or discover knowledge through
practical experience, while taking responsibility for their learning through small-group work. The normative practices and
routine behaviors of the science classroom are highlighted through the description of material resources, and different
modes of participation accompanied by assigned roles and responsibilities. What we observed was that laboratory activities
reproduced the epistemic authority of the I-R-F rather than creating collective cognitive responsibility where students have
the independence to explore and create authentic science experiences.

Research Question 3: What dimensions of the communi-
ties of practice emerge within these events?
The article begins with a discussion of the meaning of
communities of practice in relation to the social structure
of a typical science classroom. We address these communi-
ties of practice to focus on the group behaviors versus indi-
viduals. After a discussion of the methodology, we present
and analyze two vignettes that illustrate observed class-
room members' engagement and interaction in two differ-
ent contexts: lecture and laboratory. The discussion of our
findings outlines the social dynamics that trigger and hin-
der the formation of a classroom community of practice
within a science classroom. Our findings are important for
designing learning environments aimed to cultivate sci-
ence learning through participation, belonging, and prac-
tice, in ways that might mimic professional scientific
communities of practice or foster learning through
discovery.
Theoretical Framework
School Science Classroom and Its Social Structure
Our study will use a socio-cultural approach to provide an
understanding of the social and cultural systems of class-
rooms and students' classroom involvement (Kozulin,
Gindis, Ageyev, & Miller, 2003). Within a classroom culture,
members construct social norms and rules as they develop
different roles and establish relationships among themselves
and participant identities (Collins, 2006). The social author-
ity and epistemic role of the teacher contribute to the con-
figuration of the classroom culture by organizing and
managing normative classroom practices, and in establishing
interactions (Bauchspies, 2005).
Conflicts, tensions, and disagreements are central to form
and sustain a classroom community of practice and are cen-
tral to this study for understanding the emergence or absence
of a community of practice within a science classroom
(Wenger, 1998). Individuals develop common knowledge
through sharing and negotiating their understanding and
experience with each other in most classrooms (Elbers &
Streefland, 2000). They may encounter conflicts with other
students or resistance to their ideas, thoughts, and claims
when engaged in activities with a discussion component
(Olitsky, Flohr, Gardner, & Billups, 2010; Oliveira & Sadler,
2008). When this occurs, these temporally emergent circum-
stances are accommodated through the social interactions
and negotiations among the classroom members (Mortimer
& Scott, 2003). This study will focus on these temporal
emergent circumstances because they lead to a shared reper-
toire among the members and help develop individual roles
and identities (Olitsky et al., 2010).
Philips (1972) coined the term "participant structures" as
the context of participants' engagement, their social norms,
relationships, roles, and responsibilities, and the materials
and knowledge acquisition. We analyze and articulate the
social structure of a science classroom using "participant
structures" to explain (a) how class members participate in
and sustain their practices, (b) what roles the teacher and the
students are engaged in, (c) what relationships they establish
in maintaining memberships, and (d) what types of resources
are shared and generated (Cornelius & Herrenkohl, 2004;
Tabak & Baumgartner, 2004).
A community of practice encompasses three indicators--
mutual engagement, joint enterprise, and shared repertoire
(Wenger, 1998). Mutual engagement is attributed to mem-
bership, diversity, and relationship within a community that
creates a joint enterprise among the members:
The enterprise is the result of a collective process of negotiation
that reflects the complexity of mutual engagement. It is not just
a stated goal, but creates among participants relations of mutual
accountability that become an integral part of the practice.
(Wenger, 1998, pp. 77-78)
This in turn creates a shared repertoire as a set of resources,
including routines, ways of doing things, words, tools,
actions, concepts, or discourse that the community members
use and/or produce to sustain their memberships in a
community.
Central to a community of practice are participation and
identity transformation (Wenger, 1998). Participation is a
catalyst to developing and sustaining a community of prac-
tice in a way that shapes members' actions and identities.
Participation is not limited to engaging in activities; it is also
a process of becoming a full participant. In this sense, Roth
(1998) suggested that students be encouraged to engage in
authentic tasks in a community of classroom practice in
which a novice learner or a newcomer adopts and uses a
classroom community's norms and beliefs to become a full
member of that community as opposed to grades and exams
emphasized in most conventional classrooms (Barab &
Duffy, 2000). Identity transformation occurs in the context of
becoming a full member in a community. Individuals at dif-
ferent levels of participation and membership become famil-
iar with and use knowledge, and master skills of a community
through their personal trajectories of participation (Clark,
2005). In the classroom context, a student learns as she
develops and transforms her identity through her personal
trajectories of participation in a shared school science
practice.
Researchers have been interested in developing a com-
munity of practice in educational settings (Aguilar, 2009;
Clark, 2005). They examine the elements of communities of
practice and use communities of practice as a framework to
understand how individuals learn. Yet, there are a few studies
that explore and document the potential dynamics that deter-
mine whether or not a community of practice emerges within
school settings, and how it does or does not emerge (Aguilar,
Ayar et al. 3
2009; Olitsky, 2007; Roth, McGinn, Woszczyna, &
Boutonne, 1999).
Aguilar (2009) has identified students' learning in school
science context by addressing the three interrelated con-
structs: (a) mutual engagement, (b) joint enterprise, and (c)
shared repertoire. In her model, knowledge transmission by
the teacher and non-participations of the students was a bar-
rier to the development of a classroom community of prac-
tice. Whereas Olitsky (2007) observed that different types of
interactional events (e.g., one-on-one and whole-class) are a
means to increase student engagement and student learning
as well as to form a classroom community of practice, Roth
et al. (1999), in contrast, found that a small number of stu-
dents participated in science classroom discourse practices,
although students were provided with the opportunity to
develop their own artifacts through different levels of social
configuration (e.g., whole class and small group).
In this study, we contribute to this line of inquiry with a
study of learning and teaching science in a seventh-grade sci-
ence classroom by highlighting the normative school science
practices, interactional patterns among members of the class-
room, power relations, and cultural portrait of the classroom.
To address these issues, we examine the elements of the
classroom's community of practice.
Method
The Setting
This ethnographic study was conducted in a public school
classroom in North America. With one class for each grade
level, the school hosted approximately 250 students in kin-
dergarten through 12th grade in the same building. The
school served a middle-class neighborhood in mid-sized
community located nearby a major university. Several
schools in the targeted community were approached and this
one self-selected itself to be the focus of this study. The 7th-
grade classroom, which is the focus of this study, had 22 stu-
dents at the ages of 13 and 14. Of the 22 students (7 males
and 15 females), around 18% were African American, 36%
were HispanicAmerican, and 46% were EuropeanAmerican.
Its racial breakdown was representative of the community.
Ms. Corbin1 was the certified physical science teacher.
She has been teaching seventh- and eighth-grade science
courses in the middle school and physics, biology, and chem-
istry courses in the high school over 10 years. For the last 3
years, Ms. Corbin has been organizing and supervising in-
and out-school activities relevant to physical sciences.
During the year of observation, she used the science curricu-
lum that conformed to the state's science standards.
Data Collection and Analysis
This study was conducted in one science classroom to
develop a "thick" description of the community of practice
within it. Specifically, our aim was to determine the social
dynamics that support or hinder the emergence of a commu-
nity of practice in the school science context via normative
school science practices, interactional patterns, and power
relations.
Participant observation method was employed to thor-
oughly explore students' behaviors and actions during the
classroom cultural activities (Spradley, 1980). The first
author closely engaged with the teacher and the students in
the classroom for an academic year. During laboratory activ-
ities, the investigator interacted with students in groups and
one-on-one and sometimes participated in labs as a member
of the team. During these interactions, the investigator asked
the students both rhetorical and literal questions to document
what they thought they were doing in the laboratory
activity.
The observer's role in class changed over time from a pas-
sive participant role to an intermediate participant role. He
maintained the balance "between being an insider and an
outsider, between participation and observation" (Spradley,
1980, p. 60) by gradually adjusting his participation in the
activities and timing his questions to the activity. This strat-
egy allowed him to capture the local occurrences in the class-
room. As a participant observer, the investigator supervised
the students' extracurricular science fair projects at the
request of students and the teacher. In his role as the science
fair supervisor, he offered support to students' projects but
abstained from directing their projects.
Observation notes were made during visits and daily jour-
nal entries provided additional details. The field notes and
daily journal included classroom observations and the
observer's self-reflections about the events of the classroom.
They also included notes on conversations with the students
and Ms. Corbin in and outside of formal classroom activities.
Formal interviews were recorded and transcribed.
Two data analysis methods were employed: (a) the ethno-
graphic data analysis method (Spradley, 1980) and (b) the
constant-comparative method (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) to
analyze data collected through participant observation and
interviews, respectively. Interviews were transcribed verba-
tim. Interview transcripts and participant observations were
merged with the daily journals and artifacts (e.g., handouts,
student presentations, and quiz or test sheets) to identify nor-
mative school science practices, interactional patterns, and
power relations.
Vignette 1: Presenting, receiving, and reproducing ready-
made scientific facts
The focus of the lesson is a quiz about deoxyribo nucleic acid
(DNA) base pairing. Before the quiz, Ms. Corbin has stu-
dents recall DNAstructure, and in their words, it is a "twisted
ladder," while the teacher uses its technical term "double
helix." Ms. Corbin distributes quiz sheets. Each sheet has
different samples of DNAstructure. Meanwhile, she instructs
4 SAGE Open
her students that they can gain extra credit if they write the
names of four bases correctly. Tim responds to her by asking,
"What if I misspell the names of the bases" because "the
names of bases are not so familiar to me, and they sound like
technical terms." Ms. Corbin answers him by speaking to the
entire class, "Unless there are major misspellings, you will
get credit." At this point, she gives students 3 min to com-
plete their quiz.
When students finish the quiz, Ms. Corbin picks a DNA
sequence sample from the quiz and writes it on the white-
board. She asks students, "What does Adenine (A) pair up
with?" One student responds, "A pairs up with Thymine
(T)." Ms. Corbin continues to ask, "What does Cytosine (C)
pair up with?" Another student tells, "Guanine (G)," and so
on. When Ms. Corbin and students have finished to pair up
the four bases (A, T, G, S), she lists and writes down the
names of four bases on the whiteboard. At the same time,
students self-check whether the names of four bases are writ-
ten correctly on their quiz sheet. Yet, the teacher does not
grade students' quiz nor are they recorded in her gradebook.
After students put the quiz away, Ms. Corbin moves on to the
next activity.
Ms. Corbin asks the students, "How does DNA determine
your traits?" She writes DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) on
the whiteboard. She asks first, "What does DNA stand for?"
Tom says, "Deoxyribonucleic acid." Then Ms. Corbin
explains that the only difference between DNA and RNA is
deoxy, which RNA does not have. Therefore, RNA stands for
ribonucleic acid. She jots down the full names of DNA and
RNA on the whiteboard. She asks the students to recall the
four bases in DNA. They express and list four bases--A, T,
C, and G. She immediately interjects, "RNA does not have T
base; instead, it has Uracil (U) along with other three bases."
By using recall and reminding techniques, Ms. Corbin
describes DNA, mRNA, and tRNA, and notes their traits on
the whiteboard. Meanwhile, the students are busy with writ-
ing notes about RNA and its four bases in their notebooks.
Then, she asks them to get a clean sheet of paper and instructs
them to "Flip your paper in half vertically and then flip the
other half in half again. You will have four columns."
Meanwhile, she walks around and surveys whether students
have it as she has instructed. She is back to the whiteboard
and writes a sample of DNA sequence--CATGCTAAT--on
the whiteboard. She instructs the students to label four col-
umns with headings: mRNA, tRNA, protein, and traits. She
has them note that mRNA is a messenger RNA; tRNA is
transfer RNA.
Ms. Corbin explains, "C in DNA sequence pairs up with
G in mRNA." She asks Danielle, "A in DNA pairs up with
what?" to which Danielle hesitantly says, "U?" Meanwhile,
other classroom members are insistently holding their hands
up to get permission to answer this question. Ms. Corbin
reminds everyone, "RNA does not have T base; instead it has
Uracil." She marks it with a star on the whiteboard. She con-
tinues by questioning the class with "T in DNA sequence
pairs up with what?" She goes through a sample of DNA
sequence by pairing up the bases in mRNA and tRNA. Every
time, she points to the U base in the RNA sequence.
When the students finish pairing up bases, Ms. Corbin
asks them to look up the information provided in their activ-
ity sheet to identify protein codes based upon triple bases in
the mRNA sequence. When there is no response from them,
Ms. Corbin adds, "GUA sequence is called Valine according
to the information in the activity sheet" and "CGU sequence
is Arginine and UUA sequence is Leucine." She finishes
with "these are the types of amino acids." Ms. Corbin encour-
ages students to imagine the whole sequence of DNA and its
counterparts in mRNAand tRNAsequences by what kinds of
amino acid are produced. When students do not answer, she
answers for them with, "If we consider the whole sequence
of amino acid, then it looks like hitchhiker's thumb."
Vignette 2: Learning by doing some practical works
On one Monday afternoon, Ms. Corbin starts the class by
telling students, "We will have a lab activity about the physi-
cal and chemical changes." A whisper of "YES" is heard
softly echoing among the students. Before the lab activity
starts, Ms. Corbin calls out the names of each lab group.
Recently, she reconfigured them based on academic perfor-
mance, behaviors, and gender. Each group has a designated
leader assigned by the teacher and is typically the student
with a strong academic performance. The group recorder is
selected by the group leader.
Students rearrange themselves into their laboratory
groups. Ms. Corbin distributes laboratory sheets to six groups
of four students. She reads the first page of the laboratory
sheet where lab purpose, procedures, and materials are listed.
While Ms. Corbin reads the procedure section, she points to
the materials and equipment that the students will be using.
Then, she assigns one student in the classroom to read out
loud for the class the rest of the laboratory sheet.
While students hold up their hands to volunteer to read it,
she selects Beril who does not have her hands up and is qui-
etly reading a novel. Beril reads the entire lab instruction step
by step. When she finishes reading it, Ms. Corbin instructs
one student from each group to collect goggles and gloves,
while another student gets test tubes, chemical substances,
spatula, and pestle. Students assigned to obtain the experi-
ment materials move next to the bench where Ms. Corbin has
located the equipment and the substances. At the bench, they
talk to each other about which equipment they will need,
how many test tubes they will use, and which substances
they will first use.
Today's laboratory activity is composed of five mini
investigations about physical and chemical changes. In one
group, Julie as the designated group leader asks who will do
which investigation. At that moment, each member looks at
the possibilities and self-selects an assignment. Julie domi-
nates the group and assigns herself as a recorder even though
Ayar et al. 5
Terri self-selects herself to be a recorder. Terri and other stu-
dents in the group wordlessly acquiesce to Julie. As the
leader Julie asks the group members' thoughts and ideas
before she writes the group's findings. She puts forward her
thoughts and ideas when other students do not share their
ideas and thoughts; the other members simply agree with no
discussion. At the end of the laboratory sheet, Julie again
provides the answers for the group to write them down. The
group agrees with her and accepts Julie's final statements
without discussing their observations or conclusion from
each investigation.
While each group is busy conducting the experiments and
identifying the physical and chemical changes, Ms. Corbin
stops by each group, checks what group members are doing,
and asks them, "What stage are you at?" She continues to
monitor the groups, while some group members ask for help
to answer a question about the procedures and their investi-
gations. She provides guidance. As necessary, she answers
the questions directly. At other times, she responds with a
question to allow them think and discuss in groups.
When Ms. Corbin realizes that students completed the
activities on the first page of the laboratory sheet, she asks
them to continue on the second page where they will record
their observations in a chart and explain whether the changes
in matters are physical or chemical. Each group finishes
experimenting, recording observations, identifying physical
and chemical changes, and answering questions on the labo-
ratory sheet. Ms. Corbin asks the groups to discuss similari-
ties and differences between the physical and chemical
changes in another worksheet. She picks Kevin to give an
example, and Kevin suggests that eroding is a physical
change. Another student, Rena, disagrees with Kevin's
example because she thinks that it is a chemical change. At
that moment, some students agree with Rena and some do
not. Ms. Corbin encourages the students to provide evidence
and to explain why it is physical change or not. Disagreement
on that example lasts a while and then is resolved by Ms.
Corbin. She concludes, "I think that eroding is an example
for both physical and chemical changes." Ms. Corbin and her
students continue discussing other examples regarding
chemical and physical changes until the bell rings.
Findings
Student Science Practices
In the seventh-grade science classroom, Ms. Corbin's nor-
mative practices were to set the agenda and orchestrate both
regular classroom and laboratory activities. As a knowledge
transmitter and a source of knowledge, she used the power of
knowing and the authority to determine, plan, organize, and
implement the everyday activities of the classroom. In the
interviews, several students described the teacher's role as
the director and knower:
Ms. Corbin determined what activities we would do and why we
will do those. She determined them because almost everyone in
the class can participate in them and understand what's going
on. (Student 2)
She [The teacher] hands us worksheets. And we know she has
more knowledge and experience than us. (Student 1)
Ms. Corbin used a computer and a projector in the class-
room that gave her access to for Microsoft office program
applications (e.g., word processing and Power Points) and
the Internet. She used these technologies to present knowl-
edge and to implement instructional activities. For example,
the teacher used the projector to exhibit the picture of chro-
mosomes to enable students to imagine and conceptualize
how and under what conditions people are born with Down's
syndrome. The projector was a tool for her to draw students'
attention to the topic and concentrate on the picture dis-
played. The computer and its accessories are technologies of
direction used by the teacher to monitor student's readiness
to quizzes and exams as well as to disseminate ideas, con-
cepts, and terms easily.
In other lessons, the computer and projector were used by
students to share their projects with the classroom. Students
had projects to present over two semesters. Although some
groups preferred making a poster, some groups prepared
PowerPoint presentations with animations and visual effects
to draw their peer's attention. Again the computer and pro-
jector are being used as a technology of direction, this time
by the students within the classroom. The technologies were
used in similar ways by the classroom community to facili-
tate teaching and repetition of scientific concepts as a recog-
nized social practice of the classroom.
In addition, Ms. Corbin prepared handouts and used them
to guide and support student learning. Handouts in-class
activities included worksheets, quiz sheets, and course notes.
These handouts pertained to knowledge presented in their
science textbook. These paper technologies reinforced the
teacher's role of director and knower and rarely shifted those
roles to the students. One student summarized this in her
interview:
In our class we usually get worksheets or lab experiments or
something like that or either our teacher or book would provide
the correct answer or a correct possibility or any possibilities,
but in unknown answer--I wouldn't really expect that . . .
As illustrated in the second vignette, students were pro-
vided with laboratory handouts. These handouts listed the
purpose, the procedures, and the materials. The students
were also provided with laboratory materials and equipment
(e.g., microscope, pH meters, gas pressure sensors, and bal-
ance) to conduct their scientific investigations and complete
their lab assignments. These material resources were the
shared repertoire in the classroom community where the
6 SAGE Open
students performed both in-class and lab activities to learn
scientific concepts. They too reinforced the role of students
as actors who follow the guidance of the director or teacher.
Ms. Corbin preferred using the Initiation­Response­
Evaluation (I-R-E) and Initiation­Response­Feedback (I-
R-F) interactional sequences. That is, she preferred initiating
a question about a term, students responded to that question,
and then she evaluated their response or provided feedback
(Mortimer & Scott, 2003). She used these question­answer
routines between her and students to coordinate the regular
classroom activities as exemplified in the first vignette. For
students, however, they responded to the I-R-E or I-R-F
strategy as another version of listen, receive knowledge, and
take notes.
In the second vignette, students are observed being more
actively engaged with knowledge production through labora-
tory activities to recall and verify knowledge. Students are
also asked to apply that knowledge and develop inquiry
skills to complete the laboratory activity. Typically, the lab
activities were simple hands-on activities that the students
completed by following the prescribed procedures (Chinn &
Malhotra, 2002). Meanwhile, Ms. Corbin maintained her
role as a director by provided feedback, monitored their per-
formance, and mentored them (Tabak & Baumgartner, 2004).
In this classroom, the students were expected to work in
assigned groups and to accomplish their task in a collective
manner. Some students dominated the group's work to
accomplish their normative laboratory practices. Other stu-
dents took the responsibilities designated by their group
leader mostly and rarely by their self-choice. As part of her
normative practices, Ms. Corbin intended to form diverse
student groups in regard to sex, behavior, and academic per-
formance every several weeks. She organized pair and small
groups to regulate the laboratory activities where students
were expected to work in groups. Ms. Corbin always moni-
tored the students'group work as to whether they were work-
ing together or not. She encouraged them to work together
for the completion of the activities. Working together was a
tacit and invisible norm during the laboratory activities that
was constantly reinforced by the teacher's verbal and non-
verbal clues.
Different students responded differently to the assigned
groups because of pre-existing relationships within the class-
room from several years of going to school together. One
student explained the group's dynamics from a historical
perspective:
. . . We're a pretty hardworking class, although we know how to
get on--on the teacher's bad sides. We've been doing that for
years though so--but you know, we can work well if uh . . .
hmm, we're in the right groups. We all know each other pretty
well because we've been in this school for more than one year in
most cases. (Student 2)
Another student characterized the dynamics from a social
grouping perspective:
The ways the groups are made usually depend. If I were in a
group with not my friends, then we probably would have been
assigning stuff that each person brings, but when I'm with my
friends, we kind of just take the responsibility ourselves without
assigning it. (Student 5)
By focusing on the normative practices and routine behav-
iors of the classroom, we see that community of practice is
centered on the teacher as a director. Whereas students'com-
munity of practice either follows the direction of the teacher
or illustrates autonomy when assigned groups overlap with
social groupings that exist outside of the classroom.
The Nature of the "Participant Structures" in the
Science Classroom
Ms. Corbin established different modes of participation to
support students' participation in their everyday activities:
(a) individual mode, (b) pair mode, (c) small-group mode,
and (d) whole-class mode.
By individual mode of participation, we refer to the inter-
actions between a student and a teacher (Philips, 1972). In
this type of participation, all students worked individually
under Ms. Corbin's guidance on an assignment. Ms. Corbin
acted as an authority figure, and checked and controlled the
students' behaviors and attitudes to teach scientific topics.
Students were encouraged to ask questions if anything was
not clear to them. When the students had questions, they
called on Ms. Corbin as the expert or authority who was
responsible to respond to their inquiries. This individual
mode of participation defined the students as receiving
objects (Freire, 2000).
Pair mode of participation can be attributed to the interac-
tions between two students under Ms. Corbin's guidance.
Students in pairs shared their understanding, experience,
knowledge, competence, and responsibilities. In the mean-
time, Ms. Corbin was in the role of facilitating. When a pair
group had a conflict or a disagreement, Ms. Corbin helped
them out through feedback. The pair mode of participation
occurred as students were engaged with both the regular
classroom and laboratory activities. For example, when
designing a solar oven model as a project work, Ms. Corbin
set pairs who would decide their own best model to cook
something. The students were encouraged to negotiate how
to design a model, what kind of materials they would use,
and how to use the model to conduct their investigations.
While the students were the center of action and discussed
each step to design the model by sharing their ideas, Ms.
Corbin monitored each group, provided feedback, and
checked their performance. Students in pairs acted in a col-
laborative manner as they mutually communicated their
ideas with each other and shared with each other their knowl-
edge and the experience that helped them accomplish their
assignment. In addition, they were in symmetric interactions
where no one dominated their conversation, which in turn

developed the sense of ownership of the model they designed
(Oliveira, Sadler, & Suslak, 2007; Tabak & Baumgartner,
2004). This pair mode of participation defined the students as
acting, collaborating, and sharing individuals.
Small-group mode of participation is one in which stu-
dents work in a small group with more distant teacher super-
vision (Philips, 1972). In this type of participation, Ms.
Corbin was in the role of mentoring each group and support-
ing their articulation of ideas among the students in each
group (Tabak & Baumgartner, 2004). Ms. Corbin frequently
initiated the small-group mode of participation when the stu-
dents frequently performed laboratory activities as illustrated
in the second vignette. Given that the students were the cen-
ter of action, they were responsible for doing their own
investigations. To accomplish their lab assignment, they
were provided with the opportunity to determine the division
of labor in each group. Although they were not urged to be in
the pursuit of the unknown, they worked and completed lab
assignment collectively, and negotiated their conflicts and
disagreements with regard to investigations, observations,
and findings. In turn, their mutual negotiations led to trans-
forming their disagreements into agreements. This small-
group mode of participation defined the students as more
acting, engaging, collaborating, and sharing individuals.
Whole-class mode of participation can be attributed to the
teacher-initiated whole-class interaction where the teacher
dominates her social and epistemic authority to orchestrate
the classroom practices and maintain continuous science
learning (Turpen & Finkelstein, 2010). In the whole-class
mode of participation, Ms. Corbin was the center of action;
therefore, she established asymmetric interactions with the
students. She was in the role of leading conversations, trans-
mitting knowledge to the students, and motivating the mar-
ginal students to engage in discussions through asking
rhetorical and literal questions. In the meantime, many stu-
dents voluntarily participated, listened to her, and rarely
raised questions as shown in the first vignette. Ms. Corbin
preferred to employ the I-R-F sequence to manage the whole-
class interactions. The I-R-F sequence motivated students to
participate in a conversation and discuss scientific concepts.
Yet, the I-R-E sequence existed when students were engaged
with question­answer routine activities. This whole-class
mode of participation defined the students as more receiving
and less engaging individuals.
Dimensions of Communities of Practice in the
Science Classroom
Our study findings reveal practice, participation, and com-
munity in the science classroom, as dimensions of communi-
ties of practice. Practices that the students performed in the
classroom consisted of regular class and laboratory activities
to become familiar with science subject-matter. Rarely, they
were provided with open-ended activities (e.g., designing a
solar oven model) to make connections to their daily life.
Participation structures that we observed were organized
by the teacher depending on the nature of their normative
practices. The individual mode of participation and the
whole-class mode of participation were to enhance the indi-
vidualistic learning through the questions­answer routine
works (Lemke, 1990). The individual mode of participation
restricted the students to interact and communicate with the
other classroom members because they were only in contact
with the teacher. The pair mode of participation and the
small-group mode of participation provided students with
the opportunity to be the center of action, establish different
roles, share responsibilities to perform their contextual prac-
tices, and develop a collective understanding of a shared
practice. In other words, they were given a chance to become
more active in a way that encourages them to move from
being a peripheral participant to being a full participant
(Wenger, 1998). In turn, this can allow identity transforma-
tions as their participation level changes and they engage in
a shared practice.
We construe community with power relations, authority,
and belonging. In this study, the seventh-grade students
accepted and internalized that their teacher was the one who
plans, organizes, and implements their classroom practices
as well as initiates their common goals (e.g., particularly
learning and memorizing scientific concepts, having fun, and
being successful in science exams) through her power and
authority as a component of classroom life (Pace &
Hemmings, 2007). Power relations between the teacher and
the students were stable. It was already given to the teacher
(Bauchspies, 2005; Oliveira, 2010). Students intended to
work with their close friends when they were formed in
groups because they had common histories and were aware
of their good and bad sides. The teacher's epistemic and
social authority played a role in configuring various student
groups in regard to their academic background, sex, and
behaviors. This was discouraging for students to have a feel-
ing of belonging to a group in a specific, and a classroom
community in general.
Discussion and Implications
This study has illustrated the normative practices and power
relations occurring in two teaching formats for science:
I-R-E or I-R-F instructional sequences and small-group labo-
ratory activities share an epistemic authority that limits the
participatory potential of both activities.
In the first vignette, the teacher guides and directs student
learning as she reinforces and introduces science concepts.
She controls learning activities in a directive manner that
facilitates one-on-one conversation between student and
teacher and rarely between student and student. After the
teacher places students into groups, the identified leader acts
as a teacher and the group members participate in their nor-
mal default role of learners. We see this in the student leader
who dominated her group's discussion, assigned roles to her
8 SAGE Open
peers, and offered answers to all questions to complete their
lab investigations. Thus, the "academic leader of the group"
accepts the responsibility and finishes their collective job to
maintain her status as leader. Meanwhile, the rest of the
group maintain their normal role as learners and do not dis-
cuss their observations or results with one another, which
reinforces that science discourse is structured by I-R-E or
I-R-F sequences. This is supported by studies of what occurs
when scientists and students collaborate: The leading scien-
tist typically takes the teacher's role in working with students
(Charney et al., 2007).
Laboratory investigations in the classroom are a means
for students to conceptualize the subject-matter that is pre-
sented during lectures: I-R-E or I-R-F. Lab activities are
designed to give students the chance to learn independently
or with peers. In the second vignette, we see the students
reproducing I-R-F at the end of the lab activity rather than
discussing among themselves. The classroom's default mode
or established participatory structures shaped the community
of practice and limited the development of practices that may
have encouraged discussion across groups.
In the second vignette, teacher authority was given to stu-
dents via their assigned roles and responsibilities. The selec-
tion of a student leader based on academic performance gave
epistemic authority to only one student, while placing the
remaining students in their habitual normative role as learn-
ers. The laboratory activity of Vignette 2 gave students
responsibility and created a division of labor that mimicked
the authority and normative practices of Vignette 1. Whereas
the teacher performs her role in an authoritative role, the stu-
dent leaders perform theirs in an authoritarian manner. This
directly challenges the idea that laboratory activities engage
students with hands-on learning that enables them to under-
stand and learn science concepts differently from a lecture or
class discussion. Our observation and comparison of two
typical activities in this science classroom ethnography
through the lens of normative practices and participatory
modes illustrate the importance of describing the socio-cul-
tural aspects of the school science classroom to understand
not only the individual practices of students and teachers but
what their communities of practice are creating and repro-
ducing daily.
Conclusion
In this article, we drew on two vignettes to (a) reflect the
nature of school science practices, (b) shed light on the inter-
action and communication structures between students and
the teacher, (c) depict how the teacher organizes and man-
ages normative classroom practices for students to under-
stand scientific concepts, and (d) identify the social dynamics
that hinder or trigger the formation of a community of prac-
tice in the science classroom.
The students were engaged in regular classroom activities
(e.g., completing worksheets and assignments through the
teacher's knowledge, going over handouts and having mini
discussions, and taking quizzes and exams). Research has
shown how these "regular classroom activities" produce sta-
ble practices that reinforce the goal of higher exam scores
(Zakharov, Carnoy, & Loyalka, 2014). During laboratory
activities designed to give students intimacy with scientific
knowledge, concepts, terms, and natural phenomena, stu-
dents were observed establishing social relationships pat-
terned using I-R-F that defined their laboratory experiences.
Although the teacher provided different participation modes
designed to enhance student engagement in activities, social
and epistemic authority were not redistributed or altered for
activities presumed to develop a norm based on collabora-
tion. The power dynamics that created the student working
groups reproduced itself within the groups and affected how
students worked together. What we observed was that labo-
ratory activities reproduced the epistemic authority of the
I-R-F rather than creating collective cognitive responsibility
where students have the independence to explore and to cre-
ate authentic science experiences.
Thus, barriers and triggers to a community of practice co-
exist in the science classroom from the teacher's authority to
worksheets and laboratory equipment. On one hand, we
identified that the teacher's institutionalized role, namely her
epistemic and social authority, influenced students' actions,
behaviors, and learning activities. At times, this institutional
role was a trigger for community of practice in doing work-
sheets or taking quizzes. However, it was also seen as a bar-
rier to the formation of a community of practice in the
laboratory activities. The configuration of working groups
based on teacher authority worked as a barrier to developing
a collaborative community of practice for students to work
collectively as a group. On the other hand, these student
groups reinforced the role of the academically strong and
weak in their participation in laboratory activity. Students
continued to engage, collaborate, and share their ideas and
thoughts with others in their established roles within I-R-F.
Therefore, this study highlights the importance of the social
context and dynamics operating within the science class-
room community of practice where practices can trigger or
hinder an unintended norm to be reproduced and reinforced,
regardless of intended norm.
