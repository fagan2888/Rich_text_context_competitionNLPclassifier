Introduction
Primary aldosteronism (PA), one of the most frequent
causes of secondary hypertension, is caused by over-
secretion of aldosterone. It has attracted increased atten-
tion in recent studies because its prevalence among
secondary hypertension subjects is greater than previous
estimates, about 5­13% of hypertensive patients of any
causes.1 It has been suggested by several clinical studies
that aldosterone itself could cause cardiovascular injuries
by mechanisms other than sodium-water retention or
hypertensive effects.2­4 Some investigations suggest that
aldosterone is associated with arterial stiffness and
endothelial dysfunction, which may lead to atherosclero-
sis or other cardiovascular complications.5­8 In our previ-
ous study, we demonstrated that PA patients have a higher
degree of early atherosclerosis and vascular stiffness, and

Abstract
Introduction: Hypokalemia in primary aldosteronism (PA) patients correlates with higher levels of cardiovascular events
and altered left ventricular geometry. However, the influence of aldosterone on microvascular endothelial function and
the effect of hypokalemia on the vascular structure still remain unclear.
Objectives: We investigated the peripheral arterial functions, including the endothelial function of microvasculature and
arterial stiffness in PA and essential hypertension (EH) patients, and the correlation between hypokalemia and peripheral
arterial function among PA patients.
Methods: Twenty patients diagnosed as EH and 37 patients with PA were enrolled in this study. Reactive hyperemia
index (RHI) and the augmentation index (AI) were obtained by non-invasive peripheral arterial tonometry.
Results: Twenty EH patients and a total of 37 PA patients, including 21 patients with normokalemia and 16 patients
with hypokalemia, were enrolled and divided into groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. PA patients had significantly higher
AI (p=0.024) but not RHI than EH patients. RHI showed no difference between groups 1, 2 and 3. Group 3 had higher
AI than either group 1 or group 2. In the whole study population, serum potassium level, after multivariate regression
analysis testing, was the only factor associated with AI (ß= -0.102; p=0.002). In PA patients, serum potassium level was
the only significant factor correlated with AI. (r= -0.458; p=0.004)
Conclusions: PA patients had higher arterial stiffness but comparable microvascular endothelial function to EH patients.
Hypokalemia correlated with arterial stiffness but not microvascular endothelial function in PA patients.

adrenalectomy reverses adverse vascular changes in PA
patients.8
Hypokalemia plays an important role in various car-
diovascular diseases.9 In a recent study, PA patients with
hypokalemia had a higher cardiovascular morbidity than
PA patients with normokalemia.10 This implies that, in PA
patients, hypokalemia plays a significant role in cardio-
vascular comorbidities. In our recent study, serum potas-
sium level was significantly associated with left
ventricular mass in PA patients.11 However, the influence
of hypokalemia on vascular function and stiffness
remains unclear.
Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is a common non-
invasive method to measure endothelial function.12
However, FMD is limited by its high operator dependence
and wide difference between operators.13 Pulse amplitude
tonometry (PAT), a recent United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved technology, has become a
good alternative choice to measure endothelial function
without subjective measurements of FMD.12,14,15 PAT pre-
sents peripheral endothelial function as the reactive hyper-
emia index (RHI); furthermore, arterial stiffness can be also
calculated from PAT waveform as the augmentation index
(AI). PAT measures endothelial functions of microvascula-
ture. In contrast, FMD measures the endothelial function of
median size vessels. The associations between FMD and
RHI are low, even displaying no association.16,17 Therefore,
it is also of interest to study whether aldosterone influences
the endothelial function of the microvasculature.
In this study, we investigate the differences in micro-
vascular endothelial function and arterial stiffness between
PA and essential hypertension (EH) patients, and the cor-
relation between serum potassium level and peripheral
arterial function among PA patients.
Materials and methods
Patients
This prospective study enrolled 37 patients diagnosed
with primary aldosteronism after an initial evaluation and
who were recorded in the Taiwan Primary Aldosteronism
Investigation (TAIPAI) database from October
2006­October 2011. The database was constructed for
quality assurance at one medical center (National Taiwan
University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan) one branch hospital
(National Taiwan University Hospital Yun-Lin branch,
Yun-Lin, southern Taiwan), and two cooperative hospitals
(Far-Eastern Memorial Hospital, Taipei; Tao-Yuan
General Hospital, Tao-Yuan, central Taiwan).8,11,18­25 The
serum biochemistry studies (including potassium levels)
were measured at the first evaluation of these patients at
the National Taiwan University Hospital. Medical
histories, including demographics and medication were
carefully recorded. Patients with a hypokalemia history
were defined as those who had known hypokalemia
(K<3.5 mg/dl). In addition, another 20 patients with EH
were enrolled as the control group. The diagnosis of EH
was made by exclusion through appropriate clinical and
biochemical investigations of all detectable forms of
secondary hypertension, including having a post-captopril
test of aldosterone-to-renin activity (ARR)<30.26 This
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, and
all patients gave informed consent.
Diagnostic criteria of subtypes of PA
The diagnosis of aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA)
was validated by the modified four corner criteria used
after adrenalectomy as in our previously reports:24,27,28 (a)
evidence of autonomous excess aldosterone production
based on ARR>35 or urine 12 g/24 h and TAIPAI score
more than 60%29 and post-saline loading plasma aldoster-
one concentration (PAC)>10 ng/dl; (b) lateralization of
aldosterone secretion at adrenal vein sampling (AVS) or
during dexamethasone suppression NP-59 single-photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed
tomography (CT);30 (c) evidence of adenoma at CT scan;
and (d) pathologically proven adenoma after an adrenalec-
tomy if operated, and cure of hypertension without anti-
hypertensive agents or improved hypertension, potassium,
PAC, and plasma renin activity (PRA) as described.
Idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) was classified by
the following criteria: (a) evidence of autonomous excess
aldosterone production based on ARR>35 and TAIPAI
score more than 60%; or urine 12 g/24 h and post-saline
loading PAC >10 ng/dl (b) non-lateralization of aldoster-
one secretion at AVS or during dexamethasone suppres-
sion NP-59 SPECT/CT;30 (c) evidence of bilateral diffuse
enlargement on CT scan; and/or (d) evidence of diffuse
cell hyperplasia in the pathology studies.
Assessment of peripheral vascular
function by PAT
Digital pulse amplitude was measured with a non-invasive
PAT placed on the tip of both index fingers (Endo-PAT2000,
Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel). The PAT generates a
pneumatic plethysmo-graph that applies uniform pressure to
the finger surface, which allows measurement of changes in
pulse volume. The inflation pressure of PAT was set to either
10 mmHg below diastolic blood pressure (DBP) or 70
mmHg. The process initially took a two-minute measure-
ment of baseline pulse amplitude.And then, the arterial flow
was occluded for 5 min by a cuff placed on a proximal fore-
arm with occlusion pressure higher than systolic blood pres-
sure (SBP). Data was collected from both index fingers and
analyzed by a computerized automated algorithm (Itamar
Medical) that provided the average pulse amplitude for each
30 s interval after forearm cuff deflation up to 4 min.
Chang et al. 355
The RHI was calculated as the ratio of the average
amplitude of the PAT signal over a one-minute interval
beginning one minute after cuff deflation divided by the
baseline amplitude. Moreover, the AI was calculated by
analyzing the waveform of the PAT signal divided by base-
line and presented as percentage ratio. After natural loga-
rithmic transformation, endothelial dysfunction was
defined by ln (PAT ratio) <0.30.31
Statistical analysis
Data was expressed as mean±standard deviation (SD).
Student's t-test was used to compare the continuous vari-
able between two groups. One-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) test with post-hoc analysis by LSD method
(Fisher's least significant difference method) was used
to compare continuous data of the three groups.To
analyze categorical data, either the Chi-square or the
Fisher's exact test was used. The Pearson's correlation
test was used to analyze the association between AI and
its determinants. Data of PAC, PRA, and ARR were log-
transformed due to non-normality which was tested by
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The clinical factors
showing significant Pearson's correlation (p<0.05) with
AI were further analyzed by multivariate regression test.
A value of p<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical
significance.
Results
Patients
Twenty EH patients (group 1) and 37 PA patients were
enrolled in this study. PA patients were divided in two
groups: 21 with normokalemia (group 2) and 16 with
hypokalemia (group 3). The clinical data is shown in Table
1. Group 3 patients showed significant increases in both
SBP and DBP, and a longer hypertensive history than
group 1. Moreover, they also showed significant differ-
ences in PAC, PRA, log-transformed PAC and log-
transformed PRA than group 1. Group 3 patients also had
a higher SBP, DBP, PAC, log-transformed PAC, and longer
hypertensive history than group 2.
PAT results
First, RHI and AI were tested and compared between EH
and PA patients. The results showed that 37 PA and 20 EH
patients had a significant difference in AI (0.298±0.206 vs
0.195±0.128; p=0.024) but not in RHI (2.209± 0.564 vs

groups of PA patients (normokalemia and hypokalemia)
were further compared with the EH group. The results are
shown in Figure 1. RHI again showed no differences
between groups 1, 2 and 3 (2.0±0.7; 1.9±0.7; 2.2±0.9 in
groups 1, 2, 3; p=0.498 by ANOVA). In AI analysis, group

ANOVA; p<0.001 between groups 1, 3; p=0.001 between
groups 2, 3).
Factors associated with AI
Table 2 contains Pearson's correlation coefficients between
clinical factors and AI in all 57 patients. The coefficients
showed significance in body height, serum potassium
level, DBP, hypertension duration, and presence of PA. In
multivariate regression analysis of AI in all patients, serum
potassium level was the only factor associating with AI
(ß= -0.102; p=0.002; Table 3).
Furthermore, we tested the same clinical factors in 37
PA patients with AI (Table 4). Serum potassium level was
the only factor showing a significant Pearson's correlation
coefficient with AI (r= -0.458; p=0.004).
Discussion
The major findings of this study are as follows: (a) PA
patients have higher AI than EH patients; (b) hypokalemic
PApatients have higherAI than either normokalemic PAor
EH patients; (c) serum potassium level is associated with
arterial stiffness; (d) no significant difference in RHI was
found among 3 groups.
Serum aldosterone level has been recognized as a factor
associated with arterial stiffness, which is an independent
risk factor in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in
hypertensive patients.32,33 Previous studies have provided
implications suggesting this correlation by showing a
reduction in AI in hypertensive patients treated with aldos-
terone antagonists.33,34 Furthermore, the results of our pre-
vious studies not only supported this association in PA
patients who received adrenalectomy, but also further sug-
gested that a reduction in serum aldosterone in PA patients

can improve myocardial fibrosis and carotid intima-media
thickness.35,36 In this study, we provide further evidence
that arterial stiffness in PA patients is still significantly
higher than in EH patients by means of the non-invasive
PAT method.
Hypokalemia is associated with altered cardiac structure
in PA patients, such as left ventricular hypertrophy.26,37 A
recent study revealed that cardiovascular comorbidities,
including angina pectoris and chronic cardiac insufficiency,
are more prevalent in hypokalemic PA patients.10 However,
the effects of hypokalemia on peripheral blood vessels
remain unclear. In our present study, serum potassium level
is the only factor significantly associated with AI in PA
patients. According to our best knowledge, this is the first
study to demonstrate the relationship between arterial
stiffness and hypokalemia in PA patients. Two possible
mechanisms are the alternation of cytosolic calcium cycling
and alternation of signal transduction through Na/K-
ATPase.38 In a cell culture system, reduction in extracellu-
lar potassium produces rapid and sustained increases of
cytosolic calcium concentration and a hypertrophic
response of myocytes in a dose dependent manner.38 In
addition, hypokalemia potentiates cardiac hypertrophy and
decreases tissue Na/K-ATPase activity rates after aortic
constriction surgery.38 However, further studies are neces-
sary to investigate the detailed mechanisms.
Recent studies have reported significant endothelial
dysfunction observed in patients with high aldosterone
level by measuring FMD.5,6,39 However, differences in
endothelial dysfunction among EH or PA groups were
insignificant in our study which measured RHI. In the
Framingham Heart Study, Hamburg et al. have demon-
strated that measuring brachial and digital vascular func-
tion by FMD and RHI respectively that there were
different associations with cardiovascular risk factors
and, interestingly, they were almost uncorrelated with
each other.16 In addition, Lee et al. reported no relation-
ship between the reactive hyperemia-evoked digital PAT
ratio and brachial FMD.17 Furthermore, Schnabel et al.
showed only modest correlations between conduit artery
and peripheral arterial functions and also implied that
they reflected different pathologies due to their different
relationship to cardiovascular risk factors.40 Therefore,
the negative RHI results among the three groups in our
study might imply an insignificant difference in endothe-
lial functions in micro-vasculature.
Limitations of the study
This study is limited by the nature of a cross-section study,
that is, it only shows the correlation between hypokalemia
and AI. Whether hypokalemia is a factor influencing AI or
only a marker of more severe PA is not clearly defined in
this study setting. In addition, this study is also limited by
the number of patients, and may be underpowered to detect
the other possible factors which may be also associated
with AI. A further study with a larger study population is
required.
Conclusion
PA patients had higher arterial stiffness than, but compara-
ble microvascular endothelial function to, EH patients.
Hypokalemia correlated with arterial stiffness but not
microvascular endothelial functions in PA patients.
