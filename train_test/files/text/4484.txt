Introduction and Existing Literature
Earmarking is a time-honored tradition in the US Congress,
and pork barrel projects have long been thought to both
grease the legislative wheels (Evans, 2004) and aid in
members' efforts at gaining re-election (Crespin and
Finocchario, 2013). Under pressure from anti-spending
watchdog groups, though, members of Congress have
increasingly taken a pass on the pork barrel in recent years.
While some in Congress have publicly decried such devel-
opments as an abdication of Congress's responsibility to
guard its spending power from executive encroachments,
many members have turned to other, more surreptitious,
means of securing federal funding for pet projects. That is,
members of Congress, including many of the most vocal
opponents of particularistic spending, have taken to writing
letters to bureaucratic agencies in an effort to fund specific
programs (The New York Times, 2010).
This practice, more colloquially known as "letter-
marking," allows legislators to fly beneath the radar
when it comes to bringing home federal monies, as they
are able to outwardly give the appearance of opposing
earmarks while at the same time privately lobbying for
spending that benefits narrow interests within their dis-
tricts. In turn, such spending offers credit claiming oppor-
tunities if the member wants to emphasize the project.
Some measure of secrecy is afforded to legislators with
lettermarks by virtue of the fact that "a lettermark--
unlike an earmark--is nearly impossible to track"
(Dawson and Kleiner, 2015: 204). And, in spite of the
existence of an Executive Order stipulating that "[a]ll

Abstract
Recent years have witnessed an increase in members' use of lettermarks--letters written to the bureaucracy in an
effort to secure federal funding for their districts. In spite of the vitriol that has been directed toward the practice, it is
unclear whether lettermarks are even effective in aiding legislators' attempts at funneling dollars toward their districts.
In an effort to determine whether lettermarks "work," we combined content analysis of letters sent by members to
the Department of Labor with data on monies awarded to particular districts through the Department of Labor from
the stimulus to investigate the relationship between letter writing and awards to members' districts. We find that,
conditional on ideology, lettermarking can have an effect on the likelihood that a district received stimulus money
through the Department of Labor. For most legislators, though, lettermarking does not appear to be an effective device
for securing federal dollars for their districts. This nuanced set of findings suggests that the bureaucracy may be sensitive
to member ideology when deciding whether to fund certain projects. Given the limited time frame and scope of our data,
though, we urge researchers to continue to pursue this important line of inquiry.

Research Article
2 Research and Politics 
on any earmark shall be made publicly available on the
Internet by the receiving agency" (quoted in Dawson and
Kleiner, 2015: 205), it is rare for bureaucratic agencies to
make copies of lettermarks available to the public
(Dawson and Kleiner, 2015).
The opaque nature of the lettermarking process has led
to a considerable amount of hand-wringing among observ-
ers. Dawson and Kleiner, for instance, describe letter-
marking as a "pernicious practice" (2015 201). In spite of
the amount of controversy that has stemmed from the
practice of lettermarking, though, there is little evidence
that it works. Far from being a "cattle prod to agency
heads" (quoted in Dawson and Kleiner, 2015: 202), what
empirical work exists on the subject suggests that letter-
marks from members of Congress alone are not effective
in securing particularistic outcomes for individual legisla-
tors (Mills and Kalaf-Hughes, 2015; Mills, Kalaf-Hughes,
and MacDonald, 2016). But existing evidence on this
point is drawn from one federal agency, the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA), and employs one, partic-
ularly visible, measure of congressional success: the issu-
ance of a national interest exemption for control towers
that were marked for closure (Mills and Kalaf-Hughes,
2015; Mills, Kalaf-Hughes, and MacDonald, 2016). While
consistent with a lettermarks "do no harm" or "don't mat-
ter" conclusion, the nature of these requests means that
they are likely very visible to organized interests, affected
constituents, and ultimately, voters. Furthermore, the
potential impact of such exemptions on policy and jobs is
both regulatory and substantial. Consequently, while anal-
ysis of lettermarking is challenging due to the need for
systematic data on requests matched to awards or deci-
sions, drawing more generalized inferences about the
effectiveness of lettermarking on the basis of requests for
exemption from FAA recommendations for tower clo-
sures is difficult.
By contrast, the present study focuses on an outcome
that might very well go unnoticed by watchdog groups,
unless, of course, the member chooses to advertise it: the
receipt of federal monies from the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act (ARRA) as administered through the
Department of Labor (DOL). Using content analysis of let-
termarks to the DOL obtained through a Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) request by Cause of Action
Institute, coupled with data on the allocation of federal dol-
lars from the stimulus, we endeavor in this brief paper to
answer a question that has dogged researchers for some
time: Are members of Congress successful in securing par-
ticularistic spending for their districts through the use of
lettermarks? In the following section we describe the data
and methods that we employ in our analysis and highlight
our expectations. After detailing the results from a regres-
sion model predicting the receipt of ARRA dollars from the
DOL, we then go on to situate our findings within the nas-
cent literature on lettermarking.
Data, methods, and expectations
The data used in this paper come from several sources.
Recipient and agency spending data from the stimulus were
obtained from quarterly reports from Recovery.gov--the
government's official website devoted to ARRA spending.1
We reduced this dataset just to the awards that were handed
down through the DOL. This was done so as to combine
our federal awards data with content analysis of lettermarks
that were sent to the DOL over the period from February
2009 to August 2010.2 We reduced the stimulus dataset to
the same time frame, further cutting it down to feature only
awards administered by the DOL that could have possibly
been awarded at the behest of a member (or members) of
Congress. And while we cannot be certain that these files
represent the complete universe of letters sent to the DOL
from members of Congress throughout this time period,
they comprise the best evidence available to us at the cur-
rent juncture, pending additional FOIA requests to other
government agencies.
Lettermarks sent to the DOL were coded for several
items, including whether the letter mentioned the ARRA,
mentioned a particular dollar amount (and, if so, what that
amount was), and whether multiple legislators signed on to
the same letter. In total, 294 unique letters were content-
analyzed from 165 individual legislators. The number
eventually included in this study is smaller, however, as we
focus only on members of the US House in this study in an
effort to be as precise as possible about our outcome varia-
ble of interest, as it is nearly impossible to determine
whether ARRA spending targeted toward, say, a congres-
sional district in New York should also count as spending
targeted toward Senator Chuck Schumer. Focusing only on
members of the US House leaves us with a total of 175 let-
ters from 124 different legislators.
In addition, information on members' partisan affilia-
tions and ideological proclivities (as measured by
DW-NOMINATE) was merged with our content analysis
and data from the stimulus. We also included a measure of
district "need" as well--the percent unemployed in each
district (see also Mills and Kalaf-Hughes, 2015).3 This
measure was culled from the US Census. The unit of analy-
sis in the final dataset is the individual legislator, leaving us
with 446 total cases--the number of unique legislators who
served in the US House over the time period under investi-
gation.4 As such, several of our content analysis items were
calculated in terms of counts (such as the number of letters
to the DOL authored by a particular legislator over this time
period) or proportions (for instance, the proportion of all
letters that were co-authored by other legislators--typically
an entire state delegation).
The dependent variable that we employ in the first part
of our analysis is the natural log of the stimulus dollars
received from the DOL by the legislator's district over the
period under examination. We obtain the same basic results,
Neiheisel and Brady 3
though, if we use a binary indicator of whether or not a
district received any awards from the stimulus through the
DOL (results not shown). Our key independent variables
include an indicator for whether a legislator wrote a letter to
the DOL requesting funds, a measure of legislator ideology,
legislator partisanship, and a series of interaction terms.
We include these interaction terms in an effort to explore
the possibility that the effect of lettermarks may be condi-
tional on the ideological leanings of the legislator request-
ing funding from the DOL and his or her party. For much as
the effect of lettermarks appears to be conditioned by the
preferences of the granting agency (Mills and Kalaf-
Hughes, 2015; Mills, Kalaf-Hughes, and MacDonald,
2016), we expect the political leanings of a bureaucratic
agency's principal--the president--to affect their willing-
ness to bend to pressure from legislators. Since the legisla-
tive agendas of Democratic presidents typically fare better
among more liberal members of Congress--Democrat and
Republican alike--we expect that the bureaucracy is more
likely to grant requests for funding from more liberal repre-
sentatives. Doing so serves to reward members for their
support of the president (or a promise of future support)
and, in turn, provides legislators with the ability to credit-
claim (Grimmer, Messing, and Westwood, 2012).
Legislators often highlight their ability to channel pub-
lic dollars toward their own districts in their pursuit of re-
election (Hudak, 2014: 19), and we would expect the
bureaucracy to be more than happy to offer members
opportunities to do so, conditional on their ideological
leanings (Alexander, Berry, and Howell, 2016) and parti-
sanship (Berry, Burden, and Howell, 2010; cf. Dynes and
Huber, 2015; Gimpel, Lee, and Thorpe, 2012).5 In particu-
lar, we might expect pleas for stimulus dollars from liberal
Democrats to be especially effective at seeing results.
Ideological extremity is often punished at the polls (Canes-
Wrone, Brady, and Cogan, 2002), and ideologically
extreme members of the majority party may see more in
the way of credit-claiming opportunities funneled their
direction in an effort to compensate them for any possible
losses that they might incur from assembling a voting
record that is reliably liberal in nature (see, for instance,
Carroll and Kim, 2010). While ideological purism from
co-partisans in Congress is likely a boon to the administra-
tion's legislative agenda, victories in the legislative arena
can only be sustained if the president's core supporters
keep their jobs in the next election. Alternatively, the exec-
utive may have simply sought to reward good partisans for
their loyalty when they saw it fit to ask for something over
which the bureaucracy held dominion.
As for our expectations regarding specific features of
the letters themselves that might track with the receipt of
stimulus dollars, it seems likely that several might matter.
In particular, we suspect that mentioning a specific mone-
tary amount should correlate with the amount received
given the voluminous literature on policy implementation
that points to specificity as a key determinant of bureau-
cratic compliance (Huber and Shipan, 2002; Van Horn and
Van Meter, 1977). Bureaucrats may be unwilling to write
members a blank check for initiatives in their district, but
discrete amounts that are (presumably) coupled with more
detailed plans for the funds are likely to be effective. The
number of legislators signing on to a particular letter may
also serve as a heuristic for bureaucrats who are seeking to
determine the support for particular initiatives, thereby
increasing the possibility that funds will be allocated for
such a purpose.
Results
In testing our expectations we began by estimating a model
predicting the logged dollars received by a representative's
district through the DOL from stimulus funds. Table A1 in
the online Appendix displays estimates from this model,
which includes measures of party, ideology, and district
need in addition to a series of interaction terms. It is impor-
tant to note that we cannot reject the null that lettermark-
ing, in isolation, has no effect on the receipt of stimulus
dollars. The inclusion of a triple interaction necessitates,
though, that we visually inspect the substantive effect of
lettermarking, conditional on both party and ideology
(Brambor, Clark, and Golder, 2005). Figure 1 therefore
displays the marginal effect of writing a letter to the DOL
over the observed range of DW-NOMINATE for both
Republican and Democratic members. For Republicans,
writing a letter to the DOL has no discernible effect on the
amount of money that they received through the DOL from
the stimulus (see the right panel in Figure 1). While the
effect of letter writing is not statistically significant (with
90 percent confidence intervals) throughout the observed
range of DW-NOMINATE for Republicans, the overall
pattern suggests that those who lobbied the bureaucracy
for funds actually did worse than those who did not. We
are reluctant, however, to suggest that the bureaucracy
may punish conservative legislators who request money
for their districts via lettermarking. Rather, we suspect that
Republican (GOP) members of the House who engaged in
such activities were attempting to overcome some kind of
a deficit by contacting the DOL about the need to fund
projects in their districts.
On the Democratic side of things (see the left panel in
Figure 1), it appears that lettermarking had a positive and
statistically significant (p<0.1) effect on the receipt of funds
through the DOL from the stimulus, but only for extreme
liberals. Democratic members who engaged in lettermark-
ing and are -0.5 or lower on our measure of ideology (scores
that correspond with more liberal roll call voting records)
received more ARRA dollars than did similarly situated
Democrats who did not write a letter to the DOL. Although
the effect is not statistically significant, the pattern dis-
played in Figure 1 suggests that more moderate Democrats
4 Research and Politics 
who wrote a letter to the DOL actually received less money
than other moderate Democratic members who did not
attempt to lobby the bureaucracy. This result mimics the
pattern observed among GOP members. Our results there-
fore demonstrate that only liberal Democrats--those who
are the most likely to support the president's legislative
agenda--reaped any benefit from contacting the bureau-
cracy in an effort to secure a slice of the federal pie for their
constituents. Although we do not show them here, these
same basic results obtain when we substitute raw
DW-NOMINATE scores for the ideological distance
between each member and the estimated ideology of the
DOL under Obama--as calculated by Chen and Johnson
(2015). That is to say that Democratic legislators to the left
of the DOL were the only ones who appear to have benefit-
ted from engaging in lettermarking.6
Controlling for district partisanship (as proxied by the
Democratic share of the vote for president in the previous
election) pushes even this conditional effect into the realm
of statistical insignificance (results not shown). Thus, while
there is some evidence that lettermarking "works" when
undertaken by liberal Democrats, on balance, our results
suggest that, for most members across both sides of the
aisle, letter writing was epiphenomenal or served some
other interest beyond securing dollars. Still, the presence of
a marginal effect for the most loyal Democrats is worthy of
additional research, if and when additional lettermarking
data were to be available as a means to analyze vote trading,
partisan reward, and/or bureaucratic bias in conjunction
with the distribution of federal discretionary grants.
But are there any features of lettermarks that make them
especially effective? Using measures constructed from the
content analysis described above, we estimated a model
predicting the (logged) funds received from the stimulus
(via the DOL) using data on only those members who wrote
at least one letter. Results from this model are displayed in
Table A2 in the online Appendix. What is striking about
this segment of the analysis is that remarkably few features
of the letters that the members sent to the DOL have any
discernible impact on the receipt of stimulus awards.
Consistent with the patterns displayed in Figure 1, legisla-
tor ideology is statistically significant (p<0.05), with more
conservative members of the House receiving fewer stimu-
lus dollars throughout the period under observation. But
only one feature of members' letters correlates with the
amount received from the ARRA. The proportion of mem-
bers' letters that mentioned a particular dollar amount is a
positive and statistically significant (p=0.05) predictor of
the amount allocated to their district. Specificity, it seems,
pays dividends when it comes to lettermarking.7
Of course, this finding squares with a broader constella-
tion of results from earlier studies exploring principal-agent
relationships across a range of different contexts. Boyd
(2015), for instance, finds that federal district judges are
more likely to change their behavior in response to specific,
unambiguous signals from their direct principal--circuit

court judges. Similarly, the literature on policy implemen-
tation suggests that "policy precision," to use Huber and
Shipan's (2002) terminology, is a powerful tool that legisla-
tors can use to exert control over the bureaucracy. Along
these same lines, Van Horn and Van Meter (1977) maintain
that bureaucratic compliance with the policy standards set
forth by their principals requires that legislators communi-
cate their expectations with a level of clarity that promotes
effective policy implementation. Effective communication
of what, exactly, they would like to see in the form of dis-
bursements from the DOL through their letters appears to
have aided legislators in their pursuit of credit-claiming
opportunities.
Discussion and conclusion
Although our study is limited in scope to a short timeframe
and draws upon evidence from a single entity within the
bureaucracy, the findings outlined in this brief note build
upon existing research on lettermarking and effectively
qualify normative critiques of the practice that have charac-
terized communications from legislators as having undue
influence on the bureaucracy. By analyzing a different pol-
icy area across a broader range of potential projects, our
analysis takes a significant step forward in advancing our
understanding of lettermarks as a replacement for earmarks
in an era that is increasingly characterized by Congress's
willingness to delegate authority over the power of the
purse to the president and the federal bureaucracy.
We find that lettermarks can be effective when they
include specific details such as a dollar amount.
Furthermore, the effect of lettermarking is conditioned by
political attributes of the legislator making the request--
such as partisanship and ideology. It therefore appears that
the bureaucrats responsible for doling out federal funds are
sensitive to the ideological leanings of legislators as they
go about making decisions about which districts receive
awards (see also Alexander, Berry, and Howell, 2016). That
the effectiveness of lettermarking may be moderated by
political factors (notably increasing toward the direction of
the president) mirrors some of the politics of earmarks
where the victors get the spoils and the loyalists get even
more. This suggests, consistent with other recent work by
Mills and colleagues (2016), that the bureaucracy is now
the ultimate arbiter of (to channel Lasswell) who gets what,
when, and how. Even though certain members of Congress
may be able to guide the process from time to time, it
appears that the bureaucracy is very much in the driver's
seat when it comes to the distribution of stimulus dollars.
As such, if Congress wishes to assert control over the purse
strings, then a return to good old-fashioned earmarking
may be necessary.
In closing, then, it is important to note that most legisla-
tors do not appear to have benefitted from writing letter-
marks to the bureaucracy. This raises the question, of
course, of why members across the partisan and ideological
spectrum engage in such efforts. In his seminal work,
Mayhew (1974: 59­60) emphasized that members' claims
regarding their efforts at providing particularized benefits
to their constituents must be credible. The existence of let-
ters to the bureaucracy requesting funds or special consid-
eration for pet projects in their home districts likely afford
legislators with a measure of credibility in this arena, even
in cases in which their actions were not determinative. As
such, lettermarks may provide members with ample credit-
claiming opportunities in the absence of a direct linkage
between their actions and the geographic targeting of fed-
eral dollars (see also Grimmer, Messing and Westwood,
2012). We therefore urge future researchers to continue
pursuing this line of inquiry.

3. In some specifications we also included a measure of
health facility need at the district level (as calculated by the

model. Doing so did not influence our main results.
4. Representative Parker Griffith (AL) is included twice since
he switched parties over this time period.
5. Additional empirical support for this expectation as it per-
tains specifically to the effect of lettermarking on bureau-
cratic behavior comes from Mills and Kalaf-Hughes (2015),
who find that Democrats--the party in the White House at
the time of their study--received more in the way of distribu-
tive benefits than did members of the out-party.
6. As an additional robustness check, we also attempted to
make those who wrote letters to the DOL and those who
did not as comparable as possible through the use of match-
ing. Specifically, we used the Stata add-on psmatch2 to cal-
culate propensity scores that were, in turn, used to weight
6 Research and Politics 
our data before running any analyses. Pre-processing the
data in this manner helps to reduce model dependency and
improve balance between comparison groups. We matched
on party, ideology, percent unemployed, and party unity.
As Table A3 in the online Appendix illustrates, balance
between those who wrote letters and those who did not was
greatly improved on these key dimensions after matching.
Ultimately, however, pre-processing the data using match-
ing did not alter the substantive conclusions that we were
able to draw from our analysis (see the model estimates
displayed in Table A4 and the marginal effects plots shown
in Figure A2 in the online Appendix).
7. Intriguingly, neither freshman status nor membership on
the House Committee on Appropriations predicts member
receipt of stimulus monies from the DOL in a model specifi-
cation that is otherwise identical to those detailed in the first
two columns of Table A2 in the online Appendix (see the
third and fourth columns in TableA2 for details; cf. Mills and
Kalaf-Hughes, 2015).
