Objectives. The study investigates the social and demographic, personality and social contact correlates of emotional
support and negative interaction among older Black Americans.
Methods. The present analyses are based on the responses of 519 older African American respondents (55足96 years
old) from the Americans' Changing Lives Survey. Structural equation modeling (e.g., LISREL) was used to estimate the
direct and indirect effects of sociodemographic variables (i.e., age, gender, education, income, marital status, and presence
of children), social contact factors (i.e., frequency of face-to-face and telephone contact), and personality (i.e., extraversion
and neuroticism) on emotional support and negative interaction with relatives and friends.
Results. Gender, marital status, and extraversion were significantly associated with emotional support. Age, education,
marital status, having a child, and neuroticism were identified as correlates of negative interaction.
Discussion. The majority of older Black adults in this sample participated in emotionally supportive relations with
relatives and friends, whereas negative social interactions were reported with less frequency. The distinctive group of
predictors explaining emotional support and negative interaction suggests that they are different social occurrences. This
analysis particularly underscores the role of personality factors in these processes.
THE social networks and social relationships of older adults
have raised fundamental questions in social gerontology
since its inception as a field of study (e.g., disengagement and
activity theories). Although much of the prior literature is
predominated by a focus on emotional support among older
adults (Ingersoll-Dayton, Morgan, & Antonucci, 1997), current
theory and research incorporate notions of conflict and other
negative occurrences (e.g., criticism or demands) as inevitable
features of interpersonal relations with family members and
others. Emotional support refers to exchanges between in-
dividuals that involve expressing care and affection, validating
the person's worth, and confiding (listening to problems).
Negative interaction, in contrast, connotes social exchanges
between individuals that are perceived by the recipient as
nonsupportive, critical, harmful, or otherwise inconsequential
to their needs (see Lincoln, 2000, for a review). Emotional
support and negative social interactions are important ante-
cedents to mental health and well-being outcomes (Finch,
Okun, Barrera, Zautra, & Reich, 1989; Rook, 1984); emotional
support has a beneficial impact on health and well-being,
whereas negative interaction (e.g., being too demanding or
critical) is detrimental to health. Although negative interaction
occurs with less frequency than emotional support, it appears to
be more important for predicting health and well-being (Finch
et al., 1989; Ingersoll-Dayton et al., 1997; Rook, 1984).
African Americans and Social Interaction
The majority of African American elderly people (Barker,
Morrow, & Mitteness, 1998; Johnson, 1999; Taylor & Chatters,
1986) are involved in strong and viable social support networks
of immediate and extended family and nonkin associates (e.g.,
friends, fictive kin, and church members) and interpersonal
relationships that involve exchanges of social support (e.g.,
emotional support and instrumental aid). However, African
Americans are also likely to experience conflictual relations
with the members of their support networks. Unfortunately,
there is little research on the degree to which older Black adults,
or minority elderly adults, more generally, are involved in
unpleasant, conflictual, and other negative interactions with
family and friends. The purpose of this article is to investigate
the correlates of emotional support and negative interaction
among older Black Americans. This analysis utilizes the older
African American subsample of the Americans' Changing
Lives data set and examines demographic, social contact, and
personality factors (extraversion, neuroticism) as correlates of
emotional support and negative interaction.
Much of the literature on the informal support networks
of African Americans focuses on general support exchanges,
with little emphasis on negative social interaction. Further, the
available research examines the consequences of emotional
support and negative interaction with respect to health and
well-being outcomes in defined groups. For example, Gant and
Ostrow's (1995) study of HIV-positive men found that negative
interaction (e.g., feeling misunderstood) with social network
members had a greater impact on measures of mental health
than did social support and was highly correlated with tension
or anxiety, depression, anger or hostility, and loneliness. Stud-
ies of pregnant and parenting adolescent mothers and their re-
lationship with their parents (Davis & Rhodes, 1994; Davis,
Rhodes, & Hamilton-Leaks, 1997) indicate that adolescents
who receive more parental support (i.e., from their own mothers
and fathers) have lower levels of depression (Davis et al.,

1997). In contrast, relationship problems (i.e., negative in-
teraction) such as disappointment, intrusiveness, and criticism
are associated with psychological distress (Davis & Rhodes,
1994) and social adjustment problems (Davis & Rhodes, 1994).
Further, low parental support and negative interaction with
fathers is associated with higher levels of depression (Davis
et al., 1997). Despite problems of small and specialized, non-
probability samples, this research is a promising initial attempt
at exploring the impact of negative social interaction on the
supportive networks of Black Americans.
Theoretical Perspectives
Current approaches to examining social networks and
interaction in later life (Ajrouch, Antonucci, & Janevic, 2001)
are increasingly concerned with both emotional support and
negative aspects of social interaction. Socioemotional selectiv-
ity theory (Carstensen, 1995; Lang, Saudinger, & Carstensen,
1998) specifically examines issues of social network size
and the emotional quality of later life relationships. The theory
posits that, because of awareness of one's mortality, older
persons are motivated to pursue social relationships that opti-
mize short-term goals of emotional gratification, and hence
they actively select emotionally ``close'' social partners in lieu
of individuals who are less intimate. Although socioemotional
selectivity results in declines in the overall size of the social
network with advancing age, these networks are characterized
as emotionally close with high levels of social integration. Com-
parable findings have been noted elsewhere in the literature
among samples of the U.S. population (Antonucci & Akiyama,
1987), the German elderly population (Lang et al., 1998), and
African American elderly population (Ajrouch, Antonucci, &
Janevic, 2001), verifying that small, emotionally close net-
works are typical for the very old.
Demographic and Social Correlates of Emotional
Support and Negative Interaction
Findings for age effects for various dimensions of social net-
works (i.e., size, composition, and contact) are generally
consistent with socioemotional selectivity theory. Fung, Car-
stensen, and Lang (2001) found that among both Blacks and
Whites, older and younger persons report comparable numbers
of close social partners, but older persons have fewer peripheral
social partners in their social networks. Furthermore, Lansford,
Sherman, and Antonucci (1998) found that, across three age
cohorts of nationally representative samples of Black and White
adults, older persons tended to express greater satisfaction with
the size of their informal networks, while at the same time they
reported less frequent contact with networks overall. Compared
with Caucasians, African American respondents had smaller
networks with a higher proportion of family members and
reported more contact with their networks. Taylor and Chatters
(1986) found that more than a quarter of older Blacks indicated
that emotional assistance (e.g., companionship, advice, and
comfort) was the most important type of aid received from their
support networks; best friends were important for providing
companionship, whereas church members were important with
respect to advice and encouragement. Finally, Johnson and Barer
(1995) found that although Black and White respondents receive
comparable levels of emotional support from children and
grandchildren, Blacks are more likely to receive emotional sup-
port from extended kin.
In contrast, several studies involving older African Ameri-
cans indicate either no age differences in level of contact and
emotional closeness to extended kin networks (Taylor &
Chatters, 1991) or declines in support from family and church
members (Taylor, 1985; Taylor & Chatters, 1986) with
advanced age. With regard to negative interaction, Rook's
(1984) study of a small sample of elderly widows failed to find
any differences in negative interaction across a variety of
indicators, including age. In contrast, other studies indicate that
age is inversely associated with negative social interaction.
Younger versus older (mean age of 68.9 vs. 73.6 years) stroke
patients (Stephens, Kinney, Norris, & Ritchie, 1987), younger
versus older (mean age of 62.6 vs. 68.8 years) caregivers
(Pagel, Erdly, & Becker, 1987), and younger versus older (28足
59 vs. 60足92 years) respondents (Okun & Keith, 1998) indi-
cated more negative interactions with their family and social
networks (i.e., spouse, children, other relatives, and friends).
Findings for other sociodemographic correlates are less con-
sistent. With respect to gender, women's greater overall invest-
ment in interpersonal and supportive relationships (so-called
relationship work) suggests that they may receive higher levels of
emotional support relative to men. In contrast, women's greater
social involvement could also mean that they are potentially
more vulnerable to experiencing negative aspects of these re-
lationships. The research evidence is equivocal and indicates
that women are more likely than men to report negative inter-
actions with their social networks (Pagel et al., 1987), Black
women are more likely than Black men to receive support from
adult children (Mutran, 1985), and older Black women and men
are equally likely to receive expressive support from extended
family members (Johnson, 1999). Education effects on social
interaction indicate that persons with higher levels of education
tend to receive greater amounts of assistance from family
(Mutran, 1985), whereas other research indicates that education
is unrelated to negative interaction (Pagel et al., 1987; Rook,
1984).
Marital and parental statuses represent primary and intimate
personal relationships that facilitate feelings of social embed-
dedness and emotional closeness (Lang et al., 1998). Compo-
sitional differences in the social networks of elderly adults who
are married and parents (i.e., as opposed to unmarried and
childless) embody greater levels of socioemotional selectivity
and maximize opportunities for emotionally satisfying relation-
ships. Particular nonmarried statuses (i.e., divorced) may result
in decreased levels of support from family (Taylor, 1986) and
church networks (Taylor & Chatters, 1986). Further, being
married and a parent provides opportunities for older indi-
viduals to be engaged in social interaction with others (in
addition to spouses and children), is a link to other social
resources such as extended family (Taylor, 1985, 1986; Taylor
& Chatters, 1986) and church members (Taylor & Chatters,
1986), and is associated with larger helper networks (Chatters,
Taylor, & Jackson, 1985, 1986) and more positive appraisals
of affective dimensions of family life (Taylor & Chatters,
1991). Social contact (i.e., telephone and face to face) not only
provides opportunities to engage in social interaction with
family and friends but is associated with feelings of emotional
closeness (Krause, Liang, & Keith, 1990; Taylor, 1985, 1986).

Conversely, social contact is likely diminished for those per-
sonal relationships that are viewed as being detrimental.
Personality Correlates
Extraversion and neuroticism are two primary dimensions
of personality that have received considerable attention in
connection with social networks and relationships (e.g., Krause
et al., 1990). Extraverts are characterized as individuals who are
talkative, warm, and sociable, enjoy the company of others,
prefer large groups, and actively seek out the opportunity to
socialize. These attitudes and behaviors, in turn, create and
maintain positive interaction and feedback from others. Extra-
version is associated with larger networks, perceptions of
support availability, and a greater propensity for social network
formation and maintenance (Russell, Booth, Reed, & Laughlin,
1997). Among older adults, extraversion was associated with
social contact (e.g., visits and contact by phone or letter) with
family and friends (Krause et al., 1990) and larger social
networks (Lang et al., 1998), but it was unrelated to perceptions
of emotional closeness with the network (Lang et al., 1998). In
contrast, persons with high levels of neuroticism are quiet and
reserved, ineffective interpersonally, feel anxious in social
situations, and withdraw or disengage from social interaction.
Neuroticism is associated with conflictual relationships (Berry,
Willingham, & Thayer, 2000), lower levels of support (Russell
et al., 1997), and, among older adults (Lang et al., 1998),
negative interaction (bivariate association).
The Proposed Model
Figure 1 illustrates the conceptual model of the proposed
relationships between demographic and family status factors,
personality, telephone and face-to-face contact, and emotional
support and negative interaction. The notation used in the model
is in accordance with that devised by Jo
即reskog and So
即rbom
(2001), in which the etas represent the latent or unobserved
constructs, the xis represent the latent exogenous constructs, and
the psis represent the correlation between the disturbance terms.
The disturbance terms in the equation predicting extraversion
and neuroticism (g1
and g2
) are correlated. This specification
suggests that extraversion and neuroticism are two dimensions of
the same construct, personality, that may be related in some
manner. Similarly, the disturbance terms predicting emotional
support and negative interaction (g5
and g6
) are correlated. This
specification suggests that the experience or perception of
emotional support from network members is related, in some
manner, to the negative interaction experienced or perceived.
Correlating the disturbance terms in this manner makes it pos-
sible to consider the potential association between the factors
without specifying a particular causal direction.
The proposed model is a reflection of theoretical suggestions
from socioemotional selectivity theory, as well as empirical
findings on the personality and sociodemographic correlates of
social relationships. Focusing first on endogenous constructs,
the model posits that personality is associated with frequency
of social contact, emotional support, and negative interaction.
Extraverted individuals are predicted to have more frequent
telephone and face-to-face contact and to receive more emo-
tional support from network members, whereas the reverse is
anticipated for those high on neuroticism. Individuals who
have more frequent social contact with members of their social
network, both by means of the telephone and face to face, are
expected to report more emotional support and have less neg-
ative interaction with network members, whereas the opposite
is expected for persons with low levels of social contact.
Consistent with expectations from socioemotional selectivity
theory, age status will exhibit a number of specific relationships
with social contact and social relationship factors that reflect
older persons' tendency to be more selective in their social
relations and to maximize these interactions. Accordingly, we
anticipate that age will be positively associated with emotional
support and inversely related to negative interaction with
relatives and friends. However, as noted previously, despite
generally high levels of satisfaction with social networks, older
respondents tend to report less frequent contact (Lansford et al.,
1998). Consequently, we expect that age will also be inversely
associated with levels of telephone and face-to-face contact.
Finally, research in the area of personality suggests that
differences in social networks and relationships may, in part, be
explained by basic personality distinctions. In particular, prior
research notes that older persons differ from younger in-
dividuals with respect to personality characteristics, such that
older age is associated with higher levels of extraversion and
lower levels of neuroticism. The model's inclusion of age status
and personality factors will provide an estimation of their
independent effects on social contact and relationships and
some assessment of the validity of the selectivity hypothesis
within the context of individual factors that are known to be
associated with social interaction. That is, we can determine, to
some extent, whether observed differences in social contacts
and relationships are attributable to socioemotional selectivity
processes (which are associated with advanced age) or to
differences in personality characteristics (i.e., extraversion or
neuroticism) that are themselves known to be associated with
social factors (e.g., network size, social contact, and conflict).
Previous research suggests that sociodemographic status
factors are associated with personality characteristics and are
important in terms of access to social resources and in patterning
social relationships. With respect to gender, women are expected
to report higher levels of emotional support and negative inter-
action, and social contact and neuroticism, but lower levels of
extraversion, as compared with men. Education effects are less

factors, personality, social contact, emotional support, and negative
interaction.
EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND NEGATIVE INTERACTION S227
clear cut, but we anticipate that more education is associated with
higher levels of emotional support and social contact but lower
levels of neuroticism and negative interaction. Marital and
parental statuses will be associated with model components in
a similar manner; married persons and parents will demonstrate
higher levels of emotional support, social contact, and extra-
version and lower levels of negative interaction and neuroti-
cism. Finally, because interactions with relatives and friends
can reflect both beneficial and detrimental aspects, we antici-
pate that emotional support and negative interaction will have
a weak, inverse relationship (Okun & Keith, 1998).
This investigation of the correlates of emotional support and
negative interaction among older African Americans addresses
several questions in the research literature. First, it examines
demographic and social contact factors (e.g., face-to-face and
telephone contact) as correlates of emotional support and neg-
ative interaction from relatives and friends. Second, it exam-
ines the influence of personality factors (neuroticism and
extraversion) on emotional support and negative interaction and
assesses their contribution to social interactions. Third, because
the analysis is based on a large subsample of older African
Americans from a major national sample, it provides greater
sociodemographic variability and representativeness of find-
ings. Finally, structural equation modeling techniques are used
that provide the opportunity to specify a theoretically driven
causal model of these relationships that assesses direct, indirect,
and total effects of model components.
METHODS
Data
The Americans' Changing Lives study is a multistage
stratified probability panel survey of persons 25 years of age
and older and who live in the coterminous United States. Face-
to-face interviews were conducted in 1986, resulting in 3,617
completed interviews and a response rate of 67%. Blacks and
persons aged 60 and older were oversampled at a rate twice that
of Whites under the age of 60. This data set includes 1,174
African American respondents. The present analyses are based
on the responses of 519 African American older respondents
(55足96 years of age; M 村 68:18 and SD 村 8:14). Approxi-
mately 68% of the respondents are women, 38% are married,
the average number of years of education is 8.73 (SD 村 3:89),
and 67% are parents.
Analysis Issues
Table 1 presents the items used to develop the model
constructs depicted in Figure 1. All analyses were conducted
by using covariance matrices as input and the maximum likeli-
hood estimator in LISREL 8.51 (Jo
即reskog & So
即rbom, 2001).
The standardized factor loadings and measurement errors (indi-
cated next to each item) provide information about the psycho-
metric properties of the measures. Although there are no firmly
established guidelines regarding cutoff points, researchers
generally agree that items above .40 have acceptable psycho-
metric properties. The data in Table 1 indicate that individual
factor loadings were moderate to high in magnitude, ranging
from .441 to 1.000.
There has been much discussion concerning the appropriate
number of indicators for latent constructs. In general, the
strategy for selecting items for latent variables involves select-
ing multiple observed variables that reliably and validly de-
monstrate good indicators of the construct in question (John &
Benet-Martinez, 2000). Although there are no rules regarding
the appropriate number of indicators per factor, recommenda-
tions range from 1 to 12 items (Marsh, Hau, Balla, & Grayson,
1998). Results from the current analyses indicate that the mea-
sured items have face validity and function within the model as
would be theoretically expected (i.e., the hypothesized relations
concerning them hold). Given that the items reflect the
construct, they are related to other variables as expected under
the theory, and the model fits well, we believe that we are
tapping the constructs of interest.
Measures
Emotional support and negative interaction. --Two indica-
tors measuring emotional support from relatives and friends ask
respondents the extent to which network members (a) make
them feel loved and cared for and (b) are willing to listen
to them discuss worries or problems. Two indicators of nega-
tive interaction with relatives and friends assess the extent to
which they (a) make too many demands (e.g., interference
or demands) and (b) are critical of the respondent and what
they do (e.g., criticism or ridicule). Each item has five re-
sponse categories, ranging from ``not at all'' to ``a great deal,''
with a high score corresponding to more emotional sup-
port or negative interaction.
Frequency of telephone and face-to-face contact. --One
indicator measuring frequency of telephone contact asked
respondents to indicate how often they talk on the telephone
with friends, neighbors, or relatives in a typical week. Response

categories range from ``never'' to ``more than once a day,'' with
higher scores representing more frequent telephone contact.
The measure of frequency of face-to-face contact asked
respondents to indicate how often they get together with
friends, neighbors, or relatives to socialize. Response categories
range from ``never'' to ``more than once a week,'' with higher
scores reflecting more frequent contact.
Personality. --Extraversion was measured with three indica-
tors that reflect the degree to which respondents felt that they
(a) take the initiative to make friends, (b) prefer to stay in the
background on social occasions (reverse coded), and (c) are
mostly quiet with others (reverse coded). Neuroticism was
measured with three indicators that asked respondents to
indicate the extent to which they (a) consider themselves
moody, (b) felt fed up, or (c) were tense or high strung.
Response categories for all items were ``no,'' ``sometimes,'' and
``yes,'' with a higher score on these indicators reflecting high
levels of extraversion or neuroticism.
Sociodemographic controls. --All analyses were conducted
with the effects of age and education (coded continuously),
gender (0 村 male; 1 村 female), marital status (0 村 married; 1 村
unmarried), and parental status (0 村 no children; 1 村 has
children) taken into account.
RESULTS
The means, standard deviations, and range for the study
variables are presented in Table 2. Consistent with previous
research (e.g., Finch et al., 1989; Rook, 1984), overall, positive
interactions (e.g., emotional support) occur with greater fre-
quency than negative interactions. Respondents reported, on
average, that their relatives and friends made them feel loved
and cared for (M 村 4:18; SD 村 0:97) and were willing to listen
to their problems (M 村 3:83; SD 村 1:18) more often than their
relatives and friends made too many demands (M 村 1:46;
SD 村 :85) and were critical of them (M 村 1:60; SD 村 0:97).
Further, older African Americans reported a high frequency of
telephone (M 村 4:48; SD 村 1:58) and face-to-face contact
(M 村 3:95; SD 村 1:67).
Table 3 and Figure 2 present the completely standardized
maximum likelihood parameter estimates for the proposed causal
model. A significant but weak negative correlation between
emotional support and negative interaction among relatives and
friends (b 村 耽:180; p , :05) was observed. An examination of
the direct, indirect, and total effects provides a comprehensive
picture of the process by which the model components are
interrelated. Extraversion is positively associated with telephone
(b 村 :205; p , :05) and face-to-face (b 村 :422; p , :01)
contact and emotional support (b 村 :503; p , :01). Although
extraversion leads to greater social contact and emotional sup-
port, there are no mediating relations among these constructs. The
indirect effect, although statistically significant, is small and
may be the result of the effects of other variables that were
not included in the model. Neuroticism is related to negative
interaction, such that high neuroticism scores are associated with
negative interaction with relatives and friends (b 村 :421;
p , :01). Table 4 presents the coefficients for the effects of
exogenous variables on the latent constructs. With respect to age
differences, persons of advanced age are more extraverted
(b 村 :165; p , :05), less neurotic (b 村 耽:117; p , :05), and
report fewer negative interactions (b 村 耽:279; p , :01) with
relatives and friends, compared with their younger counterparts.

EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND NEGATIVE INTERACTION S229
Age influences face-to-face interaction both directly and
indirectly; although face-to-face contact declines with age
(b 村 耽:114; p , :05; direct effect), this relationship is offset
(i.e., mediated) by a positive indirect effect of age by means of
extraversion (b 村 :059; p , :05). Compared with men, women
report higher levels of neuroticism (b 村 :241; p , :01), more
frequent telephone contact (b 村 :390; p , :001), and more
emotional support (b 村 :195; p , :01) from relatives and
friends. Although the data indicate a direct effect of gender on
face-to-face contact (b 村 耽:117; p , :05), the total effect is
reduced to insignificance (b 村 耽:054; ns) once the indirect effect
by means of extraversion is taken into account. Further, the direct
effect of gender on negative interaction (b 村 耽:222; p , :05) is
offset by its indirect effect by means of neuroticism (b 村 :125;
p , :05). Although women report less face-to-face contact and
fewer negative interactions with relatives and friends, this re-
lationship is explained, in part, by the higher levels of neuroti-
cism among women.
Persons with higher levels of education are more extraverted
than their counterparts (b 村 :300; p , :001). Education has both
direct and indirect effects on telephone contact and emotional
support; higher levels of education are associated with more
telephone contact (b 村 :221; p , :01), which is due, in part, to
higher levels of extraversion (b 村 :058; p , :05; indirect effect)
among older persons with more education. Although education
has no direct effect on face-to-face contact, education operates
through extraversion (b 村 :123; p , :05; indirect effect) to
affect the frequency of face-to-face contact (b 村 :097; p , :05;
total effect). Older persons with more years of formal education
also report lower levels of emotional support from network
members (b 村 耽:157; p , :05). However, this direct effect is
mediated by the indirect effect by means of extraversion
(b 村 :156; p , :01). Thus, the total effect of education on
emotional support is not significant (b 村 耽:001; ns). With
respect to education and negative interaction, older African
Americans with more education report more negative interaction
with relatives and friends, compared with their less educated
counterparts (b 村 :117; p , :05; total effect).
With respect to marital status, older persons who are
unmarried are less extraverted (b 村 耽:144; p , :05) and report
less frequent telephone contact with relatives and friends
(b 村 耽:174; p , :01; total effect) than their married counter-
parts. An indirect effect of marital status on emotional support
by means of extraversion indicates that unmarried persons
report less emotional support from network members, partially
because of their lower levels of extraversion (b 村 耽:153;
p , :05; total effect). In addition, marital status is significantly
related to negative interaction, such that unmarried persons
report more conflict with relatives and friends (b 村 :121;
p , :05; total effect). Finally, respondents who have children
report lower levels of negative interaction with relatives and
friends (b 村 耽:184; p , :05; total effect), compared with those
without children. The squared multiple correlations for the
structural equations (the equivalent of R2) indicate that the set
of factors explain 22.5% of the variance in emotional support
and 30% of the variance in negative interaction.
DISCUSSION
This investigation found that older Black Americans were
more likely to report emotionally supportive, as opposed to
negative interactions with relatives and friends. This is consistent
with the findings reported by Carstensen (1995) and others
(Rook, 1984) on Whites. Further, the significant but weak (Okun
& Keith, 1998) inverse relationship between emotional support
and negative interaction indicates that these dimensions are not
independent and that older African Americans can experience
both supportive and conflictual relationships with relatives and

friends simultaneously. The remainder of this section discusses
the correlates of emotional support and then turns to a con-
sideration of the factors associated with negative interaction.
Because of space constraints, and because the primary focus here
is on emotional support and negative interaction, findings related
to the correlates of personality and social contact (i.e., telephone
and face-to-face interaction) are not discussed.
Emotional Support
Emotional support from relatives and friends was associated
with personality, demographic, family status, and social contact
factors. Similar to research indicating that extraverts are more
likely than nonextraverts to socialize with network members
(Krause et al., 1990; Russell et al., 1997), extraverts in this
sample reported that they were more likely to receive emotional
support from relatives and friends. Neuroticism, in contrast,
was unrelated to emotional support from relatives and friends.
With regard to social and demographic status factors, age was
unrelated to reports of emotional support from relatives and
friends. Although predictions from socioemotional selectivity
theory suggest that age is associated with enhanced support
resources and positive appraisals of support relationships, it is
important to note that research findings are equivocal as to the
association between age and supportive relationships, noting
both increases (Carstensen, 1995; Lang et al., 1998) and
decreases in support with advanced age (Taylor, 1986). These
discrepancies could be attributed to the different types of
support measures that have been used in previous studies (e.g.,
social network size and relationship quality). Further, the null
findings in the present analysis could have resulted from using
a measure in which the focal support group combined relatives
and friends. In other words, socioemotional selectivity pro-
cesses may operate differentially in relation to specific groups
(e.g., relatives vs. friends). Additional refinements in measure-
ment may clarify both the relevant social support dimensions
(i.e., network size and relationship quality) and the focal groups
(i.e., kin vs. nonkin) involved in socioemotional selectivity
processes. Although socioemotional selectivity theory does not
focus on negative interactions, it is noteworthy that advanced
age was associated with lower levels of reported problematic
interactions with relatives and friends, suggesting that selec-
tivity processes may involve divergent and independent dimen-
sions of social relations.
Women in this study received more emotional support than
their male counterparts, a finding that is consistent with research
indicating that older Black women have more family and friends
who provide emotional assistance (Barker et al., 1998), receive
support from family members more frequently (Taylor, 1985),
and have a larger pool of available helpers when confronted with
a health problem (Chatters et al., 1985). Taken together, these
findings suggest that older women are advantaged with respect to
informal support networks (Antonucci, 1994). Persons who are
not married were less likely to receive emotional support from
relatives and friends than their married counterparts. The finding
is consistent with that of Lang and colleagues (1998) and others
(Krause et al., 1990) regarding the importance of social context
(e.g., availability of nuclear family) for emotional closeness.
However, previous work (Chatters et al., 1985, 1986) suggests
that in order to compensate for the absence of a spouse, unmarried
older Blacks were more likely than their counterparts to rely on
broader social networks (i.e., siblings, friends, and neighbors) for
assistance in the event of illness. Further, the lack of an effect of
parenthood on emotional support is at odds with socioemotional
selectivity theory and prior findings that adult children are
important for securing support from family (Taylor, 1985, 1986;
Taylor & Chatters, 1991). In this analysis, parents were no more
likely than nonparents to receive emotional support from
relatives and friends. As noted previously, discrepancies with
prior research may reflect differences in the measures of support
(e.g., potential helpers vs. enacted emotional support), as well as
the focal support group (relatives and friends) used. Further, the
present analysis specifically examined emotional support,
whereas prior research (e.g., Taylor, 1985, 1986) assessed
general support, which included instrumental assistance (e.g.,
help during illness and financial help) and emotional support.
Negative Interaction
Consistent with previous research, neuroticism was signifi-
cantly related to negative interaction with relatives and friends
(extraversion wasunrelated to negative interaction). Therelation-
ship between neuroticism and negative interaction may reflect
a complex interpersonal dynamic. Those with high levels of
neuroticism may respond to ambiguous social situations (e.g.,
Larsen & Ketelaar, 1991; McCrae & Costa, 1991) in ways that
generate negative social exchanges. For instance, because they
are more likely to engage in self-recrimination and doubt and
to be sensitive to ridicule, those with high levels of neuroticism
are easily disturbed by awkward social situations and tend to
perceive social interactions as negative. These reactions, in turn,
may create situations that elicit negative interactions with others.
Consistent with previous findings (e.g., Okun & Keith, 1998;
Pagel et al., 1987; Rook, 1984; Stephens et al., 1987), older
adults reported fewer negative interactions with relatives and
friends, compared with their younger counterparts. Socioemo-
tional selectivity theory would predict that because of increasing
awareness of mortality, the very old actively choose social
networks that emphasize intimate and positive emotional ties
and reduce contact with peripheral relationships. The current
investigation provided only limited evidence that gender is
associated with negative interaction. Although the direct gender
effect indicated that African American women experienced
fewer negative interactions than men, this was reduced to in-
significance once neuroticism and telephone and face-to-face
contact were taken into account. This finding is supported by the
work of others who report no gender differences in exposure to
negative interaction (e.g., Pagel et al., 1987; Stephens et al.,
1987).
Although previous studies report that education and negative
interaction are unrelated (e.g., Pagel et al., 1987; Rook, 1984),
the current findings indicated that older African Americans with
more education were more likely to report negative interaction
with relatives and friends. This finding is puzzling and suggests
that there may be circumstances in which the dynamics of
support exchanges and social interactions within social net-
works contribute to negative interactions. For example, persons
who have more social and economic resources (e.g., higher
educational level) and who are often expected to provide
assistance to others may find that traditional norms governing
social support to network members are burdensome. In these
instances, support providers may become overtaxed if asked to
EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND NEGATIVE INTERACTION S231
repeatedly provide assistance. In addition, unbalanced support
exchanges (e.g., lack of reciprocity) may generate negative
interactions between network members (DiMatteo & Hays,
1981), including providers' feelings of being unappreciated and
taken advantage of and recipients' feelings of indebtedness,
embarrassment, and being a burden. Additional research into
the dynamics of support exchanges may further clarify this
relationship. Finally, with respect to marital and parental
statuses, older African Americans who were married and had
children experienced fewer negative interactions with members
of their social network. This finding suggests that these social
roles confer certain advantages on older adults with respect to
supportive exchanges and interactions vis-a
`-vis their social
networks (Krause et al., 1990). In particular, children are
reliable sources of social support (Chatters et al., 1986), buffer
the adverse effects of negative social interactions with relatives
and friends (Okun & Keith, 1998), and broker supportive re-
lationships and social interactions with others (Taylor, 1985,
1986). Further, Krause and colleagues (1990) noted that being
married is an important correlate of the use of social support in
later life.
Contrary to expectations (Krause et al., 1990; Taylor, 1985,
1986), the findings indicated that neither face-to-face nor
telephone contact directly influenced emotional support or
negative interaction among older Black adults. Previous
multivariate analyses (Krause et al., 1990) examining person-
ality and social contact factors (combining visits and contact
by telephone and mail) in relation to emotional support from
family or friends indicated that contact with family predicted
received emotional support, whereas contact with friends and
social extraversion were unrelated to support. Similarly, Lang
and associates (1998) noted that extraversion is related to social
network size but not the number of emotionally close re-
lationships of older adults. In the present study, the significant
effects for personality factors would seem to indicate that
personality, rather than social contact, is of relatively greater
importance for determining social interaction. Further in-
vestigation is needed to clarify the independent effects of
personality and social contact factors on discrete measures
of social networks and relationships. Finally, the pattern of
findings in which extraversion predicted emotional support and
neuroticism predicted negative interaction is worthy of note and
suggests that dimensions of personality are domain specific
with respect to their effects on social interactions (see Ingersoll-
Dayton et al., 1997). That is to say, elements of personality that
embody negative traits (i.e., neuroticism) predict negative
social interactions, whereas positive aspects of personality (i.e.,
extraversion) are associated with positive social interactions.
Study Limitations
An interpretation of these findings should be considered within
the context of the study's strengths and limitations. First, there are
acknowledged limitations associated with the measures of social
interaction available in the Americans' Changing Lives data set.
As opposed to source-specific measures of negative interaction
and emotional support from spouse, children, and parents, this
analysis used global measures to assess relationships with
nonimmediate family members and nonkin (i.e., relatives and
friends combined). The use of the source-specific measures
focusing on spouse, children, and parents, although providing
more discrete information, would have limited sample selection
criteria to respondents who are married, have adult children, or
have a living parent. These stipulations would have severely
restricted sample size and prohibited the use of more rigorous
statistical techniques (structural equation modeling) in testing
these relationships. The measures assessing interactions with
relatives and friends were the most generous with respect
to sample size considerations, and thus they were preferred for
this initial investigation of these issues among older African
Americans. Furthermore, given the prominence of extended
family and nonkin relations for supportive exchanges among
African Americans, it is important to examine these relationships
involving relatives and friends, particularly among older adults.
This investigation only assessed two dimensions of person-
ality. Given that the influence of personality on social inter-
actions among older African Americans has received little
attention in the literature, it is possible that other personality
dimensions may be contributing to observed relationships.
For example, there is evidence that individuals high in agree-
ableness are more likely to interpret their interactions as less
confrontational and perceive their networks as supportive
(Graziano & Eisenberg, 1997) and that agreeableness is linked
to positive and negative social interactions in ways similar
to extraversion and neuroticism (Finch & Graziano, 2001).
However, given the dearth of literature in this area that focuses
on African Americans in general and older Blacks in particular,
the current study provides initial empirical evidence that at least
two dimensions of personality are linked to social interaction in
important ways.
Conclusions
The present analysis found that factors associated with
emotional support and negative interaction were distinct. Future
research should continue this line of investigation in distin-
guishing between the correlates of emotional support and neg-
ative interaction and, further, identify particular factors (e.g.,
intense support needs or poverty status) that potentially expose
older adults to negative interactions with social networks.
Despite the several innovations used in this study, the model
tested is preliminary and in need of elaboration. Further investi-
gations of the proposed relationships should consider other
sources (e.g., spouse or children) and types of social support
(e.g., instrumental assistance) and negative interaction (e.g.,
manipulation), as well as other important factors related to
social interaction, such as stressful events.
Investigations of this sort will help us to more fully under-
stand the processes that influence social support and negative
interaction with the social networks of older African Americans.
