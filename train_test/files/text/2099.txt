Abstract
Fiber-rich diets are associated with favorable lipid profiles, but the specific compounds and the mechanisms behind
this effect are yet to be fully understood. Lignans are fiber-related polyphenols that have been associated with lower
prevalence of cardiovascular disease. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between dietary lignan
exposure, measured as the urinary concentration of their metabolites, enterolactone and enterodiol, and serum lipids in
a representative sample of U.S. adults. We carried out a cross-sectional analysis of data from 1492 adults who participated
in the 1999­2004 NHANES. The mean urinary concentration of enterolignans in U.S. adults was 1.9 mmol/L. The multivariate-
adjusted mean differences comparing the highest and lowest enterolignan tertile were 0.06 mmol/L for HDL cholesterol and
20.17 mmol/L for TG (P , 0.05). In spline regression models, we also found an inverse association between serum TG and
urinary enterolignan concentrations. Serum HDL cholesterol levels increased linearly with increasing enterolignan concen-
trations. Modest or no associations were found between enterolignan concentrations and serum LDL cholesterol or total
cholesterol. In conclusion, enterolignan concentrations are associated with lower serum TG concentrations and greater HDL
cholesterol concentrations in U.S. adults. J. Nutr. 142: 751­756, 2012.
Introduction
Dietary lignans are commonly present in the human diet and are
especially abundant in oilseeds, cereals, and cruciferous vegeta-
bles (1­3). After ingestion, a major fraction of dietary lignans
undergo an extensive metabolism by the gut microflora that
results in the formation of 2 major metabolites, END3 and ENL
(4), which are generally called enterolignans attending to their
colonic origin. When these compounds were first discovered,
they were classified as phytoestrogens according to their
resemblance to endogenous 17b-estradiol and based upon
studies reporting an interaction between these compounds and
the human endocrine system (5). In women, urinary ENL has
been positively and significantly associated with sex hormone-
binding globulin and negatively associated with plasma free
estradiol, free testosterone (6,7) and 5-reductase enzymes (8).
Observational prospective studies have suggested that high
levels of circulating ENL are associated with lower risks of acute
cardiovascular events. One of the first studies associating serum
ENL concentrations with cardiovascular disease was a nested
study within the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor
Study. In a case-control design, men in the highest ENL quartile
had a 65.3% (95% CI: 11.9, 86.3) lower risk of an acute
coronary event than men in the lowest quartile after adjusting
for the strongest predictive risk factors (9). This study was then
followed by other prospective analyses of the Kuopio Ischaemic
Heart Disease Risk Factor Study cohort (mean 12 y) from which
significant associations were again found between high levels of
serum ENL and reduced risk of chronic heart disease and CVD
deaths (10). Within the Antioxidant Supplementation in Ather-
osclerosis Prevention study, serum F2-isoprostane levels were
found to decrease linearly across quintiles of serum ENL after
adjustment for other dietary antioxidants (11). More recently, a
nonsignificant association was found in a prospective study of
male smokers in Finland where the OR (highest vs. lowest
quintile) for nonfatal myocardial infarction and chronic heart
disease-related death according to serum ENL were 0.67 (95%
CI: 0.37, 1.23) and 0.57 (95% CI: 0.26, 1.25), respectively (12).
The latest report was a nested case-control study within the
prospective Netherlands Monitoring Project on CVD. Selecting
236 cases (nonfatal myocardial infarction) and 283 matching
(age, sex, and study center) controls from the original cohort, the
authors found a nonsignificant tendency toward a positive
association [OR (highest vs. lowest quartile) = 1.51, (95% CI:

factors (13).
Circulating ENL levels have been positively associated with
dietary fiber, diets low in fat and rich in fruits and vegetables,
and healthier lifestyle habits (14­16). This association may
explain the favorable results obtained in the aforementioned
studies, but a putative role of these metabolites cannot be ruled
out, because the relationship between enterolignan excretion
and intermediate cardiovascular risk markers is not yet clearly
understood. The objective of the present study was to assess the
association between exposure to dietary lignans measured by
their urinary metabolites (enterolignans) and plasma lipid levels,
a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease, using data from
the NHANES during the years 1999­2004.
Materials and Methods
Study population. The NHANES, which is the responsibility of the
U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, comprises a series of complex,
multi-stage probability samples that represent the civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized U.S. population. In brief, primary sampling units (mostly
counties) were selected and divided into segments (generally city blocks
or their equivalent). Households within each segment were listed and a
sample was randomly drawn. Individuals were chosen to participate in
NHANES from a list of all persons residing in selected households. In
geographic areas where the proportion of age, ethnic, or income groups
that were selected for oversampling was high, the probability of selection
for those groups was greater than in other areas; therefore, individuals
were drawn at random within designated age-sex-race/ethnicity screen-
ing subdomains (17). The 1999­2004 NHANES study protocols were
approved by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics Institutional
Review Board and oral and written informed consent was obtained from
all participants. The overall participation rate in NHANES 1999­2004
interviews and physical examinations was 70.3%, corresponding to a
total of 31,126 participants (18).
The NHANES 1999­2004 measures of urinary lignans were ob-
tained from approximately one-third of the subsample of persons 6 y and
older selected at random (n = 7999). Specific sample weights for this
subsample (phthalate subsample MEC weights) (19­21) were used when
analyzing these data. From this subsample, we further excluded
participants younger than 20 y old, leaving 4206 individuals, from
which 427 women, who were either pregnant or missing information
about menopausal status or hormone-replacement medication use, were
also excluded due to possible interaction with the allegedly estrogenic
effect of ENL. Any component altering intestinal flora or its environment
has the potential to affect the degree to which precursors are converted to
enterolignans (22), so we further eliminated 93 participants reporting
antibiotic use 1 mo prior to participating in the survey. A total of 2059
participants missing values for serum lipids were also excluded along with
an additional 110 participants who were missing any other study
covariates. A final sample of 1492 participants remained available for
analysis.
General data collection. NHANES 1999­2004 baseline data were
collected during an in-home interview and a subsequent visit to a MEC.
During the in-home interview, information on age, sex, race/ethnicity,
and education was collected using a standardized questionnaire. Other
data collected during the in-home interview included education, house-
hold income, physical activity, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption,
current medication use, and menopausal status. BMI was obtained by
dividing measured weight in kilograms by measured height in meters
squared. Serum cotinine was measured using the isotope-dilution HLPC-
Atmospheric-pressure Chemical Ionization MS method. Physical activity
was defined as metabolic energy turnover/week using variables having
information for number of times the activity was done over the past 30 d,
mean number of minutes the activity was done, and metabolic equivalent
score for the activity. Urine creatinine was determined using a Jaffe
´
reaction measured with a CX3 analyzer (Beckman Coulter).
Urinary enterolignans. The urine collection procedure consisted of
urine specimen collection and processing and pregnancy testing. Fasting
status was also recorded and only data from participants who fasted at
least 9 h were considered. Urine specimens were collected from partici-
pants in standard urine collection cups. Samples were immediately
refrigerated and transferred to specimen vials within 4 h of collection. A
minimum of 5 mL of urine was collected and stored in borosilicate glass or
polypropylene vials or specimen cups, immediately frozen at 2208C, and
stored on dry ice for shipping. Two comparable methods for the
determination of lignans were used. During the 1999­2002 surveys,
analyses were performed by HPLC-APCI-MS building on the Barnes et al.
(23) method for phytoestrogens (19,20). During the 2003­2004 surveys,
lignans were analyzed at the CDC's Division of Laboratory of Sciences
(method no. 4060.01) by HPLC Electrospray Ionization MS (21). Both
methods include enzymatic deconjugation of the lignans followed by solid-
phase extraction, reverse-phase HPLC to resolve the analytes, and MS
detection using internal isotope-labeled standards to guarantee the
accuracy of the measurements. The limit of detection was 1.0 nmol/L (24).
Serum lipids. Blood samples were drawn by a trained phlebotomist
over EDTA and stored under appropriate refrigerated (4­88C) and frozen
(2208C) conditions until used. Serum total cholesterol and TG were
measured enzymatically (24) and HDL cholesterol was directly assessed
after exclusion of apoB lipoproteins. LDL cholesterol was calculated
from measured values of total cholesterol, TG, and HDL cholesterol
according to the relationship [LDL] = [total cholesterol] 2 [HDL] 2
[TG]/5, where [TG]/5 is an estimate of VLDL cholesterol (24). Although
recent food intake exerts little effect on total cholesterol in plasma, TG
are increased in postprandial plasma to the extent that is related to the
amount of fat consumed. This is due to the appearance of chylomicrons
in the circulation after a fat-containing meal. Chylomicrons are normally
cleared within 9­12 h and no chylomicrons should be present after a 12-
h period of fasting. Transient decreases in HDL cholesterol and LDL
cholesterol also occur, the magnitude of which depends on the fat
content of the meal (24). We considered only values of serum lipids
measured in specimens drawn from participants who have fasted at least
9 h before venipuncture.
Dietary assessment. The dietary interview component, called What
We Eat in America, was conducted as a partnership between the USDA
and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Since the 2003­
2004 survey, NHANES has released 2 d of intake data for each
participant. The first day (d 1) is collected in the MEC and d 2 is collected
by telephone 3­10 d later. Mean values of the 2 d were used for the
analysis.
Statistical methods. All the statistical analyses were performed using the
open-source statistical scripting language R, version 2.13.0 (R Develop-
ment Core Team) (25). We used the R survey package, which includes
specific functions to fit the generalized linear model to data from a
complex survey design, with inverse-probability weighting and design-
based SE (26,27). Participants were divided in tertiles of enterolignans
based on the weighted study sample population distribution. The
unadjusted linear model (model 1) and multivariate linear models with
different degree of adjustment were used to study the association between
serum lipid concentrations and urinary enterolignan levels. Adjusting
variables were defined a priori based on the research hypothesis. Model 2
was adjusted by sex, age (using covariates defined by a restricted quadratic
splines), race/ethnicity, education level, income, and creatinine (log
transformed) to account for urine volume standardization. Model 3 was
further adjusted for BMI (restricted quadratic spline transformation),
smoking, alcohol intake, menopausal status, use of hormonal replacement
therapy and cotinine (log transformed), fiber intake, total cholesterol
intake, and physical activity. An additional censored regression model used
to discard the potential lack of power induced by models 2 and 3 by
correcting for the effect of lipid lowering medication (28) was fitted using
the cnreg command in STATA (version 10.0; Research Triangle Institute).
We also assessed the presence of interactions between urinary ENL and
sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, BMI, smoking status, and alcohol
intake. To study the form of the relationship between lipid concentrations

and urinary lignan concentrations, we fitted an additional linear model
using restricted quadratic splines with knots defined at the 5th, 50th, and
95th percentiles of the enterolignan distribution (29). The regression spline
model was adjusted by the same confounders used in model 2. P values in
Table 1 correspond to the F tests for homogeneity of the means obtained
using the regTermTest function of the survey package (26,27). Standard
diagnostic checks on the residuals from the fitted models showed no
evidence of failure on the assumption of normality and homogeneity of the
residual variance.
Results
A substantial number of eligible participants were excluded
from the original study population, mostly due to the limited
availability of enterolignan data. To account for possible
selection bias, we used the provided specific subsample weight
(phthalate subsample MEC weights) (19­21) in the statistical
design. We also assessed the possible error introduced by the use
of two different analytical methods for measuring urinary
enterolignan concentrations depending on the year of the
NHANES survey (19­21). No comparison between them has
been reported in the NHANES protocols and it is also not
possible to calculate the appropriate validation parameters due
to the lack of repeated measures. Nevertheless, the mean
difference between urinary enterolignan concentrations mea-
sured with the first method (NHANES 1999­2002) compared
with the second (NHANES 2003­2004) was ~0.004 mmol/L,
which cannot be considered biologically relevant.
Geometric mean urinary END and ENL concentrations were
0.17 and 1.28 mmol/L, respectively, with wide ranges in the subset
studied, in agreement with previous studies (14,30­32). The
median urinary enterolignan concentration was 1.94 mmol/L,
with 83% of it ENL (Table 1). The concentrations of enter-
olignans were significantly higher in the urine of participants with
higher education and lower in obese individuals (Table 1).
Enterolignan concentrations are strongly associated with fiber
intake, smoking status (former or never smokers), and physical
activity levels (Table 1).
We used multivariate linear models to estimate adjusted
mean differences in serum lipid concentrations between the
second or 3rd tertiles and the first tertile of urinary enterolignan
concentration (Table 2). No interaction between urinary enter-
olignans and sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, BMI, smoking
status, or alcohol intake was observed. The overall trend was for
a significant decrease in serum TG and an increase in HDL
cholesterol between tertiles 1 and 3 of urinary enterolignans.
The estimated linear regression coefficients quantifying the
linear relationship between TG and HDL cholesterol with log-
enterolignans were also significant. Because the urine enter-
olignan concentrations were log transformed, the expected mean
differences in TG concentrations, holding the other predictor
variables constant, for a 50% increase in enterolignan concen-
tration would be 20.06 3 log(1.50) = 20.024 mmol/L
according to model 2 (Table 2). The decrease in serum TG
concentrations according to increasing concentrations of urinary
enterolignans was significant only when comparing tertiles 1 and
3 (P = 0.004) for model 2 and the same applies to the increment
in HDL cholesterol (P = 0.04). No association was found
between other serum lipids and enterolignans (Table 2) and no
further differences were observed after fitting a censored
regression model to correct for the effect of lipid-lowering
medication (28) (results not shown).

To further examine a possible nonlinear association between
the variables, we fitted spline regression models. The estimated
curves and 95% CI representing the shape of the relationship
between urinary enterolignan concentrations and levels of serum
lipids are shown in Figure 1. A negative, nonlinear association
between serum TG, LDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol and
urinary enterolignans was found while the concentration of
HDL cholesterol increased steadily according to increasing
values of urinary enterolignans.
Discussion
The best approach when assessing dietary lignan exposure is to
use plasmatic (33) or urinary ENL as a biologic marker.
Reproducibility of a single measurement of urinary ENL has
recently been found to be adequate over a 3-y period (ICC =
0.52) within the Nurses' Health Study (34) and has also been
correlated with 24-h urine ENL (ICC = 0.65) in the SU.VI.MAX
cohort (35). Additionally, because END presents a shorter
elimination half-life (36) and ENL production is also highly
dependent on individual gut microflora (37), it has been
suggested that the use of the pooled concentrations of END
and ENL are a better reflection of dietary lignan exposure (38).
Using this approach for assessing dietary lignan exposure in
our study, we found an inverse and nonlinear association with
serum TG and a positive linear association for HDL cholesterol
and urinary enterolignan concentrations. The differences found,
although significant, were small and biologic implications should
be considered cautiously, although in the case of HDL choles-
terol, the linear relationship we found deserves further attention.
High-fiber diets have been associated with a decreased risk of
CVD by the reduction of serum total cholesterol and LDL
cholesterol concentrations (39,40), but dietary fiber seems to
have little effect on HDL cholesterol or TG (41). In this report,
urinary enterolignan concentrations are associated with a favor-
able effect on these later fractions, suggesting a complementary
effect to dietary fiber and supporting previous findings on lignan-
rich diets and cardioprotective effects (42). No association
between plasma enterolignans and HDL cholesterol was found in
a nested case-control study within the prospective Netherlands
Monitoring Project on CVD (13). The same results were derived
from 2 cross-sectional studies in which no association with blood
lipids was found (43,44). These studies estimated lignan expo-
sure by dietary assessment and considered only the lignans
known at the time. It was long thought that secoisolariciresinol
and matairesinol were the only 2 lignans commonly present in
food, but it is now known that these compounds account for only
a minor percentage of the total lignan content (2,45), and
therefore dietary lignan intakes have been underestimated. Using
the same estimation through dietary assessment, a weak associ-
ation was found between lignan intake and aortic stiffness in
postmenopausal women in the PROSPECT study (46), and no
association (high vs. low quartile of plant lignan intake) was
found for coronary events [OR = 0.92 (95% CI: 0.65, 1.29)] or
total CVD-related outcomes [OR = 0.89 (95% CI: 0.66, 1.19)] in
Dutch postmenopausal women within the European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study (47). Associations
derived from studies relying on dietary lignan intake calculation,
and especially those dependent on the first developed lignan
databases, should be revised for consistency. Using urinary
concentrations as a biomarker for dietary lignan intake, we
found that an increasing excretion of enterolignan is associated
with decreased levels of serum TG and increased levels of serum
HDL cholesterol in U.S. adults after adjusting for all major
confounders.
Because the ENL metabolism seems to be related to that of
endogenous estradiol, it has been hypothesized that ENL could
modulate steroid hormones through competition for the estrogen

1 Values are mean adjusted differences (95% CI). HRT, hormone replacement therapy.
2 Values are the mean urine enterolignan concentration.
3 b is the regression coefficient between the corresponding serum lipid and log-enterolignan, e.g., the expected mean differences in TG concentrations according to model 2,
holding the other predictor variables constant, for a 50% increase in enterolignan concentration would be 20.06 3 log(1.50) = 20.024 mmol/L.
4 Comparison to first tertile.
5 Values are the mean serum lipid concentration of each enterolignan tertile. Model 1: unadjusted regression model. Model 2: adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, education, income,
and urinary creatinine (log-transformed). Model 3: further adjusted for smoking and alcohol categories, menopause status, use of HRT, BMI, physical activity, and dietary intake of
saturated fat, cholesterol, and fiber.

receptors, or estrogen carriers (sex-hormone binding globulin)
and therefore influence the estrogen levels available for hormone-
dependent tissues (6,48). Effects on macrophage lipid accumula-
tion (49), cellular cholesterol metabolism (50), and inhibition of
LDL oxidation (51,52) have also been proposed as plausible
mechanisms by which dietary compounds with estrogenic activity
may protect against the development of atherosclerosis. Because
of the heterogeneous nature of the estrogen receptors (53), the
effects of enterolignans on the cardiovascular system are likely
to be complex and not limited to the favorable changes of the
lipid profile seen in this study. The additive and synergistic
effects of active phytochemicals such as lignans found in whole
grains may be partly responsible for the health benefits
associated with fiber-rich foods.

(B), LDL cholesterol (C), and total cholesterol (D) by log urine
enterolignan concentrations in U.S. adults (n = 1492). Values are
adjusted mean differences (95% CI). Enterolignan concentrations
were modeled as restricted quadratic splines with nodes at the 5th,
50th, and 95th percentiles. The multivariable linear regression models
were adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, education level, income,
