Improving the Adverse Childhood
Experiences Study Scale
David Finkelhor, PhD; Anne Shattuck, MA; Heather Turner, PhD; Sherry Hamby, PhD
Objective: To test and improve upon the list of adverse
childhood experiences from the Adverse Childhood Ex-
periences (ACE) Study scale by examining the ability of a
broader range to correlate with mental health symptoms.
Design: Nationally representative sample of children and
adolescents.
Setting and Participants: Telephone interviews with
a nationally representative sample of 2030 youth aged
10 to 17 years who were asked about lifetime adversities
and current distress symptoms.
Main Outcome Measures: Lifetime adversities and
current distress symptoms.
Results: The adversities from the original ACE scale items
were associated with mental health symptoms among the
participants, but the association was significantly im-
proved (from R2=0.21 to R2=0.34) by removing some of
the original ACE scale items and adding others in the do-
mains of peer rejection, peer victimization, community
violence exposure, school performance, and socio-
economic status.
Conclusions: Our understanding of the most harmful
childhood adversities is still incomplete because of com-
plex interrelationships among them, but we know enough
to proceed to interventional studies to determine whether
prevention and remediation can improve long-term
outcomes.

THE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD
Experiences (ACE) Study1
has attracted considerable
scientific and policy atten-
tion in recent years, in part
because it suggests that potentially pre-
ventable childhood experiences, particu-
larly physical and sexual abuse and ne-
glect, may increase a person's risk for
serious health problems and higher mor-
tality rates much later in life.
The study has demonstrated relation-
ships between adverse childhood expe-
riences and many adult health risks.1-10
These results, which have been pub-
lished widely in the health sciences, are
based on a survey and medical records
of more than 17 000 members of the
Kaiser Health Plan in San Diego, Cali-
fornia.1,11
Nonetheless, research using the ACE
Study model has some important limita-
tions, in part because of the retrospective
way in which data on childhood adversi-
ties have been gathered. The average age
of respondents when they supplied infor-
mation about their childhood experi-
ences was 55 to 57 years. As a result, it is
hard to be certain, particularly from such
a remote vantage, whether it is these par-
ticular childhood experiences or unmea-
sured covariates that are the most impor-
tant predictors. In addition, the ACE
Study list of preventable childhood
adversities omits certain domains judged
by many developmental researchers to be
important in predicting long-term health
and well-being outcomes. Among the
predictors missing from the ACE Study
model are peer rejection, exposure to
violence outside the family, low socio-
economic status, and poor academic
performance.
For example, longitudinal studies show
that growing up in poverty increases life-
long risk for various negative life events
and negative health outcomes.12-14 Peer re-
jection and lack of friends are associated
with the development of many disor-
ders.15-17 Poor school performance in child-
hood is associated with poor outcomes in
adulthood, such as unemployment.18 Wit-

dren.19,20 These major childhood adversities are not cur-
rently measured by the ACE scale.
In addition, measuring childhood adversities during
childhood, rather than later, may offer other improve-
ments to the ACE Study's early life predictors of health
outcomes.21 It allows the possibility of obtaining a more
accurate and comprehensive assessment of childhood
events than one would be able to obtain after many years.
It also would allow a more sensitive untangling of the
relationship among various adversities in ways that bet-
ter explain causal sequences.

Thus, in the present study, we tried to replicate the
ACE Study findings in a cohort of youth, using psycho-
logical distress as an outcome measure, and to explore
whether the adversities enumerated by the ACE Study
could be improved upon by considering a more compre-
hensive range of possible adversities, including some of
the domains not considered in the ACE Study.
METHODS
PARTICIPANTS
These analyses use data from the National Survey of Chil-
dren's Exposure to Violence (NatSCEV),25 a representative
sample of US children and adolescents. The NatSCEV was de-
signed to obtain incidence and prevalence estimates for a wide
range of childhood victimizations and other adversities. The
survey was conducted between January 2008 and May 2008 with
a nationally representative sample of 4549 children aged 0 to
17 years living in the contiguous United States. Interviews with
parents and youth were conducted over the telephone by the
employees of an experienced survey research firm.
The foundation of the design was a nationwide sampling
frame of residential telephone numbers from which a sample
of telephone households was drawn by random digit dialing.
This nationally representative cross section yielded 3053 of the
4549 completed interviews. To ensure that the study included
a sizable proportion of racial/ethnic minorities and low-
income respondents for more accurate subgroup analyses, there
was also an oversampling of US telephone exchanges that had
a population of 70% or more of African American, Hispanic,
or low-income households. This oversample yielded the re-
maining 1496 of the completed interviews. Sample weights were
calculated to adjust for differential probability of selection as-
sociated with (1) study design, (2) demographic variations in
nonresponse, and (3) variations in within-household eligibil-
ity. For this study, we analyzed a subsample of the entire sample
of 4549 respondents. This subsample consisted of 2030 youth
who were aged 10 to 17 years at the time of the interview and
for whom complete data were available on the variables of in-
terest. Analyses in this study are weighted by the sample weights.
PROCEDURE
Ashortinterviewwasconductedwithanadultcaregiver(usually
a parent) in each household to obtain family demographic infor-
mation. One child was randomly selected from all eligible chil-
dren living in a household by choosing the child with the most
recent birthday. If the selected child was aged 10 to 17 years, the

RESPONSE RATES
AND NONRESPONSE ANALYSES
The cooperation rate for the random digit dialing cross-
section portion of the survey was 71%, and the response rate
was 54%. The cooperation and response rates associated with
the smaller oversample were somewhat lower at 63% and 43%,
respectively. These are good rates by current survey research
standards.26-30 Although the potential for response bias re-
mains an important consideration, several recent studies and
our own analysis25 have shown no meaningful association be-
tween response rates and response bias.31-34
MEASUREMENT
Victimization and Adversity
This survey used an enhanced version of the Juvenile Victim-
ization Questionnaire, an inventory of childhood victimiza-
tion.35-37 The Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire obtains re-
ports on 48 forms of youth victimization covering 5 general areas
of interest: conventional crime, maltreatment, victimization by
peer and siblings, sexual victimization, and witnessing and ex-
posure to violence.38 The survey also contains questions about
adverse life events in the parent interview section and in a sepa-
rate section on adversity.
For the present study, which was not originally designed
to test the ACE Study model, we selected victimization and ad-
versity items in 2 steps. First, we used screener items and their
associated follow-up questions to construct victimization types
that most closely matched the abuse and neglect items in the
original ACE Study, and we chose family background and ad-
versity items to match the household dysfunction items of the
original ACE Study. Using these items, we constructed a rep-
lication of the original ACE Study. In the second step, we se-
lected additional types of victimization and adversity items not
included in the original ACE Study but that are known to be
important correlates of health and well-being outcomes. The
measures selected in these 2 steps are described in the next sec-
tion of this article. Important differences from the ACE Study
items are noted in eTable 1 (http://www.jamapeds.com).

Measures Used to Replicate
Original ACE Study Items
The following measures were coded 0 for no and 1 for yes so
that they could be summed to create the replicated ACE Study
items. All are lifetime measures.
v Emotional abuse: One item asked respondents, "At any
time in your life, did you get scared or feel really bad because
grown-ups in your life called you names, said mean things to
you, or said they didn't want you?"
v Physical abuse: Several screeners assessed the child's ex-
perience of physical assault. Children who answered yes to any
of these assault screeners were coded as having experienced
physical abuse if the incident was perpetrated by parent, an adult
relative, or another adult caregiver.
v Sexual abuse: Four screeners asked about the child's ex-
perience of sexual assault or attempted rape by a known adult,
an adult stranger, or a peer or sibling.
v Emotional neglect: Four questions about family social sup-
port were used to construct an indicator of emotional neglect.
These items are shown in eTable 1. Total scores ranged from 4
to 16. Children whose family support score was 10 or lower
were coded as having experienced emotional neglect.
v Physical neglect: A single item asked whether the child had
ever experienced a time when adults in his or her life "didn't take
careofthemthewaytheyshould,"includingnotprovidingenough
food, not taking them to the doctor when they were sick, or not
making sure they had a safe place to stay. Children who an-
swered yes were coded as having experienced physical neglect.
v Mother treated violently: Twelve screeners asked chil-
dren whether they had witnessed specific kinds of violence and
abuse. Children who answered yes to any of these questions
and who reported that their mother was the victim were coded
1 on this item.
v Household substance abuse: A single item assessed whether
the child had a family member who "drank or used drugs so
often that it caused problems."
v Household mental illness: Children who had a parent or
sibling with depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, or "other psy-
chiatric disorder" (information obtained from the parent in-
terview) or children who had "someone close" attempt sui-
cide were coded 1 on household mental illness.
v Parental separation or divorce: We coded any respondent
who was not currently living with 2 biological or adoptive par-
ents as having experienced parental separation or divorce.
v Incarcerated household member: One adversity item asks
whether a parent or guardian had ever been sent to prison.
Additional Victimization and Adversity Items
Not Included in ACE Study
The measures listed herein, not included in the ACE Study, were
examined as additional correlates of children's distress. A sum-
mary of these items is reported in eTable 2. Unless otherwise
specified, questions regarding these items were asked in the
child's portion of the interview:
v Peer victimization (assault, physical intimidation, or emo-
tional victimization by a nonsibling peer)
v Parents always arguing (respondents were asked whether
there was a time in their lives when their parents were always
arguing)
v Property victimization (experience of a robbery, theft, or
vandalism by a nonsibling perpetrator)
v Someone close to the child had a bad accident or illness
v Exposure to community violence (6 screeners asked
whether the child had been exposed to certain types of crime
and violence, including witnessing an assault, experiencing a
household theft, having someone close murdered, witnessing
a murder, experiencing a riot, or being in a war zone)
v No good friends (child had no "really good friends at
school" at the time of the interview)
v Below-average grades (parent reported that the child had
"below-average" grades in school)
v Someone close to the child died because of an accident
or illness
v Parent lost job (children reported that there was a time
when their "mother, father, or guardian lost a job or couldn't
find work")
v Parent deployed to war zone (parent had to leave the coun-
try to fight in a war and was gone for several months or longer)
v Disaster (child had experienced a "very bad fire, flood, tor-
nado, hurricane, earthquake, or other disaster")
v Removed from family (child was "sent or taken away from
his or her family for any reason")
v Very overweight (parent reported that the child was "quite
a bit overweight" compared with other boys/girls his or her age)
v Physical disability (parent reported that the child had been
diagnosed with a "physical health or medical problem that af-
fects the kinds of activities that he or she can do")
v Ever involved in a bad accident
v Neighborhood violence is a "big problem" (asked in the
parent interview)
v Homelessness (a time when the child's family "had to live
on a street or in a shelter because they had no other place to stay")
v Repeated a grade
v Less masculine or feminine than other boys or girls his
or her age (asked in the parent interview)
Distress Symptoms
Distress symptoms were measured using shortened versions of
the anger, depression, anxiety, dissociation, and posttrau-
matic stress scales of the Trauma Symptoms Checklist for Chil-
dren (TSCC).39 Respondents were asked how often they had
experienced each symptom within the past month. Response
options were on a 4-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very
often), and responses from the items of all 5 scales were summed
to create a total distress score consisting of 28 items. The Cron-
bach  value for total distress score in this study was 0.93.
Demographics
Demographic information was obtained in the initial parent in-
terview, including the child's sex, age (in years), race/
ethnicity (coded into 4 groups: white non-Hispanic, black non-
Hispanic, other non-Hispanic, and Hispanic any race),
socioeconomic status (SES), and place size of the child's town
or city of residence. Socioeconomic status is a continuous com-
posite score based on the sum of the standardized household
income and standardized parental educational level (for the par-
ent with the highest educational level) scores, which was then
restandardized. For our revised version of the ACE scale, we
created a dummy indicator for low SES that flags children whose
continuous SES value fell in the bottom, roughly 20%.
RESULTS
The ACE scale constructed with variables from NatSCEV
that mimic the original items is associated with distress
levels among youth aged 10 to 17 years, as measured by
the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children. Model 1
in Table 1 reports the regression of distress scores on

the items from the replicated ACE scale. The cumula-
tive items were strongly associated with distress, and there
was a clear dose-response relationship between the ad-
versities and distress, as has been demonstrated in pre-
vious research.1
However, the original ACE scale items did not each
make an independent contribution to distress as illus-
trated in model 1 of Table 1. Two items, parental separa-
tion or divorce and incarceration of a household mem-
ber, were not significant in the regression model of the
whole scale. In addition, when other childhood adversi-
ties (not considered in the ACE studies) were added to the
model (model 2 of Table 1), several ACE scale items
droppedbelowsignificance.Moreover,severaloftheadded
childhood adversities showed strong associations with dis-
tress. These included peer victimization, property victim-
ization, parents always arguing, having no good friends,
having someone close with a bad illness or accident, SES,
and exposure to community violence.
A revised ACE scale was then constructed, removing
the original items that were no longer significant in the
extended model. Significant new items were added to the
scale, including parents always arguing, having no good
friends, having someone close with a bad illness or ac-
cident, peer victimization, property victimization, and ex-
posure to community violence. The old and new scales
are contrasted in Table 2. Regression with the new scale
determined R2 = 0.34 vs R2 = 0.21 for the original ver-
sion of the scale.
COMMENT
In this study, it was possible to improve the value of the
original ACE scale considerably by adding some child-
hood adversities not included in the original scale and
excluding others that were in the scale. The value of add-
ing several items not considered in the ACE studies is
consistent with several publications showing their harm-
ful effect on child development. In fact, there are likely
even more domains of childhood adversity that might be
measured and added that could further improve its pre-
dictive ability, for example, low IQ,40 parental death, and
food scarcity. The present study illustrates that the origi-
nal ACE scale could likely be improved even more with
additional developmental research.
However, this analysis also confirms that some of the
key ACE scale items, particularly the child maltreat-
ment exposures, remain very important and make dis-
crete independent contributions, even when many other
adversities are considered. Moreover, several of the new

adversities identified in this study are additional forms
of interpersonal victimization--property crime, peer vic-
timization, and exposure to community violence--
which reinforce findings from other studies41,42 high-
lighting the cumulative harm of different forms of
childhood victimization.
There are several limitations of the current study that
bear emphasis. First, this study did not operationalize the
adverse childhood events in the same way that the origi-
nal ACE instrument did. Second, the dependent vari-
able, the TSCC, used in this exercise was not an out-
come used in the original ACE Study. The TSCC may be
better associated with the impact of some childhood
events, such as violence exposure, than others and may
not necessarily be reflective of what would best predict
long-term health effects. In fact, some childhood adver-
sities may affect later health not through psychological
processes, such as distress symptoms, but through other
mechanisms, for example, failure to receive proper early
health care. Moreover, unlike the ACE Study, the out-
come measure was short term and the causal sequence
between adversities and outcome cannot be assumed. All
the variables in this study come from self-report and, in
most cases, from children, which may be inaccurate and
introduce method associations.
Before additional work on the ACE scale is under-
taken, some important issues are worth discussing, even
beyond the findings of the current study. One issue con-
cerns what the goal or best use of this or related scales
should be. One possible use for this kind of scale is as a
risk assessment tool with older adolescents or adults to
help health care providers better understand who is most
likely to require services and treatment for health prob-
lems. However, the goal for which the scale has been most
widely used to date is to advocate for and influence pre-
vention policies by highlighting crucial developmental
factors that prevention programs should target to im-
prove general health and reduce medical costs and so-
cial service expenditures.22,43,44
In many ways the first goal, risk assessment, is a much
easier one to accomplish than the second, selection of pre-
vention targets. To successfully satisfy the first goal, re-
search has to find strong associations between risk indi-
cators and later outcomes. The ACE scale seems clearly
successful at this. For the second goal, however, a good risk
indicator is not sufficient. The indicator has to be a proven
causal contributor, which modified would make a differ-
ence. Much of the discussion about the ACE scale as-
sumes that its items are causal contributors to the numer-
ous negative adult outcomes, but this may not be the case.
Without detailed longitudinal studies and the measure-
ment of many additional variables, it may be very diffi-
cult to tease out whether, for example, it is household sub-
stance abuse that affects later outcomes or some
unmeasuredunderlyingparentalemotionalproblemorlack
of self-control. Moreover, a very important, but difficult
to test, alternative explanation for many of the ACE Study
findingsisthatinheritedgenesforhealthproblemsorsome
temperamental qualities create a spurious connection be-
tween abuse and neglect by parents or other family con-
text variables and mental and physical health conditions
in their offspring. If this were to be the case, it is possible,
althoughnotlikely,thatevenpreventingchildabusewould
make modest differences on health outcomes.
There are other problems with using an ACE scale even
as a long-term risk assessment tool. One is that risk as-
sessment has to factor in social changes regarding the fre-
quency, norms, and impact of different experiences. For
older respondents who answered the original ACE Study
questionnaire, parental divorce may have been an un-
usual and stigmatizing event and sexual abuse a hidden
experience that one never talked or heard anything about.
Among a younger cohort, more cultural awareness and
the increased availability of support, including profes-
sional intervention, may mean that the experience of
sexual abuse or parental divorce might have different con-
sequences. This may be why parental divorce was not a
significant predictor in the current study.
Another problem is the possibility of reverse causa-
tion in which bad later life outcomes induce reports of
more negative early childhood experiences. There is some
evidence that people recall more negative historical ad-
versity when they have poor adult outcomes, mental
health, and physical problems.45 To the degree that this
is true, variables identified in later life, such as in the ACE
Study, will not prove as predictive of ultimate health out-
comes when assessed in earlier life stages.
An additional philosophical problem worth consid-
ering in discussions about the implications of ACE-type
research is whether advocates should use a list of child-
hood features that are associated with long-term health
effects as the primary criterion of what childhood adver-
sities to prioritize for prevention. For example, if sexual
abuse were demonstrated to be minimally associated with
long-term health effects, would that disqualify it as a pri-
ority for primary prevention? No. Many childhood ad-
versities are candidates for prevention not because they
create long-term health risks but because they violate the
rights of children or cause pain and suffering at the mo-
ment. Their contributions to long-term health can be ad-
ditional evidence to consider but may not be primary.
Such adversities illustrate the tension between a utilitar-
ian and human rights perspective in child welfare policy.
CONCLUSIONS
This research suggests that the goal of identifying child-
hood adversities that are precursors to long-term health
and behavioral outcomes may be improved by consid-
ering a wider range of adversities measured in a more con-
temporaneous way. Such an approach might be well ad-
vanced by using longitudinal studies that have been
monitoring children into adulthood.12
However, more discussion is needed about the goals
and usefulness of such efforts. Although additional ef-
forts to refine an adverse childhood experience check-
list that predicts later health outcomes has scientific merit,
an argument can be made that enough is known about
certain harmful childhood experiences22 that more test-
ing of parts of this model should be carried out through
experiment rather than correlation. There is enough con-
sensus that exposure to violence, sexual abuse, and emo-
tional mistreatment are harmful and likely have long-

studies should probably focus on preventing and reme-
diating these exposures and following up to determine
whether health outcomes improve.
