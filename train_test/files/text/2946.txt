Non-technical summary
Research Question
In this methodological paper we investigate the effect of a behavioural experiment,
eliciting respondents' risk preferences, on their recording behaviour in a subsequent one
week payment diary. Both the experiment and the diary are part of a representative
survey. The experiment randomly assigns an incentive to participants. We ask whether
respondents' recording behaviour in the diary part differs depending on whether
individuals receive the incentive or not.
Contribution
We contribute to the literature on behavioural experiments in representative surveys and
the effects of incentives on data quality. Contrary to most of the existing literature, we
do not focus on participation incentives, but on incentives randomly assigned between
two stages of the interviewing process, i.e. between a regular questionnaire and self-
administered diary. We will therefore be able to assess whether incentives have an
effect on data quality given participation.
Results
Our results indicate that the outcome of the experiment has an impact on the quantity of
transactions recorded in the payments diary, but does not affect other aspects of data
quality. It also has a negligible impact on substantive measures like the cash share. This
is good news for survey practitioners and analysts alike: the experiment seems to have
some impact on consumers' commitment to the survey diary, but does not induce a bias
on the key qualitative results.

Fragestellung
In diesem methodisch ausgerichteten Papier untersuchen wir die Auswirkungen eines
Verhaltensexperiments zur Messung der Risikopräferenz auf die Qualität der
Aufzeichnungen in einem einwöchigen Zahlungstagebuch, welches die Teilnehmer im
Anschluss an das Experiment führten. Das Experiment und das Tagebuch waren
Bestandteile einer bevölkerungsrepräsentativen Studie. In dem Experiment wurden
zufällig einige Teilnehmer bestimmt, die ein finanzielles Incentive erhielten. Wir fragen
nun, ob die Qualität der Tagebuchaufzeichnungen davon abhängt, ob eine Personen das
Incentive erhielt oder nicht.
Beitrag
Dieses Papier leistet einen Beitrag zur Forschung über Verhaltensexperimente in
repräsentativen Bevölkerungsumfragen sowie zur Literatur über die Auswirkungen von
Incentives auf die Datenqualität in Surveys. Im Gegensatz zu den meisten bisher
veröffentlichten Untersuchungen soll die von uns betrachtete Anreizzahlung nicht zur
Teilnahme an der Studie motivieren, sondern wird zwischen zwei Phasen der Befragung
zufällig an die Teilnehmer verteilt. Sie erhalten das Incentive nach Beantwortung eines
regulären Fragebogens und vor der Aushändigung eines selbst auszufüllenden
Tagebuchs. Somit lässt sich beurteilen, ob der finanzielle Anreiz einen Effekt auf die
Datenqualität hat, wenn die Teilnehmer bereits zuvor für die Mitwirkung an der
Befragung gewonnen werden konnten.
Ergebnisse
Unsere Ergebnisse weisen darauf hin, dass das Experiment einen Einfluss auf die
Anzahl der aufgezeichneten Transaktionen im Zahlungstagebuch hat. Auswirkungen auf
andere Aspekte der Datenqualität finden wir jedoch nicht. Die Bedeutung des Incentives
für zentrale Resultate der Studie wie den Barzahlungsanteil ist ebenfalls zu
vernachlässigen. Dies dürfte sowohl die Produzenten als auch die Nutzer von Umfragen
freuen: Das Experiment scheint das Engagement der Konsumentinnen und
Konsumenten beim Ausfüllen des Tagesbuchs zu erhöhen, verzerrt jedoch nicht die
wesentlichen qualitativen Ergebnisse.

The Influence of an Up-Front Experiment on
Respondents' Recording Behaviour in Payment Diaries:

Abstract
In this paper, we analyse the recording behaviour of German consumers in a one week
diary on their point-of-sales expenditures. We are particularly interested in the effect of
a behavioural experiment, eliciting respondents' risk preferences, on their recording
behaviour. In the experiment, run shortly before the consumers start to fill in the diary,
the consumers have the choice between receiving a sure payment of 10 euro and
participating in a game. If they opt for playing the game they roll a die and either win 20
euro or nothing. We ask whether respondents' recording behaviour differs depending on
whether individuals who do roll the die lose or win. We argue that winners may attach a
more positive feeling to the survey than losers and therefore exhibit more commitment
to the diary, e.g. by reporting better quality data. Beyond providing evidence on the
effect of conducting up-front experiments in representative surveys our results also
contribute to the literature on incentives. For participants who roll the die, the
experiment can be seen as a tool to randomly assign an incentive to respondents. Our
results indicate that the outcome of the game has an impact on the quantity of
transactions recorded, but does not affect other aspects of data quality. It also has a
negligible impact on substantive measures like the cash share.

1 Introduction
Behavioural economists and psychologists often do experiments with convenience
samples (e.g. college students), but recently there is growing interest in embedding
behavioural experiments in representative surveys. This is one of the many promising
new directions in which survey methodology has been evolving.
The results of such experiments have been analysed at great length, but little is known
about the impact of running a behavioural experiment and its outcome on participants'
attitude towards the survey and ultimately on data quality in other parts of the study,
e.g. the classic questionnaire part. Depending on the set-up of the experiments, there is
scope for the experiment to induce biases and measurement error in the collected data.
Our paper provides evidence on this issue. We link our experiment to the literature on
the role of incentives in surveys. Our incentive experiment differs from the existing
literature in two important respects. First, we do not focus on participation incentives,
but on incentives randomly assigned to participants between two stages of the
interviewing process, i.e. between a regular questionnaire and self-administered diary
collecting data on payment transactions. We will therefore be able to assess whether
incentives have an effect on data quality given participation. Second, our participants
are aware that others have received a different incentive. Thus, they might be upset if
they receive nothing or, on the contrary, be very pleased if they win a prize. This
positive or negative attitude towards the survey ­ on top of the monetary value ­ should
result in more pronounced effects of the incentive on data quality, measured along
various dimensions. We consider different indicators of item non-response: transactions
which are not reported at all as well as incompletely reported transactions. Another
measure of data quality is the rounding of transaction amounts.
The basis for our analysis is a risk aversion experiment, which is run between a standard
questionnaire type data collection and a self-administered one week diary on
consumers' point-of-sale expenditures. In the experiment the consumers have the choice
between receiving a sure payment of 10 euro and participating in a game. If they opt for
playing the game they roll a die and either win 20 euro if it shows 4, 5, 6 or nothing if it
shows 1, 2, or 3. The consumer's choice to play or not to play is a measure of risk
aversion. For players, the risk experiment is also an incentive experiment, with a
random assignment of an extra incentive if they win and a loss of 10 euros if they lose.
On top of the monetary value, "winning" the game may induce a positive attitude
towards the survey. Both the monetary incentive itself and the positive attitude from
winning should lead to better data quality in the diary.
2
We find that the behavioural experiment seems to have some impact on consumers'
commitment to the survey diary in that they record more transactions, but it does not
induce a bias on the key qualitative results. This is good news for survey practitioners
and analysts alike.
2 Related Literature
In this section we review the literature on the effects of incentives on data quality. We
are not aware of any studies that address directly the effect of behavioural experiments
as such on data quality in subsequent data collection and thus we focus on the incentive
aspect of our experiment.
The study by Bonke and Fallesen (2010) on Danish data comes closest to what we are
doing in this paper. Bonke and Fallesen (2010) study how different incentives, paid out
through a lottery, explain people's participation rates, choice of survey mode
(CATI/CAWI) and data quality in a large scale Danish survey on time-use and
consumption. What makes the study particularly interesting for us is that they
investigate data quality in the survey diary context. However, in contrast to our study,
their participants are not aware that there are lotteries with varying prizes. They find a
strong effect of incentives on response rates as well as mode choice, but no effect per se
on data quality. Neither item non-response in the regular questionnaire of their study,
nor the number of reported activities or consumed goods and services in the diary differ
significantly with the incentives provided, if they analyse both CATI and CAWI
respondents. They do find some positive effects of incentives with respect to data
quality for CATI interviewees only. That the impact of incentives on data quality may
be rather limited has also been documented by other scholars. Davern et al. (2003) and
Shettle and Mooney (1999) investigate the impact of incentives on classic measures of
data quality like item non-response and the number of edited variables/cases. They find
that (prepaid) monetary incentives do not matter for data quality. Similarly Tzamourani
and Lynn (2000) show that there is no clear effect of incentives on data quality,
concluding that "... the incentives did not affect the respondents' answers in any way,
that is they did not induce bias in the responses." (p.16) Göritz (2005) documents for a
web-based survey that if respondents are offered an incentive that is contingent on
completing all relevant questions in the questionnaire, their reporting behaviour in terms
of number of omitted questions and other quality indicators does not differ from that of
respondents not offered the incentive. The same seems to hold for web-based studies
using access panels (Göritz, 2004).
3
Whether incentives have a positive, negative or any effect at all on respondents'
reporting behaviour is nonetheless still an open question. Studies by Lynn and Sturgis
(1997), Singer et al. (2000), Willimack et al. (1995), and James and Bolstein (1990)
found ­ contrary to the studies cited above ­ that incentives do have an effect on
reporting behaviour and data quality. Lynn and Sturgis (1997) experimented with
incentives in surveys involving diaries. They find a significant effect of incentives on
the number of events recorded in the diary. Goldenberg and Ryan (2009) report that in
the US Consumer Expenditure Diary Survey respondents receiving a pre-paid monetary
incentive of $20 or $40 reported more expenditures and also performed better on other
indicators of data quality. A similar result is reported by Goldenberg et al. (2009) for the
same type of incentives used in the Consumer Expenditure Interview Survey. Singer et
al. (2000) show that for some households, paying an incentive reduces item non-
response. However, the effect is very small: "Only 7 percent is explained by both the
demographics and the incentives, and incentives alone explain less than 1 percent of the
variance in item nonresponse." (Singer et al., 2000: 180). They also find an impact of
incentives on the distribution of responses. Respondents receiving an incentive seem to
be in a better mood (see also Schwarz and Clore, 1996) and report more optimistic
expectations. Willimack et al. (1995) summarize their findings: "In addition, evidence
suggests greater response completeness among responding incentive recipients early in
the interview, with no evidence of increased measurement error due to the incentive."
(p. 78). James and Bolstein (1990) find that what they call "large" prepaid incentives of
$ 2 lead respondents to expend more effort on completing questions in the mail survey.
They measure greater effort by the length of the respondents' answers, the number of
comments and number of words written. Interestingly they also find that large
incentives increase "... comments that were more favourable towards the survey
sponsor" (p. 346), which signals a stronger commitment to the survey. James and
Bolstein (1990) cite several older studies (e.g. Godwin, 1979, and Shuttleworth, 1931)
which have also found that respondents receiving monetary incentives have a tendency
to provide more comments and more complete responses. A similar result has been
found by Goetz et al. (1984).
3 Data and Variables
In this section we describe the Bundesbank's Payment Survey and the behavioural
experiment we ran in more detail. We also provide some information about respondent
characteristics. Furthermore, we discuss various measures of data quality in payment
diary survey which might be affected by the incentives.
4
3.1 The Bundesbank's Payment Survey
In 2014 the Bundesbank conducted the third wave of its payment behaviour survey
called "Payment Behaviour in Germany". The survey was run by the market research
institute MARPLAN on behalf of the Deutsche Bundesbank. The face-to-face
interviews with the respondents were conducted between May and July of 2014.2 In
total 2,036 persons participated in the survey. The survey is representative for the
German population aged 18 and older.
The survey consists of two main parts, a CAPI interview and a drop-off paper and
pencil diary3, which was handed out to participants after the completion of the
interview.4 While the interviews contained questions on topics like the ownership and
usage of payment instruments, cash withdrawal behaviour, perceived risks of payment
instrument usage, and respondents' demographics, the diary collected information on
actual transactions over a period of seven days and specifically refers to direct payment
transactions at the point-of-sale, i.e. all transactions apart from recurrent transactions
like rent payments, insurance fees, telephone and utility bills. The information collected
in the paper and pencil diary includes the euro amount of each transaction, the location
where the transaction took place (16 different locations including "retail purchases for
day-to-day needs", "filling stations", "restaurants", "e-commerce", "payments to private
individuals", etc.) and the payment medium used to settle it (cash and a list of eleven
cashless payment methods, e.g. debit cards, credit cards, e-payment schemes, payment
schemes via mobile phone, contactless card payments). Additionally, respondents had to
provide information on cash withdrawals in the diary. The diary contains space for up to
eight transactions for each day and some spare pages if more than eight transactions
occur on one day. At the top of each page of the diary the respondents were asked to fill
in the date and then all transactions pertaining to this date. The printed diary also
contains a page with an example of how to fill in the diary and the interviewers
2 The sample for the survey was drawn using a random-route procedure developed by the Association of
German Market and Social Researchers, the so-called "ADM" (see Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik, 2003, on random
route samples). This design implies that at a first stage small geographical areas are randomly drawn from
the population of all geographical areas in Germany using pps-sampling. In a second step a random
starting point is drawn which is linked to a specific pre-defined (walking) route the interviewer has to
follow in order to reach the households. Finally within each household one interviewee is selected using
the last birthday rule. When designing the random sample of areas (first stage), care was taken to ensure
that consumers from all 16 federal states (Länder) were included in the gross sample.
3 Respondents were also offered to fill in the diary using an application on their smartphone. Less than
two percent of respondents chose this option.
4 To spread the interviews and collected diary data across the whole survey period, the addresses/random
starting points were not given to the field at one point in time, but rolled out continuously, with new
addresses/starting points in the field each day. This procedure ensures that interviews are conducted on all
days of the week (including weekends and holidays), which implies that payment diaries were also started
on each day of the week. In practice we see that more respondents started on Wednesdays (19%)
compared to Sundays (9%).
5
explained the procedure of recording transactions to the respondents when they handed
over the diary.
Respondents received incentives both for answering the survey and for filling in the
diary. After completion of the CAPI interview the interviewer gave the respondents a
pen, a notepad and a package of shredded banknotes. A monetary incentive of 10 euro
was sent to everyone who answered the payment diary and returned it to the market
research institute. All these incentives were paid to respondents independent of the
outcome of the experiment. They do thus not confound our analysis.
A novel feature of the 2014 survey was an experiment which is supposed to elicit
respondents' risk aversion. The experiment was run after the face-to-face interview and
administered by the interviewers to all respondents.5 Respondents were free to choose
whether they wanted to participate in the experiment. Out of the 2,036 persons
completing the CAPI, 1,952 respondents (almost 96%) decided to take part in the
experiment. 6 Therefore we can rule out considerable bias in the group of participants
due to response rate bias. Consumers who took part in the experiment were given the
choice to receive 10 euro or participate in a game. If they opted for playing the game
they rolled a die and either won 20 euro if it showed 4, 5, or 6, or nothing if it showed 1,
2, or 3. The expected value of the game is 10 euro and the "assignment" of consumers
to one of the two states is obviously random if the die is fair and interviewers do
administer the experiment correctly. 982 consumers out of 1,933 participating in the
experiment took the 10 euro and 951 consumers rolled the die (see Table 1). The share
of winners is about 10 percentage points higher than expected, at almost 60%.

Safe present Roll die
982 (50.8%) 951 (49.2%)
Of which:

389 (40.9%) 562 (59.1%)
5 In contrast to many other behavioural experiments, no subgroup of respondents was selected, i.e. the
experiment is carried out using a representative sample of the population.
6 19 participants had to be excluded because they either did not return the diary or they returned a diary
without any transactions, so that we work with a sample of 1,933 consumers.
6
It cannot be ruled out that the interviewers deviated from the instructions and e.g.
allowed the respondents to role the die several times or they simply paid out the 20 euro
regardless of the number on the die. If it were the case this would mean a deviation from
an experimental setting with randomly assigned outcomes. Unfortunately it cannot be
checked ex-post why the realized and expected values do not match.7
To make sure that no bias with respect to observable socio-demographics exists
between winners and losers we run a series of t-tests (for results see Table A1 in the
Appendix). All but one come up negative, indicating that the composition of the two
groups is very similar. As expected there are significant differences in socio-
demographics between those respondents who take part in the game and those who do
not.8 Players are younger, more likely to be male and have on average a higher income.
We also run probit regressions with the decision to roll the die (yes/no) as well as the
outcome of the roll of the die (win/lose) as dependent variables, and socio-demographic
variables as explanatory variables (see Table A2 in the Appendix). They broadly
support the results of the individual t-tests. In addition, we use the CAPI interview to
check whether winners and losers differ in their self-assessed risk preferences, their
technological literacy and their approach towards new payment methods (see Tables A3
and A4 in the Appendix). We do not find any significant differences between the groups
in any of our various measures of these concepts. In contrast, participants taking the safe
present are significantly more risk-averse and prudent than those who role the die,
which supports the validity of the experiment. What is more, they are less
technologically literate (less likely to use the internet and electronic devices) and are
more conservative in their payment behaviour (less open to payment innovations, less
likely to possess a credit card or use e-payment schemes).
We have also checked for interviewer effects. In the decision to roll the die or not, these
effects exist (see Tables A1 and A2 in the Appendix). Respondents who had female
interviewers were more likely to roll the die.9 Interestingly, female respondents with
male interviewers were most likely to take the safe present and male respondents with
female interviewers were least likely to do so. We do not find significant interviewer
7 The survey agency checked with respondents after the interview whether the interviewers actually
conducted the experiment or just kept the money for themselves and whether the interviewers correctly
noted the result of rolling the die. Respondents confirmed that the experiment had been offered and that
the results had been recorded correctly. This is not a thorough check of whether consumers were allowed
to roll the die more than once, however. Unfortunately, it is not possible to identify ex-post those
interviewers who did not follow the instructions because the average number of interviews per
interviewer is only nine. Thus, the law of large numbers does not apply and a deviation of an
interviewer's share of winners or losers from the 50% mark is not necessarily a sign of misbehaviour.
8 For literature on the link between socio-demographic characteristics and risk aversion see e.g. Eckel and
Grossman, 2008; Borghans et al., 2009, Halek and Eisenhauer, 2001.

effects on winning and losing in the game, although the share of winners (both male and
female) is slightly higher when the interviewer was female.
3.2 Measures of data quality
A key decision we had to take is how to measure data quality in payment diary
surveys.10 We follow the literature cited above and look among other things at measures
related to item non-response. Item non-response can come in the form of a missing
answer for an individual transaction or a missing transaction. We use the "share of
incomplete transactions" as our measure of (classic) item non-response of the first type.
A transaction is incomplete if any of the required information regarding the transaction
is missing.
While classic item non-response is easy to detect and measure, transactions missing
completely are harder to examine. Usually no reference statistics are available which
would allow the researcher to detect underreporting of transactions. A comparison of
the total number of transactions or activities reported by consumers with incentives and
those without has thus been used as an indirect measure (e.g. Fricker and Tourangeau,
2010, Axhausen et al., 2002). We follow this literature and look at the total number of
transactions reported for each day and their structure with respect to payment methods
and transaction size.11 For cash purchases we have an additional way to assess indirectly
the "completeness" of the diary. Using the information on the initial cash balance before
the first transaction is recorded in the diary, as well as cash purchases and withdrawals
throughout the diary period we can calculate each consumer's "hypothetical" cash
balance at the end of the diary period and compare it with the figures they report
directly. If there are significant deviations this would indicate either under-reporting or
over-reporting of cash payments or withdrawals, respectively.12
Finally we assess the data quality by looking at the share of rounded values (see e.g.
Fricker and Tourangeau, 2010). The share of rounded values should be an indicator of
less commitment to the survey, as providing an exact figure can be burdensome for
consumers.
10 Issues related to unit non-response and response rate biases (see e.g. Bonke and Fallesen, 2010, p. 24)
are not considered. The reason is that only 7 out of 958 participants who rolled the die did not return the
diary or returned an empty diary. Thus, we focus on the 951 remaining respondents in our analysis.
11 Distinguishing transactions by types is comparable to Fricker and Tourangeau (2010)'s classification of
activities into different types, like basic daily activities and other activities.
12 One problem with this measure is that we cannot be certain that the initial cash balance and the final
cash balance are reported without error themselves.
8
4 Results
4.1 Number of transactions
The first indicator of data quality we look at is the number of transactions. We find that
winners record significantly more transactions on the first two days and the last day of
the diary period than respondents who did not win (see Figure 1 and Table A5 in the
Appendix). The higher number of transactions on the last day can be interpreted as an
indicator of a strong/enduring commitment to the survey instrument, if one assumes that
the willingness to record transactions declines as the diary period progresses.
Figure 1 ­ Number of transactions per person per day
Notes: *, **, *** mean difference is significant at the 90%, 95% or 99% level (one-
sided t-test).
In order to rule out that socio-demographic variables or the day of the week confound
the analysis in Figure 1, we further examine the number of transactions reported ­ both
the total number and the numbers on days 1 and 2, respectively ­ and the likelihood of
reporting any transactions on day 1 and day 2 using regression analysis. Columns (I),
(II) and (III) in Table 2 confirm that winners report more transactions in total and on the
first two diary days, even after controlling for consumers characteristics like age,
gender, income and household size as well as the day of the week (where applicable).13
The estimated coefficient for "WINNER" of 0.057 in column (I) corresponds to a
difference in the number of transactions between winners and losers of almost 0.6, as
13 The estimation results for the control variables as well as definition of the control variables are reported
in Tables A8 and A19 in the Appendix.

can be seen from Table A9 in the Appendix. For the first and second day of the diary
the difference between winners and losers also remains significant at conventional
levels. This result is mainly driven by the fact that the share of diaries without any
transactions on days one and two is significantly lower for winners than for participants
not winning the 20 euro (see columns IV and V in Table 2).14

In Figure 1 and Table A5 we look at a specific day and test whether the number of
transactions reported differs between winners and losers. Instead, one can also look at
winners and losers separately and examine whether the number of transactions reported
per day changes during the diary week for. Tables A6 and A7 in the Appendix show
that on the first survey day the number of reported transactions is significantly higher
than on the other days for both winners and losers. Winners also report significantly
more transactions on days two and three than on the following days. Losers report more
transactions on day three than in the rest of the week, while day two does not differ
greatly from days four, five, six, or seven. In sum, both winners and losers show a
strong initial commitment to the diary, but it appears to be even higher for winners than
for losers.
14 In contrast, the higher number of transactions for winners on the last day of the survey period is driven
by differences in the average number of transactions for those individuals who reported any transactions
at all.
10
One could argue that the higher number of transactions for winners is not due to the
higher commitment of winners, but can be traced back to an income effect. In that case,
winners would simply feel "richer" due to receiving 20 euro and therefore spend more
and have more transactions than they if they had not received the money. We do several
tests to investigate this income effect. If the income effect existed, it should be larger for
consumers with a low income than for those with a high income. Consequently, the
difference in transactions reported between winners and losers should be larger for
respondents in the lowest income category compared with those in higher income
classes. We test this assumption by including an interaction variable
WINNER*INCOME in our regressions on the number of transactions reported and the
share of empty diaries, which allows us to identify the effect of winning on the quantity
of transactions reported in each income category. The results can be found in Table A10
in the Appendix. Confidence intervals for the predicted outcomes (number of
transactions and share of empty diaries) can be found in Table A11. Figure 2 gives a
graphical presentation of the estimated number of transactions in the diary week for
winners and losers in different income categories. The respective confidence intervals
are also shown. As one can see, winners with low income report only slightly more
transactions than losers in the same income category. The difference is far from being
statistically significant. In the middle income category, winners report significantly
more transactions than losers (the difference is 1.2 transactions). Consequently, the
higher number of transactions reported by winners in the estimation without interaction
terms can mainly be traced back to middle income participants, not to those respondents
for whom a potential income effect is expected to be largest.
11
Figure 2 - Predictions of number of transactions for winners and losers, by income
category
If winners immediately spent the 20 euro they receive (in addition to their normal
spending), their amount spent during the diary week should be higher than the amount
spent by losers all else equal. As the 20 euro are most likely spent in cash, we look at
the amount of cash disbursed during the week.15 However, if participants simply feel
"richer", they could also spend the amount by cashless means of payment. Therefore we
also consider the total amount of spending during the diary week. As there are a few
cases of transactions with very high amounts, which should be regarded as outliers, we
do not consider t-tests of differences in means and simple OLS regression appropriate.
Instead, we use robust regression (using the Stata command rreg) and median
regression. Results are presented in Table A12 in the Appendix. All regressions show
that there is no statistically significant difference between winners and losers in total
spending and cash spending. Although the estimated coefficients for winners are
positive, they are far below 20 euro. Again, this leads us to conclude that income effects
do not drive our results on the quantity of data reported in the payment diaries.
15 Below we will also show that the cash share calculated based on the diary data is not statistically
different between winners and losers.

To sum up, we find that winners report more transactions than losers, in particular on
the first and second diary day. These differences are neither driven by socio-
demographics of the respondents, nor by income effects. Whether the high engagement
on the first diary days leads to more accurate reporting or gives room to survey
exuberance, i.e. respondents report transactions that did not actually take place on that
day, is an open issue. Based on the evidence we present here it e.g. cannot be ruled out
that consumers either report older payments on day one or change their behaviour and
deliberately buy something so they do not have to leave the first days' page of the diary
empty.
To shed some light on this latter issue we analyse the structure of payments for each day
for the two groups of consumers. If the structure differed significantly this would be an
indication of the winners reporting specific or special payments on days one and two.
4.2 Type and size of transactions
To investigate whether winners report specific or special payments on days one and
two, we first look at cash transactions as a specific type of transaction. Figure A1 in the
Appendix shows that while no clear decreasing pattern exist with respect to the overall
number of cash transactions recorded by the consumers participating in the experiment,
days one and two exhibit the highest average number of cash transactions for winners.
However, day one also sticks out for losers. Cash transactions thus follow a similar
pattern as the total number of transactions described in Section 4.1. Consequently, the
higher number of cash transactions could simply be a "sample size" effect and not
induce a bias in the analysis of payment behaviour, which is mainly concerned with the
share of cash transactions. A higher absolute number of cash transactions for winners
would induce a bias only if it were disproportionally higher than in a situation in which
they had lost. Put differently, if participants who win report more cash and more non-
cash payments, no distortions should occur. In order to identify possible distortions, we
compare the cash shares of the two groups of consumers across days.
Figure 3 and Table A13 in the Appendix show that the difference with respect to the
cash share between those who win and those who lose is insignificant on each of the
seven diary days as well as for the whole diary week. Moreover, it is sometimes positive
and sometimes negative, and alternates for the first two days.16
16 A similar picture emerges if we calculate the share of cash transactions for each day by first grossing up
all cash transactions and dividing this number by the total number of transactions on the respective day,
compared to first calculating the share of cash transactions for each individual and then taking the
average, as we did in Figure 3. The additional results are available upon request.
13
Figure 3 ­ Share of cash transactions per person per day
Notes: Calculated for individuals with more than zero transactions on given day.
*, **, *** mean difference significant at the 90%, 95% or 99% level (two-sided t-test).
We also see that the cash share shows a high fluctuation between days for winning
consumers, while the consumers who lose exhibit the "typical" pattern, i.e. the cash
share is highest on day one (see Schmidt, 2014). We do not find significant differences
in the reported cash shares between day one and all other days of the diary week ­
neither for winners nor for losers. Taking this together there is no evidence for a
disproportional reporting of cash payments on days one and two for winners.
Another classic categorisation of transactions is by their size (see e.g. Bagnall, 2015).
There is evidence that small value transactions are underreported in diary surveys. A
high and stable number of small value transactions can therefore be interpreted as a sign
of good quality.17 A higher number of small value transactions below 5 euro and in
particular also a higher share among all transactions for winners would suggest that
these consumers do exhibit a stronger commitment to the survey. In our study, the
difference in the share of small value transactions between winners and losers is not
significant (see also Figure 4 and Table A14 in the Appendix). Interestingly, the share
of small value transactions below 5 euro is higher for consumers losing in the
experiment on day one, but lower overall. This could indicate that winners record
relatively more small value transactions as the diary progresses than losers. However,
17 Small value transactions (below 5 euros) are in essence a subgroup of cash transactions, because almost
all those transactions are conducted in cash (see Bagnall, 2015, and Deutsche Bundesbank, 2015).

the differences between winners and losers are insignificant overall and on all individual
days.

Notes: Calculated for individuals with more than zero transactions on given day.
*, **, *** mean difference significant at the 90%, 95% or 99% level (two-sided t-test).
A third related way to describe the structure of transactions is by the average amount
spent per transaction (see Table A15 in the Appendix). One can see that the average
transaction size is slightly higher on the first three days and the last day of the diary
period than on days four to six. However, none of the differences between days is
significant ­ neither for winners, nor for losers, nor for both groups combined. In
addition, the differences in average transaction size between winners and losers are
insignificant for each diary day and for all days taken together. This is evidence that the
higher number of transactions reported on the first days of the diary do not induce a bias
on the results. In other words, should participants report transactions from before the
diary period on the first diary day, those transactions do have a similar structure as the
"real" transactions. In addition, one does not find a significant under-reporting of small
value transactions as the diary period progresses.
4.3 Final cash balance
Ideally we would be able to compare the recorded pattern of payments with the actual
payment pattern and calculate the measurement error directly. This is of course not

possible. We can make use of a specific feature of the diary, however. The diary asks
respondents to open their wallet and count the amount of cash in their wallet before they
make the first transaction in the diary period. They then record all their (cash) purchases
and cash withdrawals for the diary period and are again asked to count the money in
their wallet at the end of the diary period. Using the information on the initial cash
balance and cash purchases and withdrawals we can calculate each consumer's "cash
flow" and in particular their "hypothetical" cash balance at the end of the diary period.
The latter can then be compared to the balance they reported after counting the money
in their wallet. We assume the final cash balance reported to be of good enough quality
to be used as a benchmark and interpret deviations between the two measures to be
related to an over- or underreporting of cash withdrawals and cash purchases rather than
measurement error on the cash balance reported at the beginning of the diary.18 We
calculate both the difference between the hypothetical cash balance and the actual as
well as the absolute value of the difference. Table 3 shows some descriptive statistics
and Figure 5 shows the distribution for winners and losers.

absolute value of the difference in cash balances, in euro

P90 34.38 64.00 65.43 89.86
We first test whether the differences in the cash balances of winners and losers come
from the same distribution. A simple t-test reveals that there are no significant
differences between the mean difference in cash balances between winners and losers.
Furthermore, we cannot reject that the two samples have the same median and variance.
The hypothesis that the two samples come from the same distribution cannot be rejected
when the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test is performed. All tests performed show the

respondents do not report the payment instrument they used or the amount they paid, the transaction is
disregarded in the calculation of the hypothetical cash balance.

same qualitative results both for the difference in cash balances and its absolute value.
In sum, there appear to be no differences between winners and losers with respect to this
indicator of data quality.

reported cash balances at the end of the diary period, in euro cents
4.4 Incomplete transaction data
In the previous sections we have looked at item non-response with respect to completely
missing transactions. In this section we focus on the classic item non-response
measures, i.e. missing information on recorded transactions. In the payment diary
respondents were asked to answer several questions concerning each single transaction.
Besides the amount, the payment instrument used and the location where the transaction
took place, respondents were also asked about various circumstances that might have
influenced their payment choice. Up to eight variables pertain to one transaction. Giving
all the requested information requires reading the diary carefully and remembering the
transaction precisely. This can be burdensome for respondents.

Figure 6 - Share of incomplete transactions per person per day
Notes: *, **, *** mean difference is significant at the 90%, 95%, or 99% level (two-
sided t-test).
Figure 6 and Table A16 in the Appendix show that the share of incomplete transactions
is around 35% on average. There are slightly fewer incomplete transactions for winners
than for losers. The shares of incomplete transactions do not differ significantly overall
or for any of the individual days of the diary.
Figure 6 also shows that both winners and losers report more incomplete transactions as
the diary week progresses. Pairwise t-tests on the shares of incomplete transactions on
the first and second day compared to all other days of the diary show significant
differences (results not reported).
4.5 Rounding
Reporting precise amounts in the diary can be a burden for consumers. They have to
remember the exact amount or keep the receipt, for example. Thus, many people round
the reported transaction values in the payment diaries. In the 2014 Bundesbank payment
diary, we see that on average about one quarter (28%) of all transactions per person per
day are rounded.19 Figure 7 and Table 17 in the Appendix show that this rate is only
marginally higher for consumers who win the 20 euro. Consumers winning and those
losing in the experiment both show increasing rates of rounded values as the diary
progresses, under-scoring the value of this measure as a quality indicator.20 Overall the
19 Rounding is defined here as rounding to full euro amounts.
20 T-tests of the differences between day one and the other days produce significant results for some of
the days. However, one has to keep in mind that only the shares of rounded values of those respondents
who report transactions on both days of the comparison can be included in the calculations.

difference between the two groups with respect to rounded values is not significant,
with the exception of day 5.

4.6 Robustness Checks
As Table A1 shows, there are no significant differences in socio-demographics between
winners and losers in the experiment. We therefore assumed throughout this paper that
differences between winners and losers in the quality indicators are not driven by socio-
demographic factors, but by the random outcome of the role of the die. In order to make
this assumption more robust, we run a series of regressions with our quality indicators
as dependent variable, the outcome of the role of the die (winner or loser) as
independent variable and various socio-demographics as control variables. We find that
being a winner does not have a significant effect on any of the quality measures (see
Table 4 and Table 18 in the Appendix). This indicates that the higher quantity of
transactions reported on the first days does not affect qualitative aspects of the results,
such as the share of cash transactions, the share of small transactions, the average
transaction amount, the share of transactions with incomplete transaction information
and the share of rounded transactions.

5 Conclusions
In this paper we analyse the effect of an experiment performed as part of a
representative national survey on participants' recording behaviour in a subsequent one-
week payment diary. In the experiment participants rolled a die and had the chance to
win 20 euro depending on the number on the die. We interpret this as a random
assignment of a monetary incentive, where in contrast to most other incentive
experiments the person receiving the incentive (winners) knows that they received a
higher incentive than some of the other participants. The experiment itself could thus
stimulate positive feelings in winners and negative feelings in losers towards the survey
and the diary in general. Consequently, we expect winners to report higher quality data
in the diary than losers. On the downside, winning the money could lead to survey
exuberance, i.e. inducing respondents to report transactions that did not actually take
place or took place before the diary started.
We measure data quality with several indicators: the number of transactions recorded,
the share of cash transactions, the share of low value transactions (below 5 euro), the
share of rounded transactions values, the share of transactions with incomplete
information and the concordance of hypothetical and actual cash balances at the end of
the diary week. We find that the experiment seems to have some impact on consumers'
commitment to the survey diary. The impact on data quality and on the key qualitative
results is rather limited, however. Results show that winners report significantly more
transactions than losers, in particular on the first, second and last day of the diary. More
20
specifically, there are fewer diaries without any transactions on the first or the second
day for winners. We can rule out that the larger number of transactions recorded on the
first days is due to an income effect induced by winning 20 euro. Neither of the other
quality measures differs significantly between winners and losers. Furthermore the low
variation between the two groups of the cash share and the share of small value
transactions indicate that important findings from the diary, such as the overall cash
share of point-of-sale transactions and the share of transactions within certain value
ranges, are not biased by the outcome of the experiment.
We find evidence that some indicators of data quality deteriorate as the diary week
progresses. On the first and second day, respondents round less and report more
complete transactions.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to look into the effects of behavioural or
psychological experiments with monetary rewards carried out during a representative
national survey. Including experiments in such surveys is a rather new and promising
approach, considering that previously behavioural experiments were often carried out
with a non-representative part of the population (e.g. students). However, up to now
little is known on how such experiments influence participants' attitude towards the
survey to which the experiment is linked. Our research indicates that including an
experiment does not affect the survey's data quality negatively.
We were mainly concerned with the incentive effects of the experiment, both monetary
and non-monetary. Whether other features of the experiment also play a role for
respondents' reporting behaviour is still an open issue. It is feasible to assume that the
design and administration of the experiment by the interviewers could potentially
confound and even counteract the incentive effects. More research on these issues is
necessary.
