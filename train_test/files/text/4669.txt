Introduction
Angiotensin II (Ang II), the main effector of the renin-
angiotensin system, is directly and indirectly involved in
the development of cardiac hypertrophy, which increases
the risk of sudden death and heart failure.1­4 It acts locally
within cardiac tissues to influence protein synthesis and
cellular growth via activation of the Ang II type 1 (AT1-)
receptor independently of its effects on blood pressure,
which increase cardiac work.5­8 Ang II induces foetal, neo-
natal and adult cardiomyocyte hypertrophy;5,6,9­18 and fol-
lowing the development of cardiac hypertrophy both the
AT1- and Ang II type 2 (AT2-) receptor levels are up-regu-
lated.19­21 By contrast, activation of the AT2-receptor has
been shown to inhibit the proliferation of vascular smooth
muscle cells, endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes and fibro-
blasts.22­29 In AT2-receptor-deficient mice the induction of
myocardial infarction resulted in a greater hypertrophic
response than in wild-type controls.30,31
However, the role of the AT2-receptor in the heart is not
so clear cut, and other studies indicate that theAT2-receptor
may have a proliferative or hypertrophic role in the heart.
For instance, mice that over-express the AT2-receptor have
an increased myocyte cross-sectional area and fibrosis.32
Moreover, in contrast to the studies described above sug-
gesting that the AT2-receptor maybe cardio-protective, Ang
II infusion, aortic banding and myocardial infarction did
not induce cardiac hypertrophy in AT2-receptor-deficient
mice.33­35
Clearly, the exact nature of the cardiac AT2-receptor
and its signalling pathways remain elusive. Recently we

Abstract
Hypothesis: Cardiac hypertrophy in myocytes is in part regulated by changes in expression of a novel Ang II type 2
receptor (AT2-receptor) interacting protein identified as ATIP.
Introduction: The role of the AT2-receptor in cardiac hypertrophy is controversial, with some reports indicating
that AT2-receptor activation has detrimental effects on disease progression, whereas others indicate that it has a
beneficial role.
Materials and methods: In an effort to unravel this paradox, we examined the expression and function of ATIP in
cell-based models of cardiac hypertrophy using QPCR, immunohistochemistry, cell proliferation, morphological and
transfection techniques in H9c2 cardio-myoblast and myotubules.
Results: These studies indicate that in cultured cardio-myoblast and myotubules, Ang II mediates cellular hypertrophy
and proliferation solely via the AT1-receptor, the ATIP variants are abundantly expressed and that ATIP3 may play an
anti-proliferative/hypertrophic role in these cells in the absence of AT2-receptor expression or activation.
Conclusions: Previously ATIP has been shown to inhibit growth factor signalling in cancerous cells via an interaction with
the AT2-receptor. This is the first report to identify that ATIP may have a similar role in other disease states characterised
by excessive growth and indicates that for ATIP3, at least, an interaction with the AT2-receptor may not be necessary.

identified expression of a novel intracellular protein, des-
ignated ATIP, which has been shown to interact with the
C-terminus of the AT2-receptor but not with the AT1-, 2-
adrenergic or bradykinin BK receptors.36,37 Five ATIP iso-
forms designated ATIP1, ATIP2, ATIP3a, ATIP3b and
ATIP4,38 have been identified in humans, whereas only
ATIP1, ATIP3, which corresponds to human ATIP3b, and
ATIP4 have been identified in the rat.39 In a range of nor-
mal and cancer cell lines, it has been demonstrated that
ATIP1, working in concert with the AT2-receptor, inhibits
growth factor-induced and Ang II-induced cell prolifera-
tion via inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK).37,38,40,41
Beyond this, little definite is known regarding the intra-
cellular-signalling pathways via which the ATIP isoforms
act; for instance, initial reports indicated that ATIP1 did not
act as a phosphatase nor did it interact directly with protein
tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1),36,37 a soluble protein tyros-
ine phosphatase that inhibits growth factor receptor signal-
ling and is activated following stimulation of the
AT2-receptor.42 More recently, however, AT2-receptor acti-
vation in primary cultures of rat neural cells resulted in for-
mation of an ATIP/SHP-1 complex which translocates to
the nucleus resulting in increased expression of one of the
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variants, MMS2, which in
turn prevents neural damage and promotes neural cell dif-
ferentiation.36,37,41,43 Moreover, in human breast cancer cell
lines, ATIP3 expression has been shown to alter the pro-
gression of cell division by promoting prolonged meta-
phase, thereby leading to a reduced number of cells
undergoing active mitosis;44 however, the importance of
the interaction between the AT2-receptor and ATIP3 in
breast cancer cells is unknown. Even less is known regard-
ing the function and the intracellular signalling pathways of
the ATIP isoforms in cardiac tissues and cell lines.
Therefore, in the present study we have examined the
expression and function of the three rat ATIP variants in
H9c2 cardiomyoblasts and myotubules in an attempt to
gain new insights into the nature of the cardiac ATIP iso-
forms and their interaction with the AT2-receptor.
Methods
Cell culture
Rat H9c2 myoblasts were grown in Dulbecco's Modified
Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4 mM glu-
tamine, 1.5 g/l sodium bicarbonate solution 7.5% and 10%
foetal calf serum (FCS). Rat myotubule cells were con-
verted from H9c2 cells by allowing them to become conflu-
ent prior to changing the media to DMEM media
supplemented with 4 mM glutamine, 1.5 g/l sodium bicar-
bonate solution 7.5% and 2% horse serum for 12 days to
allow cell differentiation. All cell lines were maintained at
37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2
and 95% air.
Over-expression studies in rat H9c2 cell line
Over-expression studies utilised the full-length human
ATIP1 and ATIP3 fragment, sub-cloned into a pcDNA3
vector which had been kindly donated by Dr Clara Nahmias
(Institute Cochin, Paris, France). The day prior to transfec-
tion, cells were plated in six well plates at a density of
1.5 × 105 cells/well in DMEM media. Extra wells were
seeded to examine the level of ATIP1 and ATIP3 mRNA
over-expression in the cells using real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). Cells were approximately 60% con-
fluent prior to transfection. On the day of transfection, 3 l
of a pcDNA3 vector containing human ATIP1, ATIP3 or
pcDNA3 vector only (negative control) were diluted in 100
l/well of serum-free DMEM in sterile tubes. In a separate
tube, 4 l/well of Lipofectin® transfection reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was diluted in 100 l/well
of serum-free DMEM. Both tubes were incubated for 40
minutes (min) at room temperature, following which the
two tubes were mixed together and incubated for another
12 min at room temperature to allow for the formation of
transfection complexes. A 1 ml aliquot of the solution was
then added to each well and gently mixed to ensure uniform
distribution. The plates were then incubated at 37°C humid-
ified atmosphere of 5% CO2
and 95% air for 24 hours.
Following this incubation, the media were changed to
serum-free DMEM and the cells were starved for 24 hours.
Real-time PCR
Rat myoblast and myotubule cells were seeded in 25 cm2
plastic flasks or six well plates containing complete DMEM
serum (CS), 2% horse serum DMEM serum (HS) or other
treatments made in serum-free DMEM (SF). RNA was
extracted using the RNeasy® Mini Kit (QIAGEN, USA).
The quality and concentration of mRNA, as well as DNAse
treatment, were performed as previously described.45 The
oligonucleotides primers and TaqmanTM probes for the
various genes (Table 1) were kindly designed by Ms Josefa
Pete (Baker Heart Research Institute, Prahran, Victoria,
Australia) using Primer Express v2.0 (Applied Biosystems,
CA, USA). Probes for the target genes were labelled with
6-carboxy-fluoresecein (FAM) reporter dye at the 5' end.
cDNA samples for each sample were analysed using the
Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-time PCR System
(Branchburg, New Jersey, USA). PCR amplification was
conducted as previously described.45 To control for varia-
tions in the amount of DNA used, the expression of the can-
didate gene of interest was normalised simultaneously (by
multiplexing) in relation to expression of the housekeeping
gene 18S RNA (rRNA) (18S rRNA TaqMan Control
Reagent, Applied Biosystems). The CT
value of each candi-
date gene probe was subtracted from the CT
value of 18S
ribosomal mRNA to give a CT
value. The values are rep-
resented as CT
or percentage fold change.

Immunoblotting for ATIP protein
Immunoblotting for ATIP protein was undertaken as previ-
ously described.46 In short, cells were grown in T-125 flasks
to 80% confluency and then detached, centrifuged and lysed
in extraction buffer for five min on ice. Lysates were centri-
fuged and the pellet was discarded. Protein concentration was
determined using Bradford instant protein assay.47 Following
protein determination, a 0.5 volume of 2× Laemmli's buffer
was added to each sample. Lysates were heated at 95°C for
five mins and separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immu-
noblotting onto nitrocellulose. Blots were incubated with
1:1000 anti-ATIP antibody (kindly donated by Dr Clara
Nahmias, Cochin Institute, Paris, France)46 overnight at 4ºC
and bands visualised with an enhanced chemiluminescence
kit (ECL Western blotting analysis system, Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech UK Ltd, UK). Blots were stripped and re-
hybridised with anti--actin antibody (A5316, Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA) as a control for protein added. Band inten-
sities were measured as previously described.45 Each sample
was run in duplicate and the ratio of ATIP over -actin was
generated for four separate experiments.
Immunoblotting of extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 2 (ERK2) phosphorylation
ERK2 phosphorylation assays were conducted as described
previously.45 In summary, cells were grown in six well plates
at a density of 150,000 cells per well overnight in 37°C/5%
CO2
. The following day the cells were FCS-starved for 48
hours prior to stimulation with the following treatments for
15 min: epidermal growth factor (EGF) (16 nM, E9644,
Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), Ang II (500 nM, A9525,
Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) or CGP42112A (500 nM,
C160, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were then washed
with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed in ice-
cold buffer and Western blots performed as previously
described.45 Blots were hybridised overnight at 4°C with
1:1000 anti-phosphorylated ERK1/2 primary antibody
(Sigma Aldrich Co., Australia). The following day the mem-
brane was washed for one hour with skim milk and incubated
with 1:1000 anti-phospho ERK1/2 antibody (R&D Systems)
for one hour at room temperature prior to visualisation of
protein bands as described above.Anti-MAP kinase 2 (ERK-
2) antibody (1:1000 dilution) was used as a control for pro-
tein. The values presented in the results are the average
phosphorylation of ERK2 relative to the amount of unphos-
phorylated ERK2 in six separate samples. Band intensity
levels were measured using the Multi Gauge program. In
order to simultaneously determine ERK2 phosphorylation
andATIPover-expression in the studies that examined ERK2
phosphorylation in myoblasts over-expressing ATIP1 or
ATIP3, six additional wells were plated at the commence-
ment of the assay (three of the wells were transfected with
the negative control and the remaining wells were transfected
with the relevantATIP variant) and mRNAwas generated for
quantitative (Q)PCR analysis directly following the end of
the ERK2 phosphorylation assay.
Immunohistochemistry
Rat myoblasts and myotubules were seeded on sterilised
cover-slips in six well plates at 150,000 cells per well. Cells
were incubated for different periods (24, 48, 96 hours or 12
days) at 37ºC/5% CO2
incubator and then fixed by immer-
sion in ice-cold 100% methanol for 10 min, followed by
five min in PBS containing 0.1% triton X. Cover-slips were
washed for five min in PBS and incubated with blocking
solution (10% HS, 0.3% triton-X, 3% bovine serum albu-
min (BSA) made up in PBS) for one hour. The cover-slips
were then washed with PBS for five min and incubated
overnight at 4ºC in ATIP primary antibody, with or without
a 1:3 dilution of ATIP antigen.
The following day, the cover-slips were incubated for one
hour at room temperature with EnVision+® System-labelled
polymer-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) anti-rabbit (DAKO,
Australia) and incubated with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole
(AEC) Chromogen for 10 min. The slides were then counter-
stained with haematoxylin and Scott's tap water.

Morphological visualisation of rat myoblast
and myotubule cells
Morphological changes in rat myoblasts and myotubules
were detected by seeding the cells at 150,000 cells per
well in six well plates on sterile cover-slips. The cells
were treated as described in the legend to Figure 1. On
the final day of the experiment, cells were methanol
fixed and then immersed in 0.1% Triton X in PBS for
four min at room temperature. Cover-slips were then
incubated for two min at room temperature with haema-
toxylin and then for three to four seconds with 0.3% acid
alcohol to remove background staining. The cover-slips
were finally stained with eosin for two min at room tem-
perature and then rehydrated in 90% and 100% alcohol
and washed for 30 seconds in xylene. Cover-slips were
mounted on slides and cell size was determined using the
MCID program (InterFocus Imaging Ltd, UK). The outer
layer of the cell was traced and the area was calculated
for 10 cells in each field and five fields were chosen for
each treatment.
[3H]Thymidine incorporation assay
These studies were conducted as previously described.45 In
short, H9c2 myoblasts were seeded in 24 well plates at
35,000 cells per well and incubated in the presence or
absence of 16 nM EGF, 100 nM Ang II and 500 nM
CGP42112A for 18 hours. [3H]thymidine (1.0 Ci/ml) (GE
Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, England) was added to each
well and cells were incubated for a further two hours at
37°C and 5% CO2
. Cells were then washed twice with ice-
cold PBS to remove unincorporated [3H]thymidine prior to
the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid solution (TCA,
AJAX Chemicals, N.S.W, Australia, 250 l) to each well,
which were then left on ice for 30 minutes at 4ºC to allow
protein precipitation. Cells were washed with 70% ethanol
and NaOH/SDS (0.25 M NaOH (APS Finechem, N.S.W,
Australia)/0.1% SDS, 300 l) solution was added to each
well to lyse the cells. Three hundred l of suspension was
then transferred to a counter plate and 300 l of `Optiphase
supermix' solution (Wallac, Turku, Finland) was added.
Radioactivity present was then determined using a 1450
Microbeta PLUS liquid scintillation counter (Wallac,
Turku, Finland).
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Statistical differ-
ences between the mean values for real-time PCR, Western
blot, immunohistochemical and hypertrophy studies were
examined either using Student's t test or analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) with Tukey-Kramer Multiple Comparisons
Post tests (comparing all pairs of columns or by using
Graphpad Instat ® v3.06 (Graphpad Software Inc, La Jolla,
CA, USA)). P values of < 0.05 were considered significant.
In some instances, where noted, data were log-transformed
and the data graphed represent the back-transformed geo-
metric mean and 95% confidence intervals.

respectively.

ATIP4 and the individual levels of ATIP1, ATIP3, AT1- and
AT2-receptors, were examined in rat myoblasts and
myotubules.
tATIP mRNA was expressed at high levels in both cell
lines, with ATIP3 mRNA being the major ATIP isoform
present (Table 2). ATIP1 mRNA was expressed at signifi-
cantly higher levels (two-fold, p = 0.03) in myoblast than
in myotubule cells, whereas tATIP and ATIP3 were
expressed at similar levels in both cell lines. By contrast,
AT1-receptor mRNA was approximately three-fold higher
in myotubules than myoblasts (p = 0.01); whereas,
although relatively low levels of AT2-receptor mRNA
were identified in myotubule cells, it could not be consist-
ently detected in myoblasts (i.e. it was identified in only
six of the 40 independent samples examined), strongly
suggesting that AT2-receptor mRNA is expressed at
higher levels in myotubules than myoblasts and that
there is little to no AT2-receptor mRNA expressed in
myoblast cells.
tATIP protein expression and localisation in
myoblast and myotubule cell lines
Using an anti-ATIP antibody that identifies all three ATIP
isoforms present in the rat (i.e. tATIP),36 tATIP protein
expression and localisation was examined in whole myo-
blast and myotubule cells grown on cover-slips. tATIP
staining was localised to the cytoplasm of both cell lines,
whereas there was little or no staining observed in the
nuclei (Figure 2). Moreover, staining was inhibited when
cells were incubated with an ATIP antibody that had been
pre-absorbed overnight with ATIP antigen (Figure 2(b), (d),
(f) and (g)).
To quantitate ATIP levels, some cover-slips were not
counterstained with haematoxylin and Scott's tap water
(Figure 2(a), (b), (e) and (f)) and four randomly chosen
fields from each cover-slip were then examined (Figure
2(a) and (e)) for tATIP staining intensity, determined using
the MCID program. The analysis indicated that tATIP stain-
ing was significantly (p < 0.01) higher in myoblasts than
myotubule cells (Figure 2(i)).
Effect of treatment with Ang II, EGF and
CGP42112A on the mRNA expression of
Ang II receptors and ATIP in myoblast and
myotubule cells
In both rat myoblast and myotubule cells, treatment with
either 16 nM EGF, 100 nM Ang II or the specific AT2-
receptor agonist CGP42112A (500 nM) did not modify the
expression mRNA for either Ang II receptor or any ATIP
variant (data not shown).
Effect of treatment with Ang II, EGF and
CGP42112A on myoblast and myotubule
morphology and hypertrophy
Rat myoblast and myotubule cells were seeded on cover-
slips, treated for 48 or 96 hours with EGF or 96 hours with
Ang II, or CGP42112A and cell volume was calculated fol-
lowing counterstaining.
As the size of cell nucleus was not significantly different
in the untreated and treated cells (p = 0.23 for myoblasts
and p = 0.39 for myotubules), we used mean change in cell
volume as a measure of cellular hypertrophy.
Treatment of myoblasts with 16 nM EGF for 48 hours
had no effect on cell volume, whereas 96-hour EGF treat-
ment significantly induced (p < 0.001) cellular hypertro-
phy. Stimulation with eitherAng II (100 nM) or CGP42112A
(500 nM) for 96 hours also significantly increased cell vol-
ume (i.e. cellular hypertrophy) (p < 0.001).
In myotubules, 48 hours' treatment with 16 nM EGF or
96 hours treatment with Ang II or CGP42112A induced a
significant increase in myotubule volume (p  0.001).
When Ang II was added in combination with the AT1-
receptor blocker losartan (500 nM) it no longer induced cell
hypertrophy, suggesting that Ang II-induced hypertrophy is
primarily mediated through activation of the AT1-receptor
in myotubule cells (data not shown).
We then examined the effects of the AT2-selective ago-
nist CGP42112A (500 nM) in the presence and absence of
AT1-receptor blockade (500 nM losartan). As in our previ-
ous studies in myoblasts, CGP42112A significantly

increased cell volume (p < 0.01), whereas losartan by itself
had no effect on cell volume (Figure 1(a)). However, when
losartan was given in combination with CGP42112A it
reversed the effects of the agonist, and cell volume was not
significantly different from control cells (Figure 1(a)). The
results in myotubule cells were similar, with CGP42112A
significantly increasing cell volume compared to control
cells (p < 0.01) and losartan reversing the effects of
CGP42112A (Figure 1(b)).
Effect of Ang II, EGF and CGP42112A myoblast
and myotubule proliferation
As H9c2 myotubule cells are terminally differentiated and
do not undergo mitosis, H9c2 myoblasts were treated with
a range of EGF (1 pM­10 nM), Ang II (10 nM­1 µM) and
CGP42112A (500 nM) concentrations to determine the
effect of the agonists on the rate of cell proliferation, as
measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation.
Following 18 hours' treatment there was a significant
dose-dependent increase in the rate of cell proliferation fol-
lowing treatment with 1 nM and 10 nM EGF (Figure 3(a)); by
contrast, Ang II increased proliferation significantly only at
concentrations of greater or equal to 100 nM (Figure 3(b)).
When cells were treated with 10 nM EGF in combination
with 100 nM Ang II, [3H]thymidine incorporation was
increased above the levels seen when myoblasts with treated
with 10 nM EGF alone (Figure 3(c)). By contrast, the increase
in proliferation seen when the cells were treated with 500 nM
CGP42112A (AT2-receptor agonist) for 18 hours did not
reach significance, and incubation of CGP42112A in combi-
nation with EGF did not potentiate the effects of EGF above
those seen for EGF alone (Figure 3(c)). A final series of stud-
ies identified that 1 µM losartan reversed the significant pro-
liferative effects of 1 µM Ang II (Figure 3(d)).
Effect of Ang II, EGF and CGP42112A
on ERK phosphorylation in myoblast and
myotubule cells
ERK2 phosphorylation was examined in myoblast and
myotubule cells to identify whether the proliferative and
hypertrophic effects of Ang II, EGF and CGP42112A seen
in our preceding studies were mediated through the ERK2
pathway.
In rat myoblast cells 16 nM EGF induced ~110%
increase in ERK2 phosphorylation compared to untreated
cells (p < 0.01) (Figure 4(a)). By contrast, 500 nM Ang II
did not significantly increase ERK2 phosphorylation (p >
0.05). However, when EGF was added in combination with
Ang II, ERK2 phosphorylation was increased by approxi-
mately 170%, which was 60% higher than when EGF was
given alone (p < 0.001) (Figure 4(a)). CGP42112A (500
nM) did not affect ERK2 phosphorylation (p > 0.05)
(Figure 4(b)) and, unlike the effect of Ang II in these cells,
CGP42112A did not potentiate the effects of EGF.
In rat myotubule cells 16 nM EGF induced an approxi-
mate 125% increase in ERK2 phosphorylation (p < 0.001)
(Figure 4(c)). By contrast, 500 nM Ang II alone did not

affect ERK2 phosphorylation; however, in combination
with EGF, it potentiated the ability of EGF to induce ERK2
phosphorylation (255%), approximately 130% higher than
EGF treatment alone (p < 0.001) (Figure 4(c)). Although
the increase in ERK2 phosphorylation response was of a
greater magnitude following the treatment of myotubules

with the combination of EGF and Ang II, a similar synergy
of effect was also observed in myoblast cells (Figure 4(a)).
As in myoblasts, 500 nM CGP42112A had no effect on
ERK2 phosphorylation in myotubules nor did it potentiate
the effects of 16 nM EGF when given in combination
(Figure 4(d)). In all ERK studies we observed that the basal
levels of ERK2 phosphorylation were significantly higher
(approximately 50%) in rat myoblast than myotubule cells
(p < 0.05) (Figure 4(e)).
Effect of ATIP1 and ATIP3 over-expression
on ERK phosphorylation in myoblasts
Preliminary studies identified 48 hours as the optimum
time point for over-expression studies (data not shown). In
H9c2 myoblasts transfected with an empty pcDNA3 vec-
tor (control transfected) stimulation with 16 nM EGF
induced an approximate 3.5-fold increase in ERK2 phos-
phorylation (p < 0.005) (Figure 5(a) and (b)). In myoblasts
transfected with ATIP1 there was no difference in the basal
levels of ERK2 phosphorylation or the ability of EGF to
stimulate pERK2 compared with empty pcDNA3 trans-
fected myoblasts.
By contrast, although the basal levels of ERK2 phospho-
rylation were similar in both ATIP3 transfected and control
transfected myoblasts (Figures 5(c) and (d)), the ability of
16 nM EGF to induce phosphorylation of ERK2 was
significantly attenuated in myoblasts transfected with
ATIP3 compared with the effects of EGF in control trans-
fected cells (p < 0.05).
Discussion
The clonal cell line H9c2, which was derived from embry-
onic rat heart, exhibits many of the properties of skeletal
muscle and is often used as a surrogate for cardiac or skel-
etal muscle in vitro.48 When cultured in low-serum medium,
H9c2 myoblasts terminally differentiate into myocytes/
myotubules.49 In the present studies we have examined
AT1-, AT2-receptor mRNA and ATIP mRNA and protein
expression in rat H9c2 cardiac myoblast and myotubule
cells under treated and untreated conditions. Moreover, we
have described the effect of growth agents on cellular
hypertrophy in these cells, as well as identifying the effects
of ATIP1 and ATIP3 over-expression on ERK2 phospho-
rylation in myoblasts.
This is the first time ATIP expression has been investi-
gated in cardiac cell lines, and we identified that ATIP
mRNA was abundantly expressed in both myoblast and
myotubules, withATIP3 being the predominantly expressed
variant (Table 2). Moreover, the expression ofAT1-receptor
mRNA was confirmed in both cell lines, and we identified
that rat myotubules demonstrated higher levels of mRNA
forbothAT1-andAT2-receptorsthanmyoblasts.Previously,

it has been reported that H9c2 cells do not express AT2-
receptors,50 and our own results give support to this finding
as we detected AT2-receptor mRNA in myoblast cells only
at very low levels and not consistently in all samples. These
findings are in contrast to the relative expression of the
ATIP variants in rat left ventricle, where ATIP1 mRNA was
the predominantly expressed ATIP variant followed by
ATIP3 mRNA.39 ATIP protein was identified in both whole
myoblasts and myotubules using immunohistochemical
techniques (Figure 2(a) and (b)); cytoplasmic staining for
tATIP in whole cells was significantly higher in myoblasts
than myotubules (Figure 1(i)). Unfortunately, due to the
non-specific nature of the anti-tATIP antibody used in the
immunohistochemical studies, it was not possible to deter-
mine the relative expression of the individual ATIP proteins
in whole cells. Therefore, no real conclusions could be
drawn regarding the efficiency of translation of the various
ATIP mRNA species in the cells; however, it is tempting to
speculate that the significantly higher protein expression
seen in myoblasts may result from the significantly higher
levels of ATIP1 mRNA identified in these cells and this
possibility warrants further investigation.
As growth factors, for example, Ang II and EGF, are
implicated in the development of hypertension and other
cardiovascular diseases, and as the anti-tATIP antibody
used in our work cannot discriminate between the various
ATIP proteins in whole cells, we investigated whether these
agents induced changes in the expression levels of mRNA
for the ATIP isoforms and the Ang II receptors. Using the
endogenous AT1- and AT2-receptor agonist Ang II and epi-
dermal growth factor EGF, we attempted to simulate condi-
tions similar to those that occur during hypertension.
Previously, we identified that stimulation of LNCaP and
PC3 cells with EGF or Ang II significantly decreased the
expression of tATIP and ATIP1 mRNA but had no effect on
the levels of AT1- and AT2-receptor mRNA.46 By contrast,
in rat myoblast and myotubules, treatment with either EGF
or Ang II did not affect ATIP mRNA expression (data not
shown).
In functional studies by contrast and consistent with pre-
vious reports,12,14,17,51­55 EGF and Ang II induced cellular
hypertrophy in both H9c2 myoblasts and myotubules
(Figure 3). Although some studies have linked the hyper-
trophic effects of Ang II to activation of the AT2-
receptor,33,56­58 most studies indicate the AT1-receptor is the
primary mediator of Ang II-induced cellular hypertro-
phy.7,12,17,28,53,59,60 As our own results (Figure 2(a) and (b))
and previous work indicate that H9c2 myoblasts contain
few to noAT2-receptors,50 we were somewhat surprised that
the AT2-receptor agonist CGP42112A also induced cardiac
hypertrophy in the H9c2 cell lines. However, although
CGP42112A is a selective AT2-receptor agonist, at high
concentrations it also has the capacity to bind to and activate
the AT1-receptor.61,62 Therefore, to examine whether the
cellular hypertrophy observed with CGP42112A was
possibly mediated via the AT1-receptor, we first incubated
the cells with losartan (an AT1-receptor selective antago-
nist) in the presence or absence of the equipotent Ang II
receptor agonist Ang II. In these studies, losartan inhibited
the ability of Ang II to induce cellular hypertrophy (data not
shown), suggesting thatAng II induced cellular hypertrophy
primarily via the AT1-receptor. Further studies were then
conducted to determine whether the hypertrophic action of
CGP42112A was also mediated by the AT1-receptor. In
these studies, which were conducted in both in myoblasts
and myotubules, the AT1-receptor antagonist losartan inhib-
ited CGP42112A-mediated increases in cell volume (Figure
1(a) and (b)); therefore, indicating that the Ang II receptor
primarily responsible for mediating hypertrophic responses
in H9c2 cells was the AT1-receptor.
Moreover, hypertrophy of the rat myoblast and myotu-
bules was accompanied by an increase or re-expression of
AT2-receptor mRNA, although this did not reach statistical
significance (data not shown). Other studies have also iden-
tified an up-regulation of the AT2-receptor with cardiac
hypertrophy;19­21 however, the development of the onset of
AT2-receptor re-expression is controversial and whether it
occurs following or prior to the development of hypertro-
phy requires further clarification.25,30­35,56,63,64
We also examined the effects of EGF, Ang II and
CGP42112A on myoblast proliferation using [3H]thymi-
dine incorporation and ERK phosphorylation assays.
These studies identified a dose-dependent increase in [3H]
thymidine incorporation following treatment with EGF
and Ang II for 18 hours (Figure 3). By contrast, but con-
sistent with a lack of AT2-receptor-mediated growth in
these cells, CGP42112A did not affect cell proliferation
nor did it potentiate the effects of EGF when given in
combination.
In ERK phosphorylation assays, we observed that in
both myoblast and myotubules EGF increased ERK2 phos-
phorylation and although while not having an effect when
given alone, Ang II significantly potentiated the effect of
EGF (Figure 4). This latter finding is consistent with work
conducted in vascular smooth muscle cells derived from
porcine thoracic aortas,65 which suggested that Ang II inter-
acts synergistically with EGF to induce sustained prolifera-
tion via complementary actions at different cell cycle
phases, as EGF has been shown to be involved in the early
cell cycle phases andAng II tends to be involved in the later
cell cycle phases.65 However, this finding contrasts with
previous work in which Ang II stimulated ERK2 phospho-
rylation in rat myoblasts.66 This discrepancy, however, may
result from differences in the incubation medias used as in
Kinjo et al.40 Ang II was given in combination with 0.5%
FCS, whereas in all of our ERK phosphorylation studies the
cells were serum starved overnight and during treatment in
an attempt to improve assay sensitivity. Consistent with our
[3H]thymidine studies, CGP42112A did not induce ERK2
phosphorylation (Figure 4), adding further weight to the
Varghayee et al. 89
possibility that the AT2-receptor is not a pro-growth recep-
tor in these cell lines.50
Although there were no changes in the expression of
ATIP mRNA following treatment with the hypertrophic
agonists, we further investigated the role of ATIP1 and
ATIP3 in these cell lines by over-expressing these variants
in H9c2 myoblasts. ATIP1 is the most studied ATIP vari-
ant,36,37,41,43 and it has been shown to inhibit growth factor-
induced ERK2 activation and insulin receptor
autophosphorylation.36 Moreover, loss or down-regulation
of ATIP1 mRNA expression promotes cell proliferation in
some tissues.37,41 In our previous studies in prostate cancer
cell lines, over-expression of ATIP1 significantly decreased
basal levels of ERK2 phosphorylation and EGF-induced
ERK2 phosphorylation was attenuated compared to control
transfected prostate cancer cells.46 By contrast, over-
expression of ATIP1 in rat H9c2 myoblasts did not affect
basal levels of ERK2 activation, nor did it significantly
inhibit the ability of EGF to stimulate ERK2 phosphoryla-
tion in these cells (Figures 5(a) and (b)). This was not sur-
prising, however, as we have previously reported that the
effects of ATIP1 over-expression are dependent on the co-
expression of the AT2-receptor,36 and our mRNA expres-
sion studies suggest that H9c2 myoblasts contain little to no
AT2-receptors (Table 2).
We also examined the effect of ATIP3 over-expression in
H9c2 myoblasts, the most highly expressed ATIP variant in
these cells, as to date there are little published data available
regarding the function and expression of this variant, par-
ticularly in cardiac cells. What is known is that ATIP3
expression decreases in invasive breast tumours,44 and over-
expression of this variant, much like the effects of ATIP1
over-expression in normal36 and prostate cancer cells,46
reduces cell division.44 Moreover, ATIP3 has been shown to
be a mitotic spindle-associated protein in breast cancer cells
and prolongs mitosis.44 In the current study we demon-
strated that in H9c2 myoblasts, consistent with its action in
breast cancer cells,44 ATIP3 over-expression attenuated the
effects of EGF on ERK2 phosphorylation compared to con-
trol transfected myoblasts (Figure 5(c) and (d)).
Due to the limitations of the cell lines used, it is difficult
to determine the relevance of the present study to humans.
Although ATIP mRNA is expressed in normal human heart,
albeit at relatively low levels compared to other tissues,
with the predominantly expressed ATIP variants being
ATIP1 and ATIP3a,38 the levels of ATIP expression in dis-
eased hearts have not been investigated and it is therefore
not known whether cardiacATIP levels increase or decrease
following the onset of cardiovascular disease. In spite of
these shortcomings, the current study suggests that ATIP3
may at least have a role in myocardial homeostasis and the
evidence indicating increased AT2-receptor expression fol-
lowing the development of cardiac hypertrophy possibly
suggests that ATIP1 may also have a role in regulating car-
diac growth.
In conclusion, the present study has identified for the
first time ATIP protein and mRNA expression in rat H9c2
myoblasts and myotubules. In addition, Ang II-induced
hypertrophy in these cell lines appears to be primarily
mediated via activation of the AT1-receptor. In H9c2 myo-
blasts, which do not contain AT2-receptors, ATIP1-over
expression had no effect on either basal or EGF-stimulated
levels of ERK2 activation, whereas over-expression of
ATIP3 retarded the ability of EGF to activate ERK2 phos-
phorylation, possibly indicating that ATIP3 can influence
cell growth and hypertrophy independently of the AT2-
receptor. These results suggest that ATIP3 and possibly
ATIP1, following the re-expression of the AT2-receptor
which occurs following the onset of cardiac disease, play a
role in growth factor-induced cardiac myoblast hypertro-
phy and growth, and further exploration of the underlying
mechanisms of their action warrants further investigation.
