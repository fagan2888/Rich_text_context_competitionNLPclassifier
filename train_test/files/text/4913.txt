Abstract
Objective: Taccaoside, a steroidal saponin, has been shown to be cytotoxic, although the
mechanism of cytotoxicity remains unclear. This study examined the effect of taccaoside on the
human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines SMMC-7721 and Bel-7404.
Methods: The antiproliferative effect of taccaoside were measured using the 3-(4, 5-
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cells were stained with Hoechst
33258 to observe morphology. Cell cycle and apoptosis were analysed by flow cytometry. Caspase
activation was detected using specific assays, and PARP, Bax and Bcl-2 expression were analysed
using western blotting.
Results: Taccaoside showed antiproliferative effect on HCC cell lines growth in a concentration-
and time-dependent manner. Taccaoside arrested cell cycle in the G2/M phase and induced
caspase-dependent apoptosis. Western blotting indicated that taccaoside upregulated Bax
expression and downregulated Bcl-2 expression. PARP cleavage was observed following taccaoside
treatment.
Conclusions: This study showed that taccaoside may inhibit HCC cell proliferation by inducing
apoptosis.

Introduction
Taccaoside (Figure 1) is a steroidal saponin
derived from members of the Taccaceae
family,1 which is composed of two genera,
Tacca and Schizocapsa. While members of
the Taccaceae family have long been used to
treat tumours and swelling in China,2,3 the
mechanism behind their anticancer properties
is not well understood. Extensive

investigations into the Tacca family have
identified potential active compounds,4 and
previous studies have demonstrated the cyto-
toxicity of Taccaoside and its structural ana-
logues in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
cell lines,5,6 although the specific mechanisms
of action of Taccaoside remain elusive.
HCC is a common solid organ cancer with
poor prognosis and high mortality.7 Therapies
for most HCC patients are inefficient because
of chemotherapy resistance and the toxicity of
chemotherapy agents.8 In previous studies,
several natural products have shown note-
worthy anticancer properties, indicating that
natural products may represent an important
reservoir for anti-HCC drug screening.9
The aim of this study was to elucidate the
antiproliferative mechanism of taccaoside in
HCC cells.
Materials and methods
Materials and cell lines
Taccaoside was purified from Schizocapsa
plantaginea (Hance) tubers according to the
literature.10 Human HCC cell lines SMMC-
7721 and Bel-7404 were purchased from the
Type Culture Collection of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.
Antibodies for b-actin, Bax, Bcl-2 and
PARP were purchased from Abcam
(Cambridge, UK).
Cell culture
Cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Solarbio Science
and Technology, Beijing, China) containing
15% foetal bovine serum (FBS) (GibcoÕ, Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37C.
Cell viability analyses
SMMC-7721 and Bel-7404 cells were seeded
into 96-well plates (1 Â 104 cells/well).
Taccaoside was added to the cells at various
concentrations, and each dosage group was
repeated four times. Cell viability following
drug exposure was determined using the
colorimetric 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay (Solarbio Science and Technology).

Hoechst 33258 staining
SMMC-7721 and Bel-7404 cells in the loga-
rithmic growth phase were seeded into
6-well plates (2 Â 105 cells/well). After 12 h,
various concentrations of taccaoside were
added to the wells. After a further 24 h of
incubation, media was removed and cells
were washed three times with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) and stained with 2mg/ml
Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich, Poznan,
Poland) at room temperature for 30 min.
Flow cytometry detection of apoptosis
and cell cycle
Cells were trypsinised 24 h after taccaoside
treatment and washed twice with PBS. Flow
cytometry for cell cycle determination was
performed using DNA PREP and DNA
PREP stain according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Beckman, Fullerton, CA,
USA) or for apoptosis using a PE/7-AAD
double-staining kit according to the manu-
facturer's instructions (Beckman). All
experiments were repeated three times.
Caspase assays
SMMC-7721 and Bel-7404 cells were treated
with taccaoside for 24 h and caspase activity
was measure using a caspase activity assay
according to the manufacturer's instructions
(Beyotime, China).
Western blot
SMMC-7721 and Bel-7404 cells in the
logarithmic growth phase were seeded into
6-well plates (5 Â 105 cells/well). After 12h,
SMMC-7721 cells were treated with
Taccaoside for 24h. Scraped and collected
the cells. Total cellular proteins were
extracted with RIPA buffer (Beyotime,
China) and quantified using a bicinchoninic
acid (BCA) assay (Beyotime, China). Equal
amounts of protein per sample were loaded
onto SDS-PAGE gels and electrophoresed at
80V for 30min. Samples were then electro-
phoresed in a separation gel at 120 V for at
least 90min. Separated proteins were trans-
ferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride mem-
brane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and
blocked with 5% milk at room temperature
for 1 h. Membranes were incubated overnight
with primary antibodies with shaking at 4C
and then with secondary antibodies at room
temperature for 2 h. All immunoblots were
visualized by electrochemiluminescence using
ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Solarbio,
China). b-actin, Bax, Bcl-2 and PARP were
diluted with 2% BSA (Solarbio, China)
(1:1000). Membranes were washed with
PBST (0.1% Tween) (PH7.5) for 5 times
after primary and secondary antibody.
Statistical analysis
Experimental data were analysed using
SPSS 13.0 statistical software (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) with significance set at
P < 0.05. Between-group differences were
analysed using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with the Bonferroni t-test. Data
were presented as the mean Æ SD.
Results
Taccaoside significantly inhibited the prolif-
eration of SCCM-7721 and Bel-7404 cells in
a time-concentration dependent manner
(Figure 2) (P < 0.01). The IC50 of taccaoside
in SMMC-7721 cells at 24 and 48 h was 2.55
and 1.72 mM, respectively, and in BEL-7404
cells at 24 and 48 h was 8.10 and 5.94 mM,
respectively. Furthermore, cell density was
markedly reduced in cells treated with
taccaoside.
To investigate whether the antiprolifera-
tion effect of taccaoside were associated
with the induction of apoptosis, cellular
morphological changes were observed using
Hoechst 33258 staining. Following treatment
with 4 mM of taccaoside for 24h, cytoplasmic
blebbing, chromatin condensation and
Sun et al. 1397
nuclear fragmentation could be observed
under a fluorescent microscope (Figure 3a).
PE-7AAD double staining was using to
detect taccaoside-induced apoptosis. After
exposure to taccaoside for 24h, the apoptosis
rates of Bel-7404 and SMMC-7721 cells were
increased by 56.8% and 70.1%, respectively
(Figure 3b). The increase in apoptosis was
significantly dosage-dependent in both cell
lines (P < 0.01) (Figure 3c). These results
demonstrated that taccaoside inhibited cell
proliferation by inducing apoptosis.
Cell cycle arrest also played an important
role in the antiproliferation effect of taccao-
side. The percentage of SMMC-7721 and
Bel-7404 cells in the G2/M phase was
significantly increased after treatment with
taccaoside for 24 h (P < 0.01). For SMMC-
7721 cells, the percentage of G2/M cells in
the experimental group was 26.17%, with
the percentage in the control group at
14.60%. For Bel-7404 cells, 23.60% of cells
in the G2/M phase in the taccaoside group
but only 13.77% of cells were in G2/M
phase in the control group (Figure 3).
Taccaoside treatment also increased the
percentage of S phase cells (P < 0.01). The
percentage of G0/G1 phase cells was sig-
nificantly decreased following taccaoside
treatment (Figure 4). (P < 0.01).
To determine the possible mechanism by
which taccaoside induced apoptosis in HCC
cells, western blot assays were used to detect
the expression of apoptosis-related proteins.
We found that taccaoside activated caspase-3
and -8 in both SMMC-7721 and Bel-7404
cells in a concentration-dependent manner
(Figure 5) (P < 0.01). These results indicate
that taccaoside may promote apoptosis and
necrosis by activating caspase-3 and -8. The
upregulation of Bax and downregulation of
Bcl-2 were also observed in SMMC-7721 and
Bel-7404 cells after treatment with taccao-
side. Increased PARP cleavage was also
observed in SMMC-7721 and Bel-7404 cells
following taccaoside treatment (Figure 6).
Discussion
In this study, we showed that taccaoside, a
steroidal saponin isolated from Schizocapsa
plantaginea (Hance), induced cytotoxicity,
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in two HCC
cell lines. Western blot results indicated that
taccaoside induced apoptosis by modulating
apoptosis-related proteins.
Taccaoside is a biologically active com-
pound found in various types of traditional
Chinese medicine, which represents another
route to the discovery of therapeutic agents

Taccaceae family have been approved for
cancer therapy in China,2,3 their anticancer
mechanism remains poorly understood.
Determining the mechanism of action of
taccaoside is therefore the key to under-
standing the treatment effects of Taccaceae.
In a previous study, taccaoside was found
to have significant antiproliferation effects on
cancer cell lines, inhibiting the HCC cell lines
HepG2, Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 with IC50
values of 1.2, 10.87 and 3.89mM, respect-
ively.5,6 In another study, taccaoside had a
significant antiproliferative effect in cancer
cell lines including HEK293 and HL60.11
Despite multiple reports documenting the
cytotoxicity of taccaoside, the mechanism
behind its cytotoxic effect remains unclear.
An imbalance between proliferation and
apoptosis is a characteristic of HCC cells, an
the antiapoptotic signal induced by multi-
drug resistance presents challenges in the
treatment of HCC using chemotherapy.12
Regulation of the apoptosis signal in HCC
cells is therefore a central focus in the
treatment of HCC.
Several types of steroidal saponins can
inhibit HCC cell proliferation by inducing
apoptosis and blocking the cell cycle.13,14 In
the present study, taccaoside showed signifi-
cant inhibition of two HCC cell lines, in line
with the results of these previous studies.
Based on our results, we show for the first
time that taccaoside markedly increases the
rate of apoptosis in SMMC-7721 and
Bel-7404 cells as confirmed by the morpho-
logical changes observed. Furthermore, tac-
caoside may also inhibit HCC cell
proliferation by blocking the cell cycle, as
our results show that taccaoside decreased
the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase
by blocking cells in the G2/M or S phase.
Caspases are the primary death prote-
ases, and their activation often triggers

apoptosis and cell death. Among the caspase
family, caspase-3 is the primary executioner
of apoptotic death,15 and morphological
changes and caspase-8 activation16 are
necessary for caspase-3 activation. Using a
caspase activity assay, we showed that
caspase-3 and caspase-8 were activated fol-
lowing taccaoside treatment. Cell morpho-
logical changes observed by Hoechst 33258
staining also indicated caspase activation.
Our results suggest that taccaoside promotes
an anticancer effect in HCC cells via cas-
pase-dependent apoptosis.
Our results also show that taccaoside
regulates apoptosis-associated proteins in
SMMC-7721 and Bel-7404 cells. Following
exposure to taccaoside for 24 h, PARP
cleavage, an important indicator of apop-
tosis,17 was increased. Taccaoside also
increased Bax expression and decreased
Bcl-2 expression. The upregulation of Bcl-2
can lead to the blocking of various apoptotic
signals,18 while the upregulation of Bax
leads to the activation of caspases.19 The
regulatory effect of taccaoside on Bax and
Bcl-2 protein expression may play an
important role in taccaoside-induced
apoptosis.
In conclusion, we showed that taccaoside
inhibited SMMC-7721 and Bel-7404 cell
proliferation by inducing apoptosis and
causing cell cycle arrest. Caspase-3 and -8
activation may also contribute to taccaoside-
induced apoptotic cell death.
