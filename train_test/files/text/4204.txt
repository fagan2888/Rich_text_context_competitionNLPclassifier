Introduction
Globalization is characterized by democratic expectations
among the governed despite the absence of a global govern-
ment; the legitimacy of globalization is maintained by "gov-
ernance without government" (Mayntz, 2002). The stability
of democratic legitimacy must allow for the "peaceful `play'
of power--the adherence by the `outs' to decisions made by
`ins' and the recognition by the `ins' of the rights of the
`outs'" (Lipset, 1959, p. 71). The absence of a government
results in accountability gaps that contribute to patterned
vulnerabilities that non-governmental organizations (INGOs)
bridge with the soft power of influence using knowledge to
shape the debate through evolving norms. Nye (2004)
defined soft power as "the ability to get what you want
through attraction rather than coercion" via a variety of
means including diplomatic relations, economic assistance,
and cultural exchange. A country is considered to have more
soft power to the extent that their culture inspires admiration
and respect in other parts of the world. INGOs address the
most difficult accountability challenges by representing the
vulnerable and using the power of persuasion to strengthen,
or undermine, the legitimacy of the global system (Risse,
2002). Willetts (1996) referred to them as the "conscience of
the world," exercising a form of bottom-up, rather than top-
down, accountability (Newell, 2008, p. 124). In the absence
of alternative contenders for formal political offices, the sta-
bility of global democratic governance becomes dependent
on effective dialogue with civil society partners who aug-
ment statist politics with civic life politics where govern-
ments are vulnerable to public opinion (Keohane, 2003).

Reflexivity in External Religious Leaders'
Summit Communication Sequences
(2005-2012) to G8 Political Leaders:
The Social (Re)Construction of
Cosmopolitan Responsibility by World
Religious Leaders
Sherrie Steiner1
Abstract
Religious governance influence in international relations is underresearched. Using reflexivity as primary governance indicator,
this case study examines the external communicational sequences of the only multifaith summits (2005-2012) whose purpose
is communication to, and dialogue with, G8 and G20 political leaders about global responsibilities to empirically discern,
independent of religious leaders' self-identification, whether the quality of dialogue is indicative of governance behavior
or unreflexive acts of international value struggle. Reflexivity is operationalized as historically embedded in social relations
using methodological cosmopolitanism. Findings indicate that religious leaders use cultural capital to blur (not reify) social
boundaries that inhibit international collaboration, and offer no evidence of unreflexive dialogue. Leaders use social capital to
socially (re)construct boundaries for cosmopolitan responsibility to include the interests of the vulnerable that are impacted
by, but excluded from, G8 and G20 decisions. This work contributes to the "empirical mapping" of religious governance in
international relations with implications for their consideration as dialogue partners for global governance.

Civil society participation in international governance is
currently an ad hoc, complex, and messy process with
numerous well-intentioned actors often working at cross-
purposes in destabilizing ways (e.g., Gupta, 2008; Steiner,
2011a). Political scientists struggle to ascertain which of the
numerous INGOs should be taken seriously as governance
partners, and relying on self-identification does not address
the need for quality control measures. Recognition by politi-
cal decision makers is also problematic given that the INGOs
most likely to hold decision makers accountable are the ones
least likely to be recognized by decision makers that do not
recognize a corresponding obligation for accountability on
matters of global risk. Buchanan and Keohane (2006) devel-
oped a complex standard useful for identifying governance
partners amid the throng of INGOs. They hoped their pro-
posal would temporarily help guide the network of leaders
tasked with identifying valuable INGO accountability part-
ners, and assist reform efforts by bolstering "public support
for valuable global governance institutions that either satisfy
the standard or at least make credible efforts to do so"
(Buchanan & Keohane, 2006, p. 406.) By developing the
standard, Buchanan and Keohane (2006) hoped to clarify
how the legitimacy of the global governance system "does
not depend solely upon its own characteristics, but also upon
the epistemic-deliberative relationships between the institu-
tion and epistemic actors outside it" (p. 411). Buchanan and
Keohane most likely developed the standard with secular
INGOs in mind; nonetheless, Steiner (2011b) compared the
first 5 years of religious summitry against their measure as a
way of ascertaining the extent to which the World Religious
Leaders' dialogue process might be important for gover-
nance in transnational relations.
But the differences between secular and religious civil
society INGOs should not be glossed over. The democratic
principle separating church and state discourages religious
involvement in politics to inhibit the governmental establish-
ment of religion because of the historic destabilizing effects
of theocratic religious surveillance of political decision mak-
ing and the suppression of religious freedoms (Bhargava,
1998; Shabani, 2011). According to Rawls (1997), the "zeal
to embody the whole truth in politics is incompatible with an
idea of public reasons that belongs with democratic citizen-
ship" (p. 767). Not all public religious impulses harbor such
monolithic zeal; however, just as not all religious organiza-
tions are monopolistic (Habermas, 2003, 2006; Stark &
Finke, 2000; Warner, 1993). Lack of attention to diverse
types of religious public engagement may have ideological
roots in liberal political philosophies such as that of John
Locke (1689/1983) who argued that all religious reasoning
should be excluded from the public square. But Lock's rea-
soning was developed in a context that presumed a develop-
ing nation-state framework; Lock's assumptions are not
unilaterally applicable given the current post-Westphalian
context, and his work has been critiqued as overly restrictive
(Waldron, 1993). New governing approaches are evolving in
a globalizing context that is devoid of any formal global gov-
ernmental structure (Mayntz, 2002).
Jürgen Habermas (2003) considered religion, in certain
contexts, to be an asset for strengthening the democratic pro-
cess. Religion communicates meaning in ways philosophy
and science cannot, and to repress it does more than unfairly
exclude religion; separating faith-based reasoning from pub-
lic discourse deprives "secular society from important
resources of meaning" (p. 109)--including the beneficial
type of religious reasoning (Habermas, 2006, p. 8). Max
Weber expressed concern long ago over how the overra-
tionalization of society might result in a dual crisis of man-
agement and meaning rendering bureaucratic governments
unable to generate the political will needed for resolving
social problems (Roth & Schluchter, 1979). Audi and
Wolterstorff (1997) suggested that impartiality, rather than
separation, is sufficient to meet the neutrality requirement
for political engagement. Alternatively, Roger Finke has
interpreted the separation of church and state as a political
act of religious deregulation aimed at protecting the free
expression of religious minorities in the religious market,
potentially introducing a new era of religious diversity
(Finke, 1990); the separation of church and state, according
to Finke, may have been intended more as a removal of reli-
gious monopolization than a removal of religion, per se, such
that diverse religious inclusion, rather than exclusion, might
mark the future of democracy. Campbell (2006) and Willaime
(2006) have indicated that further clarification of the com-
plex dynamics of religious engagement in the ultramodern
public sphere, with a particular emphasis on reflexivity, is
needed. Transnational religion as a form of civil society may
be emerging in a context of fading nation-states (Rudolph &
Piscatori, 1997). That said, scholarship on religious soft
power in international relations has been consistently
described in terms of dual streams where religious non-gov-
ernmental organizations (RNGOs) are described as either
threats to, or reinforcers of, the global system, but not as civil
society governance partners (e.g., Banchoff, 2008; Falk,
2001; Fox & Sandler, 2004; Haynes, 2009; Petito &
Hatzopoulos, 2003; Shani, 2009; Thomas, 2005). Religious
influence in international relations has been primarily
described in terms of a fundamentalistic impulse to remake
the world in the image of particular monolithic religious
worldviews (e.g., Bouma, 2006; Marty & Appleby, 1992).
Ulrich Beck (2005) described how the Bush Government
exploited the rhetoric of peace in the wake of the events of
September 11 to silence dissent and spread the "American
way of life" and American values as the only acceptable road
to a singular modernity. Islamophobia also increased (Eck,
2001; Halafoff, 2006) and an international "lawless space"
opened where human rights violations became justified by
U.S. foreign policy (Beck, 2005). Scholarship focused on the
return of public religion as a challenge to theories of secular-
ization and predictions of fundamentalisms' decline; little
attention has been paid to qualitative shifts and diverse
Steiner 3
approaches occurring within the repoliticized religious
sphere (Halafoff, 2013). Where governance implications
have been noted, as when Casanova (1994) concluded that
some forms of international religious involvement might
help modernity save itself "through a Habermasian practical
rationalism of the traditional lifeworld" (p. 229), any posi-
tive contribution religions might make were said to be unin-
tentional (p. 234).
Intentional governance as an explicit role for religion in
international relations has yet to be recognized in religious
soft power scholarship despite the "return of religion" to
international relations (e.g., Banchoff, 2008; Fox & Sandler,
2004; Haynes, 2009; Petito & Hatzopoulos, 2003; Snyder,
2011). Religious diplomacy also remains underresearched
(Halafoff, 2013; Johnston, 2003). Anthropologists tend to
offer anecdotal recognition of how religious INGOs have
played pivotal temporary "governance" roles during times of
social change such as when Apartheid in South Africa was
abolished in favor of the new South Africa or when the
Solidarity Movement rose to power in Poland (Berger, 2003).
Halafoff has identified religious governance capability
where religions "can act as both critics and partners of state
actors, on matters of common security within a cosmopoli-
tan, deliberative framework" (Halafoff, 2013, p. 18), but reli-
gious governance dynamics remains a theoretical box in
need of further research (Halafoff, 2013; Steiner, 2013).
There are several historic shifts associated with religion's
return to international relations that merit research attention.
The multifaith movement is one of the few global move-
ments to show empirical growth during the early 2000s
(Braybrooke, 2007; Halafoff, 2013, p. 16). World religions
coming together in dialogue with one another to voice global
ethics is historically unprecedented (Armstrong, 2007; Kung,
1991). Religious summitry where leaders of the world reli-
gions engage in intentional governance efforts toward seri-
ous, consistent and persistent credible conversation with the
political leaders of the world is entirely new (Steiner, 2011b,
2012) and in July of 2013, the U.S. State Department created
its first office dedicated to outreach to the global faith com-
munity and religious leaders (Tenety, 2013). Faith networks
are deeply rooted in local communities, strongly represented
among the poor and vulnerable, and are among some of the
best organized civil institutions in the world (Berger, 2003).
International relations scholars have begun to struggle with
the complex ways in which religion influences politics, but
they agree that a prime cause of the global resurgence of reli-
gion in politics is the rising demand for mass political par-
ticipation with religion particularly connected to populist
politics in the developing world where there is a perceived
failure of the secular state to address basic needs (Snyder,
2011).
Empirical investigation into religious governance in inter-
national relations requires identification of appropriate mea-
sures. For Habermas (2006), reflexivity is the key indicator
for governance communication; the absence of this skill is
what makes fundamentalism so problematic in the public
realm. Constructive faith-based public dialogue, says
Habermas (2006), must have "the epistemic ability to con-
sider one's own faith reflexively from the outside and to
relate it to secular views" (pp. 9-10). The Summits of World
Religious Leaders represent an important case study for
empirical identification of a governance role, if any, for reli-
gions in international relations because of the deliberate,
consistent, and persistent governance efforts that have been
made from 2005 to 2012 to engage top tier religious and
political leaders in dialogue about global risks (Steiner,
2011b, 2012). Religious summitry is diverse, having included
representation of all major world religions since 2006. The
religious network, measurement problems notwithstanding,
has been estimated to involve a constituency in excess of 800
million that is becoming increasingly politicized over time
(Steiner, 2011b, 2012). Empirical investigation into the
reflexivity of summitry communicational sequences furthers
our understanding of religious governance beyond the self-
identification and public involvement of religious leaders by
lending insight into the quality of the communication itself.
Accordingly, the research question reads as follows:
Research Question 1: In what ways, if at all, do the sum-
mitry communicational sequences (2005-2012) between
the world religious leaders and the G8 political leaders
demonstrate reflexivity?
The unit of analysis for this sample is text based on nine
statements derived from the World Religious Leaders'
Summits 2005-2012. First, I use methodological cosmopoli-
tanism to operationalize reflexivity (Beck & Grande, 2010;
Beck & Lau, 2005), and discuss how the dynamic interplay
involving shifting scales and multi-level reflexivity vari-
ously affects the governance process. Second, I consider
reflexivity in the case study of the summits from 2005 to
2012. Finally, I conclude by discussing the broader implica-
tions of these findings and suggest directions for future
research.
Theoretical Development and Data
Reflexivity is an abstract concept, the operationalization of
which is a complex process that inevitably involves the con-
structed interpretation of reality. The concept neither corre-
sponds to nor accurately and exhaustively represents its
object, but neither is the concept an arbitrary unbridled
invention. The concept is twice interpreted: first, by the par-
ticipants in the original context and, second, by the social
scientist (Drysdale, 1996). Distinguishing interpretation
from explanation, Max Weber said that interpretation with-
out explanation is not yet knowledge, and explanation with-
out interpretation is reification (Weber, 1904/1949). Social
scientific knowledge is only constructed when explanation is
constructed with interpreted concepts to avoid reification.

How reflexivity is operationalized affects the contribution
that theories of religious reflexivity might make to under-
standing the complex ways in which dialogue facilitates
trustbuilding across highly distrusting public networks or,
alternatively, legitimizes existing modernist forms of gover-
nance via "the manufacture of consent." Reflexivity has been
variously defined as the ability to see oneself as object, self-
critical reflection, or as thought turned in on itself freely
examining its own presuppositions and assumptions. Such an
overly agentic conception frequently reduces reflexivity to a
cognitive process, the ahistorical operationalization of
which--decontextualized from structural constraints--
implies a world full of more emancipatory potential than
what is practicably possible within actual embedded histo-
ries (Beck, 1994; Farrugia, 2013; Lash, 1999). Another
reductionistic tendency is to conflate the historical move-
ment toward social individuation (e.g., the detraditionaliza-
tion of community, family, etc.) with methodological
individualism (Chang & Song, 2010). Individualistic con-
ceptions of reflexivity uncritically assume a teleology of
self-mastery and imbue the theory with "sociologically
unsustainable visions of personal sovereignty and political
emancipation" that "celebrates a form of middle-class indi-
vidualism" (Farrugia, 2013, p. 2). The danger in using an
overly agentic conceptualization of reflexivity is that it may
embed a form of cultural capital within the concept and unin-
tentionally mask how underlying assumptions derive from
structural privilege (Farrugia, 2013; Sweetman, 2003;
Threadgold & Nilan, 2009). Efforts at countering these
weaknesses with a historically sensitive empiricism, how-
ever, reveal a new problem running through sociological
methods and conceptual frameworks--methodological
nationalism (Beck & Grande, 2010; Sassen, 2000). Situating
a study of religious soft power in the cosmopolitical realpo-
litik stream of cosmopolitan social theory allows me to oper-
ationalize reflexivity with attention to each of these
weaknesses--ahistoricity, methodological individualism,
teleology of self-mastery, and methodological nationalism--
by emphasizing the historical development and structural
embeddedness of diverse cosmopolitan coalitions of actors
in specific diverse contexts (Beck & Grande, 2010). The
nation-state becomes a variable associated with multiple
paths into second modernity (Beck & Lau, 2005).
International relations becomes marked by the complex
interaction between nations entering from various paths
including those marked by privilege, time compression, and
the embedded structural constraints of a postcolonial history
(Beck & Grande, 2010). Transnational relations are thus
characterized by a "cosmopolitan dialectic" of the centripe-
tal, unifying process associated with the formation of a
"world risk society" and the centrifugal, diversifying pro-
cesses associated with the coexistence and "hegemonic com-
petition between different types and visions of modernity"
(Beck, 2006, 2009; Beck & Grande, 2010, p. 419). Reflexivity
emerges out of the macro context as nationalistic identities
give way to transnational recognitions that nation-states are
interdependent and entangled with one another. In contrast to
the national perspective (which excludes the otherness of the
other), the cosmopolitan perspective reflexively includes the
otherness of the other (Beck, 2002, p. 18). It is a method of
inclusive oppositions that unveils and rejects the logic of
exclusive oppositions that underpins methodological nation-
alism (Beck, 2002, p. 19). This theory frame rejects the
notion that Western institutions move from modernity to a
21st-century postmodernity in favor of an empirical research
program that studies the historical ultramodern transforma-
tion of basic institutions such as religion, the nation-state,
and the family (Beck, 2010; Beck & Lau, 2005). For Beck
(2002), "`the cosmopolitanization thesis'is a methodological
concept which helps to overcome methodological national-
ism and build a frame of reference to analyse the new social
conflicts, dynamics and structures of Second Modernity" (p.
18). The perspective is able to grasp how the pluralization of
nation-state borders implodes the dualism between the
national and international with an inner globalization that
introduces a legitimation crisis of the national morality of
exclusion . . . it produces questions as to the distribution of
global responsibilities: Why do we have to recognize a special
moral responsibility towards other people just because, by
accident, they have the same nationality? Why should they be
free of any moral sensibility towards other people for the sole
reason that they happened to be born on the other side of the
national fence? What loses any legitimacy is the fundamentally
dubious assumption that such responsibilities are absolute
within a border, while their absence is equally absolute outside
this border . . . [C]osmopolitanism lacks orientation . . . There is,
in any case, a greater felt need for an evident ethical dimension
in the decisions. (Beck, 2002, pp. 19-20)
Beck (2002) described cosmopolitanism as involved, and
put at risk by, a global market that is a new form of "orga-
nized irresponsibility" (p. 26). The task of those living in
cosmopolitan societies is to define and construct a collec-
tively shared future crisis without adequate forms of institu-
tionalized action (Beck, 2002). The global sphere of
responsibility within the cosmopolitical framework is
accomplished rather than stable (Beck, 2002, p. 37):
Cosmopolitical realpolitik does not appeal (at least not primarily)
to shared ideas and identities, but to power and interests to be
brought into play. If we adopt such a "realist" perspective, the
crucial question is how the hegemonic "meta-power games" of
global domestic politics (Weltinnenpolitik) can be shaped and
interests pursued in such a way that they serve the realization of
common cosmopolitan goals . . . [H]ow can private vices be
transformed into public, cosmopolitan virtues? (Beck & Grande,
2010, p. 436)
Reflexivity emerges out of strategies of self-limitation
through the "recognition of the legitimate interests of others
and their inclusion in the calculation of one's own interests"
Steiner 5
given a realistic experience of global risks and material inter-
dependencies (Beck & Grande, 2010, p. 437). Sometimes
reflexivity is an expression of self-creation emerging from
the social capital accumulated within structures of privilege,
but for Beck (1997), reflexivity leads to a "paradoxical com-
pulsion for the construction, self-design and self-staging of
one's own biography" (p. 96), paradoxical because the sub-
ject must make "decisions, possibly undecidable decisions,
certainly not free, but forced by others and wrested out of
oneself under conditions that lead into dilemmas" (p. 97).
Ideas do not cause social change in this perspective, but ideas
may just possibly influence the unfolding of history through
the decisions people must inevitably make.
Whether a problem has a cosmopolitan solution depends on the
normative and institutional framework in which decisions have
to be taken . . . the basic message of cosmopolitan realpolitik is
this: The future is open. It depends on [the] decisions we make.
(Beck & Grande, 2010, p. 437)
Historically contextualized operationalizations of reflex-
ivity are admittedly conceptually ambiguous because the
principles and institutions of "Second Modernity" are as nor-
mative as they are theoretical, but for our purposes here, the
gains in being able to offer explanation, unmask privilege, be
sensitive to diversity and identify social forces of constraint
outweigh the costs associated with inadequate conceptual
clarity and double interpretation (Beck & Grande, 2010, p.
435; Drysdale, 1996). According to Beck, Bonss, and Lau
(2003), researchers bear a particular responsibility, having
"invented modernity," to "find answers to the problems of
both how to conceptualize the possibility of `other moderni-
ties' and how to arrange institutions of transnational, transre-
ligious dialogue for its supply" (p. 8). The World Religious
Leaders' Summits is one of these transnational, transreli-
gious social spaces where leaders gather to dialogue with the
G8 political leaders about how decisions in a globalizing
world impact the poor and the vulnerable. To adequately
study this dialogue, the theory frame must be sensitive to
diversity, social forces, interdependencies and structural con-
straints. Methodological cosmopolitanism incorporates
respect for the particularities of diversity, sources risks in
externalities (e.g., ecological risk, nuclear risk), as well as
internalities (e.g., insufficiently regulated financial markets),
presumes nation-state fragility and interdependent entangle-
ment, and expands the scope of study to include those "for
whom cosmopolitanism is not a lifestyle choice, but the
tragic involuntary condition of the refugee or otherwise dis-
possessed" (Beck & Grande, 2010, p. 417). Methodological
cosmopolitanism remains an appropriate choice despite its
drawbacks and limitations because it operationalizes reflex-
ivity in a way that captures the type of dialogue associated
with the topics discussed at the Summits (e.g., food insecu-
rity, environmental risk, etc.). According to Feindt (2012),
whether and how the plurality of diverse perspectives are
taken into account and become effective "are at the heart of
the quest for reflexive governance" (p. 164).
Data and Qualitative Content Analysis
Illustrative data were used as informative evidence to
develop, not test, the theory of religious soft power as reflex-
ive governance. This study covers Round 1 of the summit
process extending from 2005 to 2012. I conducted textual
analysis of the communicational sequences between the
communicants over the 8-year span. Summit statements are
appropriate indicators of the dialogue process because each
statement was written with the input and approval of all reli-
gious leader participants at each summit, and because each
statement was immediately delivered at the conclusion of
meetings to political G8 Sherpas and/or media representa-
tives for public dissemination. Finally, as the methodological
approach taken in this article is twice interpreted and there-
fore inexact, I have disciplined my interpretations by draw-
ing the meaning units, specific characteristics, and underlying
theoretical assumptions about reflexivity that require further
illumination from the literature review. While there is no
single correct meaning or universal application of research
findings, I have made every effort to ensure the transferabil-
ity of these findings to other settings and groups by offering
a clear and distinct description of the analysis process to
establish arguments for the most probable interpretations.
According to Beck (2002), the pluralization of borders is the
most basic indicator of reflexive modernization (at the macro
level). When people are reflexive, dualisms implode and bor-
ders that demarcate categories such as national or interna-
tional "are no longer predeterminate--they can be chosen
(and interpreted) . . . redrawn and legitimated anew" (p. 19).
Drawing on Beck (2002), I analyze the sample according to
the following meaning units: (a) evidence of accepting the
logic of inclusive oppositions, (b) evidence of rejecting the
logic of exclusive oppositions, (c) evidence of cosmopolitan
flashpoints, and (d) evidence of shared responsibility for
governance of the future, (e) evidence of rejecting the logic
of inclusive oppositions and accepting the logic of exclusive
oppositions was identified as non-reflexive communication
that serves to reify, rather than blur, boundaries. The texts
were read through several times to obtain a sense of the
whole before dividing the text into meaning units, condensed
meaning units, codes, sub-themes and themes. Examples of
meaning units, condensed meaning units, and codes are
shown in Table 1. The whole context was considered when
condensing and labeling meaning units with codes. When
possible, I used condensed direct quotes during aggregation
to reduce the amount of interpretive bias introduced in the
abstraction process of moving from text to code creation and
theme categorization. Examples of the aggregation process
are shown in Table 2.
Findings
The illustrative data are theoretically consistent with
Beck's claim that reflexivity emerges out of social context
as a requirement of surviving the modern social world.
Religious leaders displayed "embodied dispositions,"

Statement­Japan/Sapporo [Wrlss-J/S], 2008). Leaders were
specific about what governments and religions might accom-
plish together by illustrating actual examples of accomplish-
ments rather than by appealing to utopian values:
In the past 18 years, a combination of health interventions and
decreasing poverty levels resulted in a 28% reduction in global
under-five mortality rates--from 90 deaths per 1,000 live births
in 1990 to 65 deaths per 1,000 in 2008. Change is possible.
(World Religious Leaders' Summit Statement­Canada
[Wrlss-C], 2010)
Leaders consistently emphasized intelligent engagement
with real world problems in all nine texts, at one point noting
that the "crisis of poverty . . . is not abstract. It involves real
human suffering" (Wrlss-G, 2007). Policy recommendations
were often specific, such as when they recommended that the
G8 provide 0.7% of GDP for development assistance (World
Religious Leaders' Summit Statement­France [Wrlss-F],
2011), implement new Kyoto Protocols (Wrlss-J/S, 2008),
and fulfill the Millennium Development Goals (Wrlss-C,
2010; Wrlss-F, 2011; Wrlss-G, 2007; World Religious
Leaders' Summit Statement­Italy [Wrlss-I], 2009; Wrlss-
J/S, 2008; Wrlss-UK, 2005; World Religious Leaders'
Summit Statement­United States [Wrlss-US], 2012). At
times, recommendations were "biting" as when they said that
the "Economic Partnership Agreements" of the European
Union need "a dimension of ethical responsibility and a con-
vincing development agenda" (Wrlss-G, 2007). Leaders
made reference to scientific academies (e.g., Japanese
Science Academy in World Religious Leaders' Summit
Statement­Japan/Kyoto [Wrlss-J/K], 2008) or quoted
respectable scientific sources such as The Academies of
Science's Climate Change Adaptation and the Transition to
a Low Carbon Society statement (Wrlss-J/K, 2008) or The
United Nations World Food Program's Vulnerability Analysis
and Mapping Report (Wrlss-US, 2012). Leaders made refer-
ence to current events such as the L'Aquila earthquake
(Wrlss-I, 2009), the tsunami and Japanese nuclear disaster
(Wrlss-F, 2011), and the Arab Spring (Wrlss-US, 2012). The
needs of the vulnerable were always foremost with thematic
emphasis on poverty (Wrlss-UK, 2005), religious freedom
(World Religious Leaders' Summit Statement­Russia
[Wrlss-R], 2006), the position of Africa (Wrlss-G, 2007),
environment, and shared security (Wrlss-J/K, 2008; Wrlss-
J/S, 2008), financial and economic crisis (Wrlss-I, 2009),
investment in peace (Wrlss-C, 2010), reforming global gov-
ernance (Wrlss-F, 2011), and food security (Wrlss-US, 2012).
At no point did any of the texts reflect acceptance of world
rejecting dialogue (e.g., rejecting a sense of responsibility for
global risks).
There was, however, consistent evidence of rejection of
what Beck describes as the logic of exclusive oppositions.
Nationalism was criticized as leaders emphasized that
no country, regardless of wealth and power, can cope with
[today's challenges such as AIDS, & weapons of mass
destruction] on its own. We are all interconnected and share a
common destiny . . . We reject double standards in international
relations. The world should have many poles and many systems.
(Wrlss-R, 2006)
Leaders clarified that they respect state sovereignty, but
their support included commitment to "democratic and trans-
parent cooperation among states and peoples. It follows that
the security of one actor of international relations must not
be detrimental to others" (Wrlss-J/S, 2008). A de-centered
nation-state perspective was evident in how they viewed the
G8 process itself. "The voices of the other 172 members of
the United Nations are absent," they noted, and the voices of
the weak and vulnerable "must be included in decisions"
(Wrlss-C, 2010). Violent defense of religious boundaries was
just as consistently and persistently rejected by religious
leaders as was nationalism. In 2008, leaders stated that "reli-
gious communities have roles in building peace . . . all reli-
gions have at times been misused in fomenting violence. We
reject this misuse of religions and commit ourselves to
engaging our communities for the common good" (Wrlss-
J/S, 2008). In Japan, violent defense of boundary mainte-
nance was rejected in all its forms:
Terrorism . . . is never morally justified whether it is perpetrated
by individuals, groups or states. Moreover, military responses to
terrorism injure innocent persons, provide additional motivation
for terrorist groups and endanger basic freedoms in the societies
attempting to protect themselves from terrorism . . . Every effort
must be made to utilize non-violent means to thwart terrorism
and resolve disputes to advance peace. (Wrlss-J/S, 2008)
Leaders rejected environment or society and present or
future dualisms, claiming that "it is unethical to burden
future generations with excessive pollution or other gross
environmental imbalances. Development must be environ-
mentally sustainable" (Wrlss-J/S, 2008). And when leaders
met in Russia, they rejected ways in which a globalizing
economy objectifies human relations, stating that "humans
should not become either a commodity or an object of politi-
cal manipulation or an element of the production and con-
sumption machine" (Wrlss-R, 2006).
Alternatively, leaders accepted what Beck refers to as the
logic of inclusive oppositions. Leaders blurred the society or
nature dualism, expressing shared concern for the need to
"face up to environmental dangers . . . [that] divide what
should be our interdependent human communities" (Wrlss-
J/K, 2008):
Many are considering sincerely whether we can survive on the
Earth . . . We therefore now commit our resources . . . to the
transition to a low-carbon society . . . We shall seek to qualify
materialism and consumerism, control the overloading of desire
to the point of the destruction of nature. (Wrlss-J/K, 2008)
8 SAGE Open
Leaders blurred political boundaries, talking about how
world politics "needs a solid paradigm based on moral values
to address today's challenges . . . the wellbeing of each is
related to the wellbeing of others . . . [W]e all live in one
world" (Wrlss-I, 2009). Leaders were clear that any con-
certed response to the entangled problems of the modern
world would require international cooperation:
Current events around the world . . . make clear that people
everywhere are demanding that their fundamental dignity be
honoured. Countries must work together to ensure protection of
the right to freedom of religion as well as political self-
determination. Tolerance, openness and understanding of other
peoples' cultures social structures, values and religions are
essential to the very survival of an interdependent world.
(Wrlss-F, 2011)
Leaders blurred religious boundaries, stating how "reli-
gious traditions . . . summon their followers to the path of
multi-religious cooperation for the common good" (Wrlss-
J/K, 2008), but they also blurred the boundary between the
sacred and the secular:
Our communities are ready to develop dialogue with the
adherents of non-religious views, with politicians, with all civil
society structures, and with international organizations . . . This
dialogue should be conducted on an equal footing, in a
responsible way and on a regular basis, with openness to any
themes, without ideological prejudice. (Wrlss-R, 2006)
Leaders blurred the boundary associated with time, stat-
ing that
all humans live in one world . . . [T]he well-being of one is
related to the well-being of others and . . . the earth . . . [T]he
past, present and future are linked. Together, we must
acknowledge past failings, face present challenges and accept
our responsibilities to future generations. (Wrlss-J/K, 2008)
Other blurred dualisms include attention to how global-
ization is impacting the family, they expressed "concern for
the status of women and children in many societies" and
spoke about how "protecting them from violence and exploi-
tation is a common task" (Wrlss-R, 2006). In Russia, atten-
tion was drawn to the plight of "illegal immigrants" and "the
absence of adequate and uniform standards designed to pro-
tect them . . . as states re-evaluate their comprehensive poli-
cies" (Wrlss-I, 2009).
By dialoguing with G8 leaders, world religious leaders
provide a form of cosmopolitan orientation to a "disoriented
cosmopolitanism," offering reasons, derived from the major
religions of the world, for why G8 leaders should recognize a
special moral responsibility toward other people who just
happened to be born on the other side of the national fence.
In 2005, they explained how they
believe God judges nations by what they do to the poorest. This
means all of us in the prosperous world, governments, churches,
the media and populations stand under judgement, to the degree
that we fail to respond to such a situation with costly compassion
and generosity, so that we may help in God's name and by God's
grace to secure justice for the poor. (Wrlss-UK, 2005)
In 2006, they offered further reasons, explaining how leaders
from 49 countries from Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist,
Hindu, and Shinto religious communities were able to reach
agreement on how religion might continue to play a role in
developing ethics and strengthening social order (Wrlss-R,
2006). In 2007, an even more diverse delegation explained
the common belief in human dignity and justice whether
it was rooted in the Jewish focus on the protection of the
outsider, the Christian presence of God's presence among
the poor, the Islamic tradition of the equality of all human
beings, the Hindu concept of Sewa, or the Buddhist ethi-
cal philosophy embracing interconnectedness or the Shinto
belief in humans as children of the Kami (Wrlss-G, 2007). In
2007, religious leaders started to point out that the Heads of
State and Government, by adopting the Millennium Devel-
opment Goals (MDGs) in 2000,
recognised that in addition to their separate responsibilities to
their own individual societies, they had a collective responsibility
to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice and equity at
the global level and declared poverty alleviation as an
overarching goal of international co-operation. (Wrlss-G, 2007)
By 2008, religious leaders stood united in their common
commitment to justice and the protection of human life and
the well-being of the planet. From that point on, the leaders
focused more directly on offering reflections and recommen-
dations to the G8 leaders, offering a form of moral will that
might translate into increased political will by the G8 on
behalf of the poor and vulnerable. They consistently appealed
to the MDGs as a common point of agreement for shared
governance with the G8 on behalf of the common good.
Although the initial focus was less concrete and more
focused on "doing the right thing" in ways that might be con-
sidered utopian, religious leader statements quickly evolved
toward concrete recommendations that could be realized
with changed priorities--especially when it came to the
defense budget. "[E]xtreme poverty at a time of unprece-
dented wealth is a moral scandal . . . [W]e call for the funds
achieved from the reduction of defense budgets to be allo-
cated in support of sustainable development and poverty
reduction" (Wrlss-J/S, 2008). Religious leaders challenged
short-term decision making, urging G8 leaders to make deci-
sions with a longer time frame in mind:
[W]e are concerned about "short-termism." The kinds of long-
term responsibility and accountability by which we shall save
our children's future are not yet devised anywhere . . . we must
appraise ruthlessly what we have achieved for our ailing world,
in these times of planetary emergency. All religions hold life to
be sacred and interconnected . . . This compels us to ask [that]
you reformulate our governments'policies to be fair to all life on
Earth. (Wrlss-J/K, 2008)
Steiner 9
Religious leaders challenged the highly consumptive
economies of the G8 countries, noting that "industrialized
countries have caused a disproportionate amount of environ-
mental damage. The strategy of promoting endless develop-
ment and high consumption lifestyles must be challenged"
(Wrlss-C, 2010):
The concentration of the majority of the world's wealth in the
hands of a few, while an enormous number of people, especially
children, live in abject poverty, is a global tragedy . . .
[destabilizing] the world. We call upon all nations to return to a
life of moderation, self-restraint and active justice. This will
secure a hopeful future for upcoming generations and effectively
function to cut the ground out from under the feet of extremists
and terrorists. (Wrlss-R, 2006)
I was unable to find in the communicational sequences
any evidence of rejecting the logic of inclusive oppositions
and accepting the logic of exclusive oppositions as a form of
unreflexive communication that might serve to reify, rather
than blur, boundaries.
Rather, religious leaders offered their reflections as a way
of redefining the boundaries for G8 decision making, chal-
lenging the G8 leaders to prioritize the needs of the vulnera-
ble when they make their inevitable decisions. The texts
became a form of cultural capital used by religious leaders to
accomplish the social construction of cosmopolitan respon-
sibility. Religious leaders used the language of "calling" to
invite G8 leaders to redefine the boundaries of what they
consider to be responsible decision making:
[We] call on the G8 . . . and all peoples of good will . . . to life-
giving and life-sustaining progresses in the lives of our sisters
and brothers and our planet. We both call for and pledge
ourselves to the future of life. (Wrlss-G, 2007)
Religious leaders consistently spoke of offering their
reflections in a "spirit of collaboration and co-responsibility
. . . working together across religious lines for the common
good and with governments and other partners of good will"
(Wrlss-F, 2011). They spoke of shared agendas, mutual con-
cerns and responsibilities for shared governance:
We recognize that we share responsibility to be and act for the
change we want to see. We reaffirm our own commitment to call
on our communities . . . while building political support for the
changes we seek. (Wrlss-C, 2010)
Religious leaders consistently emphasized the importance
of choice:
The magnitude of poverty would be overwhelming were it not
for the knowledge that this global inequity can be transformed .
. . Change is possible . . . [Faith traditions call] us to a collective
standard of mutual care. Poverty is frequently the result of food,
energy and economic crisis originating in wealthier sectors of
society. It is also the consequence of . . . greed . . . [W]e expect
inspired leadership and actions to address poverty! Wealthy
countries must . . . invest 0.7% of Gross National Income in
development assistance. (Wrlss-C, 2010)
Religious leaders displayed an emotional rule that nega-
tively sanctioned despair and world withdrawing emotional
strategies by labeling them as irresponsible:
[T]oignore[oppression]inourglobalcommunityisirresponsible
. . . In the spirit of optimism and countering any mood of despair,
religious people commit themselves to be part of the solution, to
pray and to act with compassion for all victims. We seek to be
considered equal partners in the solution of these entangled
problems. (Wrlss-J/K, 2008)
Religious leaders acknowledged that setting new priori-
ties would be costly, but they offered to partner with the
political leaders by generating moral will and delivering
social services as a form of cultural capital offering political
support for the negotiation of structural barriers to build bet-
ter lives for the vulnerable:
humanity possesses . . . resources to [end] global poverty . . .
What is missing is sufficient political and moral will . . . [W]e
re-commit ourselves . . . to help generate that moral will at this
critical historical juncture. We call upon . . . the G-8 leaders to
provide courageous and costly political leadership by providing
the resources and making the structural changes necessary to
eradicate poverty. (Wrlss-UK, 2005)
Religious leaders seemed to recognize that different
approaches need to be taken for different paths to modernity.
For example, religious leaders recommended that interna-
tional development assistance be given directly to those most
in need with new delivery mechanisms "in those instances of
failed or failing states" (Wrlss-F, 2011). Religious leaders
called for collaboration as a counter to the hegemonic com-
petition that tends to influence the decision-making process:
In developing countries . . . growth, poverty reduction and
environmental stewardship must journey together. This requires
innovative leadership in these countries along with increased
collaboration between rich and poor countries. (Wrlss-C, 2010)
With each statement, the identified values are derived
from diverse religious identities, but the consistent reference
to current events, social problems, shared interests, mutual
concerns, and the responsible exercise of power in the deci-
sion-making process cumulatively indicate that this dialogue
process is about the negotiation and redefinition of the nor-
mative framework in which decisions have to be taken in the
hegemonic "meta-power games" of the G8 Summit process.
Discussion
In this study, I advance our understanding of religious soft
power as governance by empirically investigating reflexivity
10 SAGE Open
in the case study of the World Religious Leaders' Summits
2005-2012. Although religious and secular soft power is rec-
ognized as influential in international relations in the era of
globalization, only the secular governance role of soft power
has been widely acknowledged by scholars. Many studies of
religious soft power use a dichotomist description that
obscures a more complex and nuanced understanding of the
interplay between religion, nationalism, and social move-
ments. I shed light on this differential treatment of religious
and secular soft power through empirical investigation for
evidence of reflexive governance in the first round of the
World Religious Leaders' Summits.
Careful attention has been paid to understand reflexivity
as a historically embedded process. Using data from nine
summits held over a period of 8 years, I have described how
the network of religious leaders reflexively interface with the
G8 leaders to negotiate the legitimacy of their impending
decisions in light of their moral responsibility to the poor and
vulnerable of the world. Religious leaders do this by blurring
boundaries that hinder international collaboration and coop-
eration, and rejecting those who would use violence to inten-
sify those boundaries. Religious leaders offer cosmopolitan
orientation to G8 leaders who gather to make decisions that
impact a world put at risk by a global market that Beck
(2002) describes as a new form of "organized irresponsibil-
ity" (p. 26). Religious leaders draw on their cultural capital
to redefine boundaries for cosmopolitan responsibility to
include the interests of the poor and vulnerable who are
impacted by, but excluded from, the G8 decision-making
process. By influencing the normative framework in which
G8 decisions have to be taken, religious soft power influ-
ences international relations to the extent that G8 leaders
accept moral responsibility for the poor and vulnerable, tak-
ing their interests into account when making the decisions
that they must inevitably make. The findings illustrate a form
of second-order reflexivity where religious soft power
reframes the normative framework within which decisions
must be made in ways that enable conversations over border
conflicts to be transformed into conflicts over the drawing of
boundaries.
This work advances our understanding of religious soft
power by identifying an important transnational religious
governance partner for international relations within a theo-
retical framework that captures the limitations of constrain-
ing social forces. The Summits of World Religious Leaders
may be important for political leaders looking for gover-
nance partners representative of well-organized civil society
networks that are deeply rooted in local communities strongly
represented among the poor and vulnerable.
This study also offers an important corrective to overly
agentic interpretations of religious soft power by operation-
alizing reflexivity using methodological cosmopolitanism.
Religious leaders display awareness of real world events,
limitations, risks, and possibilities in their dialogue for more
justice on behalf of the poor. The theory frame provides a
contextualized framework for the realistic management of
democratic expectations as religious leaders dialogue with
their constituency, as well as their political peers, about
global risks and responsibilities. Religious leaders have been
theorized to influence G8 leaders only to the extent that reli-
gious leaders are able to convince, and access their constitu-
encies to politically pressure, political leaders to adopt
strategies of self-limitation through the recognition of the
legitimate interests of the excluded vulnerable others, and to
include the interests of the vulnerable others in the calcula-
tion of their own interests in light of the realistic experience
of global risks and material interdependencies. G8 leaders
are the ones who exercise power and influence with the deci-
sions that they make. According to Beck and Grand (2010),
"the basic message of cosmopolitan realpolitik is this: The
future is open. It depends on decisions we make" (p. 437).
Religious leaders speak into that decision process with ques-
tions of "in whose interests" do the G8 leaders make these
decisions.
Future research on reflexive governance will need to
explore whether and how the plurality of perspectives offered
by religious leaders is taken into account by third-party
observers and/or the G8 leaders themselves. Further research
is also needed to explore how governance dynamics operate
within religious networks including the interplay between
first-order and second-order reflexivity in the ongoing
Summit process (Rhodes, 1997, 2003, 2007). In what ways is
the Summit process affected by tensions between pressures
to maintain action capacity and pressures to open up prob-
lem handling for further contextualization (Voss, Bauknecht,
& Kemp, 2006; Voss & Kemp, 2005)?Are there points where
the Summit process became so focused on problem solving
that they ceased to ask the larger questions? Are there times
when leaders were so focused on questioning underlying
assumptions and priorities that the strategic capabilities of
the gathering eroded? Does the Summit process vacillate
between the two extremes, or does the process at some point
open up to adopt a diverse portfolio strategy of experiments
and alternate frameworks of problem definition, goals and
options? Further research is also needed to determine the
extent to which religious leaders actually represent their con-
stituencies and are able to mobilize them toward political
engagement on behalf of the interests of the vulnerable.
