Article
One of the overarching questions in criminological and crimi-
nal justice (CJ) research concerns uncovering variables that
predict contact with the CJ system (Owen, 2014; Sampson &
Lauritsen, 1997). To be sure, a wealth of research has exam-
ined factors thought to increase the likelihood of arrest and
formal processing and little debate exists concerning at least
one fact: Contact with the CJ system is not a random occur-
rence (Sampson & Lauritsen, 1997). Indeed, demographic
factors including race (Sampson & Lauritsen, 1997; Walsh,
2004), age (Moffitt, 1993), and gender (Ferguson & Horwood,
2002), as well as personality traits and developmental pro-
cesses (Gottfredson & Hirschi, 1990; Moffitt, 1993) all cor-
relate with varying levels of risk for arrest, incarceration, and
formal sentencing. What is noticeably lacking, however, is an
effort to examine the role of genetic factors in predicting con-
tact with the CJ system (Owen, 2014).
The evidence implicating genetic factors as source of
variance for antisocial and criminal behavior in general is
overwhelming (Ferguson, 2010; Mason & Frick, 1994; Miles
& Carey, 1997; Plomin, DeFries, Knopik, & Neiderhiser,
2013; Rhee & Waldman, 2002). The vast majority of
researchers in criminology, however, have labored under the
assumption that genetic factors play only a minimal part in
predicting who in the population will be arrested, incarcer-
ated, and formally sentenced (Cullen, 2011). This approach
may ultimately prove shortsighted given the wide array of
human outcomes influenced by genetic factors (Chabris
et al., 2015; Polderman et al., 2015; Turkheimer, 2000). The
current study, thus, is intended to be a step toward uncover-
ing sources of variation--both environmental and genetic--
for CJ processing. First, however, it is important to discuss
prior research pertaining to the heritability of antisocial,
aggressive, and criminal behaviors.
The Heritability of Antisocial Behavior
Evidence concerning the heritability of human behavior can
be traced largely to work in the field of behavior genetics
(Plomin et al., 2013). The science of behavior genetics is
devoted to examining the origin of individual differences
(Turkheimer, 2000). Put differently, behavioral genetic
research utilizes sibling pairs of varying degrees of genetic
relatedness (i.e., monozygotic [MZ] twins, dizygotic [DZ]
twins, full siblings, and half siblings) to uncover sources of
variation for physiological, pathological, psychopathological,

On the Heritability of Criminal Justice
Processing
Brian B. Boutwell1 and Eric J. Connolly2
Abstract
An impressive number of researchers have devoted a great amount of effort toward examining various predictors of
criminal justice (CJ) processing outcomes. Indeed, a vast amount of research has examined various individual- and aggregate-
level predictors of arrests, incarceration, and sentencing decisions. To this point, less attention has been devoted toward
uncovering the relative contribution of genetic and environmental effects on variation in risk for CJ processing. As a result,
the current study employs a behavioral genetic design to help fill this void in the existing literature. Using twin data from
a national sample of youth, the current study produced evidence suggesting that genetic factors accounted for at least a
portion of variance in risk for incarceration among female twins and probation among male twins. Shared and nonshared
environmental influences accounted for the variance in risk for arrest among both female and male twins, probation among
female twins, and incarceration among male twins. Ultimately, it appears that risk for contact with the CJ system and CJ
processing is structured by a combination of factors beyond shared cultural and neighborhood environments, and appears to
also include genetic factors. Moving forward, continuing to not use genetically sensitive research designs capable of estimating
the role of genetic and nonshared environmental influences on CJ outcomes may result in misleading results.

and behavioral outcomes (Turkheimer, 2000). Because MZ
twins share, on average, twice as much genetic material as DZ
twins, it is assumed that if MZ twins resemble one another
more closely than DZ twins for a certain trait, then genetic
factors may be contributing to variation in that particular out-
come (Plomin et al., 2013). If the similarity of DZ twins and
full siblings, which share on average 50% of their genetic
material, is greater than that of half siblings, which share 25%
of their genetic material, moreover, the conclusion regarding
genetic influences is further underscored (Plomin et al.,
2013).
Put more directly, behavioral genetic research divides
trait variance into that which is the result of heritability (h2),
that which is the result of the shared environment (c2), and
that which is due to the nonshared environment (e2) (Plomin
et al., 2013). Prior researchers have discussed these concepts
in great detail so they will not be belabored here (for a thor-
ough methodological treatment of various concepts and
assumptions of twin models, see Barnes et al., 2014). For
definitional purposes, however, heritability refers to the pro-
portion of variance in a given trait due to variation at the
genetic level (Plomin et al., 2013). The shared environment
represents environmental influences that serve to increase
the resemblance of twins or siblings on the outcome measure
under investigation. Nonshared environments represent the
unique experiences of twins or siblings that function to cre-
ate differences on the outcome measure under investigation
between children in the same family. Taken together, h2, c2,
and e2 will always sum to yield 100% of the variance in a
given outcome measure (Plomin et al., 2013).
The application of behavior genetic techniques is com-
mon in a range of disciplines outside of criminology (Rhee &
Waldman, 2002). Behavior genetic methodologies, however,
have recently gained some traction in the study of crime and
delinquency. This growing line of research has produced evi-
dence that abstention from delinquency (Barnes, Beaver, &
Boutwell, 2011), onset of delinquency (DeLisi, Beaver,
Wright, & Vaughn, 2008), chronic criminality (Barnes &
Boutwell, 2012), changes in delinquency (Connolly,
Schwartz, Nedelec, Beaver, & Barnes, 2015), delinquent
peer affiliation (Beaver, Ratchford, & Ferguson, 2009), and
victimization (Barnes et al., 2011; Beaver et al., 2009) are
all, to some degree, heritable.
Personality traits corresponding to risk of criminal and
delinquent behavior have also shown evidence of being
under genetic influence (Krueger, South, Johnson, & Iacono,
2008; Rhee & Waldman, 2002). Studies, for example, exam-
ining low self-control (Beaver, DeLisi, Vaughn, Wright, &
Boutwell, 2008; Beaver et al., 2009; Boisvert, Wright,
Knopik, & Vaske, 2012; Connolly & Beaver, 2014; Wright &
Beaver, 2005; Wright, Beaver, DeLisi, & Vaughn, 2008),
negative emotionality (Krueger et al., 2008), and psychopa-
thy (Beaver, Barnes, May, & Schwartz, 2011) have produced
consistent evidence that personality constructs positively
correlated with crime and criminality are influenced by
genetic factors. Equally important, environmental exposures,
in general, do not occur randomly and seem to be at least
partly heritable (Kendler & Baker, 2007). Taken as a whole,
what this body of evidence suggests is that the behaviors that
are likely to increase the risk of arrest (i.e., delinquency), as
well as the personality constructs that are associated with
those behaviors (i.e., self-control), are influenced to varying
degrees by genetic factors. What is less clear, however, is
whether actual instances of contact with the CJ system--
including arrests and convictions--are heritable. Despite
limited research in this regard, there is reason to suspect that
formal processing through the CJ system may be influenced
by genetic factors (for a broad overview of a related topic,
see Kendler & Baker, 2007).
Genetic Contributors of CJ Processing
Early evidence concerning the role of genes in predicting CJ
processing outcomes was produced by Mednick, Gabrielli,
and Hutchings (1984) using a sample of adoptees. Mednick
et al. examined both property and violent criminal convic-
tions in adopted away children and their biological parents.
Although the results indicated that genetic factors may influ-
ence convictions for property crime (adopted children cor-
related significantly with their biological parents for this
variable), there was no significant correlation between
adopted children and biological parents for violent criminal
convictions.
A more recent analysis of adoptees was conducted by
Beaver (2011) using data on individuals participating in the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health
(Add Health). To indirectly tap genetic risk for antisocial
behavior, participants who reported having a biological par-
ent previously incarcerated were considered to be genetically
vulnerable for criminal involvement. The results were indeed
stark. Participants, for example, who reported two biological
parents with a criminal history were more than 4 times more
likely to be arrested, more than 4 times more likely to be
incarcerated, more than 8 times more likely to be sentenced
to probation, and approximately 8 times more likely to be
arrested multiple times.
Using a large sample based outside of the United States,
Frisell, Lichtenstein, and Långström (2011) examined con-
victions for violent crime in a sample consisting of millions
of Swedish residents. The analyses examined familial aggre-
gation across a range of criminal convictions, including con-
victions for homicide, assault, robbery, and arson (as well as
other types of illegal actions). The results provided compel-
ling evidence of familial aggregation for multiple forms of
criminal conviction. Importantly, not only did relatives
resemble one another for criminal convictions, the similarity
generally increased along with genetic relatedness of the
family members (though mating couples also displayed simi-
larity). This type of "genetic cascade" (Plomin et al., 2013) is
suggestive of a heritable trait. And, as Frisell et al. correctly
Boutwell and Connolly 3
pointed out, their results map with those of prior behavioral
genetic studies, revealing that at least a moderate proportion
of the variance in criminality is the result of genetic variation
(Rhee & Waldman, 2002). Lacking in this study, however,
were precise parameter estimates for the contribution of
genetic and environmental factors to trait variance.
The Current Study
The studies just described provide an indication that CJ pro-
cessing may be influenced by genetic factors, however, there
is less evidence directly pertaining to the heritability of con-
tact with the CJ system. Thus, the current study is intended to
directly test this proposition. It is important to note that the
current study utilizes the same data set and CJ processing
variables as prior research (Beaver, 2011; Beaver &
Chaviano, 2011; Schwartz & Beaver, 2011). This analysis,
however, differs from earlier work in at least four important
ways. First, Beaver (2011) utilized adopted siblings in the
Add Health, and the current study uses the subsample of bio-
logically related siblings. The current analysis excludes any
siblings who were unrelated, yet residing in the same home.
Essentially, the sample of participants analyzed here repre-
sents a different sample from that of Beaver (2011).1
Second, Beaver's (2011) analysis employed an indirect
measure of genetic risk to estimate the broad effects of the
genome on risk for CJ processing. The current study ana-
lyzes sibling pairs to calculate pair similarity for a range of
important CJ processing variables. Third, using behavioral
genetic techniques, the current study is intended to estimate
the proportion of variance in CJ processing that is accounted
for by latent genetic and environmental influences. This was
not the intent of prior research (Beaver, 2011). Fourth, and
finally, prior researchers examining the role of genetic fac-
tors in CJ processing have examined the impact of measured
genes (Beaver & Chaviano, 2011; Schwartz & Beaver, 2011).
Researchers have become increasingly aware, however, that
candidate gene research has some inherent limitations
(Chabris, Lee, Cesarini, Benjamin, & Laibson, 2015; Dick
et al., 2015). As such, tremendous caution should be taken
when examining the impact of individual genes on complex
behaviors.
Method
Data
The data included in this study were taken from the fourth
wave of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to
Adult Health (Add Health; Harris, Halpern, Smolen, &
Haberstick, 2006). The Add Health is a multiwave sample
spanning decades of development beginning in early adoles-
cence and traversing into adulthood. Data collection began in
1994 while respondents were enrolled in middle and high
school. Three waves of subsequent data collection were
undertaken with respondents at each wave reporting on top-
ics ranging from their personality traits, sexual activity, crim-
inal involvement, victimization, family structures, and
existing medical conditions.
A useful feature of the Add Health sample is that sibling
pairs, of varying degrees of genetic relatedness (i.e., MZ
twins, DZ twins, full siblings, half siblings) and nonrelated
siblings (i.e., step siblings living together in the same home),
were actively recruited for participation in data collection
(Harris et al., 2006). Participants indicating that they had a
sibling were (along with their co-twin) selected with 100%
certainty (Harris et al., 2006). The resulting sampling proce-
dure netted 307 MZ twin pairs and 452 DZ twin pairs. The
current study analyzes twin pairs who provided a response to
each CJ outcome. As such, the final analytic sample included
214 MZ twin pairs and 326 DZ twin pairs.
Measures
CJ contact. During the fourth, and most recent, wave of data
collection, respondents in the Add Health sample were asked
to indicate whether they had ever been arrested, incarcerated,
or placed on probation (Beaver, 2011; Beaver & Chaviano,
2011; Schwartz & Beaver, 2011). Responses to the arrest and
incarceration items were coded dichotomously such that 1 =
yes and 0 = no. Responses to the item assessing probation,
however, was originally coded so that 0 = zero times, 1 =
once, and 2 = more than once. For ease of interpretation and
consistency with other CJ processing measures, the item
assessing probation during the fourth wave was dichoto-
mized such that 1 = ever convicted/placed on probation and
0 = no convictions/probation sentences.
Plan of Analysis
The plan of analysis for the current study involves a series
of steps intended to systematically examine the genetic
and environmental contributions to contact with the CJ
system and CJ processing. The first step involved calcu-
lating between-sibling correlations for MZ twins and DZ
twins for the arrest, incarceration, and probation mea-
sures. This step was carried out to examine whether
genetic influences may explain a degree of variation in
liability for each outcome. If the correlation on an out-
come for MZ twins (who share close to 100% of their
genetic material) is stronger than the correlation for DZ
twins (who share, on average, 50% of their genetic mate-
rial), then this can be interpreted as preliminary evidence
suggesting that genetic factors account for a degree of
variation in the outcome measure.
The second step was to calculate intraclass odds ratios
(ORs) for each of the outcomes described above (Cho, Guo,
Iritani, & Hallfors, 2006). The logistic regression equation
estimated in this phase of the analytical process assumes the
following form:

The interpretation of coefficient b
1
remains straightforward,
although it departs slightly from other forms of logistic
regression analysis. In this case, the coefficient can be trans-
formed (i.e., exponentiated to represent an OR) so that the
parameter estimate captures the odds that Sibling 1 has a 1 on
the outcome variable based on their sibling's (i.e., Sibling 2)
score on the same measure--in this case one of the CJ pro-
cessing items (Barnes et al., 2011). Importantly, genetic
influences from this portion of the analysis are inferred if the
similarity of sibling pairs increases along with their genetic
relatedness (i.e., if MZ twins are more similar than DZ twins;
Plomin et al., 2013).
The third step in the study was to directly estimate the
proportion of variance in each CJ measure as well as the
composite CJ measure that was the result of genetic and
environmental influences. To estimate these effects, a series
of univariate ACE models were fitted to the data. Biometric
ACE models are capable of partitioning variance of a mea-
surable outcome into three latent variance components: an
additive genetic component (symbolized as A), a shared
environmental component (symbolized as C), and a non-
shared environmental component, which also includes mea-
surement error (symbolized as E). Variation in an outcome
explained by additive genetic effects suggests that genetic
differences between sibling pairs explain individual differ-
ences in the outcome under investigation.
Variation in an outcome explained by shared environmen-
tal effects suggests that shared environmental experiences
between siblings explain similarities in a given outcome
under investigation. In contrast, variation in an outcome
accounted for by nonshared environmental effects suggests
that unique environmental experiences between siblings
explain differences in an outcome under investigation. The
nonshared environmental component also includes the
effects of measurement error. The assumptions of the twin-
based research design have been tested several different
times and in many different ways with results indicating that
the twin-based research method produces reliable and stable
estimates of genetic and environmental effects on pheno-
typic variance, even when underlying assumptions are vio-
lated (Barnes et al., 2014).
Given the dichotomous nature of the data, liability-thresh-
old ACE models were estimated to assess the magnitude of
additive genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared envi-
ronmental effects on variation in liability for arrest, incarcera-
tion, and probation (Prescott, 2004). ACE models were
estimated using the statistical software program Mplus 7.1
(Muthén & Muthén, 1998-2012) with a weighted least squares
estimator. Model fit was evaluated based on an adjusted chi-
square difference test statistic, the comparative fit index (CFI),
and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA).
Based on prior literature, the following model fit cutoff points
were used to assess satisfactory model fit: CFI  .90, Tucker­
Lewis index (TLI)  .95, and RMSEA  .05 (Hu & Bentler,
1999).
Results
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for each outcome
measure. As can be seen, close to 28% of the twin sample
reported having been arrested in their lifetime. Males were
significantly more likely to report having been arrested com-
pared with females ((1), 2 = 44.96, p < .01). Table 1 also
shows that 15% of the twin sample reported having been
incarcerated in their lifetime and close to 12% of the sample
reported having been on probation in their lifetime. Males
were significantly more likely to report having been incar-
cerated ((1), 2 = 36.20, p < .01) and on probation ((1), 2 =
54.67, p < .01) compared with females.
Table 2 contains the between-sibling tetrachoric correla-
tion estimates for arrest, incarceration, and probation.
Estimates from the full twin sample including same-sex
female and male twins revealed that MZ twins reported
stronger correlations for arrest, incarceration, and probation,
compared with DZ twins. However, the pattern of correla-
tions was slightly altered when examining female and male
twins separately. Specifically, the correlations for arrest were
slightly stronger for female MZ twins compared with same-
sex female DZ twins and considerably stronger for incarcera-
tion. However, same-sex female DZ twins reported a slightly
stronger correlation for probation compared with female MZ
twins, but the correlations were nonsignificant. With respect
to male twins, male MZ twins demonstrated a slightly stron-
ger similarity for arrest compared with same-sex male DZ
twins and a moderately stronger correlation for probation.
The strength of the correlation for incarceration between
male MZ and same-sex DZ twins was almost identical and
nonsignificant.

Table 3 contains the results of the intraclass logistic
regression analysis described in the plan of analysis. As can
be seen in Table 3, the odds of arrest were significantly
higher if MZ twins reported having a co-twin who was also
arrested (OR = 7.02, p < .01, 95% confidence interval [CI] =
[3.48, 14.18]). This estimate was higher compared with DZ
twins who reported having a co-twin who was also arrested
(OR = 3.98, p < .01. 95% CI = [2.41, 6.59]). This pattern of
results was consistent across all other outcomes when exam-
ining the full twin sample. When female and male twins were
examined separately, the odds of arrest were significantly
higher for female and male MZ twins compared with same-
sex DZ twins. However, the odds of probation for female MZ
twins were nonsignificant and smaller compared with same-
sex female DZ twins, while the odds of incarceration for
male MZ and same-sex DZ twins were nonsignificant.
The final step in the analytic plan was to directly esti-
mate the proportion of variance in CJ processing measures
that was attributable to genetic and environmental effects.
We fitted a series of univariate ACE models to the data on
arrest, incarceration, and probation. Based on the evidence
from previous steps in the analysis on sex differences in the
magnitude of genetic and environmental effects on varia-
tion in risk for CJ processing, model fit statistics were used
to evaluate whether model parameters could be equated
across sex without significant loss of fit to the model.
Results indicated that model parameters could be equated
across sex without significant loss of fit for arrest ((3) 2
= 3.51, p = .26), but not for incarceration ((3) 2 = 1.03, p
= .001) and probation ((3) 2 = 0.09, p = .001). As such, a
univariate ACE model was estimated to assess the magni-
tude of genetic and environmental effects on risk for arrest
using the full twin sample, whereas ACE models for incar-
ceration and probation were estimated separately for female
and male twins. Table 4 presents the parameter estimates
from a series of models examining the proportion of vari-
ance in risk for arrest accounted for by additive genetic,
shared environmental, and nonshared environmental
effects. As can be seen, constraining the additive genetic
component to 0, which resulted in a CE model, improved
overall model fit and provided the best fit to the data
(2 = 5.77, df = 1, p = .02, CFI = .97, RMSEA = .05).
Standardized parameter estimates from the best fitting CE
model suggested that 54% of the variation in liability for
arrest was accounted for by shared environmental effects,
whereas 46% of the variation in liability was accounted for
by nonshared environmental effects.
Table 5 presents the standardized parameter estimates
from the estimated ACE models examining the magnitude of
genetic and environmental effects on risk for incarceration
and probation among female twins. Model fit indices indi-
cated that an AE model for incarceration fit the data best (2
= 0.03, df = 1, p = .85, CFI = .93, RMSEA = .04) where
additive genetic influences accounted for 60% of the varia-
tion in liability for incarceration and nonshared environmen-
tal influences accounted for 40% of the variation in liability.
The best fitting univariate model for probation included only
shared and nonshared environmental parameters (2 = 0.00,
df = 1, p = 1.00, CFI = .80, RMSEA = .06). As a result, the
parameter estimates from the best fitting model suggested
that 49% of the variation in liability for probation was
accounted for by shared environmental influences, whereas
51% of the variance in liability was accounted for by non-
shared environmental influences.
Table 6 presents the standardized parameter estimates
from the univariate ACE models for incarceration and proba-
tion among male twins. Model fit indices indicated that a CE
model fit the data adequately (2 = 0.02, df = 1, p = .88,

among male twins was accounted for by shared environmen-
tal influences, whereas 74% of the variance in liability for
incarceration was accounted for by nonshared environmental
influences. With respect to probation, model fit statistics sug-
gested that an AE model provided the best fit to the data (2
= 1.44, df = 1, p = .22, CFI = .90, RMSEA = .05). Parameter
estimates from the best fitting AE model indicated that 57%
of the variance in liability for probation was accounted for by
additive genetic influences, whereas the remaining 43% of
variance in liability for probation was accounted for by non-
shared environmental influences.
Discussion
Criminology has devoted a great deal of effort to understand-
ing why some individuals in the population are more likely
to come into contact with the CJ system. Further understand-
ing the underlying influences on the predictors of arrest,
incarceration, and formal sentencing remain central to the
research agendas for both criminologists and CJ practitio-
ners. The current study was intended to press forward in this
area of research by examining the genetic and environmental
underpinnings of various measures of CJ processing (arrest,
incarceration, and probation). Although prior research sug-
gests that CJ processing is not beyond the reach of genetic
influence (Beaver, 2011; Beaver & Chaviano, 2011), less

research has used behavioral genetic methods to assess the
extent to which genetic and environmental influences
account for variation in risk for CJ processing. The present
study extended this line of work by examining a sample of
male and female twins from a nationally representative sur-
vey of youth. The results yielded two key findings that
deserve further attention.
First, our results revealed that shared and nonshared
environmental influences accounted for the variance in lia-
bility for arrest among female and male twins. Interestingly,
shared environmental influences explained the majority of
the variance in risk for arrest, suggesting that common envi-
ronmental experiences play an important role in explaining
why some come into contact with the CJ system. Although
speculative, some possible mechanisms involved in the
shared environmental influence on arrest might include
shared subcultural values, socioeconomic factors, or even
neighborhood factors (see also, Burt, 2009). Given the sig-
nificant role of the nonshared environment as well, tech-
niques such as those utilized by Beaver (2008) will be useful
in further exploring whether differences in exposure to key
crime correlates, like delinquent peer groups, might also be
important.
Second, results from univariate biometric models examin-
ing female and male twins separately revealed that additive
genetic and nonshared environmental influences explained
variation in liability for incarceration among females and
probation among males. Alternatively, the shared and non-
shared environment appeared to explain variation in liability
for probation among females and incarceration among males.
Although it is tempting to speculate about why genetic influ-
ences were different for different traits in males and females,
we should resist making strong inferences until our findings
can be replicated using larger, more powerful samples.
Nonetheless, what is clear is that the nonshared environment
consistently emerged as significant for every CJ processing
variable. What this means is that future research should make
use of twin and sibling designs to more thoroughly isolate
and examine possible nonshared environmental causes and
correlates of CJ processing (Beaver, 2008).
The current study was not without limitation, and it is
important to discuss potential shortcomings. The first limita-
tion concerns the measurement utilized to assess formal con-
tact with the CJ system. Respondents were asked to
self-report their contact with the justice system, and as a
result, issues with misreporting due to concerns over social
desirability could potentially affect the findings reported
here. There is some evidence suggesting that self-reported
items are both reliable and valid instruments for assessing
criminal involvement (Piquero, Farrington, & Blumstein,
2003; Thornberry & Krohn, 2000). The use of self-reported
items, then, may help to side step many of the potential prob-
lems surrounding the use of official statistics (i.e., the justice
system can only process crimes that are known to the police).
Nonetheless, the extent to which self-reported items have a
biasing effect on the results reported herein is an empirical
question that requires further investigation. Also, although
there is some evidence from the Add Health data that find-
ings from the twin sample should generalize to a broader
population of nontwins (Barnes & Boutwell, 2013), insight

about the generalizability of CJ processing from twins to
nontwins remains limited.
Ultimately, the findings presented here offer further evi-
dence that various CJ outcomes are influenced by a combina-
tion of genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared
environmental factors (Beaver, 2008, 2011; Frisell et al.,
2011). When considered alongside all other evidence per-
taining to the origins of virtually every other human out-
come, these results are to be expected (Chabris et al., 2015;
Kendler & Baker, 2007; Turkheimer, 2000). Indeed, the
sources of human variation for criminal behavior involve, to
varyingdegrees,bothgenesandenvironments.Unfortunately,
most criminological research examining CJ processing out-
comes do not focus on estimating or controlling for latent
genetic influences, which ultimately make it impossible to
distinguish between shared and nonshared environmental
effects (Beaver, 2008).
In light of the current results, future studies now have
even more reason to employ genetically sensitive designs
(Barnes et al., 2014). Such an assertion may seem odd,
given that some of the best fitting models presented in the
current study excluded the heritability variance component
entirely, meaning that genetic influences did not appear to
account for any of the variance in liability for CJ outcomes.
This reality, however, does not obfuscate the importance of
genetically sensitive research designs and the usefulness of
twin data more broadly to criminological research.
Importantly, commonly used standard social science
approaches that do not account for the clustering of biologi-
cally related siblings in an analytic sample cannot disen-
tangle shared from nonshared environmental influences
(Barnes et al., 2014).
Although some of our models did reveal that genetic
factors failed to account for any of the variance in liability
for CJ processing, every model revealed a significant non-
shared environmental parameter. While interesting, it is
important to remember that the nonshared environment
component also contains variance from measurement
error. That said, it remains critical for researchers to use
genetically sensitive research designs such as the MZ dif-
ference score approach (Pike, Reiss, Hetherington, &
Plomin, 1996) or sibling comparison approach to further
identify specific nonshared environments that might play
an important role in explaining individual differences in
CJ processing. Moreover, future research should begin to
examine potential endophenotypes (e.g., intelligence, low
self-control, psychopathy) involved in explaining sex-
specific pathways between genetic influences and specific
CJ processing outcomes. For the field of criminology to
remain a relevant voice in the study of human behavior,
there needs to be a shift toward examining the relative
contribution, and interplay, between genetic and environ-
mental sources of variance on both criminal behavior and
pathways to CJ processing (Barnes et al., 2014; Cullen,
2011).

Note
1. Beaver and Chaviano (2011) tested whether certain dopa-
minergic genes influenced the extent to which individuals
were ever arrested, sentenced to probation, incarcerated, or
arrested multiple times. For each outcome, genetic risk factors
increased the likelihood of criminal justice (CJ) processing.
Schwartz and Beaver (2011) also employed a molecular genet-
ics approach and tested whether certain environmental factors
conditioned the influence of genetic factors in the prediction
of CJ outcomes. Drawing on prior literature linking variants of
the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene to violent forms of
criminal behavior (Beaver et al., 2009; Brunner et al., 1993),
the findings from their study suggested that the impact of
MAOA on being arrested was conditioned by the respondent's
perceived level of prejudice, dovetailing with work indicating
that adverse environments condition the influence of MAOA
in the prediction of aggressive and violent behavior (Caspi
et al., 2002; Kim-Cohen et al., 2006).
