Data from the US population-based Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted from
1988 to 1994, were used to estimate the population prevalence, prevalence odds ratios, and attributable fractions
for the association of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with employment by industry and
occupation. The aim was to identify industries and occupations at increased risk of COPD. COPD was defined
as forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1
)/forced vital capacity <70% and FEV1
<80% predicted. The
authors used SUDAAN software (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) to
estimate the weighted population prevalence and odds ratios using 9,823 subjects aged 30­75 years who
underwent lung function tests. Odds ratios for COPD, adjusted for age, smoking status, pack-years of smoking,
body mass index, education, and socioeconomic status, were increased for the following industries: rubber,
plastics, and leather manufacturing; utilities; office building services; textile mill products manufacturing; the
armed forces; food products manufacturing; repair services and gas stations; agriculture; sales; construction;
transportation and trucking; personal services; and health care. Occupations associated with increased odds
ratios for COPD were freight, stock, and material handlers; records processing and distribution clerks; sales;
transportation-related occupations; machine operators; construction trades; and waitresses. The fraction of
COPD attributable to work was estimated as 19.2% overall and 31.1% among never smokers.

relative risk.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the
fourth leading cause of death among persons older than 45
years of age in the United States (1). Occupational exposure
is a known risk factor for COPD. Industry-based epidemio-
logic studies have shown that occupational exposure to inor-
ganic and organic dusts and to chemical agents can increase
the risk of COPD (2­4). In addition, general population-
based studies have identified associations between COPD
and employment in industrial and job categories or specific
occupational exposures (5­16). However, to our knowledge,
the contribution of occupational exposure to COPD
morbidity in the general US population has not yet been
quantified. The population-based Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) (17, 18)
enables estimation of the population prevalence and preva-
lence odds ratios for COPD and employment by industry as
well as evaluation of the magnitude of the effect of occupa-
tional exposure on COPD in the US population (19).
The objective of the present study was to analyze the
NHANES III survey data to estimate the prevalence, preva-
lence odds ratios, and attributable fractions for COPD and
employment by specific industry sectors (industry) and
occupational categories (occupation). The aim was to esti-
mate the magnitude of the effect of occupational exposure on
COPD in the US population and to identify industries and

occupations at increased risk of COPD that can be targeted
for etiologic studies or disease prevention programs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study subjects
The NHANES III survey was conducted from 1988 to
1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics in Hyatts-
ville, Maryland, to assess the health and nutritional status of
the US population. A multistage, stratified probability
sampling design was used to select a representative sample
of the US adult population aged 17­90 years (17). African
Americans, Mexican Americans, and persons aged 60 years
or older were oversampled. Eighty-one counties in the
United States were sampled; in each county and selected
household, the probability of a person being chosen was
based on sex, age, and race/ethnicity. The resulting total
sample of 20,050 adult subjects aged 17 years or older
included 47 percent females and 53 percent males; 42.3
percent were Caucasian, 27.4 percent were African Amer-
ican, and 26.5 percent were Mexican American. The survey
included a questionnaire, a laboratory examination, and lung
function testing.
The present study included subjects aged 30­75 years (n =
11,447). These age cutoff points were chosen under the
assumption that COPD due to occupational exposure would
not generally be observed before midlife (20). In addition,
many subjects less than age 30 years are still reaching their full
lung function potential (21), and many older subjects develop
age-related medical conditions that can affect lung function.
Furthermore, we excluded 1,009 subjects because of lung
function testing problems (missing tests (n = 826), unreliable
flow volume curves (n = 97), or only one reliable maneuver
(n = 86)), 506 subjects with physician-diagnosed current
asthma, and 109 subjects for whom occupational codes were
missing, leaving 9,823 subjects for the data analysis.
Definition of COPD
The definition of COPD was based on Global Initiative for
Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) working group
criteria (20) of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1
)/
forced vital capacity (FVC) less than 70 percent and FEV1
less than 80 percent predicted. The FEV1
percent predicted
values were calculated by using sex-specific reference equa-
tions for Caucasians, African Americans, and Mexican
Americans, estimated from tests of asymptomatic
nonsmokers in the NHANES III study (21). Lung function
testing methods for the NHANES III study conformed to the
1987 American Thoracic Society acceptability and repro-
ducibility criteria (22).
Cigarette smoking
The NHANES III survey included questions on current
smoking status, number of cigarettes smoked, and age at
which smoking started and stopped. Two smoking variables
were created: smoking status and pack-years. For smoking
status, subjects were categorized as never smokers, former
smokers, or current smokers. Pack-years were estimated by
multiplying the current number of packs of cigarettes
smoked (or, for former smokers, the number of packs
smoked when they last smoked) by the number of years of
smoking. Never smokers were defined as those who smoked
fewer than 100 cigarettes during their entire life.
Occupational coding
Occupational coding was based on two items on the
NHANES III Adult Survey Questionnaire. That is, study
subjects were asked to identify 1) the type of work they
performed for the longest period of time (occupation) and 2)
for this occupation, the type of business or industry they
worked in the longest (industry). In the NHANES III data
set, occupation was coded according to the 1990 Occupa-
tional Classification System used in the 1990 US Census
(23). These codes were derived from the 1980 Standard
Occupational Classification codes published by the US
Department of Commerce (24). Industry was coded
according to the 1990 Industrial Classification System used
in the 1990 US Census, a modification of the Standard
Industrial Classification codes (25). These detailed industry
and occupation codes are collapsed in the NHANES III
public use data set.
Industry categories used in the analysis
The NHANES III data set contains 44 industry and 40
occupation codes that include workers with a varied poten-
tial for exposure to respiratory hazards. A priori, we grouped
industries in which workers had a similar potential for expo-
sure to respiratory hazards believed to cause COPD as
follows. We kept the original industry categories, but
subjects with office work occupations were excluded from
the industrial sectors. Office workers from all industry
sectors were combined into a single category that was used
as a comparison group. This "office workers" category
included managers, secretaries and typists, clerks, and
administrative workers as well as teachers, writers and
artists, professionals, and workers from such nonmanufac-
turing sectors as banking, insurance, communications,
education, social service, and public administration. We
moved laborers, cleaners, material handlers, and mainte-
nance workers from the banking, insurance, communica-
tions, education, social service, and public administration
sectors into a new industry category called "office building
services." Similarly, we moved construction, horticultural,
medical, food preparation, and transportation workers from
the nonmanufacturing sectors to the appropriate industry
category with a similar potential for exposure to respiratory
hazards.
This recoding resulted in 26 industry categories. For the
final analysis, we combined categories in which odds ratios
for COPD were not increased into one category of "other
industries," which resulted in 16 final categories for the
overall analysis.

Occupation categories used in the analysis
The NHANES III data set includes 40 occupation codes
combined across all industries. A priori, we collapsed them
into 25 occupational categories believed to have a similar
potential for exposure to respiratory hazards and sufficient
numbers for analysis. For the final analysis, occupational
categories for which there was no evidence of an increased
risk of COPD were combined in an "other occupations" cate-
gory, resulting in 14 final categories.
Statistical data analysis
We used the SUDAAN software program (26) to estimate
the weighted population size, prevalence, and prevalence
odds ratios for COPD by industry and occupation. This soft-
ware adjusts for the sampling design in calculating the vari-
ance estimates (27) and uses individual sampling weights
assigned by the National Center for Health Statistics to
adjust for the number of persons in the population that each
sampled person represents. The weighted estimates are unbi-
ased estimators of the US population parameters (19).
The SUDAAN logistic program was used to estimate odds
ratios for COPD and industry/occupation adjusted for the
effect of age, sex, race/ethnic group, body mass index,
smoking status, pack-years of cigarette smoking, education,
and socioeconomic status (20). Socioeconomic status was
adjusted by using the poverty income index, computed as the
ratio of the family income and the poverty threshold value
specific to the family size. Industry (or occupation) was
included in the models as a set of 0 or 1 dummy variables
representing each industry (or occupation). Because of large
numbers and a low prevalence of COPD, office workers
were used as the baseline category against which other occu-
pational groups were compared. Preliminary analyses
revealed differences between sexes and among race/ethnic
groups in the size of the adjusted odds ratios; therefore, we
also conducted sex- and race/ethnic-specific analyses for
COPD to better identify subgroups at risk of COPD.
In an unweighted analysis, we examined trends in adjusted
odds ratios for COPD and increasing duration of employ-
ment in the longest-held occupation (ascertained by asking
the following question: Considering all your employers, for
how long did you do this kind of work?). For that purpose,
occupations were grouped, according to the size of the esti-
mated odds ratio for COPD, into high- and low-risk groups.
In these groups, the trend with duration of employment (0,
1­14, 15 years) was estimated by using office workers as
the "unexposed" comparison group.
The population attributable fraction (AFP
; i.e., the fraction
of cases with COPD due to industrial exposure) was calcu-
lated according to the following formula (28­30):
(ORi
­ 1)/ORi
where k = number of industry sectors; pci
= casesi
/total cases,
where casesi
represents the estimated number of COPD cases
in the ith industry and total cases represents the total number
of cases summed across industry sectors; and ORi
= the
adjusted odds ratio for COPD estimated for the ith industry.
RESULTS
Of the 9,823 subjects aged 30­75 years for whom lung
function tests were valid, 693 (7.1 percent) were identified as
having COPD. To assess disease severity, we compared
mean percent predicted FEV1
, mean percent predicted FVC,
and FEV1
/FVC ratio for subjects without COPD, with
COPD, and with physician-diagnosed emphysema or
chronic bronchitis reported on the NHANES III question-
naire (table 1). In table 1, subjects with COPD defined epide-
miologically had lower mean lung function values than those
with physician-diagnosed emphysema or those with chronic
bronchitis.
Table 2 shows the distribution of all study subjects and
never smokers according to nonoccupational risk factors for
COPD that were adjusted for in the logistic regression. Table
2 also shows the population prevalence of COPD according
to these factors.
COPD by industrial sectors
The overall analysis identified 14 industries with increased
adjusted odds ratios for COPD. Table 3 shows the estimated
numbers of US workers employed in these industries, the
estimated prevalence of COPD, the sample size, the number
of observed cases with COPD, and the adjusted odds ratios

gory combines industries for which the overall odds ratios
were not increased.
The results for never smokers provided supporting
evidence for the overall results. Although the overall odds
ratios for some of the industries shown in table 3 were low,
results from the sex- and race/ethnic-specific analyses iden-
tified subgroups with a higher risk of COPD and provided
further supporting evidence for the overall results.
The sex-specific analyses showed that for females, the
adjusted odds ratios for COPD (number of cases/number of
subjects exposed) were increased for rubber, plastics, and
leather manufacturing overall (8/46; OR = 4.7, 95 percent
confidence interval (CI): 2.7, 8.3) and for never smokers in

OR = 1.5, 95 percent CI: 0.6, 4.0) and for never smokers in

personal services overall (34/470; OR = 1.5, 95 percent CI:
0.7, 3.2). For the rubber, plastics, and leather manufacturing
industry, the detailed analysis showed that occupations in
this industry contributing the most cases were textile apparel
machine operators as well as fabricators and assemblers. For
sales, a detailed analysis showed that the adjusted odds ratios
were increased for Caucasian females (34/285; OR = 1.9, 95
percent CI: 1.0, 3.5).
Industries presented in table 3 that employed mainly males
were utilities, the armed forces, repair services and gas
stations, and transportation and trucking. However, use of
the male office workers group as a referent resulted in odds
ratios for COPD similar to those reported in table 3. The
prevalence of COPD among the male referent group was 5.1
percent (standard error, 0.9); for the overall referent group, it
was 4.7 percent (standard error, 0.4).
Race/ethnic-specific adjusted odds ratios for COPD for
Caucasians were similar to the overall odds ratios shown in
table 3. Industries associated with increased adjusted odds
ratios for COPD (number of cases/number of subjects
exposed) mainly for African Americans and Mexican Amer-
icans were office building services, agriculture, and
construction (office building services--African Americans:

were increased mainly for Mexican Americans were
personal services (15/161; OR = 2.7, 95 percent CI: 0.8, 9.7)
and health care (4/118; OR = 3.7, 95 percent CI: 1.3, 10.7).
The personal services industry included hairdressers and

COPD by occupational categories
The overall analysis identified 12 occupational categories
with increased odds ratios for COPD. Table 4 shows the esti-
mated number of US workers employed in these occupa-
tions, the prevalence of COPD, the sample size, the number
of cases with COPD, and the adjusted odds ratios and 95
percent confidence intervals for COPD for all subjects and
for never smokers. Occupations for which there was no
evidence of increased odds ratios were combined into an
"other occupations" category. An occupational category
generally included workers from several industries, but some
occupational categories were similar to industries (the armed
forces and agriculture) and were included for completeness.
Occupations that had the highest odds ratios were freight,
stock, and material handlers; the armed forces; vehicle
mechanics; and records processing and distribution clerks. In
addition, among never smokers, the odds ratios were also
high for other machine operators and for construction trades
and laborers.
Results from the race/ethnic-specific analyses identified
subgroups with a higher risk of COPD and, although based
on small numbers, showed a degree of consistency. For
Caucasians, the odds ratios for COPD (number of cases/
number of subjects exposed) were similar to the overall
results, but they were specifically increased for the occupa-
tions of records processors, schedulers, and distribution
clerks (23/180; OR = 1.8, 95 percent CI: 0.8, 4.4); sales:
retail and personal services (43/333; OR = 1.7, 95 percent
CI: 0.9, 3.1); and other machine operators (25/178; OR = 1.6,
95 percent CI: 0.8, 3.2). For African Americans and Mexican
Americans, the odds ratios were higher for agriculture and
construction, as reported for the industries. For the armed
forces, the odds ratios were increased for all three race/ethnic
groups: Caucasians (7/53; OR = 1.5, 95 percent CI: 0.5, 4.3),
African Americans (5/42; OR = 2.1, 95 percent CI: 0.7, 6.2),
and Mexican Americans (2/12; OR = 1.7, 95 percent CI: 0.1,
20.8). For vehicle mechanics, the odds ratios were also
increased for all three race/ethnic groups: Caucasians (9/66;
OR = 2.1, 95 percent CI: 0.8, 5.2), African Americans (3/25;
OR = 3.8, 95 percent CI: 0.8, 17.3), and Mexican Americans
(2/46; OR = 2.0, 95 percent CI: 0.3, 14.5). For transportation
and material moving, the increased odds ratios were
observed mainly for Caucasians (8/44; OR = 1.6, 95 percent
CI: 0.7, 3.9) and African Americans (7/55; OR = 1.7; 0.6,
4.8).

Attributable fraction for COPD
The overall attributable fractions for industry and occupa-
tion were calculated from equation 1 by using the estimated
population size, prevalence, and adjusted odds ratios
provided in table 3 and table 4. No cases were attributed to
industries in which ORi
 1.
For each industry, table 3 shows the number of attributable
cases. The total estimated working population aged 30­75
years was 110,300,000. Of these persons, 7,652,390 (6.9
percent) were estimated to have COPD. The number of cases
attributable to employment in industries, after adjustment for
confounding, was 1,467,290, resulting in an attributable
fraction of 1,467,290/7,652,390 × 100 = 19.2 percent. We
also estimated the overall adjusted odds ratio for COPD and
the 14 industries with OR > 1 grouped into one category as
1.5 (95 percent CI: 1.1, 2.0). Based on this odds ratio, the
attributable fraction was estimated to be 19.6 percent (95
percent CI: 7.0, 28) (31). For never smokers, the estimated
working population was 46,490,000, of whom 1,131,840
(2.4 percent) were estimated to have COPD. The number of
attributable cases was 352,167, which resulted in an attribut-
able fraction of 31.1 percent. For never smokers, the overall
odds ratio for COPD and the industries with OR > 1 grouped
into one category was 1.9 (95 percent CI: 0.9, 4.1), and the
attributable fraction was estimated as 27.8 percent (95
percent CI: 1.0, 47).
For each occupation, table 4 shows the number of attribut-
able cases. The number of cases of COPD attributable to
employment by occupation was 1,150,900 of 7,642,230 total
cases, resulting in an attributable fraction of 15.1 percent.
(Thirty-three subjects for whom there was no job code were
excluded, resulting in a slightly different weighted total
number of cases from the industry.) The overall adjusted
odds ratio for occupations with OR > 1 grouped into one
category was 1.4 (95 percent CI: 1.0, 2.0), and the corre-
sponding attributable fraction was estimated as 15.1 percent
(95 percent CI: 3.4, 25.8). For never smokers, the number of
attributable cases was 307,299 of 1,123,370 total cases,
resulting in an attributable fraction of 27.4 percent. The
overall adjusted odds ratio for occupations with OR > 1
grouped into one category was 2.1 (95 percent CI: 0.9, 5.0),
and the attributable fraction was 25.6 percent (95 percent CI:
2.3, 28.5). Because the occupations were summed over
industries and some of the industries with increased odds
ratios were not represented by the occupational categories
with increased risk, the attributable fractions for the occupa-
tions were lower than those for the industry.
Trends with duration of employment
The average duration of working in the longest-held occu-
pation was 15.9 (standard error, 0.1) years. For the high-risk
occupations (for all subjects, OR  1.5) shown in table 4, the
odds ratios for COPD by duration of employment--0, 1­14,
and 15 years--were 1.0, 1.4 (95 percent CI: 0.8, 2.6), and
1.7 (95 percent CI: 1.1, 2.5), respectively. The greatest trend
was observed among the armed forces, where the respective
odds ratios were 1.0, 1.4 (95 percent CI: 0.3, 6.1), and 2.0
(95 percent CI: 1.0, 4.0). For the lower-risk occupations (for
all subjects, 1 < OR < 1.5) shown in table 4, the respective
odds ratios were 1.0, 1.4 (95 percent CI: 1.0, 1.9), and 1.5
(95 percent CI: 1.2, 2.0). The results suggest a trend associ-
ated with working 15 or more years in risky occupations.
DISCUSSION
A recent study that estimated the cost of occupational
COPD in the US population assumed that 15 percent of
deaths from COPD is attributable to occupational exposure
(32). The overall cost for occupational COPD was estimated
to be $5 billion in 1996 (32). The present study estimated
that 19 percent (approximate 95 percent CI: 7, 28) of COPD
in the US working population aged 30­75 years is attribut-
able to occupational exposure. For never smokers, the attrib-
utable fraction was estimated as 31 percent (approximate 95
percent CI: 1, 47).
The present study generated hypotheses aimed at 1) iden-
tifying industries associated with an increased risk of COPD
that might be targeted for further research and 2) estimating
the attributable fraction for occupational COPD. The esti-
mated attributable fraction of 19 percent was based on
increased odds ratios for COPD in 14 industries listed in
table 3. Additional supporting evidence for an increased risk
of COPD in these industries came from increased odds ratios
for never smokers, for sex- and race/ethnic-specific sub-
groups, and by occupational categories. In preliminary anal-
yses in which a less stringent cutoff point of 75 percent was
used for the FEV1
/FVC ratio, we observed a higher degree of
consistency among the three major race/ethnic groups for the
adjusted odds ratios for industries and occupations. Use of
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
criteria resulted in a reduced number of COPD cases and
wider confidence intervals but also in decreased odds ratios
for African Americans and, to a lesser degree, Mexican
Americans. This result may be related to higher age-related
mean FEV1
/FVC values observed for the two race/ethnic
groups in the NHANES III study (21).
An increased risk of COPD has been reported for many of
the associations observed in the present study. Several
general population-based studies reported associations with
specific occupational exposures. A study conducted in
Tucson, Arizona, found an association between airflow
obstruction and self-reported exposure to silica, fiberglass,
sawdust, Freon (E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc., Wilm-
ington, Delaware), automobile exhaust, solvents, and
construction work (5). The US Six-City study found associ-
ations of chronic respiratory symptoms and COPD with
working with dusts, fumes, and gases (6).
In addition, studies in Norway found significant associa-
tions between airflow obstruction and occupational exposure
to quartz (11­13), ammonia, nitrous gas, sulfur dioxide gas,
metal fumes, and anhydrides (13). A study of New Zealand
subjects aged 20­44 years found associations between
airflow obstruction (FEV1
/FVC <75 percent) and working as
cleaners, bakers, spray painters, laboratory technicians, and
plastics and rubber workers and in construction and mining.
In addition, shortness of breath was reported more frequently
by hairdressers and chemical processors. Chronic bronchitis
was reported more often in food processors, chemical

processors, and spray painters and in construction and
mining. In a large international study of subjects aged 20­44
years, self-reported occupational exposure to vapors, gas,
dust, or fumes was associated with chronic bronchitis in agri-
cultural, textile, paper, wood, chemical, and food processing
workers (15). In the Netherlands, the Zutphen study found an
increased risk of nonspecific lung disease for textile workers
and tailors (relative risk (RR) = 2.4), construction and
cement workers (RR = 2.3), transportation workers (RR =
2.1), furnace workers (RR = 2.1), wood and paper workers
(RR = 1.7), and farmers (RR = 1.6) (33). Industry-based
studies of COPD have found an increased risk in textile mills
(34), the rubber industry (35), mining, construction, chem-
ical production, food products manufacturing, and agricul-
ture (36­39).
The US Work-Related Lung Disease Surveillance Report
lists industries associated with significantly elevated propor-
tional mortality ratios for COPD (40). In support of our find-
ings, the proportional mortality ratios for taxicab services,
trucking services, automotive and miscellaneous repair
services, construction, gasoline service stations, and the
military were among the highest. On the other hand, mining
and potteries, which had the highest proportional mortality
ratios listed in the Work-Related Lung Disease Surveillance
Report, were not identified by the present study primarily
because of limitations described in the paragraph that
follows.
To our knowledge, previous epidemiologic studies have
not reported an increased risk of COPD for industries such as
utilities, the armed forces, office building services, sales, and
health care and for occupations such as records processing
clerks as well as freight, stock, and material handlers. (The
records processing clerks category includes mail handlers.)
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
conducted several Health Hazard Evaluations in mail
processing and distribution plants in response to workers'
complaints of work-related upper and lower respiratory
symptoms and asthma (41). In addition, an epidemiologic
study found decrements in lung function associated with
more than 10 years of high exposure to paper dust (42).
The strengths of the present study include reliable lung
function data, a large sample size that allowed for unbiased
estimation of the effect of the confounding factors, and
varied industrial and job exposures. Application of the
sampling weights resulted in odds ratios that were similar to
those obtained from unweighted analyses. The limitations of
the study are mainly due to the study design and include the
following: 1) the NHANES III survey was not designed to be
representative of US employment patterns, thus potentially
obscuring the importance of some high-risk work; 2)
industry and occupation categories were not always homog-
enous with respect to exposure to respiratory hazards; 3) lack
of detailed industry/occupation codes undoubtedly resulted
in some misclassification of exposure; and 4) the cross-
sectional study design has limitations for the ascertainment
of correct causal exposure.
In conclusion, the results of the present study show that
employment in specific industries and occupations is associ-
ated with an increased risk of developing COPD, and they
add further evidence that occupational exposures contribute
significantly to the overall burden of COPD. Part of this
burden may be due to the synergistic effect of tobacco
smoking and occupational exposure (43). More research is
needed to confirm that the newly identified industries and
occupations are associated with an increased risk of COPD
and to identify causal risk factors. To maximize the impact
of this research on reducing the prevalence of COPD in the
US population, etiologic research and preventive interven-
tions should focus on industries that have high odds ratios
and a large number of cases attributable to workplace
exposure.
