This study estimates the acute effect of exposure to a local
homicide on the cognitive performance of children across a com-
munity. Data are from a sample of children age 5­17 y in the Project
on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. The effect of
local homicides on vocabulary and reading assessments is identi-
fied by exploiting exogenous variation in the relative timing of
homicides and interview assessments among children in the same
neighborhood but assessed at different times. Among African-
Americans, the strongest results show that exposure to a homicide
in the block group that occurs less than a week before the assess-
ment reduces performance on vocabulary and reading assessments
by between 0.5 and 0.66 SD, respectively. Main results are rep-
licated using a second independent dataset from Chicago. Findings
suggest the need for broader recognition of the impact that ex-
treme acts of violence have on children across a neighborhood, re-
gardless of whether the violence is witnessed directly.
cognitive function | neighborhoods | violence | acute stress
Despite the national decline in homicides that has occurred
since the mid-1990s, homicide remains among the leading
causes of death among 15- to 24-y-olds nationally and is the top
cause of death among African-Americans in this age range (1).
These figures reflect the toll that homicide takes in terms of lives
lost, but they may understate the total impact of extreme violence
among children living in violent areas. Research examining direct
exposure to serious violence among youth suggests possible
effects on a range of developmental outcomes, although the
estimates are subject to problems of selection bias (2­5). This
study takes a broader view and examines the impact of extreme
violence as felt across a community, regardless of whether the
violence is witnessed directly. Specifically, the analysis estimates
the acute effect of local homicides on children's cognitive per-
formance, as measured by two assessments of vocabulary and
reading skills.
Incidents of extreme violence may affect children's performance
on cognitive assessments through various physiological, emotional,
or social responses related to stress, fear, or trauma. Research has
shown that youth directly or indirectly exposed to different forms
of community violence show elevated rates of symptoms related to
acute or posttraumatic stress disorder, including disrupted sleep,
anxiety, reduced awareness, and difficulty with concentration, all
of which may act as mechanisms leading to impaired performance
on cognitive assessments (6­9). The broader literature on stress
and cognitive function provides further support for the hypothe-
sized relationship between exposure to environmental stress and
cognitive performance (10­12). Findings from experimental studies
of humans are nuanced, but one consistent result is that highly el-
evated levels of stress or stress hormones impair cognitive perfor-
mance, particularly on tasks related to declarative memory (10, 11).
The general finding linking experimentally induced stress with im-
paired cognitive performance is consistent with a large literature
from animal models (10­13).
Extending the findings from these experimental studies to as-
sess the impact of violent events in children's environments is
challenging, however, because the experience of living near a ho-
micide cannot be reproduced in an experimental setting, and
homicides are not distributed randomly across neighborhoods in
a city. Estimates of "homicide effects" will be biased if unobserved
factors jointly predict selection into a violent environment and the
outcome of interest. To address the problem of selection bias,
a method is developed that exploits exogenous variation in the
relative timing of homicides and interview assessments among
children living within the same neighborhood.
Data on all reported homicides occurring in Chicago from 1994
through 2002 are merged with data from a survey of children and
families in Chicago conducted over the same timeframe, the
Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods
(PHDCN) (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/PHDCN) (14). Children
in the PHDCN sample who were clustered within the same
neighborhoods were assessed over an extended period covering
several months or longer. Using neighborhood fixed effects
specifications, the impact of a recent, local homicide is identified
by comparing scores on cognitive assessments among children
living within the same neighborhood who were assessed at dif-
ferent times: Some were assessed in the days following a local
homicide, whereas others were assessed months later or earlier.
The central assumption underlying the method is that, within
a given neighborhood, the timing of homicides in relation to the
timing of interview assessments produces exogenous variation in
the recency of local homicides; this exogenous variation serves as
the basis for causal inference.
Results
From 1994 through 2002, 6,041 homicides in Chicago were
reported by the Chicago Police Department and successfully
geocoded. Exposure to local homicides varies substantially by
race/ethnicity. Among African-Americans in the PHDCN sam-
ples, 54 assessments were conducted within 4 d after a homicide
in the census tract (2.1%), 92 were within 7 d (3.5%), 131 were
within 10 d (5.0%), 170 were within 14 d (6.5%), and 325 were
within 28 d (12.5%). Exposure to local homicides is much less
common among Hispanics and is extremely rare among whites.
The effect of a local homicide is estimated separately for
African-Americans and Hispanics so that all comparisons are
made within race/ethnic groups; whites and members of other race
and ethnic groups are excluded because results for these groups
would be based on only a handful of individuals in the sample who
contribute to the estimate. Estimates represent the effect of a
local (within the neighborhood) homicide occurring within dif-
ferent time intervals preceding the assessment, including tract by
survey wave fixed effects, and controlling for calendar year and
month of year (analysis details are given in Materials and Methods).

Neighborhoods are operationalized using three successively larger
nested boundaries: block groups, census tracts, and neighborhood
clusters (15, 16). (Definitions of each geographic boundary are
given in SI Appendix.)
Two assessments are available in the PHDCN to measure vo-
cabulary and reading skills; both assessments have been validated
and used extensively in previous research using the PHDCN to
capture key verbal/language skills important for social interaction
and academic achievement (17­19). The first assessment is a
vocabulary subtest from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
Children-Revised (WISC-R) in which scores are normed to re-
flect performance relative to a national sample of children of the
same age, with the normalized scale designed to have a mean of
10 and SD of 3 (20). The second assessment is a letter and word
reading subtest from the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT3).
Scores again are normed to reflect performance relative to a na-
tional sample of children of the same age; the normalized scale is
designed to have a mean of 100 and SD of 15 (21). The assessments
capture dimensions of cognitive skill that are strongly predictive
of later educational attainment, labor market success, health, and
criminal behavior (22­26).
Figs. 1 and 2 show a series of point estimates representing the
effect of exposure to a homicide within African-American child-
ren's neighborhoods, using three successively larger geographic
levels of analysis: block groups, census tracts, and neighborhood
clusters. Estimates for Hispanics are null in almost every specifi-
cation and thus are not shown but are available in SI Appendix.
From left to right, the figures show the effect of a homicide that
occurred within 4 d, 7 d, 10 d, 14 d, and 28 d before the cog-
nitive assessment.
Fig. 1 displays results using the WISC-R vocabulary score as the
dependent variable, and Fig. 2 displays results using the WRAT3
reading score as the dependent variable. From Fig. 1, exposure to
a homicide in the block group that occurred within 4 d before the
assessment reduces African-Americans' WISC-R scores by 1.40
points (P < 0.10), an effect that is marginally significant at con-
ventional levels. The estimated effect of exposure to a homicide
within a week before the assessment is more precise and indicates
that a homicide in the child's block group within a week before the
WISC-R assessment reduces a child's score by 1.52 points, slightly
more than 0.5 SD (P < 0.01). Estimated effects of exposure to
homicides in the block group occurring more than a week before
the assessment are nonsignificant. The effects of exposure to
a homicide in the child's census tract or neighborhood cluster that
occurred within 4 d before the assessment are negative and sta-
tistically significant, but each estimate is substantially smaller in
magnitude than the effect of a homicide occurring in the block
group. As the duration of time between the homicide and the as-
sessment increases, the estimated effects of homicides in the census
tract and the neighborhood cluster are weak and nonsignificant.
Results shown in Fig. 2 indicate that living in a block group
where a homicide occurred within 4 d before the assessment
reduces African-Americans' scores on the WRAT3 by 9.72 points
(P < 0.10), an effect size that is substantively large (0.65 SD) but
only marginally significant because of imprecision in the estimate.
The estimated effect of exposure to a homicide in the block group
within a week before the assessment also is substantively large but

is estimated imprecisely and is not significant. As the time win-
dow between the homicide and the assessment extends beyond
a week, the effect size again becomes smaller, a pattern that is
present for both assessments and at all levels of analysis. Homi-
cides occurring in the child's census tract or neighborhood cluster
have nonsignificant effects on WRAT3 scores regardless of the
duration of time between the homicide and the assessment.
Alternative estimates based on kernel-weighted local linear
regressions suggest a temporal pattern to the results in which the
effect of local homicides is most severe in the period immediately
following the homicide and diminishes in a linear manner as the
period between the homicide and the assessment widens. Roughly
9 d after the homicide the effect size approaches zero and fluc-
tuates around zero thereafter. (Details are given in SI Appendix.)
Although the analytic approach is designed to be robust to se-
lection bias by making comparisons within neighborhoods, the
assumption of exogenous variation in the recency of local homi-
cides could be violated if there is systematic heterogeneity among
African-American children living within the same neighborhood
who were assessed at different times. Additional analysis pre-
sented in SI Appendix assesses whether there are observable dif-
ferences in caregiver or child characteristics among children living
in the same neighborhood who were or were not exposed to local
homicides in the period before the assessment. Results reveal no
systematic heterogeneity in any key caregiver characteristics or in
children's self-reported violent activity or school performance/
engagement.
Results presented to this point are based on a relatively small
number of children who were assessed within a short period
following a local homicide in their neighborhood; with this lim-
itation in mind, replications of the analysis are essential before
drawing strong conclusions. This section describes results from
a replication using data from the Chicago sample of the Three
City Study of Welfare, Children and Families (http://www.icpsr.
umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/04701) (27, 28), a longitudi-
nal study of low-income families living in three cities (Boston,
Chicago, and San Antonio) that began in 1997. The Three City
Study includes an independent sample from the same city as the
PHDCN sample--Chicago--and the timing of the survey over-
laps with the timing of the PHDCN, reducing the possibility that
period effects may obscure comparisons of results from the two
surveys. The Three City Study conducted assessments of cogni-
tive skills based on a letter-word identification subtest and an
applied problems subtest from the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-
Educational Battery-Revised (29). The availability of both as-
sessments allows for a test of whether the pattern of results is
uniquetoverbal/readingskillsortospecific featuresoftheWISC-R
or WRAT3 assessments used in the PHDCN. The primary draw-
back of the Three City Study Chicago sample is the small sample
size and, as a result, the imprecision of estimates. Results displayed
below are based on 180 African-Americans in the sample.
Figs. 3 and 4 display results from specifications that replicate
those presented in Figs. 1 and 2, using the Woodcock-Johnson as-
sessments as dependent variables and the Three City Study Chicago
sample. The two measures of cognitive skills are regressed on an
indicator for whether the child was assessed within a given time
frame relative to a local homicide in the census tract of residence,
including neighborhood fixed effects and calendar year and month
of year fixed effects. Separate models are estimated for African-
Americans and Hispanics, and whites and members of other race/
ethnic groups are excluded. Similar to the PHDCN, estimated
effects are null for Hispanics and are not shown in the figures.
Results for African-Americans displayed in Figs. 3 and 4 repli-
cate the pattern of strong negative effects of local homicides oc-
curring in close proximity to the assessment, although estimates are
imprecise and the patterns are not identical to those found in the
PHDCN. Fig. 3 indicates that exposure to a homicide in the child's
block grouphasnegativeeffects on letter-word scores,althoughthe
confidence intervals are wide, and only the effect of a homicide
occurring within a week before the assessment is marginally sig-
nificant.§ Estimated effects of homicides within the census tract are
much stronger. Exposure to a homicide in the child's census tract
within 4 d before the assessment reduces scores on the letter-word
subtest by 15.10 points, or 1 full SD (P < 0.10), and exposure to
a homicide within a week before the assessment reduces scores by
13.61 points (P < 0.05). As the window of time between the ho-
micide and the assessment expands beyond a week, the effect sizes
are smaller but remain significant at conventional levels.
Fig. 4 shows negative, nonsignificant effects of homicides oc-
curring within the block group on applied problems scores. At
the level of the census tract, exposure to a local homicide oc-
curring within 4 d before the applied problems subtest reduces

spectively, among African-Americans in the Three City Study Chicago sample. Coefficient values are shown for all block group estimates and for significant

estimates are based on 348 assessments among 180 respondents. *P < 0.10; **P < 0.05.
To maximize precision of the estimates, neighborhood fixed effects are used instead of
neighborhood by survey wave fixed effects, which are used in the analysis based on the
PHDCN. Identification in the neighborhood fixed effects approach is based on variation
in exposure to local homicides among children living within the same neighborhood
(block group, census tract, or neighborhood cluster), regardless of the survey wave in
which the interview was conducted. Allowing for comparisons across survey waves im-
proves the precision of estimates and is less problematic in the Three City Study because
the first and second waves of the survey were conducted over a very short time span,
ranging only from 1999 to 2001. Results are substantively the same using neighborhood
by survey wave fixed effects. Additional details of the analysis and the Three City Study
dataset are available in SI Appendix.
§The anomalous positive effect on applied problem scores of homicides within the block
group occurring within 14 d before the assessment (Fig. 4) is driven by two outlying cases
who scored roughly 4 SD above the mean on the applied problems subtest and were
assessed 14 d after a local homicide in the block group. When these two cases are removed
from the sample, the pattern of results resembles that found for other specifications.

applied problems scores by 14.10 points (P < 0.01), and the effect
size remains large and statistically significant for homicides oc-
curring in the census tract within 10 d before the assessment.
Although estimates based on the Three City Study Chicago
sample are less precise than estimates based on the PHDCN,
results from kernel-weighted local linear regressions reproduce
the temporal pattern found in the PHDCN (SI Appendix). At
each level of analysis, the effect of local homicides is most severe
when the homicide occurred in close proximity to the assess-
ment, and the effect declines in a linear pattern as the time
between the homicide and the assessment widens.
Discussion
Evidence from two independent samples of children in Chicago
shows that exposure to a local homicide within a short period
preceding a cognitive assessment reduces performance sub-
stantially, a finding that is present among African-Americans but
not Hispanics. The magnitude of the effect varies depending on
the sample, the assessment, the proximity of the homicide to the
child's residence, and the length of time that passes between the
homicide and the assessment. In the PHDCN, exposure to a ho-
micide within the block group that occurs within a week before the
WISC-R vocabulary assessment reduces scores by roughly 0.5 SD,
and exposure to a homicide within the block group that occurs
within 4 d before the assessment reduces WRAT3 reading scores
by 0.66 SD. In the Three City Study Chicago sample, exposure to
a homicide within the census tract that occurs within a week be-
fore the assessment reduces Woodcock-Johnson letter-word
scores and applied problems scores by 0.66 to 1 SD, although
these estimates have wide confidence intervals.
In each case, the estimated effects of recent local homicides are
substantial, suggesting that local homicides have a nontrivial
acute effect on African-American children's performance on
cognitive tests that fades as the window of time between the ho-
micide and the assessment widens. In the PHDCN sample, the
effect of a homicide appears strongest when the homicide occurs
close to the child's home, within the block group of residence, and
is smaller for homicides that occur within the census tract or the
neighborhood cluster. In the Three City Study, the geographic
pattern is less clear because the estimates at the block group level
are extremely imprecise; the strongest effects are found at the
census tract level, and there are no effects at the level of the
neighborhood cluster.
Collectively, the results provide evidence that local violence
weighs on the minds of children as they approach cognitive
assessments, but the mechanisms producing lower levels of cog-
nitive performance are not testable with the available data. The
pattern of findings is consistent with the literature on acute stress
disorder, which is defined as a response to a threatening event that
induces fear, helplessness, or horror. Among other symptoms are
reduced awareness and difficulties with concentration for a period
lasting at least 2 d and up to 1 mo after the stressor (30­34). Al-
though this definition aligns fairly closely with the patterns pre-
sented, the absence of effects for Hispanics complicates any simple
interpretation of the likely mechanisms. It is not clear, for instance,
why local homicides would generate acute stress among African-
Americans and not among Hispanics. One possible explanation is
that homicides may be less salient or less threatening in the lives of
Hispanics because the victims of homicides are frequently African-
American.¶ By contrast, homicide victims in African-Americans'
neighborhoods are almost always of the same race. Unfortunately
the data do not have sufficient power to detect interactions by race/
ethnicity of victim, and the racial/ethnic difference in the effect of
local homicides remains an unexplained finding that warrants
additional research.
With this caveat in mind, this study provides evidence for
acute effects of community violence that is robust to selection
bias, a central problem faced by the observational literature on
exposure to violence and community disadvantage more broadly
(35­39). The identification strategy developed here addresses
the selection bias problem by exploiting variation in the recency
of local homicides arising from the relative timing of interview
assessments and local homicides among children in families that
have selected the same neighborhood. Importantly, the method
is designed to capture only the acute impact of homicides and by
design does not provide any information on permanent impacts
on cognitive development. Still, the analysis of acute effects may
have implications for understanding long-range inequality if one
considers the spatial concentration of homicides and the preva-
lence of violent events within specific communities. As an ex-
ample, if the findings from this analysis are simplified and one
assumes that homicides within the census tract impair cognitive
functioning for roughly 1 wk, calculations based on the PHDCN
sample indicate that about 15% of African-American sample
members spend at least 1 mo out of a year functioning at a low
level purely because of local homicides. According to the same
calculations, African-American sample members living in the
city's most violent neighborhoods spend at least one quarter of
the year, or roughly 1 wk out of every month, functioning at a low
level because of local homicides.
Thus, although the analysis is limited to the identification of
acute effects, these calculations indicate that in the most violent
communities youth frequently may navigate daily life within

the school or home environment while functioning at less-than-
optimal levels. An additional implication of the results is that the
impact of violence is not limited to those victimized or those who
directly witness an act of violence but is felt by children across
a community who live in close proximity to extreme violent
events. This finding has implications for efforts to mitigate the
harmful consequences of exposure to violence. Whereas reviews
of the literature have led to calls for interventions designed to
provide treatment or counseling for children directly exposed to
violence within the home, school, or neighborhood environment
(4), the current findings suggest the need for a broader recog-
nition of the impact that violence can have on children living in
the area, regardless of whether they witness violence directly or
are personally victimized.
Materials and Methods
The PHDCN is a longitudinal study of families with children that in three
interview waves has collected extensive information on child development,
including assessments of vocabulary/reading skills among adolescents. The
sample is representative of families with children living in Chicago in 1995.
Families were followed wherever they moved over a period ranging from late
1994 through 2002, and residential addresses were geocoded at all three
interview waves, allowing researchers to link families to their residential
location through restricted-use files. The second source of data is a geocoded
file identifying the location where the homicide occurred and the date of
every homicide reported by the Chicago Police Department from 1994
through 2002. Neighborhoods are operationalized using three successively
larger nested boundaries: block groups, census tracts, and neighborhood
clusters (definitions of each geographic boundary are provided in SI Ap-
pendix) (15, 16). Cognitive assessments in the PHDCN were given to children
in age cohorts 6, 9, 12, and 15 y at waves 1 and 2 of the survey and to
children in age cohorts 3, 6, 9, and 12 y at wave 3 of the survey. Sample
members from age cohort 18 y of the PHDCN are excluded in all waves, and
sample members from age cohort 15 y are excluded in wave 3 because they
received a different assessment designed for adults. Children in the final
sample range in age from 5 to 17 y.
By using the merged data file children's vocabulary and reading scores are
regressed on an indicator for a recent homicide in the census tract, with tract
by survey wave fixed effects,k as in Eq. 1:

where Yi
is child i's score on one of two assessments of cognitive skills, Wave
and Tract represent census tract by survey wave indicators, Year and Month
represent calendar year and month of year indicators, and Homicide is an
indicator taking on a value of unity if the child's assessment was conducted
within a given period after a homicide in the census tract;  represents the
effect of a local and recent homicide on the child's cognitive assessment
score. To adjust SE for possible clustering of error terms within individuals
assessed more than once, all results reported in the main text use the Huber/
White sandwich estimator.
The inclusion of tract by survey wave fixed effects means that the esti-
mator relies entirely on variation in the relative timing of individual
assessments and local homicides within a given census tract and within
a particular survey wave. This method drops from the analysis sample
members located in neighborhoods in which there is no variation in ex-
posure to homicides within a given survey wave. For example, in the
specification testing for effects of homicides in the census tract that occur
within 7 d before the assessment, individuals would be dropped from the
analysis if none of the sample members within the tract were assessed
within a week after a local homicide or in the unlikely case that all sample
members within the tract were assessed within a week after a local
homicide. In either case, there would be no variation in exposure to a local
homicide among sample members within the census tract. In census tracts
where some sample members were sampled within a week after a homicide
and others were not, those assessed within a week after the homicide
compose the treatment group, and those not assessed within a week after
a homicide compose the control group. Calendar year indicators are in-
cluded to control for period effects. Month of year indicators are included
to address the possibility that the time of year in which sample members are
assessed could produce a spurious association between exposure to local
homicides and cognitive performance. This spurious association might
occur because homicides are more common in the summer months, and
research shows that students score lower on standardized assessments
when school is out of session (40).
The replication analysis is conducted with the same methods using the
Chicago sample of the Three City Study of Welfare, Children, and Families. The
Three City Study collected information from a sample of low-income families
living in low-income neighborhoods, including assessments of cognitive skills
based on a lette-word identification subtest and an applied problems subtest
from the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised (29). The
sample comprises families with a focal child in one of two age ranges (as of
wave 1): age 0­4 y or age 10­14 y. The current analysis is based on focal
children in the older age range, all of whom were eligible for the Woodcock-
Johnson assessments at both wave 1 and wave 2 of the survey.
Data from the PHDCN and the Three City Study are accessible through the
Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research.
