menopausal women: Atrophy or
Vulvodynia?

Abstract
Background: Although postmenopausal vulvar pain is frequently attributed to vaginal atrophy, such symptoms may
be due to vulvodynia, a chronic vulvar pain condition. Given the limited research on vulvodynia in postmenopausal
women, the objective of this study was to provide preliminary population-based data on the associations of vaginal
symptoms, serum hormone levels and hormone use with chronic vulvar pain in a multiethnic sample of
post-menopausal women.
Methods: We used data from 371 participants at the Michigan site of the Study of Women's Health Across the
Nation (SWAN) who participated in the 13th follow-up visit. Women completed a validated screening instrument
for vulvodynia and provided information on additional vaginal symptoms as well as demographic characteristics,
and hormone use by questionnaire. Blood samples were obtained to assess hormone levels. We compared women
who screened positive for vulvodynia and women with past or short-duration vulvar pain to women without vulvar
pain, using Chi-squared and Fisher's Exact tests. Relative odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated
using multinomial logistic regression models adjusting for age, body mass index, and race/ethnicity.
Results: Current chronic vulvar pain consistent with vulvodynia was reported by 4.0 % of women, while 13.7 %
reported past but not current chronic vulvar pain or short-duration vulvar pain symptoms. One quarter of women
who reported current chronic vulvar pain did not report vaginal dryness. Women with current chronic and with
past/short duration vulvar pain symptoms were more likely to have used hormones during the preceding year
than women without vulvar pain symptoms (13.3 %, 17.6 %, 2.0 %, respectively; p < .01). Increased relative odds
of current vulvar pain symptoms were associated with each log unit decrease in serum dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate,
estradiol and testosterone levels at the previous year's visit.
Conclusion: Some women who experience chronic vulvar pain symptoms do not report vaginal dryness, and others
report continued or first onset of pain while using hormones. Vulvodynia should be considered in the differential
diagnosis of postmenopausal women presenting with vulvar pain symptoms.
Background
Although vulvar pain symptoms can occur at any time
over the life span, it is not uncommon for symptoms to
begin for the first time after menopause [1­3]. In fact,
the prevalence of chronic vulvar pain in mid-life women
has been estimated to be 8.9-38 % percent, making
chronic vulvar pain a major health concern for women
in this age group [4, 5]. However, despite recognition of
the burden of chronic vulvar pain symptoms in the mid-
life, research on vulvodynia, a chronic pain condition
characterized by pain in the vulva, has mainly focused
on premenopausal women [1, 2].
Until recently, research on postmenopausal vulvar pain
symptoms has largely focused on vaginal dryness and
vulvar atrophy, secondary to estrogen deprivation. How-
ever, evidence indicates that postmenopausal vulvar pain
may occur for other reasons as well [6­9]. Additionally,
women with atrophy do not all experience pain [7], epi-
sodes of postmenopausal vulvar pain are not all success-
fully treated using estrogen therapy [8, 9], and in a

recent study serum estradiol, estrone, and progesterone
levels of postmenopausal women were not tightly corre-
lated with vulvar pain [3]. These findings suggest that
some vulvar pain reported by postmenopausal women
may be a condition other than atrophy, such as vulvody-
nia, and present independent of estrogen-or atrophy-
related changes.
This paper evaluates chronic vulvar pain reported by
African American and white women participating in the
Michigan site of the longitudinal, multiethnic Study of
Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). Although
the sample size is limited, prospective measurements of
age at final menstrual period, symptoms of vaginal dry-
ness, and hormone therapy (HT) use, as well as serum
hormone levels obtained prior to the assessment of
current pain status, provide preliminary data on the esti-
mated prevalence of chronic vulvar pain, consistent with
vulvodynia in post-menopausal women and its associ-
ation with hormones, HT use and vaginal dryness in this
population-based sample of postmenopausal women.
Methods
This study used data from the Michigan site of SWAN,
a multiethnic prospective cohort study addressing
health-related changes in the midlife and menopausal
transition. The cohort has been described in detail previ-
ously [10]. Briefly, in 1996, each SWAN clinic site
enrolled white women and one targeted minority popu-
lation. The Michigan SWAN population, established
using a community census, was composed of women
aged 42­52 years at baseline, who were not using ex-
ogenous hormones at the time of enrollment, had an in-
tact uterus and at least one ovary and had had a
menstrual period in the three months before enrollment,
were not pregnant or lactating, and self-identified as ei-
ther white or African American. At baseline and each
follow-up visit a blood sample was collected, height and
weight measures were taken while demographic charac-
teristics, medication use, and symptoms of vaginal dry-
ness were ascertained by questionnaire. Over the next
17 years women participated in follow-up visits approxi-
mately annually. At the 13th follow-up visit in 2012, the
Michigan site added several screening instruments for
chronic pain conditions including a validated screening
instrument for vulvodynia [11].
At baseline, the Michigan SWAN cohort was com-
posed of 543 women, 60 % of whom were African
American by design. In 2012, 32 (5.9 %) women had
died and 411 (80.4 % of the non-deceased cohort) were
still active, 380 (92.5 %) of whom participated in follow-
up Visit 13. Nine women who did not answer any ques-
tions pertaining to vulvar pain were excluded, leaving
371 womeN (61.7 % African American) eligible for this
analysis. For analyses including endogenous serum
hormone levels, we evaluated hormone levels at Visit 12,
to ensure hormone levels preceded the report of vulvar
pain status at Visit 13. These analyses include 319
women as we excluded the 37 women who did not have
blood drawn and the 15 women who reported HT use at
Visit 12.
Ethics and consent
This study was approved by Health Sciences and Behav-
ioral Sciences Institutional Review Board of the University
of MichigaN (HUM00083308). Women provided in-
formed consent at baseline and each follow-up interview.
In Visit 13, Michigan participants completed a vali-
dated screening questionnaire for vulvodynia [11] that
obtained information on symptoms of vulvar pain or dis-
comfort, including date of pain onset, duration of pain,
and whether pain continues. We interpret a positive
screen in this postmenopausal population to be consist-
ent with vulvodynia but acknowledge that this screening
tool may not adequately differentiate vulvodynia from
atrophy in this postmenopausal cohort. Therefore we
use the term "chronic vulvar pain" in lieu of vulvodynia
when presenting the results.
Based on responses to the vulvodynia questionnaire,
each participant was categorized into one of three
groups: women with current chronic (lasting 3 months
or longer) vulvar pain, women who reported ever having
chronic vulvar pain in the past or reported having short-
duration (less than 3 months duration) vulvar pain
symptoms, and women reporting no current or past vul-
var pain symptoms. Current chronic vulvar pain was de-
fined by a history of vulvar pain or discomfort at the
opening to the vagina that had lasted for at least three
months and had been experienced in the preceding three
months. The past chronic vulvar pain/short-duration
vulvar pain symptom group included women who had a
history of vulvar pain lasting for at least three months
but who had not experienced pain in the preceding three
months and women with current vulvar pain lasting for
less than three months. This group represents a hetero-
geneous symptomatic group who, based on prior work
[12], are more likely than the non-symptomatic group to
develop vulvodynia, and hence we categorize them sep-
arately from the no pain group.
Age was modeled as a continuous variable. Race/ethni-
city was self-reported as either white or African Ameri-
can. Measured height and weight were used to calculate
body mass index (BMI) (weight in kilograms (kg) divided
by height in meters (m) squared). BMI was further cate-
gorized as normal weight, overweight, or obese (<25,
25- < 30, and > = 30 kg/m2). Socioeconomic status was
assessed by self-reported difficulty paying for basics (very
hard versus somewhat or not hard) and education at
baseline (high school or less versus at least some

college). Marital status was categorized as either married
or not married.
In addition to questions about vulvar pain, we asked
about other specific vulvovaginal symptoms at Visit 13
including self-reported number of days in the past
2 weeks of vaginal dryness, soreness, and irritation cate-
gorized into three duration levels (0 days, 1­5 days, or
>6 days). In addition, we created variables to reflect
whether women ever reported vaginal dryness before,
and after, the final menstrual period (FMP) or hysterec-
tomy (yes/no) based on responses at each follow-up visit.
Although women were not eligible to enroll in SWAN ff
they were using HT, women who began using HT after
enrollment remained in the study. Two HT variables
were considered: current HT use (yes/no), and ever used
HT during the study (yes/no).
At each visit, a fasting blood sample was collected,
refrigerated for 1­2 h after collection, and then centri-
fuged. Serum hormone levels of estradiol (E2), dehydro-
epiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S), follicle stimulating
hormone (FSH), sex hormone-binding globuliN (SHBG),
and testosterone (T) were determined.
All assays were performed on the ACS-180 automated
analyzer (Bayer Diagnostics Corporation, Tarrytown,
NY) at the CLASS laboratory at the University of Mich-
igan, utilizing a double-antibody chemiluminescent im-
munoassay with a solid phase anti-IgG immunoglobulin
conjugated to paramagnetic particles, anti-ligand anti-
body, and competitive ligand labeled with dimethylacri-
dinium ester (DMAE). The FSH assay is a modification
of a manual assay kit (Bayer Diagnostics) utilizing two
monoclonal antibodies directed to different regions on
the beta subunit, with a lower limit of detection (LLD)
of 1.05 mIU/mL. Inter-and intra-assay coefficients of
variation were 12.0 % and 6.0 %, respectively. The E2
assay modifies the rabbit anti-E2-6 ACS-180 immuno-
assay to increase sensitivity, with a LLD of 1.0 pg/mL
and inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation aver-
aging 10.6 % and 6.4 %, respectively. The T assay modi-
fies the rabbit polyclonal anti-T ACS-180 immunoassay,
with a LLD of 2.19 ng/dL and inter-and intra-assay coef-
ficients of variation of 10.5 % and 8.5 %, respectively.
The DHEA-S and SHBG assays were developed using
rabbit anti-DHEA-S and anti-SHBG antibodies, with
LLDs of 1.52 mcg/dL and 1.95 nM, respectively. For
DHEA-S, the inter- and intra-assay coefficient of vari-
ation were 11.3 % and 8.0 %, respectively. For SHBG, the
inter- and intra-assay coefficient of variation were 9.9 %
and 6.1 %, respectively. Duplicate E2 assays were con-
ducted, with results reported as the arithmetic mean for
each subject, with a CV of 3-12 %. All other assays were
single determinations. Hormone levels below the lower
limit of detection were assigned a random number be-
tween 0 and the lower limit of detection.
The prevalence of vulvar symptoms overall and strati-
fied by demographic characteristics were calculated and
compared using Chi-squared and Fisher's Exact tests as
appropriate. Hormone levels were log-transformed for
regression analyses. The median values of the log-
transformed E2, DHEA-S, SHBG, FSH, and T at Visit 12
were compared overall and across symptoms groups
using Kruskal-Wallis tests. Relative odds ratios (OR) and
95 % confidence intervals (CI) comparing the current
chronic vulvar pain and past/short-duration vulvar pain
groups to the no vulvar pain group were calculated using
multinomial logistic regression models appropriate for
outcomes with more than two categories [13]. These
models compare odds for reporting current chronic vul-
var pain symptoms in relation to the no pain category
and odds for reporting past/short-term vulvar pain
symptoms in relation to the no pain category. In
addition to an unadjusted model, models adjusted for
race, BMI, and age were also assessed. Analyses were
performed using SAS 9.3 (Cary, NC).
Results
At follow-up Visit 13, participants ranged in age from 56
to 68 years (median 61.3 years). Of the 371 women eli-
gible for this analysis, 15 women (4.0 %; 95 % CI: 2.5 %,
6.6 %) reported current chronic vulvar pain, 51 (13.7 %;
95 % CI: 10.6 %, 17.6 %) reported past chronic or short-
duration vulvar pain, and 305 (82.2 %; 95 % CI: 78.0 %,
85.8 %) reported no vulvar pain. Of the 15 women
reporting current chronic vulvar pain, one did not pro-
vide an age of symptom onset, four experienced symp-
tom onset before age 45, two experienced onset between
age 46 and 55, and the remaining 8 experienced onset
between ages 56 and 64 years. Five of the 15 women re-
ported first onset since their previous follow-up visit,
representing an incidence of 1.3 %.
Median age, marital status, and proportion sexually ac-
tive in the previous 6 months did not differ by chronic
vulvar pain status (Table 1). However, women with
current chronic vulvar pain were more likely to be white,
less likely to be obese, and more likely to have com-
pleted at least some college compared to women in the
other vulvar pain groups (Table 1).
Although few women reported current HT use, both
the current chronic and past/short-duration vulvar pain
groups were more likely than women with no vulvar
pain symptoms to report having used HT during the
preceding year (Table 1). Women with past/short-dur-
ation vulvar pain were more likely to have ever used HT
and more likely to have had a hysterectomy than women
in the other two groups (Table 1). Two of the 15 women
with current symptoms (13.3 %) began HT after pain on-
set but did not report remission while 3 of the 32
women with current or past chronic vulvar pain

symptoms (9.4 %) reported first onset of vulvar pain
while taking HT.
Prevalences of self-reported dryness, soreness, and/or ir-
ritation were lowest in the no vulvar pain symptoms group
and highest in the current chronic vulvar pain group
(Table 1). However, although over half of women with
current vulvar pain indicated they had "dryness" for over
6 days in the past 2 weeks, approximately a quarter
(26.7 %) of women with current vulvar pain did not report
vaginal dryness. Similarly, although reporting of "soreness"
or "irritation" was most frequent in women with current
chronic vulvar pain, over half of the women with current
chronic vulvar pain did not report soreness or irritation.
In the multinomial logistic regression models adjusted
for race, odds of having current chronic vulvar pain
symptoms were significantly elevated in white women,
current HT users, and individuals reporting dryness,
soreness, or irritation for 6 or more days in the preced-
ing 2 weeks (Table 2). Odds of past/short-duration vul-
var pain symptoms were significantly elevated in white
women, current and past HT users, women who had
had a hysterectomy, and individuals reporting vaginal ir-
ritation 1­5 days in the previous 2 weeks. Adjusting the
logistic models for age or BMI did not substantially alter
results (data not shown).
At Visit 12, median serum hormone levels of E2 and
DHEA-S tended to be lower (p = 0.06) in women who sub-
sequently reported current chronic vulvar pain symptoms
at Visit 13 compared to those who reported no vulvar
symptoms (Table 3). The unadjusted relative odds of
current chronic vulvar pain symptoms versus no vulvar
symptoms at Visit 13 were elevated with each log unit de-
crease in Visit 12 E2, DHEA-S, and T levels (Table 4).
After adjustment for age, race and BMI, the odds remained
elevated only for DHEA-S and T. FSH and SHBG levels
were not associated with chronic vulvar pain. In an ex-
ploratory analysis we evaluated longitudinal endocrine pat-
terns prior to pain onset in the five women reporting new
onset chronic pain symptoms at visit 13. From Visit 10 to
Visit 12, three of the five experienced a sharp drop in E2
levels (defined < =15 % of the Visit 10 level at Visit 12) as
did only 12 of 256 women without symptoms.
Discussion
Postmenopausal women are as likely as younger women
to report chronic vulvar pain consistent with vulvodynia
[4, 14, 15]. This study is one of the first population-
based studies to examine the association between symp-
toms of vaginal dryness, serum hormone levels, hor-
mone use and chronic vulvar pain symptoms in
postmenopausal women. We found that women with
current chronic vulvar pain symptoms often experienced
pain onset prior to menopause. Women with current
chronic pain were more likely than women without such
pain symptoms to be using HT, and some reported the
onset of vulvar pain symptoms while already taking HT.
Despite the possibility of inadequate hormonal treatment
in some cases, vulvar pain unresponsive to HT further
supports the presence of a chronic pain condition such
as vulvodynia that is likely to require alternative, non-
hormonal, treatment modalities. Notably, more than a
quarter of women who reported current chronic vulvar
pain did not report vaginal dryness, a common com-
plaint associated with vaginal atrophy. Lower average
DHEA-S, and T levels prior to ascertainment of vulvar
pain symptoms were associated with elevated odds of
subsequently reporting chronic vulvar pain, further sup-
porting that for some, hormonal levels may contribute
to symptoms experienced. These results provide add-
itional evidence that chronic vulvar pain in postmeno-
pausal women has a heterogeneous etiology and, in many
women, may not be explained by estrogen deficiency-
related atrophy alone [6, 14, 15].
In this sample of postmenopausal women, the preva-
lence and incidence of chronic vulvar pain was some-
what lower than that observed in other studies. One
previous study reported prevalences in women age 40­
65 years of 13.9 % and 8.9 % among women who had
and had not used HT, respectively [4, 5], and an inci-
dence of approximately 3.3 per 100 person-years in
women age 50 and older [16]. A second paper reported
a prevalence of vulvovaginal symptoms suggestive of at-
rophy in 38 % of women aged 45­65 [5]. The low preva-
lence of chronic vulvar pain reported in this study
reflects the large proportion of African Americans who
have been shown to be less likely than white women to
report chronic vulvar pain. Vulvodynia is more prevalent
in white women than African American women in most
[2, 4, 16], although not all studies [17]. The low preva-
lence reported here also reflects the older average age of
the study population, as previous reports have indicated
that vulvodynia prevalence and incidence decline with

age, especially if those not having sexual intercourse are
included in the analysis [4, 16].
Previous research has suggested that a drop in estro-
gen may be associated with onset of chronic vulvar pain
that will not necessarily be reversed by subsequent estro-
gen supplementation [8]. We observed that lower levels
of E2, DHEA-S, and T were associated with increased
odds of reporting current chronic vulvar pain, although
only DHEA-S and T remained significant after adjust-
ment. When we evaluated longitudinal endocrine pat-
terns prior to pain onset only in the five women
reporting new onset chronic pain symptoms at visit 13,
three of the five had experienced a prior sharp drop in
E2 levels compared to just five percent of women with
no symptoms. Although consistent with the theory that
a variable hormonal environment may contribute to
chronic vulvar pain, we observed only a small number of
new onset cases. Further study of the relationship be-
tween longitudinal endocrine patterns and risk for
chronic vulvar pain is warranted.
Lower DHEA-S levels at visit 12 were associated with
higher odds of reporting current chronic vulvar pain
symptoms, a finding that should be explored in future
studies. An association between low DHEAS and sexual
dysfunctioN (as measured by the Female Sexual Func-
tion Index) [18] and a weak association of serum andro-
gens and sexual well-being in women with premature
ovarian failure have been reported [19]. However, a
mechanism to explain a direct relationship between
DHEAS and vulvar symptoms is unclear. The topical ap-
plication of DHEA to the vagina in women with severe
atrophy has been reported to improve all domains of
sexual function, including pain with sexual activity, in
controlled clinical trials [20­22], potentially due to local
conversion to androgens and estrogens. Future studies
are needed to confirm and further assess these findings.
This study adds to the literature indicating that post-
menopausal vulvar pain may be caused by factors other
than vulvovaginal atrophy [6­9, 14, 15]. Hormone use did
not always prevent symptom onset and was not associated
with symptom remission in all women. However, as the
vulvodynia screening instrument was administered at only
Visit 13, timing of vulvar pain onset was ascertained by
retrospective report. Also, information on details of HT
such as dose, route of administration, indication and dur-
ation of use was limited or unavailable; thus, we are not
able to assess adequacy of treatment for presumed estro-
gen deficiency. However, those with vulvar pain symptoms
secondary to atrophy who had been adequately treated
with estrogen would not be included in the chronic vulvar
pain group­hence only those with persistent symptoms
despite hormone therapy, and those with persistent symp-
toms who have not taken HT, were included in the
chronic vulvar pain group.
This analysis was constrained by the limited sample
size, particularly the small number of women with
current vulvar pain symptoms meeting our screening
criteria. As a categorization of chronic pain requires a
minimum duration of three months and categorization
as a past case depends on participant recall, it is possible
that some participants forgot to report past episodes,
thus attenuating the findings. Nonetheless, a unique
strength of this study is the availability of longitudinal
data on HT use, serum hormone levels, and self-reports
of vaginal dryness in postmenopausal women within a
defined timeframe after the final menstrual period per-
mitting a more detailed, though preliminary, look at the
relationship between vaginal symptoms, hormone levels
and vulvar pain in a population-based, multi-ethnic sam-
ple of midlife women. Future studies might consider
evaluation of additional pain symptoms such as dyspar-
eunia in relation to reporting of chronic vulvar pain.
Conclusion
This preliminary but rich longitudinal population-based
study adds to the growing literature suggesting that

vulvar atrophy may not be the sole cause of postmeno-
pausal vulvar pain. Postmenopausal women may be ex-
periencing new onset, exacerbated and/or long-term
chronic vulvar pain consistent with a diagnosis of vulvo-
dynia. Health care providers should consider and evaluate
for vulvodynia when treating postmenopausal women
with chronic vulvar pain, especially those women who fail
to respond to HT. The best tool for distinguishing if
chronic vulvar pain consistent with both atrophy and vul-
vodynia will respond to HT is to give a trial of HT,
followed by alternative vulvodynia treatments in those not
responding. Future research should focus on the diagnosis
and treatment of women who do not respond to this
intervention.
