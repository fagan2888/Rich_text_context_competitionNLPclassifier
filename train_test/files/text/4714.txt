Article
Everyday experience thus fails to reveal how the universe really
works, and that's why a hundred years after Einstein, almost no
one, not even professional physicists, feels relativity in their
bones. This isn't surprising; one is hard pressed to find the
survival advantage offered by a solid grasp of relativity.
Newton's flawed conceptions of absolute space and absolute
time work wonderfully well at the slow speeds and moderate
gravity we encounter in daily life, so our senses are under no
evolutionary pressure to develop relativistic acumen.
--Brian Greene (2004, p. 77).
The intimately woven bond between space and time--a
relationship so entrenched that it is referred to by physi-
cists as a single entity called spacetime--has been an
accepted scientific fact for generations of scientists.
Repeated tests have confirmed empirically that time is not
the static entity that Newton imagined it to be; rather, in
line with the theory of relativity, motion and gravity not
only affect space but also simultaneously affect time. Time
in reality slows up and slows down for each observer based
on their movement through spatial dimensions in highly
predictable ways (see, for example, Greene, 2004; Penrose,
2010; Shankar, 2013).
Yet, in spite of this long-accepted fact in physics, the
notion of spacetime has received curiously little attention
from psychologists studying time perception. We suspect
that this is very likely because most academics share promi-
nent physicist Brian Greene's (2004) assessment--illus-
trated in the above quote--of the relationship between
actual spacetime and our perception of spacetime. That
assessment could be summarized as follows: Who needs it?
After all, if the added predictive "everyday" value of space-
time perception is so small that it conveys no survival
advantage at all, then why would we have ever developed a
mechanism to account for it? And if we would not have ever
developed such a mechanism, why bother thinking about the
relationship between our psychological functioning and
spacetime in the first place?

Psychological Spacetime: Implications of
Relativity Theory for Time Perception
Lucian Gideon Conway III1, Meredith A. Repke1,
and Shannon C. Houck2
Abstract
It has been an accepted scientific fact in physics for almost 100 years that time speeds up and slows down for an observer
based on factors--such as motion and gravity--that affect space. Yet this fact, drawn from the theory of relativity, has not
been widely integrated into the study of the psychology of time. The present article helps to fill in this gap between physics
and psychology by reviewing evidence concerning what a psychological spacetime processor--one that accounted for the
theory of relativity's empirically validated predictions of the compensatory relationship between time and space--would
look like. This model of the spacetime processor suggests that humans should have a psychological mechanism for slowing
time down as motion speeds up, a prediction that already has widespread research support. We also discuss several novel
hypotheses directly suggested by the spacetime model and a set of related speculations that emerge when considering
spacetime (some of which have already received empirical support). Finally, we compare and contrast three very different
potential reasons why we might have developed a spacetime processor in the first place. We conclude that the spacetime
model shows promise for organizing existing data on time perception and generating novel hypotheses for researchers to
pursue. Considering how humans might process spacetime helps reduce the existing gap between our understanding of
physics and our understanding of human psychology.

Why Should Psychology Researchers
Care About Psychological Spacetime?
The sentiment is understandable. Yet we nonetheless believe
that there are at least two separate reasons to care about psy-
chological spacetime. First, available evidence suggests that
the psychology of time and the psychology of space are in
reality intimately bound up; and yet this fact is rarely tied to
the physical relationship between time and space. For exam-
ple, positron emission tomography (PET) and functional
magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) studies suggest that
time perception and motion perception systems have quite a
bit of direct overlap in shared biological space in the brain
(Coull, Frith, Buchel, & Nobre, 2000; Coull & Nobre, 1998;
Doherty, Rao, Mesulam, & Nobre, 2005; Griffin & Nobre,
2005; Janssen & Shadlen, 2005; for a review, see Eagleman
et al., 2005). Similar work reveals that localized hemispheric
deficits in space perceptions show corresponding deficits in
time perception, further suggesting that "representations of
space and time share neural underpinnings" (Saj, Fuhrman, &
Vuilleumier, 2014, p. 207; for related evidence, see Mauk &
Buonomano, 2004). Although this overlap does not mean we
have a spacetime processor in line with relativity theory, it is
at least consistent with the notion that space and time are per-
haps more intricately bound up in human psychology than a
Newtonian processor might expect. Thus, it is worth more
fully conceptually and empirically exploring the nature of this
overlap, and the actual operation of space and time in physics
is one potential guiding model to aid our understanding.
Second, we have at times in history underestimated the
human capacity for sensing and assimilating information
from the environment. For example, 100 years ago, few
would have predicted the profound ability of the human
psyche to sense, interpret, and assimilate information pre-
sented below the level of conscious awareness, or the degree
that human psychology occurs beyond our explicit knowl-
edge or consent. Yet, today, such unconscious and implicit
effects are accepted scientific fact (see, for example, Bargh
& Chartrand, 1999; Conway, 2004; Hsieh & Colas, 2012;
Kouider, de Gardelle, Dehaene, Dupoux, & Pallier, 2010;
Proulx & Heine, 2008). For example, research demonstrates
that one can implicitly prime stereotypical schemas and alter
subsequent behavior in ways consistent with the stereo-
type--such as slowing down persons' walking speed by
priming words related to "old"--without persons being con-
sciously aware that the process is happening (see Bargh &
Chartrand, 1999).
Although our species has only recently begun to articulate
the concepts of spacetime, it seems nearly certain that physi-
cal spacetime has existed in its present integrative form
throughout human history. As such, any evolutionary pro-
cesses1 acting upon our species would have acted in the con-
stant presence of such spacetime as a certain reality, and thus
it is perhaps premature to dismiss out of hand the possibility
that we do have some mechanisms that aid us in the
integrative perception of spacetime. And, as we shall see
below, some research suggests that we may indeed have
spacetime-like mechanisms for perceiving the intimate, rela-
tivistic relation between space and time.
The implications of understanding the psychological
overlap between space and time are vast. To the degree that
humans do possess spacetime-like processors, understanding
those mechanisms could contribute a great deal to our funda-
mental understanding of how humans process time. The
largely untested set of hypotheses generated by the new pro-
posed model could importantly alter our understanding of
the psychology of time.
This is no small matter: The psychological processing of
time has multiple practical implications for human emotion,
lifesatisfaction,andmentalhealth(e.g.,Carstensen,Isaacowitz,
& Charles, 1999; Conway, 2004; Droit-Volet, Fayolle, & Gil,
2011; Droit-Volet & Meck, 2007; Flaherty, 1991; Fredrickson,
Mancuso, Branigan, & Tugade, 2000; Gil & Droit-Volet, 2009,
2012; Hawkins, French, Crawford, & Enzle, 1988; Rowe,
Hirsh, & Anderson, 2007; Zimbardo & Boyd, 2008). If how
people process time is altered by space and motion (as we dis-
cuss below), then interventions that use time as a mechanism
for improving life quality could be potentially improved by
including considerations of space and motion.
The Present Article
The purpose of the present article is to address this gap
between physical spacetime and the psychology of time. Our
primary method to accomplish this goal is to consider what a
spacetime processor--one that processed spacetime in line
with relativity theory--would look like if humans possessed
it. As we discuss below, our model does not (necessarily)
predict that physical spacetime and psychological spacetime
directly overlap in one-to-one correspondence. It rather sug-
gests larger directional principles concerning how we would
process the relationship between space and time.
To illustrate our model, we discuss a set of predictions
that can be made, when considering physical spacetime,
about how people might perceive time and space. This
includes a substantial research literature supporting one of
the key predictions from our newly conceptualized psycho-
logical spacetime model, as well as additional novel hypoth-
eses that have yet to be tested. We then discuss a set of related
speculations that emerge when considering spacetime.
Finally, we compare and contrast three very different poten-
tial reasons why we might have developed a spacetime pro-
cessor in the first place.
The Backstory Sketch of a Spacetime
Processor
The theory of relativity suggests that movements through
time and space are compensatory, so that movement through
space affects movement through time and vice versa. This
Conway et al. 3
means that if we perceived spacetime in line with relativity,
we would have mechanisms that would in some way corre-
spond to this interaction between time and space. It further
suggests that all things that "bend" space or alter motion--
such as gravity--would also affect time perception. Below,
we discuss what we might expect to find in a human proces-
sor if, in fact, there were mechanisms for processing space-
time in this manner. Before doing so, however, it is necessary
to first discuss, writ large, how human processes typically
interface with the real world.
Human Processing Involves Exaggerated
Comparative Perceptions
No human processing mechanism interfaces with physical
reality by producing a one-to-one correspondence with that
reality. We do not "copy" reality into our mind; it is always
a reconstructive process. For example, from the moment
light photons hit the eye, the visual system is reconstruct-
ing, altering, transmuting, and adapting the reality "out
there" into an image "in here" (see, for example, Weiten,
2013). As a result, it would be unrealistic to expect that a
human psychological mechanism would exist that might
produce an exact replication of spacetime in the human
mind. Rather, if we look across known human processing
mechanisms, what we see instead are a series of exaggera-
tions and perceptual heuristics that roughly correspond,
most of the time, to something "out there." So, for example,
our mechanisms for distinguishing objects in our environ-
ment involve a series of processes that essentially exagger-
ate differences between features in our visual world: We
have systems that visually enhance edges, systems that
overemphasize clustering of like stimuli, and systems that
finish apparently unfinished familiar objects (see, for
example, Weiten, 2013).
These perceptions do not exist in a vacuum and, as a
result, are often as responsive to relative changes on a par-
ticular variable as to the absolute level of that variable (see
Cialdini, 2001). A common example involves judgments of
temperature--A 70-degree room will feel hot if someone
enters it from a 40-degree environment, but the same
70-degree room will feel cold if a person enters it from a
100-degree environment. This simple example illustrates
that we often process changes in the general direction (e.g.,
hot to cold, cold to hot) of variables as much as we process
the absolute level of those variables.
As a result of this general tendency to have exaggerated
comparative perceptual mechanisms, what we might expect
to find in terms of our psychological interface with space-
time is not a one-to-one measurement of spacetime, but
rather a set of similarly exaggerated mechanisms for perceiv-
ing the general direction of the relationship between the
variables involved in spacetime alterations. This looser per-
spective suggests a set of hypotheses (described in detail
later in this article) about how we ought to perceive the
general relationship between space and time as a corollary to
their actual physical relationship.
Human Processing Involves Perceptions of
Observable Markers
Time perception is highly malleable (see, for example,
Conway, 2004; Droit-Volet et al., 2011; Droit-Volet & Meck,
2007; Flaherty, 1991). For such malleable systems, human
processing most typically involves perceptions of observable
markers of objective reality and not the underlying reality
itself. For example, evolutionary psychology theories of
mate selection emphasize that we do not have a direct line to
the "fertility" of a particular mate; rather, there are markers
that themselves are correlated with fertility (e.g., markers of
age, beauty, health), and it is those markers that we use (e.g.,
Buss & Schmitt, 2011). Similarly, there are markers of
whether or not someone is related to us (Park, Schaller, &
Van Vugt, 2008), or whether or not someone has a disease
that might harm us (Park, Schaller, & Crandall, 2007). These
markers are not direct lines to kinship or disease; they are
rather observable indicators that are correlated with those
factors.
When we are thinking of how we might process space-
time, it is likely that we have mechanisms that note observ-
able markers in our world that alter time perception, much in
the same way we might assume that someone with a sym-
metrical face is more likely to be fertile. This would mean
that, as in the case of fertility markers, the markers will
sometimes not correspond to reality in a given instance.
Much evolutionary psychology suggests that we have psy-
chological modules that operate in this manner (e.g., Buss &
Schmitt, 2011).
As a result, it is not necessarily the case that we have to be
experiencing spacetime alterations ourselves to show the
effect of the markers. As an example, consider that if we
have a heuristic that suggests "darkness = exaggerate danger-
related traits," we do not need to feel "in danger" for the
heuristic to cause the expected outcome (e.g., Schaller, Park,
& Mueller, 2003). Similarly, many of the hypotheses sug-
gested by spacetime may not require people to actually expe-
rience spacetime alterations; but rather, people may have
corresponding implicit mechanisms to alter their time per-
ceptions based on observable markers that are generally
associated with spacetime changes.
What Would a Spacetime Processor
Look Like?
Having painted a sketch in broad brushstrokes of how we
might expect a psychological spacetime processor to inter-
face with the real world, we now turn our attention to the
features a spacetime processor should possess. To do so, we
lay out some specific psychological factors we would expect
a time perception processor to operate on if it corresponded
4 SAGE Open
in some way to the known physical relation of space and
time. Each factor suggests some specific hypotheses relevant
to human time perception. In perhaps the most salient
hypothesis, data already exist that are consistent with the
spacetime model; for the other hypotheses, no tests that we
know of have been performed.
A Spacetime Processor Would Account for the
Compensatory Interplay of Motion and Time:
Evidence for the Spacetime Model
One of the most eye-opening predictions of relativity theory
is that motion through space and motion through time are
compensatory: The more we travel through space, the less
we travel through time (see, for example, Greene, 2004;
Hawking, 1996, 2001; Hawking & Mlodinow, 2010; Kaku,
2008; Krauss, 2007; Penrose, 2010; Shankar, 2013). At the
speeds we normally travel at, this effect on time is not explic-
itly noticeable; but it is occurring just the same. So if a space-
time processor existed, it would have some kind of
exaggerated mechanism for accounting for this interaction.
This suggests a straightforward hypothesis for the spacetime
processor: That perceptions of motion ought to make time
psychologically slow down. Operationally, this means that
motion ought to increase estimates of duration (e.g., Cohen,
Hansel, & Sylvester, 1953; Goldreich, 2007; Helson & King,
1931), because if time appears to move slower to Observer A
than Observer B, Observer A will report that more time has
passed in the same interval.
When we go to the literature on time perception, this is--
with a couple of exceptions (Chen, Pizzolato, & Cesari, 2013;
Orgs, Bestmann, Schuur, & Haggard, 2011)--exactly what sci-
entists have found. Despite the fact that there is a widespread
assumption that our time perception mechanisms are funda-
mentally Newtonian, numerous studies across multiple para-
digms have shown that as people perceive motion, time slows
down for them (Abe, 1935; Brehmer, 1970; Brown, 1995;
Cohen et al., 1953, 1955; Helson, & King, 1931; Jones &
Huang, 1982; Kanai & Watanabe, 2006; Kroger-Costa,
Machado, & Santos, 2013; Lebensfeld & Wapner, 1968;
Masuda, Kimura, Dan, & Wada, 2011; Matthews, 2011; Mauk
& Buonomano, 2004; Newman & Lee, 1972; Price-Williams,
1954; Sarrazin, Giraudo, Pailhous, & Bootsma, 2004; Tayama,
2006; Tse, Intrilligator, Rivest, & Cavanagh, 2004; Yamamoto
& Miura, 2012). We next provide a summary of this evidence.
Indeed, a long history of research on the well-established
kappa effect is consistent with this time-stretching effect of
perceived motion (Abe, 1935; Cohen et al., 1953, 1955;
Jones & Huang, 1982; Lebensfeld & Wapner, 1968; Masuda
et al., 2011; Newman & Lee, 1972; Price-Williams, 1954;
Sarrazin et al., 2004). The kappa effect occurs when partici-
pants overestimate the amount of time occurring between
two repeated stimuli as the physical space between the stim-
uli becomes larger. The kappa effect thus involves the depen-
dence of temporal judgments on the spatial context; the
effect is often directly tied to the phenomenological percep-
tion of velocity or motion (see, for example, Jones & Huang,
1982; Masuda et al., 2011), and--consistent with relativity
theory--it becomes larger as stimuli move more quickly
(Masuda et al., 2011).
Additional studies from different paradigms have investi-
gated how the presence of action for a stimulus affects time
duration estimates. For example, Yamamoto and Miura
(2012) found that after viewing an image of a person run-
ning, participants perceived time to be lengthened--that is,
they perceived the presentation duration to be longer--com-
pared with participants who viewed an image devoid of
action. Brown (1995) also found that stimulus motion length-
ened perceived duration, and further showed that higher
velocity stimuli led to increasingly lengthened estimates of
perceived time, relative to lower velocity stimuli.
Other work paints a similar picture. Tayama (2006) con-
cluded that increased velocity of motion led to increased esti-
mates of time elapsed. Matthews (2011) investigated the role
of velocity by testing whether the time-lengthening effect
was equal for objects in constant motion, accelerating
objects, and decelerating objects. Viewing objects in con-
stant motion led to the greatest degree of perceived time
lengthening. Furthermore, Matthews found that when par-
ticipants viewed an accelerating object, followed by a sta-
tionary object, the result was a perceived lengthening of the
duration of the stationary object.
Other studies have explored the effect of the perception of
motion by putting participants themselves into motion.
Consistent with the spacetime model, Kroger-Costa et al.
(2013) found that when a participant is in motion, perception
of stimuli duration is lengthened. Decades earlier, Brehmer
(1970) found that participants riding in faster moving cars
made longer estimates of duration than those in slower mov-
ing cars.
In summary, although there exists a small amount of evi-
dence that might be construed as inconsistent with the space-
time model (Chen et al., 2013; Orgs et al., 2011),2 an
overwhelming array of evidence from multiple paradigms is
consistent with a model suggesting that humans have mecha-
nisms for processing spacetime in the general direction of
relativity theory's predictions.
Novel Predictions of the Spacetime Processor
All good theoretical perspectives are first and foremost gen-
erative (see, for example, Conway & Schaller, 2002). Thus,
although it is interesting to note that one of the spacetime
model's key predictions has received empirical validation--
and it gives us a good reason to continue pursuing the
model--it nonetheless is important to use the model to make
future predictions that help us generate new knowledge.
Below, we illustrate three additional predictions made by the
spacetime model that provide the potential to generate novel
findings.
Conway et al. 5
Novel Prediction 1:A spacetime processor would account for the
magnification of time­motion compensation across large dis-
tances.Although much evidence supports that we have a
mechanism that in some way accounts for relativity theory's
prediction of the compensatory nature of motion and time, a
related (and, in physics, an equally clear and demonstrable)
prediction from relativity theory has received no attention at
all in the time perception literature. Brian Greene (2004)
illustrated by showing that if two observers were 10 billion
light years apart, relativity theory shows that Observer A
moving a paltry 10 miles an hour toward Observer B would
cause Observer A to move 150 years into the future of
Observer B! Thus, relativity theory directly shows that the
effect of relative motion on time perception ought to be
greater the farther the two objects in question are from each
other. Although, like all the other spacetime effects observed
here, this magnification effect of distance in space is negli-
gible at the small distances we typically travel in, a space-
time processor might nonetheless have an exaggerated
mechanism to track it.
This suggests a series of testable hypotheses. For example,
one could run typical experiments showing the motion­time
perception link while systematically varying the distances
between perceiver and perceived object. Furthermore, one
can run experiments that systematically vary the distance (or
perceived distance) between two objects and their relative
motion to each other--Based on the spacetime model, we
would predict that as perceived distance increased, the
strength of the motion­time perception relationship would
increase as well.
Novel Prediction 2:A spacetime processor would account for the
compensatory interplay of gravity and time.Relativity shows
that because gravity bends space, it also bends time. As a
result, for objects that are closer to large masses (where grav-
itational pull would be more immediately present), time
moves slower than for objects farther from those masses
(see, for example, Hawking, 1996, 2001). A straightforward
prediction made by relativity theory, then, is that time moves
slower on the earth at low altitudes than at high altitudes,
because low altitudes experience more "pull" from the
earth's gravity. And in fact, numerous studies using high-
powered, precise atomic clocks have confirmed this effect--
One such study showed that time ran faster for clocks that
differed in altitude by only 33 inches (Chou, Hume, Rosen-
band, & Wineland, 2010). Indeed, the effect is important
enough that if satellite global positioning system (GPS) did
not account for it, their predictions would sometimes be off
by several miles (Hawking, 1996; Hawking & Mlodinow,
2010).
If we have mechanisms for processing time in line with
relativity theory, two related psychological hypotheses are
suggested by the effect of gravity on time (neither of which
has received direct empirical testing to our knowledge).
First, and more local to our typical experience, is this: We
should perceive time as moving more quickly as we perceive
increases in altitude. Objects farther from the earth are higher
up, and relativity theory suggests (and empirical observa-
tions confirm) that time should move faster at higher alti-
tudes. Thus, as a person perceives increases in altitude, time
should psychologically speed up for the spacetime processor.
Second, and more generally, we should perceive time as
moving more slowly when we perceive that a target is close
to a mass that is large on a cosmic scale. Thus, if we perceive
that a target is very close to a mass large enough to affect
gravity substantially (e.g., an astronaut is close to the sun vs.
far away), our spacetime model predicts that time would be
dilated for that target.
Novel Prediction 3: A spacetime processor would recognize that
other people's experiences of time are different from its own.The
thoughtful observer may have noticed that, up to this point,
we have conflated the effects of observing alterations that
would affect other people's conception of time and observing
alterations that would affect our own conception of time.
That is in part because perceptual heuristics and primes often
function this way--They often function like direct links tap-
ping into perception mechanisms, and those links sometimes
work independent of context. For example, a lot of work on
priming shows that subtle exposure to words along specified
dimensions directly alters subsequent behavior, even when it
makes no conceptual sense based on the context, such as
when people walk more slowly after they are exposed to
words related to being "old" (for a summary, see Bargh &
Chartrand, 1999). In the same way, it is entirely possible that
our spacetime mechanisms might be "primed" by images
even in circumstances where they would not normally make
direct sense, and as such might alter our time perception in
the same way that priming "old" alters walking speed. Thus,
even if we see other people in motion, or other people close
to large gravitational objects, we might show effects of
spacetime processing.
On the contrary, one of the more important suggestions of
relativity theory is that each observer's sense of time will
differ from every other observer's sense, based on the prin-
ciples outlined above. Although spacetime might potentially
suggest a number of more speculative hypotheses in this
regard--an issue we return to in a later section--one of the
more straightforward things we might expect from a space-
time processor is that it would account for the fact that other
people's senses of time might not always be the same as our
own. For example, if (a) we have a mechanism for recogniz-
ing that objects at different altitudes move through time at
different speeds, and (b) Person A recognizes that she is cur-
rently at a different altitude from Person B, it follows that (c)
Person A would recognize that she and Person B are cur-
rently moving through time at different speeds.
General evidence suggests that we adjust for the fact that
time "slows down" and "speeds up" across contexts (e.g.,
Carstensen et al., 1999; Conway, 2004; Droit-Volet et al.,
6 SAGE Open
2011; Droit-Volet & Meck, 2007; Flaherty, 1991; Gil &
Droit-Volet, 2009, 2012) and that we are aware of time dis-
tortions (e.g., Lamotte, Izaute, Droit-Volet, 2012). For exam-
ple, participants in one study (Conway, 2004) showed time
estimates that converged with those of other group members
if they worked with them on a face-to-face task, demonstrat-
ing that time perceptions are implicitly malleable at a funda-
mental level. As a result of this malleability, it is reasonable
to assume that we are aware that time would subjectively
move differently for different people based on circumstances.
However, none of that evidence to our knowledge tests the
hypothesis that we directly account for spacetime effects
when considering other people's movement through time.
One simple way to test this would be to show pictures/videos
of other persons in various conditions where spacetime
effects are manipulated, and then ask people to either (a) esti-
mate how much time they think has passed for themselves, or
(b) estimate how much time do they think has passed for that
person in the picture/video. To the degree that spacetime pro-
cessing effects are larger for participants' time estimates for
the other people who (in those conditions) would actually be
experiencing the effects, this would suggest that we have a
mechanism to directly account for the differential effects of
spacetime on different targets.
Thus, although we might expect effects of perceived
motion and gravity to some degree regardless of context and
actor, the spacetime model would expect those effects to be
larger when explicitly considering the person(s) to whom the
effects should directly affect.
Additional Implications of Relativity:
Speculations Raised by Considering
Spacetime
We have thus far discussed hypotheses that follow in a
straightforward fashion from the theory of relativity as classi-
cally understood. This generally involves taking empirically
validated or theoretically understood findings from the last
100 years of physics--things on which almost all physicists
would agree--and extrapolating in a direct way what we
might expect a spacetime processor to look like in the human
species. While of course, as we have emphasized, no psycho-
logical interface with reality is perfectly straightforward,
these hypotheses nonetheless mostly follow fairly directly
from consensually agreed-upon implications of classical
physics. Few physicists would disagree that time slows down
as motion speeds up, that the time dilation effect of motion is
larger as objects are farther apart, that time slows down near
objects with large mass, and that different observers often
travel through time at different speeds. The psychological
spacetime implications we have drawn thus far correspond
closely to those known facts drawn from relativity theory.
However, sometimes a theoretical perspective can be use-
ful not only for the direct hypotheses it offers but also for the
speculations and questions it inspires. For example, an evo-
lutionary perspective of cultural transmission has not only
generated specific hypotheses, it has also inspired research-
ers to consider questions about how culture grows that might
not have even been asked otherwise (see, for example,
Schaller, Conway, & Tanchuk, 2002). Here, we briefly lay
out three potential areas of research that are inspired by a
consideration of spacetime. These do not directly follow
from classic relativity theory, yet they emerge largely because
of a consideration of the issues involved with the theory. If
relativity theory is a pebble dropped in a pond, these specula-
tions are the outward psychological ripples that emerge from
that pebble.
A Spacetime Processor May Account for the
Malleability of Time's Arrow: Precognition
Although we generally perceive that time only moves in one
direction (from the "past" to the "future"), classic relativity
theory shows that there is no reason it cannot move both for-
ward and backward. Unlike in Newtonian physics, relativity
theory suggests that space and time are one whole self-con-
tained entity, lumped together as a kind of "frozen river."
This means that, in principle, spacetime implies that time
could be bidirectional. In the words of Sheehan (2006), both
relativity theory and quantum physics "formally and equally
admit time-forward and time-reversed solutions . . . it seems
untenable to assert that time-reverse causation (retrocausa-
tion) cannot occur, even though it temporarily runs counter
to the macroscopic arrow of time" (p. vii).
From a psychological point of view, this asymmetry
potentially opens the door for things in the future to affect
things in the present. As such, if we had a spacetime proces-
sor that accounted for this fact, it would be psychologically
possible that things in the future might influence what is psy-
chologically happening right now, in the same way that
things in the past influence what is happening right now. This
would suggest that the existence of what are sometimes
called "psi" phenomena may actually be rooted in both phys-
ical and psychological science.
And indeed, recent evidence for precognition offers some
reason to believe that this idea of relativity theory might hold
some weight. Precognition refers to an anticipatory cogni-
tive or affective awareness, conscious or unconscious, of
future events. Operationally, it is the influence of future stim-
uli on one's present psychological processes. Recent experi-
mental research has demonstrated precognitive effects
relevant to reinforcement, priming, habituation, and mem-
ory, such that effects operate "backwards in time" (Bem,
2011; Bem, Tressoldi, Rabeyron, & Duggan, 2014; Tressoldi,
Lance, & Radin, 2010). For example, Bem (2011), in a pack-
age of nine studies published in the Journal of Personality
and Social Psychology, found that participants were more
likely to respond in ways that were later reinforced, when
Conway et al. 7
both the random assignment of reinforcement and the rein-
forcement itself occurred after the responses in question
were already made. In other words, Bem showed that what is
about to happen to participants influenced their responses
before it happened to them. This surprising finding suggests
that current responses were influenced by future reinforce-
ment of those responses, reinforcement for which partici-
pants would ostensibly be unaware because it had not
"happened" yet. In other, similar studies, participants' judg-
ments were influenced by primes that occurred after their
judgments were reported, and participants performed better
on a recall test for words that were rehearsed after the recall
test was completed.
These findings have been met with a fair amount of criti-
cal skepticism, in part because results have been inconsis-
tently replicable (e.g., see Galak, LeBoeuf, Nelson, Leif, &
Simmons, 2012), and more frequently due to both a lack of
theoretical explanation and a limited understanding of the
potential underlying mechanism(s) of precognitive effects
(Bem, 2011). Although we also share a skeptical view in part
for these same reasons, it is worth noting that data from a
recent meta-analysis of 90 experiments attempting to repli-
cate precognitive effects--using either exact or modified
methods outlined in Bem (2011)--provide support overall
for the existence of precognition (Bem et al., 2014; for a
review of other meta-analytic evidence, see Tressoldi et al.,
2010).
Although neither relativity theory nor modern quantum
physics directly predicts the specific mechanisms associated
with existing precognition effects, classic spacetime theory
at the very least offers a theoretical starting point whereby
the future might psychologically affect the present. As Bem
et al. (2014) discussed, physicists accept that time is both
symmetric and asymmetric; it may be that precognition and
physics coincide in ways we do not yet understand. As such,
precognition fits within the larger framework of relativity
theory by suggesting that the direction of time is somewhat
malleable at least some of the time.
A Spacetime Processor May Have Time Closely
Linked to Entropy
Of course, although relativity theory allows for the possibil-
ity of temporal causality to be reversed, this fact raises a bit
of a psychological puzzle: Why do we explicitly perceive
time moving in only one direction (called "time's arrow")?
This puzzle only emerges because of relativity's conception
of spacetime; in a commonsense Newtonian framework, we
expect time to only move in one direction. Relativity theory
thus creates the puzzle of time's arrow.
So what does modern physics say about the question of
time's arrow? If time can be bidirectional, why do we per-
ceive it to move in only one direction? The most common
assumption of modern physics is that this emerges because
time and entropy are closely linked. Brian Greene (2004)
summed this up:
[T]he only convincing framework we found for explaining
time's arrow was that the early universe had extremely high
order, that is extremely low entropy, which set the stage for a
future in which entropy got ever larger. (p. 314)
This quote illustrates a commonly accepted physical fact
about spacetime: That one the most fundamental aspects of
our experience of time--namely, that it only moves in one
direction--is intricately bound to entropy (see also Hawking,
1996; Penrose, 2010). Time's arrow moves from low entropy
to high entropy: If we see a picture of a whole egg and then a
picture of the same egg smashed to bits on the floor, we
assume that the high-entropy smashed egg came after the
low-entropy whole egg.
Although this tie seems fundamental, no research to our
knowledge has directly explored this entropy­time percep-
tion connection. A consideration of this relationship suggests
that, if we have some mechanism that is sensitive to the
entropy­time relationship, our time perception might be dra-
matically affected by "reversing" entropy as it is presented in
linear time. So by playing video clips that go from high
entropy to low entropy (instead of the reverse)--for exam-
ple, if one played a clip of billiard balls all "re-assembling"
into their typical beginning state on the pool table, rather
than the balls moving from that state to becoming more scat-
tered--one might expect that our time perception mecha-
nisms would not function in their normal way. In particular,
this could mean that that time slows down because we asso-
ciate high entropy with the "end" state and, if it is instead at
the beginning, are more likely to infer that time must be
moving more slowly.
A Spacetime Processor May Have Shared Time
Perception Mechanisms
We earlier outlined a straightforward prediction of the space-
time model pertaining to others' time perception mecha-
nisms--namely, that a spacetime processor would account
for the fact that other persons' time clocks are different from
ours in ways conforming to classical relativity theory.
However, it is worth noting that, to the degree that we do
account for this, it may also have other implications for
human psychology. Here, we speculate briefly on what those
may be.
Humans are inherently social beings. We have a funda-
mental desire to belong; we do not want to be permanently
alone or outcast; we live by being together (see, for example,
Baumeister & Leary, 1995; Conway, Houck, & Gornick,
2014). As a result, it is likely the case that, although we may
implicitly account for the fact that other people's time moves
differently from ours, we do not want to be on a different
8 SAGE Open
time continuum than they are. The thought that we are not
moving "together" on such a fundamentally basic dimension
as time may feel undesirable. This suggests a set of related
hypotheses.
One hypothesis is that we may have a mechanism for
mentally "synchronizing" our perceptions of time with oth-
ers, so that we feel like we are, in fact, on the same time
plane as they are. And indeed, some evidence suggests that
we do have just such an implicit mechanism. In one study
(Conway, 2004), participants worked on a task either side-
by-side (no interaction) or face-to-face (such that they inter-
acted with others). Participants did not talk about time in any
session, yet face-to-face participants showed a tendency to
converge in their perceptions of time's passage, so that their
perceptions of time became more like those of their fellow
group members (an effect that did not occur in the side-by-
side control conditions and was not accounted for by partici-
pants' mood). This research suggests that people seem to
have an independent mechanism to implicitly "share" the
time perceptions of others they interact with, even when they
never talk about that perception directly. This and other find-
ings at the cultural level that suggest cultures have a shared
sense of "pace of life" (Conway, Ryder, Tweed, & Sokol,
2001; Levine, 1997) fit in with a spacetime perspective--If,
in fact, we do implicitly recognize that others have different
time clocks than we do, we may have a compensatory mech-
anism to reestablish that we belong with them, in the same
way that our implicit existential fear of death leads us to have
compensatory motivational "buffers" (e.g., Rosenblatt et al.,
1989).
A second, related set of hypotheses involves the potential
psychological unease caused by feeling one is separate from
others on the time dimension. In particular, showing others in
situations where they would be experiencing different time
speeds than the target according to relativity theory (e.g.,
seeing others in higher altitudes than we are or in a motion
state that we are not currently experiencing) may cause us to
exhibit signs of wanting to "reconnect" with the people
around us as a compensatory mechanism. This may involve
a heightened effect size for reestablishing shared time (either
implicitly or by explicit efforts), or more general efforts to
"fit in" or feel like one belongs.
Where Would a Spacetime Processing
Mechanism Come From?
So far, we have discussed what a potential mechanism for
processing spacetime might look like if humans had such a
mechanism. We have shown that, in addition to there being
reason to believe that space and time are intimately bound in
biological substrate in the human brain, there is further
already substantial evidence for one of the key predictions of
the psychological spacetime model. In addition, there is at
least some evidence for two of the speculative hypotheses
drawn from the spacetime model.
However, to this point we have spoken loosely of the
spacetime processor without consideration of where or how
we might have acquired it. Below, we explore three separate
reasons why we might process temporal information in a
manner consistent with relativity theory: direct adaptations,
analogical overlap, and cultural learning.
As Direct Adaptations
It is possible that psychological mechanisms evolved as
direct adaptations to spacetime itself. But is this a legitimate
possibility? Although, on the surface, we agree with Brian
Greene's opening assessment that there is no necessary sur-
vival benefit to perceiving spacetime effects, there are none-
theless good reasons for being skeptical of arguments based
on our capacity to perceive the survival value of a psycho-
logical mechanism in the distant past (see, for example,
Conway, 1999; Conway & Schaller, 2002). We do not fully
know or understand the context in which humans emerged,
and the relationship of genetics to survival is immensely
complex; as a result, it might be premature to assume that a
set of mechanisms to more completely assess the nature of
spacetime would have conveyed no survival value to its
holders.
Equally as importantly, no evolutionary theory suggests
that only traits are related to survival last--Many of our
existing traits appear to be either "spandrels" or "noise" that
serve no necessary survival function (see, for example, Buss,
Haselton, Shackelford, Bleske, & Wakefield, 1998; Conway,
1999; Conway & Schaller, 2002). A common example is our
bone color, which is likely just an offshoot (a "spandrel") of
other factors relevant to bone density and structure that affect
survival--In other words, bone color itself is simply irrele-
vant to survival (see, for example, Buss et al., 1998). Many
of our traits are doubtless like that, and it is possible that we
might have developed a mechanism for perceiving spacetime
that conveyed no survival value, but it survived as a trait
because it did not inhibit gene survival.
Relatedly, and more importantly, is the fact that non-
Newtonian spacetime effects would seem on the surface to
be so small that they would appear to be outside of the
human capacity to perceive. As an analog, humans do not
appear to have the capacity to see most ultraviolet radiation
or to hear sound waves beyond 50,000 Hz. It is perhaps
therefore useless to talk about the "interface" of our percep-
tion mechanisms with those physical phenomena, because
we do not seem to have them at all. So given that the effects
of spacetime beyond Newtonian physics would be negligi-
ble (often measured in fractions of a nanosecond), it seems
unlikely at first blush that we would perceive them at all.
The distance between the proposed "exaggerated" mecha-
nisms for human psychology and the reality of spacetime
effects in physics seems too great. It is thus a plausible
hypothesis that we simply do not have a fine-grained enough
temporal mechanism for detecting the effects of spacetime
Conway et al. 9
at really small units of time, and the psychological space-
time effects that exist occur for different reasons (we explore
two other possibilities below).
However, it is also worth noting that a glance at the his-
tory of research on time perception suggests a pattern of
demonstrating that we can perceive time in progressively
smaller and smaller units. Based on what we currently know
about temporal-visual-related systems, we can detect stimuli
at least on scales of a few dozen milliseconds (Clifford,
Holcombe, & Pearson, 2004; Holcombe & Cavanagh, 2001;
see Eagleman et al., 2005, for a review; see also Eagleman,
2010; Sadeghi, Pariyadath, Apte, Eagleman, & Cook, 2011).
Although this is nowhere near the speeds necessary to detect
spacetime fluctuations in our current environment beyond
Newtonian levels, as our ability to measure the human mind
increases, scientists are discovering faster and faster process-
ing and perception mechanisms. Given the fact that to our
knowledge, no concerted scientific effort has been made to
discover if such fine-grained levels of spacetime perception
are possible, it may be premature to assume that such super-
speedy processing mechanisms do not exist; rather, it is pos-
sible that we simply have not yet detected them.
As a Metaphorical Analog
Of course, we too feel the same thing that Brian Greene
(2004) and others have felt--that it seems unlikely that we
have any direct psychological adaptations to spacetime.
However, even if that turned out to be true, there are still
reasons to believe that we may have perceptual mechanisms
that would roughly correspond to relativity theory's predic-
tions of the relation between space and time. Even when a
specific model does not directly apply in perfect correspon-
dence to the observed phenomenon, it can still be beneficial
as a rough metaphor (see, for example, Fredrickson, 2013).
As such, the consideration of spacetime might in that case
still serve as a useful metaphorical analog for how humans
process time perception information.
We are not the first to make this suggestion: Others have
noted that relativity theory may serve as a useful loose meta-
phor for understanding the relation of time and motion per-
ception (e.g., Goldreich, 2007; Helson & King, 1931; see
Jones & Huang, 1982). Goldreich, for example, uses the rel-
ativity-inspired name time dilation to describe the stretching
of time during motion--The name is explicitly chosen
because of the rough conceptual overlap with relativity the-
ory. However, although these examples highlight that there is
clearly empirical reason to believe in the overlap between
physical spacetime and psychological spacetime, to date
researchers have made little effort to fully explore this con-
ceptual overlap and what it means, or to explore potentially
new hypotheses and areas of research that might be opened
up by a serious consideration of spacetime.
Generally speaking, the value of co-opting a process from
one physical or biological phenomenon to use as a metaphor
for helping explain another phenomenon has been seen
across multiple areas within psychology. So, for example,
although human neural memory networks bear little struc-
tural resemblance to traditional computers, computer-based
metaphors have led to great advances in our framing and
understanding of memory (for a summary, see Solso,
MacLin, & MacLin, 2007). Similarly, although cultural sys-
tems do not operate under the same processes and constraints
as biological evolution, nonetheless the Darwinistic evolu-
tionary metaphor has served to inspire and aid a generation
of new research ideas on how culture changes over time (see,
for example, Claidière, Scott-Phillips, & Sperber, 2014;
Conway & Schaller, 2002, 2007; Gornick, Conway, Cvasa,
& Houck, 2013; Mesoudi & Danielson, 2008; Schaller et al.,
2002).
Of course, the potential scientific value of pursuing any
analog is dependent on having reasons for suspecting that
the analog will reflect some underlying reality of the studied
phenomenon. In this case, there are at least two potential
sets of reasons why there might be overlap. The first set
involves empirical considerations: We have already dis-
cussed that space and time are clearly linked in the human
brain (see, for example, Eagleman et al., 2005) and that one
of the key direct predictions of the spacetime model has
received empirical support (e.g., Cohen et al., 1953; Jones &
Huang, 1982; Kanai & Watanabe, 2006; Kroger-Costa et al.,
2013; Masuda et al., 2011; Matthews, 2011; Mauk &
Buonomano, 2004; Sarrazin et al., 2004; Tse et al., 2004;
Yamamoto & Miura, 2012). Thus, the early returns from the
model are promising, offering a number of reasons to believe
that some of the other, as yet untested, hypotheses may be
worth pursuing.
Second is a variant of the anthropic principle. This prin-
ciple argues that the things we discover about our universe
must in some way be compatible with our conscious process-
ing mechanisms (see, for example, Hawking, 1996). So, for
example, with respect to the analogical connection between
human memory and computer memory, a view from the
anthropic principle would consider that the human mind
would not have discovered the possibility of computer stor-
age units if it bore no resemblance to the way we actually
process information. Thus, although neurons are nothing like
the central processing units (CPUs) in computers, it is per-
haps unsurprising that computer memory systems and human
memory systems bear some phenomenological overlap.
Indeed, it is likely the very reason that we made computer
memory systems the way they are--We would be highly
unlikely to invent a memory system that was wildly discrep-
ant from our own.
Similarly, the anthropic principle suggests that it is pos-
sible that we process information in a spacetime-like way for
reasons that are independent entirely of the minutiae of
spacetime itself, and yet it is that very fact that allowed us to
ultimately discover the more complicated nuances of space-
time to begin with. Although processing spacetime is not
10 SAGE Open
directly intuitively obvious to us, we nonetheless had the
capacity to uncover, observe, and understand the way time,
motion, gravity, and space all interact. Although this in no
way means that we have implicit mechanisms to process
spacetime in line with relativity theory, it does at least mean
that the ability to understand spacetime was latent within the
human species. It is therefore possible that this latent pro-
cessing ability in fact corresponds to implicit processing
mechanisms. This is not a definitive argument for the space-
time model; but it does suggest a reason why we might have
an analog spacetime mechanism even if it is not a direct
adaptation. The causal arrow for the overlap may, in a sense,
go from our spacetime-like mechanisms to our discovery of
spacetime, rather than the existence of spacetime causing us
to develop such mechanisms as direct adaptations.
As a Product of Cultural Learning
An overarching knowledge structure may exist in human
minds for multiple reasons. It may exist because it reflects
some underlying pan-cultural psychological reality, in the
way that computer memory reflects aspects of human mem-
ory (e.g., Solso et al., 2007). It may also exist because it
originates in cultural learning, the way that knowledge struc-
tures related to individualism and collectivism are largely
learned at the cultural level (e.g., Conway, Clements, &
Tweed, 2006; Conway et al., 2014; Conway et al., 2001;
Kitayama, Conway, Pietromonaco, Park, & Plaut, 2010;
Kitayama, Ishii, Imada, Takemura, & Ramaswamy, 2006).
It is thus possible that relativity theory influences time
perception because it provides a conceptual cultural frame-
work for shaping reality (e.g., Conway et al., 2001; Conway
& Schaller, 2005; Grob, Little, Wanner, & Wearing, 1996;
Kitayama et al., 2010; Levine, 1997), and this learned
framework itself has an impact on time perception. The
human mind is incredibly malleable to such cultural influ-
ences, and as such, it is possible that people learn, for
example, about the time­motion integration and compen-
sate for it. If this were the case, the discovery of relativity
itself--and subsequent adoption across cultures--would
serve as a profound cultural framework for altering the per-
ception of time.
Indeed, other researchers have suggested that time per-
ception is in part a cultural phenomenon (Conway, 2004;
Levine, 1997; Zimbardo & Boyd, 2008). Therefore, it is cer-
tainly plausible that relativity theory might overlap with time
perception because it has become an accepted part of cultural
knowledge and, as a result, influences time perception in the
same way other deeply accepted cultural folkways influence
human psychology. If true, the cultural learning approach to
the spacetime metaphor suggests the important idea that as
knowledge of relativity becomes more and more pervasive,
its spread will correspondingly affect time perception in line
with relativity theory.
Do the Potential Origins of a Spacetime Processor
Matter?
We have briefly outlined three potential origins of a space-
time processor. But if we have a spacetime processor, would
it matter why we acquired it? On the surface, it would seem
that all three explanations of why we acquired it would make
the same set of predictions.
And that is true in some large sense. However, ultimately,
as we gain more and more knowledge of how humans pro-
cess temporal information, the three different proposed ori-
gins would potentially make differing predictions. For
example, if we acquired the processor as a direct adaptation
to real spacetime selection pressures, the predictions of the
spacetime model should be more likely to continue to hold at
increasingly smaller units of time--because, in our local
pocket of the universe, those smaller increments are the units
at which spacetime alterations would actually exist.
Conversely, if the spacetime processor emerged because of a
metaphorical analog or due to cultural learning, we would be
less confident that it would continue to hold at incredibly
small levels of temporal analysis. Instead, we might expect
that analogs or cultural learning would serve to guide time
perception in a general way, only at the kinds of larger units
for which we typically make such judgments at a phenome-
nological level. Thus, evidence that we show spacetime
alterations at very small units of analysis would not defini-
tively rule out the analogical or cultural learning origins, but
would weigh more heavily in favor of a direct adaptation.
Another potentially important factor on which the models
make competing predictions involves cross-cultural replica-
bility. If the spacetime processor has a cultural learning ori-
gin, one would expect that the level of knowledge a person or
culture had of relativity theory would directly correspond to
the predicted time perception effects outlined here. If it
proved to be true that the effects outlined here held only for
groups of persons with a strong knowledge of relativity, then
it would seem increasingly unlikely that the spacetime pro-
cessor had a direct adaptation or metaphorical analog origin.
Rather, that would make a stronger case for a cultural learn-
ing origin.
Consider, for example, that the reported effects of time­
motion compensation were mostly performed in societies
where there likely exists at least a cursory knowledge of the
theory of relativity. Although we strongly doubt that most of
the participants in these studies were aware of the specific
predictions related to the studies in question, it is nonetheless
possible that what those studies reflect is not a universal
mechanism for accounting for motion­time perception inte-
gration, but rather cultural learning of the theory of relativity.
If, however, such effects are found to be more or less univer-
sal across cultures and independent of the knowledge of rela-
tivity theory, this suggests that the spacetime-like effects
emerging from this conceptual analysis have some deeper
Conway et al. 11
basis that is more fundamental to the human species (whether
of adaptive or analogical origins).
At this point, we do not have enough information to
clearly distinguish between these various possible reasons
that we might see conceptual and empirical overlap between
physical spacetime and psychological spacetime. Like Brian
Greene and others, we view a direct adaptation for spacetime
processing as fairly unlikely, and thus would expect either
the metaphorical analog or cultural learning explanations to
be closer to the truth. However, our primary purpose in this
article is not to argue for any one potential origin. Rather, it
is to point out that there are multiple valid reasons why the
overlap between physical spacetime and psychological
spacetime may exist. As such, this suggests that it may be
worth more fully exploring the psychological spacetime
model as an explanatory mechanism for studying time
perception.
Concluding Thoughts
I had a sneaking suspicion that time was not constant, but I guess
I could never prove it. I suppose it didn't really matter. I even
had a theory that time didn't go in straight line at all. I knew I
was no Albert Einstein, but I had the sneaking suspicion that
everything that had happened, was happening, or would happen
was really happening all the time. There was no past, present,
and future. Everything was going on all at once and forever.
(Mark A. Roeder)
Our altered understanding of spacetime was perhaps the
most important scientific advance of the last century. And
yet, in spite of this, its potential implications for human psy-
chology are largely not well understood. The guiding
assumption seems to be that we are implicit Newtonians
(e.g., Greene, 2004; see also Eagleman, 2004; Jones &
Huang, 1982); and because we do not likely have mecha-
nisms to perceive spacetime in a manner consistent with the
complicated fashion that it actually exists, we can safely pro-
ceed in ignoring psychological spacetime in our study of
time perception.
That guiding assumption may end up being right; but
existing evidence suggests that it may be at least partially
wrong. After all, although we may not--to use Brian
Greene's metaphor that we opened this article with--"feel
relativity in our bones," we nonetheless have the capacity to
understand it at some level. Thus, popular author Mark A.
Roeder's "sneaking suspicion that time was not constant"
may, after all, turn out to represent something real in human
psychology that has yet to be fully explored.
Given that time perception has incredibly important
implications for human emotion, life satisfaction, and mental
health (e.g., Carstensen et al., 1999; Conway, 2004; Droit-
Volet et al., 2011; Droit-Volet & Meck, 2007; Flaherty, 1991;
Fredrickson et al., 2000; Gil & Droit-Volet, 2009, 2012;
Hawkins et al., 1988; Rowe et al., 2007; Zimbardo & Boyd,
2008), it is vital that we understand it as well as we can. With
that goal in mind, the present article at the very least suggests
the potential usefulness of considering psychological space-
time as a theoretical and conceptual device. It seems certain
that (a) time and space share a lot of biological overlap in the
brain, (b) we do at least in some way account for the relation-
ship of motion to time in a manner consistent with relativity
theory, (c) some speculative hypotheses consistent with the
spacetime model have received support, and (d) there are
additional conceptual reasons to think that relationship might
apply across numerous other areas of time perception. Thus,
more fully considering the overlap between physical space-
time and psychological spacetime might prove to bear fruit
in our quest to better understand time perception.

Notes
1. The present article discusses possible evolutionary processes
from the lens of evolutionary psychology, but it does not nec-
essarily assume a direct evolved adaptive mechanism. We
return to this issue later in the article.
2. The Chen, Pizzolato, and Cesari (2013) study involved elite
athletes rating time intervals following viewing action ver-
sus nonaction pictures. Viewing action pictures compressed
(rather than dilated) time. However, this study did not involve
the perception of actual (only implied) motion and was with
a very select population. The Orgs, Bestmann, Schuur, and
Haggard (2011) study involved apparent motion based on
the timing of pictures of postures in different positions, and
they found that increased perceived movement in that sce-
nario compressed time perception. Even if one accepts both
studies as direct evidence (and it is unclear whether the Chen
et al. study is directly related), most real effects generally have
counterexamples, and the overwhelming balance of evidence
is in support of the time dilation hypothesis derived from the
proposed model.

Author Biographies
Lucian Gideon Conway, III received his Ph.D. from the University
of British Columbia in 2001 and is currently a Full Professor of
Psychology at the University of Montana. His primary research inter-
ests revolve around (1) how shared cultural beliefs ­ including those
related to time perception ­ emerge, persist, and have influence, and
(2) the causes of complex (as opposed to simple) thinking and the
subsequent consequences on decision-making in political and social
arenas. He is the author of over 50 articles, commentaries, and book
chapters in these areas, and his work has been featured in major media
outlets such as the Washington Post, USA Today, and BBC Radio.
Meredith A. Repke is an Experimental Psychology Ph.D. candi-
date at the University of Montana. Her research focuses on political
communication and attitudes/behaviors related to the natural envi-
ronment and wellbeing.
Shannon C. Houck is a faculty member at Syracuse University.
She researches social and moral decision-making, dynamics of
peace and conflict, and the causes and consequences of complex
(versus simple) thinking.
