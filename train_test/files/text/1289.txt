Obesity is an important public health problem in the United States. Because of its potential effects on gastric leptin
homeostasis, Helicobacter pylori may play a role in regulating body weight. The authors' aim in this study was to
examine the association between H. pylori colonization and overweight status. Nonpregnant participants in the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­1994) aged 20 years who had had H. pylori testing
performed and body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2) measured were studied. Overweight was defined as
abody mass indexgreater thanor equalto 25. On thebasis of serologic results, the participants were categorized into
three H. pylori status groups: H. pylori-positive and cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA)-positive (H. pyloriþcagAþ),
H. pylori-positive and cagA-negative (H. pyloriþcagAÿ), and H. pylori-negative (H. pyloriÿ). Of the 7,003 subjects
with complete body mass index and H. pylori data, 2,634 (weighted percentage, 22.9%) were H. pyloriþcagAþ,
1,385 (15.1%) were H. pyloriþcagAÿ, and 2,984 (62.0%) were H. pyloriÿ. The adjusted odds of being overweight
were 1.17 (95% confidence interval: 0.98, 1.39; p ¼ 0.075) for the H. pyloriþcagAþ group and 0.99 (95% confidence
interval: 0.80, 1.22; p ¼ 0.92) for the H. pyloriþcagAÿ group in comparison with H. pyloriÿ subjects. Serum leptin
levels did not differ significantly between the three H. pylori groups. In this US population-based study, there was
no significant association between H. pylori colonization, cagAþ strains of H. pylori, and being overweight.

Obesity is a significant and growing public health prob-
lem in the United States (1). More than 60 percent of the US
adult population is considered either overweight or obese (2),
and nearly 300,000 deaths annually are attributable to obe-
sity (3), making it the second leading cause of preventable
death in the United States (4).
Leptin is a protein secreted by fat cells that plays a role in
the regulation of body weight through effects on food intake
(5). Serum leptin levels show a positive linear relation with
body mass index (6). Leptin is also produced by chief cells
in the human stomach, and levels are affected by Helico-
bacter pylori-associated gastritis (7, 8). H. pylori are gram-
negative bacteria that colonize the human stomach and
increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer
(9, 10). Gastric inflammation is highest with cytotoxin-
associated gene A (cagA) strains of H. pylori (11, 12). Much
evidence indicates that H. pylori is an ancient colonizer of
humans (13, 14) that is highly prevalent in developing coun-
tries but is disappearing in developed countries, including
the United States (15). This change in the microecology of
human populations may have metabolic consequences and,
in particular, could affect risk of obesity by influencing
gastric leptin production (16). We hypothesized that coloni-
zation with H. pylori, particularly cagA strains, is associated
with a decreased body mass index. Our aim in this study was
to evaluate the association between H. pylori and body mass

index using data from the Third National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES III), in which informa-
tion on H. pylori status, body mass index, and other relevant
variables was ascertained in a population-based study of
more than 7,000 persons.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
NHANES III was conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics in two phases (phase 1: 1988­1991; phase 2:
1991­1994) (17). This cross-sectional study used a complex,
highly stratified, multistage probability sample of the civil-
ian, noninstitutionalized US population. The weighted dis-
tribution of participants was similar to that of the US
population as a whole. The survey protocol was reviewed
and approved by an institutional review board at the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, and all participants
provided written informed consent.
H. pylori status was ascertained only in phase 1 of
NHANES III. There were 8,442 participants in this phase
of the study who were aged 20 years and were interviewed
and examined. Pregnant women (n ¼ 138), persons belong-
ing to the race/ethnicity category ``other'' (n ¼ 261), and
persons with equivocal H. pylori serologic results and neg-
ative cagA assays (n ¼ 78) were excluded. Of the remaining
7,965 participants, 7,003 had data on both body mass index
measurements and H. pylori testing.
Study design
The NHANES III staff conducted surveys in households,
administered questionnaires, and conducted standardized
medical examinations at mobile examination centers at a
single visit. Criteria for overweight status were established
according to published National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute guidelines (4). Body mass index was calculated as
weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2). H. pylori testing
was performed using a commercial immunoglobulin G
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Wampole Laborato-
ries, Cranbury, New Jersey). Each 96-well plate contained
the manufacturer's three cutoff controls (negative, high pos-
itive, and low positive) and three positive and two negative
controls provided by the testing laboratory. For each speci-
men, an immune status ratio was calculated by dividing the
specimen absorbance by the mean absorbance of the three
cutoff controls. Specimens were considered negative if the
immune status ratio was 0­0.90, equivocal if the immune
status ratio was 0.91­1.09, and positive if the immune status
ratio was greater than or equal to 1.10. Results were vali-
datedusingcodedreplicatesampleswiththelaboratorywork-
ers blinded as to status (17). Serologic testing for cagA was
done using a noncommercial assay developed and standard-
ized at Vanderbilt University, as previously described (12).
Fasting serum leptin levels were examined using a radio-
immunoassay with a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbits
against highly purified recombinant human leptin (Linco
Research, Inc., St. Louis, Missouri) (18). The minimum de-
tectable leptin concentration of the assay was 0.5 lg/liter,
and intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were less
than 5 percent (18).
Variable definitions
The primary outcome variable, overweight, was defined
as a body mass index greater than or equal to 25, and normal
weight was defined as a body mass index less than 25.
H. pylori serologic test results were categorized as positive,
negative, or equivocal, and cagA serologic results were cat-
egorized as positive or negative. On the basis of H. pylori
and cagA results, patients were classified into three groups:
H. pylori-positive and cagA-positive (H. pyloriþcagAþ),
H. pylori-positive and cagA-negative (H. pyloriþcagAÿ),
and H. pylori-negative (H. pyloriÿ). The H. pyloriþcagAþ
group included all persons with a positive cagA assay regard-
less of the results of the H. pylori assay, based on the utility
of the cagA antigen in detecting true-positive responses in
culture-positive persons in the face of negative or equivocal
values in the H. pylori serologic assay (19). All persons in the
H. pyloriÿ group had negative cagA assays. Demographic
variables (age, sex, race/ethnicity, country of birth, geo-
graphic location) and lifestyle variables (years of education,
economic status (poverty:income ratio 1.30, 1.31­3.49, or
3.50), cigarette smoking history, alcohol drinking history,
and activity level) were considered in these analyses.
Statistical methods
Characteristics of overweight and normal-weight partic-
ipants were compared using the F test (20) for categorical
variables and the two-sample t test for continuous variables,
with adjustments for the stratified sampling design of
NHANES III. Odds ratios and 95 percent confidence in-
tervals for the association between H. pylori and being
overweight were estimated using multivariable logistic
regression models with and without adjustment for other
covariates. The covariates included in the models were those
significantly associated with overweight in the univariate
analyses (p  0.05). The final model was developed using
a stepwise procedure with forward selection and backward
elimination, with both inclusion and exclusion criteria set at
the significance level of p  0.05.
In an additional exploratory analysis, we evaluated the
association between H. pylori and leptin levels in 2,648
participants in whom serum leptin levels had been mea-
sured. Median leptin levels were compared between the
three H. pylori groups. In addition, Spearman correlation
coefficients for correlations between body mass index and
leptin levels were calculated within each of the three
H. pylori groups.
All analyses incorporated sampling weights that adjusted
for the complex survey design of NHANES III. A two-sided
p value less than or equal to 0.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. The software packages Stata SE 8.2 (Stata
Corporation, College Station, Texas), and SAS 9.0 (SAS
Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) were used for data
analysis.

RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
Of the 7,003 participants (mean age ¼ 45.2 years;
standard deviation, 0.45) with data on both body mass
index and H. pylori status, 3,576 were male and 3,427
were female. Non-Hispanic Whites accounted for 3,285
members of the total study group; 1,785 were non-Hispanic
Blacks, and 1,933 were Mexican Americans. Of the 7,003
subjects with H. pylori data, 2,634 (weighted percentage,
22.9 percent) were classified as H. pyloriþcagAþ, 1,385
(15.1 percent) as H. pyloriþcagAÿ, and 2,984 (62.0 percent)
as H. pyloriÿ.
Overweight and normal-weight participants differed ac-
cording to all characteristics but geographic region, eco-
nomic status, and country of birth (table 1). This suggests
that many of these characteristics might have confounded
any apparent association between H. pylori status and body
mass index.
Odds ratios for the association between H. pylori
and being overweight
To evaluate the association between H. pylori and being
overweight, we estimated odds ratios for overweight status
according to H. pylori status using logistic regression models
with and without adjustment for participant characteristics
that were significantly associated with being overweight
(table 2). Although the unadjusted odds of being overweight
were significantly higher in the H. pyloriþcagAþ and
H. pyloriþcagAÿ groups than in the H. pyloriÿ group, the
association was not statistically significant after adjustment
for potentially confounding variables. In addition, we ana-
lyzed the association between H. pylori status and body mass
index using body mass index as a continuous variable; this
did not change the main findings (data not shown).
We examined pairwise correlation coefficients among all
of the covariates. While many covariates were significantly
correlated because of the large sample size, the magnitudes
of the correlation coefficients in the final model were be-
tween ­0.30 and 0.30.
Serum leptin analyses
Data on fasting serum leptin level were available for 2,648
of the 7,003 participants with complete body mass index and
H. pylori data. In unadjusted analysis, median serum leptin
levels were slightly higher in the 969 H. pyloriþcagAþ par-
ticipants (8.1 lg/liter (range, 0.5­145.0)) and the 501
H. pyloriþcagAÿ participants (8.1 lg/liter (range, 0.8­
94.6)) than in the 1,178 H. pyloriÿ participants (7.3 lg/liter
(range, 0.7­67.9)). However, the coefficients for correlations
between body mass index and serum leptin level were sim-
ilar in all three H. pylori groups (r ¼ 0.595, r ¼ 0.539, and
r ¼ 0.511, respectively).
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine
the association between H. pylori colonization and over-
weight status, as demonstrated by increased body mass

index. While unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for over-
weight status in the H. pyloriþcagAþ group compared with
the H. pyloriÿ group were greater than 1.0, this association
was not statistically significant after adjustment for poten-
tially confounding variables. A similar relation was found
for the H. pyloriþcagAÿ group. To examine the possible
effects of H. pylori on serum leptin levels, we compared
serum leptin levels among the groups that differed with re-
gard to H. pylori status. In the unadjusted analysis, serum
leptin levels were slightly higher in the H. pyloriþcagAþ and
H. pyloriþcagAÿ groups than in the H. pyloriÿ group, but
these differences were not clinically meaningful.
Serum leptin, which is primarily synthesized by adipose
tissue, regulates food intake and body weight homeostasis
(21). Leptin is now known to be synthesized in the stomach
as well (22), and this source may also be involved in the
regulation of food intake and satiety (23). Gastric inflamma-
tion, such as that induced by H. pylori (10), alters leptin
secretion in the stomach. The change in gastric leptin level
resulting from H. pylori-induced inflammation may influ-
ence food intake and body mass index. Azuma et al. (8)
reported that eradication of H. pylori is associated with de-
creased gastric leptin levels and subsequent weight gain,
although serum leptin levels did not change. Furuta et al.
(24) found that H. pylori eradication was associated with
increases in body mass index and cholesterol and triglycer-
ide levels. Our results are consistent with those of prior stud-
ies showing that H. pylori colonization does not alter serum
leptin levels (8, 25). In addition, our findings agree with
those of several smaller studies that have found no associ-
ation between H. pylori colonization and risk of obesity
(26, 27).
One of the strengths of this study was our use of the da-
tabase from NHANES III, a large, national, cross-sectional
survey specifically developed to accurately represent the
adult population in the United States. In addition, we con-
trolled for multiple covariates that could have confounded
interpretation of the results. However, there were several
limitations of our study. Since the study was cross-sectional
and both H. pylori colonization and overweight are chronic
conditions, a specific causative relation between the two may
not necessarily be inferred. In addition, the serum samples
that were tested for the leptin assays were excess samples
that remained after the required laboratory tests for
NHANES III had been completed; thus, selection of the
samples did not follow any statistical sampling strategy.
However, statistical analyses directed towards the assess-
ment of biases that might have been introduced into the sub-
set of participants with leptin measurements were negative.
Although serum leptin level does not appear to be affected by
H. pylori colonization, other gut peptide hormones that af-
fect metabolism may play a role in the regulation of body
weight. Ghrelin has also been implicated in the control of
food intake and energy homeostasis, with effects opposite
those of leptin (28). After H. pylori eradication, plasma
ghrelin levels have been observed to increase by 75 percent
over pretreatment levels, suggesting that eradication may
contribute to increased appetite and weight gain (29). Be-
cause ghrelin levels were not measured in NHANES III, they
could not be investigated in this study.
In summary, in this large, US population-based study, we
found that there was no significant relation between H. pylori
status, cagA status, and being overweight, after adjusting for
confounding covariates. Our findings suggest that future
studies of relations involving H. pylori and alterations of
metabolism homeostasis might focus on interactions with
other gut peptide hormones in colonized persons.
