Abstract
Background: Previous studies have examined physical risk factors in relation to functional health, but less work has focused
on the protective role of psychological and social factors. We examined the individual and joint protective contribution of
control beliefs, social support and physical exercise to changes in functional health, beyond the influence of health status
and physical risk factors in middle-aged and older adults. Given that functional health typically declines throughout
adulthood, it is important to identify modifiable factors that can be implemented to maintain functioning, improve quality
of life, and reduce disability.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a national longitudinal study, Midlife in the United States (MIDUS), with
assessments in 1995­1996 and 2004­2006, and 3,626 community-residing adults, aged 32 to 84, were included in the
analyses. Functional health (Physical Functioning subscale of the SF-36) and protective factors were measured at both
occasions. While controlling for socio-demographic, health status, and physical risk factors (large waist circumference,
smoking, and alcohol or drug problems), a composite of the three protective variables (control beliefs, social support, and
physical exercise) at Time 1 was significantly related to functional health change. The more of these factors at Time 1, the
better the health maintenance over 10 years. Among middle-aged and older adults, declines in health were significantly
reduced with an increased number of protective factors.
Conclusion/Significance: Age-related declines in health were reduced among those with more protective factors up to a
decade earlier in life. Modifiable psychological, social, and physical protective factors, individually and in the aggregate, are
associated with maintenance of functional health, beyond the damaging effects of physical risk factors. The results are
encouraging for the prospect of developing interventions to promote functional health and for reducing public health
expenditures for physical disability in later life.

Introduction
Although recent trends in the United States show improvements
in functional health [1,2], increased levels of disability remain a
major public health problem [3­6], especially in later life. Those
adults with health risk factors such as being overweight [7,8],
smoking [9], and having alcohol problems [10], as well as those
with chronic health conditions [11] are more likely to have poor
functional health [12]. A number of socio-demographic variables
also are related to functional health [13] including sex [14,15],
race [16­18] and socioeconomic status (e.g., educational attain-
ment) [17,19]. Yet, there is evidence that physical limitations and
disability at all ages can be reduced with modifiable lifestyle
factors, both by avoiding risk factors [20] and engaging in health-
promoting or protective behaviors [21].
Whereas most studies have concentrated on identifying risk
factors [22] for negative outcomes such as mortality and
morbidity, another approach is to examine the effects of health-
promoting factors for maintaining good health, that is focusing on
what to do rather than what not to do. This positive approach has
been found to be more effective in behavior change for health
promotion [23]. There is increasing evidence that specific
psychological, social, and physical protective factors are associated
with better health in later life [24­27]. Among these factors,
control beliefs [28­31], social support [16,25,32,33,34,35,36,37]
and physical exercise [12,38,39,40,41,42,43] are consistently
identified as predictors of functional health. Moreover, a variety
of studies have shown that control beliefs [44], social support
[45,46] and physical exercise [47] are modifiable and thus can be
subject to interventions to reduce disability and improve functional
health.
Control beliefs involve the perception that one can influence
what happens in one's life and to what extent one's actions can
bring about desired outcomes such as good health. It includes
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 10 | e13297
beliefs or expectations about one's abilities and perceptions about
external constraints [48]. Stronger beliefs about control over
outcomes are associated with better reported health, fewer and less
severe symptoms, faster recovery from illness, and higher
functional status [49­52]. Control beliefs show a pattern of decline
in adulthood, making older adults more vulnerable in terms of
expectancies about their ability to affect their health [48]. The
sense of control is related to functional health, in part, because
those who have a higher sense of control are more likely to engage
in health-promoting behaviors, such as exercising and eating a
healthier diet [53].
Social interactions involve a combination of supportive and
stressful experiences. High quality social relationships are those in
which support is relatively high and strain relatively low. Social
support is associated with health in that those who are socially
embedded and experience positive relationships are better off than
those who are isolated or involved in strained or stressful
relationships [34,37]. There is also longitudinal evidence for the
relationship between positive social exchanges and patterns of
physical disability [35], and socially vulnerable elderly are more
likely to show disability, frailty, and higher mortality risk [54,55].
The mechanisms that have been considered include physiological
factors such as stress hormones, immune functioning, and
inflammatory processes that may be exacerbated for those with
low social support or social isolation [33,54]. Moreover, those who
have supportive relationships are more likely to reap the benefits of
a more active, engaged and healthy lifestyle [36].
The benefits of physical exercise for health are widely
documented [38,41,56]. Those who engage in regular exercise
are likely to reduce or avoid disability due to the positive effects on,
for example, cardiovascular and pulmonary functioning, bone
density, and muscle mass [57]. Nevertheless, exercise maintenance
is challenging and the long term benefits of exercise interventions
have not been conclusively demonstrated.
The benefits of these factors for health have been considered
separately in past studies, rather than considered together to
examine their unique or combined effects, as we do in the present
study. Another key contribution of the current study is to examine
the protective contribution of psychological, social, and physical
factors to functional health in conjunction with physical risk factors
and health status. In a recent study, multiple risk factors were
considered individually and in combination in relation to mortality
[22,58,59]. They found the benefits of a combined measure in that
the more of the risk factors present, the greater the mortality risk.
However, that study and others focus on the factors that should be
avoided, and whether having these factors results in bad outcomes.
In contrast, the goal of the present study was to consider the
health-promoting role of engaging in psychosocial and behavioral
factors and their effects for minimizing declines in functional
health. Moreover, we provided a conservative test because we
controlled for the effects of health status and traditional physical
risk factors to determine if the protective composite would make a
difference beyond the factors that many studies have shown to
have detrimental effects on health. Thus, the goal of the present
study was to examine the combined contribution of the health-
promoting variables to long-term changes in health, and to
consider their possible protective effect in minimizing aging-
related declines in functional health, beyond the role of socio-
demographic and physical risk factors.
Psychological, social, and physical protective factors have
typically been examined in separate studies. More recently,
however, there has been an emphasis on the contribution of
multiple factors in relation to health. For example, Kvaavik et al.
(2010) [22] showed that the total number of unhealthy risk
behaviors in which one person engages, such as smoking, heavy
drinking, unhealthy nutrition, and lack of physical activity, was
associated with a higher mortality rate. According to Kvaavik et al.
(2010, p.711) [22], ``to fully understand the public health impact of
these behaviors, it is necessary to examine both their individual
and combined impact on health outcomes.'' The procedure of
aggregating different sources of influence stems from the
observation that health-related lifestyle factors are not randomly
distributed in the general population, but that they tend to occur
in combination with each other within individuals [60]. Other
examples of this multidimensional approach include computing a
cardiovascular risk [61] index or marker of allostatic load [62],
which include multiple health indicators and predict disease better
than individual indicators. Our goal was to consider the role of
multiple factors for maintenance of functional health in middle
and older age. Only a modest literature has addressed the
relationship between protective psychosocial and behavioral
factors and functional limitations [24,63,64,65,66], and we know
of no studies showing their combined effects.
We predicted that, in combination, the protective factors would
be associated with functional health over a 10 year period, after
controlling for relevant socio-demographic variables, health status,
and physical risk factors. We expected that the more of the
psychosocial and behavioral factors present at Time 1, the better
the maintenance of functional health. We also expected to find
evidence for the individual, unique effects of a strong sense of
control over life outcomes, high quality of social relationships with
friends and family, and frequent vigorous physical exercise on
functional health. Previous research has shown that age differences
in disability are attenuated by physical exercise [39]. Thus, in the
present study we also predicted that the protective factor would
serve as a moderator of age differences in functional health. We
expected that functional declines would be greater for older adults
than for the middle-aged and younger adults, and we examined
whether the protective effects would be most beneficial for the
older adults. Furthermore, we tested if change in the number of
protective factors over time predicted change in functional health
while controlling the number of factors at Time 1.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
Ethical approval was obtained from the Social and Behavioral
Science Institutional Review Board at University of Wisconsin-
Madison and by the Committee for Protection of Human Subjects
at Brandeis University. All participants gave verbal consent, which
included assurance of voluntary participation and confidentiality
of data. The ethics committees approved the waiver of written
consent. Such passive consent is customary for survey research by
telephone and mail questionnaire.
Sample
Participants were from the Midlife in the United States
(MIDUS) survey, conducted in 1995­1996 and 2004­2006,
designed to investigate the role of behavioral, social, psychological,
biological, and neurological factors in understanding physical and
mental health as people age.
A national sample (N = 4,238) from the 48 contiguous states was
selected using random-digit dialing (RDD) of telephone numbers
with age and sex information about the household composition,
with an overall response rate of 70% for the telephone interview
[67]. The study also included siblings (N = 949) of the main
respondents, randomly selected from the RDD sample, as well as a
subpopulation of twins (N = 1,913) obtained after screening a

representative national sample of approximately 50,000 house-
holds. At Time 1 (N = 7,100) participants ranged in age from 24­
75 years (M = 46.40, SD = 13.00). At Time 2, the longitudinal
retention rate, adjusted for mortality, was 75% (N = 4,955), with
ages ranging from 32 to 84 years (M = 55.45 years, SD = 12.44). As
typically found, those who participated at the second wave showed
positive selection (Table S1) on most variables compared with
those who dropped out of the study. For more information on the
sample see Radler and Ryff (2010) [68]. When we compared those
with complete data who were included in the present analyses
(N = 3,626) with those excluded, we found the same pattern of
positive selection (Table 1).
Measures
Functional Health. This measure was based on seven items
from the Physical Functioning subscale from the SF-36 Health
Survey (a reliability = .90 at Time 1; a reliability = .92 at Time 2)
[69]. Three items from the original scale were omitted: one item
because it was not measured at Time 1 and the two others because
they directly referred to physical exercise, one of our predictors.
The seven items, which capture the extent to which the
participants' health level limits them in doing different activities
(e.g., lifting or carrying groceries, climbing several flights of stairs),
were averaged. The same items were used at both times of
measurement. The scores ranging from 1 (a lot) to 4 (not at all)
were transformed so that the lowest possible score was 0 and the
highest possible score 100 [70]. A higher score indicates better
health.
Protective Factors. We examined three factors from the
psychological, social and physical domains.
Control beliefs at Time 1 and Time 2 were assessed with a 12-item
composite (a reliability Time 1 = .85; Time 2 = .87). This measure
of perceived control over outcomes in life was computed by
averaging scores on two subscales from the MIDUS sense of
control scale [29], namely personal mastery (e.g., I can do just
about anything I really set my mind to) and perceived constraints
(e.g., What happens in my life is often beyond my control). The
scores range from 1 (strongly agree) to 7 (strongly disagree) and
were reverse coded for personal mastery. A higher value indicates
higher sense of control.
For quality of social support, we included items reflecting social
support and reverse coded items for social strain for close
relationships. This measure (a reliability Time 1 = .87; Time
2 = .88) was the average of the ratings on 12 items assessing
socioemotional aspects of social support (e.g., How much do
members of your family really care about you) and 12 items
assessing the social strain (e.g., How often do members of your
family make too many demands on you) that the participants
experienced in their relationships with family, friends, and spouse/
partner [37,71]. The scores range from 1 (never) to 4 (often), with
a higher value indicating greater quality of social support.
For physical exercise, participants reported the frequency of
engaging in vigorous physical activities (e.g., running or lifting
heavy objects) to work up a sweat, during the summer and winter
months at Time 1 [39]. The total physical exercise score
throughout the year was the mean of summer and winter ratings,
which ranged from 1 (never) to 6 (several times a week or more).
At Time 2, six questions assessing the participant's frequency of
vigorous physical exercise were used. These questions referred to
frequency of physical activities separately for the summer and
winter months, in three different settings (i.e., home, work, and
leisure), with ratings from 1 (never) to 6 (several times a week). We
computed the mean across summer and winter in all three settings
and we selected the exercise intensity and setting with the
maximum value to represent the highest frequency of physical
activity across all domains. At both occasions, higher scores
indicate more frequent physical exercise.
To compute the protective composite at Time 1 and Time 2, for
each factor we assigned the participants a score of 0 (below the
median) or 1 (equal to or above the median) for control beliefs
(Median Time 1 = 5.75; Time 2 = 5.75), quality of social support
(Median Time 1 = 3.21; Time 2 = 3.29), and physical exercise
(Median Time 1 = 4.50; Time 2 = 4). The composites were
obtained by summing the 3 assigned scores. The total scores
ranged from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating a greater number
of factors present at the higher, more desirable level. For
comparative purposes, an alternative method was used to compute
the composite. In this case we computed z-scores for each of the
three factors and summed them to create a continuous linear
composite score, as recommended for examining sensitivity in

other composites such as allostatic load [72]. The results using this
approach (Table S2) were consistent with the median split
composite results. For ease of presentation and interpretation,
we used the median split method for the analyses presented here.
Socio-demographic Variables. We examined age, sex (21 =
men, 1 = women), highest level of education in years (ranging from
6 to 20 years), and self-assessed race (21 = non Hispanic white,
1 = all others).
Health Status. This measure taken at Time 1 assessed how
many of the following conditions the participants reported ever
having: diabetes, stroke, lupus, HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis,
epilepsy or other neurological disorders, cancer, or heart trouble
(e.g., heart attack). Participants were assigned a score of 1 for any
of the chronic conditions. The final score could range from 0 to 7.
Physical Risk Factors. The waist circumference, a good
indicator of obesity that is linked to disability [73], was
measured in inches, at the level of the navel, by the participant
at Time 1. For the data analysis, this variable was standardized
separately for men (M = 38.03, SD = 4.55) and women (M = 33.13,
SD = 5.71). For smoking, participants were asked if they smoke
cigarettes regularly now (at Time 1, 21 = no, 1 = yes). For alcohol or
drug problems, participants reported at Time 1 if they have
experienced or have been treated for alcohol or drug problems
during the past 12 months (21 = no, 1 = yes).
Data Analysis
For the analyses, we included the participants (N = 3,626) who
completed all the measures of interest: the protective factors and
the covariates at Time 1 and functional health at both occasions.
We used hierarchical multiple regression to examine to what
extent the individual protective factors and all possible combina-
tions at Time 1 are associated with change in functional health
over the 8 to 10 years, and whether the association with age is
moderated by the number of protective factors. Although there is
much discussion about the best ways to examine change, the
residualized change method we used, in which we predicted Time
2 while controlling for the level of health at Time 1, is the most
straightforward and widely accepted approach with two occasions
of measurement [74]. The regression models also adjusted for the
effects of socio-demographic variables, health status, and the
physical risk factors. For testing whether change in the number of
protective factors over time was related to change in health, we
used the difference between the two protective composites (Time 2
level minus Time 1 level) as a predictor, while adjusting for the
composite score at Time 1, functional health at Time 1, and
covariates. For this analysis, we included the participants with
complete longitudinal data on all measures including the three
protective factors at both time points (N = 3,578). We also
examined a model in which change in the protective factor was
converted to a categorical variable (i.e., decrease, stable, increase),
controlling for time 1 level, and we found the same results.
As our sample also included siblings of the main respondents
and a subpopulation of twins, we also ran models using the cluster
option in STATA [75]. This model takes dependencies into
account using robust standard errors by clustering at the family
level. We found the same results with this more conservative
approach. We report the results for both the standard and
clustered models in Table 2.
Results
The means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations for all
variables are presented in Table S3. Over 8 to 10 years, individual
differences in functional health [r(3576) = .58, p,.001] and the
protective composite [r(3576) = .47, p,.001] were relatively stable,
although there was significant average decline for both measures
[t(3577) = 22.72, p,.001; t(3577) = 2.67, p = .008, respectively].
Correlation analysis revealed that health was negatively associated
with age [Time 1: r(3576) = 2.21, p,.001; Time 2: r(3576) = 2.33,
p,.001] and positively related to education level [Time 1: r(3576)
= .18, p,.001; Time 2: r(3576) = .23, p,.001]. Men had higher
functional health at Time 1 [r(3576) = 2.13, p,.001] and Time 2
[r(3576) = 2.12, p,.001] than women, and non Hispanic whites
had higher functional health at Time 1 [r(3576) = 2.07, p,.001]
than all others, but race was not significantly related at Time 2
[r(3576) = 2.02, p = .211]. Also, in line with previous research, the
risk factors (large waist circumference, smoking, and having alcohol
or drug problems, respectively), were negatively associated with
functional health at Time 1 [r(3576) = 2.23, p,.001; r(3576) =
2.08, p,.001; r(3576) = 2.03, p = .054] and Time 2 [r(3576) =
2.26, p,.001; r(3576) = 2.10, p,.001; r(3576) = 2.05, p = .001].
Moreover, results revealed the expected positive correlations
between psychosocial and behavioral factors and health. Higher
control beliefs, greater social support, and more frequent physical
exercise at Time 1 were associated with better functional health at
both occasions of measurement, respectively, [Time 1: r(3576) =
.22, p,.001; r(3576) = .11, p,.001; r(3576) = .33, p,.001; Time 2:
[r(3576) = .23, p,.001; r(3576) = .09, p,.001; r(3576) = .29,
p,.001]. The same relationships with health were obtained with all
variables measured at Time 2, between functional health and
control beliefs [r(3576) = .30, p,.001], social support [r(3576) =
.09, p,.001], and physical exercise [r(3576) = .22, p,.001].
First, we tested a model including all three dichotomous
protective factors at Time 1 (low/high levels). While controlling for
socio-demographic, health status, and risk factors, all three
predictors, high sense of control [B = .03, t(3613) = 2.40,
p = .016], high quality social support [B = .03, t(3613) = 2.59,
p = .010], and frequent physical exercise [B = .03, t(3613) = 2.50,
p = .013] were significantly associated with less decline in
functional health. The similar values of the standardized regression
coefficients provide a rationale for computing the composite with
equal weights for each protective factor.
To test our main hypotheses, we conducted hierarchical
multiple regression to examine predictors of residualized change
in functional health, with and without using the robust standard
errors (Table 2). The dependent variable was Time 2 functional
health, and at the first step we controlled for Time 1 functional
health, socio-demographic predictors, and health status; all were
statistically significant and accounted for 41% of the variance [F(6,
3619) = 420.91, p,.001]. Consistent with past work, older age
was associated with greater decline in functional health. In the
second step, introducing the Time 1 physical risk factors led to a
significant increase in the percentage of variance [R2
change = .024, F Change (3, 3616) = 51.22, p,.001].
At the third step, when the 3 protective factors were entered as
an aggregate score, the composite had a significant effect [B = .06,
t(3615) = 4.90, p,.001] on change in functional health, over and
above the role of socio-demographic, health status, and risk
factors, and added significant additional variance [R2
change = .004, F Change (1, 3615) = 23.97, p,.001]. The more
behavioral factors one has, the greater the maintenance of health
over 8 to 10 years (Figure 1). This was also illustrated by the
percentages of explained variance obtained in a complementary
model (Table S4), including each of the protective factors
individually (steps 3.1a, 3.1b, 3.1c), in combinations of two (steps
3.2a, 3.2b, 3.2c), as well as the above mentioned three-factor
composite (step 3.3). Moreover, all the individual protective factors
explained a significant percent of variance, over and above the role

of the socio-demographics, health status, and risk factors. The
same was true for all possible pairs of protective factors, which, as
indicated by the percentages of explained variance (R2 change =
.003), had an equal contribution to change in functional health.
Further analyses also showed that, in all cases, adding a third
factor resulted in a significant increase in R2 over and above each
of the two factor combinations.
Also using multiple regression, we examined whether the effect
of the 3-factor composite on change in functional health varied by
age. A significant age by composite interaction showed that the
difference in functional health between younger and older adults
was significantly reduced with an increased number of protective
factors [Figure 2, B = .03, t(3614) = 2.13, p = .033].
We also examined whether change in the number of protective
factors over time was related to maintenance or change in
functional health. While controlling for the Time 1 composite,
functional health, socio-demographic variables, and physical risk
factors, the greater the increase in the number of factors the better
the health at Time 2 [B = .09, t(3566) = 6.22, p,.001]. In this
model, the number of protective factors at Time 1 remained
significantly associated with functional health [B = .12, t(3566) =
7.35, p,.001].
Discussion
The results provide support for the role of modifiable
psychological, social, and physical protective factors, in addition
to minimizing physical risk factors, as a means for reducing
physical disability. On average, functional health declined
significantly over the 8 to 10 years and, as expected, the declines
were greatest in later life. Yet, those who engaged in multiple
factors were protected in that they showed better maintenance of
functional health. Whereas previous research has typically
examined one of these factors at a time {e.g., [54,56]}, we found
that each of the factors had a unique independent contribution,
with or without adjusting for the other factors. Moreover, the
results show evidence for the additive value of these factors, and
the more of them the better in terms of health outcomes. Although
the psychosocial and behavioral factors were beneficial for health
at all ages, a key promising finding is that age differences in
functional health were significantly attenuated and health declines

were reduced as a function of the number of protective factors
present at adaptive levels 8 to 10 years earlier. This is consistent
with previous findings on the potential of protective factors such as
physical exercise to reduce age differences in functional health
[39]. The protective factors were found to have a differentially
beneficial effect at the oldest ages that is, among those who are
most at risk and vulnerable to functional declines. Among older
adults who had all 3 protective factors at adaptive levels, their
functional health was more comparable with the level of those in
the younger and middle-aged groups. The relationship between
protective factors at Time 1 and functional health at Time 2 is
significant when controlling for Time 1 functional health,
illustrating that the effects are related to long term maintenance
or change in health, independent of initial level of health.
Moreover, engaging in more protective factors over time was
positively related to functional health, independent of the number
of behaviors people adopted earlier in life.
Some limitations of the study should be noted, especially the
restricted measurement of some variables (e.g., smoking, alcohol
and drug problems, physical exercise). We used self-report
assessments for all variables, and the relationships could be
affected by a common measurement bias. Nevertheless, the
psychosocial variables are typically measured using self report,
given the focus on perceptions and expectancies. Moreover, the
functional health measure has been well validated in relation to
objective indicators of disability in previous work [76]. In the case
of both health and exercise, more objective measures (e.g.,
pedometers for physical exercise) may be examined in future
studies. Also, the generalizability of findings must be considered in
light of the positive selection of the longitudinal sample, although
the large probability base for the sample is an asset. Although the
present study design with two waves of measurement enabled us to
examine changes in health and protective factors, including three
or more occasions will allow for consideration of the multi-
directionality and consistency of these patterns using more
sophisticated analytic models [77].
The study shows the importance of considering long-term
predictors of functional health, with a goal of reducing disability,
improving quality of life, and reducing health care costs. Some
groups may be more susceptible to health problems and less likely
to engage in the protective factors, such as those who are older or
those with lower socioeconomic status (SES) [24]. Acknowledging
these vulnerabilities could lead to targeted interventions to reduce
age and SES differences in health. The lifestyle factors in midlife
(e.g., the 50's) showed a protective effect for health in later life
(e.g., the 60's) [78] and the more of them the better. The
promising findings raise possibilities of examining the joint effects
of other psychosocial and behavioral factors such as stress
reactivity and regulation [79], spirituality and religious activity
[80], nutrition and diet [81], and to investigate whether there
would be continued value added. Moreover, future work is needed
to explore the mechanisms {e.g., stress hormones [82], inflam-
mation [83], allostatic load [84]} that may be involved in linking
the protective factors to health.
The findings suggest that multifaceted psychosocial and
behavioral interventions that target multiple components such as
a sense of control, good quality social relationships with family and
friends, and physical exercise in early adulthood and midlife could
have a dramatic protective effect in reducing disability and
maintaining functional health and independence into later life
[85], over and above the contribution of reducing physical risk
factors [20,21,24,26]. One implication of the findings is that
multidimensional interventions may be more effective than ones
focused on single dimensions for improving health quality of life.
An example is a clinical trial successful in reducing disability
among sedentary older adults [41,86], by focusing on multiple
factors: improving the sense of control over exercise, increasing
physical strength with resistance training, and providing social
support from an exercise trainer. This type of multimodal
intervention is likely to result in higher compliance and better
maintenance than studies that rely only on changing physical
activity without the psychological mindset and social support
needed to promote long-term behavioral changes. Given the
increasing expenditures on health care for those over age 65 with
physical limitations during the last decade [6], the results are
encouraging for the prospect of reducing public health expendi-
tures for physical disability in later life.
