Purpose: This study tested the applicability of the
activity restriction model of depressed affect to the
context of poor vision in late life. This model hypoth-
esizes that late-life stressors contribute to poorer men-
tal health not only directly but also indirectly by
restricting routine everyday functioning. Method:
We used data from a national probability-based
sample of older adults (N = 1,178; M = 69.2 years,
approximately 50% female). Vision was assessed
both subjectively (via self-report) and objectively (via
a visual acuity test). Respondents also reported on
their levels of physical and driving limitations, feel-
ings of social isolation, and symptoms of depres-
sion. Results: Path analyses indicated a strong
fit of the data to the activity restriction model for sub-
jective vision. In addition to directly contributing to
higher depressive symptomatology, subjective vision
contributed to depressive symptoms indirectly by
predicting more physical limitations and feelings
of social isolation that, in turn, contributed to
more symptoms of depression; driving limitations
did not mediate the relationship between subjec-
tive vision and depressive symptomatology. Objec-
tive vision contributed significantly to physical and
driving limitations but was unrelated to feelings of
social isolation and depressive symptomatology.
Implications: Supporting the activity restriction
model, poorer self-rated vision in late life contributes
to lower mental health directly and also indirectly by
restricting individuals' ability to carry out routine
day-to-day physical activities and increasing their
feelings of social isolation. Interventions for older
adults with vision-related problems could focus on
maintaining or enhancing their physical and social
functioning in order to promote their adaptation to
poor vision.
Key Words: Vision-related conditions, Functioning,
Depressive symptoms
Good visual capacity is among the most impor-
tant contributors to the value older individuals
attach to their lives (Jopp, Roth, & Oswald, 2008).
With advancing age, however, vision-related prob-
lems are a common stressor. Recent estimates
obtained from the National Health Interview Sur-
vey indicate that 17% of individuals 65+ years of
age reported having trouble with their vision even
with corrective glasses and lenses (Federal Inter-
agency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, 2008).
Much evidence indicates that poor visual function
can have adverse effects on the lives and well-being
of older adults (e.g., Crews, 1994; Federal Inter-
agency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, 2008;
Horowitz, 2004; O'Donnell, 2005). For example,
Wahl, Schilling, Oswald, and Heyl (1999) found
that poorer visual ability was related to lower sub-
jective well-being in a sample of older adults
recruited through physician practices. Bourque,
Leger, Pushkar, and Beland (2007) reported that
poor vision was related to lower life satisfaction in
a representative sample of older Canadians, and

Reinhardt (1996) found a similar relationship in a
convenience sample of visually impaired older
adults residing in the United States.
An especially well-established finding is that
poor vision is linked to lower psychological health
or emotional well-being, most notably to higher
depressive symptomatology. Research indicates
that not only are symptoms of depression elevated
in older adults diagnosed with diseases of the
eye such as age-related macular degeneration
(e.g., Casten & Rovner, 2008; Tolman, Hill,
Kleinschmidt, & Gregg, 2005) but also that
poorer visual capacity in general is reliably linked
to more depressed affect in late life. For example,
Lupsakko, Mantyjarvi, Kautiainen, and Sulkava
(2002) found that higher levels of depressive symp-
tomatology occurred in a population-based sam-
ple of visually impaired older adults relative to
their nonimpaired peers, and Crews, Jones, and
Kim (2006) reported that mild or moderate levels
of depressive symptoms are a common comorbid
condition among elders who are visually impaired.
Numerous other studies with convenience and
probability-based samples also have found that
older adults who rated their vision to be poorer
had higher levels of depressive symptomatology
(e.g., Brody et al., 2001; Casten, Rovner, &
Edmonds, 2001; Chou, 2008; Femia, Zarit, &
Johansson, 2001; Furner, Wallace, Arguelles,
Miles, & Goldberg, 2006; Reinhardt, 1996).
The current study builds on this body of litera-
ture by testing three mediators in the link between
poor vision and depressive symptomatology. It
uses the activity restriction model of depressed
affect (Williamson & Christie, 2009; Williamson
& Shaffer, 2000) as the theoretical framework,
which explains that an important factor in indi-
viduals' psychological adjustment when faced with
life stressors is the extent to which the stressor
restricts their normal day-to-day activities. Accord-
ing to this model, disruptions in carrying out nor-
mal personal and social activities (e.g., shopping,
visiting friends) at least partially account for the
link between health-related stressors and emotional
well-being. The model thus proposes mediational
pathways, whereby life stressors such as chronic
physical health problems often contribute not only
directly to poorer mental health outcomes but also
contribute indirectly via their adverse effects on
individuals' ability to carry out day-to-day routine
activities. Such activity restriction, in its turn, con-
tributes to poorer mental health and emotional
well-being. The activity restriction model has
garnered considerable support in studies on late-
life stressors such as chronic pain, family caregiv-
ing, and living with breast cancer, demonstrating
that the link from such stressors to depressive
symptomatology is mediated partially or wholly
by declines in physical functioning and/or social
engagement (Bookwala, Harralson, & Parmelee,
2003; Bookwala & Schulz, 2000; Williamson,
2000a, 2000b; Williamson & Dooley, 2001;
Williamson & Shaffer, 2000). However, the activ-
ity restriction model of depressed affect has
received little attention in the domain of vision
impairment. In this study, we propose that the
model offers a theoretically viable explanation for
the impact of vision impairment on depressed
affect in late life. Based on the activity restriction
model, we hypothesize that poor vision contrib-
utes to depressed affect not only directly but it also
results in more limitations in the performance of
personal and social activities that, in turn, contrib-
ute to higher depressed mood.
Poor vision among older adults has consistently
been found to have adverse effects on a wide vari-
ety of day-to-day functional domains. Numerous
studies have found that poor vision diminishes
older adults' ability to carry out everyday physical
activities (e.g., Branch, Horowitz, & Carr, 1989;
Crews et al., 2006; Lind & Nordholm, 1999;
Horowitz, 1994; Laforge, Spector, & Sternberg,
1992; Travis, Boerner, Reinhardt, & Horowitz,
2004; West et al., 1997). For example, Gunnel and
Nordholm found that reading, writing, and watch-
ing television were common functional problems
associated with poor vision. In addition, mobility-
related problems, such as difficulty with moving
about outdoors, driving or using public transporta-
tion, and conducting bank-related business, were
commonly reported by their visually impaired
elderly sample. Travis and colleagues found that
older adults with impaired vision reported higher
levels of difficulty with instrumental activities of
daily living (e.g., selecting/locating and identifying
clothing, food items, and money; using a telephone;
writing checks; and taking medications) and that
these individuals identified these visual problems
rather than other health problems as the source of
these difficulties. Crews and colleagues also found
that older adults who reported visual impairment
were more likely to report difficulty performing
everyday tasks, such as walking, climbing steps,
and shopping relative to their age-matched peers.
A functional domain in late life that is particu-
larly adversely affected by poor vision is driving

ability (e.g., Horowitz, Boerner, & Reinhardt,
2002; Keay et al., 2009; Satariano, MacLeod,
Cohn, & Ragland, 2004). Indeed, studies have
reported that older adults often cite problems with
their eyesight as the reason they limited their driv-
ing or avoided driving altogether (Persson, 1993;
Ragland, Satariano, & MacLeod, 2004). An
emerging literature also indicates that in addition
to contributing to limitations in physical function
and driving ability, poor vision can have an adverse
impact on social functioning domains, such as
social network size, relationship maintenance, and
social integration (O'Donnell, 2005; Reinhardt,
Boerner, & Benn, 2003; Wahl & Tesch-Romer,
2001). Accordingly, studies have found that poor
vision is correlated with lower levels of social inte-
gration (Femia et al., 2001), more difficulty engag-
ing in social relationships (Crews et al., 2006), and
higher levels of social isolation (Femia et al., 2001).
Despite widespread evidence from individual stud-
ies linking poor vision in older adults to either
their functioning (physical, driving-related, or
social) or depressive symptoms, there has been
little attempt to examine the interrelationships
among these variables simultaneously. We address
this gap in the literature by testing these relation-
ships in a single model using the activity restriction
model of depressed affect as our guiding frame-
work, which posits that the contribution of stressors
such as poor vision to depressive symptomatology
is explained at least partially by the impact of poor
vision on multiple domains of functioning.
In the present study, we tested the role of three
mediators--physical limitations, driving limita-
tions, and feelings of social isolation--in the link
from vision impairment to depressive symptom-
atology using both subjective (self-report) and
objective (visual acuity test) indicators of vision
impairment. Difficulties with performing day-to-day
activities have been used as indicators of activity
restriction by Williamson (2000b), and feelings of
social isolation have received attention in other
vision research (Femia et al., 2001). Subjective and
objective measures of vision are included in the
study because they provide complementary infor-
mation on visual ability among older adults
(Horowitz, 2004) and including both can offer a
more comprehensive understanding of the effects
of vision on psychological health. We drew data
for this study from the National Social Life, Health,
and Aging Project (NSHAP; O'Muircheartaigh,
Eckman, & Smith, 2009; Smith et al., 2009), a
survey-based study of a nationally representative
sample of older adults residing in the United States.
Consistent with the activity restriction model of
Williamson (2000) and Williamson and Shaffer
(2000), we tested (a) the direct link from subjective
and objective vision to depressive symptoms and
(b) the extent to which this association is mediated
by functional impairment and social isolation
known to result from poor vision. We hypothe-
sized that poor vision--assessed both subjectively
and objectively--will be associated with greater
depressive symptomatology and that more physi-
cal and driving limitations and more feelings of
social isolation will at least partially account for
this association. We predicted that these relation-
ships would exist after controlling for sociodemo-
graphic variables that are known to be related to
functioning and depressive symptomatology in
older samples such as ours, including age, gender,
education level, race, and marital status.
Methods
Sample
Our sample consisted of older adults who par-
ticipated in the NSHAP (O'Muircheartaigh et al.,
2009; Smith et al., 2009). The NSHAP is a large-
scale survey study that assessed components of
health, social relationships, and well-being in older
adults aged 57­85 years using face-to-face inter-
views and self-administered questionnaires. The
NSHAP data were collected in 2005­2006 for
which eligible cases were identified as part of a
larger national area probability sample of house-
holds (O'Muircheartaigh et al., 2009). The NSHAP
sample was balanced on age and gender subgroups
and oversampled African Americans and Latinos.
Approximately 50% of the original NSHAP sam-
ple (N = 3,005) was randomly selected to receive
the objective vision assessment (N = 1,506). To be
eligible for the present analyses, respondents who
were sampled to receive the objective assessment
had to have no missing data on the study variables.
This yielded a final sample of 1,170 older adults
(77.7% of NSHAP respondents who were ran-
domly selected for the objective vision assessment).
On average, respondents were approximately 69.2
years of age (SD = 7.9) and 50.7% of the sample
was female (N = 593). The majority of the sample
had at least a high-school diploma or equivalent
(79.3%, N = 928). More than 80% of the sample
described their ethnic background as White
(80.3%, N = 939), 13.1% (N = 153) as Black, and
6.7% (N = 78) as other. Almost two thirds of the
Vol. 51, No. 6, 2011 801
sample were married or living with a partner
(65.9%, N = 770), 10.2% (N = 120) was sepa-
rated or divorced, almost one fifth was widowed
(19.7%, N = 231), and 4.2% (N = 49) was never
married.
Measures
Vision.--Self-reported vision (subjective vision)
was assessed in the NSHAP using a single-item
measure with a 5-point rating scale (Schumm
et al., 2009). Respondents were asked to rate their
eyesight using the item "With your glasses or con-
tact lenses if you wear them, is your eyesight poor,
fair, good, very good, or excellent?" Responses
were recoded such that higher scores represented
poorer self-reported vision. The mean rating for
self-reported vision was 2.54 (SD = 1.05). Slightly
less than half the sample subjectively rated their
vision to be poor (4.3%, N = 50), fair (12.2%,
N = 143), or good (33.4%, N = 391). The remain-
ing respondents rated their vision to be very good
(33.0%, N = 386) or excellent (17.1%, N = 200).
Visual acuity (objective vision) was assessed in
both eyes together at a distance of 3 m using a
chart with Sloan optotypes manufactured by Preci-
sion Vision (catalog number 2104; Schumm et al.,
2009). NSHAP interviewers were trained to follow
a detailed protocol to ensure consistent distance
from the chart (via use of a premeasured string laid
out on the floor), line of sight (the interviewer
seated the respondent and held the chart at the
respondent's eye level), and lighting (sufficient
light for reading with low glare or strong back-
lighting). Respondents who normally wore glasses
or contact lenses for driving or distance vision
were instructed to wear them during the test and
asked to begin reading the smallest discernible line.
Success or not on this task resulted in the respon-
dent being instructed to read the successive line
directly below or above the just-read line, respec-
tively, until the smallest discernible line that could
be successfully read was determined. Performance
on the visual acuity test was coded using standard
guidelines (Schumm et al., 2009). Scores of 20/20
vision or better were coded as "normal or better"
vision, between 20/40 and 20/20 were coded as
"good" vision, between approximately 20/60 and
20/40 were coded as "moderately decreased"
vision, and those with worse scores were coded as
"poor" vision. Respondents who were unable to
read the largest line on the Sloan chart at 3 m rep-
resented visual acuity worse than 20/200; these
individuals were coded to have 20/200 vision. The
mean score on the visual acuity test was 1.14
(SD = 0.76). Based on their performance on this
test, 16.3% (N = 191) had "normal or better"
vision, more than 60% had "good" vision (60.7%,
N = 710), 16.1% (N = 188) had "moderately
decreased" vision, and almost 7% (6.9%, N = 81)
had "poor" vision (N = 27 scored 20/80, N = 20
scored 20/100, and N = 34 scored 20/125 or worse).
Functional limitations were assessed in terms of
difficulty with day-to-day physical function and
difficulty with driving. Seven items assessing the
amount of difficulty that respondents experienced
related to walking (e.g., walking a street block,
walking across a room) and self-care activities
(e.g., dressing, eating, using the toilet, bathing or
showering, getting in and out of bed) were summed
to yield a measure of physical limitations. Driving
limitations were measured via the sum of responses
to two items, difficulty experienced driving during
the day and driving at night. Responses to items
assessing physical and driving limitations were
made on a 4-point scale (1 = no difficulty, 2 = some
difficulty, 3 = much difficulty, and 4 = unable to
do). Activities that had never been performed were
scored as "no difficulty "; for the driving items,
respondents could indicate that they no longer
drove, which was coded as "unable to do." For
both measures, responses were scored such
that higher scores represented greater difficulty.
The physical limitations measure obtained a
Cronbach's alpha of .82, and the driving limita-
tions measure obtained a Cronbach's alpha of
.83. Mean scores on physical limitations and
driving limitations were 8.1 (SD = 2.20) and 2.94
(SD = 1.75), respectively.
Feelings of social isolation were assessed using
three items (how often do you feel isolated from
others, feel that you lack companionship, and feel
left out?) adapted from the UCLA Loneliness Scale
(Russell, Peplau, & Cutrona, 1980). Similar items
were used by Femia and colleagues (2001) in their
study of outcomes associated with vision impair-
ment to measure feelings of social isolation in older
adults. Responses to these items were made using
a 3-point scale ranging from hardly ever or never
to often, and scores were summed such that higher
scores represented more feelings of social isolation
(Cronbach's a = .80). The sample mean for social
isolation was 3.97 (SD = 1.4).
Depressive symptomatology was measured using
an 11-item version of the Center for Epidemiologi-
cal Studies-Depression scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977)
The Gerontologist
802
that assesses the severity of depressive symptoms
over a 1-week recall period. Items (e.g., "I could
not `get going'" and "I felt that everything I did
was an effort") were answered on a 4-point scale
ranging from rarely/none of the time to most of the
time. (It should be noted that the response scale in
the NSHAP, which ranged from 1 to 4, was
recoded for this study to match the original CES-D
scale, which ranges from 0 to 3.) Higher scores
reflected greater depressive symptomatology, and
the scale was internally consistent (Cronbach's
a = .79). Mean depressive symptomatology was
5.44 (SD = 5.16).
Control Variables.--Sociodemographic variables
included age, gender, education level, race, and
marital status; these variables were measured in the
NSHAP using standard self-report items. In the
model testing, race was coded as a dichotomous
variable (White vs. non-White) as was marital sta-
tus (married vs. not); gender was coded as 1 = male
and 2 = female.
Data Analyses
Descriptive statistics and zero-order correlations
between study variables were computed first.
Model testing was conducted via path analytic
procedures using the EQS statistical software pro-
gram (Bentler & Wu, 1995) and maximum likeli-
hood estimation of path coefficients. All variables
in the model were treated as observed variables in
the analysis. Direct paths were specified from sub-
jective and objective vision to the three mediator
variables (physical limitations, driving limitations,
and feelings of social isolation) and depressive
symptomatology; indirect paths from subjective
and objective vision to depressive symptomatology
via the mediator variables also were estimated.
Sociodemographic variables (age, education level,
gender, marital status, and race) were included as
control variables in the model testing as follows:
(a) when significant bivariate correlations (p < .01)
between the control and study variables were
obtained, these relationships were included as
paths in the model and (b) covariances were esti-
mated between control variables that were signifi-
cantly correlated with each other (p < .01). The
Wald test (which identifies parameters that can be
dropped without significantly compromising
model fit) and the Lagrange test (which identifies
parameters that, if added, could significantly improve
model fit) were used to identify improvements for
the overall fit of the model and to generate a more
parsimonious model.
To determine the fit of the model to the data, we
computed multiple goodness-of-fit indices, includ-
ing the c2 goodness-of-fit index, the comparative
fit index (CFI), the incremental fit index (IFI),
normed and non-normed fit indices (NFI and
NNFI), the standardized mean-square residual
(SRMR), and the root mean-square error of
approximation (RMSEA). Multiple fit indices are
recommended because the c2 goodness-of-fit sta-
tistic is sensitive to sample size, and thus, in tests
with even reasonably sized samples, relying solely
on the c2 goodness-of-fit index can result in the
rejection of a theoretically meaningful model
(Bentler, 1990). Acceptable cutoffs for these fit
indices include a nonsignificant c2 goodness of fit
(p > .05); values of .95 or larger for CFI, IFI, NFI,
and NNFI; and SRMR and RMSEA values of .06
or lower (Hu & Bentler, 1999).
Results
Zero-order correlations between study variables
are listed in Table 1. A small but statistically sig-
nificant correlation was obtained between self-
reported vision and scores on the visual acuity test
(r = .29, p < .001). Consistent with expectations,
in general, poorer self-reported and objectively
assessed vision was related to more physical and
driving limitations, feelings of social isolation, and
symptoms of depression. As Table 1 indicates, the
bivariate relationships between subjective vision
and these variables were somewhat stronger than
seen with objective vision.
Next, we conducted a path analysis using the
EQS software to test the activity restriction model
of depressed affect in the context of poor vision in
which we hypothesized that the path from poor
vision to depressive symptomatology would be at
least partially mediated by more physical limita-
tions, driving limitations, and social isolation. In
other words, we anticipated that poorer vision
would predict more difficulties with physical func-
tion and driving and more feelings of social isola-
tion that, in turn, would contribute to more
symptoms of depression. To this end, the model
estimated (a1) paths from the exogenous variables
of subjective and objective vision to the four
endogenous variables of physical limitations, driv-
ing limitations, feelings of social isolation, and
depressive symptoms and (b) paths from physical
limitations, driving limitations, and feelings of
Vol. 51, No. 6, 2011 803
social isolation to depressive symptoms (see Figure 1).
In addition, because of the significant bivariate
correlation between the exogenous variables of
subjective and objective vision, they were allowed
to covary; the error variances for physical limita-
tions, driving limitations, and feelings of social iso-
lation also were permitted to covary. Paths also
were estimated as needed from the sociodemo-
graphic variables to each endogenous variable
(physical limitations, driving limitations, social
isolation, and depressive symptomatology) based
on significant bivariate correlations that were
obtained (p < .01, see Table 1). These paths were
as follows: from age to physical limitations and
driving limitations; gender, marital status, and
race to physical limitations, driving limitations,
social isolation, and depressive symptoms; and
education level to physical limitations, driving lim-
itations, and depressive symptoms. Covariances
between significantly correlated (p < .01) control
variables and subjective and objective vision, pairs
of control variables that were significantly corre-
lated, and the error terms for physical limitations,
driving limitations, and feelings of social isolation
also were estimated in the initial test of the model.
Most of the goodness-of-fit estimates yielded by
the initial test of the model indicated a strong fit of
the model to the data (NFI = .982, NNFI = .901,
CFI = .986, IFI = .986, SRMR = .025, RMSEA = .053,
2
8
= 33.98, p < .001). The Wald test results were
examined to determine if the model could be further
improved by dropping paths specified in the initial
test of the conceptual model. Eight paths could be
dropped without compromising model fit, five of
which involved paths from a control variable to an
endogenous variable (from marital status to physi-
cal limitations, driving limitations, and depressive
symptoms; from race to physical limitations; and
from gender to depressive symptoms). Because esti-
mates of these paths were not directly relevant to
the theoretical model, these five parameters were
dropped in the next iteration of model testing. The
remaining three paths were retained in the retest of
the model (from objective vision to feelings of social
isolation and depressive symptoms and from driv-
ing limitations to depressive symptoms) because of
their centrality to the theoretical model. The retest
of this more parsimonious model incorporating
the earlier respecifications yielded even stronger
fit indices (NFI = .983, NNFI = .951, CFI = .989,
IFI = .990, SRMR = .023, RMSEA = .037,
2
12
= 31.31, p < .01). The Lagrange multivariate
test (which identifies parameters that could be
added to the model to improve model fit) in this
model run indicated that the fit of the model could
be significantly improved by estimating a path from
age to social isolation. Thus, this path was added
and the model retested. All fit indices yielded at
this point by the model testing (NFI = .991,
NNFI = .984, CFI = .997, IFI = .997, SRMR = .020,
RMSEA = .021, 2
11
= 16.75, p > .10) exceeded
acceptable cutoff levels (Hu & Bentler, 1999). The

 2 test, which tests the improvement in model fit
offered by the final model over the original model,
indicated that the more parsimonious final model
provided a significantly better fit to the data
over the original model ( 
 2
3
= 17.23, p < .001).
Overall, the final model explained 8.2% of the
variance in physical limitations, 16.5% in driving
limitations, 9.0% in social isolation, and 37.8% in

depressive symptoms. Figure 1 presents the final
model with standardized regression coefficients
for the key paths tested in the model. Significant
paths from the control variables to the endogenous
variables are listed in the notes that accompany
Figure 1.
As hypothesized, poorer self-reported vision
(b = .16, z = 5.31, p < .001) and poorer visual acu-
ity (b = .07, z = 2.14, p < .05) contributed to more
physical limitations; likewise, poorer self-reported
vision and visual acuity contributed to more diffi-
culty experienced with driving (b = .17, z = 5.98,
p < .001 and b = .16, z = 5.41, p < .001, respec-
tively). In other words, both subjectively and
objectively assessed vision predicted lower capac-
ity to carry out day-to-day tasks and drive oneself.
With regard to feelings of social isolation, poorer
subjective vision predicted greater social isolation
(b = .17, z = 5.63, p < .001); objectively assessed
vision did not contribute significantly to feelings of
social isolation, however (b = .02, z < 1, ns). As
Figure 1 also shows, subjectively assessed vision
had a direct effect on depressive symptomatology
(b = .15, z = 5.89, p < .001) such that poorer self-
reported vision predicted more depressive symp-
toms; objectively assessed vision, however, did not
contribute significantly to depressive symptom-
atology in the model (b = .02, z < 1, ns). More
physical limitations (b = .26, z = 10.22, p < .001)
and social isolation (b = .43, z = 17.90, p < .001)
were significantly associated with greater depres-
sive symptomatology as well, but difficulty with
driving was unrelated to symptoms of depression
(b = .03, z = 1.01, ns).
Next, we examined the extent to which the
effects of vision on depressive symptomatology
were mediated by functional impairment and
social isolation. The EQS test of the path model
yielded tests for the overall indirect effects of both
subjective and objective vision on depressive symp-
toms via the set of three mediator variables. These
tests revealed that the collective indirect effect of
self-reported vision on depressive symptoms via
physical limitations, driving limitations, and social
isolation was significant (b = .12, z = 6.99,
p < .001), but objectively assessed vision did not
have an indirect effect on symptoms of depression
via the three mediators (b = .03, z = 1.90, p > .05).
Follow-up Sobel tests were performed subsequently
to separately test the indirect effect of subjectively
assessed vision on depressive symptomatology via
each individual mediator. These tests indicated
that physical limitations (z = 4.71, p < .001) and
feelings of social isolation (z = 5.40, p < .001) indi-
vidually mediated the link between self-reported
vision and depressive symptoms. Driving limita-
tions, however, did not significantly mediate the
link between poor vision and depressive symptom-
atology (z = 1.00, ns). Collectively, these results
indicate that in addition to contributing directly to
depressive symptoms, poorer self-reported vision
also contributes to more depressive symptoms
indirectly by predicting more physical limitations
and feelings of social isolation that, in turn, predict
more depressive symptoms. Individual Sobel tests
were not performed for the mediation of the path
from objectively assessed vision to depressive
symptomatology because the overall model did
not support such mediation.
Discussion
In this study, we examined the interrelation-
ships among objectively and subjectively assessed
vision, functioning, and depressive symptoms in a
representative sample of community-dwelling
older adults who participated in the National
Social Life, Health, and Aging Project. We tested
the applicability of the activity restriction model of
Figure 1. Final path model testing physical limitations, driving
limitations, and social isolation as mediators of the vision-
depressive symptomatology link. Notes: **Standardized path
coefficients significant at p < .01 or better. Significant paths
from the control variables to the endogenous variables (not
shown in Figure 1) were as follows: Being female (b = .09,
z = 2.99, p < .001) and less educated (b = -.13, z = -4.34,
p < .001) were associated with more physical limitations, and
being older (b = .12, z = 4.36, p < .001), female (b = .16,
z = 6.05, p < .001), less educated (b = -.09, z = -2.98,
p < .001), and non-White (b = .06, z = 2.18, p < .05) were
associated with more driving limitations. Being younger
(b = -.12, z = -3.83, p < .001), female (b = .08, z = 2.61, p < .05),
and not married (b = .17, z = 5.71, p < .001) were significantly
associated with more feelings of social isolation. Being less edu-
cated (b = -.07, z = -2.93, p < .01) and being White (b = -.05,
z = -2.00, p < .05) were linked to more depressive symptoms.

depressed affect (Williamson & Christie, 2009;
Williamson & Shaffer, 2000) in the context of
poor vision in late life. According to Williamson's
model, a chronic health-related stressor can con-
tribute to higher depressive symptomatology both
directly as well as indirectly through a cascading
mechanism whereby the stressor also contributes
to poorer overall functioning which, in turn, con-
tributes to more depressive symptoms. Such a cas-
cading mechanism is consistent with research
linking other chronic conditions to disability and,
in turn, disability to poor psychological adapta-
tion (see Kahana, Kahana, Namazi, Kercher, &
Stange, 1997). Our findings show that the activity
restriction model of depressed affect provided an
excellent fit to the data within the context of poor
visual function in late life. Specifically, direct
effects of poor self-reported vision on depressive
symptomatology and its indirect effects on depres-
sive symptomatology via physical limitations and
feelings of social isolation were seen. The data
indicated that poorer self-reported vision directly
predicted higher depressive symptomatology. In
addition, poorer self-reported vision predicted
both greater physical limitations and more social
isolation, and these, in turn, predicted more depres-
sive symptoms. The indirect (or mediated) effect of
poor self-reported vision on depressive symptom-
atology via each of these two mediators was statis-
tically significant. These findings are noteworthy
more so because the tested model controlled for
objective vision as assessed by performance on a
test of visual acuity. The data did not indicate,
however, that limitations in driving during the day
or night mediate the link between poor self-
reported vision and symptoms of depression.
Although both subjective and objective vision pre-
dicted more driving limitations, the latter did not
contribute significantly to depressive symptom-
atology in the overall model. It is plausible that,
after controlling for the effects of poor vision,
restricting their driving activity may serve to con-
trol fears and anxiety about driving that older
adults can experience (Taylor, Alpass, Stephens, &
Towers, 2011) especially when their vision is not
optimal (Persson, 1993; Ragland et al., 2004)
and that this offsets any adverse role of restricted
driving activity in depressed affect.
That restriction in physical and social function
serve as intervening variables that partially
account for the contribution of poor vision to
depressive symptomatology underscores the adverse
impact such restriction can have on psychological
adjustment under stress. Williamson and Dooley
(2001) offer that the restriction of activities--be
they physical or social in nature--may function as
an effective coping behavior that individuals use
when faced with a stressor. For example, in the case
of poor vision, such activity restriction can prevent
falls or accidents. Paradoxically, however, the very
restriction of such routine activities intended to
assist with coping with the stressor can result in
poorer psychological adjustment. Thus, when a
health-related stressor results in activity restriction,
the adverse effects of the stressor may become even
further exacerbated. Our findings in support of the
activity restriction model for vision are generally
consistent with research on the applicability of
this model to understanding the effects of other
health-related stressors, such as chronic pain,
family caregiving, and cancer (Bookwala & Schulz,
2000; Bookwala et al., 2003; Williamson, 2000a;
Williamson & Dooley, 2001; Williamson & Schulz,
1992; Williamson & Shaffer, 2000; Williamson,
Shaffer, & Schulz, 1998).
Although the complete model obtained an excel-
lent fit to the data, it is important to note that the
activity restriction model (Williamson & Christie,
2009; Williamson & Shaffer, 2000) did not obtain
support in the case of objectively assessed vision.
When all model components were considered simul-
taneously, performance on the visual acuity test did
not significantly predict depressive symptoms directly
or indirectly via the mediators. The differential appli-
cability of the activity restriction model of depressed
affect (Williamson & Christie, 2009; Williamson &
Shaffer, 2000) for subjectively versus objectively
assessed vision may be partially explained by the
small (albeit significant) correlation between self-
reported vision and the visual acuity test, suggesting
low concordance between subjective and objective
assessments of vision. Low concordance between
subjective and objective vision has been reported in
earlier research (Fors, Thorslund, & Parker, 2006)
and may signify that self-reported vision is a broader
more global construct that is likely also to be based
on comparisons with past visual ability and/or more
vision-related dimensions rather than on distance
vision alone (e.g., ease of reading printed material).
Supporting evidence comes from studies that have
found that difficulty with reading and taking medica-
tion pills are frequently experienced by older adults
who have poor vision (Raasch & Rubin, 1993;
Windham et al., 2005).
Subjective and objective measures of vision also
are viewed as offering complementary information
The Gerontologist

on visual ability among older adults, and each may
serve to counter the limitations of the other
(Horowitz, 2004). Horowitz points out that a per-
formance-based measure of visual acuity does not
assess impairments that may be experienced due to
visual field, contrast sensitivity, and depth percep-
tion problems and thus can offer an objective but
more exclusive estimate of visual problems. In con-
trast, she notes that a self-reported measure of visual
ability is likely to capture more global evaluations
of vision, including trouble seeing, difficulty reading
newspaper print, and difficulty seeing a familiar
person across a room's length that provide insight
into the day-to-day implications of poor vision. As
such, self-reported data on visual function are likely
to offer a subjective but more inclusive estimate of
visual problems. Research on other self-reported
aspects of health as measured via global indicators
also supports this idea. For example, self-rated
health is routinely measured using a single global
item. Krause and Jay (1994) found that this stan-
dard self-rated health item taps different dimensions
ranging from general health to specific health behav-
iors. Future research may gain from assessing mul-
tiple aspects of visual function objectively (e.g.,
impairment in depth perception, extreme contrast
or brightness sensitivity in addition to visual acuity
as assessed in NSHAP) and subjectively (e.g., self-
reported trouble with reading newspaper print and
recognizing people at a small distance in addition to
the global assessment of one's vision as assessed in
NSHAP) to more clearly evaluate the direct and
indirect link between vision and its effects on depres-
sive symptomatology.
Our study offers important and new insights to
inform current understanding about the psycho-
logical impact of poor vision. It indicates that the
link between vision and psychological adjustment
in late life is complex rather than simple and mer-
its further investigation. It identifies that the activ-
ity restriction model of depressed affect may offer
a viable explanation for the effects of poor vision--
especially self-reported vision--on adaptation to
this stressor. Based on our findings, we recommend
that clinicians and other health care practitioners
who work with older adults with compromised
visual ability evaluate its impact on their clients'
physical limitations and feelings of social isolation
in addition to the impact on mental health. Multi-
focused clinical and community-based interven-
tions that can maintain or enhance physical and
social functioning levels are also likely to be more
effective in promoting adaptation to poor vision
and better mental health. For example, interven-
tions that focus on making transportation services
available and providing home visits from individ-
uals in the community to assist with daily chores
or engage with the visually impaired socially may
be especially effective for better psychological
adjustment.
Using a nationally representative sample of
community-dwelling older adults increases the sig-
nificance of our findings because of their enhanced
generalizability to the larger population of elders
in the United States. Moreover, the use of objective
and subjective assessments of vision in examining
the psychological impact of poor vision is an
important strength of the study. Despite these
strengths, it should be noted that the data are
cross-sectional in nature and, as such, preclude
causal interpretations of relationships. For exam-
ple, it is plausible that symptoms of depression
contribute to poorer self-rated vision rather than
vice versa or, alternatively, that there is a bidirec-
tional or even cyclical association between these
variables. It is important to note, however, that the
activity restriction model of depressed affect,
which describes that health-related stressors such
as poor vision contribute to depressive symptom-
atology, is a well-established theoretical model in
the realm of adaptation to stress and that this
model provided an excellent fit to the data in the
current study. Another limitation tied to the cross-
sectional nature of the data is that the present
study cannot speak to the issue of vision loss expe-
rienced by the sample because prior levels of vision
are unknown. As such, it is not possible to assess
the extent to which deterioration in vision plays a
role in well-being and the extent to which physical
limitations, driving limitations, and social isola-
tion mediate the impact of such deterioration on
depressive symptomatology. Likewise, the present
data do not allow an examination of the impact of
driving cessation on depressive symptomatology.
As future waves of the NSHAP become available,
however, it will be possible to assess longitudinal
relationships among deterioration in vision, the
resulting loss of function (e.g., the cessation of
driving, decline in physical, and social function-
ing), and psychological adjustment. As indicated
earlier, the current study also was limited in that
only one type of visual ability was assessed objec-
tively, namely visual acuity; the NSHAP did not
include other objective tests of visual function.
However, research has indicated that in addition
to visual acuity, age-related declines are seen in
Vol. 51, No. 6, 2011 807
contrast sensitivity, glare, and visual field tests
(Rubin et al., 1997). The current study also did not
assess the impact of diseases of the eye (e.g., age-
related macular degeneration and glaucoma) that
are known to have an adverse impact on older
adults' quality of life (Crossland, Gould, Helman,
Feely, & Rubin, 2007; Freeman, Munoz, West,
Jampel, & Friedman, 2008). Future research
would benefit from an inclusion of objective per-
formance tests related to various aspects of vision
and a closer examination of the effects of eye dis-
eases when studying the extent to which function-
ing is an intervening variable in the link between
poor vision and depressive symptomatology. In
addition, the present study used feelings of social
isolation as an indicator of social functioning. This
variable has been assessed by other studies on late
life vision (e.g., Femia et al., 2001) and may be the
result of restricted social activities, but it does not
assess social engagement per se. It also should be
noted that the measure of depressive symptomatol-
ogy (the CES-D; Radloff, 1977) relied on self-
report. It may be valuable for future studies to
focus on social engagement specifically and to use
a clinician-based measure of depressive symptom-
atology, such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for
Depression (Hamilton, 1960). Finally, the applica-
bility of the activity restriction model may vary
across different groups (e.g., based on age, gender,
or race), and psychosocial resources are likely to
mitigate the adverse effects of poor vision on psy-
chological adjustment (Bookwala, Resubmitted);
however, these issues were not examined in the
present study. Further research is recommended
on such moderating variables in the psychological
adjustment to poor vision. Despite the limitations
that are noted, the present study is characterized
by several strengths and makes important and
novel contributions to our understanding of the
linkages among vision, physical and social func-
tioning, and depressive symptomatology in late
life.
