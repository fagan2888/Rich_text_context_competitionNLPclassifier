Abstract
The purpose of this research is to examine how transit environments and oth-
er public spaces shape women's and men's victimization for simple assault,
aggravated assault, sexual assault, robbery, and kidnapping crimes. This re-
search applies routine activities theory to examine how everyday activities
shape victimization within these environments. Using data from the Federal
Bureau of Investigations' 2014 National Incident-Based Reporting System,
this research finds that women were more likely to be victimized in certain
spaces such as shopping centers and transit terminals. Regarding certain vio-
lent crimes, it was also discovered that women were more likely to be robbed
at shopping centers, grocery stores, parking lots/garages, and transit termin-
als. It is argued that understanding the vulnerability of simple assault, aggra-
vated assault, sexual assault, robbery, and kidnapping victimization women
have in transit environments and other public spaces may provide useful in-
sight regarding preventing crime in these locations.

1. Introduction
Except for sexual assaults, it is a truism that men suffer more violent victimiza-
tions than women. Consequently, social scientists have neglected gender as a va-
riable of importance in the study of violent crime (Zimring, 2006). The result has
been criminological and victimological research taking on an androcentric tone
that placed importance on men and overlooked crime against women (Cook,

2016). However, more recent research (Lauritsen & Rezey, 2013) acknowledges
the gendered nature of victimization (Gartner, 1990; Marvell & Moody, 1999;
Smith & Brewer, 1992; Smith & Brewer, 1995). Specifically, recent studies have
been conducted on the long-term trends of male and female homicide victimiza-
tion (Batton, 2004; Browne & Williams, 1993; Pizarro, et al., 2010; Pridemore &
Freilich, 2005) as well as non-lethal victimization. To date, most studies that
have examined the gender gap in crime have focused on the long-term trends in
male and female victimization (Langton, et al., 2013). Indeed, this important
body of work has showed that the gender gap in crime is closing regarding vic-
timization, most notably for aggravated and simple assaults (Lauritsen & Heimer
2008).
The aim of this study is to examine the victimization of women in transit en-
vironments and other public spaces that are often found near transit environ-
ments, and how the gender gap in victimization is affected within these spaces.
This is done by comparing 1) the types of crime women are targets of; 2) the
types of public spaces women experience victimization; and 3) how transit envi-
ronments and public spaces shape victimization for women. The present study
uses data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation by examining the victimiza-
tion of women within transit environments and public spaces, and will fill in the
gap of past research that examined the trends in victimization of women and
men. Routine activity theory will be used to explain how transit environments
and public spaces shape victimization differently for women and men in terms
of vulnerability to victimization. This study will explore how victimization varies
within transit environments and public spaces often found adjacent to transit
stops, and the types of crime women are victims of in these environments.
2. Routine Activity Theory
Routine activities theory (RAT) is an influential perspective criminologists use to
study what makes it possible for a criminal event to occur. Cohen and Felson
(1979) explain that there are three necessary conditions for a crime to occur.
Specifically, crimes occur when a motivated offender, a suitable target, and the
lack of a capable guardian come together in time and space. Environmental and
land-use features may influence a motivated offender to victimize a woman in a
parking lot with a connected bus stop (Loukaitou-Sideris, 1999).
The term "suitable target" was purposefully chosen by Cohen and Felson
(1979) rather than "victim" because they wanted to include property as targets of
crime, in addition to people. The term "capable guardian" was chosen over police
because informal guardians such as members of the public can also provide guar-
dianship. Therefore, bystanders who happen to be around when the crime is being
committed can be more effective capable guardians than the police, insofar as they
are present when the crime takes place (Savard, Kelley, & Merolla, 2017).
An important aspect of RAT regards the convergence of the three concepts
described above in time and space. This convergence occurs in the routine activ-
ities of people as they go about their lives. Therefore, much of crime is a mun-
D. M. Savard
DOI: 10.4236/aasoci.2018.81004 58 Advances in Applied Sociology
dane phenomenon that occurs during everyday life, rather than in exciting and
abnormal circumstances. Cohen and Felson (1979) argued that predatory type
crimes were increasing in the United States in post-World War II because people
were venturing out of the household more, and leaving property unattended,
unlike in past time periods.
3. Research on Transit Environments and Other Public Spaces
The American Public Transportation Association in 2015 reported that 653 U.S.
public transportation systems operated buses in urban environments and 525
operated buses in rural areas. Undoubtedly, many of the routes taken by these
buses had stops at or near shopping malls, grocery stores, universities, and
parking lots/garages. This same association reports that for the third of Ameri-
cans who resided in rural communities, public transportation was vital for them
in terms of having access to education, shopping, entertainment, and employ-
ment. In fact, it was reported that 12% of public transportation users (e.g., bus
riders) in 2013 used public transportation to get to and from school, such as a
university. In other words, public transit users may have to rely solely on public
transportation thereby rendering them "transit captives" because they have no
other means of traveling when performing routine activities. Because females
have been identified as using public transit at higher rates (Yu & Smith, 2014),
they may have a higher risk of victimization in transit environments based on
offenders' perceptions of vulnerability and target suitability. The nexus of per-
ceived vulnerabilities with transit environments in areas experiencing social dis-
organization (Shaw & McKay, 1972) can exacerbate an already increased risk of
victimization. It may be that women are more vulnerable to victimization based
on perpetrators' perceptions of women being a "suitable target."Female robbers,
for example, have been found to purposely target female victims because they
view them as more vulnerable and least likely to resist (Miller, 1998).
Some universities have bus lines dedicated to the thousands of university stu-
dents, faculty, and staff to relieve crowding and reduce parking costs. The
American Public Transportation Association (2007) also reports that strategi-
cally placing residential and commercial development near public transportation
is a growing practice. This practice is referred to as Transit-Oriented Develop-
ment where housing, shopping, educational institutions, and employment are
within reasonable walking distance to public transportation. Indeed, practices
such as these coalesce shopping centers, grocery stores, universities, and parking
lots/ garages with transit environments. This is important because research has
shown a concentration of bus stops can have an impact on the overall crime rate
in the surrounding area (Kooi, 2013). Research has also found that some public
locations such as schools (Roman, 2005), parking lots (Laycock & Austin, 1992),
and shopping malls (Brantingham et al., 1990; Savard & Kennedy, 2014) can
have an impact on the overall crime rate for adjacent public spaces.
Transit environments and public spaces, such as bus stops, shopping centers
and grocery stores, can provide for the coming together of a motivated offender,
D. M. Savard
DOI: 10.4236/aasoci.2018.81004 59 Advances in Applied Sociology
suitable target, and lack of a capable of guardian where the motivated offender
may not be deterred because of his or her rationalizations of the number of vic-
tims and the likelihood of not being apprehended for lack of capable guardians.
Public locations may serve as a "critical intensity zone" wherein there are
enough suitable targets to attract motivated offenders but not enough capable
guardians to deter them (Angel, 1968; Block & Block, 2000). The bystander effect
and a desire for anonymity by citizens may also contribute to the victimization
of suitable targets in public spaces (Chekroun & Brauer, 2002). Fear of crime in
these settings can influence the routine activities of people as well (Ceccato,
2016; Ceccato, 2014; Loukaitou-Sideris, 2014; Madan & Nalla, 2016; Wiebe, et
al., 2014). In addition to this fear of crime, people may expect to experience an
unpleasant event, such as observing a suicide on train tracks, while using the
services of a railway station (Shibata, et al., 2014). Transit environments within
public spaces can also serve as crime generators (Brantingham & Brantingham,
1995). Crime generators are spaces offenders are attracted to, but do not have
inherent criminogenic characteristics. Therefore, transit environments situated
in or adjacent to certain public spaces can attract potential perpetrators.
Transit environments may also foster offenders' journey to crime (Phillips,
1980), but research has found little support that public transportation introduces
non-residential offenders to new hunting grounds (Sedelmaier, 2014). Crime at-
tractors, on the other hand, produce crime in and of themselves because of the
nature of their environment. Therefore, bus stops located near crime attracting
environments such as bars, vacant/abandoned buildings, and derelict motels can
contribute to a criminogenic environment where people are waiting for buses and
consequently victimized (Loukaitou-Sideris, 1999). Because street robberies can
cluster in time and space and occur in high traffic areas such as transit terminals
(Glasner & Leitner, 2016) and areas surrounding bus stops have been identified as
having higher rates of violent victimizations (Block & Davis, 1996; Caplan, et al.,
2012), the concept of near-repeat victimization based on the closeness transit
environments have to high risk locations can exacerbate an already criminogenic
environment that are "risky facilities" to begin with (Clarke & Eck, 2007).
However, research has identified a higher likelihood of robbery victimization
when a bus stop is located near an ATM compared to only an ATM, but a lower
risk of robbery victimization when a bus stop is located near a bar compared to
only a bar (Hart & Miethe, 2014). Robbers tend to commit robberies in places
that fall within their routine travels and are close to their homes. The idea is that
robbers are not only more comfortable with operating in places they routinely
travel, but they may be aware of security measures meant to stop them before a
robbery is committed or apprehend them after a robbery is committed. There-
fore, not only will robbers rationally choose to prey upon women because of
their perceived vulnerable state, but will rationally pick an area close to their
home because this increases their chances of successfully victimizing women and
decreases their chances of being caught (Wright & Decker, 1997). Certainly, the
D. M. Savard
DOI: 10.4236/aasoci.2018.81004 60 Advances in Applied Sociology
number of women and men who occupy any one location needs to be consi-
dered when examining the situational contexts of criminal victimization, but
perceived vulnerabilities from the perspective of the perpetrator can start to ex-
plain why women may be more likely to be victimized in transit environments.
4. Gendered Nature of Spaces
Gender expectations and the femininity and masculinity attached to gender help
produce the creation of gendered spaces such as the workplace and community
(Spain, 1992). It is not so much a gendered space by its very nature as it is con-
sidered a gendered space based on the feminine and masculine behaviors per-
formed by women and men. In other words, behaviors at grocery stores and
shopping malls are influenced by ideas of femininity and masculinity and what it
means to be a woman or man. As people go about their routine activities
throughout the day, they travel to and visit places which are designated spaces
for men and women. Gender is intimately tied to society and has a profound
impact on how males and females act in particular social contexts. Therefore,
shopping for clothes or groceries has feminine and masculine qualities attached
to them. Gendered spaces are dependent upon what society says is appropriate
behavior for women and men and this determines if the behaviors performed at
each respective location are considered feminine or masculine. Societal expecta-
tions as they relate to gender heavily influence individuals' routine activities. In
turn, broad social structural patterns influence violent victimization. For exam-
ple, macro-historical events and how women and men come to occupy certain
spaces in society can explain how victimization is place based and translates into
potential dangerous spaces. Specifically, women occupy these spaces because of
structural forces and historical influences, and consequently may be at a partic-
ular risk of criminal victimization in such spaces. However, the increased risk of
victimization is not linked to the behaviors being performed in each respective
gendered space; rather, it may be that women are more vulnerable to victimiza-
tion based on perpetrators' perceptions of women being a "suitable target."It
could be the gendered nature of grocery stores and shopping centers that con-
tribute to the number of women and men who occupy them where the prepon-
derance of women and men occupying such spaces place them at an increased
risk of victimization based on vulnerability (Savard, Kelley, & Merolla, 2017).
5. Hypotheses
Hypothesis 1: It is expected that females will be more likely than males to be vic-
timized in transit terminals, shopping centers, grocery stores, parking lot/garages,
and universities.
Hypothesis 2: It is expected that females will be more likely than males to be
the victim of a simple assault in transit terminals, shopping centers, grocery
stores, parking lot/garages, and universities.
Hypothesis 3: It is expected that females will be more likely than males to be
D. M. Savard

the victim of an aggravated assault in transit terminals, shopping centers, gro-
cery stores, parking lot/garages, and universities.
Hypothesis 4: It is expected that females will be more likely than males to be
the victim of a robbery in transit terminals, shopping centers, grocery stores,
parking lot/garages, and universities.
6. Data and Methods
The present study will use data from the National Incident-Based Reporting
System (NIBRS) for the year 2014. Unlike the Uniform Crime Reporting System
(UCR) which collects data at the aggregate level, the NIBRS collects incident-
level data. Furthermore, the NIBRS expands the level of collection by including
46 Group A Offenses, whereas the level of collection by the UCR only includes
eight Index offenses (Addington, 2007). A major advantage of the NIBRS is that
the victim type is identified (i.e., individual or business) and victims' demo-
graphic information is also collected. The location of where the incident oc-
curred is also collected in the NIBRS.
The purpose for conducting this project is to analyze data of simple assaults,
aggravated assaults, robberies, sexual assaults, and kidnappings that occur in
transit terminals and other public locations. A major goal of this study is to ex-
amine if the study variable locations are related to the gender gap in victimiza-
tions. For example, there were 451,712 simple assaults, 93,606 aggravated as-
saults, 44,395 sexual assaults, 21,378 robberies, and 8935 kidnappings reported
in the 2014 NIBRS data. Of these numbers, females represented 65.1% of simple
assault victims, 49.4% of aggravated assault victims, 86.9% of sexual assault vic-
tims, 33.6% of robbery victims, and 83.9% of kidnapping victims. Notwith-
standing simple assaults, sexual assaults, and kidnappings, more men than
women were aggravated assault and robbery victims. This research project will
hypothesize that the likelihood of female victimization will be greater when ex-
amined in the context of transit environments and other public locations.
7. Measures
7.1. Dependent Variable
All of the variables in the study will include a series of dummy variables. Gender
will represent the one dependent variable in this study. Gender will be coded as a
dummy variable, with males coded as 0 and females coded as 1. Unfortunately,
the data does not allow for examining other gender categories, such as trans-
gendered individuals. The use of female as a dependent variable is not to predict
gender. The study is using characteristics of a crime to discover the likelihood
that the victim is male or female.1
1Each case in the data represents a criminal incident. The gender variable in the dataset represents a
person who was either a female victim or male victim. Therefore, within a given incident, the models
are examining what the likelihood is that the victim is female or male. The models are not predicting
their gender. For example, if one could imagine a large silo that contains crime victims, what would
be the likelihood that we would pull out a female victim or male victim?
D. M. Savard

7.2. Independent Variables
Target suitability will be operationalized using the victim's age and time of day.
Age of victim was coded into four separate dummy variables: 18 - 29, 30 - 49, 50
- 64, and 65+. The reference category will be victims 17 years of age and young-
er. Time of day was coded into three separate dummy variables: 7 a.m. to 11
a.m., 12 p.m. to 4 p.m., and 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. The reference category will be 12
a.m. to 6 a.m.
Perceptions that a victim or a law enforcement officer has regarding if an of-
fender was using alcohol or drugs will be used to operationalize offender moti-
vation. Routine activity theory assumes that offenders are rational beings who
weigh the costs relative to the benefits before committing a crime. Therefore, an
offender not under the influence of alcohol or drugs may be more effective in
terms of evaluating the presence of capable guardians, particularly in public lo-
cations. Motivated offenders not inhibited by alcohol or drug use may be more
likely to seek out environments where a pool of suitable targets is available. It is
predicted that offenders who are under the influence of alcohol or drugs will be
less likely to commit crimes against women.
Guardianship will be operationalized using one indicator, where the incident
took place. NIBRS provides a comprehensive list of locations where criminal
events took place.2 Five public locations will be examined: grocery stores, shop-
ping centers, parking lots, universities, and transit terminals. Location will in-
clude five dummy variables: grocery store (0 = No, 1 = Yes), shopping center (0
= No, 1 = Yes), parking lot (0 = No, 1 = Yes), university (0 = No, 1 = Yes) and
transit terminal (0 = No, 1 = Yes). Notwithstanding transit terminals, the loca-
tion variables were chosen to be included in the analysis because it is not un-
common to find transit terminals, such as bus stops, located at or adjacent to
them.
There will be a number of control variables in the study, along with a number
of interactions. The victim's race will be a control measure by using two dummy
variables, black and white, with other race serving as the reference category. The
relationship that the victim has with the perpetrator will include three dummy
variables: stranger, intimate partner, and acquaintance. The reference category
will be other family. There will be a total of five crimes that will be examined in
this study: simple assault (0 = No, 1 = Yes), aggravated assault (0 = No, 1 = Yes),
robbery (0 = No, 1 = Yes), sexual assault (0 = No, 1 = Yes), and kidnapping (0 =
No, 1 = Yes). There is a total of four values that will be used to constitute the
sexual assault variable.
2There are many locations identified in NIBRS data. These locations include but are not limited to:
1) home; 2) bank; 3) bar; 4) alley; 5) church; 6) prison; and 7) playground. In addition to transit ter-
minals, I chose shopping centers, grocery stores, parking lot/garages, and universities as study va-
riables because of the number of bus stops that are located at or near these locations. For example, it
is not uncommon for local municipalities to have ordinances/laws that require private properties
give access to public transportation (see Center for Urban Transportation Research, (2009), Public
Transit Access to Private Property, January 2009.).

8. Analytic Strategy
Logistic regression will be the statistical technique utilized in this research
project. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) will be used for all
analyses. Logistic regression is the preferred statistical technique when depen-
dent variables are categorical in nature. As was described above, the dependent
variable in this study is dichotomous. Because the dependent variable is com-
prised of two categories, the quantitative data will be analyzed using logistic re-
gression. When the dependent variable is dichotomous and not continuous in
nature, the logistic regression model allows for estimations of the coefficient that
measure the effect predictor variables have on an outcome variable (Bachman &
Paternoster, 2009). Pearson's correlation coefficients were used a priori to ex-
amine potential issues of multicollinearity.
9. Results
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the study variables. Interestingly,
over half of the crime victims in the study were women. It might be expected
that men would have a higher percentage of criminal victimization in the dataset
based on ideas of victimization and who is more likely to be victimized, but the
NIBRS reports that more women than men are victims of crime. However, it is
important to point out that men are still more likely to suffer violent acts of
crime, such as robbery and aggravated assaults. A possible reason for this dis-
parity in crime victimization rates is that the NIBRS is a different measure of
crime and reports more different types of crime when compared to the UCR, so
this might serve as an explanation as to why more women are victims of crime in
the NIBRS.
The variables measuring target suitability includes victim's age, the time of
day in which the crime occurred, and if the offender was perceived to have been
under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. A not insignificant number of
crimes were perpetrated against individuals in the different age categories. Spe-
cifically, 34.1% of crime victims were between 18 - 29 years of age, 36.8% were
between 30 - 49 years of age, 11.8% were between 50 - 64 years of age, and ap-
proximately 2.3% were 65+ years of age. With respect to the first two age catego-
ries, these results are not surprising findings because these age categories are
more likely to visit places outside of the home when compared to other age cat-
egories. Also, it may be that people in these age ranges are more likely to travel
outside of the home. Criminals may view women as suitable targets not just be-
cause they are alone when visiting places outside of the home, but because they
are viewed as more vulnerable and therefore unable to thwart any predatory at-
tacks, such as a sexual assault. 16.2% of the crime victimizations occurred from 7
a.m. to 11 a.m., 24.4% occurred from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m., and 39.6% occurred
from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m., respectively.
The locations used in the present study to measure guardianship had a rela-
tively low base rate. In other words, both women and men are more likely to be

victimized in other locations. Even with these low base rates, it is still important
to examine victimization in these spaces because, as it will be demonstrated be-
low, when individuals are victimized in these locations, it is more likely to in-
volve women with respect to certain situational contexts. 3.8% of crime occurred
at parking lot/garages, 0.57% of crimes occurred at shopping centers, 0.33% of
D. M. Savard

crime occurred at grocery stores, 0.29% of crime occurred at transit terminals,
and 0.32% of crime occurred at universities. The first crime type, simple assault,
consisted of about 60% of the total amount of crime. 12.4% of the sample in-
cluded aggravated assaults, about 6% of the sample included sexual assaults,
about 3% of the sample included robberies, and kidnapping made up about 1%
of the sample. When looking at victim's race, about 68% of the crime victims in
the study were white and about 30% of the sample consisted of black victims.
Regarding the nature of the relationship between the victim and perpetrator,
about 36% of the samples were victimized by an intimate partner, about 22%
were victimized by an acquaintance, and about 9% were victimized by a stranger.
The results of the logistic regression analysis models predicting variation in
the likelihood that women will suffer victimization in public spaces is presented
in Table 2. First, it was predicted that the indicators of target suitability (time of
day and victim's age) would be significantly and positively associated with the
likelihood that women would be victimized. In other words, and according to
RAT, it would be expected that women would be more likely to be victimized
during the morning, afternoon, and evening hours. Furthermore, it would be
expected that women in each respective age category would be more likely to be
victimized compared to the reference group. According to Model 1, women 18 -
29 years old, 30 - 49 years old, and 65+ are significantly more likely to be victi-
mized. When a crime occurs between 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. to 4 p.m.,
women are significantly more likely to be the victim of a crime. The indicator
used to measure offender motivation was if the offender was perceived to be
under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. The results indicate that women are
approximately 8% less likely to be victimized by an offender who was perceived
to be under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. If women are less likely to be
victimized in public locations where the incident can potentially be observed by
capable guardians, motivated offenders may view women as suitable targets
based on perceptions of vulnerability and choose to commit their crimes while
not under the influence because they do not want their mental state to be inhi-
bited. This is not to suggest that women are inherently more vulnerable to victi-
mization compared to men; rather, motivated offenders may perceive them to be
vulnerable. Location of the crime was the one indicator used to measure guar-
dianship. Women are significantly more likely to be victimized at shopping cen-
ters and transit terminals. However, women are about 17% less likely to be vic-
timized in a parking lot/garage and are about 11% less likely to be victimized at a
university. No significant findings were discovered for grocery stores. Therefore,
Hypothesis 1 was partially supported.
Hypothesis 2 predicts that women will be more likely to suffer a simple assault
in the study location variables. These hypotheses were tested using Model 2 of
Table 2. According to Model 2, women were less likely to suffer a simple assault
at grocery stores, parking lots/garages, and universities. No significant findings
were discovered for shopping centers and transit terminals. Therefore, Hypothe-
sis 2 was not supported.

Hypothesis 3 predicts females will be significantly more likely to suffer aggra-
vated assault victimizations in each of the study location variables. It was found
that women were less likely to suffer aggravated assault victimizations at grocery
stores and universities, and no significant findings were discovered for the re-
maining locations. Therefore, Hypothesis 3 was not supported.
Regarding robbery victimizations, women were significantly more likely to be
robbed at shopping centers, grocery stores, parking lots/garages, and transit
terminals. Therefore, Hypothesis 4 was mainly supported. With respect to the
crime of robbery, this finding supports the study's claim that transit environ-
ments and public spaces shape victimization differently for women and men in
terms of vulnerability to victimization. Model 1 indicates that there is a strong
negative main effect for robbery victimization, but when robberies are examined
in the context of shopping centers, grocery stores, parking lots/garages, and
transit terminals; we see that the gender gap in robbery victimization flips where
women are more likely to be robbed.
10. Discussion
The gender gap in crime explains that men and women experience criminal vic-
D. M. Savard
DOI: 10.4236/aasoci.2018.81004 68 Advances in Applied Sociology
timization differently. Crime statistics, particularly those from governmental
sources, consistently show that men outnumber women as suffering violent acts
of crime. The one exception to this is that women are much more likely to suffer
rapes. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to suffer aggravated assaults,
robberies, and murder. Researchers have studied trends in the gender gap in
crime and observed that this crime gap is starting to close. However, the closing
of this gap is the result of men's victimization rates dropping and women's vic-
timization rates remaining stable over time (Lauritsen & Heimer 2008). The
current study investigated this gap in the research by attempting to use the ideas
of routine activity theory (RAT) to understand how men and women experience
victimization in different situational contexts.
Drawing upon insights from Cohen and Felson (1979), criminal victimization
can be explained as occurring during individuals' routine activities as they got
about their day, and can further be shaped by the interrelatedness of certain
spaces. The idea is that women will be more vulnerable in these spaces because
offenders view them as suitable targets. It was found that the odds of women
being victimized in some public spaces were greater than men. Individuals' rou-
tine activities generally take place in the morning to late evening hours. The re-
sults indicate that women were more likely to be victimized during times when
people are more active in public locations.
From a practical standpoint, a related perspective associated with RAT is
Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED). The tenets of
CPTED can be implemented in an effort to prevent and deter crime from occur-
ring in the study's location variables. This perspective assumes that there is a
symbiotic relationship between the environment and human behavior, and ma-
nipulating the environment will also alter human behavior (Newman, 1973). Bus
stops situated in shopping centers, for example, invoke natural surveillance.
Natural surveillance consists of designing the natural environment to allow
people to freely overlook a property and have clear sightlines to potentially ob-
serve criminal activity. Bus stops located at or near shopping mall parking lots
bring people together on a consistent basis at all hours of the day and night, and
efficient designs of these locations can go a long way in helping prevent crimes.
This is particularly important when considering the study's findings on robbery
victimization in public spaces. Hypothesis 4 A-E predicted that women were
more likely to be robbed in each of the study's location variables. Model 1 of Ta-
ble 2 shows a strong negative effect for robbery victimizations, but when rob-
bery is examined in transit environments, for example, women start becoming
significantly more likely to be robbery victims.
The interactions of robbery victimization by location show that the difference
in this type of crime is smaller in transit terminals, shopping malls, grocery
stores, and parking lots/garages. The study predicted that women would have a
greater likelihood of suffering robbery victimization in transit environments and
other public spaces. Notwithstanding universities, support for using routine ac-
D. M. Savard

tivity theory as a theoretical explanation of how women and men experience vic-
timization in transit environments and other public spaces is particularly ob-
served in robbery victimizations.
Oftentimes, large regional shopping centers have enormous parking lots to
accommodate the thousands of people who patronize them every day, and con-
sequently the design of these parking lots can create desolate environments.
Public transportation can have an iatrogenic effect in that travelers are brought
to locations where they can potentially be victimized. Therefore, a woman tra-
versing a shopping mall parking after being dropped off at a bus stop may be
victimized by a motivated offender operating with impunity because of a lack of
capable guardians. Conversely, it also may be that a motivated offender utilizing
public transportation victimizes a shopping mall patron in a parking lot. Indeed,
public transportation can influence both victim and offending rates within the
context of public locations. Paying attention to lighting, implementing patrolling
security guards, and operating CCTV may help with altering human behavior
and ultimately prevent crime (Savard & Kennedy, 2014). However, the effec-
tiveness of lighting may only be good insofar as it prevents specific types of
crimes and not crimes in general (Farrington & Welsh, 2002), whereas the effi-
cacy of patrolling security guards and CCTV regarding their deterrent value
have been challenged (Telep & Weisburd, 2012; Welsh & Farrington, 2002).
Speaking from the RAT perspective, visiting public spaces occurs during the
routine, mundane activities that women and men engage in on an everyday ba-
sis. The ideas of RAT were used to examine specific crime type victimizations in
public spaces. When the crime of robbery is examined, the results indicate that
women have higher odds of robbery victimization in all but one of the public
spaces. Women were less likely to suffer robbery victimizations in general, but
when looking at the situational dynamics of the crime, women are more likely to
be robbed in shopping centers, grocery stores, parking lots/garages, and termin-
als. Robbers can be rational thinkers when committing their crimes because
prior research has found that they target victims who seem vulnerable and do
not pose any threats (Felson & Messner, 1996). The crime selection type of an
offender can be critical in terms of preventing crime in public spaces. For exam-
ple, robbery is generally not a crime type selected at random by an offender. The
rational robber will be careful to look for escape routes when evaluating the sui-
tability of a target and guardians who can offer protection. If offenders are ra-
tional beings and weigh the costs and benefits before they choose to commit a
robbery, security measures such as enhanced lighting and random security pa-
trols may act as a deterrent. A threefold method can be used by increasing the
levels of personnel on buses to deter a robbery, having alarms on buses to thwart
a robbery, and placing locating systems on buses to apprehend a robbery suspect
(Hoel, 1992).
Implementing security measures (e.g., security guards, upgraded lighting,
CCTV) within transit environments may help alleviate any inherent risks of vic-
D. M. Savard
DOI: 10.4236/aasoci.2018.81004 70 Advances in Applied Sociology
timization, but some transit environments may be more receptive to security
measures in terms of preventing crime. The ideas of prospect, refuge, and escape
proposed by Fisher and Nasar (1992) can help explain why crime may be more
likely to occur in some transit environments compared to others. Prospect refers
to being able to scan a space without obstruction, refuge refers to being able to
identify safe harbor, and escape refers to being able to exit a space. Indeed, these
concepts have practical implications for the security and safety of transit envi-
ronments and other public locations. For example, a motivated offender may be
able to more effectively surveil a bus stop location, take refuge after committing
a crime, and ultimately flee the area more effectively compared to an under-
ground station. In other words, bus stops provide an environment conducive to
predation based on the concepts above, whereas underground stations may limit
a motivated offender's choices in terms of identifying a suitable target because
this environment improves guardianship (Uittenbogaard, 2014). Security practi-
tioners can take advantage of the symbiotic relationship that exists between hu-
man behavior and the unique features of some transit environments where secu-
rity measures may be more effective and guardianship improved (Savard &
Kennedy, 2013). However, risks associated with theft and terrorism (e.g., biolog-
ical and chemical agents) are always present in underground subway systems
because of available targets and the construction of these spaces (Newton, et al.,
2014).
In addition to solving specific crime problems in the community through a
problem-oriented response (Goldstein, 1990), another tactic grounded within a
legal framework is being utilized by law enforcement as a third-party approach.
Third party policing is a method where policing agencies and local governments
work together to encourage properties that have been deemed a nuisance within
the community to address issues of crime (Mazerolle & Ransley, 2006). For ex-
ample, law enforcement and local municipal governments can use nuisance ab-
atement laws to force unwillingly problematic properties to deal with issues of
crime on their property (O'Connor, 1977). In other words, civil remedies in the
form of regulations and statutes can be used as a method of crime prevention
(Mazerolle & Roehl, 1998). Indeed, businesses being threatened with daily fines
may be an effective way to motivate them to deal with issues on their properties.
Therefore, the use of third party policing can be used for properties adjacent to
transportation hubs that are contributing to the overall crime rate in the area by
holding "place managers" partially responsible for the criminogenic environ-
ment (Eck, 1994; Eck & Wartell, 1998; Madensen & Eck, 2008; Mazerolle, et al.,
1998; Sampson, et al., 2010). Another area in which third parties can be held ac-
countable for crime on their properties is the use of expert witnesses in civil
lawsuits. "Social science in law" can be used as a "social framework" to explain
the potential culpability or innocence of a property owner for a criminal victi-
mization that occurred on his or her property (Monahan & Walker, 1990;
Walker & Monahan, 1987).

11. Limitations
The data used in this study is not without its limitations because it provides li-
mited coverage and consequently is not representative of all police departments
across the United States. For example, of the 33 states that reported crime data
via the NIBRS in 2014, all law enforcement agencies in 16 of the 33 states sub-
mitted their crime data using the NIBRS (FBI, 2014). Even though the NIBRS
improves upon the UCR by eliminating the Hierarchy Rule, problems associated
with unreported crime or the "dark figure of crime" remains an issue for the
NIBRS. Indeed, crime is brought to the attention of the police in two ways, ei-
ther they observe it themselves or it is brought to their attention by the citizenry.
Consequently, issues of validity and reliability can be a problem for crime data
that is relied on being reported by law enforcement agencies. Even with these
limitations, researchers are starting to utilize and analyze NIBRS data in their
research (Savard, Kelley, & Merolla, 2017; Tillyer & Tillyer, 2014).
Another limitation of the study is the NIBRS's inability to allow for the identi-
fication of a bus stop, for example, at or near a shopping center. Consequently,
there is no way to determine if the risk of victimization for women is greater at a
bus stop located near a shopping center compared to a stand-alone bus stop lo-
cated on a city street. It could be that stand-alone bus stops are more dangerous
for riders based on their isolation from nearby businesses, such as shopping
centers and grocery stores. Future research should distinguish between transit
environments located at or near businesses and those that are solitary in nature.
NIBRS also does not consider the "environmental backcloth" of transit envi-
ronments (Brantingham & Brantingham, 1993). Therefore, future studies should
account for the differences between transit environments and public spaces
based on their location, history, users, and how security measures are perceived
(Savard & Kennedy, 2014). Examining the unique environmental characteristics
of transit environments may allow for a more detailed understanding of victi-
mization risk.
12. Conclusion
It is generally accepted among criminological and victimological researchers that
men outnumber women as being victims of crime, particularly violent crime.
Researchers have started to challenge this generalized thinking by examining the
gender differentiated trends in victimization. The study argues that this line of
thinking has the potential to allow for a better understanding of the situational
dynamics of criminal victimization among the genders. Using the RAT perspec-
tive provides a theoretical lens through which the gender gap in crime can be
viewed in transit environments. This theory allows for examining how everyday
activities of people shape their victimization in transit environments and public
spaces. Overall, the study's findings generally supported the perspective that the
gender gap in crime is impacted by routine activities within transit environ-
ments and the propinquity of public spaces.
