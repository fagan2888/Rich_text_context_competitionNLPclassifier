Introduction: Aims and Scope of the
Research
Subcultural accounts of working-class youth have shown
that school underachievement was not a problem for their
identity construction. They could cultivate anti-school val-
ues and create oppositional cultures within which they could
accrue social capital and forge a respectable adolescent iden-
tity simply because opportunity structures in the old days
could assure them a safe and stable passage into working-
class jobs (Hagan, 1997; Jackson, 2002; Kelly, 2009;
Martino, 1994; Sullivan, 1989; Wexler, 1992; Willis, 1977).
Despite the fact that they had to face educational exclusion
and disrespect in their teen years, working-class adolescents'
identities were protected against this social exclusion due to
the power of their resistant culture and to the fact that they
could safely plan their transition into manual jobs (Clarke,
Jefferson, & Roberts, 1975; Chu, Porche, & Tolman, 2005;
Francis, 1999a; Mac an Ghaill, 1994; Swain, 2003; Thornton,
1995)
In the last 30 years, youth sociology researchers tend to
subscribe a kind of paradigm shift regarding identity forma-
tion of working-class adolescents. Radical transformations in
the job market are so overwhelming for working-class youth
that direct transition into traditional manual jobs has been
made an unattainable dream. Stemming from what has been
called "risk-individualization thesis," the dominant argu-
ment that youth scholars seem to subscribe holds that, even
if social inequalities remain intact and pervasive as in the old
days, working-class adolescents are forced to reflect upon
their post high school options in individual terms and to
become the authors of their narratives all by themselves,
without resorting to class ties or to oppositional cultures
(Andres & Wyn, 2010; Beck & Beck-Gernsheim, 2002;
Bennett, 2000; Biggart & Walther, 2006; Du Bois-Reymond,
1998)
In the remaining of the article, we aim at forging an argu-
ment on how vocational adolescents of our days shape their
self-narratives and take decisions on their life transitions by
focusing on the interplay of social class and biographical
contexts within which these decisions are made. Two basic
assumptions frame our line of reasoning. First, how adoles-
cents reconstruct their biographical life events is not struc-
turally determined, but it is something that takes place in
specific life-world contexts which have to be thoroughly

Ambivalent Biographies in Adolescence:
What Vocational Students Think and Feel
About Their Schooling
Pandelis Kiprianos1 and Michael Christodoulou1
Abstract
Despite the fact that vocational adolescents are in a disadvantaged position regarding their post-secondary high school
routes, research has highlighted the resistant and innovative ways they set in motion so as to grapple with their estranging
schooling experiences. Our article aims to contribute to this research area by focusing on how adolescents' narration of
their schooling frames their life planning. In particular, we explore a major finding of our research--namely, their defending
of vocational training--by means of the notion of ambivalent biographical identity. We argue (a) that today's adolescents do
not openly reject vocational training, and they try to transform the unofficial skills and knowledge obtained in their cultures
into official cultural capital capable of making them enter the job market and (b) that their life planning is tied up with a
biographical identity formation through which they try to coherently reconcile their embodied cultures with the vocational
qualifications they aspire to acquire.

analyzed should one wish to understand when and to what
extent agency or structure prevails in his or her life transi-
tions, and second, how they narrate their turning points and
construct their biographical identities seems to be a crucial
factor regarding the framing of their life decisions.
Literature Review and Research
Questions
Research on how self-formation of working-class adoles-
cents affects their life transitions shows that in our days, they
are exposed to an array of vocational and training options
which make them be more reflective about their post-second-
ary routes. However, it is a kind of reflexivity of which the
dynamic is extremely forged by and through social forces.
Research conclusions could be summed up as following: (a)
decision making should not be seen as grounded on a rational
planning but on what is called pragmatistic rationality, mean-
ing that it is not the psychological or developmental tasks
that guide adolescents' decisions but it is the context-spe-
cific, practical and partial character of their everyday life that
shapes the criteria for their post-secondary transitions
(Hodkinson & Sparkes, 1997; Hodkinson, Sparkes, &
Hodkinsin, 1996; Irwin, 1995); (b) working-class adoles-
cents' agency is bounded by the restricted cultural capital of
their parents who are not able to contribute to their planning
and by the limited opportunity structure that the local job
markets offer them and which tie them up with their geo-
graphical location (Bynner & Roberts, 1991; Evans, 2002;
Southerton, 2002); (c) they are more prone to trust not the
official or "cold" knowledge of school authorities but the
informal and "hot" knowledge of their social networks (Ball
& Vincent, 1998; Horvat, Weininger, & Lareau, 2003;
Leonard, 2005); and (d) working-class origin of adolescents
should not be seen as an independent variable that deter-
mines life transition but that it is the decisive role of school-
ing experiences that mediates their job aspirations (Ball,
Davies, David, & Reay, 2002; Lucey & Reay, 2000; McLeod
& Yates, 2006).
Despite its contribution to how vocational adolescents
make decisions regarding their job careers, the above-men-
tioned research presents some gaps, which we believe
deserve thorough discussion. First of all, in some cases,
explanations seem to resort to a kind of habitus determinism,
as it is either negative schooling experiences which make
vocational adolescents have poor job aspirations (Sletten,
2011) or parents' poor emotional capital which makes them
believe in interpersonal information regarding their job
options (Foskett & Hemsley-Brown, 1999; West & Ribbens,
1994). Second, despite the fact that vocational adolescents
are called to become the authors of their narratives due to the
multiple and risky options they face, proponents of "risk-
individualization" thesis do not provide us with a clear theo-
retical proposition which could frame the end product of this
self-narration. In other words, we are told half of the story--
not how it ends in theoretical terms (Foskett & Hesketh,
1997). Finally, there is a tendency to approach vocational
adolescents'life decisions in disembodied terms, that is, as if
their decision making is a discursive matter disconnected
from their system of relevance (Francis, 1999b).
Our research comes to deal with these gaps by focusing
on the cognitive, emotional, and embodied dimensions which
frame working-class adolescents life planning and on how
identity formation process is tied up with their schooling
experiences and with their post-secondary routes. In particu-
lar, we are going to explore (a) the evaluations and represen-
tations these pupils hold in relation to their choice to pursue
vocational schooling, (b) the vocabulary of motives (Mills,
1940) they use for constructing (and construing) their sense
of self and others, and (c) the ways the above two parameters
are inscribed in their life-world conditions and give shape to
their post-secondary ambitions.
Theoretical Underpinnings of the
Research
In framing the above questions, we adopted two core ideas
from Bourdieu's theory of habitus and from research on nar-
rative identity. According to Bourdieu and some commenta-
tors (Bourdieu, 1990; Crossley, 2001), the sense of self is
shaped through one's involvement into what his or her life-
world considers as valuable and practically relevant. Social
interaction and familiarization of the actor with the classifi-
cations and typifications of the group within which he or she
grows up are the reasons why he or she comes to see some
life options as self-evident and others as unthinkable.
Actions are put in motion by means of actor's embodied
habituation with what his or her social situation enables him
or her to do or not (Crossley, 2006; Csordas, 1990; Hewitt,
2003; Jackson, 1983; Throop & Murphy, 2002; Waquant,
2014).
Although habitus can effectively tap the taken-for-grant-
edness of actor's everyday life and the social grounding of
his or her orientations, biographical identity is a term used to
capture the narrative ways he or she implements to meaning-
fully analyze how his or her past life-world experiences are
connected with present self-conceptions (Bruner, 1991;
Maines, 1993; Riessman, 2008; Somers, 1994). It is not only
through narratives that actors cohere biographical life events
but also they claim an identity related to how they became
what they are and to how they want to be conceived by others
(Spector-Mersel, 2011). Actors, by looking back at what they
have been through and looking forward to what they aspire
to be, produce narratives through which they can coherently
cope with their psychologically painful life experiences by
drawing upon the stock of knowledge of the social worlds of
which these narratives are a part of (Fischer-Rosenthal, 2000;
McAdams, 2008, 2011).

Methodological Considerations
Sampling Choices
Our sample strategy was designed according to the logic of
"maximum variation purposeful sampling" (Miles &
Huberman, 1994), that is, we recruited vocational adolescents
taking into account, besides social class origin, the location of
the school and the social attributes of adolescents' neighbor-
hood so as to compare data drawn from vocational adolescents
who have different socializing experiences. The goal of our
research design was twofold. In particular, we wanted to pres-
ent a quantitative picture of how vocational adolescents evalu-
ate their option to enroll in vocational school after the
completion of junior high school. In addition, we aimed at dig-
ging into how local knowledge of vocational adolescents' life-
world shapes the subjective orientations regarding their
post-secondary ambitions. To reach these goals, we imple-
mented two research instruments, questionnaire and inter-
views. The questionnaire enabled us to get a complete picture
on an aggregate level both of how vocational adolescents value
their schooling and of the socio-demographic composition of
vocational schools. Interviews were used to get deeper under-
standing of the social micro-process through which vocational
adolescents make sense of themselves and on how this cultural
grounding of their self-construction affects their post-second-
ary life decisions. Thus, as a consequence of the above-men-
tioned sample strategy, we delivered questionnaires to 145
eighteen-year-old adolescents attending their last year in three
vocational schools in a big city of Western Greece. Schools are
located in different areas (one in the center of the city, one in
suburban location, and one in a working-class area), and we
carried out 50 narrative interviews with 22 girls and 28 boys
of the same sample. All the names we present are fictional.
Data Collection
Given the qualitative orientation of the research, the main
data collection research technique was what Wengraf (2001)
and relevant scholars term biographical-narrative interview.
According to this way of conducting interviews, the aim is to
tap the meaningful thematic fields of the actor that support
his or her narrative renderings and how these fields are cor-
related to the life-world relevancies upon which they draw.
Priority is given to make informants use accounts containing
narratives imbued by personal experiences and not to talk
solely in an argumentative or descriptive manner about social
issues (Riessman, 2002; Rosenthal, 2004; Rubin & Rubin,
1995). Given that not all adolescents are in a position to pro-
duce extempore narratives (McLean, Pasupathi, & Pals,
2007), we made up an interview guide which we divided into
four discussion axis related to (a) their schooling experiences,
(b) their family habitus, (c) their leisure activities, and (d) to
what C. Taylor (1988) has called "strong evaluations"
(p. 310), that is, the moral boundaries that make up their value
orientations. Some of the interview questions we included in
each of these axis were the following: what were your expe-
riences from high school all these years? What are you plan-
ning to do after high school? What are your parents' dreams
of you? How was it for you to grow up in this neighborhood?
How do you spend your free time? What things or experi-
ences are you proud of? How do you imagine yourself in 5
years' time?
It should be noted that according to this type of interview-
ing, what interviewees say is not to be taken to represent
directly the outer world. The interviewer does not aim at dis-
covering whether what informants talk about corresponds to
what is happening outside the interview context. Instead, by
treating what informant say as accounts, we tried to investi-
gate the sense-making work through which participants
engage in explaining, attributing, justifying, describing, and
otherwise finding possible sense or orderliness in the various
events, people, places, and courses of action they talk about
(Bertaux, 1980; Roulston, 2010).
In parallel with narrative interviews, we delivered ques-
tionnaires to adolescents aimed at highlighting, in quantita-
tive terms, the reasons they give for attending vocational
school, the level of satisfaction they experience from this
type of school, and the job they aspire to obtain. The reason
why we used questionnaires was that we wanted to bring to
the fore possible connections between their answers in the
questionnaire and the thematic fields we tapped from their
narrative accounts. In combining data obtained from ques-
tionnaire and interviews, we aimed not at validating our find-
ings but mostly at providing complementary points of view
of the same phenomenon, namely, the role of self-formation
on how vocational adolescents take life decisions (for a simi-
lar usage of combining interviews and questionnaire on life
transitions, see Kelle, 2001).
Data Analysis
In analyzing our interview data, we emphasized the Glaserian
version of the Grounded Theory (Charmaz, 2002; Glaser,
1992, 1998, 2002), taking into account some of the principles
of narrative analysis (e.g., Riessman, 2002; Rosenthal, 1993;
Spector-Mersel, 2011). In particular, we implemented a four-
step process in dealing with the transcripted interviews: (a) we
sketched the portraits for each of the informants so as to tap
the sequential order of their biographical life events, (b) we
coded in vivo their accounts from the above-mentioned dis-
cussion axis and we wrote down in diagrammatic form the
sum of categories that emerged from each participant so as to
obtain an overall view of these categories, (c) we compared
the categories and we tried to bring to the fore the informants'
main concern (or core category) which permeated the thematic
field, and (d) in a more conceptual refining, we highlighted
how their main concerns were related to the identities they
claimed as they were articulated by means of the strong eval-
4 SAGE Open
uations regarding who they are and how they want to be per-
ceived by others.
Issues of Trustworthiness of the Research
Reliability and validity are issues which are dealt with in dif-
ferent terms in qualitative research in comparison with tradi-
tional quantitative approaches, simply because of the
intentional character of social action (Healy & Perry, 2000;
Maxwell, 1992; Seale, 1999). However, this does not mean
that qualitative researchers remain blind to such issues.
Having as an epistemological point of departure conceptions
of social world stemming from critical realism (Bhaskar,
1989; Sayer, 2000), we consider validity to be a term related
to the question how sure can one be as to the truth of what
informants say in the interviews. We have no reason to
believe that adolescents of the study intend to lie in the inter-
view or that they come to participate in it with an intention to
deceive the interviewer. Quite the contrary, in treating what
they say as accounts, what we aspire to understand is adoles-
cents' point of view on how they narrate their past, present,
and future lives and the version of the world they construct,
given the structural frames that exist in their lives (on narra-
tive interviews validity, see Elliot, 2006). Our goal was to
understand why adolescents produced these specific narra-
tive versions of the world and not others. In addition, it has
been shown that the more one commits himself or herself in
narrating his or her life, the more close the content of his or
her narration is in what "actually happened." Finally, we
checked what adolescents were saying by prompting them to
give accounts of the same experience (e.g., leisure time prac-
tices) in various narrative moments of the interview.
With regard to whether the conclusions we have reached
are accidentally produced, we tried to triangulate our data in
the following way: (a) data obtained from the questionnaire
were in the same direction with what adolescents talked
about in the interviews, namely, that they defend and posi-
tively value vocational schools, (b) we collected life stories
from adolescents who reside in different geographical loca-
tions, and we saw that it does not affect their stance against
vocational schools, and (c) due to the differentiated sampling
of our data, we were able to compare responses of adoles-
cents who have opted for various vocational specialties (e.g.,
hairdressers, car mechanics, or cooks). It was through this
threefold crosschecking process that we were able to be more
confident with regard to why vocational adolescents defend
their option to pursue vocational training. According to this
line of methodological reasoning, how theory is implemented
in data processing affects our knowledge claims as far as
generalizability is concerned. In our research, habitus theory
and narrative identity approach were implemented neither to
provide us with deductively produced hypotheses which
were going to be tested against our findings nor as a means
for operationalizing central terms of the research. By con-
trast, these theories were used as sensitized concepts through
which we were able to put questions to our data, to order
them, and to transform the emic words of the informants into
an epic argument the researcher sets up (for reasons of clar-
ity, we provide Tables 1 and 2 containing the in vivo catego-
ries and the main themes of the interview data. Habitus
theory and biographical identity enabled us to transform
these themes into theoretical argument.). Hence, what we
claim is not generalizability assured by statistical procedures
related to individuals who present the same socio-demo-
graphic variables, but a theoretical proposition containing
concepts which could explain processes that take place
within contexts similar to our own and could provide us with
interpretations as to how vocational adolescents' habitus for-
mation sets in motion specific biographical planning and
aspirations (e.g., Gobo, 2004; Payne & Williams, 2005).

Vocational Education in Greece: An Overview
Only two countries in Europe in the 19th century, Germany
and France, placed special emphasis on technical and voca-
tional education and established the relevant institutions.
However, technical schools in these founding countries have
not been particularly valued, which is somewhat surprising
because of the fact that such schools were needed for the "less
talented students," and were considered synonymous with
professional training (Prost, 1968, pp. 303-305; Ringer, 2003).
Highly influenced by what was happening in German- and
French-speaking countries, Greek educators acclaimed, espe-
cially after 1870, the need to establish an extensive network of
technical and vocational education too. In contrast to their
aspirations, however, the results of this initiative were poor,
for until the early 1960s; the number of children in technical
junior high schools and high schools did not exceed 10% of
the total number of children of this age group (15-18). Thanks
to the admonitions of International organizations, particularly
the Organization for Co-operation and Development (OCDE)
and the World Bank; the percentage of children attending sec-
ondary technical schools would reach 25% of the above-
mentioned age group during the mid-1970s. After a spectacu-
lar rise in 2002, mainly due to the strict tests applied in general
high school, this percentage increased to 41.39% of the total of
students of this age group, and now stands at around 30%.
To give an overall view, at present, about 80% of students
of the given age group attend secondary post-compulsory
education. More specifically, according to statistics from the
Ministry of Education and the Greek National Statistical
Service--during the school year 2002-2003--218,747 stu-
dents attended general high school (58.61%) and 154,464
(41.39%) a technical one. (By way of contrast, during the
school year 2008-2009, the corresponding numbers increased
to 245,314 (69.4%) for the former and fell to 108,010
(30.6%) for the latter.)
Apart from the respective differences in attendance
between the two types of schools over the 6-year period
shown by these statistics, it is worth mentioning that there
were slightly more girls than boys in general high school, but
in technical secondary education, the number of boys
remained constant at about twice that of the girls. More spe-
cifically, during the school year 2008-2009, the number of
girls in general high school was 130,764 out of a total of
245,314 students (53.2%), whereas in technical schools, girls
made up only 37,461 out of 108,010 overall (34.7%).
Despite some differences, there is no doubt that the vast
majority of children who focus on technical education come
from the neediest (both financially and culturally speaking)
social groups. This fact was confirmed in our sample too, as
in a relevant question regarding parents' profession, the
fathers' professions that prevailed were that of a farmer
(19%), laborer (22.5%), driver (6.3%), car mechanic (5%),
unemployed (3%), shop owner (11%), private sector
employer/employee (also self-employed; 5%), and other
related professions. As for their mothers' professions, 62%
responded with domestic services, private sector (as above;
18%), maid (2%), nurse (4.5%), and public servant (6.2%).
Defending Vocational Schooling
The first question we posed to students concerned the degree
of satisfaction they felt in their school by asking them
whether they had a good time in vocational school, using the
measurement scale of "no," "moderate," "good," and "very
good." We considered "no" and "moderate" to express more
openly the negative stance against this question and "good"
and "very good" the positive. A total of 73.5% of students
answered "good" and "very good," while 26.5% were not so
satisfied with their experience.
The reasons for their attendance was the second question
we posed, and the answers we provided were (a) "because
attendance in TS is easier," (b) "because my attendance in
vocational school helps me to accomplish my professional
goals," (c) "because I could not cope with general high
school," (d) "because my friends are in vocational school,"
and (e) "because of other reasons." In comparison with the

6 SAGE Open
adolescents who answered (a) and (c), what was surprising
was the fact that 67.6% of students chose the second answer,
believing that they had more or less made a choice scheduled
on the basis of plans made in an earlier time.Answers (d) and
(e) gathered 13.2% each, while those who chose "other rea-
sons" did not actually clarify their answer.
The fact that students expressed a conscious choice as far
as their motivation to attend vocational school is concerned
is further supported by the manner in which they answered
the next question: "Which school do you consider better: the
general high school or TS?" A total of 78% of students
answered in favor of vocational school, obviously in an effort
to defend technical high school and the career opportunities
offered in attending it. This is further related to the answers
they gave to the next three questions. The fourth and the fifth
question asked students to evaluate the career prospects of
their friends attending general high schools, while the sixth
asked if they thought that vocational school provided them
with the skills needed for their professional career. Sixty-five
percent of vocational students believe that children attending
General high school will find themselves in a worse position
in comparison with themselves in regard to their career suc-
cess, and that better professional prospects awaited children
of technical high school (75%), providing them with the nec-
essary skills to do so (87%).
All in all, our findings conclude that students of technical-
vocational education generally consider themselves satisfied
with their studies. They posit as a key motivation or reason
for their choice, their professional prospects, and they place
themselves in a privileged position compared with general
high school graduates. When asked to identify the profession
they want to practice in the future, they referred to the pro-
fessions of car mechanic (19.6%), refrigerant technician
(13%), and electrician (11 7%). However, 17 of them (33%)
gave no answer as they were undecided.
The high percentage of those who gave no answer should
not be explained simply in terms of class culture but also in
relation to the extent in which the interaction networks of
these students are capable of providing them with enough
social capital to invest in working-class jobs or in related
prospects. From the analyses of the questionnaires, it could
be argued that vocational students' views on how they
face their career prospects are permeated by the following
characteristics:
A. They consider themselves as being satisfied with their
attendance, and they present as a basic motivation for
their choice, the help technical education offers them
in finding employment in post-adolescent years.
B. This incentive seems to give them reasons to construct
narratives of themselves within which they represent
their identities as superior in comparison with the stu-
dents of general high school, believing that the latter
will find themselves at a later disadvantage in the job
market.
If we stick to the last two findings, one could approach
them via the rational-choice model: Pupils invest in school
after having calculated the costs and the likely profits of their
efforts, meaning that children from poor backgrounds do not
invest in school as much as pupils attending general high
schools because the benefits related to them are not worth
pursuing. This consideration, however, cannot explain a key
finding of the questionnaires, that is, the contrast observed
between the effort to support their choice to attend voca-
tional school and the fact that one out of three pupils seemed
to be unable to answer the question regarding the profession
he or she wants to practice in the future. In addition, the
question still remains as to what extent the fact that they
value and defend vocational school is related to the way their
self-formation is shaped. In other words, what the question-
naire does not highlight concerns whether their option in pur-
suing working-class jobs via vocational schooling has been
planned in rational terms in their junior high school years or
it is the end product of their effort to coherently reconstruct
their past, present, and future self. In the next sections, we
aim at shedding light to this question.
Identity Claims in Vocational Adolescents'
Schooling Trajectories
In coding our interview data, one permanent theme that per-
meated adolescents' answers was that vocational school
comes to be crystallized as post-junior high school option in
connection with what Gubrium and Holstein (1995) called
"local culture" (p. 50), that is, locally promoted and bio-
graphically sedimented ways and interpretive resources for
making sense of their lives. One of our interviewees, Maria,
for instance, raised in an extended family in a village, has
excluded the choice of attending university from her options,
despite succeeding in national exams, believing that this
does not constitute a worthwhile investment from a career
point of view. Discussing her plans about the future, the
biased enthusiasm of the researcher for "undergraduate stu-
dent life," which intrudes unconsciously in our interaction, is
contradicted by Maria in the blatant and matter-of-fact way
she defends and promotes her career prospects:
Extract 1:
How did you do in your national exams?
I succeeded as an agriculturist in plant production
Department
So are you going to start your undergraduate career now?
I don't know. I don't think I will go.
Why so?
What for? Just to have a certificate that I graduated from
Higher Technical Education? There are no jobs. To go
there for five years and then for two more looking for
a job?
And what are you thinking of doing?
Kiprianos and Christodoulou 7
I'm thinking of getting a job to get money quickly or
become a hairdresser . . . Our financial status isn't that
good to go to study in one other town but, okay, I have
also applied to the police force for a position as a spe-
cial guard.
Insofar as she has been helping her father in the farming
of their land since she was a child, and to the extent that she
knows that growing crops will not enable her to establish a
career (not because it is a man's world, but because "you are
left with nothing, you end up in debt"), Maria experiences
her relation with time in terms of pressure. For Maria, higher
technical education constitutes neither a means of attaining
upward social mobility nor a form of investment in which
she will obtain prestige, issues that do not seem to have
crossed her mind as she has already decided not to attend the
faculty she has succeeded in the national exams. Her motives
and her goals are combined in such a way that she grounds
her educational choices not on a positively formulated job
perspective but rather on the avoidance of a future negative
situation (unemployment).
If this is the case, however, why did she choose to attend
technical senior high school as she does not consider it as a
means for realizing job aspirations? The answer could lie in
what Schutz (1973) called a "system of relevances" (p. 229),
that is, in her motivational statements through which her
world comes to be seen as taken for granted and within which
the major and minor issues that make up her life are speci-
fied. Discussing the reasons, Maria invokes to attend voca-
tional school; she enunciates a range of typifications which
allow her to put an order to her school experience and to
privilege her self-determination:
Extract 2:
And why did you choose Technical and not General [high
school]?
Because I do not like studying a lot. Because I knew that
General [high school] includes courses such asAncient
Greek and Mathematics; courses I couldn't handle.
Only in the first grade of the technical high school are
we taught the same courses with General [school] with
the exception of Ancient Greek. Then in the second
grade I was able to select the classes of my section,
easy classes, and a lot of laboratory courses . . . In gen-
eral, [school] in my opinion, whoever wants to enter
university, to study, attends this kind of school, while
in the technical one all children come [to school] with-
out a satchel. I selected technical [school] just to have
a good final mark because in general [school] I
wouldn't be able achieve that. I do not have the
patience to study, while in technical school I would
just study for the classes I was examined in. It's not
that I don't want to study. It's that I am unable to focus
on studying for hours.
It is evident that Maria places herself in the "non-studi-
ous" category of students, not so much in the sense that she
chooses not to study, but mainly because of her mood and a
lack of patience. This self-typification does not seem to be a
source of shame or embarrassment against someone (i.e., the
researcher) who is presented as an exponent of the values of
the school institution. Rather, it is something that it may be
indicative of the fact that the categorization of students into
"studious" and "non-studious" is so obvious to her that she
does not consider it threatening to the way she presents her-
self. It has a clearly practical value for her, functioning as a
way not so much to make a post-secondary school decision,
but rather to deal with her schooling trajectory and to make a
choice as to whether to attend general or vocational school
after junior high school. The "studious"/"non-studious" clas-
sification allows her to attribute motives to the members of
these two groups in relation to post-junior high school
choices, for the former go to general high school to "enter a
faculty in Higher Technical Education or a university" while
the latter choose to attend vocational school to "get a good
final mark."
Furthermore, the self-positionings students of technical
school produce to interpret their choice to attend vocational
school are also a source that permits them to biographically
thematize their identity claims. Those students who defend
their choice do so not only to highlight the social signifi-
cance of technical education but also to protect the interpre-
tation and the categorization of themselves as "non-studious."
They achieve this through the way they understand their rela-
tion to the general high school students. When we asked
them their opinion about general high school students, we
got the following answers:
Extract 3:
They are different characters. For example, boys are totally
different. There is no relation [to us]. I call them "college-boys,"
as if it was a college. They study a lot, nerds, while the boys in
technical [school] never enter the class. They never attend
classes. Students project a cunning image of themselves. No
lesson can be taught, there is a mess. Even teachers are different
between the two [kinds of] schools. Let's say that in technical
schools they are friends with the teachers. They talk to them in
singular. Only the headmaster was a bit strict. (Eva, 17)
Extract 4:
Well, General school has many differences with the Technical
because I have a friend who attends General . . . That is to say
children are very different . . . That is, in our school they
don't care about anything.
What do you mean?
That they care to have a car, a motorbike and how to earn
money, while in General school they care about their
future, too.
8 SAGE Open
Do you have friends from General [school]?
Yes. I connect with a guy, but he doesn't care about any-
thing. He's like us.
That is to say there is a distinction between the guys com-
ing from General and Technical [schools] . . .
I believe there is no relation at all. No relation . . . No rela-
tion with these guys. (Jim, 17, emphasis added)
Extract 5:
Studious students are not the most normal people, it's kind of
like a college there; they're not the most normal people. It's
quite obvious. Basically, I believe that over there most of them
live in a fantasy world. They just study to enter a faculty. I know
that because I attended first class in General [school] but I quit
as I didn't study. Everyone is a crank there. I used to try to fit in,
but they didn't pay attention to me, and I said that it was not
worth being with them and I left. (Alex, 17)
It is obvious from the above passages that for technical
education students, the sense of difference is experienced in
emotionally strained and gendered terms. Masculinity and
the undermining of official school values ("No lesson can be
taught, there is a mess," Extract 3) function as a basis for a
gendered standardization and classification of students
("They study a lot," Extract 3), and as evidence of the sepa-
rate and potentially superior behavior of vocational school
students. The emphasis given to masculinity serves as a
resource to morally legitimize the mode of action of those
who fall into the category of such students who can state, "It's
not that I don't want to study. It's that I am unable to . . . " The
identity that technical education students claim refers to the
fact that they are "non-studious," and that attendance in tech-
nical school is grounded on all those practices through which
"mess" is performed and money is earned.
For our speakers, their sense of self is formed by what
they exclude and evaluate negatively, such as to be "studi-
ous," "college-boys," "nerds," and "crank" (Extract 5), prop-
erties they think are suited to general high schools students.
By means of this classificatory evaluation, pupils in voca-
tional schooling not only make motivational statements
about two types of different school contexts but claim to
valorize their belonging in vocational education in relation
to pupils of General high schools as well. The emotionally
charged character of these relational self-understandings is
tied up with the unequal social value that is attributed to
vocational and general education in Greece. Thus, to the
extent that pupils in vocational education seem to defend an
institution devoid of what Bourdieu would have called "sym-
bolic capital" (Bourdieu, 1984, pp. 466-480), they come to
forge a sense of connectedness based on their trying to
deflect official classifications that defines them as being
"less talented." Knowing that they have in common a present
with no future (in contradistinction to General school pupils
who share a future with no present), pupils in vocational edu-
cation attempt to define as valuable both the institution they
live in and, even more so, their way of being-in-the-world.
But what this being-in-the-world actually consists of and
how are their identity claims embodied in actual practices?
Through what experiences and feelings is their cultural world
constructed and deemed worthy of respect? And, finally, to
what extent does this cultural world function as a reserve
within which their sense of manliness is to be sustained?
Embodied Cultures in Adolescents'
Everyday Lives
The identity pupils in vocational education claim by dint of
the vocabularies of motives they draw upon is not a cognitive
matter or something that happens within their head but rather
a constitutive aspect of their life-world experiences. What
we want to argue is that adolescents'identity claims are not a
psychological mechanism deployed in their cognitive pro-
cesses, but instead that it emerges in the collectively orga-
nized and meaningful practices they engage in in their
everyday life interactions. The par excellence practice where
one can see the emergent nature of vocational adolescents'
identity is motorcycle driving. The range of meanings they
develop in motorcycle driving and the values that permeate it
are revealing of their collective attempt to make sense of
themselves and to forge their career plans. Motorbike is not
just a means of transport but a symbol of sociability and a
sign of embodied skillfulness. Take Jim, for example,
Extract 6:
Where did you use to go in the afternoons?
We used to gather in the square or go for a ride with our
motorcycles.
And what did you use to do in the square?
We used to discuss things and sometimes to play over
there . . . To play? Basically we used to make a fuss so
that the police come and chase us. You know, to laugh.
And did the police used to come?
Yeah listen to me, listen to me . . . Another time a police
officer came and we had hidden the motorbikes and
okay . . . The police officer left. Then we created
trouble again and the police car arrived and . . .
When you say trouble, what did you do namely?
We went here and there by motorbike . . . "Accelerations"
. . .
And what time did you use to do that?
At night. Half past eleven, twelve o' clock. Something
like that. Basically, it's nice like this. I like living this
way.
In the above passage, our speaker does not describe some-
thing he has seen but in his narration valorizes something he has
experienced. Dimitris likes challenging authorities "for fun"
and as a way of living, because through this ritualized provoca-
tion he builds, proves, and strengthens his relationship with his
Kiprianos and Christodoulou 9
friends as it provides him with opportunities for testing his
capacity in effectively handling motorbikes. The use he
makes of the motorbike means that it is a necessary and sig-
nificant symbol of their cultural toolkit and a cultural object
in which they collectively attribute meaning and value and
obtain access to their social practices. The street and the
square are experienced by the adolescents of our sample as
social places for displaying their capacity in driving motor-
bikes. Doing "accelerations" is a collectively orchestrated
ritual that bonds together those who participate in it as the
shared knowledge of doing so functions as a sign of member-
ship of their social group. Risk taking in driving motorbikes
(usually without a license) is something they have learned to
face from their childhood years, while all the potential fail-
ures encountered (tumbles, injuries, and accidents) constitute
primary stages for successful and skillful driving in the
future:
Extract 7:
And what intrigues you in the whole situation?
For me it's the experience . . . Well, those who do drag
races didn't start right away on a 1000cc motorbike,
my man. They used to race with small motorbikes here
and there, on 650cc motorbikes and stuff, and then
they ride these [1000cc motorbikes]. They do not ride
them right away. They start when they are young.
And how did you learn?
I used to watch the others and I did it. And I decided to do
it. What's the big deal? Well, in order to learn this you
should tumble twice or three times, that's for sure
(Andrew, 17)
Excitement for these students means their involvement in
the possibility of failure as its surpassing of this is indicative
of their moral strength and provides an opportunity to dis-
play "character" to their friends. Learning to handle a motor-
bike and its concomitant risks is a process inscribed in body
movements. Their body, through mimicry, comes to be
adjusted in patterned ways to all the practical exigencies of a
specific kind of driving which necessitates total control of all
the parts of the motorbike. Students in our interviews liked to
narrate stories full of incidents indicating the high risk of
motorbike driving and of the embodied skillfulness which is
demanded in overcoming it. Only in such practical testing
does one come to understand how to move and use one's
body when driving the motorbike; that is, how to position
one's body upon it so that one can have the mastery of the
correct speed, height, or twist of the body when driving
dangerously:
Extract 8:
Yes, you know why this is difficult, eh? Basically, on powerful
motorbikes they do not do that because the moment you shift
gear and you have the hand here the steering wheel can twist and
the motorbike might drive on one wheel . . . I watched a
motorbike in a drag race and a car appeared and hit the rider.
Well, he was not hurt but you should have seen the way he fell
off . . . (Tom, 18)
Extract 9:
Well, I don't know how to handle it with the foot very well,
because to go straight forward you use the foot, then you
"play" with the brake, brake-throttle, brake-throttle . . . Did
you use to ride a bike [in such a way on one wheel]?
Yes. yes. I used to do it.
Using the brake, right?
Yes. yes.
So, as you pressed the pedal you motivate the pedal and
the brake. Move the pedal and brake. That's it, but you
also have to find the torque to raise it.
And aren't you afraid?
Look, my best friend has never fallen off, and he rides it
straightforwardly, a motorbike without gears, while
with a more powerful motorbike it's different. You
know something? With the bigger motorbike? The first
time I made a shift from first to second [gear], I opened
the legs . . . unconsciously . . . You don't say the foot
goes there and press the pedal off the brake. That's it,
you have to learn this. (Mike, 17)
Learning to drive in the street presupposes that the driver
has gradually learned to coordinate his body movements in
accordance to how the motorbike is moving so that he has
reached a point where his body can unconsciously adjust on
its own "unconsciously," without needing "to say that the
foot goes there and press the pedal off the brake." One can
easily see that driving entails the discipline of the body and
the following of "rules" that are intuitively assimilated, with-
out it being necessary to attain knowledge explicitly formu-
lated and learned. This pre-reflective and bodily knowledge
valorized by those vocational education pupils interviewed
functions as a source of accumulating symbolic capital
within the peer group. Practical mastery of a motorbike in
risky driving situations is experienced as a personal exploit
capable of creating feelings of pride in those who publicly
exhibit the strength to face the challenge, insofar as over-
coming danger entails a combination of body-movement pat-
terning with improvisation.
It can be seen then that the students of our sample have
learned in practice to face this embodied skillfulness as a kind
of personal and improvised accomplishment in relation to
forming a hierarchy of status among them. Furthermore, the
rules and the principles of this kind of visual learning and of
practical imitation, thanks to which this embodied know-how
in motorbike driving is developed, are nowhere explicitly for-
mulated, and yet are formed collectively by the members of
10 SAGE Open
the group. This is a kind of knowledge forged both through
practice and experience (in riding on one wheel, in accelera-
tion, in drag racing, etc.) and tested in risky circumstances.
Its principles are transferred though word of mouth, and only
by those who have themselves been initiated, thus creating
the feeling that they are indeed special.
Conclusion
While previous years research on vocational adolescent
identity formation posits that the core element of its evolve-
ment revolves around adolescent disavowal for vocational
school qualifications, our findings highlight that adolescents
of our days do not seem to reject the profits these qualifica-
tions could assure them. In particular, today's adolescents
seem to make sense of themselves in forging biographical
identities by which they try to reconcile two contrasting life-
world experiences: on one hand, they ground their self-posi-
tionings in reversing official school culture classifications by
promoting the embodied skills they acquire in their out-of-
school interactions and by valorizing "street knowledge,"
and on the other hand, they have to construct life plans based
on the qualifications the vocational school provides.
We consider this finding to be in line with A. Taylor's
(2005) argument that it is the evolvement of social self in
school life that gives shape to vocational adolescents' deci-
sion making. What we have shown is that the crucial and
core element of this evolvement concerns the extent to which
agency affects vocational adolescents' habitus formation.
More specifically, we noted that in trying to reconcile these
contrasting urgencies, adolescents' habitus is shaped not
only in an unconscious and practical way but it is through its
reflexive involvement in forging narrative identities combin-
ing experiences from their street culture with the prospects
entailed in vocational school that habitus is formed. In other
words, vocational adolescents' habitus is constructed in
reflexive terms through narrative self-understandings that
make them capable to align their working-class lives with the
new prospects the vocational schools promises. Within this
context, vocational adolescents try to make a socially deval-
uated institution, that is, technical schools, into a place where
proper admission is dependent on the extent to which one
accepts the criteria of vocational identity membership they
try to impose. Through such practices as if and when they
will bring a satchel, if and how many absences will be noted
down, if they go to school by motorcycle, and whether they
question a teacher's authority and undermine the official
school values that usually prevail in general high schools,
vocational adolescents try to make technical education into
something that belongs to them, by controlling the ebb and
flow of its daily school life and by claiming that this is their
way to "define the situation" of what schooling means.
Insofar as they cannot turn their backs to the job careers
which are based on these qualifications because of the cre-
dentialization of job market, adolescents of our days come to
shape their identity claims in navigating between these two
contrasting demands. Defending vocational school is their
way to narratively cohere both the practical logic of their
habitus shaped in street-knowledge exigencies and the skills
qualified in their passage from vocational training. As the
jobs they aspire to cannot be taken without the vocational
training they go through in their teen years, today's adoles-
cents cannot rely only on careers provided by "street corner
society" connections.
Despite the fact that other researchers have pointed out
the role of the informal networks in assuring successful pas-
sages into work life, what they have missed concerns that
working-class social networks are not as much weak and
incapable as these researchers believe (see, for example,
Walther, Stauber, & Pohl, 2005). In contrast, one should not
downplay the social capital they acquire through the net-
works they forge in their local cultures. To the extent that they
make job decisions related either to their father's job or to
their embodied cultures, adolescents through their vocational
training try to make the unofficial skills acquired in these cul-
tures into educational qualifications. For instance, buying a
motorbike, exchanging it with another one, the care they
invest in fixing it, to paint it, to change its engine and improve
it, the drag races they do, and the bets they lay, are all indica-
tive of the process through which it is possible for these ado-
lescents to plan their job-related careers. It is exactly their
immersion into the motorbike culture that which provides
them with an intersubjective stock of knowledge upon which
they draw for constructing their life decisions and possible
selves. In other words, in case that an adolescent raised in this
life-world locality chooses to become a car mechanic, for
example, he has to follow the path of vocational training in
order to transform the embodied skills he acquired in this
social world into qualifications which will enable him
exchange them with a working-class job career. This finding
is more close to relevant research which has shown how
working-class adolescents transform their local knowledge
into cultural capital which enables them to navigate in job
market (Bottrell, 2009; France, Bottrell, & Haddon, 2013).
In a more theoretical vein, it is our contention that by
combining the concept of habitus with how identity is bio-
graphically thematized can youth sociologists explain why
working-class adolescents of our era seem to be in a situation
of permanent disjunction that permeates their life stories. As
other writers have claimed (Adams, 2006; Sweetman, 2003),
the disjunction is born out of the fact that their aspirations to
follow a normal biography containing job security and settled
life are at odds with the flexible and risky options opened up
for them by the vocational training. Raised in the contexts of
this disjunction, vocational adolescents become familiarized
with a reflexive habitus which makes them feel that decision
making is a stressful and burdened social action because they
do not control the criteria of entrance into manual jobs. Thus,
reflexivity is turned into biographical ambivalence that feeds
an identity formation process through which working-class
Kiprianos and Christodoulou 11
adolescents come to be aware of the frustration entailed in the
gap between aspirations and access to resources. Only by
unraveling the ebb and flow of the social embeddedness within
which decision making of vocational adolescents' biographi-
cal planning is shaped can policy makers produce forms of
guidance adjusted to their practical needs and values.
