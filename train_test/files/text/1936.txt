There is accumulating evidence from US epidemiological stud-
ies of an inverse association between blood pressure (BP) and
vitamin D status, as measured by blood levels of 25-hydroxy-
vitamin D (25(OH)D). In cohort studies of US health profes-
sionals, both measured and estimated baseline plasma 25(OH)
D levels were inversely associated with risk of incident hyper-
tension separately in men and women.1,2 Participants from
the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) in the highest quintile of serum 25(OH)D had
significantly lower mean systolic BP compared with those in
the lowest quintile, after adjusting for body mass index (BMI).3
A recent report from a cross-sectional survey of Hispanics and
African Americans observed inverse associations between
plasma 25(OH)D and both systolic and diastolic BP, which
were no longer significant after adjusting for BMI.4 In contrast,
vitamin D supplementation (with calcium) did not lower BP
in the Women's Health Initiative study,5 probably because of
the low vitamin D dose and poor compliance.6
It is currently unclear whether the inverse association
between vitamin D status and BP is mediated by blood lev-
els of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Both PTH and vitamin D
are calciotrophic hormones and their metabolisms are closely
related, such that a decrease in serum 25(OH)D leads to a rise
in serum PTH.7 Elevated level of PTH has long been linked to
hypertension.8­13
However, only a few epidemiological studies of BP have
examined both 25(OH)D and PTH together. Although a US
prospective study has reported a significant inverse associa-
tion between baseline 25(OH)D levels and subsequent risk
of hypertension that is independent of PTH,2 other studies,
which have reported findings for both hormones, have gener-
ally found that BP is more strongly associated with PTH (posi-
tively) than with 25(OH)D (negatively);14­16 suggesting that
the effect of vitamin D on BP is indirect through to its suppres-
sion of serum PTH. Moreover, it is unclear whether the find-
ings from these studies apply to the general adult population as
they have recruited samples from older age groups,14 wealthy

Vitamin D, Parathyroid Hormone, and Blood Pressure
in the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Surveys
Jack L. He1 and Robert K. Scragg1
Background
Previous research shows serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and
parathyroid hormone (PTH) are each associated with blood pressure
(BP), but it is unclear whether these associations are independent.
Methods
Cross-sectional data from the US National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys (NHANES) during 2003­2006. Analyses were
restricted to 7,561 participants aged 20 years with measurements
of 25(OH)D, PTH, BP, BP treatment, smoking, physical activity,
serum calcium, and creatinine. Results were adjusted for these plus
demographic variables.
Results
Serum 25(OH)D was more strongly associated (inversely) with systolic
than diastolic BP. Adjusted mean (standard error) difference in BP
for the lowest 25(OH)D quintile (13ng/ml) was 3.5 (0.7) mm Hg
for systolic BP and 1.8 (0.6) mm Hg for diastolic BP, compared with
the highest quintile (30ng/ml). In contrast, PTH was positively
associated with both systolic and diastolic BP (P < 0.0001). Adjusted
mean (standard error) difference in BP for the highest PTH quintile
(59ng/l) was 5.9 (0.8) mm Hg for systolic BP and 4.5 (0.5) mm Hg for
diastolic BP, compared with the lowest quintile (27ng/l).When both
25(OH)D and PTH were included in the same model, the associations
of PTH with systolic and diastolic BP were unchanged. However, the
associations between 25(OH)D and BP were attenuated, with mean
(standard error) difference between the highest and lowest quintiles
being 2.2 (0.6) mm Hg for systolic BP (P < 0.01) and 0.8 (0.6) mm Hg for
diastolic BP.
Conclusion
PTH may mediate most of the association between 25(OH)D and BP,
which was not significant when also adjusting for body mass index.

ties such as obesity.16
A recent report of data collected in the 2003­2004 NHANES,
examining the association between 25(OH)D, PTH, and the
metabolic syndrome in fasting participants, found that serum
25(OH)D was inversely associated with systolic BP (P = 0.005)
but not diastolic (P = 0.3), while PTH was not associated with
either (P = 0.3, 0.2, respectively).17 However, the authors did
not indicate whether they simultaneously adjusted for 25(OH)
D and PTH when analyzing BP, so it is unclear if there were
any confounding effects between 25(OH)D and PTH on BP. In
this article, which also comes from the NHANES surveys, we
have made BP the primary outcome variable; and increased the
sample size several fold from the earlier report by using data
for the full survey periods for which PTH data are currently
available (2003­2006), and by including both fasting and non-
fasting participants in our analyses. The increased sample
size has allowed us to determine with much greater statistical
power whether-or-not 25(OH)D and PTH are independently
associated with BP.
Methods
Data in this report come from participants aged 20 years
the NHANES 2003­2006 surveys conducted by the National
Centre for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. A stratified, multistage sampling design was
used to recruit participants from household clusters, with
oversampling of non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans.
The surveys included a face-to-face interview and a medical
examination carried out in a mobile examination center. Full
details have been published of all survey methods, including
sampling, interview at home, examination at mobile cent-
ers and laboratory measurement of blood samples, ethical
approval and informed consent.18
In the home interview, demographic information regarding
age, race­ethnicity (divided into non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Mexican American, and other), and gender
was collected.18 Participants were also asked whether they
were currently taking prescribed antihypertensive drugs, the
number of cigarettes they currently smoked, and the number
of times they had undertaken common leisure physical activi-
ties in the past month. Metabolic equivalents were assigned
to each physical activity and totaled; a score of 3.5­7.0 was
classified as doing moderate activities for participants 20­59
years of age, a score of 3.0­6.0 was classified as doing moderate
activities for participants over 60 years of age.19
The medical examination was taken within 2 months of
the home interview.18 Weight was measured in pounds (later
converted to kilograms) using digital scales with participants
wearing underwear, disposable gowns, and foam slippers.
Standing height was measured against a vertical backboard
to the nearest millimeter. BMI was calculated as weight (kg)
divided by standing height (m) squared.
BP was measured at the mobile examination centers by
physicians with mercury sphygmomanometers using a stand-
ard protocol. Cuff size was selected according to a standard
protocol to ensure that the length and width of the bladder
inside the cuff encircled 80 and 40% of the upper arm, respec-
tively. Up to three BP measurements were collected from each
participant while in the sitting position, and averaged after
excluding the first measurement if more than one measure-
ment was collected. Systolic BP was defined as the point at
which the first Korotkoff sound was heard; while diastolic BP
was the level of mercury 2mm below where the last sound
was heard.18 Pulse pressure was calculated as the difference
between systolic and diastolic pressures.
Blood samples collected during the examination were centri-
fuged, aliquoted and frozen to -70°C on site, and shipped on
dry ice to central laboratories where they were stored at -70°C
until analysis. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by a radioim-
munoassay kit after extraction with acetonitrile (DiaSorin,
Stillwater, MN) by the National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta,
GA). PTH was analyzed on an Elecsys 1010 analyzer using
an electrochemiluminescent process at the University of
Washington, Seattle, WA.18 The coefficient of variation dur-
ing 2003­2006 was in the range of 4.4­13.2% for 25(OH)D
and 2.2­5.3% for PTH. Serum total calcium and creatinine
were measured with Beckman Synchron LX20 analyzers using
standard laboratory methods.18
A total of 4,742 adults in 2003­2004 and 4,773 in 2005­2006
aged 20 years attended mobile examination centers. Data in
this report are restricted to 7,561 non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, and Mexican American adults 20 years who
attended the mobile examination centers, after excluding those
of "Other" nationalities (n = 396), who were missing informa-
tion on serum 25(OH)D (n = 493), serum PTH (n = 46), systo-
lic or diastolic BP (n = 511), BMI status (n = 106), whether
they were currently taking BP medication (n = 49), current
cigarette smoking (n = 328), and serum calcium or creatinine
(n = 25).
Statistical analysis was carried out using SUDAAN (ver-
sion 10.0.0; Research Triangle Park, NC) to adjust for differ-
ential sampling and to correct standard errors for any design
effect arising from clustered sampling. The sampling weights
for each 2-year survey period were halved so that results
were applicable to the current US population. Multiple linear
regression was performed using PROC REGRESS with BP as
the dependent variable. BP (systolic, diastolic, and pulse pres-
sure), serum calcium, and serum creatinine were all analyzed
as continuous variables. All had normal distributions except
creatinine, which was transformed to the natural logarithm
in data analyses. Values for the categories of other continuous
variables (age, BMI) are shown in Table 1. The P values from
all statistical tests were two sided.

the highest 25(OH)D and the lowest PTH level, whereas non-
Hispanic blacks were the opposite, with Mexican Americans in
between. Physical activity was strongly related (positively) with
serum 25(OH)D, but had a much weaker (inverse) associa-
tion with PTH. Participants taking BP medication had signifi-
cantly (P = 0.0001) higher PTH levels than those not, with no

difference in mean 25(OH)D level between these two groups.
BMI was associated inversely with serum 25(OH)D and posi-
tively with serum PTH. In contrast, participants who smoked
20 cigarettes per day had lower serum levels of both 25(OH)D
(-2.6nmol/l, P = 0.042) and PTH (-8.5ng/l, P < 0.0001) com-
pared to those who had never smoked cigarettes, adjusting for
all variables in Table 1.
Table 2 shows mean systolic BP by quintile of serum 25(OH)
D and PTH for four models. In model 1, which adjusted for age,
gender, ethnicity, physical activity, cigarette smoking, BP medi-
cation status, serum calcium, and serum creatinine, systolic BP
varied across 25(OH)D quintiles being 3.5mm Hg higher in
the lowest vitamin D quintile compared with the highest (P <
0.0001). Adding PTH to the model decreased the mean differ-
ences in the higher 25(OH)D quintiles compared to the low-
est (model 2), although there was still a significant difference
between the highest and lowest 25(OH)D quintiles (P = 0.0013).
A similar pattern was seen when BMI was added (model 3).
However, in model 4, which contained both PTH and BMI, the
association between 25(OH)D and systolic BP was attenuated so
that the difference in BP between the highest and lowest 25(OH)
D quintiles was no longer significant (P = 0.07).
Table 3 shows the same four models for diastolic BP, which
was significantly raised in the two lowest serum 25(OH)D
quintiles compared with the highest, adjusting for the vari-
ables in model 1 (P = 0.007). However, adding PTH (model
2) attenuated the association between 25(OH)D and diastolic
pressure so that the mean difference between the highest and
lowest 25(OH)D quintiles was now only 0.8mm Hg (P = 0.24).
A similar pattern was seen after adding BMI (model 3).
In contrast, because serum 25(OH)D was more strongly
associated (inversely) with systolic than diastolic BP, there was
a significant inverse association between 25(OH)D and pulse
pressure, which was significantly raised in the lowest 25(OH)
D quintile compared with the highest, with the P value from
this comparison ranging from 0.005 in model 1 up to 0.04 in
model 4 (Table 4).
The association between serum 25(OH)D and BP did not
vary with age. When 25(OH)D was modeled as a continuous
variable and age as a dummy variable categorized as 1 for 50
years and 0 for below, the P value for the interaction term from
the product of these two variables was not significant for all
three BP measures (for systolic P = 0.86, diastolic P = 0.31,
pulse pressure P = 0.36).
A different pattern was seen for serum PTH than for 25(OH)
D. In model 1, which did not include BMI or serum 25(OH)
D, there was a significant positive association in both systolic
and diastolic BP with increasing PTH quintile (P < 0.0001),
with mean differences in BP between the lowest and highest
quintiles being 5.9 and 4.5mm Hg, respectively (Tables 2 and
3). These differences in systolic and diastolic BP between PTH
quintiles decreased with the addition of 25(OH)D (model 2)
and of BMI to the model (model 3), but still remained very
significant. Because PTH had associations of similar magni-
tude with systolic and diastolic BP, it was unrelated to pulse
pressure in all four models in Table 4.

Discussion
We have shown in this representative sample of the US popula-
tion that serum PTH is associated positively with both systolic
and diastolic BP independently of serum 25(OH)D and BMI.
In contrast, serum 25(OH)D is associated inversely only with
systolic BP (and not with diastolic), after controlling for either
PTH or BMI but not both; and with pulse pressure independ-
ently of both PTH and BMI. There was no interaction with age
in the association between serum 25(OH)D and BP, in contrast
with previous findings from NHANES III.3

Vitamin D, PTH, and Blood Pressure in NHANES
The positive association between serum PTH and BP is con-
sistent with previous studies.8­12,14,16 The lack of an association
between PTH and BP in a previous report from the 2003­2004
NHANES survey is probably due to the much smaller sample
size (n = 1,654), restricted to people who were fasting, with
reduced power to detect an association, compared with our
analyses.17
Previous cross-sectional studies, which measured both
25(OH)D and PTH, have not reported data on the association
between 25(OH)D and BP adjusted for PTH,14­17 possibly
because mostly they observed no association between vita-
min D and BP, even without adjusting for obesity (with waist
circumference).14­16 Only the report from the 2003­2004
NHANES survey reported an inverse association between
25(OH)D and systolic pressure (but not diastolic), which was
present after adjusting for waist circumference.17 The smaller
sample sizes in these studies (all <2,000), than in our report,
has probably limited their statistical power to consistently
detect an association between 25(OH)D and BP. In contrast,
the prospective study of Forman et al., which selected its case­
control sample (including 742 incident cases) from a cohort of
over 29,000 women followed for 6­9 years, reported a signifi-
cant inverse association between baseline 25(OH)D levels and
risk if incident hypertension, adjusting for PTH, but no data
were reported on the association between PTH and hyperten-
sion, nor on potential confounding effects from PTH on the
vitamin D-BP association.2
Larger studies have reported inverse associations between
blood levels of 25(OH)D and BP.1,3 We have shown for the first
time here, in a sample of nearly 8,000 participants, that adjust-
ment for PTH removes much, but not all, of the association
between 25(OH)D and systolic BP. This finding suggests that
PTH mediates most of the association between vitamin D and
BP, although there may be a small direct effect of vitamin D on
BP that is independent of PTH.
PTH has a strong association with diastolic BP, which has
been documented previously.10,16 In contrast, serum 25(OH)
D was not associated with diastolic BP, resulting in an inverse
association with pulse pressure, as found in our earlier report
from NHANES III.3
PTH is a calciotrophic hormone, but its effects on BP are
not fully understood and include a number of possible mecha-
nisms. It stimulates renal conversion of 25(OH)D to the active
form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D,7 resulting in raised intra-
cellular calcium levels, increased smooth muscle tone and
hypertension;20 increases collagen reorganization in vascular
smooth muscle cells and is therefore prosclerotic;21 increases
endothelial synthesis of inflammatory factors associated with
endothelial dysfunction, such interleukin-6;22 and stimulates
the rennin­angiotensin system in humans.23 Parathyroid
hypertensive factor may also be involved.24 Further, evidence
of a PTH receptor has been identified in both smooth muscle
and endothelium.25,26
Like PTH, vitamin D's association with BP is not fully under-
stood and is an active area of research.27 The presence of a vita-

suggests that vitamin D has a direct effect on vascular function
and it is possible that the confounding effect of PTH on the
association between vitamin D and BP that we observed may
only be statistical and of no biological significance. It is also

unclear whether BMI should be considered as a confounder
or an intermediary along the possible causal pathway between
vitamin D and BP;3,4 and intervention studies are required
to clarify this. Several studies have shown that vitamin D has
proendothelial function effects,30 and is inversely associ-
ated with arterial calcification31,32 and internal carotid artery
intima­media thickness in some33 but not all studies.34 It is
possible that vitamin D improves general arterial health and
increases arterial elasticity, thus improving arterial compli-
ance. Increased arterial compliance results in decreased pulse
pressure, which is reflected in our current findings and those
of NHANES III.3 However, other research suggests that unreg-
ulated oral vitamin D is involved in the atherosclerotic process
and increases vessel calcification through increased extrarenal
synthesis of the active metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.35
Alternatively, vitamin D may also act on nonvascular tis-
sues, such as juxtaglomerular cells, by downregulating the
renin­angiotensin system to lower BP. Mice that are vitamin
D receptor­deficient have been shown to develop hyperten-
sion.36 Furthermore, in these vitamin D receptor­deficient
mice serum angiotensin II levels increase before the advent
of hypocalcemia and hyperparathyroidism, suggesting that
vitamin D suppression of renin production is independent of
serum PTH or calcium,36 which has been confirmed by direct
observation.37
There are some limitations to our study. Due to the nature
of the cross-sectional design, the associations detected may
not be a cause­effect relationship; and other confounding fac-
tors may be present which were not controlled in the analyses.
Another limitation is that only one set of measurements was
made for each participant, which is likely to have resulted in
random errors during measurements. However, these errors
may have weakened the observed associations that BP has with
PTH and 25(OH)D.
In summary, we have found that vitamin D status has a sta-
tistically inverse association with systolic BP, but not diasto-
lic BP, after adjusting for PTH; and that the association with
systolic BP is no longer significant when adjusting for both
PTH and BMI. Most of the human evidence to date, includ-
ing our study, is from observational studies, and it is possible
that uncontrolled confounders explain this inverse associa-
tion. Recent meta-analyses of randomized­controlled trials
have reported that vitamin D supplementation has no effect on
diastolic BP, but have been inconsistent with regard to its effect
on systolic BP.38,39 Further evidence from randomized­con-
trolled trials is required before clinicians can be certain that
vitamin D lowers BP.
