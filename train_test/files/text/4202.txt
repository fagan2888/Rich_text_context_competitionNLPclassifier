Objective and Purpose
Higher education1 in Ghana has recently seen remarkable
growth in various frontages--widening access and participa-
tion, expansion of academic facilities, transformative policy
environment that has led to the growth of private sector par-
ticipation, innovative funding approaches to increase the
financial sustainability of institutions, and so on. Universities
in Ghana have become attractive to students from other
countries, particularly in SSA. Public universities in Ghana
are internationally recognized in terms of the quality of pro-
grams offered, teaching, research, and knowledge transfer.
Several public universities, have well-developed interna-
tional programs and partnerships with leading institutions
such as Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, giving more credibility
to their academic programs. However, in spite of these over-
whelming developments, there remain inequalities in the
Higher Education system in Ghana; access has not been
broadened to include all social groups. Available data sug-
gest unequal distribution of higher education among women,
minorities, individuals from low socioeconomic status, and
spatial-based disparities. Using enrollment data from univer-
sities, policy document from the Ministry of Education
(MOE), and the National Council for Tertiary Education
(NCTE) in Ghana, and academic research reports, the authors
provide descriptive and critical analyses of higher education
disparities in Ghana. The authors provide a brief anatomy of
the tertiary education in Ghana, followed by a descriptive
examination of the various levels of inequalities that have
persisted in the system with particular reference to access
and participation--disparity based on students' socioeco-
nomic status, gender-based disparities, regions of origin, and
the type or location of secondary schools. The authors utilize
the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve concepts to explain the
levels of disparity in tertiary education in Ghana.
Overview of Higher Education in Ghana
Tertiary education in Ghana dates back to the early 1940s
when Mr. Justice Asquith was appointed by the British gov-
ernment to investigate the principles that will guide the
establishment of universities in the Colonies in 1943 (Daniel,
1997). Historically, the British model of education
bequeathed to Ghana like many Sub-Saharan African (SSA)

A Descriptive Assessment of Higher
Education Access, Participation, Equity,
and Disparity in Ghana
Francis Atuahene1 and Anthony Owusu-Ansah2
Abstract
Since independence, Ghana has comparatively distinguished itself among many Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries in its
educational developments. Tertiary education in Ghana over the past decade has witnessed tremendous growth in various
frontages--increased access and participation, relative expansion of academic facilities, a growing private sector, and most
importantly, a transformative policy environment. Despite these overwhelming developments, there remain inequalities in the
higher education system in Ghana: access has not been broadened to include all social groups. Available data suggest unequal
participation among women, minorities, individuals from low socioeconomic backgrounds, and spatial-based disparities. Using
enrollment data from universities, policy document from the Ministry of Education, and the National Council for Tertiary
Education in Ghana, and academic research reports, the authors provide descriptive and critical analyses of the structures of
inequalities and disparities in higher education in Ghana. The authors argue that in spite of the massive developments over
the years, there exist accessibility and participation gap with respect to students' socioeconomic status, gender, regions of
origin, and the type and location of secondary schools attended.

countries was designed to educate an elite corps who will
gradually take up roles in the civil service played by expatri-
ates (MOE, 2008). The first Higher education institution
established in Ghana was the University College of Gold
Coast in 1948 and later renamed the University of Ghana
(UG) after independence in 1957. By the close of the 1980s,
there were three public universities in Ghana (UG, the
Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology
[KNUST], and the University of Cape Coast [UCC]). In
addition, there were other professional institutions offering
postsecondary programs in the country. Starting with a few
100 students during its inaugural ceremony in 1948, student
enrollment at the UG rose to 9,000 in 1976 and remained at
this level until the government issued a white paper in 1991
on the reforms to the Tertiary Education System, a precursor
of the report of the University Rationalization Committee
(URC). The URC undertook a comprehensive review of
postsecondary education in the country and came out with
detailed proposals designed to overhaul the education system
(MOE, 2008). The recommendations of the URC provided
the basis for innovation in higher education. The committee
recommended among other things, strategies to expand
access particularly for the poor and female students; the cre-
ation of a new University in the northern part of Ghana;
upgrading of the existing polytechnics into tertiary education
status under the Polytechnic Law (PNDC; Provisional
National Defense Council Law 321 in 1992). Another impor-
tant recommendation by the URC report was the unification
of all postsecondary educational institutions into a single,
unified, and coordinated system with greater public account-
ability (Republic of Ghana, 2002). While the URC acknowl-
edged that the Government cannot exclusively finance higher
education, the report recommended that universities embark
on innovative financial diversification approaches such as
the introduction of cost-sharing and cost-recovery mecha-
nisms, while tuition remained constitutionally free. These
major developments led to massive expansion of access and
participation between 1990s and 2000s. Prior to 1993, enroll-
ment of the three public universities was 14,500, and by
2002 this had increased to 86,570, and then to 121,390 in
2005 (Adu & Orivel, 2006, cited in World Bank, 2011).
Over the past two decades, the number of tertiary institu-
tions in Ghana has grown positively, particularly private
institutions. And by 2012, there were more than 126 public
and private universities accredited by the National
Accreditation Board (NAB) in Ghana. Of these, there are 6
public universities, 49 private universities--two of which are
chartered and have been given presidential authority to
award degrees, 38 Teacher Training Colleges (TTCs) that
have been upgraded to university status, 18 Nursing Training
Colleges, and 10 Polytechnics. In addition to these, there are
several private universities that have not received accredita-
tion, but running several postsecondary education programs
in the country. In the public universities, the enrollment
growth rate has not reflected the proportionate expansion in
academic facilities to ensure equity, and inclusion of all
social groups. For example, during the period between 1990
and 2004, the average annual growth rate reached 18% for all
tertiary institutions combined, and 16% for universities alone
(World Bank, 2011). During the 2006-2007 academic year,
the total enrollment in the tertiary sector was just more than
135,000. At the polytechnic level, enrollment increased from
about 1,900 in 1990-1991 to about 45,000 in 2008-2009
(Effah, 2011). These developments are due to various poli-
cies adopted by the Government to enhance higher education
in Ghana. Another example is the policy of differentiation
being implemented to allow accreditation of some polytech-
nics to run select bachelor's degree programs, thereby reduc-
ing pressure on universities to expand access and participation
(Effah, 2011). In spite of this growth, universities and poly-
technics are not fully equipped with the required infrastruc-
ture to admit the number of qualified students seeking
participation. Every year, many qualified students are denied
access to tertiary education due to limited institutional
facilities.
Access, Participation, and Equity
As indicated hereinbefore, public tertiary education in Ghana
was initially developed as residential institutions because of
their national character and the model adopted from the met-
ropolitan institutions in Britain (Republic of Ghana, 2002).
Admission to any of the public universities in Ghana is influ-
enced by the availability of academic and residential facili-
ties, as well as Government subsidies to institutions. With the
growing demand for participation and the unequaled pace of
expansion in residential facilities, access to higher education
is determined by available capacities of universities and
polytechnics. Although, enrollment increased from as low as
14,500 prior to 1993 to 179,998 during 2009-2010, and then
rose to 201,153 during 2010-2011 academic years, there
remain greater percentage of students who are excluded from
participating in tertiary education.2 Between 2009-2010 and
2011-2012 academic years, the participation rate at universi-
ties increased by 57%, while polytechnics registered an
impressive enrollment rate of 21.4%. Presently, universities
are filled beyond reasonable capacity, and many academi-
cally qualified students are denied admission. The lack of
adequate academic and residential facilities means that uni-
versities have to embark on highly selective admission pro-
cedures. For instance, enrollment trend at the UG provides
an exposé of the accessibility challenge facing public univer-
sities in Ghana. In 2001, the total number of applications (see
Figures 1 and 2) received by the UG was 6,268, of which
2,659 (i.e., 42%) were qualified and 2,550 were admitted to
study in various programs (representing an acceptance rate
of 96%, see Figure 2). However, this trend began to change
as the number of applications increased in successive years.
In 2011, for example, the total number of qualified applicants
was 12,702 (i.e., 85% of total applications). Out of this, only
Atuahene and Owusu-Ansah 3
52% of the qualified applicants were admitted to study in
various programs. The status of the 48% of students who
were denied admission remains unknown. It is possible that
some of the qualified students may have been accepted into
other tertiary institutions in the country, because in practice,
students usually apply to multiple institutions. As Eshiwani
(1999) indicated, although the expansion of access to higher
education led to training of the required manpower capacity
needs of most African countries in the earlier days of inde-
pendence, "the current growth exceeds the capacity of
African economies to meet the high demand for university
education" (p. 33). However, the fact that many students are
faced with the challenge of accessing universities and pro-
grams of their choice due to limited academic facilities
means that Ghana is potentially underutilizing a greater per-
centage of its human resource capacity.
Moreover, in discussing access and participation issues, it
is important to note that globally, higher education accessibil-
ity is becoming a major national concern for all countries.
While enrollment has increased at the primary and secondary
education levels, similar trends have not been witnessed at the
postsecondary levels. Over the past three decades, the number
of students attending postsecondary education has increased
from five to six million resulting in tertiary enrollment annual
average growth rate of 8.6% with SSA recording the highest
participation growth rate (United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization Institute for Statistics
[UNESCO-UIS], 2009). Available statistics show that in SSA,
enrollment rose by an annual growth rate of 10% between
2000 and 2005 (UNESCO-UIS, 2009). Nonetheless, there
remains a huge gap between the secondary and tertiary Gross
Enrollment Ratios (GER) in the region. For example, the
upper secondary and tertiary GER were 19% and 4% in 1999,
which increased to 27% and 6% in 2008, respectively
(UNESCO-UIS, 2010). In 2006, Nigeria which is the most
populous country in Africa registered a primary GER of 96%,
secondary GER of 32%, and tertiary GER of 10%.
Alternatively, Kenya's GER within the same period was 96%
for primary education, 49% for secondary, and 6% for tertiary.
In Ghana, the secondary Net Enrollment Ratio (NER) in 2007
was 45% while tertiary GER was 6% (World Bank, 2011).
Comparing these statistics with a non-African country, India,
for instance, registered 112% primary GER, 54% secondary
and 12% tertiary, which was even higher than the combined
GER of all SSAcountries of 95% primary, 32% secondary and
5% tertiary (World Bank, 2011). As shown in Table 1, it is
instructive that the problem of access at the university is also a
transition and progression issue from the pretertiary levels.
The primary GER of 94.9% compared with Junior and Senior
High GER of 80.6% and 33.9%, respectively, show a transi-
tion problem from primary to secondary education levels,
which definitely affects the transition and progression to the
tertiary education level. For example, during 2008-2009, the
male to female primary GER was 97% to 92.8% compared
with the respective GER of 83.9% and 77% at the Junior High
School, and male to female GER of 36.7% to 30.8% at the
Senior High School levels, respectively. Clearly, by the time
students graduate from High School, a greater percentage of
them would have dropped out. As a point of banality, one can
candidly remark that if retention rates at the pretertiary educa-
tion increases, and if many students were to qualify for univer-
sities, the existing institutional capacities will definitely be
inadequate for such massive demands. The worse-case sce-
nario would be either institutions overstretch their capacities
and accept more students, which will potentially affect quality
or completely deny some students admission.

Furthermore, while the GER at the Senior High School
level is lower for boys and girls, the trend depicted in Table 1
shows that as attrition of female students increases, their par-
ticipation to higher education will be comparatively lower
than that of male students. Similarly, the World Bank (2011)
reported that while Junior High School GER reached 79.5 in
2009, the current estimated transition rate from Junior to
Senior High School is 35% to 40%.
While high drop-out rates at the Junior High School
accounts for the low Senior Secondary School GER, other
socioeconomic and institutional factors, as well as high fail-
ure rates in the Basic Education Certificate Examination
(BECE) play a major role in students'transition and progres-
sion between Junior and Senior High School levels (MOE,
2009; World Bank, 2011). For example, a report on the 2011
BECE by the West Africa Examination Council (WAEC)
revealed that, most of the students who took the exam per-
formed abysmally as compared with the previous years,
leading to most students not being able to obtain admission
into the Senior High Schools. It was noted in the WAEC
report that most schools scored below 50% in the exam. In
central region alone about 77 schools scored 0% in the exam.
It is important to note that while generally tertiary education
in Ghana has relatively seen expansion in the number of stu-
dents attending, unfortunately, not all groups have benefited
proportionately from the recent expansion. Ensuring partici-
pation for women remains a major policy snag for universi-
ties, although there have been efforts to bridge this gap.
Gender-Based Disparity in Higher
Education
Gender-based disparity in education as argued by Assié-
Lumumba (2008) ". . . is one of the areas that differentiates
economically advanced from developing countries" (p. 18).
Although SSAwitnessed more than 66% increase in the num-
ber of students attending tertiary education between 1999 and
2005, access to the relevant age group remains relatively low
with an average GER of 5% in 2005 (UNESCO-UIS, 2008).
While the global Gender Parity Index (GPI) increased to 1.05
in 2005, the average tertiary GPI in SSA decreased from 0.68
in 1999 to 0.62 in 2005. Whereas gender disparities favoring
men substantially increased in some countries such as the
Congo, the Gambia, Lesotho, and Nigeria, women's partici-
pation in tertiary education improved significantly in Burkina
Faso, Ethiopia, Malawi, and the United Republic of Tanzania
(UNESCO, 2008).
Overall higher education access for female students has
not seen much improvement despite the general consensus
about the need to correct gender-based disparity (Figure 3).
One often-cited reason for the low participation rate of
females in African universities is the misguided colonial
educational policy, which did not have specific place for
women in higher education. Historically, the colonial higher
education model for which Africa traces its modern universi-
ties was primarily designed to educate males who will pro-
vide administrative assistance to the colonial government,
thus universities did not have any voice or important place
for women (Assié-Lumumba, 2008; Mama, 2003). This
practice did not change during the immediate years after
independence as most first- and second-generation African
leaders did not proactively make plans to improve women
participation in higher education, thereby perpetuating the
long-standing inequity. As Mama argued,
African governments have not formally excluded women from
participation in higher education as the colonial policies did, but
"they have tended to treat the attainment of nation-statehood as
a collective restoration of conventional masculinity . . . which
has precluded full and equal participation of women in the
national project. (p. 102)
In Ghana, access to and participation in higher education
by females has generally improved numerically over the past
few decades, but disparity persists between male students.

Female participation rate in 1999 was about 25% of the total
enrollment, which increased to 37% in 2011 representing
about 154% increase from the total enrollment in 2005. By all
indication, female participation has increased over the years,
but is relatively lower than that of male students' representa-
tion in the tertiary education system. The increase in enroll-
ment is high in the polytechnics, private universities, and
professional institutes. For example, the percentage of enroll-
ment in private universities and professional institutes rose
from 4% to almost 20% in the last 4 years (MOE, 2008; World
Bank, 2011). Probably, the entry requirements are less com-
petitive than those in the universities (Morley, Gunawardena,
Kwesiga, Lihamba, & Odejide, 2006; Morley, Leach, &
Lugg, 2009; Morley, Lihamba, Mwaipopo, Forde, & Egbenya,
2010).According to Daddieh (2003), ". . . the growing gender
gap in enrollment and retention remains one of the more vex-
ing issues facing the Ghanaian education system" (p. 12).
Ghana has evidently seen an impressive increase in its
higher education with Gross Enrollment Ratio increasing from
2.92 in 1999 to 12.14 in 2011, but equality and equity between
female and male students have not been achieved, as the pro-
portion of male to female student remains unequal. In 1999,
the tertiary GPI was 0.35, by 2004 it was 0.79, and then
dropped to 0.45 in 2008, but rose 0.62 in 2011. The education
Lorenz Curve in Figure 4, for example, provides a further esti-
mation of how Ghana is lagging in achieving gender parity or
equality in its tertiary education system. As a measure of
equality, the Lorenz curve maps the cumulative educational
share against the cumulative population share ordered from
the least represented in the tertiary education to the most rep-
resented on the y- and x-axes, respectively (d'Hombres, 2010).
The Lorenz curve provides a geometric representation of edu-
cational inequalities. The 45° diagonal line differentiates the
Lorenz curve. As depicted by the Lorenz Curve in Figure 4,
the relationship between cumulative proportions, its initial and
final points have coordinates (0, 0) and (1, 1), respectively. If
each gender group had the same enrollment distribution, the
Lorenz Curve would be equal to the equality line. As enroll-
ment distribution between female and male students is not
equal, the Lorenz Curve falls below the equidistribution line.
The surface of the area between the 45° line, along with which
enrollment distribution of both social groups (male and
female) is the same on the Lorenz curve, determines the degree
of inequality in the enrollment distribution and participation.
The bigger the surface, the more unequal the educational dis-
tribution and however, the larger the distance of the curve
from the diagonal line, the larger the inequality. From Figure
4, it is evidenced that educational inequalities exist between
male and female students with access favoring male students
who are closer to the equidistribution line.
Various systemic factors have been cited to explain gen-
der-based inequities in higher education in Ghana. Ironically,
some of the factors that were discussed over a decade ago in
a study by Daddieh (2003) were observed in recent studies
(such as Morley et al., 2009; Morley et al., 2010). Among the
factors causing the high rate of gender-disparity are Socio-
cultural considerations, gendered social practices within
households, financial difficulties associated with women edu-
cation, lack of role models for girls in schools, and hostile
school environment, which has been documented as sexual
harassments from male students, inadequate institutional
facilities, and so on. Socioeconomically, poor parents tend to
sacrifice their girls' education in favor of males when they
have to make the financial decision to send only one child to
school. Culturally, in most rural areas when family budget is
tight, there is the entrenched perception of parents sacrificing
their daughters' education and request of them to participate
in economic activities to supplement household income. Girls
are more likely than males to support their family either by
engaging in selling goods and services or babysitting their
younger siblings especially in the rural areas. As articulated
by Daddieh, ". . . negative parental attitudes and cultural prac-
tices have tended to devalue female educational achieve-
ments, and thereby undermine their educational participation"
(Daddieh, 2003, p. 23). Although the negative perception
about the value of women's education is gradually fading
away in the Ghanaian society, some culturally endemic areas
continue to perpetuate binary gender roles which have
reduced women to household chores--a notion perceived tra-
ditionally, as the proper role and place of women in society.
Moreover, the high female drop-out rate at the primary
and secondary education levels can generally be attributed to
factors which include: financial stress and Socio-cultural
constraints--early customary marriages, teenage pregnancy;
unfavorable school environment such as poor sanitary facili-
ties (e.g., toilets), lack of female role models, parents' level
of education, high incidence of poverty in the family cause
early labor entrance by children, and so on (Casely-Hayford,
2011, United Nations Children's Fund [UNICEF], 2010). In

marriage and teenage pregnancy as the causes of student
dropouts. A study by Morley et al. (2007) found that female
students drop out from primary school because some face
unbridled sexually aggressive gestures from male students. A
similar report by the World Bank (2011) accounted that pri-
mary school dropouts are predominantly high for girls espe-
cially those from disproportionately rural settings and poorer
households. Moreover, girls in deprived and nondeprived
districts more consistently drop out of Junior High Schools
than boys. Academically, a comparison of male and female
pass rates (see Figures 5 and 6) at the 2006 and 2009 West
Africa Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE)
show that in all subjects taken at the Senior High School
entrance examinations, male students outperformed their
female counterparts. As admission to the higher education
institution depends on students' success in the WASSCE, it
comes as no surprise that male students have a better chance
at success to enter the university.
Another important factor that impacts students' participa-
tion in higher education is their families' socioeconomic
background. Historically, postcolonial African leaders per-
ceived the development of tertiary-level skills as essential to
upward mobility in the labor force and a measure of social
and economic progression (Assié-Lumumba, 2008). Socially,
parents' educational backgrounds largely determine their
economic and financial sustainability and their ability to
positively contribute toward their children's education.
Particularly, a mother's level of education impacts her chil-
dren's attendance and performance in school (UNESCO,
2011). However, most often financial hardship militates
against women's ability to pursue higher education, thereby
affecting their contributions to their children's education.
Instead of being in school, children in the rural areas in par-
ticular are made to work to support family income. In the
extreme cases, girls from low socioeconomic backgrounds
either get married too early or some of them become victims
of sexual abuse, which could potentially lead to teenage
pregnancy either caused by male peers or teachers. As
Daddieh (2003) asserted,
the poverty of households often makes girls vulnerable to the
advances of so-called "sugar daddies" and even male teachers.
The resultant pregnancies exacerbated the rate of female
dropouts, because girls are almost invariably expelled from
school, but not the real culprits--the boys who got them pregnant
in the first place. (p. 26)
However, Governments continue to press for the need to
increase graduate output of female students. Various policies
have been put in place at all levels of education to correct the
historical and systemic marginalization of women. At the
basic education level, for example, the Girl-Child Unit of the
Ghana Education Service (GES) has been created to develop
and maintain strategies aimed at increasing the retention rate
of girls in Junior High Schools and ensuring their continua-
tion at the Senior High School. While the Unit has made
remarkable progress over the years, it faces several problems
such as inadequate funding by the GES in some districts to
fully support all their programs, lack of operation, and moni-
toring vehicle for easy accessibility to remote districts, lack
of motivation for hardworking coordinators in assisting
deprived areas in the district, and difficulty in mobilizing
stakeholders to improve the quality of teaching and learning
for girls. Although, gender-based disparity remains an issue
of policy concern, spatially, individuals from economically
deprived regions face more challenges in accessing higher
education than those in economically advantaged urban areas
particularly, in the cities. The following discussion focuses
on how region of residence/origin affects students' chances
of participating in higher education.

one's high school or region of residence is a major determi-
nant of access to and participation in higher education.
Statistical data across the world (UNESCO-UIS, 2009;
UNESCO-UIS, 2011) and various studies (Assié-Lumumba,
2008; Leach & Mitchell, 2006; Mama, 2003; Morley et al.,
2009; Morley et al., 2010) show that students from deprived
school districts and in particular rural areas have limited
access to quality education. Participation in higher education
depends on the location and quality of Senior High School
attended, which is also a proxy to measure ones performance
in the Senior Secondary School Examinations (SSSCE).
Performance in SSSCE/WASSCE depends on the geographi-
cal location or region of the high school, academic program,
and of course the quality of teachers in the school. Students
who have the opportunity to attend one of the top-ranked
Secondary Schools, staffed with quality teachers and com-
paratively better educational facilities tend to perform better
than their peers who attended mediocre Senior High School,
predominantly located in rural areas in historically disadvan-
taged regions of the country, which have substandard aca-
demic infrastructure or facilities. Apparently, most of the
best schools are located in the urban areas. Studies have
shown that students who attended the top-ranked Senior
High Schools dominate public universities. A study by
Addae-Mensah (2000) estimated that more than 70% of the
future doctors, scientists, engineers, architects, pharmacists,
and other professionals graduating from tertiary institutions
in Ghana came from only 18 of the country's 504 Senior
Secondary Schools. This is because only few schools are
well equipped with the facilities and quality teachers required
to implement rigorous science intensive programs.
Unfortunately, the best science schools are well-resourced
and predominantly located in the urban areas.
In a similar study, Manuh, Sulley, and Budu (2007) argued
that "the most significant factor enhancing the chances of
access to university in Ghana was the region (and indeed,
location) of residence" (p. 82). About 70% of students in the
five public universities reside in only three regions, namely,
the Greater Accra (GAR; that is, capital), Ashanti (ASH),
and Eastern Regions (ER), suggesting that students from
these regions have the best chance at gaining entry into the
university (Manuh et al., 2007). Manuh et al. study found
enrollment variations in five of the nation's publicly funded
universities and that 50% of students had come from only 29
secondary schools in the country. Available Institutional data
at the UG and Kwame Nkrumah university indicate that
enrollment in these institutions are dominated by students
from about 50 of the more than 500 Senior Secondary
Schools, with the majority of them from schools located in
economically advantaged regions of the country. A recent
study by Morley et al. (2009) found that 25% of the 2007
qualified students in Ghana were from deprived parts of the
country. Approximately 5% selected from this group was
compared with 15% from nondeprived schools. Only 1.16%
of students selected were from deprived schools compared
with 11.59% from nondeprived schools. The odds of being
admitted to any of the tertiary educational institution in
Ghana based on Morley et al. (2009) is 10 times higher for
students who had the opportunity to attend schools located in
nondeprived regions.
In expanding the analysis on the magnitude of higher edu-
cation inequities based on individuals region of residence in
Ghana, the Gini educational coefficient was employed using
the Gini Coefficient formula by Brown (1994):
Gini = - +

where Gini = Gini coefficient, X
i
= Cumulative proportion of
the regions, and Yi = Cumulative proportion of students
enrolled in universities.
As a measure of inequality, the Gini coefficient is based
on the graphical representation of the Lorenz curve of the
distribution of education by regions. The coefficient varies
between 0, which reflects complete equality and 1, which
indicates complete inequality. Increasing values of the Gini
represents level of educational inequality among regions.
The overall regional-analysis shows notable inequalities in
the distribution of higher education in Ghana. The Lorenz
curves in Figures 7a and 7b show a comparison of the trend
of educational disparity of the ten geographic regions in
Ghana from 2002 to 2010 using data of three public universi-
ties--KNUST, the UCC, and the UG. The Lorenz curves
show that tertiary education in Ghana is distributed in favor
of the top 5 regions--ASH, CR, ER, GAR, and Volta (VR).
The educational Gini coefficient in Figure 8 shows wide
variations in the distribution of tertiary education by regions
in Ghana. Statistically, the probability of getting access to
higher education is higher for individuals residing in ASH
(Gini = 0.315), CR (Gini = 0.338), ER (Gini = 0.334), GAR
(Gini = 0.325), and VR (Gini = 0.332). In 2005 and 2010,
86% and 81% of the students, respectively, enrolled in the
three public universities named the top-five regions as their
places of origin.

However, while the above analysis provides a general
assessment of all students, a comparative assessment of par-
ticipation rates by regular students (nontuition paying) with
tuition-paying students reveals similar inequalities.
Generally, admission to the universities is based on a stu-
dent's performance on the national entrance examination,
WASSCE, West Africa Senior Secondary School Certificate
Examination. Students who do not meet the universities'
competitive admission cutoff points and departmental
restrictive requirements, but who meet the minimum entry
requirements have the option to apply for admission as
tuition paying. Students who meet the competitive require-
ments are admitted on regular status. Regular students do not
pay tuition, but they pay Academic User Facility and
Residential User Facility fees, and other institutional imposed
charges. Economically, one must have the financial support
to either apply or continue as "tuition-paying" student.
Intuitively, the ability to pay depends on several factors such
as socioeconomic status, which also depends on student's
family income background, level of parents' education, and
of course the location and region of residence. The data
reveal that in both admission streams, students who are able
to participate in higher education are those from the five top
regions identified hereinbefore. By all measures, access to
higher education comes into conflict with one's socioeco-
nomic status and ability to pay.
When compared, Figures 9 and 10 show that the majority
of students who were attending the UG as regular and tuition
paying in 2011were predominantly from 5 of the 10 regions
of the country. Most important of all, the fact that participa-
tion in universities is disproportionally distributed in favor of
the economically viable regions for regular and fee-paying
students shows persistent inequity. Students from top-five

regions which are relatively considered as economically
well-resourced have better chance of accessing higher edu-
cation than their counterparts from historically disadvan-
taged regions (see Figures 9 and 10).
Socioeconomic and Financial Dimensions of
Access and Participation
One of the major and often-cited causes of educational
inequality in developing countries is students' family
background and socioeconomic status. There is no other
factor that militates against students' access to tertiary edu-
cation than their socioeconomic background, ceteris pari-
bus. Constitutionally, pretertiary education in Ghana is
tuition free, nonetheless there remain certain incidental
fees that work against students from poor socioeconomic
backgrounds especially, those in the rural areas and in par-
ticular girls. Thus, the socioeconomic status of parents is a
crucial factor in deciding whether a student stays in pri-
mary school or progresses to the next higher level of
school, and the opportunity to attend university. However,
at the primary levels, there have been several policy initia-
tives such as the school Capitation Grant Scheme intro-
duced in 2005 to eliminate school fees to expand access for
poor students. In principle, the Capitation Grant is designed
to eliminate indiscriminate charges such as fees at the
basic educational level, especially for the poor and those in
the rural settings who research had shown were not access-
ing education because of the costs, and enable schools to
utilize the available funds to improve the quality of educa-
tion (Akyeampong, 2011). These programs contributed to
increase in enrollment at the primary school for girls. The
elimination of fees also benefited the poor in remote areas.
The national primary GPI has improved from 0.93 to 0.95.
Nevertheless, as Akyeampong (2011) indicated, the
Capitation Grant Scheme instituted in Ghana is a one-time
shot approach because, at some point the enrollment
growth rate reaches a norm, and in some cases it begins to
plateau. Moreover, providing the facilities at the primary
school level without a concomitant overhaul of facilities at
the upper educational levels is a short-sighted policy goal.
Similarly, eliminating school fees as a demand-side strat-
egy to increase enrollment at the primary school level does
not in itself lead to high attendance and participation rates
(Akyeampong, 2011). Thus, although fee-free policies
have been employed in many developing countries to
improve educational access to the poor and minority stu-
dents, the results have not necessarily translated into high
attendance and completion of schooling (Akyeampong,
2009; Somerset, 2009).
Another dimension to this problem is that while higher
education in Ghana remains tuition free for regular students,
there exist several charges such as, registration fee, technol-
ogy fee, examination fee, academic facility user fee, medical
services fee, venture capital fee, and so on that make it very
expensive for individuals from low socioeconomic status to
afford the cost of participation. Realistically, government
alone cannot afford to finance higher education considering
the skyrocketing enrollment rates coupled with the increas-
ing per-unit cost of financing tertiary education. Likewise,
the present state of the Ghanaian economy means a greater
percentage of students are incapable of financing their edu-
cation without government's subsidies.
A plethora of studies (Bock & Cammish, 1997; Casely-
Hayford, 2000; Logan & Beoku-Betts, 1996; Morley et al.,
2009; World Bank, 2011) have observed that students'socio-
economic status affect their ability to access and participate
in all levels of education particularly, at the tertiary education
level. For most 4-year colleges and universities, especially
selective institutions, enrollment is contingent on students'
academic preparation at the elementary and secondary school
levels. Across the world, students from low socioeconomic
status find it difficult to enroll in selective institutions and for
those who made it through are usually academically ill-pre-
pared, although they perform competitively as their peers
from high-ranked secondary schools (Kirst, 2007).
Individual's economic background can either serve as a bar-
rier or incentive to apply to college or university because of
the cost involve in attending specific schools. However,
Tierney (1980) argued that socioeconomic status by itself
may not affect the cost of applying to specific institution for
minority students, but practically, students from low-income
status may be hesitant to apply to specific selective and elite
institutions even though they may be academically capable
(Hearn, 1984; Maguire & Lay, 1981; Tierney, 1980).
In the United States, Bowen, Kurzweil, and Tobin (2005)
asserted that low-income students are less likely to apply to
one of the group of 31 selective colleges or universities that
fall under the Consortium on Financing Higher Education
(COFHE). A similar argument was made by McPherson and
Schapiro (1991) that students from low socioeconomic back-
grounds are less likely to be admitted to COFHE and are
more averse to be accepted. Berg (2010) indicated, "statisti-
cally, the least academically qualified students from wealthy
families have as much chance of going to college as the high-
est performing kids from low-income families" (p. 55). For
economically disadvantaged students, the opportunity cost
of participating in higher education is a major economic
decision.
For many low-income Ghanaian students, the decision to
take loans for private university or apply as "full fee-paying"
if they do not meet the competitive entry requirements set by
public universities is a difficult one. Hence, there are aca-
demically competent students who for economic reasons
chose different paths to higher education. For example, in the
past some students chose TTCs for economic reasons.
Practically, there is a major incentive to attend TTC in Ghana
because, not only are TTCs tuition free, but also students
receive stipend from the government. In addition, TTC stu-
dents get employed immediately after they graduate from
10 SAGE Open
college. This is because the Government sends them to vari-
ous schools throughout the country as teachers. As observed
by Morley et al. (2009),
The subject area of Education attracted the most students from
deprived backgrounds . . . While this is an important pathway, it
is also a profession in Africa with a low exchange rate in the
labor market, thus reinforcing economic hierarchies. (p. 21)
Even though socioeconomic status is the first barrier to
higher education access for most poor students, admission
selectivity to public universities remains the second major
threat to participation. For instance, qualified students who
did not meet the university's competitive cutoff point, but are
financially capable can apply as tuition paying to participate
in university education or even apply to one of the private
institutions. However, qualified students who do not meet
the competitive admission cutoff point, but are financially
incapable dread losing the opportunity to participate in
higher education. The existing competitive entry require-
ments into universities based on achievement in WASSCE is
a major stumbling block for students from lower socioeco-
nomic backgrounds.
Available fee structure for the 1st-year regular students
enrolling in the UG for the 2012-2013 academic year ranges
from Ghanaian Cedi (GH¢) 539 (US$285) for humanities,
GH¢ 599 (US$317) for Administration/Law students, GH¢
633 (US$335) for Science including Agriculture, GH¢ 680
(US$360) for veterinary program, and GH¢ 1,082 (US$573)
medical students. At the KNUST, it is GH¢ 567.47 (US$300)
for humanities, GH¢ 646 (US$342) for Science, and GH¢
770.87 (US$408) for medicine. For students admitted as
Ghanaian-tuition-paying status, their tuition and fees is in the
range of GH¢1,800 (US$953) for social sciences and GH¢
4,000 (US$2,118) for medical school at the KNUST. At the
UG), Ghanaian tuition-paying students pay GH¢ 2,003
(US$1,077) for humanities and GH¢ 3,491(US$1,849) for
students in various applied sciences. There are variations in
tuition and fee within different programs in the same institu-
tion and among public universities. In addition to the pub-
lished fees, students are required to pay other incidentals fees
such as residential facilities user fee, and hall dues.
Nonresidential students also incur other expenses for accom-
modation, textbooks, transportation, food, personal, and mis-
cellaneous expenditures. For the average Ghanaian, and
low-income students, paying for the yearly fees in addition
to all the other incidental expenditures is an uphill struggle.
As observed by the World Bank (2011),
Higher Education in Ghana is disproportionately "consumed"
by the richest 20% of the population. Male students from the
highest income quintile (Q5) are more than seven times more
likely to enter and successfully complete HE than those from the
poorest quintile (Q1). The situation is even more precarious for
the female category where students come from only the richest
40% of the population. (p. 157)
However, instead of providing support for students from
low socioeconomic status, universities and government pol-
icy penalize students for not performing well in high school,
by rewarding the "brightest" students who had access to the
best secondary schools in the country, thereby perpetuating
inequality. Pillay (2009) contended that students from the
highest income quintiles dominate universities and "often
public funding mechanisms act to exacerbate such inequities
by providing free higher education to the `best' students who
invariably come from the wealthiest households." The case
of Ghana clearly mirrors this point where students who did
not meet the competitive admissions "cutoff points" are
admitted to pay tuition; meanwhile the majority of these stu-
dents are from either high schools with substandard facilities
or from poor socioeconomic background. Students from
poorer income quintiles
have much lower enrollment and completion rates. Students
from economically deprived households have not only fewer
chances than their rich counterparts to be enrolled in school, but
those that are have an even smaller probability of completing a
given cycle. (World Bank, 2011, p. iv)
Program-Based Disparities
Another area of inequality in higher education in Ghana is
the type of academic program that a student pursues.
Generally, there is huge disparity between the percentage of
students enrolled in the Arts- and Humanities-related pro-
grams and Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics (STEM) fields. Available statistical data show
that while women participation in higher education has
increased considerably over the past few years, there remains
a huge gap between male and females in STEM fields. Pillay
(2009) argued that although
participation rates for women in SSA is "substantially" lower
than males, where women have managed to enter higher
education, their participation is often concentrated in so-called
traditional women's disciplines such as humanities and
education, rather than in commerce, engineering, and science.
(p. 20)
In Ghana, while government policy suggests a 60:40
enrollment goal for programs in Science & Technology and
Arts & Humanities, respectively (Ministry of Education,
Science, and Sport [MOESS], 2010), enrollment trends over
the past few decades indicate that this policy goal is far from
being realized. For example, STEM and Arts and Humanities
ratio was 36:64 in 2001-2002, 35:65 in 2002-2003, and 38:62
in 2007-2008 academic years, respectively, in public univer-
sities. For the polytechnics, the ratio was 32:68 in 2006-2007
for STEM, and Arts and humanities, respectively (MOESS,
2010). The ratio of STEM to Arts/Humanities in 2010-2011
was 40:60 and 33:67 for public universities and polytechnics,
respectively, in favor of Arts/Humanities (NCTE, 2012). At
Atuahene and Owusu-Ansah 11
the UG, the percentage of students enrolled in science-related
disciplines was just 23% in 1999 and by 2006 this dropped to
17.3%. In view of this, the NCTE recommends pegging the
STEM and Arts/Humanities growth at 5% and 3%, respec-
tively (MOESS, 2010), which may take about 57 years to
reverse the present trend. However, a study by Somuah (2008)
cited in the 2010 Education Sector Performance Report indi-
cated that if Ghana wants to increase STEM education within
12 years, universities may have to peg their enrollment growth
to 8% for science-related disciplines and 0% for the Arts/
Humanities. Similarly, polytechnics have to increase science
enrollment by 6% and Arts/Humanities by 1% (MOESS,
2010). By making such proposition, the Government assumes
that student interest in pursuing Arts or Humanities may
decline in favor of STEM courses. However, the implementa-
tion of such policy prescription can potentially derail indi-
vidual's career focus as well as creating fertile grounds for
discriminatory admission practices that favor students in the
sciences. As shown in the Figure 11, the number of students
enrolled has generally increased but those in the sciences
increased by small margin. It is equally important to point out
that the KNUST and University of Mines and Technology
(UMAT) are science-based institutions, although KNUST has
over the years expanded the number of Arts and Humanities
programs offered.
At the UCC, the ratio of STEM and Arts & Humanities
ratio in 2010 was 28:72, which is below the government pro-
jected rate of 60:40. Also, when broken down by gender, the
ratio of male to female was 63:37 in Arts and Humanities and
78:22 in the STEM. Even though women usually dominate
in the Arts and Humanities fields, the data show that male
students outnumbered females in all broad fields of academic
programs in universities in Ghana.
However, the low numbers of students in STEM is not
because of lack of students' interest in science-related
disciplines, but universities do not have adequate physical
infrastructure--lack of science laboratories and workshops;
inadequate human capacity--research faculty, technicians;
lack of enforcement of Science and Technology enrollment
targets by tertiary educational institutions. At the pretertiary
education level (Senior High School) only a limited number
of schools offer rigorous General Science education because
most of the schools do not have the resources to facilitate sci-
ence and math education. As Effah (2011) posited, "there are
an insufficient number of science schools and where they do
exist, particularly in the rural areas, they do not have required
laboratories to facilitate the teaching of science and mathe-
matics" (p. 377). Several factors could explain the disparity in
the Arts & Humanities, and STEM fields. Among the notable
ones are (a) lack of academic instructors in science- and tech-
nology-related fields at the Senior High School level, (b) lack
of science and laboratory equipment at the lower educational
levels, (c) low level of morale and motivation especially for
women to pursue STEM disciplines at the secondary school
level, (d) lack of financial support for institutions to run
highly intensive science laboratories, and so on (MOESS,
2010). There is also limited number of well-trained science
and mathematics teachers at the postgraduate level to teach at
the second cycle institutions. This is even worse at the poly-
technics and private universities. Private universities tend to
gravitate toward offering programs in the Arts, Humanities,
and Social Sciences than Physical Sciences. In view of the
fact that private universities are quite, recent development
and considering that the operation of a highly intensive sci-
ence program is logistically and financially expensive, it will
be more pragmatic for these new institutions to focus on pro-
grams that do not require expensive equipment needed to run
and maintain quality STEM programs. However, the immedi-
ate consequence of this is that, universities and polytechnics
are not producing enough graduates with the skills needed to

spur technological innovation and economic growth (United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD],
2010).
In view of the deficiency faced by many of the second
cycle institutions, the Government established the national
Science Resource Center (SRC) project in 1995 in 110 Senior
Secondary Schools throughout the country. The centers were
created within a 40-km radius to bridge the gap between
well-resourced and underresourced schools. The goal was to
help students in school who do not have science laboratories
for rigorous science programs to have access to the SRC
through weekly visits to the centers. The advantage of this
model was to create one center that will serve a greater per-
centage of students instead of having to establish one for
each school, which was financially impossible. While the
centers have contributed to teaching and learning of science,
most of the centers have experienced various forms of fund-
ing and logistical challenges such as transportation for shut-
tling students to the centers, limited number and type of
equipment available in the centers, maintenance of equip-
ment, and so on (World Bank, 2007).
Realizing the challenges faced by some of the centers, the
MOE in 2011 contracted with Educational Training
Equipment (Eduteq) to upgrade facilities in 200 schools to
enhance the SRC Projects. As at the end of 2012, the first
phase of this project was completed with the installation of
equipment in 83 centers, while the remaining 117 are sched-
uled for installation in 2013. The strength of the nation's sci-
ence, technology, and innovation base depends on the quality
of education and training in science and mathematics in basic
and second cycle schools to produce the number of students
who are well prepared for courses in science, mathematics,
engineering, and technology at the polytechnics and universi-
ties (Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology
[MEST], 2010). Cognizance of this need, government current
policy projects to ensure that, 60% of all students in the public
universities and 80% of those in the polytechnics and voca-
tional institutions will enroll in science-related disciplines by
the year 2020. Efforts are being made to promote postgradu-
ate education in scientific disciplines targeting 10% of the
student population in tertiary educational institutions enroll-
ing at the postgraduate level, and provide incentives for stu-
dents and graduates of science and technology (MEST, 2010).
Program-based disparity is not only restricted to students,
but it is evident within the teaching and academic staff.
Available statistical data from the NCTE (see Figure 12)
show huge gender-disparity among faculty members. Using
data from the UCC and the NCTE, there were 3,105 full-time
teaching faculty representing 545 (17.6%) females and 2,560
(82.4%) of males.
Undoubtedly, the male faculty and staff far exceed their
female colleagues even in the so-called traditional fields
where society has prescribed as the fitting academic disci-
plines for women. Areas such as the arts, humanities, social
sciences, and education are all male dominated. By all
standards, the human resource capacity, particularly at the
university level is persistently masculine; the ratio of male to
female in support services is 5:1. Tettey (2010) argued that
the low proportion of female postgraduate students is a chal-
lenge to faculty regeneration for universities.
The foregoing discussions have revealed that higher educa-
tion in Ghana over the past two or so decades has witnessed
different levels of developments. Governments have provided
the financial support to expand access and participation, uni-
versities have introduced several policies to improve their
financial diversification approaches; universities are also
streamlining their admission processes, and have introduced
affirmative action policies and quota system to increase female
participation, as well as reserving admission slots for students
from historically deprived Senior High Schools. However,
various factors such as gender, region of origin, location of
high school, and socioeconomic status of students continue to
challenge students' ability to access and participate in higher
education. Nonetheless, there still remain several policy initia-
tives designed by the Government and institutions to broaden
accessibility and participation for females, minorities, and
individuals from historically disadvantaged regions.
Policies Initiatives and Way Forward
The first policy initiative addresses spatial-based disparity.As
part of efforts to provide opportunities for students who
attended high schools in the rural areas, public universities in
Ghana have been accepting students from institutions that
have been identified by the GES as the Less-Endowed
Secondary Schools (LESS) and who meet the minimum entry
requirements set by universities. Under the present competi-
tive admission standards established by universities, some of
these students may not have been accepted into the university.
The UG, for example, has been admitting students from LESS

since 2003, and some have been awarded with scholarships.
Available data from the UG's Office of Financial Aid show
that between 2005 and 2011 the total number of financial aid
applications received by the university was 1,736, comprising
1,579 (91%) males and 156 (9%) females. Of this, 90 (58%)
of the total female applicants were awarded scholarship com-
pared with the 902 (57%) of the total male applicants. At the
UCC, the Joint Admission Board identifies students from the
LESS and admits them to pursue various programs.
Another important development is the creation of the reme-
dial science program, the mature students' entrance examina-
tions by the UCC, and the concessionary selections of students
from deprived schools identified by the Joint Admissions
Board. This program accepts applications from students who
did not meet the highly selective admission requirements, but
demonstrated the potential to succeed in higher education.
Students who participate in this program are brought to the
university to take remedial classes and take final examina-
tions. Successful students are accepted to pursue various aca-
demic programs of their interest.Available data from the UCC
indicates that during the 2008-2009 academic year, the univer-
sity admitted about 80 students from a number of deprived
areas from the several LESS in the country. At the KNUST,
the former Vice Chancellor, Professor Adarkwa in his
Matriculation address indicated that during 2007-2008 aca-
demic year, a total of 243 students (representing 3.5% of the
total admission) comprising 183 males and 60 females were
offered admissions under the LESS protocol (Adarkwa, 2007).
However, during 2011-2012 admission year, the KNUST
received 27,459 applications of which 18,640 of the applicants
were qualified by admission criteria. In all, 12,008 students
comprising 7,947 males and 4,061 females were admitted.
However, due to admission competitiveness and the lowering
of cutoff points for all academic programs, the university was
not able to admit students from the LESS.
In addition to the above policies and programs, affirma-
tive action policies have been instituted in university admis-
sion since the mid-1990s as a corrective measure of the
long-standing historical gender-based disparities. To correct
this problem, universities have adopted various quota poli-
cies such as lowering the admission cutoff points by 1 point
for female students in various programs. "What this meant
was that if admissions for a program stopped at aggregate 12,
all girls with that aggregate were guaranteed admission, or if
there was space for one aggregate below the cutoff, it was
filled with women" (Tagoe, 2008, unnumbered document).
At the UCC, as a result of the affirmative action policy the
University increased its female enrollment from 2,091 dur-
ing 1999-2000 to 5,198 during 2010-2011 representing an
increase of 145% over a period of 11 years. During 2006-
2007 academic year, the university admitted a total of 3,870
undergraduate students comprising 2,417 (62.5%) males and
1,453 (37.5%) females out of a total of almost 16,000 candi-
dates who applied for admission to the University (Morley
et al., 2007).
Moreover, to address the socioeconomic-based disparity,
the MOE approved the Capitation Grant Scheme in 2005 to
eliminate school fees for all basic schools. Through its suc-
cessful pilot implementation in 2004, it was observed that
eliminating school fees bridged the gender gaps in basic
schools. For instance as a result of the Capitation Grant pro-
grams, enrollment at the Kindergarten rose from about
500,000 during 2004-2005 to more than 800,000 during
2005-2006 academic years, representing an increase of 67%
within a period of one academic year.3 At the same time, pri-
mary education showed expansion of female enrollment with
an increase in the net enrollment rate from 59.1% during
2004-2005 to 68.8%, while that at the junior secondary level
increased from 31.6% to 41.6% (United Nations Girls'
Education Initiative [UNGEI]). The increase in enrollment
was particularly higher for girls than for boys, thus further
narrowing gender gaps. The national primary GPI has also
improved from 0.93 to 0.95.3 Although this policy has not
impacted the completion and graduation rates, the plethora
of data available show its immediate success, particularly for
the poor and people from the rural areas of the country.
Concluding Remarks
Higher education in Ghana has seen outstanding develop-
ment relating to accessibility and participation. Within a
period of 15 years, tertiary education enrollment increased
from below 9,997 in 1992 to more than 132,000 in 2010,
representing an increase 1,300% (13-fold). Female enroll-
ment has seen considerable degree of improvement with a
GER of 1.52% in 1999 to 9.24% in 2011, although male
enrollment increased from 4.28% to 14.92%, respectively.
Ghana has made positive and impressive progress toward
increasing access to education and narrowing gender gaps at
the pretertiary education levels, yet these developments have
not trickled down to the tertiary education level. Disparities
persist among gender, rich and poor, location and regions of
origin, academic programs, and the type of high school a stu-
dent attended.
Whereas providing access to higher education to all qual-
ified Ghanaians is financially impossible, there are certain
policies that could be streamlined to address the huge dis-
parity rates. The first point of departure is a massive review
of the "full fee-paying" policy being implemented by uni-
versities alongside the student loan scheme. Generally, most
Ghanaians have come to realize that tertiary education can
no longer subsist under the socialist agenda, although cur-
rent developments show that tertiary education is indeed not
completely free. Economically, there remains a small per-
centage of the Ghanaian population who are financially
capable of paying tuition fee, but financially, the majority of
the students will not be able to afford it. Psychologically, for
students to embrace the idea of paying tuition for their edu-
cation at the university level, they should be given enough
loans to cover the cost of tuition, as well as other charges
14 SAGE Open
such as academic and residential facility user fees, and so
on. The implementation of the present student loan scheme,
where all students, irrespective of their socioeconomic sta-
tus are given the same amount is an affront to cost-sharing
mechanisms. Thus, any efficient cost-sharing policy must be
accompanied by a corresponding student loan scheme that is
designed to expand access and participation. Moreover,
there should be a well-established need-based financial aid
scheme that provides support for needy students. However,
the efficiency of a need-based student loan scheme depends
on the availability of accurate and reliable national database.
The current need-based assessment compiled by the Student
Loan Trust Fund (SLTF) statistically lacks validity and reli-
ability as it is based on self-reported data from students.
Another important consideration is borrowers aversion to
loans. Providing huge loan amount to students does not
eliminate the psychological fear of repayment after gradua-
tion especially with the present rate of unemployment.
Universities have to reevaluate their curricular to prepare
students with the skills needed for self-employment and the
knowledge-based economy. When students are positive
about getting employment on graduation, borrowing for
their education will be evaluated based on the social and
private returns to their investment than the debt they accu-
mulated while attending college.
Furthermore, affirmative action and quota policies are
perceived as some of the alternative policy initiatives
designed to address educational inequities and disparities.
Opponents have criticized this idea as reverse discrimination
against male students. However, in the Ghanaian society,
universities should be encouraged to raise the acceptance
rates for students from LESS regardless of the level of com-
petition in a given admission year particularly, for female
applicants. This should be continued until such a time that
the country achieves gender parity at the higher education
level. While admitting academically underprepared students,
university should consider establishing academic support
centers that will offer remedial support services for students
who may not be ready for college.
Another important policy development that has impacted
higher education participation in Ghana is the upgrading of
polytechnics and TTCs into tertiary education status. To
complement this initiative however, there is the need for
efficient national curriculum development to established
institution-wide articulation agreement to enhance easy
transfer of credits from one tertiary education to another.
This will not only provide credibility to the academic pro-
grams offered by the polytechnics, but also an easy route for
students to enter the tertiary education system while reduc-
ing the pressure on public universities. In addition, it will
enable the country to reconstitute higher education into a
single unified system. While granting polytechnics the
accreditation to run selected bachelor's degree programs is a
novel policy idea, this arrangement should not replace the
existence of efficient articulation agreement that builds
strong partnerships among colleges, polytechnics, and
universities.
In conclusion, higher education access and participation in
Ghana is stratified by four equity concerns: gender-based dis-
parity, socioeconomic status, spatial disparity, and program-
based disparity. The available data suggest that higher
education is inequitably distributed in favor of males, and
individuals from upper income bracket. Data from the Ghana
Living Survey indicate that higher education in Ghana is
dominated by 67% of individuals from the richest quintile
and 10% from the poorest two quintiles. Students from rural
areas and regions with deprived economic and social infra-
structure do not have equal access to tertiary education as stu-
dents from relatively economically endowed regions such as
ASH, ER, GAR, and CR. However, universities have devel-
oped various strategies to address the equity problems.

Notes
1. In this paper, higher education is used interchangeably with
tertiary and postsecondary education. In Ghana, Tertiary edu-
cation comprises of education provided by universities, poly-
technics, colleges, and professional institutes.
2. Reasons for exclusion may include: not meeting the restrictive
and competitive admission requirements set by the universi-
ties and departments; not having the financial support to apply
as tuition paying or one of the private universities. Although
higher education is theoretically tuition fee, there are several
charges that make it quite expensive for students without
strong family support. Besides, almost all the public universi-
ties in Ghana are concentrated in the main urban cities, which
favor students who either live in the cities or have strong urban
ties. The cost of living in these urban cities is very high.
