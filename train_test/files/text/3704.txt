Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the effect of dynamic long leg casting in paediatric patients with
developmental dysplasia of hip (DDH) diagnosed at 12­18 months.
Methods: The adductor tenotomy, closed reduction, and dynamic long leg casting method was
adopted to treat paediatric patients with DDH. The hips were divided into four groups according
to the Tonnis radiographic dislocation classification. Groups were also classified according to the
baseline acetabular index (AI): 30­35, 36­40, and > 40. The outcomes of the reductions were
evaluated according to McKay's hip function criteria and Severin's radiological criteria.
Results: A total of 246 patients (339 hips) had complete follow-up data. After 3 months of
orthosis fixation, the results were satisfactory in 264 hips (77.88%). Hip function was rated as
`excellent' or `good' in 43 of 51 (84.31%) Tonnis type 1 hips, 125 of 155 (80.65%) type 2 hips, 70 of
90 (77.78%) type 3 hips, and 34 of 43 (79.07%) type 4 hips. The higher the baseline AI, the lower the
rates of `excellent' and `good' hip function. Favourable radiological results (Severin types I and II)
were found in 266 of 339 (78.47) hips.
Conclusions: Dynamic long leg casting is an effective method for treating patients with DDH aged
12­18 months at diagnosis.

increasingly more surgeons advocate an
early operation,1 but reports on the long-
term effects of the conservative treatment for
patients older than 12 months are very rare.2
As a noninvasive treatment method, conser-
vative treatment results in less trauma, so it
is easier for patients and their families to
accept, but the applicable age has been a
controversial issue.3 To date, a number of
different types of conservative treatment
have been used, such as frog fixation and
human position fixation.4 The traditional
method was often utilized to fix hips in an
abduction and buckling position.4
Furthermore, some surgeons have devel-
oped modified methods based on the trad-
itional treatment.3 The aim of this present
study was to determine the outcome of the
adductor tenotomy, closed reduction, and
dynamic long leg casting method in infants
with DDH diagnosed between the ages of 12
and 18 months.
Patients and methods
Study population
This retrospective study reports the out-
comes for the period between January 1993
and July 2004, in which the adductor tenot-
omy, closed reduction, and dynamic long leg
casting method was adopted to treat
consecutive paediatric patients with DDH
aged 12- to 18-months old in the
Department of Paediatric Orthopaedics,
Shengjing Hospital of China Medical
University, Shenyang, Liaoning Province,
China. Completed follow-up data were
available for a proportion of these patients.
All patients met the following inclusion
criteria: (i) they suffered from simple hip
dislocation that was not associated with
other congenital malformations; (ii) they
were aged from 12 to 18 months old when
treatment was started; (iii) they did not
receive treatment before hospitalization.
Infants with dislocation of the hip caused
by inflammation, spasticity, spinal bifida,
arthroereisis and Down's syndrome, and a
dislocation of the hip associated with other
malformations, were excluded.
Ethic approval was provided by the
Ethics Committee of Shengjing Hospital of
China Medical University (no. 201409871)
and written informed consent was provided
by the legally authorized representatives of
the paediatric patients. Patients were divided
into three groups according to the
acetabular index (AI) before treatment: a
30­35group; a 36­40group; and a > 40
group. The acetabular index is the angle
formed by a horizontal line connecting both
triradiate cartilages (Hilgenreiner's line) and
a second line connecting the acetabular roof
and the acetabular centre. According to the
Tonnis classification of the radiological
grades of dislocation (Table 1),5 the patients
were divided into Tonnis types 1 to 4.
Study treatment
In all patients, traction was implemented
before reduction. For patients suffering
from Tonnis types 1 and 2 dislocations,
this included double lower limb suspension
skin traction. For patients classified as
Tonnis types 3 and 4, femoral condyle
pinning horizontal bone traction was imple-
mented with lower leg level skin traction
with a weight of 0.5 kg/6 months of age. The
traction duration was 2 weeks. For Tonnis
types 3 and 4, an X-ray examination was
performed post-traction to ensure that the
femoral head centre was pulled below the
upper margin of the acetabulum.
All patients in this study had a general
anaesthetic, adductor tenotomy and closed
reduction. General anaesthesia was admin-
istered to achieve full muscle relaxation,
and the supine position was adopted to
abduct the hip joint on the affected side to
see that the adductor was tensioned.
A scalpel was used, approaching the regio
pubica, to percutaneously cut off a large part
of the adductor tendon to relieve the
Cai et al. 273
tension, and a gauze compression haemo-
stasis and pressure dressing without suture
was applied. An assistant held the pelvis of
the infant patient in place. The surgeon
flexed the hip and knee joints to 90 and
slowly and gently implemented traction to
make the femoral head slide towards the
front inner side from the upper back of the
acetabulum. The hip abduction and external
rotation was then gradually completed. The
greater trochanter of the femur was pressed
by the thumb of the other hand, so that the
femoral head could pass through the glenoid
labrum to produce a snap to enter the
acetabulum, and in this way, the reduction
was accomplished. An intraoperative X-ray
machine was used to confirm the success of
the reduction. With both hips at 90 abduc-
tion and external rotation and 110 of flex-
ion, through which the femoral head can
return to the centre of acetabulum, dynamic
long leg casting fixation was used to fix the
limbs above the ankle joint and below the hip
joint (with the ankle joint and hip joint
exposed) and between the two lower legs,
using stick casting for the connection. Please
note that the casting at the thighs should be
slightly loose to ensure that the hip joint can
make an 80 to 110 flexion and extension
movement during the fixing period. This only
limited the straightening and adduction
motion, which could easily cause hip joint

were not limited (Figure 1a).
After discharge, patients were allowed to
make sitting, lying, standing, flexing, and
extension motions. After 3 months of fix-
ation, they returned to the hospital for cast
removal. An adjustable abductions orthosis
was fitted that only fixes the thighs and
allows the knee and ankle joints to move
freely and allows the hip joints to have a
certain amount of movement (Figures 1b
and 1c). The orthosis was removed after a
further 3 months, and then the infants were
able to walk freely. At 6-month intervals, a
pelvic X-ray examination was taken to
observe the development of the acetabulum

up database.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 15.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. The clinical criteria for the
assessment of the results at the final
follow-up visit were based on (i) McKay's
function of the hip criteria;6 and (ii) an X-
ray imaging evaluation that was carried out
according to Severin's classification
(Table 1).7 An evaluation of the presence
of avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral
head was performed according to Salter's
criteria (Table 1).8 The patients were divided
into groups based on their AI and the
Tonnis type of radiological dislocation to
form paired data. Data are presented as
mean Æ SD or n of patients. Two independ-
ent samples t-test was used for continuous
variables and 2-test was used for
categorical variables. A P-value < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 280 (381 hips) paediatric patients
with DDH who were aged 12­18-months
were enrolled in the study. Of these, 246
patients (339 hips) had complete follow-up
data available. The follow-up data were
collected over a period of 6.5­15.5 years
(mean: 9.5 years). In the 246 patients (339
hips) with complete follow-up data who
were selected for inclusion in these analyses,
the adductor tenotomy, closed reduction,
and dynamic long leg casting method was
used when they were 12­18 months old.
There were 48 males and 198 females (153
unilateral patients; 93 bilateral patients);
and the mean age was 15 months when
treatment was started. Patients were divided
into three groups according to their AI
before treatment: 106 hips in the 30­35
group; 121 hips in the 36­40 group; and
112 hips in the > 40 group. According to
the Tonnis classification, the patients were
divided into four groups: 51 hips with type 1,
155 hips with type 2, 90 hips with type 3, and
43 hips with type 4.
For 264 hips (77.88%), after 3 months of
orthosis fixation, the result was satisfactory
and no further treatment was received.
Subluxation occurred or the joint space
was increased in 75 hips after the orthosis
removal. Ideal reduction was achieved for 42
of 75 hips by prolonging the orthosis fix-
ation time (mean 9 months), but 33 hips
required an operation, which included a
Salter pelvic osteotomy (20 hips) or a
Pemberton acetabular arthroplasty (13
hips). Prior to the final follow-up examin-
ation, the clinical results according to
McKay's hip function criteria were as fol-
lows: `excellent' in 169 hips, `good' in 103
hips, `fair' in 37 hips and `poor' in 30 hips.
The `excellent' and `good' rate was 80.24%
(272 of 339). Among the 67 hips rated as
`fair' and `poor', 9.73% (33 of 339 hips)
underwent an operation.
The final radiological examination was
performed at the final follow-up visit. The
X-rays were assessed according to the
Severin's classification and the findings
were as follows: 130 hips at type I, 136
hips at type II, 43 hips at type III, and 30
hips at type IV. Favourable radiological
results (types I and II) were observed in 266
of 339 hips (78.47%). According to the
Salter's criteria, 16 of 339 hips (4.72%), all
with Tonnis type 4 before reduction, were
complicated by AVN.
When the function of the hip (using
McKay's criteria) was analysed in patients
who were stratified according to their base-
line Tonnis type before the reduction was
undertaken, the `excellent' and `good' rate
for Tonnis types 1, 2, 3 and 4 were 84.31%,
80.65%, 77.78% and 79.07%, respectively;
and the four groups were not significantly
different (Table 2). All 16 hips complicated
276 Journal of International Medical Research 45(1)
by AVN had a Tonnis type 4 dislocation
before reduction and the dislocation height
was > 2 cm higher than the acetabular rim.
According to McKay's hip function criteria,
seven of 16 hips with AVN were rated as
`good', four hips were rated as `fair' and five
hips were rated as `poor'. For the nine hips
rated as `fair' or `poor', a Salter pelvic
osteotomy was later performed.
Before treatment, the AI values in all hips
were > 30. There was no significant differ-
ence between the rates of `excellent' and
`good' between the 30­35 and 36­40
groups, but when compared with the > 40
group, both groups demonstrated a signifi-
cant difference (P < 0.05 for both compari-
sons) (Table 3).
Discussion
After many years of clinical research, it is
now recognized that the starting treatment
age is one of the most important factors that
affects the long-term outcome of conserva-
tive treatment of DDH.9,10 As age and
dislocation time increases, a series of patho-
logical changes occur to the anatomical
structure of the hip joint in patients with
DDH, especially after the patients start to
walk.11 The grade of dislocation and the hip
joint surrounding the soft tissue contracture
often become more obvious.12,13 It has been
reported that it is difficult to achieve satis-
factory development of the acetabulum in
reductions undertaken after 18 months of
age.14 The developmental potential of an

acetabular shape can last until the patient is
10 years old.15 In China, as screening for
DDH is not widely undertaken, some
infants with DDH are not diagnosed prior
to them starting to walk.16 Their parents
usually seek medical advice at around 12
months of age following abnormal move-
ments, which leads to more infants with
DDH being diagnosed from 12 to 18 months
of age in China.16 Hip development ability
in infants under 18 months of age is rather
strong,12,15 so it is advisable to adopt a
minimally-invasive conservative treatment.
In this present study, dynamic casting for
the hip joint was applied for patients with
DDH aged 12­18 months at diagnosis with
satisfactory outcomes.
Our previous study of the acetabular
development of 400 normal infants (males
50%) at different ages found that their mean
AI at birth was 34.2; and prior to 6 months
of age, their mean AI was always > 30.17
When they were between 3 and 5 years old,
there was a developmental peak during
which the AI decreased rapidly; and by the
time they were between 7 and 8 years old, the
AI was close to the adult level.17 In all cases
in this present study, reduction was per-
formed to restore the anatomical position
before the development peak so that the
femoral head and acetabulum may interact
to promote the full use of the development
peak. The results of this present study
showed that for most 12- to 18-month-old
patients, after the orthosis had been fixed for
3 months, the femoral head and acetabulum
had achieved good development and were in
a satisfactory position. The mean follow-up
time was 9.5 years and 80.24% (272 of 339)
of hips achieved McKay's hip functional
criteria of `excellent' and `good'. These
current findings suggest that the dynamic
long leg casting method is a good technique
for treating patients with DDH who are
older than 12 months. The position fixation
used by us was the `frog' position with 90
abduction and 110 of flexion, through
which the femoral head can return to the
centre of the acetabulum. Meanwhile, due to
the existence of the femoral anteversion
angle, the femoral head contacts the upper
wall of the acetabulum, and after we imple-
mented external rotations for hip joints, the
femoral head contacts the upper and pos-
terior walls of the acetabulum. Therefore,
mechanical stimulation is conducive to the
development and growth of the upper and
posterior walls of the acetabulum.
It is generally recognized that the grade of
dislocation has an impact on the patho-
logical changes of the hip.18 However, there
are different opinions about the relationship
between the dislocation grade and the result
of conservative treatment. For example, a
study that analysed 100 patients with DDH
aged from 6 to 36 months who were treated
with a closed reduction method, reported
that the dislocation grade before reduction
impacted on the effect of treatment.19 This is
in direct contrast to the current findings,
which found no significant differences
between the rates of `excellent' and `good'
hip function based on McKay's criteria
between the four groups stratified according
to their baseline Tonnis type before the
reduction was undertaken (Table 2). These
current findings suggest that the radio-
graphic dislocation grade does not have a
direct relationship with the long-term thera-
peutic outcomes.
The AI is a common imaging index used
to evaluate the condition of a hip joint.
DDH is mainly manifested as AI increases.20
To date, there have been various inconsist-
ent reports regarding the influence of AI
before treatment on acetabulum develop-
ment post-reduction.21,22 During the follow-
up period in the present study, the AI before
the reduction was demonstrated to have an
impact on the outcomes. The higher the
baseline AI, the lower the rates of `excellent'
and `good' hip function based on McKay's
criteria. Therefore, patients with an AI > 40
should be treated by closed reduction with
278 Journal of International Medical Research 45(1)
caution. In this current group of 339 hips,
subluxation or joint space increases
occurred in 75 hips post-orthosis removal.
Even after prolonging the orthosis fixation
time, there were still 33 hips (9.73%) that
required an operation. Therefore, the closed
reduction method cannot be adopted for all
patients with DDH younger than 18 months
because it does not appear to be applicable
for those with an AI > 40.
In this present study, the dynamic long
leg casting method achieved good results.
According to Salter's criteria, the incidence
rate of AVN was 4.72%. In our opinion, this
relates to the following factors: (i) the use of
preoperative traction and adductor tenot-
omy in the current study was based on
previous research that found that compared
with patients receiving preoperative trac-
tion, the patients with Tonnis type 1 and 2
dislocations who did not receive traction
treatment had a more tensioned joint during
reduction and had a higher pressure between
the femoral head and acetabulum after
reduction.23 We speculate this is related to
contracture of the peripheral tissue and
capsular ligament of the hip joint.
Therefore, the present study implemented a
2-week traction treatment for all patients
before reduction. We routinely cut the
adductor and implemented skin traction or
bone traction of the lower limbs for 2 weeks.
With this method, the deformed muscle
groups can be effectively relaxed to improve
the blood circulation in blood vessels on the
inside of the circumflex femoral between the
iliopsoas muscle and the adductor muscle
and to reduce the pressure in the joint after
reduction; (ii) the implementation of closed
reduction under general anaesthesia to place
the contracted muscles into a relaxed state,
which was conducive to the repair and to
temporarilyeliminatethemechanicalpressure
between the femoral head and the acetabu-
lum; (iii) and based on the premise that the hip
joint can make an 80­110 flexion and
extension movement, we changed the static
point contact between the femoral head and
the acetabulum into a dynamic surface con-
tact, to make the stress between the acetabu-
lum and the femoral head closer to the
physiological state. At the same time, we
made the forces of the muscle groups around
the hip joint point to different directions along
the axial direction of the femoral shaft to
relieve the pressure between the acetabulum
and the femoral head to some extent.
In conclusion, the adductor tenotomy,
closed reduction, dynamic long leg casting
method is an effective method for treating
12- to 18-month-old patients with DDH.
The AI prior to reduction had an impact on
treatment outcome and could be used to
select patients most likely to benefit from the
closed reduction method because patients
with an AI < 40 had higher rates of treat-
ment success compared with patients with
an AI > 40. The extent of radiographic
dislocation before reduction had little effect
on the success rate of this closed reduction
treatment method.
