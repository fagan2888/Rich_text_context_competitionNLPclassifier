Introduction
Every year, about 500,000 women develop cervical cancer,
which is associated with certain types of human papilloma-
virus (HPV) and about 274,000 die from the disease glob-
ally (World Health Organization (WHO), 2007). Two HPV
prophylactic vaccines, Cervarix and Gardasil, have turned
out to be 90
percent effective in safely preventing HPV
types 16 and 18 infections, which together account for
about 70
percent of worldwide cervical cancer cases
(Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH),
2009). The HPV is primarily sexually transmitted
(Lenselink et al., 2008). The HPV vaccines are mostly tar-
geted on young adolescent girls and they are most effective
if given to HPV-unexposed girls. Research has captured
diverse fears about HPV vaccination of young adolescent
girls. Some of the fears are related to safety and unknown
side effects; the possibility of jeopardizing the future fertil-
ity of vaccinated girls; and the misunderstanding in some
environments that the vaccinations are meant to control fer-
tility or reduce the population of certain groups (Agosti and
Goldie, 2007; Katahoire et al., 2008; PATH, 2009; Remes
et al., 2012). Moreover, many children loathe injections
because they are painful, frightening, and psychologically
stressful (French et al., 1994). Fear of HPV vaccination is
known to be associated with significant distress among tar-
geted adolescents (Bernard et al., 2011). Previous research
on psychological distress in Ugandan adolescents mainly
focused on war-and HIV/AIDS-affected children (Atwine
et al., 2005; McMullen et al., 2012; Musisi and Kinyanda,
2009; Okello et al., 2007). The possibility of psychological
distress in adolescents facing potentially fear-provoking
HPV vaccinations has not been studied in Uganda. The
psychosocial paradigm of stress­distress relationship holds
that external stressors, if unchecked, do disrupt an individ-
ual's psychological equilibrium and induce physiological
and/or psychological responses in the form of distress

Abstract
Schoolgirls in two Ugandan districts were recently vaccinated against human papillomavirus that causes most cervical
cancer. This cross-sectional comparative study used mixed research methods to assess influence of human papillomavirus
vaccination on adolescents' worrisome thoughts about being vaccinated and psychological distress. Vaccination predicted
worrisome thoughts among the recently vaccinated (adjusted odds ratio: 1.65, confidence interval: 1.13­2.41; p=0.01).
Vaccination predicted distress (1.75, confidence interval: 1.09­2.82; p=0.02), particularly among those recently vaccinated
(1.92, confidence interval: 1.27­2.89; p
=
0.001) and those who experienced worrisome thoughts (1.80, confidence
interval: 1.06­3.07; p=0.02). Parental communication mitigated distress (0.50, confidence interval: 0.35­0.72; p=0.000).

Report of empirical study
2 Health Psychology Open 
(Ensel and Lin, 1991). In this study, we considered HPV
vaccinations and the associated worries to constitute stress-
ful events, which are threatening and undesirable rather
than life readjustment due to change per se (Vinokur and
Selzer, 1975). Research has demonstrated a consistency in
the relation between life stress (life events) and distress
(Ensel and Lin, 1991; Muhwezi et al., 2007). From 2008 to
2011, cohorts of adolescent girls from primary schools in
Ibanda and Nakasongola districts, Uganda were vaccinated
annually against HPV. The vaccination was part of a dem-
onstration project by the Uganda Government and PATH to
evaluate different HPV vaccine delivery strategies. A
school-based HPV vaccine delivery strategy was adopted
in Ibanda district targeting girls enrolled in primary grade 5
(P5). In Nakasongola district, the HPV vaccine was deliv-
ered during the routine Child Days Plus (CDP) program,
targeting girls of at least 10years. Each eligible girl was to
receive three doses of the vaccine administered in Month 1,
Month 2, and Month 6 (PATH et al., 2010). The purpose of
this study was to assess adolescent girls' psychological dis-
tress in Ibanda district, following HPV vaccination. Based
on the psychosocial paradigm of stress­distress relation-
ship, it was hypothesized in the research for this article that
girls vaccinated against HPV compared to unvaccinated
girls were more likely to have had worrisome thoughts
about vaccination and to experience high psychological
distress.
Methods
Design
This comparative, mixed methods cross-sectional study
was conducted between November and December 2011.
Girls vaccinated against HPV were drawn from Ibanda dis-
trict while unvaccinated participants for comparison were
selected from Mbarara district.
Participants
Primary school education in Uganda occurs over 7
years,
beginning with Primary 1 (P1) and ending with Primary 7
(P7). The participants in this study were girls enrolled in
Primary 5 (P5) and Primary 6 (P6). Vaccinated P6 study
participants had completed their vaccination 13
months
before, while their P5 colleagues completed vaccination
1
month prior to the date of data collection. During data
analysis, the latter were considered as recently vaccinated.
Using multi-stage sampling, 16 selected schools in Ibanda
district and the same number in Mbarara district were strat-
ified by rural­urban location. In Ibanda district, all assent-
ing P5 and P6 girls present on the day of the survey that had
received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine were
recruited. Similar criteria were followed for the unvacci-
nated comparison group in Mbarara district. A sample size
of 800 girls was determined for the survey using the for-
mula for sample size calculation to compare two propor-
tions in terms of risk (Pandey, 1999). Of the 800 girls
targeted, 777 (444 in Ibanda district and 333 in Mbarara
district) participated. There were 23 non-responders includ-
ing those who were absent from school and those who
did not return their parents' consent forms. Five focus
group discussions (FGDs) each with 8­12 vaccinated girls
in P5 or P6 were conducted one per school in Ibanda
district, involving five schools that had not been sampled
for the survey. FGD participants aged 13­16
years were
selected purposively with the help of teachers, targeting
self-confident and uninhibited girls who could talk freely in
a group. Girls who participated in FGDs had to have been
vaccinated against HPV so as to capture their observations
and experiences during vaccination.
Data collection
A survey questionnaire and FGDs were used to collect data.
Selected girls were assembled in a room on the day of the
survey. A pre-tested and translated self-administered ques-
tionnaire was used. Each girl filled the questionnaire under
close supervision of the first author (A.K.T.) and research
assistants who also explained to them the purpose and pro-
cedure of the survey. Data were collected first in Ibanda
district before Mbarara district. FGDs were conducted by
A.K.T. and a research assistant after survey data collection
in Ibanda district.
Measures
Independent variables were socio-demographic character-
istics (age, class attended, kind of school, location of
school, having parents, and perceived parental communica-
tion) and HPV vaccination status. Dependent variables
were worrisome thoughts about being vaccinated and level
of psychological distress. Moderator variable was knowl-
edge of HPV and HPV vaccine. Each variable was assessed
through responses to a set of questions or statements. The
variables were analyzed as dichotomous.
HPV vaccination status was assessed by asking respond-
ents whether they had ever been vaccinated against HPV.
Worrisome thoughts were assessed by asking respondents
whether they had ever felt very worried about having been
vaccinated or going to be vaccinated.
Psychological distress was assessed using the self-
administered Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire
(SDQ) for children aged 3­16years (Goodman, 1997). The
SDQ has 25 items, some positive and others negative. The
items are divided between five scales each with five items:
emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/
inattention, peer relationship problems, and prosocial
behavior. The first four scales are added together to gener-
ate a Total Difficulties Scale (TDS) based on 20 items with
Turiho et al. 3
scores ranging from 0 to 40. A cut-off score of 20 is usually
used to identify likely "cases" with non-specific mental
health disorders. In this study, TDS scores ranged from 1 to
30. In order to make our findings comparable with other
studies (Abbo et al., 2013; Kinyanda et al., 2013;
Moscardino et al., 2012) that used the SDQ to assess ado-
lescent psychological distress in the same country, Uganda,
we adopted a cut-off score of 16 to indicate adolescents'
high psychological distress. Scores 1­15 were banded to
denote low psychological distress, whereas scores 16­30
were banded to denote high psychological distress.
Knowledge was assessed through responses to 13
factual statements based on information from the print
materials used for community sensitization prior to HPV
vaccination. Perceived parental communication was
assessed by asking respondents how often their parents or
guardians talked to them about their future and the dangers
of pre-marital sex.
Data analysis
Quantitative data were analyzed for 769 girls. Data for
eight girls were excluded from the analysis when their
age (17­19
years) was found to be above 16
years, the
upper age limit for the version of SDQ used in this study.
Data were entered and cleaned using EpiData, and
then analyzed using SPSS v. 16.0 (SPSS Inc., 2007).
Univariate analysis was done to generate frequencies
and percentages for categorical variables. Means and
standard deviations (SDs) were generated for continuous
variables. The independent samples t-test was the statis-
tical test used to compare the continuous variables. Since
our sample was clustered by schools, we conducted com-
plex sample analyses by applying sampling weights to
the statistics (means, percentages, and odds ratios (ORs))
to take care of the effect of the sampling design. At
bivariate level, we evaluated relationships between inde-
pendent and dependent variables using the Pearson 2
test to determine statistical significance of observed dif-
ferences. We performed complex samples logistic regres-
sion to test the hypothesis that girls vaccinated against
HPV were more likely to report worrisome thoughts
about vaccination and high psychological distress. In the
analysis, we compared proportions of girls vaccinated
against HPV with proportions of unvaccinated girls.
Relevant ORs with corresponding confidence intervals
(CIs) set at 95percent were determined. Level of statistical
significance was set at 0.05.
Qualitative data were transcribed, word processed, and
entered into ATLAS.ti GmbH (1993) for coding and analy-
sis. Codes were developed based on the broad themes iden-
tified from the data. The codes were used to retrieve
segments of the data. Memos were written describing the
patterns and variations in the different segments of retrieved
data. Data matrices were drawn out of the retrieved data
sets according to the plan of analysis. Qualitative data were
used to interpret quantitative data.
Ethical issues and approval
The research was approved by the Higher Degrees Research
and Ethics Committee of the then Makerere University
Medical School and the Uganda National Council for
Science and Technology. Additional approvals were
obtained from relevant local government and school
authorities. Prior to the interviews, written assent and con-
sent were obtained from the targeted girls and their parents,
respectively.
Results
Socio-demographic characteristics of
respondents
The overall age range of girls was 9­16
years. The mean
age of vaccinated girls (13.4
years, SD
=
1.36) and unvac-
cinated girls (13.3
years, SD
=
1.32) was similar. Table 1
compares vaccinated and unvaccinated girls in terms of
socio-demographic characteristics. Vaccinated girls were
significantly more likely to perceive high parental commu-
nication (crude OR: 1.74, CI: 1.00­3.05; p=0.05).
Bivariate analysis
Worrying about vaccination.Table 2 shows respondents'
likelihood to report worrisome thoughts about being vac-
cinated according to their background characteristics.
Overall, fewer girls (270 out of 769 or 35%) responded
affirmatively; the majority (65%) reported no worrisome
thoughts about being vaccinated. Compared to unvacci-
nated girls, those vaccinated against HPV were more likely
to report worrisome thoughts about vaccination and the dif-
ference was almost significant (crude OR: 1.74, CI: 0.90­
3.23; p
=
0.10). Compared to P6 girls, P5 girls were
significantly more likely to report worrisome thoughts
about vaccination (crude OR: 1.61, CI: 1.12­2.32; p=0.01).
Psychological distress. Table 3 shows respondents'likelihood
to report high psychological distress according to their
background characteristics. Consistent with expectation,
more girls vaccinated against HPV (173 out of 440 or
39.3%) compared to unvaccinated girls (91 out of 329 or
27.7%) had high psychological distress and the difference
was statistically significant (crude OR: 1.70, CI: 1.04­2.77;
p=0.04). Compared to P6 girls, P5 girls were significantly
more likely to be highly distressed (crude OR: 2.05, CI:
1.31­3.21; p
=
0.003). Girls who perceived high parental
communication were significantly less likely to be dis-
tressed (crude OR: 0.52, CI: 0.37­0.70; p=0.001). Consist-
ent with expectation, a significant proportion of girls with
4 Health Psychology Open 
worrisome thoughts about vaccination (66 out of 270 or
24.8%) compared to girls without such thoughts (79 out of
499 or 15.2%) were highly distressed (crude OR: 2.01, CI:
1.18­3.45; p=0.01).
Logistic regression
Worrisome thoughts about vaccination and level of psychologi-
cal distress. Variables entered in the first model of logistic
regression to predict adolescents' worrisome thoughts
about vaccination were HPV vaccination status and class
attended. As shown in Table 4, HPV vaccination did not
predict worrisome thoughts about vaccination even after
controlling for class attended. The odds of a vaccinated girl
reporting worrisome thoughts increased but the difference
was not significant (p=0.09). Being in P5 predicted worri-
some thoughts about vaccination even after controlling for
HPV vaccination status (adjusted OR: 1.65, CI: 1.13­2.41;
p=0.01). Variables entered in the second model to predict
level of psychological distress were the significant back-
ground variables in bivariate analysis and worrisome
thoughts about being vaccinated. As shown in Table 4, vac-
cination against HPV (adjusted OR: 1.75, CI: 1.09­2.82;
p=0.02) and experiencing worrisome thoughts about vac-
cination (1.80, CI: 1.06­3.07; p=0.02) each predicted high
psychological distress even after adjusting for other varia-
bles in the model. High distress was more likely if the vac-
cinated girls were in P5 (1.92, CI: 1.27­2.89; p=0.001). On
the other hand, vaccinated girls were less likely to be psy-
chologically distressed if they perceived high parental com-
munication even after adjusting for other variables entered
in the model (0.50, CI: 0.35­0.72; p=0.000).
Discussion
Worrisome thoughts about vaccination
Contrary to our expectation, HPV vaccination was not a
strong predictor of adolescents' worrisome thoughts about
vaccination except among P5 girls (recently vaccinated).
Our qualitative results showed that the introduction of the
HPV vaccine had triggered several negative rumors that
were likely to worry the targeted adolescents. Apparently,
much of the reported worry especially concerning pain and
possible physical harm from injection was anticipatory,
which is a normal response to a perceived threat but an
unnecessary psychological trauma if no real threat exists
(Bernard et al., 2011). Qualitative findings indicated that
the fear of pain and possible physical harm from injection
was usually short-lived, suggesting that time was protec-
tive. Some girls were said to have missed the initial vaccine
dosages out of fear only to accept later after realizing that
those who had taken the vaccine had not been harmed. This
behavior toward the HPV vaccine has previously been
noted among both adolescents and their parents in other
studies (Katahoire et al., 2013; Watson-Jones et al., 2012).

This finding underscores a need for future HPV vaccination
programs to provide for second chance of dose 1 for girls
who initially avoid the vaccination out of fear but change
their minds later after learning from the experience of their
vaccinated colleagues that the vaccine is not harmful.
Psychological distress
As expected in this study, HPV vaccination predicted high
psychological distress. Comparable studies that assessed
adolescent psychological distress in Uganda using the SDQ
and a cut-off TDS score of 16 to indicate clinically signifi-
cant distress were conducted on adolescent samples drawn
from largely high-risk populations in war-affected northern
and north-eastern Uganda. Compared to the findings of
those studies, the 39.3
percent prevalence of clinically sig-
nificant distress among vaccinated adolescents in our study
is clearly higher than the 18.3percent among non-abducted
adolescents but lower than the 51.2
percent among war-
abducted adolescents in a war-affected district (Okello et al.,
2007); it is higher than the 23.1
percent among males and
29.7percent among females from two war-affected and two
non-war-affected districts (Abbo et al., 2013); and it is
greater than the 33.7percent among never abducted adoles-
cents but less than the 67.7percent among child soldiers in a
war-affected district (Moscardino et al., 2012). Our finding
showing relatively high prevalence of distress among vac-
cinated girls is inconsistent with previous studies of children
aged 7­11
years undergoing other vaccinations (cited in
Cohen et al., 1999). It was observed from those studies that
as children grow older they acquire more sophisticated and
logical thinking processes and are able to understand the
rationale for medical procedures. Consequently, they tend to
experience decreased worry, distress, and pain (Cohen et al.,
1999). However, our findings are largely in agreement with
findings of a qualitative study of adolescent girls' response
to HPV vaccination under a school-based vaccine delivery
arrangement (Bernard et al., 2011), which reported that fear
and distress were commonplace. The study cited negative
rumors or misinformation among the major factors behind

the girls'fear response. In our study, qualitative results show
various negative beliefs the vaccinated adolescents had
about HPV vaccination, which were largely based on rumors
and misinformation. Different FGD participants heard
rumors that those vaccinated could become barren or would
face a greater risk of life-threatening childbirth complica-
tions, HPV vaccination was a disguised plot to gradually kill
those vaccinated in unexplained ways, HPV vaccine causes
cervical cancer that would ultimately kill the vaccinated
person, and that those vaccinated would in future give birth
to only twins. Some of the vaccinated girls worried that it
would alter their menstrual cycles. The rumors, though not
backed by scientific evidence, are potential sources of dis-
tress if they are perceived as real. The positive association
between major stressors (such as negative life events) and
psychological distress has been previously confirmed
among adolescents in studies not related to HPV vaccina-
tion (Huang et al., 2009; McMullen et al., 2012; Qouta et al.,
2007) and among adults (Jackson and Finney, 2002; Mak
et al., 2005; Muhwezi et al., 2007; Tein et al., 2000). Life
events are especially distressing if they are viewed as unde-
sirable, uncontrollable, and unpredictable. Distress is pre-
dicted by the perception and the interpretation of events (as
negative) rather than by the occurrence of events themselves
(Jackson and Finney, 2002). In the context of HPV vaccina-
tion, it has been reported that being informed about and well
prepared for vaccination may reduce the propagation of
myths, rumors, and other fear-promoting factors (Bernard
et al., 2011). Future HPV vaccination programs should
include sensitization strategies to counteract the negative
rumors about the vaccinations so as to mitigate fear and
anxiety among targeted adolescents. In particular, future
sensitization programs need to explore the strategy of peer
involvement to mitigate targeted adolescents' fear and anxi-
ety. This suggestion is informed by this study's qualitative
findings showing that some vaccinated girls were mainly
encouraged by their friends to get vaccinated against the
HPV without fully understanding the vaccination, implying
that peer influence may have mitigated some of the fears
associated with the vaccination. Moreover, in the study by
Bernard and colleagues (Bernard et al., 2011), girls'concern
about their possible reactions in front of peers seemed to
amplify fear in some cases, yet having friends available in
the vaccination room to support them by holding arms or
talking to them had the reverse effect. Peer influence is a
known positive and negative factor in shaping adolescent
attitudes about HPV vaccine (Gamble et al., 2010; Katz
et al., 2013).
High psychological distress was especially likely if the
girls were recently vaccinated, consistent with findings of
another study that reported high levels of distress among
children during immunization in different settings (Cohen
et al., 1997). High distress was also likely if the vacci-
nated girls reported worrisome thoughts about being
vaccinated. This is in agreement with findings of the study
(Bernard et al., 2011), which concluded that fear of HPV
vaccination was a near universal experience among ado-
lescents undergoing HPV vaccination in a school setting
and was often associated with significant distress. Some
girls in our study's FGDs reported that while being pre-
pared for HPV vaccination, they felt anxious that it would
cause pain, bleeding, and irritation based on what they
heard from their friends at school. Many reported experi-
encing pain and swelling at the injection site, which ini-
tially caused worries of probable long-term physical
damage. These and other known adverse effects like diz-
ziness and headache have been reported in other studies
(Katahoire et al., 2013) but they are usually brief and non-
serious (WHO, 2012). Since this study's findings suggest
that both distress and worry especially about pain and
possible physical harm from injection were largely short-
term phenomena, there is a need for a psychosocial com-
ponent in future HPV vaccinations to identify and address
the affected adolescents' immediate psychosocial needs.
Health workers who administer the vaccines should be
trained in basic cognitive and behavioral interventions
that have been found to be effective in mitigating pain and
distress during immunizations such as child distraction,
encouraging the child to adopt the stress-reduction
behavior, imagery, preparation/information, modeling,
rehearsal, and desensitization (Bernard et al., 2011; Cohen
et al., 1997; French et al., 1994; Uman et al., 2008). Also,
future sensitization prior to HPV vaccinations should
clearly articulate the non-serious nature of the vaccine's
known adverse effects, their remedies, and their brevity so
as to minimize worry and possible distress among the tar-
geted adolescents.
Perceiving high parental communication mitigated ado-
lescent girls' distress associated with HPV vaccination.
This finding supports results of studies (Jackson et al.,
1998; Raveis et al., 1998), unrelated to HPV vaccination,
which show positive correlation between parent­adoles-
cent communication and adolescent psychological well-
being. Our finding is in agreement with the study of
adolescent girls undergoing HPV vaccination (Bernard
et al., 2011), where the responsible nurses reported that
parents who discussed HPV vaccination with their adoles-
cent girls helped to prepare them for the experience. It is
likely that in our study, the parents/guardians of vaccinated
adolescents who communicated highly with them included
HPV vaccination in their discussion with the adolescents
and prepared them for the vaccination, leading to parental
communication's mitigation of the adolescents' psycho-
logical distress. Future HPV vaccination programs should
invest adequately in sensitization of parents and encourag-
ing them to talk about vaccination with their adolescents
so as to make vaccination a positive experience for the
adolescents.

Study limitations
There was a possibility of recall bias among P6 girls who
were interviewed 1
year after vaccination. This was mini-
mized during assessment for psychological distress by ask-
ing respondents how things had been in the last 6
months.
One vaccination cohort (P6) was studied 1
year after com-
pletion of vaccination while the other (P5) was studied
1
month after vaccination. This was a limitation because
some of the psychological reactions to the vaccinations may
have subsided or cleared by the time of field data collection
for this study. Moreover, girls who may have developed
clinically significant psychological distress during vaccina-
tion were denied opportunity for early detection and treat-
ment. Future vaccination programs need to include
psychological distress assessment to further evaluate time
pattern of clinically significant distress and to enable the
affected girls to get timely therapeutic intervention. The age
design of the study whereby the same age cohort was simul-
taneously studied poses a limitation, whereby cause­effect
relationships between variables could not be evaluated.
Longer term follow-up studies involving more than one age
cohort will be needed in future to be able to assess adoles-
cents' long-term psychological reactions to HPV vaccina-
tions. A major limitation of the study was the assessment of
worrisome thoughts by asking respondents whether they had
ever felt very worried about having been vaccinated or going
to be vaccinated without delving into aspects such as content
and degree of worry. All respondents who responded affirm-
atively to the question were treated as homogenous during
data analysis, which may not be true in reality. This limited
the ability of the study to make recommendations for focused
clinical interventions to deal with adolescents' anxiety asso-
ciated with the vaccination. Furthermore, by not specifying
worry content, the study left a possibility that the worry
reported by respondents could have been induced by some of
the topics covered in the study questionnaire such as cervical
cancer and dangers of pre-marital sex and the future, which
may be independently related to worry about HPV vaccina-
tion. Future studies should adopt standard instruments for
assessment of worrisome thoughts whose findings would
provide firm basis for recommendation of clinical interven-
tions to deal with the affected adolescents'anxiety. Selection
of FGD participants with the help of their teachers targeting
girls sharing certain characteristics may have biased the
qualitative results since those girls could have shared atti-
tudes associated with shared characteristics. The effect of
this was minimized by organizing FGDs in five different
schools. The main strength of this study is its relatively large
sample size that increased the power of the study tests.
Conclusion
We set out to assess the influence of HPV vaccination on
adolescents' experience of worrisome thoughts about
vaccination and levels of psychological distress. HPV
vaccination predicted experience of worrisome thoughts
only among recently vaccinated adolescents. Several HPV
vaccination-related fears were reported qualitatively among
vaccinated girls. HPV vaccination predicted high psycho-
logical distress, more so if the adolescents had completed
their vaccination doses recently, and had experienced wor-
risome thoughts about being vaccinated. Perceiving high
parental communication mitigated psychological distress
among adolescent girls vaccinated against HPV. This study
makes several recommendations for future HPV vaccina-
tion program design and research based on findings, related
literature, and study limitations.
