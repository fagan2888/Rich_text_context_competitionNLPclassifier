Objective: To determine whether state policies that regu-
late beverages in schools are associated with reduced in-
school access and purchase of sugar-sweetened bever-
ages (SSBs) and reduced consumption of SSBs (in and
out of school) among adolescents.
Design: Cross-sectional.
Setting: Public schools in 40 states.
Participants: Students sampled in fifth and eighth grades
(spring 2004 and 2007, respectively).
Main Exposures: State policies that ban all SSBs and
state policies that ban only soda for 2006-2007.
Main Outcome Measures: In-school SSB access, in-
school SSB purchasing behavior, and overall SSB con-
sumption (in and out of school) in eighth grade.
Results: The proportions of eighth-grade students who
reported in-school SSB access and purchasing were simi-
lar in states that banned only soda (66.6% and 28.9%,
respectively) compared with states with no beverage policy
(66.6% and 26.0%, respectively). In states that banned
all SSBs, fewer students reported in-school SSB access
(prevalence difference, -14.9; 95% CI, -23.6 to -6.1) or
purchasing (-7.3; -11.0 to -3.5), adjusted for race/
ethnicity, poverty status, locale, state obesity preva-
lence, and state clustering. Results were similar among
students who reported access or purchasing SSBs in fifth
grade compared with those who did not. Overall SSB con-
sumption was not associated with state policy; in each
policy category, approximately 85% of students re-
ported consuming SSBs at least once in the past 7 days.
Supplementary analyses indicated that overall consump-
tion had only a modest association with in-school SSB
access.
Conclusion: State policies that ban all SSBs in middle
schools appear to reduce in-school access and purchas-
ing of SSBs but do not reduce overall consumption.

IN THE PAST 25 YEARS, SOURCES OF
energy intake among youth have
shifted toward greater consump-
tion of sugar-sweetened bever-
ages (SSBs), such as soda, sports
drinks, and high-calorie fruit drinks.1-4 This
shift has important public health implica-
tions given that SSB consumption has been
associated with youth obesity and weight
gain,5-7 whichhaveseveralphysicalandpsy-
chosocialconsequences.8,9 Consumptionof
SSBs encourages weight gain because indi-
viduals do not compensate for consump-
tion of liquid carbohydrates by reducing

consumption can pose health risks by dis-
placing milk consumption,13,14 thereby re-
ducing calcium intake, and increasing the
risk of dental caries.15-17
Surveillance studies have demon-
strated that SSBs are widely available in
schools nationwide.18-21 Foods and bever-
ages sold outside of federal school meal
programs are not required to meet fed-
eral nutrition standards, and this led the
American Academy of Pediatrics,22 US De-
partment of Agriculture,23 American Di-
etetic Association,24 and policy-making or-
ganizations25,26 to call for federal, state, and
local policies to improve the nutritional
content of school foods and beverages. The
Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthoriza-
tion Act of 2004 required local education
agencies that sponsor school meal and
other child nutrition programs to estab-
lish nutrition guidelines for foods and bev-
erages sold outside of school meal pro-
grams.27 More recently, the Healthy,

Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 requires the US Depart-
ment of Agriculture to develop regulations governing com-
petitive foods and beverages sold in schools.28 Many states
have also passed laws to regulate competitive foods,29-31
and the American Beverage Association, American Heart
Association, and Clinton Foundation collaborated to es-
tablish School Beverage Guidelines to improve the nu-
tritional content of school beverages by the start of the
2009-2010 school year.32
The Institute of Medicine recommended that all SSBs
be banned in schools,33 but many state competitive food
policies have focused primarily on soda while allowing
sports drinks, fruit drinks, and other SSBs.31,34 Sodas are
the primary type of SSB consumed by adolescents; soda
accounted for more calories than any other food or bev-
erage group among 14- to 18-year-olds in 2005-2006.35
Other SSBs represent a growing health concern, how-
ever. The American Academy of Pediatrics recently pub-
lished a statement discouraging youth consumption of
energy and sports drinks, for example,36 because many
youth perceive them to be a healthy alternative to soda37
despite the high levels of added sugar.
Research has suggested that when policies restrict only
certain foods or beverages, schools and students will com-
pensate by obtaining different low-nutrient foods and bev-
erages. A study in Washington State found that, in the
second year of the wellness policy requirement (2007-
2008), only 17% of schools were selling soda on cam-
pus, but 72% were selling other SSBs.38 After California
established nutrition standards for competitive foods,
availability of soda in schools decreased substantially, but
availability of sports drinks increased slightly.39 In Texas,
a statewide Public School Nutrition Policy appeared to
cause students to obtain different high-calorie foods from
different sources (eg, home).40 Although each study re-
ported reduced SSB exposure or improvements in di-
etary consumption, researchers concluded that policies
must provide healthy alternatives in all settings in order
to be effective.39,40
As described earlier, not all state policies targeting
school beverages have been comprehensive because many
allowed SSBs other than soda. To our knowledge, no study
has examined whether states that restrict only soda are
as effective in reducing SSB availability and consump-
tion compared with states with more comprehensive poli-
cies. The objective of this study was to estimate the as-
sociation between different types of state beverage policies
and in-school SSB access and purchasing and overall SSB
consumption (in and out of school).
METHODS
MEASURES
Policy Data
State policies governing the sale of soda and other SSBs in middle
schools in 2006-2007 were compiled as part of the Bridging the
Gap research program.41 For purposes of this study, state "policy"
was defined to include codified state statutory and administra-
tive (ie, regulatory) laws effective as of September 2006. Poli-
cies were obtained through keyword searches and reviews of
the tables of contents and indices of state laws available by sub-
scription to the Westlaw and Lexis-Nexis legal research data-
bases. Policies were double-coded by 2 trained coders and veri-
fied against secondary source state law data to ensure complete
collection and coding interpretation.34,42-45
States were classified as having (1) a policy limiting the avail-
ability of soda and other SSBs (eg, "Only milk, water, and 100%
juice will be available in school"), (2) a policy prohibiting soda
but no policy limiting the availability of other SSBs (eg, "Al-
lowed beverages include milk, water, energy drinks, and elec-
trolyte replacement beverages"), or (3) no policy limiting any
type of SSB.
Student Data
Student data were obtained from the Early Childhood Longi-
tudinal Study­Kindergarten Class. This cohort began as a na-
tionally representative sample of kindergarten students in fall
1998 and was followed up over time, through 7 rounds of data
collection. The analyses in this study were based on data from
round 6 (fifth grade, spring 2004) and round 7 (eighth grade,
spring 2007). The policy data were merged to the individual-
level Early Childhood Longitudinal Study­Kindergarten Class
data on the basis of state-level geocode identifiers obtained un-
der special agreement. This study was approved by the insti-
tutional review board of the University of Illinois at Chicago.
The dependent variables of interest were in-school SSB ac-
cess, in-school SSB purchasing, and overall SSB consumption
(which included in- and out-of-school consumption). Each vari-
able was measured using a questionnaire administered at school.
Access was measured by asking students, "In your school, can
kids buy soda pop, sports drinks, or fruit drinks that are not
100% fruit juice in the school?" Purchasing was measured by
asking, "During the last week that you were in school, how many
times did you buy soda pop, sports drinks, or fruit drinks at
school?" Overall consumption was measured by asking, "Dur-
ing the past 7 days, how many times did you drink soda pop,
sports drinks, or fruit drinks that are not 100% fruit juice?" Stu-
dents were instructed to consider all settings (school, home,
etc) when reporting consumption. For purchasing and con-
sumption, there were 7 response categories ranging from "I did
not purchase/drink any" to "4 or more times per day." Catego-
ries were collapsed to create dichotomous measures of weekly
purchasing/consumption (ie, 1 in the past 7 days) and daily
purchasing/consumption (ie, 1 per day).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Among the 9170 public school students who were measured
in fifth grade, 2270 were excluded from the analyses because
they enrolled in a private school (n=130), moved to another
state (n=150), were missing data on school type (n=230), or
were lost to follow-up (n=1760), leaving a final sample of 6900.
Among those excluded, the prevalence of in-school SSB pur-
chasing and weekly SSB consumption in fifth grade was simi-
lar compared with the study sample. Those excluded were less
likely to report in-school SSB access (P.001) and more likely
to report daily SSB consumption (P=.04) in fifth grade. Those
excluded were also less likely to be non-Hispanic white
(P.001) and more likely to live in an urban area (P.001)
or be below the poverty line (P.001).
General linear models, with an identity link, were used to
estimate differences between state policy categories in the prob-
ability of eighth-grade students reporting the following: (1) in-
school SSB access, (2) weekly in-school SSB purchase, (3) daily
in-school SSB purchase, (4) weekly overall SSB consumption
(in and out of school), and (5) daily overall SSB consumption.

Eighth-grade measures were modeled because the state poli-
cies that were used applied to the 2006-2007 school year and
were linked to eighth-grade data collected in spring 2007. In-
dicator variables were used to adjust for student race/ethnicity
(non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or non-
Hispanic other), poverty status (whether annual household in-
come was above the federal poverty level), and school locale
(urban, suburban, township, or rural). Models also adjusted
for state obesity prevalence (continuous), using data from the
2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System,46 and used a
robust variance estimate to adjust for within-state correla-
tion.47 All analyses were conducted with Stata, version 11 (Stata-
Corp, College Station, Texas).48
In addition to modeling eighth-grade outcomes in the overall
sample,weinvestigatedwhetherstatepolicieswereassociatedwith
within-student changes in SSB access, purchasing, and consump-
tionfromfifthtoeighthgradebyrepeatingthemodelsin2panels--
students who did not report the outcome in question (eg, ac-
cess) in fifth grade and those who did. Comparing results across
panels enabled us to explore whether state policies may be more
effective at primary prevention (eg, preventing adolescents from
starting to consume SSBs over time) or secondary prevention (eg,
encouraging them to cease consumption), although the tempo-
ral sequence of measures precludes us from concluding that poli-
cies were the cause of any changes.
The policies that we examined were designed to reduce
SSB access at schools, on the rationale that reducing within-
school access will reduce overall consumption. To test this
rationale, a supplementary analysis was conducted in which
we estimated the association between within-student
changes in SSB access at school and overall SSB consump-
tion, using a fixed-effect model to adjust for unmeasured,
time-invariant characteristics.
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics of the study sample are presented
by state policy category in Table 1. States that banned
all SSBs and states that had no beverage policies gener-
ally had similar sociodemographic characteristics, but
states that banned only soda had different distributions
of race/ethnicity, locale, and poverty status. In particu-
lar, states that banned soda had higher proportions of His-
panic students (33.0%), students below the poverty line
(22.3%), and students in urban areas (48.7%), and lower
proportions of white, non-Hispanic students (44.8%) and
students in township or rural areas (4.2% and 10.1%,
respectively).
The Figure displays in-school SSB access, in-school
SSB purchasing, and overall SSB consumption (in and out
of school) in fifth and eighth grades, by state policy cat-
egory. There were obvious differences between policy cat-
egories in patterns of SSB access and weekly purchase over
time. States with no school beverage policy in 2006-
2007 had, 3 years earlier, relatively low proportions of
fifth-grade students who reported in-school SSB access
and weekly purchase (34.7% and 9.7%, respectively). By
2007, however, the prevalence of SSB access and weekly
purchase in these states had escalated to 66.6% and 26.0%,
respectively. States that governed all SSBs in 2006-
2007, in contrast, began with higher proportions of stu-
dents who reported access and weekly purchase in fifth
grade (48.9% and 19.0%, respectively) but experienced
only a marginal increase over time (4.5% and 1.4%,
respectively). Overall SSB consumption (in and out of
school) was similar across grades and policy categories.
Most students (83%-87%) reported weekly consump-
tion, and 26% to 33% reported daily consumption, re-
gardless of grade or state policy.
Table 2 presents the differences between policy cat-
egories in the adjusted prevalence of in-school SSB ac-
cess and purchasing. Results are presented for each of
the 3 panels--all students combined, those who re-
ported the outcome in question in fifth grade, and those
who did not. Across all models, SSB access and weekly
purchase were equally prevalent in states that regulated
only soda vs states with no beverage regulations. In states
that regulated all SSBs, fewer students reported SSB ac-
cess at school (prevalence difference, -14.9; 95% CI, -23.6
to -6.1) or weekly purchase of SSBs at school (-7.3; -11.0
to -3.5). The results were similar in all panels, although
the effect size was stronger in students who reported ac-
cess or purchase in fifth grade. There was no difference
across policy categories in the proportion of students who
reported daily SSB purchase (this outcome was not mod-
eled in the right column because only 2.8% of students
reported daily purchase in fifth grade).
In contrast to the results in Table 2, there were gen-
erally no differences between policy categories in over-
all (in and out of school) SSB consumption (Table 3).
Daily SSB consumption was actually more prevalent in
states that regulated SSBs in school (prevalence differ-
ence,5.8; 95% CI, 0.6 to 11.1), particularly among stu-
dents who did not report daily consumption in fifth grade
(7.7; 1.2 to 14.3).

The contrast between Tables 2 and 3 was reflected in
the supplementary analysis in which we estimated the
association between within-student changes in SSB ac-
cess at school and overall SSB consumption. Results from
the fixed-effect model (not shown) revealed that this as-
sociation was, at best, statistically significant but small
in magnitude. Changes in students' SSB access at school
were associated with 1.9% fewer students reporting weekly
consumption (=-0.02; 95% CI, -0.03 to -0.01), whereas
the association with daily consumption was in the op-
posite direction (0.02; 0.00 to 0.04). In short, the preva-
lence of infrequent SSB consumption decreased slightly,
whereas the prevalence of frequent SSB consumption in-
creased slightly, when students' access to SSB at schools
was eliminated.
To summarize, state policies regulating beverages sold
in middle schools were associated with reduced in-
school SSB access and purchasing only if they banned all
SSBs. Access and purchasing were equivalent in states that
banned only soda compared with those with no policy
at all. However, even comprehensive SSB policies were
not associated with overall consumption of SSBs, which
was largely independent of students' in-school SSB
access.
COMMENT
States and school districts nationwide have taken aggres-
sive action to change the school food environment by pro-
viding foods and beverages of higher nutritional
value.29-31,49 Our study adds to a growing body of litera-
ture that suggests that to be effective, school-based policy
interventions must be comprehensive. States that only
ban soda, while allowing other beverages with added ca-
loric sweeteners, appear to be no more successful at re-
ducing adolescents' SSB access and purchasing within
school than states that take no action at all. As students

in this study progressed from fifth to eighth grade, their
levels of SSB access and purchasing increased in states
that ban soda as much as in states that have no SSB policy.
States with more comprehensive laws banning all SSBs
experienced only a slight increase in access and purchas-
ing across grades.
The inability of soda-only bans to limit SSB access and
purchasing raises questions about how schools comply
with state policies. Woodward-Lopez et al39(p2142) re-
ported that California legislation designed to improve the
nutritional content of competitive foods and beverages
had a positive effect on school food environments over-
all, but "many compliant foods were merely modified ver-
sions of highly processed foods that were previously non-
compliant (eg, baked chips)." If schools adapt to state
policies that ban soda by increasing the availability of
sports drinks, fruit drinks, and other SSBs, the public
health impact of these policies may be minimal. Even
100% fruit juice has caloric content similar to that of SSBs,
and policies are unlikely to prevent excess weight gain
if students replace SSBs with equal amounts of 100% fruit
juice. If beverage policies are to improve student health,
schools could do this by promoting unflavored water and
limited servings of 100% fruit juice and low-fat milk, as
recommended by the Institute of Medicine.33
The state policies that we examined were designed to
change the school food environment to limit students'
access to SSBs while at school. Obviously, the rationale
was that limiting students' access to SSBs within school
should reduce their overall consumption because they
spend a large portion of their day in school during the
school year. We found no evidence that state SSB poli-
cies were associated with lower overall consumption, how-
ever, and our supplementary analyses revealed that
changes in students' in-school SSB access reduced infre-
quent consumption (at least weekly) but slightly in-
creased frequent consumption (at least daily), suggest-
ing that heavier consumers compensated to a greater
extent with increased consumption outside of school.
Other studies similarly reported that schools were a rela-
tively minor source of SSBs for adolescents3 and that the
association between in-school SSB availability and SSB
consumption was modest.38,50,51 In the contemporary "obe-
sogenic" environment, youth have countless ways to ob-
tain SSBs through convenience stores, fast-food restau-
rants, and other food outlets in their community.
These patterns have led some experts to question
whether school-based policies will improve youth diet and
reduce obesity.3,52,53 The development of time-series state-
level policy databases will help to provide evidence on the
extent to which such policies can reduce or prevent fur-
ther increases in overall consumption. Nonetheless, our re-
sults based on a single cross section indicate that state poli-
ciesproducepositivechangesinschoolfoodenvironments,
butanyeffectonstudentdietaryconsumptionmaybemod-
est without complementary changes in other sectors, in-
cluding the food environment in the community, as well
as at-home consumption.3,50,51,54 Experts have recom-
mended broader policies, such as SSB taxes55 or regula-
tions of food marketing aimed at children.56 Future re-
search should explore the effect that school-based policies
have on youth diet and weight gain when implemented in
conjunction with policies in other sectors.
One of the strengths of this study was the ability to
measure within-student changes in SSB access, purchas-
ing, and consumption between fifth and eighth grade. Be-
cause the policies were compiled when the students were
in eighth grade, though, it is impossible to conclude that
policies preceded any changes in access or purchasing.
Furthermore, students who were not followed up over
time differed from the study sample in terms of socio-
economic characteristics, in-school SSB access, and over-
all SSB consumption, which may have biased results if
students of low socioeconomic status benefit more or less
from policies. The associations, or lack thereof, could also
be biased by unmeasured confounding or measurement
error, because youth commonly misreport their dietary
intake.57 Finally, the student questionnaires did not sepa-
rate different types of SSBs. This precluded us from ex-
amining whether the lack of association between soda-
only policies and SSB access or purchasing is due to
schools providing different types of SSBs or simply not
complying with state policies.
In conclusion, comprehensive state policies that limit
all SSBs within school appear effective in producing posi-
tive changes in school food environments. School is only
