Introduction
When two different religious systems exist in one community,
the tendencies of conflicts of socioreligious, ideological, phys-
ical, and even political characters will arise between them.
Jesus Christ, the founder of Christianity was constantly
opposed by the religious leaders of the Jews. The Jews had no
room for compromise with any new ideology, which tended to
deviate from the Law of Moses or the traditions of the elders.
The conflicts continued from the beginning of Jesus ministry
until it reached a climax and ultimately led to the crucifixion
of Jesus. Immediately after his death, his disciples started to
speak against the attitude of the Jews toward the new religion
and Stephen was stoned to death. In the ancient Roman
Empire, this also happened between Christianity and pagan
religion of the Romans. The Igbo society is not an exception.
The wanton destruction of lives and property triggered by
these conflicts has resulted in the topic under review. The aim
of the study is to investigate the conflicts existing between the
two religions since the introduction of Christianity in Igbo
land, the nature, the pattern, and the rationale of the conflicts.
The historical origin of the Igbo is not yet certain because
of the different views by historians and archeologists. Isichei
(1976) observes that
the first human inhabitants of Igbo land must have come from
areas further north, possibly from the Niger confluence. But
men have been living in Igbo nation for at least 5,000 years since
the dawn of human history. One of the most notable facts of the
Igbo history is its length and continuity. (p. 3)
She notes further that "Igbo began to diverge from other
related languages, such as Edo and Yoruba 4,600 years ago"
(Isichei, 1976, p. 3).
The Igbo language of course is the language spoken in
Nigeria by people who are located predominantly in the south-
eastern part of Nigeria. The southeastern part of Nigeria con-
sists of five states that are known as the core Igbo-speaking
states. They are Imo, Enugu, Ebonyi,Anambra, and Abia. Igbo
people can be seen in some parts of other states. The states are
Delta, Rivers, Bayelsa, andAkwa Ibom.According to the 2006
Census of Nigeria, the Igbo population is estimated to be

Conflicts Between African Traditional
Religion and Christianity in Eastern
Nigeria: The Igbo Example
Chukwuma O. Okeke1, Christopher N. Ibenwa1,
and Gloria Tochukwu Okeke1
Abstract
Conflict is a universal phenomenon that is inevitable in human interaction. Hence, it cannot be avoided in the interaction
between Christianity and African Traditional Religion. Since Christianity came in contact with the traditional religion, there
has always been a sharp conflict between traditionalists and Christians. This bitter conflict has led to wanton destruction of
lives and property, and this has become a source of great worry to the writers. This work investigates the conflicts existing
between the two religions since the introduction of Christianity in Igbo land. It examines the nature, pattern, rationale for the
conflicts. The method adopted by this study is qualitative and comparative. Both oral interviews and library materials were
used. The study validates the following: There is occasional destruction of lives and property and demolition of the people's
artifacts and groves by Christians, and this has led to reduction in the sources of income of the people, and in the tourist sites
available in most Igbo towns. It also led to syncretism in the people's culture. Finally, it helped in refining some obnoxious
beliefs and practices of the Igbo race.

around 21 million, whereas the land area is about 15,800 square
miles. They occupy the area between 5.8° north and 6.8° east.
Linguistically, they belong to the new Benue­Congo of
the Niger­Congo Language family. Their occupations
include trading, farming, craft making among others. In the
Igbo language, there are so many dialects, which are mutu-
ally intelligible. Nwozuzu (2008) groups the Igbo dialect
into eight major dialect groups:
 (i) West Niger group of dialects
 (ii) East Niger group of dialects
 (iii) East Central group of dialects
 (iv) Cross River group of dialects
 (v) Southeastern group of dialects
 (vi) Northeastern group of dialects
(vii) Southwestern group of dialects
(viii) Northern group of dialects.
Igbo Religion
Igbo religion is traditional according to Mbiti (1970), in the
sense that it is rooted in their culture. It is received by oral
authority by one generation and transmitted by the same pro-
cess to subsequent generations and, thus, has effect of being
widely diffused among its adherents and of deeply coloring
their consciousness. It exhibits for this very traditional pecu-
liarity highly ontological phenomena, pertaining to the ques-
tion of existence and being. Furthermore, within the
traditional life, the individual is immersed in a religious par-
ticipation, which starts before birth and continues after death,
for the life of an Igbo man is like a religious drama, which
vitally links the living with the ancestors and those yet to be
born in a mystic continuum.
Ugwu (2014) says that the Igbo who belong of course to
the West African subregion,
. . . are a truly religious people of whom it can be said as it has
been said about the Hindus that they eat religiously, dress
religiously, sin religiously . . . religion of these natives is their
existence and existence is their religion.
Religion in Igbo traditional society partakes fully of all
the features of world traditional religion, including its beliefs,
sacred myths, oral qualities, strong appeal to the hearts of
adherents, high degree of ritualization, and possession of
numerous participatory personages such as officiating elders,
kings, priests, and diviners. Everyone is in fact a religious
carrier. There are no missionary elders to propagate the reli-
gion, and one individual does not preach his religion to
another as is the case with nontraditional proselytizing reli-
gions. The objects of Igbo religion and worship in the strict
sense according to Ejizu (2010) in http://www.culturalnorm-
sofIgbos.religion.acare threefold: God, nonhuman spirits,
and the ancestors. The Igbo believe in the Supreme Being,
who is the controller of the world and all that are in the world.
Their firm belief in the Supreme Being is manifest in the
names they give their children as Chukwuemeka (God has
done much), Chukwuka (God is greater), Chukwuma (God
knows), and so forth. It is worthy of note to observe that the
High God is not represented in any carved or molded form, is
not assigned a shrine. He is said to have his abode above the
sky (see Phil-Eze, 2009, and http://www.culturalnormsofIg-
bos.religion.ac).
In more generalized sense, this deity is believed to be
ubiquitous and invisible. He is looked upon as the fountain of
justice. The Igbo, apart from their belief in the great God
conceived as transcendental and incomprehensible, also
believe in a pantheon of lesser deities, such as Ala (earth
goddess), Ufiejik (god of agriculture), Idemili (god of
water), Agw (god of medicine, divination, and possession),
and so forth. The activities of these lesser deities are closely
associated and interwoven with the daily life of the Igbo
people. These deities, they believe, protect them, control
their behavior and worldview. Conversely, human beings
have some influences over these deities. In addition to the
above-mentioned gods are some personalized gods such as
Chi and the Ikenga. The Igbo believe also in the cult of the
ancestors. Every Igbo man has his own personal image or
figure of Chi and the Ikenga (Isichei, 1976), and everyone
reveres the ancestral spirits (referred to as Nd nna any
["Our fathers"]). The personal god, chi, is what they call the
guardian deity deputizing for Chukwu. Arinze (1974), in the
same vein sees this concept of Chi as a genius or spiritual
double. The essential role of Chi concept is seen in the Igbo
proverb, which says Onye kwe, chi ya ekwe (when one says
yes, his personal god says yes). This assertion of the Igbo
proverb is also emphasized by Madam Nwaku Anwaegbu
(oral interview, 2013; see the appendix for the list of inter-
viewees and the dates interviewed), who says that Chi is a
force in Igbo social behavior, which is characterized by an
attitude of man; every being is the architect of his own for-
tune. In spite of the fact that the Igbo believe that the indi-
vidual is the maker of his own fortune, they also believe in
predestination, for they also agree that one's Chi refers to
one's luck, which is associated with his destiny. In other
words, what the person is going to be has already been preor-
dained before he came into the world. This destiny can be
written on his palm and palmists can interpret this destiny
(Ikenga-Metuh, 1972). Again, akara aka j, that is, "hard
luck," is a common explanation for one's ill-luck in this
world.
In addition, Igbo religion makes use of Ikenga. Ikenga is
usually owned by every adult male who has attained man-
hood. Chief Obiora, Stephen (oral interview, 2013) notes that
the possession of Ikenga comes at a time when the individual
has obtained a measure of independence from his father and
is able to build his own family. This Ikenga has to be cele-
brated, vitalized, and consecrated before it becomes effec-
tive. In some parts of Igbo, for instance, in Nkpor in
Idemili-North Local Government Area (LGA) of Anambra
Okeke et al. 3
state, the Ikenga is spilt during the funeral celebrations of the
owner. Commenting generally on the traditional customs of
Onitsha people, Onyeidu (2001) says,
. . . as could be expected, associated with the indigenous religious
beliefs and practices of the people of Onitsha were time
honoured customs handed down from their ancestors. Some of
these customs include: the cleansing of the town of pollution and
desecration, the institution of slavery, human sacrifice, killing of
twins, taking of oath and trial by ordeal, first and second burial
for the dead, long mourning period for widows, and of course
the practice of polygamy. (Onyeidu, 2001, p. 6)
Ancestor worship. The Igbo society believes in character and
has very strong belief in life after death. Mbiti (1970) posits
that when a person dies, his soul or spirit wanders around the
bush, until his relations perform the necessary and befitting
burial rites. The waiting stage before the incorporation of the
deceased into the world of the dead is called transitional
period of the deceased. The ancestors, the Igbo believe,
wield tremendous powers of blessings and power of curse.
After the interment of a fulfilled elder, and after the obse-
quies must have been completed, the family usually the
kpala (the first male child in the family), erects a shrine and
creates an okposi (f like sticks) for venerating the spirit of
the dead through prayers and sacrifices. The Igbo, according
to Ilogu (1974), believe that sometimes the dead ancestor
may reincarnate into their agnatic families. They believe that
the dead ancestors do not come back in their original forms;
rather, they become especially interested in the newborn
child, who they say may inherit some of the ancestors' char-
acteristics. The ancestor becomes the tutelary spirit of the
child and sees to the well-being of the child. The Igbo regard
these ancestors as the special guardians of morality and cre-
ate shrines in their honor, as well as creating symbolic refer-
ences to their existence.
f.The Igbo believe so much in the concept of f. An
Igbo man uses the f as a symbol of justice, righteousness,
and truth. Not only that, f to him symbolizes fair play,
innocence, trust, good luck, peace, equity, sacredness, good
moral conduct, good leadership, accountability, and honesty.
Parrinder (1975) avers that f performs three functions in
Igbo land, that is, social, political, and religious but the polit-
ical and religious functions are most important in that no
serious rite or ceremony is performed without making use of
f. What the Bible is to the Christians, f is also to the
traditional Igbo people. The poor and the widow take conso-
lation in f, especially in land cases, for without the fear of
the f, they will be maltreated by the rich and powerful and
from the name such as fbuike (f is strength), you see
that the Igbo regard of very highly. f has various types,
namely, f ala (f for mother Earth), f mnna (f for
the kinsmen), f z (f for titled men), f dibia (f for
diviners), and so forth.
Ogu.In most parts of Igbo land, ogu is closely connected
with f. It is also a measure of justice and fair play. Many
Igbo clans always use f and ogu together, for example, "eji
m f na ogu--I have f (justice) and ogu (innocence)."
Ogu is more of a concept than of a physical object. It symbol-
izes innocence (Uwalaka, 1996). Ogu also serves as a peace-
ful gadget. In Igbo land, if one is quarreling with somebody,
one can give the stalk of ogirisi leaf (uboldia; a sacred plant
that is used as ogu) to an elder relation of that person and
warn him or her to keep away from him or her or to show that
he or she does not want his or her association. In most Igbo
societies, you do not take action against someone who
offends you without first of all sending him ogu at least three
times. This is called (manye ogu), that is, sending him a note
of warning through his relation or a close friend. Ogu creates
an atmosphere for peaceful settlement. The ordinary ogu and
f have psychological effect and work on the conscience of
every Igbo man and woman.
Ala. Igbo people hold most sacred, the Earth (Ala) on which
they tread and from which they draw means of sustenance
and vital resources such as food, crops, water, and so forth.
Ala, according to Iwe (1985), is the sustainer of all lives and
fertility. It is on land that we build our houses. It is also to this
land that the dead go when they die and are buried. Ala is so
sacred that anyone who commits an abomination against it
does not hope to survive. This explains why ns ala (abomi-
nation against Ala) is dreaded because it has severe repercus-
sions. A typical example is found in Achebe's (1958) Things
Fall Apart, where Okonkwo, the protagonist, had to flee
from mfa for 7 years for committing homicide, a crime
particularly abhorrent to the earth (Ala). Okonkwo's homi-
cide was not premeditated, and because of that, it is a female
ch (manslaughter) for which its penalty is relatively mild.
Mr. Nwaazuru Okoronkwo (oral interview, 2013), a retired
civil servant whom we interviewed, on describing the great
position of Ala (earth deity) says that Ala is the owner of all
men, living and dead. She is responsible for public morality
and offenses against the law are against Ala. They also give
their children names connected with Ala, for example, Ala
emeka--the earth has done a lot, and so forth. From the
above, we can see that the indigenous Igbo man still holds
tenaciously to the cult of Ala, and the entire spirit world is
believed to have its abode under the physical earth on which
the people live and derive their sustenance.
The Igbo Worldview
Ikenga-Metuh (1972) says, ". . . people's world view is defined
as the complex of their beliefs and attitudes concerning the
nature, structure and interaction of beings in the universe with
particular reference to man" (p. 52).According toAgwaraonye
(2014), "Man is at the centre of African worldview and that
every ontological and material activity revolves around man
and is geared towards his welfare and happiness." Among the
4 SAGE Open
Igbo, the universe is conceived as two worlds, the visible and
invisible. All beings belong to either of these two worlds.
Lying at the core of this worldview is the conception of hierar-
chy of beings, which comprises five classes according to
Ikenga-Metuh, A Supreme Being--Chi ukwu (gods, earth
goddess), human beings (Ndiche), totem animals such as Eke
Idemili (the sacred python), tree gods such as Akp, j, and
so forth and physical features such as river gods and gods of
evil forest. Parrinder (1975), in his book West African Religion,
discusses the beings under four headings: The Supreme God,
the Sky gods, the Mother earth, and other divinities.
Igbo traditional worldview reveals that the journey that
man makes in a lifetime and after his death is cyclical. This
is known as life cycle. In contrast with Christian religion,
there is no idea of eschatology, when all will go to eternal
God for judgment as Christians have it. There are only death
and reincarnation in a cyclical manner. Igbo people believe
in reincarnation but it is only those who lived good lives who
are believed to be capable of coming back to human form.
Those who lived sinful and unprofitable or purposeless lives,
by departing from the moral code of the clan, cannot find
human bodies through which they can reincarnate but instead
are forced to live as unenviable and formless "spirit lives," in
which forms of existence, according to Isichei (1976), their
delight is mainly to harm their more fortunate members who
led good lives.
Christianity in Igbo Land
Christians believe in the life on earth now and then the escha-
tological kingdom that is yet to come. Christianity was suc-
cessfully planted on September 24, 1842, in Nigeria by Rev.
Thomas Birth Freeman of Methodist missionary (Ukaoha,
2014). Nwankiti (1975) argues that the origins of Christian
missionary work in Nigeria antedated the Egba (Abeokuta
enterprise). It arrived in Igbo land in 1857. So, with the
advent of Christianity in 1857, the traditional religion had a
serious rival. At first, the problem which Christianity pre-
sented to the traditional religion was not regarded as a seri-
ous matter by the people because conversion to Christianity
at the initial stage was not an easy task because Christianity
was a new religion and something brought to Igbo nation by
European missionaries: Rev. Schon and his associates at the
shores of the River Niger.
The Igbo feared that if they become Christians, their gods
would bring disaster to them. Diviners and medicine men
reported that the divinities were angry because of the new
religion and warned that nobody should join the missionar-
ies. Others refused to embrace the new religion because they
thought that the missionaries wanted to destroy their culture.
Despite these reasons and threats, Christianity began to win
converts in Igbo land. They had village church-school teach-
ers called church agents. These agents were very active in
molding the attitude of the converts, especially the young,
toward the traditional society. Most of them, half educated
and in many cases utterly misguided, contributed signifi-
cantly to open disrespect for and disregard of the society's
time-honored customs and religious practices.
Churches and schools were built and youths and children
were made to attend schools. These children were adoles-
cents and they were campaigners for converts. This method
of conversion conforms to Ifemesia's (1972) assertion,
which runs thus: "The Christian missionaries were the
object of education and religious instruction; and converting
the younger people into Christianity was easier, since the
young were believed not to be rooted in the ancestral ideas
and practices as their fathers" (p. 70). At different times and
places, there were face-to-face encounter with Christians
and traditionalists, because the early Christian missionaries
behaved like social revolutionaries. They plunged into the
condemnation and eradication of traditional religion.
Traditional music and song, drama, and dance were totally
denounced as bad and immoral. Statues, images, and
emblems of remarkable artistic work and aesthetic merit
were wantonly destroyed by some of the overzealous con-
verts as idols and works of the devil. The missionaries were
not prepared to face traditional religion. These acts set the
stage for conflicts, which soon ensued between the Christians
and the traditionalists.
Methods of Data Collection and
Analysis
Data for this study were collected using both primary and
secondary sources. The primary sources include oral inter-
views that were collected through face-to-face interaction
with the interviewees, which were aimed at eliciting first-
hand information on their knowledge of the subject matter.
The interview schedule specifically targeted people with rich
knowledge of the issue under investigation. Such people
included traditionalists, missionaries, scholars of church his-
tory, and so forth. The secondary sources included, among
others, materials such as textbooks, journal articles, encyclo-
pedia, and Internet materials. These secondary materials
helped the researchers to know the state of the art and make
a qualitative analysis of the issues involved in the topic.
The study further adopted the qualitative descriptive and
comparative methods in the analysis of data so collected. The
qualitative method enabled the researchers to make valid
deductions from the secondary data, whereas the compara-
tive method helped to make counterfactual analysis of both
the secondary and primary data sources as they relate to the
traditional and Christian ethos. Concretely, the values and
the ritual rites of the traditional religion of the Igbo people of
southeastern Nigeria were analyzed side by side with the
Christian values and ritual rites. Consequently, the areas of
conflicts between the traditional religion of the Igbo and
those of Christianity were identified. At the end, suggestions
that will make for healthier relationship and coexistence
between the two religions were made.

Conflict Areas
Just as in the recent times, the early Christian church had
conflicts with religions and cultures that do not share same
doctrines with it. In line with this view, Boer (1976) says that
the early Christian had bitter conflicts with the authorities
that arose over how precisely to confess what the church
believes about the person of Jesus Christ. It is necessary to
have the perception of the basic concept of the word "con-
flict" before exploring the extensive area of conflicts between
African Traditional Religion and Christianity. Conflict is a
reality. It does not exist in a vacuum or up there in the blues
but among humans. It is unavoidable in human interaction.
Conflict has been defined variously by different scholars
under different ideological, historical, and cultural influ-
ences. However, Francis (2007) defines conflict as the, "pur-
suit of incompatible interests and goals by different groups."
Yet, a more elaborate definition was given by Phil-Eze
(2009). He posits, "Conflict is the expression of disagree-
ment over something important to two individuals, groups,
states or nations when they have different views, different
goals, different needs and different values and they fight over
limited resources to address them" (p. 393). This study
adopts the above two definitions of conflict.
Totem and Sacred Animals
After the advent of Christianity in Igbo nation, there was no
town-wide conflict between traditional religion and
Christianity. But conflicts later started creeping in from some
converted Christians who felt that because they had been
converted to Christianity, that they were no longer bound by
the norms of the traditional religion. They thought that they
could violate with impunity, the sanctions of the traditional
religion. These first overzealous converts started to ignore
and to violate what the people regarded as taboos and abomi-
nations. In some parts of Igbo nation, there are certain ani-
mals regarded under the traditional religion as sacred and
are, therefore, not hunted or killed for food. Such animals are
respected and treated kindly by the adherents of traditional
religion and to harm them is a serious taboo, the violation of
which is regarded as ns-ala (abomination). But in
Christianity, according to the book of Galatians, everything
created by God is pure and clean. Man has dominion over
them, and as such, can kill and eat them. In Anambra state
(one of the major Igbo states in Nigeria), eke (the royal
python) is regarded as a totem and nobody can deliberately
kill it without incurring the ostracism of the people. If an eke
killer is not killed by the mob, he definitely faces social
ostracism, and when he eventually dies, he will not be given
an honorable burial under the traditional religion. What most
early Christians in Anambra area did was to kill the eke
Idemili (the sacred python belonging to Idemili deity) delib-
erately and use them as food. Not only that, they killed and
ate this totem animal, they put its head inside match boxes
which when picked up and opened by the traditional reli-
gionists, they had to offer special sacrifices to cleanse them-
selves from the abomination because they had seen the head
of eke (Royal python). This brought the first physical conflict
between the traditional religionists and the Christians in that
part of Igbo nation. Chinua Achebe in his novel, Things Fall
Apart also recorded the situation when Nwoye, Okonkwo's
son, was converted. He hunted and locked up the royal
python in his missionary box. That action of his worsened his
already sour relationship with his father and the people of
Umuofia.
Eating Fishes From Sacred Streams
Also in some parts of Igbo land such as Njaba LGA of Imo
state, Udi and Nsukka areas of Enugu state, Awka, Nkpor,
Ogidi, Aguleri, an so forth, all in Anambra state, the early
Christian converts not only went out regularly to convert
their heathen neighbors to Christianity but also showed their
contempt for the traditional taboos: for example, eating the
forbidden fish from certain streams in the towns. Tradition
had it that the fishes were not allowed to be touched or killed,
for they were dedicated to the god of the stream, but the
Christian converts caught and ate them just to show that the
gods of the stream had no powers to harm them, because God
created all things for man's use. The action pained and
annoyed the traditional worshippers. They left the converts
to the vengeance of the gods but the gods seemed to have
taken no notice. The natives started to fight for the gods by
ostracizing the Christian converts.
Osu/Ohu (Outcasts/Slaves)
The Igbo osu caste system is a practice of traditional religion
and culture. Caste system also exists in Egypt, among the
Hebrews, in China, in Japan, among the Germans, and in
Russia, Spain, and Portugal (Ndulor, 2014). It is a taboo in
most Igbo communities and in fact, an abomination for a free
born to get married an Osu/Ohu. It is also a taboo for a free
born (nwa af), to sleep under the same roof with an osu.
When Christianity came, the missionaries condemned human
sacrifice and outcast system. Both Osu and Ohu and other
converts started to worship God together in the same church,
for in the sight of God, all men are equal. The traditionalists
frowned at it but the new Christian converts did not mind
having Christian fellowship with the outcasts.
It is important to note that the Osu caste system officially,
has been abolished by the Eastern House of Assembly. It is
no longer an abomination for a free born to marry an osu/ohu
because an enterprising ohu could buy back his freedom and
could marry into the household of his master. King Jaja of
Opobo was a typical example. He not only bought his free-
dom but also went ahead to found the Opobo Kingdom where
he became the king. But in the present-day Igbo nation, ohu,
in some Igbo states have their freedom but for osu, it is not
6 SAGE Open
yet fully practiced. No wonder Mamah, Ujumadu, Okoli,
Nkwopara, and Okutu (2016) state, "Eastern House of
Assembly on May 10, 1956 abrogated the obnoxious prac-
tice through an Act of Parliament, but 60 years after, this has
not done the required magic . . ." According to Sir Ogbonna
Emmanuel (oral interview, 2016), the issue of free born and
osu led to a bloody communal clash in Alor-Uno in Nsukka
LGA of Enugu State in 2016. Many lives and property were
lost. "The propagators of the crisis are all Christians," said
Sir Ogbonna. Members of Alor-Uno community socially and
politically marginalized their brothers in the name of osu
caste system. Even to date, most Christian converts are not
courageous enough to put their Christian belief into practice
in the equality of human beings, by marrying an Osu or Ohu,
for they know that the person and his family will be ostra-
cized by all his kindred, who ironically are more of Christians.
Health Care
The health condition of the natives before the arrival of the
missionaries was so deplorable. And, the mortality rate in
Nigeria was appalling. There was no known cure for some
deadly diseases, which went wild rapidly and caused a heavy
death toll among the people. Besides, there was total lack of
knowledge concerning many of these diseases (Asadu,
2014). In Igbo nation, methods of dealing with diseases, mis-
fortune, and suffering were marked as areas of conflict
between traditional religion and Christianity. Christians were
opposed to almost all the methods, which the traditionalists
used when they were ill, or when they got misfortune and
suffering. Before the advent of Christianity, the medicine
men in Igbo nation acted as counselors. Some of them acted
not only as doctors but as listeners to people's multifarious
problems. They also acted as priests and prayed for their
communities. But Christian doctors are unlike medicine men
of the traditional religion of the Igbo. The villagers of the
different Igbo communities think that diseases were cured by
these doctors with drugs and not by any ritual ceremony as
they believed.
Sorcery, Magic Charms, and Witchcraft
In the traditional society, when something goes wrong in the
welfare of the individual or his family, he immediately won-
dered who had caused it to happen. In most cases, the indi-
vidual would suspect that someone had used evil magic,
sorcery, or witchcraft against him or his household, animals,
or fields. Whereas the traditional religionists hate and fear
these forces, Christians do not believe that sorcerers, witches,
and charms have any effect on people or their property.
Christians condemned magic; they use prayers and sacra-
ment to drive away dangers and difficulties. So, according to
Nze Ugwoshie Madu (oral interview, 2015), in situations
where a diviner or diba (native doctor) was consulted for
solutions to family problem to appease the gods, Christian
converts in the family insisted that prayer through their
priests would be the solution.
Modes of Worship
Hastings (1911) has defined worship as comprising all modes
of giving expression to the various feelings toward the divine
power, feelings of awe, reverence, obligation, depreciation,
gratitude, hope, and others. The Igbo people, who profess
traditional religion, worship the Supreme Being through
many minor gods or divinities. Those who profess
Christianity, worship God directly through church services,
prayers, songs, meditation, and through other various ser-
vices. There are shrines erected for the worship of the lesser
gods by the traditionalists. There is no shrine for the worship
of the Supreme God for they believe that the Supreme God is
invisible and that his domain is the sky and that He is also a
transcendent God. For this reason, they make use of the
minor gods and ancestors called intermediaries. For
Christians, the worship of God is effectively performed by
the ordained priests and their agents, the catechist, and lay
readers. They regard the holy saints and angels as Gods mes-
sengers. "This also shows that Christianity believes in inter-
mediaries but what and who serves as the intermediary is the
problem," says Chief Raphael Ojike (oral interview, 2016).
Christians also oppose certain aspects of traditional wor-
ship such as human sacrifice, blood sacrifice, twin killing,
and other fetish items used in sacrifice. Based on this
Christian belief, new converts no longer partake in tradi-
tional family festivals and thanksgiving. And, their tradi-
tional parents and or guardians see this as rebellion that
deserves punishment because they believe that the sin of one
member of the family affects the whole family.
Massive Destruction/Demolition of Shrines and
Sacred Grooves
The massive destruction/demolition of shrines and sacred
groves is another conflict area. Perhaps, this explains why
Wotogbe-Weneka (2013) opines, "The huge resource that
would otherwise be generated through tourism industry
which is encouraged by government nowadays is lost through
reckless destruction of sacred groves" (p. 10). Most of these
groves house costly masks that were traded by barter for a
piece of singlet, sugar, or mirror to the missionaries, which
today are displayed for tourist attraction in many European
museums. Christianity believes that God is worshipped in
the church not in groves, and as such, wasting the groves for
idol worship was not acceptable to them.
Prayers and Libations
No worship in traditional religion is complete without prayer
and pouring of libation to ancestors. The father, who is the head
of the home, prays very early in the morning before he could
Okeke et al. 7
even greet anybody. It takes the form of saying "Good morn-
ing" to the divinities and of reaffirming his acknowledgments
of them to be the controllers of destiny. Conflict arises in the
worship of ancestors. Christianity preaches that there is only
one God, the creator of everything and that no worship could
be given to any other false god. But Dr. Ekweremadu Boniface
(oral interview, 2015) draws our attention to the fact that tradi-
tional religionists pray and pour libation to worthy ancestors
believed to have lived righteously during their lifetime on
earth. And, one begins to wonder the difference between this
traditional practice and Christian's ceremony on November 1
and 2 (All Saints' and All Souls' Days), the days set aside for
remembering the Christian brethren whom they believed lived
righteously and died in Christ. Christians refused to partake in
annual festivals of the ancestors, which have ceremonial ritu-
als. This eventually results in great discrimination and brings
estrangement in their relationship with the traditionalist.
Birth and Naming
In Igbo nation, the birth of a child is accompanied by various
rites, which involve presentation to ancestors and the cleans-
ing of the mother from the "pollution" at childbirth. The "pol-
lution" of childbirth may be performed after three native days
depending on the part of Igbo nation. This practice is also the
same in Christianity, where a woman after childbirth offers
live animals and special cleansing prayer to God, for readmit-
tance into the Christian folk (see Leviticus 12:1-8 and Luke
2:22-24). After that, the naming of the child and its presenta-
tion to the people follows. Some factors determine the name
given to a child, and this is where conflict arises with the
Christian belief. According to Ilogu (1974), three factors usu-
ally determine the name given to a child. They are as follows:
1. The day of the native week on which the child is born
(and Christianity believes that the days of the Igbo
native week: Eke, Orie, Af, and Nkw are named
after deities. But they forgot that apart from August,
named after Caesar Augustus, that January to
December are all names of Jewish deities, see Ozioko,
2016, for details).
2. The historical incident peculiar to the child's birth or
to the circumstances of the parents.
3. The philosophical or socioreligious faith, which the
child stimulates in the parents.
After the naming ceremony, there is gba afa ag (as it is
called by the Obosi, Abattete, Umuoji, and Nkpor people of
Idemili-North LGA of Anambra state). This is the ceremony
of finding out the ancestral relationship of the newborn child
through divination. Agbaogwugwu people of Enugu state
call such reincarnated child ag m (my rib), whereas it is
called ogbo m (myself) in Ngwo and most towns in Eziagu
and Udi LGAs of Enugu State, including many other towns
(Okposi, Abankeleke, Uburu, etc.) in Ebonyi State. In
opposition, Christians do not accept the traditional beliefs of
naming ceremonies. Christians believe that as God is the cre-
ator of every human being, names should relate to him. Often
coercion is used to force Christians to perform the naming
rites. Of course, some Christians do resist.
Initiation Rites
Christians have no puberty ceremonial rites. Children are
baptized sometimes as infants, in the early youth, and some-
times in later years as the case may be. Christians in Igbo
communities vehemently oppose the traditional rites of
puberty, which they regard as heathenish and ungodly. In
some Igbo towns today, the initiation into the masquerade
cult is still causing a lot of conflicts between fanatical
Christians and the traditionalists.
Marriage Customs
Christian marriage is different from traditional marriage in
Igbo nation. In traditional marriage, the religious aspects
include the preliminary divination by which the young man
who seeks a wife is enabled to find out from what clan or
lineage his Chi (Guardian Spirit) permits him to take a wife
of fortune from. When the diviner pronounces the clan or
lineage and the girl is found, all the preliminaries are finished
and the bride price is paid, the girl is ready to go and settle in
her new husband's home (there may be little modification
depending on the area in question)
Christians are opposed to this aspect of traditional mar-
riage. They contend that their own way of marriage is the
ideal as revealed by God. But how far is the ideal Christian
marriage as revealed by God separable from the traditional
marriage? This is the question often asked by some tradition-
alists. They argue that the Christian marriage and many
Christian families are failures in traditional marriage life,
going by the number of Christian divorces prevalent now.
Another area of conflict is polygamy. The traditionalists
believe that the number of wives a man has shows his opu-
lence. The number of wives often determines the number of
children. And, one of the major reasons of having many chil-
dren according to Mr. Enem Ignatius (oral interview, 2015) is
to have enough labor for farming, which is their major occu-
pation. But the idea of polygamy runs contrary to the
Christian doctrine of monogamy, which believes in one man,
one wife. Many Christians are in dilemma when they have
marital problems such as childlessness or problem of gender
mix in the children. If ever the man defies the church order
and marries more than one wife, he is made a backslider. He
is denied the Holy Communion and other church rights.
Burial Ceremonies
One of the other areas of conflict between the traditional reli-
gion and Christianity in Igbo nation is in burial ceremonies.
8 SAGE Open
The traditional religious view in Igbo concept of death is that
a man is dead when his soul leaves the body for the land of
the dead (Eke, 2014). The traditionalist performs some ritu-
alistic ceremonies before burying a dead person. Christians
oppose such ceremonies. In most part of Igbo traditional
society, there are rituals concerning the preparation of the
corpse for burial. Diviners are consulted to find out the cause
of death. In the olden days, the traditionalists buried impor-
tant personalities, chiefs, and titled men with people who
were alive. The aim is to give the deceased company to the
land of the spirits. Other material wealth such as gold, money,
and many other ornaments were buried with dead bodies.
The early missionaries highly frowned at the practice. After
sometime, a year or more, the second burial would take place
with a lot more elaborate ceremonies than the first. If the
second burial was not performed, according to Mr. Enem,
Ignatius (oral interview, 2015), the proper inheritance of the
late father's property could not be finally settled (the above
practice according to him is still in existence in some Igbo
communities such as Iwolo, Nenwe and Nkanu in Enugu
State, Ohaozaro, and Abiriba in Abia State). Christians chal-
lenged many traditional burial ceremonies. They opposed the
traditional second burial rites. And, the traditional religion-
ists believe that this burial rite helps the spirit of the dead
person reach the spirit world, join his ancestors, and enable
him or her to reincarnate.
Also, in some parts of Igbo land, some towns such as
Ngor-Okpala in Imo state, Umuahia in Abia State, and many
towns in Anambra State, when someone's wife dies, her
corpse must be carried to her father's people before the first
burial or a symbol of such corpse at the second burial cere-
mony will be carried to the husband's family. Presently, the
ambulance may stop over at the dead wife's paternal com-
pound and the corpse saluted with many canon guns shots.
This is done in most Igbo communities to certify that the
dead wife has been brought to her own people. This practice
persists till today in all Igbo communities. Christians are
opposed to this kind of ceremony. Presently, according to
Rev. Canon Onuorah Nnamdi (oral interview, 2016), in the
Niger Diocese of the Anglican Communion, Anambra State,
a brief stopover in the dead wife's paternal home is an offense
punishable by the absence of the priests and church members
in the funeral service of the deceased. They frown at the
practice of carrying the corpse of a dead wife back to her
father's compound or even stopping over as we have seen.
Instead, they bury the dead wives in the church cemeteries of
their husbands'town or in their husbands'compounds. There
are cases of kinsmen and the Christians struggling for the
corpses of Christian relations.
In some cases, the relatives of the dead wife would spark
off trouble with their in-laws because they are opposed to
Christian marriage, stating that Christians deprived them of
their traditional rites and customs. According to Mr. Sunday
Iweobi (oral interview, 2013), there are cases where the gba
Nkw ceremony (traditional wedding ceremony) has to be
performed before the burial of the deceased wife. This situa-
tion arises, especially when the husband did not finish the
marriage rites because of his Christian faith or due to negli-
gence of traditional marriage customs or because of other
reasons, before the wife died. Sometimes, according to Mr.
Iweobi, Sunday (oral interview, 2013), it might be that the
deceased was maltreated, and his in-laws would not let go.
They would insist on the completion of such traditional mar-
riage rites as a sort of punishment to the husband, which
ordinarily they would have overlooked.
Again, Mr. Iweobi, Sunday (oral interview, 2013) says
that sometimes, the funeral ceremonies of dead relatives that
were not done in the past (due to one reason or the other) are
organized before that of a relative who died recently. In the
same vein, Oreh (2014) identifies the principal dehumaniz-
ing widowhood rites and practices to include the following:
drinking water used in washing husband's corpse, crawling
over husband's corpse, long mourning and restriction period,
loss of right of inheritance (if she has no male child), sitting
on bare floor during the period of mourning, a widow not
having bath until eight market days (28 days), and so forth.
Christianity frowns at such practices and warns its members
never to partake in them. These are some of the areas where
the two religions conflict. From the above conflicts, we can
see that although Christianity has made some impact on Igbo
people, it has not totally changed their worldview.
Suggestions
The findings of this study show vividly that the two religions
have their strengths and weaknesses. The writers, therefore,
suggest that Christians in Igbo communities should leave
their opposition to traditional religion because they have
given rise to disintegration and lack of unity. The Christians
should rather brace themselves for inculcating the revelation
contents of Christianity, namely, existence of one God for all
men, reconciliation to the source of reality and brotherhood
of man under the fatherhood of God.
Because every family in Igbo land is made up of Christians
and traditionalists, they should not shun one another but
should discuss their differences, especially the Christians
who are in the majority. The Christians should take it as their
duty to teach and explain to the traditionalists the objective
definition of religion. They should try to review/modify the
traditional method of worship, especially during family
meetings. The two should realize that both of them are virtu-
ally doing the same thing. For instance, the traditionalist
would argue that shrine and church are the same, where God
meets His people and communes with them (Madam Nwaku
Anwaegbu, oral interview, 2013), or the issue of All Saints'
and All Souls' Days (see section "Prayers and Libations").
Christians should also know that the traditionalists have
implicit faith in their ancestors and minor deities because in
reality, as the traditionalists look to their religion for answers
to those profound mysteries of human conditions that stir the
Okeke et al. 9
human hearts today as it did in years gone by, so also do
Christians look to their own religion. The church authorities
should sermonize and try as much as possible to encourage
the adherents of traditional religion to drop those obnoxious
practices that make their religion look evil. Only when these
are done, will the conflict between traditional religion and
Christianity in Igbo land be reduced.
Summary and Conclusion
From this explanation, one can easily see that the problems
of Igbo Christians are those of a man practicing a new reli-
gious system, amid a traditional order that has not yet disap-
peared. The conflicts that exist between traditional religion
and Christianity in Igbo land are moral, ideological, and
physical, though more moral than physical in the sense that
the moral conflict did not develop into a serious civil strug-
gle between the traditionalists and Christians. Moreover, the
moral conflict (which, in some cases, had been the result of
clash in conscience experienced by individual Christians
between the tenets of Christianity and those of the traditional
religion) was not the official support given by Christian
authorities against the traditional religion and its followers,
but was purely the effect of a clash in religious beliefs, which
naturally existed between the adherents of the traditional
religion and those of the Christian faith in Igbo nation. The
study validates the facts that there is occasional destruction
of lives and property and demolition of the people's artifacts
and groves by Christians, and this has led to a reduction in
the sources of economic generation of traditional religion-
ists. Second, the number of tourist sites available in many
Igbo towns has reduced by 80% because of the activities of
Christians. It has also led to syncretism in the people's cul-
ture and has given rise to disintegration and lack of unity
among the people. Sometimes, to avoid conflict, many fami-
lies now combine the tenets of the two religions. For instance,
after performing the full traditional marriage rites, the church
wedding will follow. The same goes for burial and other
social ceremonies. Finally, it has helped in refining some
obnoxious beliefs and practices of the Igbo race.
