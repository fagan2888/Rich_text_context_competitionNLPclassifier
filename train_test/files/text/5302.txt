Abstract
Objective: This retrospective study compared the effect of the luteal phase ovarian stimulation
protocol (LP group) with the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol (AN
group) in women with poor ovarian responses.
Methods: Ovarian stimulation was initiated with 225 IU of human gonadotrophin (hMG) daily.
When the dominant follicle diameter exceeded 13 mm, 0.25 mg of a GnRH antagonist was used
daily until human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) administration in the AN group. A GnRH
antagonist was not used in the LP group. Ovulation was induced with HCG for all patients when at
least one follicle reached a diameter of 16 mm or one dominant follicle reached 18 mm. The highest
quality embryos were transferred or cryopreserved for later transfer.
Results: From January 2013 to December 2015, 274 women with poor ovarian response were
included. A total of 108 patients underwent the luteal phase ovarian stimulation protocol while 166
patients underwent the GnRH antagonist protocol. hMG was used for more total days in the LP
group was than in the AN group. Oestradiol levels on the day of HCG administration in the LP
group were significantly lower than those in the AN group. The mean number of oocytes retrieved
in the LP and AN groups was 3.5 Æ 2.5 and 3.5 Æ 2.9, respectively. The mean number of embryos of
the highest quality was 1.7 Æ 1.2 and 1.7 Æ 1.5, respectively. The clinical pregnancy and implantation
rates in the LP and AN groups were 26.2% (22/84) and 25% (29/116), and 15.5% (24/155) and
16.3% (35/215), respectively.
Conclusions: The luteal phase ovarian stimulation protocol can be applied in women with poor
ovarian response and attain comparable clinical pregnancy and implantation rates to those of the
GnRH antagonist protocol.

Introduction
One of the most important prognostic fac-
tors is ovarian reserve for achievement of
pregnancy in in vitro fertilization (IVF)
cycles.1 Patients with a poor ovarian
response (POR) are often faced with high
cycle cancellation and low pregnancy
rates.2,3 Some strategies have been suggested
for management of poor responders. The
gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
antagonist protocol has received much
attention recently. This protocol has some
advantages, including less time and cost with
late follicular phase administration of a
GnRH antagonist. Recent evidence has
indicated that follicles developing in the
luteal phase can ovulate in the presence of
a luteinizing hormone (LH) surge.
Therefore, this situation has created more
opportunities to use ovarian stimulation.4
Many investigators have confirmed that
oocytes that are retrieved in the luteal phase
can be fertilized and developed into embryos
in vitro.5­9 Kuang et al.10 observed that luteal
phase ovarian stimulation can produce com-
petent embryos in women aged 20­38 years
with infertility caused by tubal, male, or
unexplained factors. Some researchers have
shown that luteal phase ovarian stimulation
is feasible for obtaining mature oocytes and
good embryos in women with PORs.9 This
study aimed to examine the efficacy of luteal
phase ovarian stimulation in women with
PORs, by comparing IVF outcomes with
GnRH antagonist protocols.
Patients and methods
Study setting and patients
The data for this study were retrieved from
patients' medical records from January 2013
to December 2015. According to the
Bologna criteria,11 the patients had at least
two of the following characteristics:
(1) advanced maternal age (!40 years old);
(2) a previous POR ( 3 oocytes with a con-
ventional stimulation protocol); and (3) an
abnormal ovarian reserve test (antral follicle
count of <5­7 follicles). Two episodes of
POR after maximal stimulation were suffi-
cient to define a patient as a poor responder
in the absence of advanced maternal age or
abnormal ovarian reserve test.
The study was approved by the Ethical
Committee of Reproductive Medicine of
Linyi People's Hospital (Shandong
Province, China). Written informed con-
sents were obtained from all participants.
Procedures
A total of 274 patients (337 cycles) were
enrolled from our computerized IVF data-
base. A total of 108 patients (113 cycles)
underwent the luteal phase ovarian stimula-
tion protocol (LP). Between 0 and 24 hours
after spontaneous ovulation or oocyte
retrieval, patients with at least one follicle
of <8 mm remaining were administered
Highly Purified Menotrophin (Ferring
Gmbh, Wittland 11, Germany) in a 225-IU
IM injection until the day of human chori-
onic gonadotrophin (HCG) administration
(Figure 1).
During the same time interval, 166
patients (224 cycles) underwent the GnRH
antagonist protocol (AN). On day 2 of the
menstrual cycle, 225 IU of Highly Purified
Menotrophin (Ferring GmbH Wittland 11)
daily was commenced. When the leading
follicle exceeded 13 mm in diameter, 0.25 mg
of GnRH antagonist (Cetrotide; Merck-
Serono, Switzerland) was started daily
1732 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
until the day of HCG administration
(Figure 2).
Transvaginal ultrasound examination for
all patients was performed to record the
diameter of developing follicles, and serum
oestradiol (E2) concentrations were mea-
sured. The criterion for recombinant HCG
(Profasi; Merck-Serono, Switzerland)
administration was that at least one follicle
diameter reached 16 mm or one dominant
follicle reached 18 mm. A total of 36 hours
after recombinant HCG injection, oocyte
aspiration was performed, which was guided
by transvaginal ultrasound.
Fertilization was performed in vitro, by
IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection,
relying on semen parameters. The embryos
were examined and graded depending on the
number and regularity of the blastomeres
and embryonic fragmentation according
to Cummins criteria.12 All of the highest
quality embryos (including the 2­4 rated
embryos) were transferred or frozen by
vitrification on the second or third day
after oocyte retrieval.
Endometrial preparation in frozen
embryo transfer was performed in an artifi-
cial cycle or a natural cycle as previously
described.10,13
A b-HCG blood test was used to detect
pregnancy on day 14 after transplantation.
If pregnancy was achieved, progesterone
application was continued until 12 weeks
of gestation.
Statistical analysis
The clinical definition of pregnancy was
defined as a gestational sac being detected
by ultrasonography. The implantation rate
was the total number of gestational sacs
demonstrated by ultrasonography divided
by the total number of transferred embryos.
The miscarriage rate was defined as the

proportion of patients with spontaneous
abortion of the total pregnancy. The data
are shown as the meanÆ SD and were
analysed by the one-way analysis of variance
method. When the analyses showed signifi-
cance, the groups were compared using the
LSD test. The chi-square or Fisher's exact test
was used to analyse the clinical pregnancy
rate, implantation rate, and miscarriage rate.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically signifi-
cant. Windows SPSS 18.0 software was used
for statistical analysis (SPSS, USA).
Results
Among the 337 cycles, no patient experienced
a premature LH surge or moderate/severe
ovarian hyperstimulation. The baseline char-
acteristics of patients in the two groups are
shown in Table 1. The mean age of female
patients in the study was 37.3 Æ 5.1 years and
37.7Æ 4.9 years. The mean body mass index
was 23.7 Æ 2.9 and 24.4 Æ 3.2kg/m2.
The mean basal follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH) level was 10.9Æ 4.2 mIU/mL and
11.0 Æ 3.6 mIU/mL. Seventy-three cycles
were cancelled because of no oocyte or
embryo. Among the cancelled cycles, two
and 11 cycles were cancelled because of no
oocytes in the LP and AN groups, respect-
ively. Among the cancelled cycles, 23 and 37
cycles had no embryo in the LP and AN
groups, respectively. The two groups were
similar in terms of age, body mass index,
mean basal FSH levels, and cancelled cycles
(Table 1).
The mean duration of hMG administra-
tion was 9.9 Æ 2.3 days in the LP group and
8.7 Æ 2.2 days in the AN group (p < 0.001).
The total dose of gonadotrophin stimulation
was higher in the LP group than in the AN
group (Table 2) (p < 0.001). E2 levels on the
day of hCG administration were lower in the
LP group compared with the AN group.
However, the mean number of oocytes was
3.5 Æ 2.5 and 3.5 Æ 2.9, and the mean
number of high quality embryos was
1.7 Æ 1.2 and 1.7 Æ 1.5 in the LP and AN
groups, respectively (Table 2). There were
no significant differences in these variables
between the two groups.
A total of 159 embryos were first thawed
in the LP protocol, and the survival rate was
97.5%. A total of 155 embryos were
transferred. A total of 215 embryos were
transferred in the AN protocol (Table 3).
The clinical pregnancy, implantation and
miscarriage rates were compared between

the two groups (Table 3). A trend of a
higher miscarriage rate (22.7% vs 13.8%;
P ¼ 0.647) was observed in the LP group,
but this was no significant because of the
small number of patients.
Forty of the pregnant women had single
embryos and eight women had twin
embryos. Nine women had miscarriage in
the first trimester, and there were three
ectopic pregnancies. Among the pregnan-
cies, 27 women had given birth, and 12 had
ongoing pregnancies at the end of the study.
There were 24 single births and three twin
births, and no malformations were found in
the newborns (Table 3).
Discussion
Women whose ovarian reserves are too poor
to retrieve sufficient mature oocytes have
less hope of having their own children.
There have been many reports on manage-
ment of a POR to improve ovarian response
and increase IVF outcomes, including the
following: increasing the gonadotrophin
dose; decreasing the GnRH agonist dose,
aromatase inhibitors, and natural cycle; and
using a GnRH antagonist protocol.14
Several studies have shown that luteal
phase ovarian stimulation might be feasible.
Immature oocytes retrieved in the luteal
phase can be successfully matured in vitro.

One possible explanation for the existence of
viable follicles during the luteal phase was
proposed by Baerwald et al.4 Studies have
suggested that oocytes that are obtained
during the luteal phase are able to mature
in vitro in women requiring imminent
chemotherapy.5,6 One patient in the luteal
phase had two mature oocytes on the day of
retrieval.5,6 A bovine model showed that the
maturation and fertilization rates in the
normal menstrual cycle were equal to those
in luteal oocyte retrieval.15 Additionally,
there were no significant differences in the
rates of cleavage and blastocyst formation in
the two groups. After maturing, mature
oocytes that have been recovered in the
luteal phase are able to be fertilized and
form good quality embryos in vitro.7,8 Xu
and Li9 reported a patient who was diag-
nosed with a POR. A mature oocyte
obtained through luteal phase ovarian
stimulation resulted in a cleavage embryo
(8-cell, grade 2). Findings in their case
showed that luteal phase ovarian stimula-
tion might be equally feasible in poor
responders. In our study, oocytes that
were retrieved during the luteal phase were
capable of maturing in vitro and being
fertilized.
Two groups were compared in our study.
The baseline characteristics of the groups
were similar, including cancelled cycles,
female age, basal FSH levels, and body
mass index. However, the total number of
days of stimulation, total dose of gonado-
trophin administered, and E2 levels on the
day of HCG administration were different
between the groups. The total number of
days of HMG used was longer in the
LP protocol compared with the AN protocol.
E2 levels on the day of HCG administration
were significantly lower in the LP protocol
compared with the AN protocol. These dif-
ferences may be due to luteal phase stimula-
tion with the LP protocol. There were no
significant differences in the pregnancy and
implantation rates between the two groups.
The trend of a higher miscarriage rate in the
LP group than that in the AN group might
have been related to the small sample size.
Fertility preservation for cancer patients
involves freezing embryos and oocytes, and
the rate of pregnancy from vitrified oocytes
is acceptable.16,17 Whether oocytes and
embryos that are obtained and frozen in
the luteal phase would result in a compar-
able pregnancy rate is unknown. A previous
study showed that the clinical pregnancy,
ongoing pregnancy, and implantation rates
of frozen embryo transfer were 55.46%,
48.91%, and 40.37%, respectively.10
However, the criteria were women aged
20­38 years with a high ovarian reserve,
and exclusion of PORs.10 The current study
demonstrated that the clinical pregnancy,
ongoing pregnancy, and implantation rates
of frozen embryo transfer with the LP
protocol were 26.2% (22/84), 15% (3/20)
and 15.5% (24/155), respectively, in women
with PORs. These results were better than
the microdose GnRH agonist flare-up
protocol, which was reported by Yarali
et al. and Cenksoy et al.18,19 Yarali et al.18
showed that the clinical pregnancy and
implantation rates were 17.4% and 9.8%,
respectively, in the microdose GnRH agon-
ist flare-up protocol. The miscarriage rate
with the LP protocol in the current study
was 22.7%, which is consistent with previ-
ous reports (23%).18 The cancellation rate
(24.3%) and total dosage of gonadotrophins
(4221 IU) were higher in the current study
(22.1%, 2088 IU) than in Cenksoy et al.'s
study.19 Therefore, continuous stimulation
during the luteal phase could be used in
women with PORs.
An ideal protocol for poor responders
has not been determined. The long protocols
of GnRH agonist administration show
benefits in follicular synchronization.
However, they have the disadvantage of
inhibiting the ovarian response to gonado-
trophins, particularly in patients PORs.
The current study showed that luteal phase
1736 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
ovarian stimulation was feasible for women
with a POR, and ovarian stimulation may be
used in special circumstances. However, this
result might have been caused by the small
sample size. Further prospective, rando-
mized trials are required to evaluate the
effect of such protocols.
