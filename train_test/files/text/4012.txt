This paper estimates the impact of public investment on private investment in India during
1970-2013 using ARDL procedure developed by Pesaran and Shin (1999) and Pesaran,
Shin, and Smith (2001) by incorporating endogenously determined structural break in the
model. The base line result implies that a 1 per cent increase in public investment as a ratio
to GDP leads to 0.81 per cent and 0.53 per cent decrease in private investment as a ratio to
GDP in the long run (about 4 to 5 years) and short run (about 2 to 3 years), respectively,
after controlling for economic conditions. To address the concern that the results may be
driven by government consumption expenditure, fiscal deficit, or inadequate infrastruc-
ture, the analysis was repeated by estimating the investment function after including these
variables and similar results were obtained. The investment regression was also estimated
for a shorter sample period (1978­2013) to get the same result.
It is observed that the crowding out effect of public investment on private investment
has dampened during the post-liberalization period. The results also reveal that a
"market friendly" incumbent and an increase in foreign direct investment dampen the
magnitude of the crowding out effect of public investment. Formal tests were conducted
to examine whether the crowding out effect was driven by political uncertainty and
political business cycle channels but no evidence for the same is found.
The results also reveal that public infrastructure (represented by kms of roads per capita)
has a positive effect on private investment in the short run. This is similar to the find-
ings by Blejer and Khan (1984) that while public infrastructure investment is comple-
mentary to private investment, other kinds of public investment lead to crowding out
of private investment. This suggests that public investment should be more focused on
goods and services which are enjoyed or consumed by many consumers simultaneously
and non-excludable in nature with significant positive externalities.
In this model, a single endogenously determined structural break was included and the
possibility of multiple breaks was excluded. There is a scope to increase multiple struc-
tural breaks and re-investigate the impact of public investment on private investment in
India in future studies.

Summary
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 4 · OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2016 289
In this paper, we estimate the impact of public invest-
ment on private investment in India. Theoretically,
public investment can affect private investment
either positively or negatively. An increase in public
investment is expected to increase private investment
as it allows firms to have a broader access to markets
due to construction of roads, ports, railways, and so
on. An increase in public investment is also expected to
increase private investment by increasing the marginal
productivity of capital (Cavallo & Daude, 2011). At the
same time, public investment can also crowd out private
investment because of a decrease in the availability of
savings to the private sector and/or increase in the cost
of finance. As the theoretical relation between public
and private investment is ambiguous, most studies
resort to empirical evaluation to reach a conclusion.
Studies report mixed results about the impact of public
investment on private investment. For example, Blejer
and Khan (1984) found that the public infrastructure
investment was complementary to private investment
in 24 developing countries during the period 1971­1979.
Aschauer (1989) reported that in the United States, an
increaseinpubliccapitalcrowdedintheprivatecapitalvia
an increase in the marginal productivity of capital. Erden
and Holcombe (2005) also found a positive correlation
between public and private investment for 19 developing
countries during 1980­1997. On the other hand, Cavallo
and Daude (2011) developed a theoretical framework to
evaluate the conditions under which public investment
promoted or hindered private investment and found that
public investment crowded out private investment in a
sample of 116 developing countries during 1980­2006.
Similarly, Everhart and Sumlinski (2001) found a nega-
tive correlation between public and private investment
(consistent with crowding out hypothesis) in 63 devel-
oping countries between 1970 and 2000.
Most of the studies on the impact of public investment
on private investment use multi-country cross-sec-
tional data and, therefore, the results of these studies
are based on the assumption of "homogeneity" in the
observed relationship across countries. This could be
an unrealistic assumption as there are a lot of variations
among countries due to different structural and insti-
tutional factors, which, in turn, might be determining
the impact of public investment on the behaviour of
private investment in a particular country. Also, not
many studies consider the mediating role of economic
liberalization, market-friendly political platform, and
net foreign direct investment in the impact of public
investment on private investment. Few studies incor-
porate structural break in the model when examining
the impact of public investment on private investment.
With this background, this study attempts to investigate
the impact of public investment on private investment
in India during 1970­2013 using the Autoregressive
Distributed Lag (ARDL) procedure (Pesaran & Shin,
1999; Pesaran, Shin, & Smith, 2001) by incorporating
endogenously determined structural break in the
model. The ARDL procedure corrects for possible
endogeneity of the explanatory variables and reveals
the desirable small sample properties of estimators.
We find strong and robust evidence that public invest-
ment crowds out private investment in India. Our base-
line estimates suggest that a 1 per cent increase in public
investment as a ratio of GDP leads to 0.81 per cent and
0.53 per cent decrease in private investment as a ratio of
GDP in the long -run (about 4 to 5 years) and short-run
(about 2 to 3 years)1, respectively, after controlling for
economic conditions. To address the concern that the
results might be driven by government consumption
expenditure, fiscal deficit, or inadequate infrastructure,
we repeat the analysis by estimating our investment
function after including these variables and find similar
results. We also estimate the investment regression for
a shorter sample period (1978­2013) and find the same
result. We find that the estimated effect of public invest-
ment is smaller in magnitude during the post-liberal-
ization period, indicating that economic liberalization
offsets the crowding out effect of public investment
on private investment. We also find that a "market
friendly" incumbency and an increase in foreign direct
investment dampen the magnitude of the crowding out
effect of public investment on private investment.
Private investment is also affected negatively by two
other channels. The first channel is political uncer-
tainty hypothesis. Political uncertainty is expected to
affect private investment negatively because this leads
to policy uncertainty. As a result, rational firms prefer
delaying the investment, until the political uncertainty
is resolved (Julio & Yook, 2012). The second is the polit-
ical business cycle hypothesis. As per political business
cycle theory, incumbent politicians manipulate fiscal
and monetary policy instruments to influence macro-
economic performance prior to an election to enhance
their chances of re-election (Nordhaus, 1975). Therefore,
it is expected that an expansionary fiscal policy would
crowd out private investment. We conduct formal tests
to know whether the crowding out effect is driven
290 THE IMPACT OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT ON PRIVATE INVESTMENT: EVIDENCE FROM INDIA
by these channels and find no evidence that they are
driving our results.
PRIVATE AND PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN INDIA
As can be seen from Figure 1 and Table 1, there is a
substantial variation in the private and public invest-
ment rates. For example, the public investment rate fluc-
tuated between 5.80 and 12.30 per cent and averaged 8.49
per cent during 1970­2013, whereas the rate of private
investment fluctuated between 7.40 and 24.90 per cent
range and averaged 14.04 per cent in the same period.
As there is a considerable variation between both varia-
bles during 1970­2013, the use of regression analysis to
identify the parameters that explain the impact of public
investment on private investment is justified.

Figure 1 shows the trends in the public and private invest-
ment in India during 1970­2013. A pronounced trend is
visible in public investment over time. It increased from
5.8 per cent of GDP in 1970­71 to 12.3 per cent of GDP in
1986­87 before starting to decline to 7.9 per cent of GDP
in 2012­13. On the other hand, private investment as a
percentage of GDP has increased continually during 1970­
2013 from 7.9 per cent of GDP in 1970­1971 to 24.9 per cent
of GDP in 2006­2007 after which it declined marginally
to 23.6 per cent in 2012­13. The crowding out hypothesis
predicts that the public investment has a significant impact
on private investment. Specifically, there is a negative rela-
tionship between public and private investments. If we
compare trends in private investment with trends in public
investmentovertime,thedownwardtrendinpublicinvest-
ment coincides with the upward trend in private invest-
ment since 1986­87. The correlation coefficient between
public and private investment as a percentage of GDP in
1970­2013 is also found to be equal to ­ 0.34. These suggest
that the former might have caused the latter.

public investment is expected to affect private invest-
ment either positively or negatively. An increase in
public investment is expected to increase private
investment through creating basic infrastructural facil-
ities such as highways, railways, ports, and so on. A
few studies (e.g., Aschauer, 1989; Blejer & Khan, 1989;
Erden & Holcombe, 2005) have found that an increase
in public investment led to an increase in private
investment. On the contrary, crowding out hypothesis
suggests that an increase in public investment may lead
to a decrease in private investment either by increasing
interest rate or by utilizing financial and physical
resources, which would otherwise be available for the
private sector. A number of studies (e.g., Cavallo &
Daude, 2011; Everhart & Sumlinski, 2001; Morrissey &
Udomkerdmongkol, 2012) provide empirical support
to this assertion from crowding out hypothesis.
Private investment also depends on the lending rate.
According to Keynesians, given the expected rate of
return, a decrease in the lending rate increases invest-
ment, which, in turn, increases, economic growth
via multiplier mechanism. Peltonen, Sousa, and
Vansteenkiste (2012) found the real lending rate as
an important determinant of investment in emerging
market economies.
Investment also depends on the availability or supply
of credit. In contrast to the neo- classical theory, which
assumes that firms have access to unlimited supply
credit, most developing countries are often char-
acterized by credit constraint. This is due to asym-
metric information, directed credit programmes, and
controlled interest rates. These imperfections in credit
markets prevent firms from borrowing as much as they
wish and discourage investment. The removal of such
credit constraints increases the availability of funds for
investment and is therefore expected to increase invest-
ment according to the debt intermediation view (Shaw,
1973).Anumber of studies report bank credit as a signif-
icant determinant of investment (Peltonen et al., 2012;
Cavallo & Daude 2011; Athukorala, 1998).
Another important determinant of investment is the
relative price of an investment. An increase in the price
of capital goods relative to the price of all other goods
and services is expected to have a negative impact on
investment as it affects their profit. It is found that an
increase in the relative price of investment leads to a
decrease in private investment (Peltonen et al., 2012;
Cavallo & Daude, 2011).
The deposit rate too has an impact on investment.
According to McKinnon (1973), in a financially
repressed economy, it is difficult for economic agents to
find required resources from the external source to make
investment on account of non-price credit rationing.
Secondly, physical capital is often indivisible. Hence,
it becomes necessary for potential investors (savers) to
accumulate saving for some time in the form of mone-
tary assets (mostly currency and deposits) before they
use it for lum sump investments. As long as the rate
of return on deposit is less than the rate of return on
physical capital, an increase in deposit rate encourages
accumulation of deposits (internal funds) by making
deposit accumulation more rewarding, which, in turn,
increases the investment subsequently according to
McKinnon's "complementarity hypothesis." Therefore,
an increase in deposit rate leads to an increase in invest-
ment. Previous studies (e.g., Athukorala, 1998; Moore,
2010) report that increase in deposit rate leads to an
increase in private investment.
Another factor that affects private investment is the
accelerator mechanism. As per the accelerator theory
of business cycle, an increase in output and sales
puts pressure on existing productive capacity. Hence,
firms decide to expand their productive capacity
and hence investment. A few previous studies (e.g.,
Athukorala 1998; Julio & Yook 2012; Morrissey &
Udomkerdmongkol 2012; Peltonenet al., 2012; ) have
reported that the growth rate of GDP has a positive
effect on private investment.
On the basis of the above discussions, we specify the
empirical private investment function as follows:
Private Investment =  (Public Investment, Lending
Rate, Bank Credit, Relative Price of Investment, Deposit
Rate, and the Growth Rate)
The independent variables with their expected signs in

Data and Econometric Procedure
We use annual data for the variables from 1970­1971
to 2012­2013. The dataset, including the definition and
sources of all variables, is summarized in Appendix 1.
Theassumptionsoftheclassicallinearregressionmodel
require that both the dependent and independent
variables are stationary. In the presence of non-sta-
tionary variables, there might be what Granger and
Newbold (1974) called a spurious regression. A
spurious regression has a high R2, significant t-sta-
tistics, but the results are without any economic
meaning. Therefore, the first econometric step we have
taken is to test if the series are non-stationary by using
Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests. The Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) determines the appro-
priate number of first differences of the dependent
variable for the ADF test. The null hypothesis of the
test is that the un-differenced form of the series is
non-stationary or contains a unit root.
Table 2 presents the ADF unit root test results for all
variables. All variables do not have the same order of
integration. Variables such as private investment, public
investment, bank credit, the relative price of invest-
ment are non-stationary, whereas real lending rate,
real deposit rate, and growth rate are stationary. But all
non-stationary variables are found to be stationary in
their first difference I(1) (See Table 2).
However, a well-known weakness of the ADF test is
that it may fail to reject the unit root hypothesis if the
series has a structural break. Perron (1989) showed that
the absence of an existing structural break leads to a
bias that reduces the ability of the ADF test to reject
a false unit root null hypothesis. Figure 1 exhibits a
strong possibility of structural breaks in both public
and private investment, particularly during the post-re-
form period. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct the
unit root test that allows for the structural break. Zivot
and Andrews (1992) unit root test allows one structural
break in the series which is determined endogenously.

The null hypothesis is that the series has a unit root with
one structural break against the alternative hypothesis
that the series is stationary with break. There are two
advantages of applying the unit root test that allows
for the presence of structural break. First, it prevents
obtaining a test result that may be biased towards
non-rejection of the null hypothesis. Secondly, as it
identifies the date of the structural break, it becomes
easier to analyse whether a structural break of a series
is associated with a particular event such as a change in
government policy, a currency crisis and so on.
The results of Zivot­Andrews unit root test are
presented in Table 3. They suggest that private invest-
ment, public investment, bank credit, the relative price
of investment have unit root with structural breaks,
whereas real deposit rate is stationary with a structural
break. The results confirm the ADF test results except
for the lending rate. However, all non-stationary varia-
bles are found to be stationary in their first differences,
that is, they are I(I) (See Table 3).
As expected, a structural break in private investment is
identified in 1995­96 (see Figure 2 and Table 3), which is
due to various structural reforms that were carried out
during the first half of the 1990s. The reforms included
decontrolling of private investment, opening up the
economy to foreign trade and foreign investment,
financial sector reforms, etc. According to Parker (1995),
"the behaviour of investment in the post reform period
can be divided into three distinct phases: the crisis of
1991/92, when private capital formation contracted
sharply; the period 1992/93-1993/94, in which invest-
ment remained sluggish despite an easing of financial
conditions and an improved economic outlook; and the
period 1994/95-1995/96 for which there is evidence
of a robust and broad based investment recovery" (p.
28). Therefore, we conclude that private investment has
undergone a structural break in 1995­96.
As most of the variables are found to be non-sta-
tionary, the next step is to test the possibility of one
or more cointegrating relationships among variables.
There are several approaches to carry out the cointe-
gration test. The most commonly used methods are
two-step residual-based procedure (Engle & Granger,
1987) and the system-based reduced rank regression
approach (Johansen, 1991). These testing procedures
require that all variables to be integrated are of order
1. Since this is not valid for our variables, we use an

autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) procedure
developed by Pesaran and Shin (1999) and Pesaran et
al. (2001). The main advantage of the ARDL procedure
is that it tests the existence of cointegrating relationship
when variables are of a different order of integration
through the bound testing approach.
The ARDL framework for a four variable model
can be expressed as follows:

The variables with differences represent short-term
relationships whereas the variables with one period lag
represent long-term relationships. The ARDL method
estimates (p+1)k regressions to find out optimum lag (of
differences) for each variable, where p is the maximum
number of lags and k is the number of regressors in
the equation. The optimal model can be determined
using the model selection criteria such as the AIC and
Schwarz-Bayesian Criterion (SBC). The null hypothesis
of the cointegration test is that all estimated coefficients
of lagged level variables are equal to zero, that is, there is
no long-run relationship. In case of the above four-var-
iable model, the null hypothesis is l

=0. If the
calculated F-statistic exceeds the upper bound of the
critical value reported in Pesaran and Pesaran (1997),
the null hypothesis of no long-run relationship can be
rejected irrespective of the order of integration. On the
other hand, if the test statistic is less than the lower
bound of the critical value, the null hypothesis cannot
be rejected. However, if the test statistic falls between
the upper and lower critical values, no clear conclu-
sion can be drawn. The diagnostic (serial correlation,
normality, functional form, heteroscedasticity) and
stability (the cumulative sum of recursive residuals, the
cumulative sum of squares of recursive residuals) tests
are conducted to ascertain the appropriateness of the
ARDL model.
DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
The next step is to test whether there is a long-run rela-
tionship between the variables. Table 4 presents coin-
tegration test results for our baseline specification.
Column 4.1 of Table 4 reports the cointegration result
between private investment, public investment, bank
credit, the relative price of investment, and DUM.
Columns 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 add real lending rate, real
deposit rate and growth rate, respectively, and report
the respective cointegration test results. Across all
specifications, the calculated F-statistics exceed the
upper bound critical values implying that there exists a
long-run relationship between private investment and
the explanatory variables in all specifications.

The next step is to estimate the long-run estimates for
private investment function. The lags in the models are
selected on the basis of SBC. The long-run and short-run
estimation results are reported in Tables 5 and 6, respec-
tively. Table 5 represents our baseline specification for
the rest of the analysis. It is observed that across all
specifications in Table 5, private investment is posi-
tively and significantly related to bank credit, the rela-
tive price of investment, and real deposit rate, whereas
it is negatively and significantly related to public invest-
ment and real lending rate. The magnitude of the coef-
ficients varies depending on the specifications. The esti-
mates as reported in column 5.3 of Table 5 show that an
increase in public investment as a ratio of GDP by 1 per
cent leads to a decrease in private investment as a ratio
of GDP by 0.81 per cent after controlling for economic
conditions. It also affects private investment in the short
run. For instance, an increase in public investment by 1
per cent leads to a decrease in private investment by
0.53 per cent in the short run (see column 6.3 of Table
6). This implies crowding out of private investment in
response to an increase in public investment.

We also find that the coefficient of the endogenous
structural dummy variable (DUM) is positive and
statistically significant. This suggests that there was
an increase in private investment in 1995­96 due to the
various reform measures undertaken with regard to
trade and foreign direct investment. For example, total
approvals of FDI increased from $4.3 billion in 1994­95
to $11.2 billion in 1995­96. The import duties on capital
goods were reduced from 38 per cent in 1994­95 to
29 per cent in 1995­96, respectively (Ahluwalia, n.d.).
These reform measures had a positive shock on private
investment in India.
The coefficients of error correction term (ECM
t-1
) are
found to be large in magnitude and are statistically
significant (Table 6). For instance, the coefficient of
ECM
t-1
ranges between 0.49 and 0.65 across all speci-
fications. This implies that around 49 to 65 per cent of
the disequilibrium (deviation of private investment
from their respective equilibrium level) of the previous
year's shock gets corrected this year. This suggests
that the disequilibrium in private investment func-
tion occurring due to various shocks gets adjusted
completely between 2.5 and 3 years.
Furthermore, it is required that diagnostic statistics
provide support for our chosen specifications. Table 5
reports the diagnostic test statistics of ARDL models.
The high values of R2 for all the specifications show that
the goodness of fit is satisfactory. The F- statistics which
measures the joint significance of all regressors in the
specifications are also significant at 0.01 level of signifi-
cance. The Durbin-Watson statistics are also close to 2.
The diagnostic test statistics also show that all the spec-
ifications pass the tests for serial correlation, functional
form, normality, and heteroscedasticity.
We also test whether our baseline specification in column
5.3 of Table 5 is driven by reverse causality and is biasing
our results. In order to address the endogeneity bias, we
use each of the right hand side variables in column 5.3
of Table 5 as alternative dependent variables and test
whether there exists a cointegrating relationship between
the variables. The calculated F-statistics are equal to 2.70,
2.38, 1.90, 1.95 and 2.99 for public investment, real lending
rate, bank credit, the relative price of investment, and real
deposit rate, respectively (detailed results are not reported
here for the sake of brevity). The relevant upper bound
critical value at 5 per cent level of significance is 3.64

(Pesaran & Pesaran, 1997, Table F, Case-II, p. 478). As
the calculated F-statistic is less than the critical value,
no evidence of cointegration is found when alternative
dependent variables are considered. Hence, the right
hand side variables in column 5.3 of Table 5 can be treated
as long-run forcing variables for the explanation of private
investment and reverse causation is absent.
The plot of the cumulative sum (CUSUM) and the cumu-
lative sum of squares (CUSUMSQ) of recursive residuals
from our baseline specification against the critical bound
of the 5 per cent level of significance show that the spec-
ification is stable over time (see Appendix 2).
Additional Control Variables and Alternative
Sample Period
We perform several checks on the robustness of our
results. We start by examining whether the crowding out
effect is driven by the central government balance as a
share of GDP. Fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP could
be an important variable and could affect the private
investment. This is because an increase in fiscal deficit
may lead to a decrease in private investment on account
of an increase in interest rate or a decrease in availability
of loanable funds. Column 7.1 of Table 7 shows that the
coefficient of fiscal deficit has the correct (negative) sign
but it is insignificant. Hence, the crowding out of private
investment is not driven by fiscal deficit.
Next, we examine whether the crowding out effect is
driven by government final consumption expenditure.
The inclusion of this variable allows us to disentangle
whether public fixed investment or other types of expend-
iture crowds out private investment. Column 7.2 of Table
7 reports that the government consumption expendi-
ture enters the regression with a positive sign but it is
insignificant. Moreover, our main finding is robust to the
inclusion of government consumption expenditure.
We also test whether the impact of public investment
depends on inadequate public infrastructure (or inade-
quate stock of public capital). Inadequate public infra-
structure hinders private investment, but at the same
time leads to an increase in public investment. If this is
so, then there is a possibility that the crowding out effect
might be driven by insufficient public infrastructure.
In order to test this, we included kilometres of roads
per capita in our baseline specification but no cointe-
gration relationship was found between the variables.
After excluding lending rate and DUM from the spec-
ification as they were insignificant, we found a cointe-
grating relationship between the remaining explana-
tory variables and private investment. The coefficient
of the roads per capita has positive signs in both long-
and short-run equations (see columns 7.3 and 8.3 of
Tables 7 and 8, respectively), but it is significant only
in the short run. This suggests that public investment
is complementary to private investment in India, but
there are distortions in the process of creation of stock
of public capital. This is similar to the findings reported
by a few previous studies (Blejer & Khan, 1984; Cavallo
& Daude, 2011). Blejer and Khan (1984) argued that
while public infrastructure investment was comple-
mentary to private investment, other types of public
investment caused crowding out of private investment.
The investment function reported in column 5.3 of
Table 5 was re-estimated for a shorter sample period
(1978­2013) and reported in columns 7.4 and 8.4 of
Tables 7 and 8, respectively. The results show that our
main results (column 5.3, Table 5) regarding the impact
of public investment on private investment remains
unchanged regardless of the sample period.

Interaction with Structural Characteristics
Having shown that public investment systematically
crowds out private investment, we now deepen our
analysis by incorporating various structural charac-
teristics into the investment function. The impact of
public investment on private investment may vary for
different political regimes, different level of economic
reforms, and different level of foreign direct investment
because of the possibility of an interaction between
public investment and these characteristics.
We first examine the differential effect of public invest-
ment on private investment by economic liberalization.
After the adoption of New Industrial Policy of 1991, the
Government of India removed the industrial licensing
requirement for various industrial sectors, reduced
the number of activities for public sector, and opened
up a large number of activities for foreign investors.
A number of financial sector reforms like deregulation
of interest rates, reduction of cash reserve ratio and
statutory liquidity ratio, and the introduction of various
financial instruments were also carried out. Such a
dramatic shift in policies is expected to have relaxed
financing constraints and might have dampened the
crowding out effect of public investment. To examine
the impact of liberalization on crowding out effect, we
include both reform dummy variable and its interac-
tion with the public investment. Reform dummy takes
the value of 1 for the period from 1992 to 2013 and 0
otherwise. The interaction term captures the differ-
ential effect of economic reform on the magnitude of
coefficient of public investment. Column 10.1 of Table
10 shows that coefficient of the interaction term is posi-
tive and significant. This suggests that the crowding
out effect of public investment on private investment
was dampened during the post-reform period.
We now examine whether the political platform of the
incumbent government affects the crowding out effect
of public investment on private investment. If the
incumbent government is market-friendly, it may lessen
the crowding out effect. In order to test this hypothesis,
we adopt the political platform classification by the
World Bank Database of Political Institutions (Beck,
Clarke, Groff, Keefer, & Walsh, 2001). If the incumbent
government is classified as market-friendly, the dummy
variabletakesthevalueof1and0otherwise.Column10.2
of Table 10 shows that the coefficient of the interaction
term between public investment and market-friendly
dummy is large, positive, and significant. It is found
that a 1 per cent increase in public investment as ratio
of GDP leads to 2.50 per cent increase in private invest-
ment as a ratio of GDP when the incumbent govern-
ment is market-friendly. This implies that the public
investment crowds in private investment, if the govern-
ment is market-friendly.

We also examine whether net inflows of foreign
direct investment reduces the crowding out effect.
Theoretically, it is expected that an increase in net
inflows of foreign direct investment leads to an
increase in loanable funds in the domestic financial
market and relaxes the domestic financing constraint.
Hence, it is expected that it would dampen the
crowding out effect of public investment. Column 10.3
of Table 10 shows that the coefficient of the interac-
tion term between public investment and net inflows
of foreign direct investment is positive and signifi-
cant. This implies that an increase in net inflows of
foreign direct investment dampens the crowding
out effect of public investment. Table 11 reports the
short-run estimation results and are found to be
similar to long-run results.

Alternative Possible Explanations
In this section, we examine whether other potential
channels may contribute to the crowding out results.
First, political uncertainty (i.e. situation in which inves-
tors are unsure about which party will win election
and form the government) may affect private invest-
ment negatively. This is because political uncertainty
leads to policy uncertainty as each political party has its
own policy preference regarding industry regulation,
taxation, and so on. As a result, rational firms prefer
delaying investment until the political uncertainty
is resolved. Hence, political uncertainty may reduce
private investment. Julio and Yook (2012) examined
the impact of fluctuations in political uncertainty in
corporate investment in 48 countries between 1980 and
2005 in the context of national elections and found that
political uncertainty leads to a reduction on investment
Table 11 continued
expenditure by an average of 4.8 per cent in the election
years relative to the non-election years. This suggests
that uncertainty associated with changes in national
leadership causes firms to reduce investment rate.
Julio and Yook (2012) used the timing of election
as a measure of political uncertainty. It is based on
the assumption that political uncertainty is usually
higher during election time as compared to other time
periods. Empirical evidence suggests that uncertainty
related to political changes is reflected in asset prices.
For instance, it is found that stock market volatility
is significantly higher during an election period than
during non-election periods (Bialkowski, Gottschalk,
& Wisniewski 2008; Boutchkova, Doshi, Durnev, &
Molchanov, 2011). Similarly, Bernhard and Leblang
(2006) found several changes in exchange rates,
bond yields, and equity prices during elections. This
evidence supports that political uncertainty is more
than normal during election years.
We also investigate whether the crowding out effects are
driven by the political uncertainty. In order to capture
and to isolate the impact of political uncertainty, we use
election dummy variable. Election dummy takes the
value of 1 both in pre-election year and election year
and 0 otherwise. It is expected that election dummy
would have a negative sign. Column 13.1 of Table 13
reports that the coefficient of election dummy has posi-
tive sign but it is insignificant. This suggests that the
crowding out effect of public investment is not driven
by the political uncertainty hypothesis.

Another factor, which may contribute to crowding
out effect of public investment on private invest-
ment, is the political business cycle. As per the polit-
ical business cycle theory, politicians successfully
manipulate fiscal and monetary policy instruments
to influence macroeconomic performance prior to
an election to enhance their chances of re-election
(Nordhaus, 1975). The basic idea behind the theory
is that voters make their decisions on the basis of the
state of the economy at the time of election. Therefore,
politicians use expansionary monetary and fiscal
policies to exploit the short-run trade-off between
inflation and growth. An expansionary monetary
policy is expected to increase private investment and
an expansionary fiscal policy is expected to crowd
out private investment.
We test if political business cycle contributes to this
crowding out of private investment. We adopt the
approach of Julio and Yook (2012) to test the political
business cycle theory and estimate the following speci-
fication using data from 1970­71 to 2012­13:
Y

Table 14 continued
where, Y
t
is the macroeconomic policy variable, GR is
the growth rate of real GDPin the year t, and ELECTION
is a dummy variable that takes the value equal to 1 in
the election year and pre-election year. Following Julio
and Yook (2012), we examine four different macro-eco-
nomic variables such as the growth rate of government
expenditure, growth rate in money supply (M3), real
lending rate, and inflation rate.
Table 15 represents the results of political business cycle
regressions. Pre-electoral manipulation does not have
a significant impact on the growth rate of government
expenditure, growth in money supply, interest rate or
inflation rate in the pre-election period. Besides this, as
an alternative test, we also include growth in govern-
ment spending, growth in money supply, inflation rate in
our private investment function. The long-run results are
shown in columns 13.2 to 13.4 of Table 13 and short-run
results are shown in columns 14.2 to 14.4 of Table 14. The
real lending rate has already been included in all equa-
tions. But the coefficient of public investment is still nega-
tive and is of similar magnitude after including these vari-
ables. This implies that the opportunistic behaviour of
politicians is not driving our crowding out results.

CONCLUSIONS
This study attempts to find out whether public invest-
ment crowded out private investment in India during
1970­2013 using ARDL procedure developed by
Pesaran and Shin (1999) and Pesaran et al. (2001) in the
presence of endogenous structural break. The results
of this study reveal that public investment crowds out
private investment. Our base line results imply that a
1 per cent increase in public investment as a ratio of
GDP leads to 0.81 per cent and 0.53 per cent decrease in
private investment as a ratio of GDP in the long run and
short run, respectively, after controlling for economic
Table 15 continued
conditions. Moreover, a "market friendly" incumbency
is found to dampen the magnitude of the crowding out
effect of public investment. The results also reveal that
an increase in the ratio of foreign direct investment to
GDP offsets the magnitude of the crowding out effect of
public investment on private investment.
Further, public infrastructure (represented by the
kilometres of roads per capita) is found to have a
positive effect on private investment in the short
run. However, this complementarity may disappear
if public investment projects are not of good quality
and/or financing of these public projects have an
adverse effect on the availability of bank credit or
lending rate. Also, not all types of public investment
have the same positive effect. Public investment
should in fact be focused more on goods and services
which are non-rival and non-excludable in nature
with significant positive externalities.
It is important to note that we included a single endog-
enously determined structural break in our model,
excluding the possibility of multiple breaks. There is a
scope to increase multiple structural breaks in the anal-
ysis and re-investigate the impact of public investment
on private investment in India in future studies.

NOTE
1 Here, long run is a period during which actual private
investment is equal to equilibrium private investment
(i.e. the predicted private investment from the cointe-
grating regression) and short run is a period during
which actual private investment deviates (either above
or below) from the equilibrium private investment
Appendix 1 continued

due to various shocks and unexpected changes (For a
detailed discussion, see Enders, 1995, p. 366). The time
span that distinguishes long run from short run can
be calculated from the speed of adjustment which can
vary across markets. It is argued that "how long is the
long run depends on the speed of adjustment of the
particular markets considered... the analysis of short-run
dynamics is very important because that is where we
get estimates of speeds of adjustment. For financial
markets with rapid speed of adjustment, the long run
is indeed short" (Madala & Kim, 1998, p. 236). The
estimate of the speed of adjustment in our investment
function varies between 0.49 and 0.65 across all specifi-
cations (discussed later). This implies that around 49 to
65 per cent of the disequilibrium of the previous year's
shock--called the equilibrium error--gets corrected in
the current year. Hence, the entire disequilibrium/devi-
ation gets adjusted completely between two and three
years and the actual private investment returns to equi-
librium private investment. Therefore, short run can be
thought of as around two to three years and the long run
can be thought of as around four to five years.
