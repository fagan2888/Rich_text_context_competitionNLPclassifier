OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence, genotypes, and
individual-level correlates of high-risk human papilloma-
virus (HPV) among women aged 57­85.
METHODS: Community-residing women (N1,550),
aged 57­85, were drawn from a nationally representative
probability sample. In-home interviews and biomea-
sures, including a self-collected vaginal specimen, were
obtained between 2005 and 2006. Specimens were ana-
lyzed for high-risk HPV DNA using Hybrid Capture 2; of
1,028 specimens provided, 1,010 were adequate for anal-
ysis. All samples testing positive were analyzed for HPV
DNA by L1 consensus polymerase chain reaction fol-
lowed by type-specific hybridization.
RESULTS: The overall population-based weighted esti-
mate of high-risk HPV prevalence by Hybrid Capture 2
(Digene Corp.) was 6.0% (95% confidence interval 4.5­
7.9). Current marital and smoking status, frequency of
sexual activity, history of cancer, and hysterectomy were
associated with high-risk HPV positivity. Among high-risk
HPV­positive women, 63% had multiple type infections.
Human papillomavirus-16 or -18 was present in 17.4% of
all high-risk HPV­positive women. The most common
high-risk genotypes among high-risk HPV­positive women
were HPV-61 (19.1%), -31 (13.1%), -52 (12.9%), -58 (12.5%),
-83 (12.3%), -66 (12.0%), -51 (11.7%), -45 (11.2%), -56
(10.3%), -53 (10.2%), -16 (9.7%), and -62 (9.2%). Being
married and having an intact uterus were independently
associated with lower prevalence of high-risk HPV. Among
unmarried women, current sexual activity and smoking
were independently and positively associated with high-risk
HPV infection.
CONCLUSION: In this nationally representative popula-
tion, nearly 1 in 16 women aged 57­85 was found to have
high-risk HPV, and prevalence was stable across older
age groups.

LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II
Nearly all cases of cervical intraepithelial neopla-
sia and cancer are attributable to sexually trans-
mitted genital tract infection with one or more of
approximately 15 oncogenic, or high-risk, types of
human papillomavirus (HPV).1,2 In the United States,
20% of cervical-cancer cases, but 36% of cervical-
cancer deaths, occur in women age 65 and older.3
Annual direct medical costs for preventing and treat-
ing HPV-related anogenital disease across the whole
U.S. population are estimated to exceed $4 billion;
morbidity and cost among older women have not
been quantified.4
The natural history of genital-tract HPV in older
women is poorly understood. A bimodal age distribu-
tion in HPV prevalence has been observed in some
populations.5­8 The second peak in HPV prevalence

in older women, where observed, is thought to result
primarily from persistent infection.9 High-risk types
may be more likely than low-risk types to persist.10,11
Susceptibility to and failure to clear genital HPV
infection may be affected by immune function, sex-
hormone status, or vaginal epithelial function.9
Women age 65 and older will comprise 14.8% of
the U.S. population by 2010 and 21.7% by 2030.12
Many older women are sexually active13 and engage
in other behaviors, such as smoking,14 that are known
risk factors for genital-tract HPV in younger women.
Older women initiating new sexual relationships in
later life may be exposed to HPV strains for the first
time.15 Substantially more women are aging with the
uterus intact16 and, therefore, remain vulnerable to
cervical HPV disease and Pap test abnormalities.
Public health messages and commercial advertising
about cervical cancer screening, genital HPV, and the
HPV vaccine reach women (and men) of all ages and
generate public concern about vulnerability to infec-
tion, transmission, and sequelae.17 The age-group­
specific population prevalence of high-risk HPV
among older women in the United States and its
consequences for older women's health are unknown.
This study aims to extend recent HPV-prevalence
data18 by estimating the prevalence, genotypes, and
individual-level correlates of high-risk HPV among
women age 57­85.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A nationally representative probability sample of
community-dwelling adults aged 57­85 was gener-
ated from U.S. households screened in 2004 for the
Health and Retirement Study, which was seeking
participants age 56 and younger. Of 4,017 eligible
participants, 3,005 (1,455 men, 1,550 women) were
interviewed between July 2005 and March 2006,
yielding a weighted response rate of 75.5% (un-
weighted 74.8%). In-home interviews conducted by
trained female field staff (unless the respondent re-
quested a man) included an interviewer-administered,
standardized, computer-assisted questionnaire and bi-
ological measures. A detailed description of the Na-
tional Social Life, Health and Aging Project study
population and study design has been published
previously.13
All women selected for participation in the Na-
tional Social Life, Health and Aging Project were
eligible for this study. Of 1,550 eligible women, 1,028
(66.3% unweighted, 67.5% weighted) agreed to sub-
mit a self-administered vaginal swab specimen (Fig. 1).
Of these, nine respondents tried but were unable to
collect the vaginal swab, equipment problems oc-
curred in the collection of six swabs, two specimens
were lost in transit, and one specimen was missing in
error. Thus, 1,010 (98.0%, 66.2% overall, weighted)
specimens were adequate for analysis.
Nonresponders to the vaginal swab protocol were
significantly more likely than responders to be older
(older than 75 years), have less than a high school
education (Table 1), and were less likely to report a
recent pelvic examination, menopausal prescription
hormone use, or frequent sexual activity in the previ-
ous year. A physical or health problem was the most
common recorded reason for not submitting a vaginal
specimen. The protocol was approved by the University
of Chicago and the NORC Institutional Review Boards;
all respondents gave written informed consent.
Race and ethnicity were self-reported. Sex was
defined as "any mutually voluntary activity with
another person that involves sexual contact, whether
or not intercourse or orgasm occurs." For those
reporting a current (prior 12 months) sexual partner,
sexual frequency, condom use, and partner's sex were
collected for up to the two most recent partners.
Partner infidelity (known or perceived) was collected
for up to the two most recent partners for a randomly
selected two thirds of survey respondents. Questions
about sexual activity were refused by 2­7% of respon-
dents. Data regarding the most recent sexual partner
are used in the analyses reported here.
Smoking was assessed using questions adapted
from a major epidemiologic study of aging.19 Physical
health was self-rated using the standard 5-point scale,
and comorbidities were assessed using a modified
Charlson Index.20 Current medications were logged
and classified according to the Multum Drug Data-
base: Lexicon Plus version (Cerner Multum, Denver,
CO).21 Other health and health-behavior variables
were obtained by self-report.
Women were given an illustrated instruction
card with collection materials22 and directed to a
bathroom or other private room. The swab for HPV
testing was secured inside a labeled tube containing 1
mL Specimen Transport Medium (Digene Corp.,
Gaithersburg, MD). Tubes were stored on wet ice
until day's end and shipped overnight on cold packs
to the University of Pittsburgh, Magee-Women's Hos-
pital Department of Pathology clinical microbiology
laboratory of J.A.J.
High-risk HPV­DNA testing was performed using
the Hybrid Capture 2 High-Risk HPV DNA TestTM
(Catalog No. 5199-1220; Digene Corp.) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. The high-risk Hybrid Capture
2 signal amplification assay contains a cocktail of probes
980 Lindau et al HPV in Older Women OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
complementary to 13 high-risk HPV types (HPV-16,
-18, -31, -33, -35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -56, -58, -59, and -68).
In addition to the kit controls, an external sample-
processing control for adequate cells lysis (HeLa cells,
which contain integrated HPV-18 DNA) was processed
with each batch of specimens. Specimens with relative
light unit/cutoff values of 1.0 or more, obtained using
the Digene Microplate Luminometer 2000 Instrument
(Digene Corp.), were considered positive for high-risk
HPV DNA.
Genotyping was performed on 56 Hybrid Cap-
ture 2 high-risk HPV­positive specimens (Fig. 1)
using the Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test (re-
search use only) and Linear Array Detection Kit
(Roche Molecular Systems Inc., Pleasanton, CA).
Only Hybrid Capture 2 high-risk HPV­positive spec-
imens were genotyped for this study. The denatured
specimens were stored at 20°C before being
thawed, neutralized, and genotyped. For compatibility
with the QIAamp® MinElute Media Kit protocol for
DNA extraction (Cat. No. 57704, QIAGEN, Valencia,
CA), 250 microliters of each denatured Specimen
Transport Medium (Digene Corp.) was re-acidified to a
pH just below 7.0 and the entire volume extracted. Fifty
microliters of the final 120 microliters extract volume
were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a
master mix containing hot-start Taq polymerase and
biotin-labeled PGMY09/11 primer set to amplify 37
different anogenital HPV genotypes (450 base pair
target) along with a primer set to human -globin (268
base pair target), which served as an internal control for
DNA amplification. Thermocycling was performed us-
ing the Gold-plated 96-Well GeneAmp PCR System
9700 (part no. 4314878; Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA) thermocycler. Amplicon denaturation and
detection was carried out using the Linear Array Detec-

tion Kit (Roche Molecular Systems Inc.). For each
specimen to be considered valid, both the high- and
low-level -globin controls had to yield a visible band
on the blot. For each run to be considered valid, both
positive and negative controls had to perform as ex-
pected. The ambiguous XR/52 probe data were han-
dled as follows: HPV type 52 was considered positive
only when the HPV GT52/33/35/58 band alone was
visible. Although coinfection with HPV type 52 cannot
be ruled out in cases where both the HPV GT52/33/
35/58 band and one or more of the individual GT33,
GT35, and/or GT58 bands were visible, we interpreted
those specimens as negative for HPV type 52. To ensure
reproducibility, 22 of the 56 specimens were randomly
selected and retested. Without exception, the number of
bands and their relative staining intensities were similar
between runs.
The analytic sample consisted of 1,010 respond-
ers who provided an adequate vaginal self-swab spec-
imen. High-risk HPV prevalence (at least one high-
risk genotype present by Hybrid Capture 2) was
estimated with 95% confidence interval (CI) obtained
using a logit transform to ensure that the confidence
limit would fall between 0 and 1. Logistic regression
was used to model associations between high-risk
HPV and individual factors. All analyses accounted
for the survey sampling design through incorporation
of sampling strata and clusters as well as weights that
adjusted for differential probability of selection and
differential nonresponse. Standard errors were
computed using the Taylor linearization method.23
Estimates in tables are marked if the variance
estimate is based on fewer than 12 strata with
observations in both primary sampling units, fol-
lowing guidelines for the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey.24 Results were not
adjusted for multiple testing. A sensitivity analysis
was conducted in which all analyses were repeated,
with missing high-risk HPV values recoded as
high-risk HPV­negative (n539, Fig. 1). Analyses
were conducted using Stata Statistical Software 10
(StataCorp, College Station, TX).

Before analysis, independent variables measured
on a continuous scale or as counts were categorized
because of linearity assumptions underlying the use of
continuous covariates. Lifetime number of sex part-
ners was categorized as zero, one, or two or more.
Age was categorized as 57­64, 65­74, and 75­85
years for consistency with previous studies25 and the
age structure of the National Social Life, Health and
Aging Project sample. Duration since last menstrual
period was broken into decades, and then decades
were collapsed as indicated by model fit using the
criteria described below. Categories were collapsed
before analysis if necessary to obtain adequate num-
bers of observations and cases within each category.
During analysis, categories that did not differ signifi-
cantly and had similar odds ratios (ORs) were col-
lapsed, provided that the collapsed categories were
clinically meaningful. Univariable results are reported
with minimal collapsing. Selected clinically relevant
interactions were tested: between married and each of
the sexual behavior variables (lifetime number of sex
partners, sex in the previous year, condom use) and
between duration since last menstrual period and
hysterectomy.
Multivariable logistic models were fit to identify
independent correlates of high-risk HPV. Terms con-
sidered for inclusion were the significant interaction
of marital status (married compared with not married)
and sex in the previous year, factors significant at
P.20 in univariable analysis, and potential confound-
ers (age, lifetime number of sex partners). Model selec-
tion was conducted using a stepwise approach, keeping
within the limitations of the number of high-risk HPV
cases.26 Terms were retained if significant at P.05 or if
they modified the effect of a significant covariate. Mul-
tivariable analysis was conducted for the entire sample
and for women not currently married; multivariable
analysis among married women was precluded by the
small number of high-risk HPV cases (n19).
RESULTS
The mean age of respondents was 68 years, mean age
at menopause was 46 years, mean duration since
menopause was 22 years, mean lifetime number of
sex partners was 4.5 (median 2.0), and mean number
of pregnancies was 2.8. The population prevalence of
high-risk HPV was estimated to be 6.0% (95% CI 4.5­
7.9). This corresponds to 1.8 (95% CI 1.4­2.4) million
women aged 57­85 with prevalent high-risk HPV
infection, using 2006 Census estimates.27
High-risk HPV prevalence was estimated accord-
ing to sociodemographic characteristics (Table 2).
Prevalence of high-risk HPV infection did not differ
significantly by age group, race/ethnicity, education,
or insurance status. Current marital status was a
strong, significant predictor of high-risk HPV infec-
tion. Prevalence was lowest among those currently
married and was highest among those who were
divorced.
The frequencies of HPV genotypes were deter-
mined for 56 of the 64 high-risk Hybrid Capture
2-positive specimens (Fig. 1). Figure 2 illustrates their
distribution (2A) and copresence (2B). One or more of
the four genotypes included in the quadrivalent HPV
vaccine, -6, -11, -16, -18 was detected in 27.2% of
women with high-risk HPV, although zero cases of
HPV-11 were found. Nearly two thirds (63%) of
women with high-risk HPV had multiple types de-
tected. Among 49 specimens with any high-risk HPV
genotype detected, 37 contained two or more geno-
types. The most common high-risk genotypes found
among high-risk HPV­positive women were HPV-61
(19.1%), -31 (13.1%), -52 (12.9%), -58 (12.5%), -83
(12.3%), -66 (12.0%), -51 (11.7%), -45 (11.2%), -56
(10.3%), -53 (10.2%), -16 (9.7%), and -62 (9.2%). No
specimens tested positive for both high-risk HPV-16
and -18; HPV-16 or -18 was present in 17.4% of all
high-risk HPV­positive women. These genotype
prevalences may be underestimates of the preva-
lences in the entire population because genotyping
was limited to women who first tested positive for
high-risk HPV by Hybrid Capture 2.
Behavioral and health factors significantly associ-
ated with higher high-risk HPV prevalence in bivari-
ate analyses included current smoking, cancer, and
hysterectomy. Although data on prior chemotherapy
use were unavailable, 47 women (4.6% of high-risk
HPV­negative and 12.6% of high-risk HPV­positive)
were currently using an antineoplastic agent. High-
risk HPV was positively associated with current che-
motherapy use (OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.17­7.68, P.02).
High-risk HPV prevalence also was associated with
sex in the prior 12 months, but the nature of the
association differed between married and unmarried
women (Table 3).
High-risk HPV prevalence was significantly
higher among women who reported two or more
sexual partners over their lifetime compared with
those who reported one or none (OR 2.54, 95% CI
1.07­6.02, P.04). Only three women (one Hybrid
Capture 2-negative, two Hybrid Capture 2-positive)
reported having more than one current sexual part-
ner. Very few women reported condom use: 1.5%
(95% CI 0.9­2.6) overall and 3.4% (95% CI 1.96­
5.98) of sexually active women. Likewise, very few
women reported ever being diagnosed with cervical
VOL. 112, NO. 5, NOVEMBER 2008 Lindau et al HPV in Older Women 983
cancer (1.4%, 95% CI 0.7­2.7), a sexually transmitted
infection (STI) other than HPV (11%, 95% CI 9.1­
13.9), or genital warts (2%, 95% CI 1.0­3.6). High-risk
HPV was detected in 4.4% of women who reported
never having had sex.
High-risk HPV prevalence was significantly asso-
ciated with having had sex in the prior 12 months
only among unmarried (including formerly married)
women (Table 3), corresponding to a significant in-
teraction of marital status with sex in this time period
(P.03). Among married women, high-risk HPV
prevalence did not differ significantly between no sex
and infrequent sex in the prior 12 months, whereas
more frequent sex (more than once a month) was
significantly associated with a decreased prevalence
of high-risk HPV (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03­0.45,
P.002). Spousal infidelity was reported by 5.9% of
married women and was significantly associated with
having high-risk HPV (OR 5.39, 95% CI 1.43­20.4,
P.01). Too few cases of HPV (n12) occurred
among unmarried women who reported sex within
the previous year to further evaluate the effect of
frequency of sex in this subgroup. Owing to hetero-
geneity and sparse data on the timing and nature of
the relationship with the most recent sexual partner
among unmarried women, the effects of partner infi-
delity in this subgroup were not explored.
The prevalence of hysterectomy, which was
significantly associated with higher high-risk HPV
prevalence, was 46% (95% CI 41.9­49.2). Women
who had a hysterectomy did not differ from those
who did not with respect to sexual behavior, current
smoking, demographic characteristics, history of cer-
vical dysplasia, or number of pregnancies. Hysterec-
tomy was significantly associated with poorer self-
rated health (very poor, poor compared with higher

rating: OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.18­2.52). Among
women reporting premenopausal hysterectomy,
high-risk HPV prevalence did not differ between
those with bilateral oophorectomy and those with
at least one remaining ovary (P.46). Among
women who did not have a hysterectomy, the
likelihood of high-risk HPV presence was signifi-
cantly higher if more than 20 years had elapsed
since the last menstrual period (age-adjusted OR
9.25, 95% CI 2.63­32.5, P.001).
In multivariable analysis, marital status and hys-
terectomy were independent correlates of high-risk
HPV detection, adjusted for age (Table 4). Among
unmarried women, higher high-risk HPV prevalence
was independently associated with sex in the prior 12
months and current smoking, adjusted for age and
lifetime number of sex partners. Although the num-
ber of cases of high-risk HPV among married women
was too small to conduct a full multivariable analysis,
the association of more frequent sex with lower
high-risk HPV remained after adjustment for age and
lifetime number of sex partners.
In the sensitivity analysis, in which 539 missing
high-risk HPV values were recoded as high-risk
HPV­negative, the overall prevalence of high-risk
HPV was 4.0% (95% CI 3.0­5.2). The associations
between high-risk HPV and respondent characteris-
tics were similar.

DISCUSSION
Prevalence of high-risk HPV DNA in a representative
sample of U.S. women aged 57­85 was 6.0%, corre-
sponding with 1.8 (95% CI 1.4 to 2.4) million women,
and was stable across older age subgroups. Risk
factors in younger women are also significant corre-
lates of high-risk HPV presence in older women.
Only about one in 30 sexually active older women
uses condoms. Additional health-related correlates of
high-risk HPV positivity, not appreciated in younger
populations, are identified. Among older women with
genital high-risk HPV, the vast majority exhibit mul-
tiple genotype infection.
Estimated high-risk HPV prevalence for women
aged 57­85 is nearly identical to that reported by the
U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey for women aged 50­59, using comparable meth-
ods.18 In a validation study including older women,
high agreement was found (88.1%, 0.73) be-
tween physician and self-swab specimens for detect-
ing HPV.28 The frequency of oncogenic HPV types
16 and 18 translates roughly to minimum population
prevalences of 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively; no indi-
vidual tested positive for both HPV types 16 and 18.
These findings are very similar to the U.S. National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey prevalence
estimates for these genotypes among females age
14­59, including the rare copresence of types 16 and
18 (0.1%).18
Other U.S.-based studies of HPV that include
older women are limited by relatively small, clinical
convenience samples and aggregation of women age
60 and older. Age-standardized estimates of high-risk
HPV in 1,154 female patients age 16 and older
between 1989 and 1990 were 4.2­4.9% using a PCR
and DNA hybridization assay.29 A smaller study of
260 healthy, postmenopausal women seeking gyneco-
logic care during the period from 1997­1999 found
a high-risk HPV prevalence of 6%30 using similar
methods.
The frequency of multiple type infection found
here is significantly higher than that observed among
younger women with any genital HPV18 or high-risk
HPV specifically.31 This may reflect cumulative life-
time exposure,32 an association between multiple type

infection and vulnerability to persistence33 or reacti-
vation of latent infection,34 and/or a senescence-
related reduction in capacity to suppress dormant
virus or clear new infection.35 Longitudinal, popula-
tion-based data are needed to elucidate mechanisms
underlying the natural history of oncogenic HPV in
older women. The implications of long-term carriage
of genital tract HPV well beyond menopause are not
well understood; further work is needed to appreciate
the implications in older women for vulvovaginal
diseases, transmission to partners, Pap test abnormal-
ities, treatment decisions about gynecologic comor-
bidities, and psychological well-being.
The prevalence of high-risk HPV is higher in
hysterectomized compared with nonhysterectomized
women, despite similar sexual behavior. Understand-
ing the role of hysterectomy in the natural history of
high-risk HPV is complex, limited in this study by
self-report, and should incorporate factors such as
timing and type of hysterectomy, oophorectomy,
indication for hysterectomy, and adjunctive treat-
ment. In two studies, Castle et al documented high-
risk HPV in younger women who had undergone
hysterectomy but found no difference in HPV prev-
alence by hysterectomy status.29,36 One study suggests
that persistent genital tract HPV infection in older
women may be a marker of immune compromise.35
This may partially explain the relationship we find
between hysterectomy and high-risk HPV. We found
that a history of any cancer, a higher number of
cancers, and any current antineoplastic agent use
were associated with a higher prevalence of high-risk
HPV and that women with hysterectomy were less
healthy than women who did not have hysterectomy.
There were limitations to our study. Cervical
dysplasia and sexually transmitted infection history
are likely underreported,37 thereby attenuating ex-
pected associations with HPV. Sexuality data also
were self-reported; prior work with this data set
demonstrates high internal and external validity and
low item nonresponse using valid interview meth-
ods.13,38 Differences between vaginal swab nonre-
sponders and responders could bias prevalence esti-
mates; however, in the extreme case where all
nonresponders are assumed to be high-risk HPV
negative, overall prevalence is still 4.0% (2.9% in the
women aged 75­85) and the same correlates are
identified. In some subgroups, the very small number
of participants with high-risk HPV results in wide CIs,
which have been reported for completeness but
should be regarded with caution. Use of the self-
collected specimens may lead to detection of different
HPV types than those collected by direct endocervi-
cal sampling and may favor detection of low-risk
types with predilection for the vagina.18,28 The degree
of vaginal atrophy also may influence HPV detec-
tion,25 as suggested in our study by a higher rate of
detection in women with a longer duration since last
menses. Also, collecting a vaginal specimen from a
single time point does not distinguish between new,
persistent, or reactivated latent infection. Further-
more, because the Hybrid Capture 2 assay does not
control for cellular adequacy, a small but unknown
proportion may have been falsely negative.
High-risk HPV prevalence was stable across
older age groups and nearly equivalent to that esti-
mated by the U.S. National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey for women in the sixth decade.
Among older women with high-risk HPV positivity,
the proportion of HPV types targeted by the HPV
vaccine was 27.2% (95% CI 14.4­36.9), comparable
with 1.2% (95% CI 0.8­2.0) prevalence. Although an
underestimate of the prevalence of vaccine types
among all older women, this is in contrast to the
estimated 3.4% prevalence among the general popu-
lation of females age 14­59.18 These data provide
physicians and the public new information pertinent
to HPV counseling, screening decisions, and health-
related quality of life.39
