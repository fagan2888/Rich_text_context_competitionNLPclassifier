Article
Health care research agencies are emphasizing the impor-
tance of engaging the public in the development, implemen-
tation, and dissemination of research (Canadian Institutes of
Health Research [CIHR], 2010; Watt, Higgins, & Kendrick,
2000). This process is known as citizen engagement and is
integral to translating knowledge generated from research
into health care practice and policy (Boote, 2011; CIHR,
2010). CIHR use the term citizens to refer to any individuals
who are stakeholders in research, including patients, caregiv-
ers, advocacy groups, members of the general public, health
care professionals, and other service providers.
At citizen engagement events, researchers and citizens
come together to discuss, deliberate, and make decisions
regarding research processes. This type of collaboration
helps to ensure the outcomes of research will be relevant,
widely disseminated, and readily implemented into policy
and practice (CIHR, 2010). Through citizen engagement,
stakeholders may have a sense of ownership in research.
Also, research organizations may be better able to dedicate
resources to priority areas identified by stakeholders (CIHR,
2010; Watt et al., 2000).
Older adults (i.e., individuals older than 65 years) are the
fastest growing segment of the population in Canada and
many other countries of the world (United Nations, 2002). As
a result of this growth, age-associated health conditions that
require rehabilitation are also more prevalent. Thus, health
and rehabilitation research with older adults are receiving
increased attention (Chappell, McDonald, &Stones, 2008).
Citizen engagement can help with determining the direction
of research related to older adults. From 2004 to 2006, CIHR
engaged the public across Canada in discussions about direc-
tions for research for older adults during their Regional
Seniors'Workshops on Research. At these workshops, public
stakeholders were primarily older adults (65+ years). In their
summary document, CIHR reported the following topics as
priorities among participants: access to health services
(including rehabilitation), determinants of health related to
lifestyle, transportation and mobility issues, and knowledge
translation (KT) (CIHR Institute of Aging, 2007). The
reported interest of older adults in rehabilitation research
prompted an interdisciplinary group of researchers at
University of Alberta to develop a citizen engagement event
geared to stakeholders in Edmonton, Alberta.

Abstract
In this article, we describe a knowledge translation symposium focused on rehabilitation research for older adults. The
symposium consisted of presentations on rehabilitation research, followed by roundtable discussions designed to solicit
perspectives of public stakeholders. Eighty-eight people attended the event, most with backgrounds in health care service
provision. The participants evaluated the event and provided feedback on research topics related to rehabilitation of older
adults. Lessons learned from this event may be useful in the design of future knowledge translation symposia and to facilitate
involvement of public stakeholders in design, implementation, and dissemination of rehabilitation research for older adults.

and with whom, people live their lives. Functional abilities
determine the choices individuals have and the satisfaction
they take in daily life (Chappell & Cooke, 2010).
Rehabilitation disciplines, including occupational therapy,
physical therapy, speech­language pathology, and recre-
ational therapy, play key roles in the management of many
chronic conditions experienced by older adults. Clinical
research in rehabilitation of older adults is focused on func-
tional issues arising from a wide spectrum of biomechanical,
neurological, cognitive, and mental health conditions.
The findings of rehabilitation research can be used to sup-
port policy and guide practice such that interventions are evi-
dence based, effective, and fiscally efficient. However,
stakeholders (including older adults and professionals who
work with them) first need to become aware of research find-
ings and the role of researchers in knowledge creation. The
dissemination, exchange, and application of knowledge are
collectively referred to as KT (CIHR, 2013). To date, KT
research in rehabilitation is still sparse and largely unex-
plored (Jones, Roop, Pohar, Albrecht, & Scott, 2014; Menon,
Korner-Bitensky, Kastner, McKibbon, & Straus, 2009; Scott
et al., 2012). The traditional practice of KT involves research-
ers focusing their dissemination activities toward other
researchers and health care professionals through scholarly
publications and presentations. Ideally, researchers should
work toward KT models that involve a genuine collaborative
process founded on valuing exchange among a variety of
stakeholders through citizen engagement.
The primary purpose of this article is to describe the
implementation of a citizen engagement event, the
Knowledge Translation and Network Engagement (KTNE)
symposium. This symposium was carried out by a group of
researchers that comprise the Special Interest Group on
Aging at the University of Alberta. The secondary purpose of
this article is to present a summary of the participants' per-
spectives on rehabilitation research gleaned from roundtable
discussions and written feedback, as well as their opinions
on the process and content of the KTNE symposium.
The KTNE Symposium
The Special Interest Group on Aging (SIGA) in the Faculty
of Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Alberta
includes researchers from speech­language pathology, occu-
pational therapy, and physical therapy, whose area of research
specifically involves rehabilitation of older adults. The man-
date of this group of researchers is research collaboration
(i.e., "the working together of researchers to achieve the
common goal of producing new scientific knowledge"; Katz
& Martin, 1997, p. 7), trainee mentorship and consultation.
Members conduct research in areas such as arthritis, sleep,
pain, communication, swallowing, mental health, resiliency,
health-related quality of life, and the use of technology to
promote activities of daily living. Although diverse, these
research areas are linked by an overriding theme: protecting,
maintaining, and improving older adults' functional
abilities.
The KTNE symposium was focused on exchanging
knowledge and ideas related to rehabilitation research
involving older adults. The goals for the KTNE event were
as follows:
1. Disseminate information--provide evidence-based
information about recent advances in older adult
rehabilitation to citizen stakeholders;
2. Exchange ideas--enable citizens' access to informa-
tion that is relevant and applicable to functional abili-
ties and quality of life of older adults; solicit ideas
from stakeholders to guide researchers in developing
research hypotheses and objectives to meet the reha-
bilitation needs of older adults;
3. Develop collaborative partnerships--foster trust and
mutual respect between researchers and stakeholders
to ensure citizens will advise and collaborate to guide
future rehabilitation research projects; and
4. Gather feedback from participants--collect partici-
pant feedback about meaningfulness and usefulness
of the pilot activity to improve future KTNE events.
Symposium Format and Participants
The KTNE symposium was advertised to the public with the
title "Seniors' Rehabilitation: An Update on Research That
Matters to You." Researchers sent out notification of the
event via email to local organizations who serve older adults
and/or have connections such organizations. Ninety-one
individuals preregistered and provided information about
their backgrounds (see Table 1). The majority of the regis-
trants indicated that they were health care providers or other
service providers who worked with older adults. Eighty-
eight citizens attended the event (including 1 member of the
member of the general public). The event was held at a local
community center and there was no charge for attendance.
The symposium was approximately 3 hr in length.
Researchers began with six, 15-min presentations in which
Suleman et al. 3
they shared the scope and findings of recent research on
older adult rehabilitation. After the presentations, attendees
moved to round tables to work in groups of 8 to 10 people.
The group members discussed their views on research priori-
ties, as well as potential barriers and facilitators of rehabilita-
tion research with older adults, using guiding questions (see
Figure 1). Each group nominated a scribe who wrote
responses to the guiding questions. After answering each of
the guiding questions, each small group had a spokesperson
who shared their responses in a large group discussion. Each
group's written responses were collected at the end of the
symposium and then summarized according to guiding
question.
At the completion of the event, participants were asked to
complete individual rating forms related to the usefulness of
the KTNE symposium on a scale of 0 (of no use) to 10 (very
useful), and provide written feedback on the event.
Results
Participant Perspectives on Rehabilitation
Research
Priorities for rehabilitation research.Participant groups were
asked to create a list of important research topics relevant to
older adults and subsequently identify three priority areas
from the list they generated (Figure 1). Collectively, the
groups generated more than 20 areas of priority for research
including research related to specific populations of older
adults (i.e., Aboriginal people), diagnosis groups (e.g.,
stroke, dementia), and symptoms (e.g., independence, resil-
ience, quality of life, sleep, pain management and bariatric
care). Transportation and driving were also reported as top
priorities for research, as were health service issues such as
factors that would support patient adherence with treatment
programs, discharge planning, and falls prevention pro-
grams. Other categories of research priorities were as
follows:
·
· Seniors' social participation in leisure/community
activities (accessibility and engagement)
·
· Health management outcomes and measurement
·
· Building physical environments to meet seniors'
needs
·
· Nutrition/hydration issues
Barriers to rehabilitation research with older adults.Numerous
barriers related to the research process were identified,
including complexity of aging and research topics (i.e., one
participant wrote "It [aging] is a huge multifactorial area"),
the multidisciplinary nature of rehabilitation research in
older adults, and difficulty measuring outcomes. Others per-
ceived barriers were limited research funding for rehabilita-
tion research for older adults, lack of public interest to

support such research, and the perception that few research-
ers seemed interested in conducting studies with older adults.
Participants acknowledged that research with older adults
requires extensive investments of effort and time by research-
ers, administrative and clinical staff in health care, and com-
munity contexts. They highlighted a lack of time for
clinicians to partner in research; "How can clinicians partici-
pate in research/data collections with already heavy work-
loads?" Participants stated that their priorities for study
differed from the priorities of researchers.
Participants also identified difficulties that they thought
were common in research involving older adults with health
and rehabilitation needs, such as recruiting individuals for
research, obtaining informed consent, understanding the
influence of diverse cultural backgrounds in the research
process, varying literacy levels, the presence of multiple
comorbid health conditions, and increased risk of mortality
compared with other groups. Finally, attitudinal barriers
related to the aging population such as stereotyping and pub-
lic misperceptions were reported; "they're going to fall any-
way" and "it's a part of normal aging."
Potential solutions to barriers. Participants were asked to iden-
tify solutions to ameliorate the barriers they identified. Par-
ticipants suggested that improving the quality and quantity
of collaboration between researchers and health care provid-
ers/service providers could be a key strategy to overcome
barriers to research with older adults. Participants stated that
improved KT, through sessions such as the symposium,
would be an effective approach to promoting collaboration.
Participants also identified the need to obtain funding for
research projects as a solution to cost-related barriers. Finally
participants recommended improving public awareness
through advocacy movements and more involvement of stu-
dents in rehabilitation research for older adults during their
training programs.
Participant Feedback on the Symposium.Thirty-four partici-
pants provided numerical ratings of the usefulness of the
symposium, and 23 participants provided written comments.
The median of the scores of participants' ratings of the use-
fulness of the symposium on a scale of 0 (no use) to 10 (very
useful) was 7 (mode = 8). Written feedback was positive and
constructive, for example, "I think sessions like this will pro-
vide the link between research and practice." Participants
also indicated that information presented was relevant:
"Loved the research updates--brief, concise, applicable to
our population."
Other Outcomes: Engagement. Attendees were invited to sign
up to the Special Interest Group on Aging's online database
of stakeholders who wished to be informed about opportuni-
ties to be involved in identifying, developing, implementing
and using research that matters to older adults. The invitation
to join the database was provided on professionally printed
postcards that briefly explained the special interest group,
the purpose of the database, and provided the URL link to the
registry. Attendees were encouraged to take and distribute
extra postcards to their own networks. Of the 88 KTNE event
participants, 32 joined the database to act as stakeholders in
older adult rehabilitation research. Since the KTNE event,
more than 50 other individuals have joined the database.
Most of the registered stakeholders are health care
providers.
Discussion
Findings from this preliminary citizen engagement and
knowledge translation symposium were encouraging and
members of the Special Interest Group on Aging are plan-
ning to continue with other KTNE symposia across the prov-
ince of Alberta. The findings from this study provided
researchers with knowledge of specific issues of rehabilita-
tion and aging from a citizen perspective, thus extending the
findings of the CIHR Regional Seniors' Workshops on
Research. This current KTNE symposium was attended by
many people from a variety of backgrounds (health care stu-
dents, health care providers, researchers, service providers).
However, members of the public and seniors were largely
absent from this event, which is a limitation of the current
study. Future symposia will include modifications to ensure
a breadth of stakeholders, including members of the general
public. For example, advertising for the event could be con-
ducted with guidance from communications and media
experts, using strategies such as more frequent event notices
over longer periods of time and the use of a variety of media
outlets, including print newspapers and weekly news bulle-
tins/publications for older adults. Also, family members/care
partners of older adults may be more likely to attend if care
programs were provided for older adults who could not stay
alone while family members attended the symposium. Future
symposia will also focus on specific issues of rehabilitation
and aging as identified by the participants from this KTNE
symposium (e.g., falls prevention).
In subsequent events, researchers may also collect data on
the effectiveness of such gatherings in meeting the goals of
citizen engagement in research. Data collected may also be
used to compare responses on research priorities for older
adults on the basis of stakeholder group affiliation (i.e., older
adults, health care providers, policy makers). The format of
the event may also be changed to ensure a wide reach to
audiences in different geographical locations. Because it is
not practical, nor cost-effective, to have several researchers
travel to multiple rural and/or remote locations, the Special
Interest Group on Aging is planning to develop prerecorded,
multimedia presentations. These will be presented to audi-
ences across the province of Alberta. Two trained facilitators
will attend each of the sessions and guide the postpresenta-
tion small group discussions. The Special Interest Group on
Aging will also be able to provide continuity between KTNE
Suleman et al. 5
symposia so as to better understand the scope of issues aris-
ing across the province. This model is a relatively low-cost
strategy to maximize opportunities for older adults and fam-
ily members outside of large urban settings to have access to
up-to-date research knowledge and provide input regarding
future studies.
Conclusion
At the University of Alberta, a group of researchers inter-
ested in rehabilitation research in aging developed and
implemented a citizen engagement symposium. The event
was well attended although the diversity of citizens who
attended the event was limited. Attendees provided research-
ers with feedback on issues in rehabilitation research for
older adults, including priority topics for research and dis-
cussion at future symposia. Continued refinement and testing
of this promising event will be the focus of upcoming citizen
engagement endeavors.
