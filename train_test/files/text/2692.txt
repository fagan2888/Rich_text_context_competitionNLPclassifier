This paper seeks to return scholarly attention to a core intellectual
divide between segmented and conventional (or neo-)assimilation
approaches, doing so through a theoretical and empirical reconsidera-
tion of contextual effects on second-generation outcomes. We evaluate
multiple approaches to measuring receiving country contextual effects
and measuring their impact on the educational attainment of the chil-
dren of immigrants. We demonstrate that our proposed measures bet-
ter predict second-generation educational attainment than prevailing
approaches, enabling a multilevel modeling strategy that accounts for
the structure of immigrant families nested within different receiving
contexts.
INTRODUCTION
Introduced in the early 1990s by Portes and Zhou, the hypothesis of seg-
mented assimilation galvanized research on the "new" second generation.
The ensuing outpouring of scholarship, both supportive and critical, has
largely focused on its most controversial claims: that assimilation could
have both negative and positive consequences; that the negative

consequences would entail downward assimilation into an underclass; and
that groups at risk of downward assimilation would do better if full accul-
turation were slowed down by at least one generation (Portes and Rum-
baut 2001, 54).
While stimulating both thought and research, that debate has some-
how elided the fundamental theoretical challenge posed by this alternative
to prevailing sociological understandings of assimilation. As framed by
Alba and Nee (2003), in a formulation no less influential than that of
Portes and Zhou, assimilation is understood as resulting from the individ-
ual pursuit of rational action. In this view, the immigrants' need to pur-
sue a better life in a strange, foreign environment produces small, virtually
costless, cumulative changes, each one of which makes the next advance a
bit easier. With time, immigrants acquire skills and the capacity to
demonstrate competence, gaining recognition, reward, and exposure to an
increasingly diverse mix of people.
Yet it is precisely this approach -- "research . . . dominated by a
strong individualistic bent where the social context in which economic
success or failure takes place is either absent or is introduced in ad hoc
fashion" (Portes 1995, 274)" -- that the hypothesis of segmented assimi-
lation rejects. By contrast, segmented assimilation theory emphasizes the
importance of the context of reception, a feature of the society of immi-
gration and one shared by all members of the group and which in turn
overrides or amplifies the effect of individual characteristics. For Portes,
Rumbaut, Zhou, and other proponents of this theoretical perspective, the
crucial contextual influences derive from the ways in which migration pol-
icy, reception by the native population, and characteristics of the co-ethnic
community combine to create a distinct mode of incorporation. Varying
across groups and conditioning the emergence of strong and solidary or
weak and fragmented communities, modes of incorporation can both
directly produce positive, negative, or even neutral effects, and can also
indirectly alter the impacts of such individual attributes as skills or experi-
ence. If the mode of incorporation proves positive, the social environment
can either enhance the benefits of individual-level resources or compensate
for their absence. By contrast, the opposite occurs when incorporation
takes place via a negative mode: The benefits of individual-level resources
are overridden and the fallout from any deficit is enlarged.
This paper seeks to return scholarly attention to this core intellectual
divide between segmented and conventional (or neo-)assimilation
approaches, doing so through a theoretical and empirical reconsideration

of contextual effects on second-generation outcomes. As we will show, the
empirical approach followed by Portes and his collaborators is deficient:
their criteria for defining context of reception are neither clear nor stable;
context of reception is never directly measured, but instead proxied by
nationality; and reliance on country of origin proxies precludes the multi-
level modeling necessary to directly test for the impact of specific contex-
tual effects. Furthermore, although they propose a two-level model,
entailing direct (main) and indirect (interactive) effects, their analysis of
second-generation outcomes only examines direct effects.
In the pages below, we rectify these shortcomings. First, we intro-
duce the idea of a multilevel model of contextual effects, using three
objective measures to create a one-dimensional scale that ranks national-
origin groups according to the favorability of the receiving context. Sec-
ond, to conceptualize the receiving context in a multidimensional way, we
enter our three objective measures of reception context as group-level vari-
ables in a multilevel regression model. Third, we enter interaction terms
between our group-level variables and family-level human capital. We
apply this new approach to the analysis of educational attainment among
second-generation young adults in the United States.
For this analysis, we draw on two large-scale surveys: Immigrant Sec-
ond Generation in Metropolitan New York (ISGMNY) conducted in
1998/1999 and Immigration and Intergenerational Mobility in Metropoli-
tan Los Angeles (IIMMLA), undertaken in 2004. Both engage with the
same issue motivating this paper and hence contain the relevant, migra-
tion-related information; both entailed quota sampling of specific second-
generation populations. We pooled the two surveys generating a dataset
with extensive origin-level variation (we have at least one representative
from 67 national-origin groups), thereby gaining the capacity to systemati-
cally analyze the net impact of variation of each context dimension on the
variation in the outcome variable, in this case, years of education.
Taking the three contextual factors identified by the segmented
assimilation perspective as our point of departure, our analysis provides
support for the importance of societal reception and group-level resources
when predicting educational attainment. In contrast, we do not find any
evidence that governmental reception matters for educational attainment.
In addition to these main effects, we use cross-level interactions to exam-
ine how the context of reception alters the educational transmission pro-
cess within immigrant families. Our results suggest that among families
facing a favorable societal context of reception and enjoying the capacity
RECONCEPTUALIZING CONTEXT 3
to draw on significant group-level resources, parental human capital has a
bigger effect on second-generation educational attainment. Or viewed the
other way around, the friendliness of the context of reception makes the
greatest difference for families with high human capital. While clearly
highlighting the relevance of some aspects of the reception context, the
analysis reveals significant complexities that existing approaches, based on
more or less ad hoc comparisons of national-origin groups, did not
detect.
PREVIOUS FORMULATIONS OF THE CONCEPT
Initially introduced by Portes and Bach in their 1985 study of Mexican
and Cuban immigrants, the idea of "modes of incorporation" received its
full exposition in Portes and Rumbaut's 1990 Immigrant America, later to
be expounded in identical terms in the second, third, and fourth editions
of Immigrant America as well as in Legacies. The authors put forward the
concept of "context of reception," identifying receiving government poli-
cies, labor market conditions, and the characteristics of groups' own eth-
nic communities as the salient components. Disaggregating government
policies, the authors identified exclusion, passive acceptance, or active
encouragement as the three relevant types. Labor market conditions also
included several features, of which the most important was "the manner
in which particular immigrant groups are typified" (1990, 86), whether
positively or negatively, thus underlying the centrality of a preference for
or prejudice against certain ethnicities. The ethnic community is classified
by class composition. If it includes primarily manual workers, commu-
nity-level networks can facilitate access only to entry-level jobs. In con-
trast, if the community includes a significant business or professional
element, "support of ethnic networks is not contingent on acceptance of a
working-class lifestyle" and newcomers may be introduced "from the start
to the whole range of opportunities. . ." (1990, 89; italics added). Modes
of incorporation figured prominently in Portes and Zhou's seminal 1993
article on the second generation, as they contended that "the context that
immigrants find upon arrival. . .plays a decisive role in the course that
their offspring's lives will follow" (82); likewise, modes of incorporation
was a cornerstone concept in Legacies.
Although the context of reception is positioned at the very core of
segmented assimilation theory, the concept has never been operationalized;
rather than measure mode of incorporation, Portes and his collaborators
4 INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION REVIEW
consistently proxied it by using nationality. Thus, when Portes and Rum-
baut find that between-group differences persist after the application of
various controls, they conclude that "the direction of these effects fits clo-
sely with our knowledge of the modes of incorporation for each of these
immigrant groups" (Portes and Rumbaut 2006, 271; emphasis added).
However, the source of that knowledge is never identified; moreover, the
judgments entailed in placing groups in the typology are often ad hoc.
For example, it may well be the case that "neutral" appropriately describes
the governmental policy response to the migration of both Jamaicans and
Chinese, as asserted in Legacies. And yet, as for decades, substantial num-
bers of Chinese have entered as foreign students, and more recently as
temporary high-skilled workers, and permanent residence was granted to
Chinese students living in the United States as of the Tiananmen Square
massacre, one wonders whether it might not be better to describe this
migration as one in which "authorities take active steps to encourage a
particular inflow" (2001, 47)."
Second, despite emphasizing the importance of group-level charac-
teristics on individual-level outcomes, most empirical treatments of seg-
mented assimilation theory ignore the nested, hierarchical structure
required for models which include contextual variables. Segmented assimi-
lation theory includes a lower level of individual and family-level pro-
cesses, nested within or clustered by a higher level of national origins.
Group-level characteristics at the higher level exert an independent effect
on second-generation outcomes while also altering the family- and indi-
vidual-level processes at the lower level. Consequently, we need sufficient
cases -- here, national origins -- at the higher level to systematically
assess the importance of contextual variables while accounting for compo-
sitional differences within groups. This affords a multilevel modeling
structure which can separately evaluate the impact of a group-level trait
-- in this case, the mean level of education -- from the effect of the cor-
responding characteristic working at the individual level -- in this case,
parental education.
Third, while the works reviewed above contend that modes of incor-
poration result from the combination of types of each different feature,
nowhere can one find a hypothesis specifying the effects likely to be pro-
duced by different combinations, a significant deficiency as the typology
developed in Legacies involved three different features, prejudiced/neutral
societal reception, hostile/neutral/favorable government reception, and
poor/working class/professional co-ethnic community (2 9 3 9 3),
RECONCEPTUALIZING CONTEXT 5
leading to 18 different combinations. At the extremes, the possibility that
different combinations of features could yield significant differences cer-
tainly seems reasonable: A context entailing favorable governmental recep-
tion and neutral societal reception and a professional co-ethnic
community could well yield advantages in contrast to the diametrically
opposite context involving hostile government policy and prejudiced soci-
etal reception and poor co-ethnic community. The appropriate test, how-
ever, would involve changing only one of the three determining variables
(policy, societal reception, and co-ethnic community) at a time, leaving
the other two constant. Indeed, a recent appraisal using this method finds
little empirical support for such smaller combinatorial differences (Wal-
dinger and Catron 2016). Moreover, even when implementing this
method, it proves impossible to assess the effects of each dimension indi-
vidually: Does government reception matter more or less than societal
reception in influencing educational outcomes for the children of immi-
grants?
Last, as noted above, Portes, Rumbaut, Zhou, and collaborators pro-
pose the existence of cross-level interactions. These authors first emphasize
the main effect associated with mode of incorporation and socioeconomic
success: At the group level, more positive modes of incorporation yield
better net outcomes than negative modes of incorporation. But they also
anticipate that mode of incorporation will influence relationships at the
individual level, altering the relationship between skills or experience and
individual-level outcomes. Thus, in chapter 4 of Legacies, Portes and
Rumbaut "consider two alternative effects of group differences in contexts
of reception: their direct causal impact on socioeconomic achievement
and the extent to which they modify the influence of individual human
capital and other variables. In statistical parlance, the first are additive
effects and the second are interactive effects. In that chapter, Portes and
Rumbaut examine main (or additive) and interactive impacts as they affect
the earnings of the parents of the immigrant children studied in Legacies,
finding, for example, that years of US residence have no effect on the
earnings of Mexican and Nicaraguan parents, while increasing earnings
among Cuban and Vietnamese parents. Yet while they also contend that
first-generation trajectories mold second-generation experiences, empiri-
cally they never take up the question of how modes of incorporation
interact with parents' characteristics to affect outcomes among the chil-
dren themselves. As the argument that "social context . . . can alter, in
decisive ways, the link between individual skills and motivations and their
6 INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION REVIEW
expected rewards" (Portes and Rumbaut 2006, 102)" is a cornerstone
proposition, we fill in this gap.
RE-CONCEPTUALIZING CONTEXT OF RECEPTION
In a later section of this paper, we address these lacunae, evaluating the
main and interactive effects of each dimension of the mode of incorpora-
tion with objective measures. First, however, we identify those contextual
features of the reception society likely to influence second-generation out-
comes. Those features correspond to the three components comprising
"modes of incorporation," but are specified in ways that more clearly
identify the mechanism linking each context to outcome and also allow
for more precise measurement.
Governmental Reception: Policy and Status Prevalence
As noted in a recent National Academy report, US immigration policy
has seen "the proliferation of immigration statuses that provide different
degrees of permanence and security," (NASEM 2015, 2-2) with the result
that legal status has become "a new axis of social stratification, similar to
other social markers such as social class, gender, and race" (NASEM
2015, 3­22). For our purposes, the crucial immigration statuses fall into
three broad categories: undocumented status, which can be characterized
as hostile; refugee status, which is favorable, encouraging migration and
affording rights and assistance for permanent residence, including reunifi-
cation with family members; and a residual "neutral" category of those
who enter as immigrants, namely green card holders and those with fixed
term visas, for whom immigration is not actively encouraged but who
with documented status enjoy greater rights than legally present "nonim-
migrant" visitors. By exploiting the within-group prevalence of undocu-
mented and refugee members, we can characterize immigrants as
positively, negatively, or neutrally received by the US government. We
expect this group characterization to influence second-generation outcomes
in myriad ways.
Undocumented migration is path dependent, reflecting its deeply
entrenched character, its linkage to ongoing recruitment networks and infor-
mal contacts between settlers and newcomers, as well as the specific histori-
cal conditions linking sending and receiving countries (Massey, Durand,
and Malone 2002). Undocumented status is therefore very unevenly
RECONCEPTUALIZING CONTEXT 7
distributed across immigrants of different origins, a pattern that may inten-
sify the strength of the link between nationality, on the one hand, and civic
stratification and social stigma on the other. Insofar as undocumented
migration impedes individual social mobility (Bean et al. 2011; Yoshikawa
2011), it may also yield a cumulative impact, attenuating the capacity to
mobilize resources through ethnic social networks, whether the resources are
those relevant to the search for jobs, the sharing of business context, or par-
ticipation in community institutions. Consequently, we hypothesize that
negative impacts on second-generation outcomes can be expected in popula-
tions among whom undocumented immigration is widespread.
By contrast, refugee status is valuable. Whereas standard modes of
entry -- whether as legal "nonimmigrant" (tourists, students, businessper-
sons), legal permanent resident, or unauthorized immigrant -- result
solely from individual- or household-level decisions, in the United States
refugee movements are more centrally organized, reflecting the fact that
the status needs to be determined prior to migration and typically gets
applied to larger subpopulations of origin countries. Refugee policy both
facilitates the entry of selected groups fleeing persecution and assists their
subsequent integration. Members of the initial refugee wave may be par-
ticularly vulnerable, often arriving without a base of co-ethnics to provide
help or orientation. But that situation no longer holds for the later arri-
vals, who benefit both from their own refugee status and from the advan-
tages that this same status generated for the earlier group of newcomers.
Thus, as compared to undocumented status, the prevalence of refugee sta-
tus varies even more widely across national-origin groups; where wide-
spread, we hypothesize that effects will be positive.
Co-Ethnic Community: Group-Level Education
The distribution of legal status across national-origin groups within any
particular country largely results from government policies and decisions.
Although not entirely independent of government policies, other factors
lead migrations to vary greatly in selectivity, with implications for group-
level characteristics that may also affect immigrant and second-generation
outcomes. For example, Indians comprise the most positively selected of
immigrants living in the United States: Schooling among the average
Indian immigrant exceeds a college degree. Mexican migration is also
selective: While the poorest segments of Mexico's population typically lack
the resources needed to move to the United States, well-educated
8 INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION REVIEW
Mexicans have little incentive to move to the United States, as employers
tend not to adequately reward their investment in schooling. Conse-
quently, Mexican emigration is more likely to stem from populations that
are deprived relative to the United States, but better off than average in
Mexico (Feliciano 2005).
As with legal status, we hypothesize that group-level differences in
educational attainment will alter the ability to capitalize on ethnic social
capital, for reasons related to the resources that schooling helps individuals
to access and the symbolic meaning it conveys. On average, group-level
education is correlated with other resources likely to affect immigrant and
second-generation outcomes, whether having to do with the ways in
which referral networks connect to employers and jobs, the quality and
diversity of information conveyed through ethnic ties, or the degree of
engagement and understanding of host society institutions (Borjas 1992).
To the extent that social circles tie immigrants and their offspring to other
people of the same origin, the rewards of education or the penalties of
lack of schooling may be widely shared. Just such an example can be
found in Inheriting the City, a book based on one of the surveys used in
this paper: The authors mention a barely literate Chinese mother in New
York, who knew her daughter should go to an elite public high school,
requiring passage of a competitive examination (Kasinitz, Mollenkopf, and
Waters 2008, 352), thus highlighting how cross-class cutting social ties
and strong ethnic solidarity can promote upward mobility among disad-
vantaged members of a diverse group.
Moreover, education also has a reputational effect, sending a signal
to outsiders, who may focus on the obvious characteristics that a person
might share with others of the same or similar background, as opposed to
individual traits (Lee and Fiske 2006). Indeed, these tendencies toward
statistical discrimination have discouraged the migration of higher-skilled
Mexican immigrants, whom employers are apt to perceive through the
prism of the average Mexican immigrant, whose schooling is relatively
low (Mattoo, Neagu, and 
Ozden 2008).
Societal Reception: Prejudice and Discrimination
While the average educational profile of an immigrant group may yield
reputational effects, other characteristics are likely to influence the ways in
which any foreign-origin group is perceived. At the turn of the twentieth
century, immigrants from eastern and southern Europe were seen as
RECONCEPTUALIZING CONTEXT 9
swarthy, but at the turn of the twenty-first century they are perceived as
white and hence indistinguishable from the dominant group (Roediger
2005). Migration streams from elsewhere in the world may not share that
same acceptability. Migrants from the Caribbean and Africa are likely to
suffer from long-standing prejudices against persons of African origin.
While persons of Mexican background are often seen as occupying an
intermediate position in the American racial order, somewhere between
blacks and whites, that characterization also implies some significant
degree of rejection. The prevalence of the "model minority" image may
be a source of protection for immigrants from Asia, but the view that
Asians are also "forever foreigners" suggests that levels of acceptability
may not reach those attained by contemporary immigrants from Europe
or Canada. For instance, Hersch (2011) documents a significant wage dis-
advantage between immigrants of the lightest and darkest skin colors.
Although there is a great deal of phenotypical diversity within origin
groups, broad ethno-racial categories of "Asian," "Latino," and "black" are
strongly associated with region of origin and thus racial stratification can
operate at the group as well as the individual level. Moreover, extensive
qualitative evidence of "colorism," or disadvantage by darkness of skin,
exists even within pan-ethnic and racial groupings (Bonilla-Silva 2006;
Hunter 2007), suggesting the importance of still finer variation in skin
color at the national-origin level within broader racial groupings.
In the remainder of this paper, we test for these contextual effects in
two ways. First, we create a unidimensional scale measuring context of
reception derived from the Legacies framework, testing for its impact on
educational attainment in a multilevel framework. Second, we replace this
unidimensional second-level variable with a multidimensional second-level
model including objective measures corresponding to each of the context
concepts outlined above: governmental reception, co-ethnic community,
and societal reception.
MODEL
We use a multilevel model that takes the nested structure of families
within groups into account, adjusting for the correlation in individual-
level characteristics within origin groups and testing for both the direct
and the contextual effect (Gelman 2012) of educational attainment among
immigrants on the educational attainment of the second generation. We
take the educational attainment y of respondent (i) nested in group j as a
10 INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION REVIEW
function of parental Education E and a matrix of control variables X.
Each group j has a different intercept aj
which is normally distributed
and modeled as a function of the group-level variables Z. Small greek let-
ters indicate (vectors) of coefficients with b indicating the effect of paren-
tal education and the vector c, the effects of the control variables. In the
second line, the vector h indicates the effects of the group-level variables
Z on the intercept a.

In a next step, we let the effect of parental education b vary across

Methodologically, this follows a line of inquiry that has used multi-
level models to ascertain the effects of contextual variables on educational
outcomes among the children of immigrants (Levels et al. 2008) or on
other socioeconomic outcomes (e.g., Kanas and Tubergen, 2009). While
most of this Europe-based research has examined variation across different
receiving countries, we are necessarily limited to one receiving country.
However, we exploit here, as have other scholars (Kalmijn and Van
Tubergen 2010), the ample variation in receiving context by national ori-
gin that exists within the United States.
The question then is what is the proper level at which to define the
"community" that faces a context of reception? Ideally one would con-
struct reception context not simply as a function of the country of origin,
but also reflecting variation by period of migration, local context of ori-
gin, and precise location of settlement. While our measure of the co-eth-
nic community takes geography into account, as it is based on data from
New York and Los Angeles, we cannot disaggregate our measures of the
policy context or of societal reception below the national level.
DATA
All individual-level data in the study stem from a pooled sample of two
large-scale surveys of the children of immigrants: Immigrant Second
RECONCEPTUALIZING CONTEXT 11
Generation in Metropolitan New York (ISGMNY, Mollenkopf et al
2011), conducted in 1998­1999 and Immigration and Intergenerational
Mobility in Metropolitan Los Angeles (IIMMLA, Rumbaut et al 2008),
undertaken in 2004. We limit our samples to the children of at least one
foreign-born parent in all analyses, and restrict the age range to those 23
and above to reduce left censoring on our dependent variable, educational
attainment.
We operationalize context using a unidimensional scale drawn from
the Legacies framework as well as drawing on three objective indicators of
each dimension of the context of reception. Each of these methods
requires somewhat different samples. When evaluating the use of mode of
incorporation with the unidimensional context scale, we are necessarily
limited to the national origins discussed in the existing literature, in order
to have sufficient information to assign each origin a value on each of the
mode of incorporation dimensions. These national origins are those quota
sample groups in both the IIMMLA and the ISGMNY, outlined in
Table 1 (N = 2,287; origins = 26). For the multidimensional mode of
incorporation analysis, where we rely on secondary sources to assign val-
ues, rather than current judgments in the literature, we include all
national-origin groups in our sample (N = 2,955; origins = 67).
We do not have full information on some of the group-level variables
in our dataset. In particular, we are missing skin color information on 28
origin groups, or 8 percent of all individual observations. To preserve the
variation in our sending countries, we multiply impute the missing skin
color information at the country level using a variety of national-level indi-
cators (see online Supporting Information). Our imputation results in 15
datasets of imputed values. The standard errors reported in all analyses are
adjusted for multiple imputed data and analyzed using the MI multiple
imputation suite of commands in Stata 13. For our regression analyses that
include group-level variables, we use multilevel mixed-effects models with a
varying intercept to account for the hierarchical structure of the data.
VARIABLES
Dependent Variable
We use second-generation educational attainment as our dependent vari-
able in all models, doing so for a variety of reasons. The first concerns its
substantive importance: Educational attainment is the most important

mediator in the relationship between parental and child occupation and
income (Blau and Duncan 1967). Second, educational attainment, unlike
labor market outcomes, is generally completed and relatively "fixed" by
the mid- to late twenties and therefore can appropriately be examined in
a still young second-generation population. Finally, as an outcome that is
more proximate to and influenced by the childhood environment than
later integration outcomes -- such as those of occupation, income, or
place of residence -- it is an outcome where we may best be able to
observe contextual effects deriving from the immigrant parents' experience
upon arrival in the receiving society.
We measure educational attainment in number of years, using
detailed information on schooling and university completion available in
both surveys.
Independent Variables
The independent variable in all analyses is the context of reception. We first
introduce a multilevel model with a unidimensional context of reception
scale at the national-origin level, followed by a multilevel model with an
indicator for each dimension of the context of reception and finally a
model that adds cross-level interactions.
One-Dimensional Context Scale. In order to identify any possible
systematic relationship between modes of incorporation and second-
generation outcomes, we apply the Legacies framework to create a scale,
following the existing secondary literature in ways that are faithful to the
approach developed by Portes and his collaborators. Thus, in Table 1, we
create a context of reception table displaying the possible combinations of
the three main variables and then populate each cell with origin groups in
IIMMLA and ISGMNY. Using the manuscripts emerging from the
IIMMLA and ISGMNY projects, we characterize the first dimension,
immigration policy, as positive for groups with a large proportion of
refugees, neutral for groups with small proportions of both refugees and
undocumented immigrants, and hostile for groups with large proportions
of undocumented immigrants. The societal reception is divided into
neutral or positive for predominantly European immigrant-origin groups,
and prejudiced for others. Finally, the co-ethnic community is divided
into poor, working class, and entrepreneurial/professional classes,
depending on the self-employment and education levels for each group.
14 INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION REVIEW
Each category of the three features is assigned a number from "0" to "2"
in the table above, and these numbers are then summed to create a
context of reception scale score. As shown in the first line of Table 3, the
average score in the groups we can rank is 3.2, with a range of "1" for
the least favorable to "5" for the most favorably rated groups. Former
Soviet Jews, surveyed in New York, and the Vietnamese, surveyed in Los
Angeles, stand at the top, with rankings of "5" and "4," respectively, and
Mexicans, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans in Los Angeles at the bottom
with a ranking of "1."
Multiple Dimensions of Immigration Contexts. Following the discussion
above, we develop several new measures of the mode of incorporation,
allowing each dimension to be independently assessed and relying on
objective data sources.
To reflect the facilitative and constraining aspects of governmental
reception, we rely on secondary data on legal status prevalence during the
time of parental migration. An appropriate measure of governmental
reception needs to be temporally relevant, reflecting an early period in the
respondents' lives and one prior to the survey. As the respondents sampled
by ISGMNY and IIMMLA were born between 1964 and 1984 to parents
who mainly immigrated to the United States within a 15-year time frame,
from 1968 to 1983 (ISGMNY) or 1970 to 1982 (for IIMMLA), we oper-
ationalize the concept of government reception to reflect key policy devel-
opments during the respondents' youth.
We construct a scale of status prevalence based on two indicators:
(1) the number of persons from any given country legalized under the
regular amnesty program of 1986 as a fraction of the total population
from that country in 1990, and (2) the number of persons admitted as
refugees from any country between 1980 and 1989 as a fraction of all
persons admitted to the United States from that country during the same
period. We compute these proportions using data from the statistical year-
books of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the 1990 Cen-
sus. We distinguish six levels. The most negative (1) includes immigrant
nationalities with a large proportion of undocumented individuals, for
which the number of persons legalized in the 1986 amnesty programs is
equal to or greater to 20 percent of the nationality's 1990 population and
for which no persons were admitted as refugees during the 1980s. At the
other extreme, level six includes nationalities with a large refugee compo-
nent, for which the number of persons admitted as refugees during the

1980s is equal to or greater than 20 percent of the nationality's 1990
population and for which no persons were legalized in the 1986 (defini-
tions of all levels appear in Table 2).1 We enter this scale as a continuous
variable in our analyses, making the strong assumption of equal distance
between each value of the scale. However, we check for sensitivity of our
results to this assumption by including the scale as a series of 0/1 indica-
tors as well.
To assess the impact of co-ethnic community differences in educa-
tion, we use a variable measuring average years of schooling by national
origin for the foreign born aged 25 and older as reported in the 1980 US
Census. As the co-ethnic community is specific to the local context, we
draw on information keyed to respondents' place of residence, whether in
New York or in Los Angeles, to create a summary measure for all respon-
dents in the two surveys. In some cases, the characteristics of the co-ethnic
community vary significantly across the two places: Mainland Chinese in
New York averaged only 9.1 years of education, whereas their compatriots
in Los Angeles had 11.6 -- a full 2.5 years more. Among those from
Hong-Kong, the advantage is even greater with three years more in Los
Angeles as compared to New York City. Among the Vietnamese, by con-
trast, average educational levels as of 1980 were practically the same in
both places.
Last, as a proxy for potential discrimination, we include the mean
skin color of the national-origin group as reported by interviewers from
the New Immigrant Survey, a nationally representative sample of adult

1Arguably, a further disaggregation of the reception context by time period would be help-
ful. However, because the 1986 amnesty program was a one-time event and its related
statistics are the only source that can provide a good estimate of the undocumented popu-
lation for a wide range of national-origin groups, we cannot disaggregate this measure by
period. That said, as our sample is restricted to the children of immigrants aged 23­40,
the variation in parental time of migration is fairly contained.

immigrants admitted to legal permanent residence from May to Novem-
ber of 2003. The scale distinguishes 11 levels of pigmentation, ranging
from the complete absence of color (albinism) to the darkest at 10. The
shades of skin color corresponding to the points one to 10 on the Massey
and Martin Skin Color Scale are depicted in a chart, with each point rep-
resented by a hand, of identical form, but differing in color. The scale is
for use by interviewers, who assign each respondent a score (Massey and
Martin 2003).
Although darker skin color is consistently associated with worse
socioeconomic outcomes (Espino and Franz 2002; Hersch 2011; Branigan
et al. 2013), we recognize that other markers of race and triggers of preju-
diced behavior, such as facial features, dress, and accent, are also impor-
tant and likely to vary within individuals of similar color; likewise, the
skin color of individuals can vary considerably within origin countries.
Our measure cannot capture these elements, nor do our data contain indi-
vidual measures of respondent phenotype, but average skin color serves as
a proxy for the potential for societal prejudice deriving from race.2
The first section of Table 3 presents summary statistics for these
variables. The average education level of the groups in 1980 was
11.6 years with an observed range of 7.6­15.2 years. The average status
prevalence score, our measure for the governmental reception context, for
respondents was 3.65, meaning the average origin group had some IRCA
legalizations (1­20%), but no refugees. The group-level average skin color
ranges from 1.44 (close to the very white end of the scale) to 7.44 with
an average of 3.90, close to the middle of the scale.
Table 4 presents the correlations between each approach to measur-
ing contextual effects and our dependent variable. Looking down the first
column, we see that each of the variables we have created to measure
immigration context is moderately to strongly correlated with second-gen-
eration educational attainment, with the darkness of skin color negatively
associated and positive legal status and mean years education at the group
level positively associated. Important to note is that the context variables
are also correlated with each another: Groups with darker skin color tend
to have a more negative legal context of reception, and also lower levels of

in these dimensions overlap and mutually re-enforce each other.
Control Variables. To better isolate contextual effects, we include a variety
of individual-level controls drawn from the literature on second-

differences in educational attainment by including age, sex, and

metropolitan area (Los Angeles v. New York). We also control for
whether the respondent is still enrolled in school. Family resources,
expected to be positively associated with respondent second-generation
attainment, are included with a measure for the highest parental
education and occupation, and an indicator for coming from an intact
family where the biological parents lived with the respondent from ages
six to 18.
In order to hold constant family- and individual-level assimilation,
we include a measure of the language spoken in the parental household,
as all English, mostly English or mostly non-English language. We also
control for generation and citizenship status, including a categorical vari-
able identifying foreign-born respondents without US citizenship, natural-
ized foreign-born, and US-born respondents. Information on parental
place of birth allows us to control for membership in the 2.5 generation.
Summary statistics for all these variables can be found in the second part
of Table 3.
ANALYSIS
Consistency of Context Indicators
First, we examine the relationships between the different approaches to
measuring contextual effects. Table 5 displays group-level means of the
measures of sending and receiving context we have obtained from sec-
ondary sources by national origins and the context of reception scale
adapted from the Portes/Rumbaut typologies of modes of incorporation
(as described above).
At the extremes, as expected, we immediately see congruence in the
three operationalization measures. The Central American groups with the
most negative context of reception score share a medium-dark average
skin color, low average years of education, and a uniformly negative legal
context of reception. Similarly, the Eastern European groups that occupy
the most positive context of reception cell in the Legacies table share
higher levels of group education, high refugee rates, and are predomi-
nantly light-skinned. However, the large number of respondents who
occupy the intermediate cells of the table is actually quite heterogeneous.
Professional ethnic groups with neutral government receptions, but a neg-
ative societal reception, are very diverse: High levels of education and low
percentages of undocumented immigrants prevail among Filipinos; the
RECONCEPTUALIZING CONTEXT 19
Chinese, in contrast, have lower average levels of education and an undoc-
umented minority. Colombians once again represent another configura-
tion, reporting an undocumented minority but with an average education
at 11 years and a generally light complexion. Hence, even when using the
multidimensional framework developed in Legacies and in other writings,
origin groups that fall into the moderate context of reception configura-
tions appear upon closer inspection to be quite dissimilar.
Comparing Context Indicators as Predictors of Educational Attainment
In order to empirically assess the different approaches outlined above, we
compare a series of models, regressing years of education on both the uni-
dimensional and multidimensional measures of contextual effects, along-
side typical controls for individual-level factors. The samples differ slightly
as described above, but each model uses a combined sample of observa-
tions from both IIMMLA and ISGMNY, restricted to those aged 23 and
above with valid responses to all control variables. We enter these control
variables in four steps, first only controlling for age, sex, and schooling
status (Model 1), then including parental education, parental occupation,
whether the respondent was separated from a biological parent during
childhood (Model 2); we then add the language spoken in the respon-
dent's childhood home (Model 3), and finally respondent's place of birth,

and respondent's citizenship status (Model 4). Table 6 presents a sum-
mary of these results focusing on the context measures. The full models
can be found in the online Supporting Information.
One-Dimensional Context of Reception Scale. We first evaluate the impact
of contextual effects using the one-dimensional context of reception scale.
The results of this endeavor are seen in the first part of Table 6.
The effect of the scale is statistically significant across all specifica-
tions. A one-point increase in the context of reception scale is associated
with about one-half year of additional expected schooling among the chil-
dren of immigrants of the same age and sex. However, more than 40 per-
cent of this effect is accounted for by individual-level factors such as
parental educational, occupation, and family separation. After all controls
have been applied (far right column), the context of reception continues
to yield an effect but it is now more modest, at about one-third of a year
of expected schooling. These initial results therefore confirm the impor-
tance of national-origin context on second-generation educational attain-
ment, but do not provide further insight into which dimension(s) of the
context of reception may be driving this result.
Multiple Dimensions of Context. In the next section of Table 6, we show
the results of a series of models using separate, objectively defined
indicators for each of the mode of incorporation variables. Both average
years of education in the community and average group skin color yield
statistically significant results. In the first model with only demographic
controls, a one-year increase in average education in the community is
associated with about a one-fourth of a year increase in respondent's
education. This coefficient declines by about half once all individual-level
control variables are added and in the final Model 4, each additional year
in the average education level of co-ethnics is associated with an increase
of 0.14 years completed education. This result confirms earlier research
demonstrating the importance of ethnic group human capital on
intergenerational mobility (Borjas 1992). However, our analysis here
further demonstrates that the impact of ethnic group resources on
educational attainment holds even when including further origin group-
level controls.
Turning to societal perception, we see that each shade darker in the
group average skin color is associated with a decrease of about one-fifth of
a year of education. Interestingly, this negative effect is not accounted for

by compositional differences at the individual level: The coefficient size
remains fairly constant across all models as we introduce additional con-
trols. Moreover, even after accounting for the fact that darker-skinned
groups have lower levels of education and worse contexts of reception at
the group level, group skin color maintains an independent association
with lower levels of schooling in the second generation.
Finally, the coefficient for the legal status prevalence scale is both
substantively small and not statistically significant, throughout all of our
models. We conducted several sensitivity tests to confirm this unexpected
finding, including entering the reception scale as a categorical variable and
entering the percent refugee and percent IRCA regularizations separately.
The coefficients remained insignificant across all models.
Multiple Dimensions of Context with Cross-Level Interactions. The final
rows in Table 6 display the results including the multiple dimensions of
context as well as cross-level interactions between these dimensions and
family-level resources (highest parental education). To facilitate
interpretation, all variables are grand-mean-centered. In the final model
including all controls, significant (at the 0.1 level) interactions exist
between the individual-level variable of parental years of education, on the
one hand, and the group-level variables of skin color and average years of
education, on the other. The relationship between parental and
respondent education is stronger in populations with higher average levels
of education. In contrast, the relationship between parental and
respondent education is weaker among immigrant groups with darker skin
color.
To summarize these relationships, Figure I displays the intergenera-
tional transmission coefficient for immigrant families belonging to
national-origin groups of different mean levels of education, for those in
groups with the lightest (1.5 on the skin color scale) and the darkest skin
color (7 on the skin color scale). For instance, the educational attainment
of an immigrant parent belonging to a group with the darkest skin color
and very low group-level years of education has essentially no relationship
to the educational attainment of the second-generation child. For an
immigrant from a white-origin group with high mean education, the
transmission rate approaches the US national average (Card 2005), with a
transmission rate of slightly over 0.3. Thus, the contextual effects of the
group at large exert not only a main effect, but also interact with the sta-
tus transmission process within the immigrant family. Individual
RECONCEPTUALIZING CONTEXT 23
immigrants from groups with darker skin color, or lower levels of educa-
tion, are less able to transmit their educational attainment to their
US-raised children.
DISCUSSION
Our paper is the first to systematically operationalize and compare alterna-
tive approaches to the measurement of contextual effects in second-genera-
tion educational attainment. Furthermore, we have gone beyond the
typical nationality (i.e., dummy variable) approach by interacting each
indicator with parental education, thereby testing whether context yields
an interactive as well as an additive, or main, effect. A rigorous assessment
of the currently dominant modes of incorporation approach is clearly
required, yet our endeavor also shows the formidable empirical hurdles

involved. The greatest challenge entails finding reasonably proximal indi-
cators of the concepts measured at a level of detail that represent migrant
origins at the national level and not broader categories such as "Central
American."
These difficulties notwithstanding, we believe that we have success-
fully introduced new potential measures of each dimension of the mode
of incorporation. In the case of group-level resources, this has proven rela-
tively easy: Group-level education strongly and significantly predicts sec-
ond-generation attainment; its relationship to years of education is robust
to many alternative specifications. Other dimensions reveal some distance
between the measurements we could assemble and the underlying con-
cepts. The difficulty in measuring societal discrimination has required the
use of an indirect proxy for potential discrimination, skin color, likely
weakening the observed relationship between this variable and second-gen-
eration educational attainment. However, the effect of skin color remains
significant and in the expected direction even in models including all indi-
vidual-level controls; therefore, it likely captures the societal reception
context as outlined above. Moreover, in separate analyses not presented
here, we observed a stronger relationship between group average skin color
and second-generation outcomes than between group-level reports of dis-
crimination and second-generation outcomes.3 We also believe that our
measure of status prevalence is of high quality, relying on detailed infor-
mation from official statistics at the national-origin level. Thus, the lack
of statistical significance points to the possibility that this dimension of
the reception context may in fact not systematically affect second-genera-
tion educational attainment. Given that even undocumented children of
immigrants often have to "learn to be illegal" (Gonzales 2011) only after
leaving the protection of formal schooling, educational attainment may be
a second-generation outcome less vulnerable to group-level status preva-
lence than, for instance, labor market outcomes or political participation.
In addition to providing new, objective, and replicable measures of
mode of incorporation, we also compared alternative ways of operational-
izing the concept in models predicting second-generation educational
attainment. Recent systematic evaluations of this approach using the CILS
data (Waldinger and Catron 2016) have found that when systematically
applied to all meaningful comparisons, and varying one dimension at a
time, results are often inconsistent with the predictions of the modes of
3Results available on request.
RECONCEPTUALIZING CONTEXT 25
incorporation model. In additional analyses, which are available as Supple-
mental Material, we implement a similar approach using the IIMMLA
and IMSGNY data and come to conclusions similar to those reported by
Waldinger and Catron.
The one-dimensional context of reception scale tested here has sig-
nificant advantages over country-by-country, context of reception compar-
isons; it is more parsimonious, and collapsing these differences into a
scale also enables us to employ appropriate multilevel models, which take
into account the correlation of observations within national-origin groups.
Most importantly, the scale also better predicts second-generation attain-
ment.
However, this scale remains problematic. Unlike the alternative
approach we develop, it lacks the ability to discern mechanisms underly-
ing the group-level differences in academic performance: Is it the legal
context, the societal context, or the community characteristics that matters
most? Moreover, this approach shares a weakness with the country-by-
county origin comparisons in that it relies on subjective decisions about
where in the Legacies table each country of origin resides; the researcher
must either be highly knowledgeable of the legal and local context facing
each immigrant group or rely on the existing categorizations, as we have
done.
The multidimensional approach developed in this paper addresses all
of these concerns. First, by including measures of legal context, societal
context, and co-ethnic community characteristics, we can discern which
dimensions of the reception context exert an impact on second-generation
outcomes and also how those effects vary. Second, as opposed to the sub-
jective rankings presented in Legacies and other related works, we rely on
objective measures of each dimension: INS statistics for governmental
context of reception, group average skin color measures for societal recep-
tion, and the average level of education for the foreign born of the same
ethnic group in the local context (New York City boroughs or Los Ange-
les county). Using these secondary sources, additional origin countries can
be easily added to the model, and this approach can also be exported to
other receiving countries.
This operationalization allows us to identify the distinctive impact of
each contextual variable on second-generation educational attainment, net
of other contextual- and individual-level measures. In turn, we gain the
capacity to assess the relative importance and impact of one contextual
variable relative to the other. Thus, a standard deviation change in group-
26 INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION REVIEW
level education (1.58) in our final Model 4 is associated with a 0.19
(0.12 9 1.58) years increase in predicted years of education. While a stan-
dard deviation change toward darker group-level skin color is associated
with an effect of comparable size, it yields a 0.18 decrease (À0.14 9 1.29)
in years of education.
Finally, to fully evaluate the predictions of segmented assimilation,
we need to examine not only the main effect of the context of reception
on second-generation attainment but also the ways in which contextual
characteristics at the group level facilitate or hinder status transmission
within immigrant families. Our effort to do so actually confirms one of
the key contentions on which the hypothesis of segmented assimilation
rests: namely that, in addition to a direct impact, context can alter the
impact of parental resources. However, we bring significant further refine-
ment to that hypothesis, as we show that these interactive effects take
complex form. On the one hand, belonging to a disadvantaged group,
with low educational resources or exposure to prejudice due to darker
skin, diminishes overall educational attainment net of individual-level
characteristics. On the other hand, family-level resources matter less for
second-generation members of disadvantaged groups. The consequences
are paradoxical as they can point toward greater opportunity in the sense
that one's parental pedigree matters less for how one does in life, but they
may also mean that advantaged members of these disadvantaged groups
will be less able to pass on their higher achievements to their children.
Separating out the main and interaction effects of the context of reception
enables us to explain what is often framed as contradictory findings in the
literature: the ability of the children of disadvantaged immigrant groups
to greatly surpass their parents in terms of educational attainment (lower
transmission due to interaction with parental education), while still lag-
ging behind more privileged immigrant groups and native whites (negative
main effect on attainment).
CONCLUSION
Although endlessly contested, assimilation has long provided the master
concept for understanding the transformations undergone by immigrants
and their descendants. However insightful, this perspective neglects the
context under which international migration occurs, a shortcoming
which the theory of segmented assimilation attempts to address.
Although contextual factors are inherently of sociological interest, the
RECONCEPTUALIZING CONTEXT 27
very nature of population movements across states gives them heightened
importance.
The influence of context on the incorporation of immigrants has
long been a central theme in the work of Alejandro Portes, who has
advanced "modes of incorporation" as a concept for summarizing the key
contextual factors linked to the receiving context. However, we find this
approach wanting. As we have shown, the concept itself is fuzzy and ill-
defined; the criteria used for assigning nationalities to modes of incorpora-
tion are subjective, with the result that nationalities differing on objective
characteristics have been assigned to the same mode of incorporation.
Most importantly, the concept is never operationalized, but rather mea-
sured by the proxy of nationality, thus relying on names when generaliz-
able theory demands variables.
Responding to precisely that challenge, this paper has disaggregated
mode of incorporation into its three components -- policy reception,
societal reception, and co-ethnic community -- identifying the objective
indicators of status prevalence, mean years of schooling, and mean skin
color that correspond to each concept. In so doing, we gain the leverage
needed to discriminate among each of the distinctive contextual influences
that might affect second-generation outcomes, generate a metric that links
differences in contextual factors to the outcome of interest, and assess the
importance of one factor, relative to another.
As we have shown, this approach yields superior results. Comparing
names generates coefficients that are only inconsistently significant (Wal-
dinger and Catron 2016). An index ranking nationalities according to the
advantage/disadvantage associated with a mode of incorporation produces
more robust effects, but it is neither a meaningful metric (what, exactly, is
entailed in a one-step difference in modes of incorporation?) nor does it
identify the specific feature -- government policy, societal reaction, or co-
ethnic community -- responsible for the result. Our method, in contrast,
allows us to defensibly assign a large number of national-origin groups
with different values on all three dimensions of the immigrant context of
reception. We can then go on to use multilevel models that allow the
comparison of the relative, and independent, impact of both group- and
individual-level characteristics on second-generation educational attain-
ment, as well as the interaction between the two.
As the measures we use are objective and drawn from publicly avail-
able sources, these indicators can be applied by other scholars to other
datasets; their utility can be assessed in light of alternatives that other
28 INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION REVIEW
researchers may propose. And so we close our paper with the all too com-
mon call for more research, motivated by the belief that in this case the
stakes are simply too high to rely on rule-of the thumb judgments of criti-
cal concepts and inconsistent operationalization.
