Objectives. Hearing loss is increasingly common among older persons and is negatively associated with health and
well-being. Its impact on spouses, however, is poorly researched. This study analyzed the relationship between a spouse's
self-assessed hearing loss and his or her partner's physical, psychological, and social well-being 5 years later.
Methods. Subjects were 418 older married couples from the Alameda County Study. Hearing loss and adjustment vari-
ables were assessed in 1994 and outcomes in 1999. Longitudinal analyses included multivariate statistical models using
generalized estimating equations to adjust for paired data and partners' hearing loss, age, gender, chronic conditions, and
financial problems.
Results. Spouse hearing loss increased the likelihood of subsequent poorer physical, psychological, and social well-
being in partners. The negative impact of husbands' hearing loss on wives' well-being appears stronger than the reverse.
Discussion. Findings suggest that early diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss constitute important clinical strategies
to enhance the well-being of both hearing-impaired individuals and their spouses and support policy change to cover
hearing devices by insurance. Further research incorporating theoretical perspectives from communication theory and
qualitative methodology would enhance understanding of how hearing loss impacts older couples and support refinement
of interventions to promote quality of life.
ONE of the most prevalent chronic conditions in older
persons, hearing loss is experienced by .25% of those
age 65­74 and .40% of those age 75 and older (Rees, Duckert,
& Carey, 1999; Schick & Schick, 1994). It has also shown
a near doubling over the last 30 years in the United States, is
higher at all adult ages for males than for females in frequencies
above 1000 Hz, and is becoming increasingly prevalent at
younger ages (Benson & Marano, 1994; Jackson, 1968; Jerger,
Chmiel, Stach, & Spretnjak, 1993; Morrell, Gordon-Salant,
Pearson, Brant, & Fozard, 1996; Pearson et al., 1995; Ries,
1994; Wallhagen, Strawbridge, Cohen, & Kaplan, 1997).
In spite of the prevalence of hearing loss, older adults and
health care providers do not necessarily place much emphasis on
its treatment because it is often considered a normal age-related
change and not a life-threatening condition (Kochkin, 1999).
Yet hearing loss has significant implications for health and
functioning in old age as it is associated with multiple negative
outcomes in physical, psychological, and social domains. These
include diminished functional status and physical disability,
depression, altered self-esteem, and loneliness (Chen, 1994;
Mulrow et al., 1990; Rudberg, Furner, Dunn, & Cassel, 1993;
Wallhagen, Strawbridge, Shema, Kurata, & Kaplan, 2001).
The negative effects of hearing loss are not difficult to
understand if they are considered within the context of social
relationships. Individuals are embedded in a social and cultural
context that includes meaningful relationships and shared
understandings. Social connectedness and strong social ties
are shown repeatedly to be important factors in the health and
well-being of older adults. As early as 1979, lack of strong
social relations was associated with increased mortality (Berk-
man & Syme, 1979), a finding supported by additional animal
as well as human data (House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988). A
recent comprehensive review that focused specifically on the
positive effects of friends and family on health outcomes in
older adults reaffirmed this association and documented
associations between social relationships and physical health,
mental health, and recovery from illness (Seeman, 2000). This
latter review acknowledged, however, the potential negative
effects of poor relationships, an issue that emphasizes the
importance of interactive patterns (Rook, 1984) and the
complex nature of social ties (Kawachi & Berkman, 2001;
Wallhagen, 1999).
Communication is essential to relationships. Cronen, Pearce,
and Harris (1982) noted that ordinary communication is ``the
locus of powerful forces through which persons cocreate,
maintain, and alter social order, personal relationships, and
individual identities. . . . [It] is not simply one of many things
that persons do in relationships; it is the process of maintain-
ing and creating relationships'' (pp. 64­65). Hummert and
Naussbaum (2001) even suggested that communication pro-
vides the essential link between health and successful aging.
However, with the onset of hearing loss, long-standing patterns
of communication can be altered and patterns previously taken
for granted may no longer work. When communication breaks
down, all persons involved in a relationship are affected.
Unfortunately, although studies have investigated the impact
of hearing loss on the affected person, minimal data are avail-
able on its effects on the person's family or spouse. Some stud-
ies focus on families with hearing-impaired or deaf children
(Calderon, Bargones, & Sidman, 1998; Lederberg & Everhart,
1998; Nybo, Scherman, & Freeman, 1998). However, if family
members are included in studies of older adults, the focus is

S190
usually on the family member's perception of the impact of
hearing loss on the affected person rather than the family
member. For example, a recent small study (N ¼ 40) showed
that when a significant other was involved in the pre-hearing
aid fitting discussions, patients reported improved hearing aid
benefit in terms of ease of communication and the aversiveness
of sounds (Hoover-Steinwart, English, & Hanley, 2001); data
were not collected on how this process affected the significant
other. Newman and Weinstein (1988) studied the effects of
a hearing aid on elderly hearing-impaired men and their spouses
using the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE)
and the HHIE-SP (spouse version). The reduction in hearing
handicap was greater for the hearing-impaired person than for
the spouse, but the questionnaire asked the spouse to rate her
husband, not herself (e.g., ``Does your spouse feel handicapped
by a hearing problem?''). Similarly, the McCarthy­Alpiner
Scale of Hearing Handicap designed for a family member also
requests information about the hearing-impaired individual (e.g.,
``He gets upset if he cannot hear or understand a conversation'';
McCarthy & Alpiner, 1983). Guides addressing hearing loss
that do discuss family interactions tend to emphasize assisting
the family member to help the hearing-impaired individual join
in or understand. Thus, the impact of one spouse's hearing loss
on the other usually goes unexplored.
One Canadian study did assess the effects of hearing loss on
intimate relationships, but in a working adult sample (He
´tu,
Jones, & Getty, 1993). Most of the article was a theoretical
discussion of the problem, but some descriptive data on inter-
views held with both partners were included. The data highlight
the stress, effort/fatigue, frustration, anger, resentment, and
guilt that are experienced by the unimpaired partner, emphasiz-
ing the importance of interviewing partners as well as the person
with the loss. Yet the authors pointed out that the impact on the
unimpaired partner is rarely acknowledged.
In a recently published study from England, Morgan-Jones
(2001) explored the effects of hearing loss in 11 couples and
five single/divorced individuals. Her findings demonstrate the
importance of the dyadic relationship in the management of
hearing loss but also the potential of the hearing loss to disrupt
this relationship. Several of the older single/divorced partic-
ipants blamed hearing loss for the breakup of their marriages,
and one couple divorced after the interviews were complete.
However, the study is limited in providing an understanding of
hearing loss in older adults and their spouses, because eight
of the couples were young or middle-aged adults (aged 26­47),
and five were married after the hearing loss was established in
the affected individual.
Further supporting the potential effect that hearing loss
in one family member can have on another are data suggest-
ing that treating hearing loss may diminish caregiver burden
(Desbiens, Mueller-Rizner, Virnig, & Lynn, 2001; Palmer,
Adams, Bourgeois, Durrant, & Rossi, 1999). To our knowl-
edge, however, no systematic study has been made of older
husbands and wives where both have been directly assessed.
Further, most studies are cross-sectional and thus limit the as-
sessment of causality.
The purpose of the current study was to analyze the
longitudinal impact of hearing loss experienced by a husband
or wife on the well-being of the respective spouse. Domains of
well-being explored parallel those found to be affected by
hearing loss in hearing-impaired individuals: physical, psycho-
logical, and social. Because gender differences are common in
many aspects of gerontologic research and data suggest that
marriage and relationships have a differential impact on men
and women (Greeff, 2000; Moen, 1996), results are examined
for spouses in general and for husbands and wives specifically.
Findings are discussed in relationship to their implications for
future research, clinical practice, and health policy.
Data are from a longitudinal study of health and well-being
that has a sufficiently large sample size to allow for inclusion
of potential confounding variables, adjustments for paired
data, and statistical significance testing of any observed gender
differences.
Specific research questions were the following: (a) To what
extent does hearing loss in an older spouse affect the physical,
psychological, and social well-being of his or her partner? and
(b) Are any observed effects different for husbands than for
wives?
METHODS
Sample
Designed to assess the longitudinal effects of a wide range
of health behaviors and demographic characteristics on health
and well-being, the Alameda County Study began in 1965 by
enrolling 6,928 residents aged 17­94 selected by means of a
random sample of households (Berkman & Breslow, 1983).
Including the cities of Berkeley and Oakland, Alameda County
was selected partly because its population was typical of other
American urban areas in a variety of ways including age and
ethnicity. Five follow-up surveys were conducted in 1974, 1983,
1994, 1995, and 1999 with response rates of 78­95%. Data for
the analyses reported here were drawn from the 1994 and 1999
surveys.
Because all members of selected households were eligible
to take part in the survey, 72% of those originally enrolled
were married couples. Attrition because of mortality, divorce,
separation, or other loss to follow-up reduced the proportion
of intact couples over the length of the study, but the 1994
and 1999 follow-ups included 852 respondents (426 couples)
who were still married to each other and living together. One or
both members of 8 couples were missing data on hearing loss
or adjustment variables and so were omitted, making the final
sample size 418 couples. Missing data for individual outcome
variables were few (mean ¼ 4.5 couples). Mean age of the hus-
bands and wives in 1994 was 65.4 and 62.8, respectively. Mean
length of marriage was 39.7 years; 88.5% of the husbands
and 89.0% of the wives were in their first marriage.
Measures
Hearing loss and adjustment variables were based on mea-
sures from 1994, with outcome measures based on the 1999
follow-up survey.
Hearing loss. --Hearing loss was self-assessed: Subjects were
asked how much difficulty they had (even with a hearing aid)
hearing and understanding words in a normal conversation,
hearing words clearly over the telephone, and hearing well
enough to carry on a conversation in a noisy room. Response
sets and scores for level of difficulty for each of the three
IMPACT OF HEARING LOSS ON A SPOUSE S191
questions were a great deal (3), some (2), a little (1), or none
(0). Scores were summed. The resulting scale had a range from
0 to 9; higher scores indicate greater hearing loss. In a previous
analysis of Alameda County Study data, this scale predicted
subsequent poor mental health and well-being for subjects with
increased levels of hearing loss (Wallhagen, Strawbridge, &
Kaplan, 2001).
Health and other adjustment variables. --Chronic conditions
included a count of the prevalence in the last 12 months of
11 conditions: arthritis, asthma, bronchitis, cancer, diabetes,
emphysema, heart disease, high blood pressure, osteoporosis,
peripheral artery disease, and stroke. Financial hardship
included any one of the following: not having enough money
in the last 12 months to buy clothing, fill a prescription, see
a doctor, pay rent or mortgage, or (in the last 30 days) buy food.
Outcome Measures
Based on previous data regarding the widespread impact
of hearing loss on the person with a hearing loss, outcome
measures were chosen that assessed three areas of well-being:
physical, psychological, and social.
Physical well-being included energy level, self-rated physical
health, physical disability, and physical frailty. Energy level
was assessed by asking subjects whether they had more or less
energy than most people their age. Responses were coded as (1)
a little or a lot less versus (0) a little or a lot more. Self-rated
physical health was assessed by asking subjects whether their
health was excellent, good, fair, or poor. Responses were coded
as (1) fair or poor versus (0) good or excellent. Physical dis-
ability was assessed using seven variables: getting up from
a stooping, kneeling, or crouching position; lifting or carrying
a weight over 10 lb; pulling or pushing a large object; reaching
or extending arms above the shoulder; standing up after sitting
in a chair; stooping, crouching, or kneeling; and writing or
handling small objects (Nagi, 1976; Rosow & Breslau, 1966).
Those reporting having a lot of difficulty or needing help on
one or more of the items were coded as (1) physically disabled
versus (0) not physically disabled. Physical frailty was assessed
with four questions asking how frequently in the last 12 months
subjects had experienced a sudden loss of balance, weakness
in their legs, weakness in their arms, and dizziness or fainting
when they stood up quickly. Responding often or very often to
any of the items was coded as (1) physically frail versus (0) not
physically frail.
Psychological well-being included depression, self-rated
mental health, negative affect, and happiness. Depression was
measured using the 12 items that operationalize the diagnostic
criteria for a major depressive episode outlined in Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., rev.;
American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Designated the
DSM-12D, the items were adapted from the PRIME-MD mood
disorders section of the manual. Subjects experiencing five
or more symptoms of depression almost every day for the last
2 weeks, including disturbed mood (feeling sad, blue, or
depressed) or anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure in most
things), were coded as (1) experiencing a major depressive
episode versus (0) not experiencing a depressive episode. Self-
rated mental health followed the same format as self-rated
physical health: Responses were coded as (1) fair or poor
versus (0) excellent or good. Negative affect was measured
using the eight-item Bradburn Affect Balance Scale (Bradburn,
1969); those whose negative affect scores were higher than
their positive affect scores were coded as (1) having negative
affect versus (0) not having negative affect. Happiness was
assessed using a single item, coded as (1) not too happy versus
(0) pretty or very happy.
Social well-being was assessed by questions covering four
topics: frequency of going out for entertainment, enjoyment of
free time, feeling close to others, and marital quality. Frequency
of going out for entertainment asked subjects how often they
went out for entertainment, plays, or movies. Responses were
coded as (1) never versus (0) sometimes or often. Enjoyment of
free time asked subjects how much enjoyment they got out of
their free time; responses were coded as (1) not very much or
some versus (0) a lot. Feeling close to others was worded
as ``It's hard for me to feel close to others'' and involved a
true/false format. Coding was (1) true versus (0) false. Marital
quality was measured by a question asking subjects whether
their spouses gave them as much understanding as they needed;
responses were coded as (1) no versus (0) yes but not com-
pletely or yes completely.
Analysis Strategy
Logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of the hear-
ing loss of the spouse measured in 1994 on physical, psycho-
logical, and social well-being of his or her partner as measured in
1999. Each 1999 outcome for the partner was regressed on the
hearing loss score of his or her spouse; covariates included the
partner's age, gender, number of chronic conditions, financial
hardship, and own hearing loss score in 1994.
Analyses of data from couples require special adjustments
because the assumption of independent observations is not met.
Husbands and wives married to each other share more attributes
than would a sample of unrelated husbands and wives. The
generalized estimating equation (GEE) method of Liang and
Zeger (1986) can be used with logistic regression to deal with
the correlations between members of a couple. Therefore, all
logistic regression analyses were conducted using this method.
To first assess the impact of spouses' hearing loss on their
partners' physical, psychological, and social well-being in-
dependent of gender, statistical models were run with gender
included as an adjustment variable. Differences in outcomes
between husbands and wives were then assessed by adding
gender-by-spouse hearing loss interaction terms to each model.
Owing to the reduced power associated with the use of such
interaction terms, a less stringent significance level than .05
may be used to assess the likelihood that interaction is present
(Greenland, 1989). We therefore used a .10 level to assess
statistical significance of tests of gender differences. All other
statistical tests used .05 (two-tailed) significance levels. To
allow both the strength and the precision of the relationships to
be better assessed, results are presented as odds ratios with their
associated 95% confidence intervals. Calculations were per-
formed using SAS software (PROC GENMOD) Version 8.2
(SAS, 1999).
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics are shown separately for husbands
and wives in Table 1. The age range is broad, with over one

third of the husbands and nearly one fourth of the wives aged
70 or older. At follow-up in 1999, all subjects were, of course, 5
years older than the 1994 ages represented in the table. Recent
financial problems were reported by 10% of the husbands and
12% of the wives. Over half of the subjects reported one or
more chronic conditions. Consistent with the national figures
discussed in the introductory section, the men scored higher on
the hearing loss scale than did the women.
Results of the regression analyses are shown in Table 2. The
odds ratios indicate the increased odds of each outcome for the
partner for each 1 point increase in his or her spouse's hear-
ing loss score 5 years earlier. All coefficients are adjusted for
gender, age, financial problems, number of chronic conditions,
and the partner's own hearing loss score.
The first set of results presents the outcomes for partners
regardless of their gender. With the exceptions of two social vari-
ables (never go out for entertainment and not much understand-
ing from spouse), all of the results are statistically significant and
indicate that hearing loss of a spouse predicts poorer physical,
psychological, and social well-being in his or her partner even
when the partner's own hearing loss is taken into account.
The other two sets of odds ratios and associated confidence
intervals in Table 2 present results for husbands based on their
wives' hearing loss and for wives based on their husbands'
hearing loss. All coefficients for the wives are statistically
significant compared with none for the husbands. For un-
derstanding from spouse, the difference in outcomes between
husbands and wives was statistically significant as tested by the
gender interaction test.
DISCUSSION
Limitations of the analyses presented here include the use
of self-assessed measures for hearing loss and the relatively
wide age range of the subjects. Self-report data are useful for
measuring a subject's own sense of hearing loss in the world in
which he or she functions, but validation by and comparison
with audiometric testing would add another dimension. Further,
because there is a wide age range of over 40 years, it would be
useful to use a larger data set to analyze whether the findings
vary across different age cohorts. Given these limitations, these
findings contribute to our current understanding of the impact
of hearing loss on individuals and their spouses.
Previous data demonstrate the negative impact that hearing
loss has on the affected individual. Still, although audiology
texts note the importance of including family in the assessment
and treatment process (Weinstein, 2000), minimal data are
available on the impact of hearing loss on the hearing-impaired
individual's family or spouse. This study begins to address this
gap in our knowledge and demonstrates that the hearing loss of
a spouse impacts the well-being of his or her partner across
a wide range of domains. Further, whereas the odds ratios do
not appear large, each odds ratio is based upon only a 1-point
increase in the spouse's hearing loss score. Although the cur-
rent data do not allow a clear delineation of the mechanisms
by which hearing loss in one partner affects well-being across
such a broad range of domains, some data inform the findings
and suggest areas for future research as well as potential clinical
and policy implications.
As noted earlier, communication is central to the formation
and maintenance of relationships. Greeff (2000) found that the
marital characteristic that was most important to well-function-
ing families was effective communication between spouses.
However, communication usually evolves into a specific pat-
tern or relational schema within any relationship (Koerner &
Fitzpatrick, 2002). Additionally, individuals often have specific
expectations regarding communication with different indi-
viduals and within different settings (termed ``communication
standards'') and can experience discrepancies between these
standards and what actually occurs (Caughlin, 2003). In the
setting of long-term marriages, the onset of hearing loss creates
a need to change potentially long-standing patterns of relating
and can create unmet needs and affect quality of life. Further
research is needed to gain a better understanding of how older
adults negotiate changing roles and relationships in the context
of hearing loss.
Another influencing factor may be the hearing-impaired
individual's own altered well-being. Hearing loss is consistently
found to impact the well-being of the affected individual, and
data suggest that the psychological well-being of a spouse
influences the psychological well-being of his or her partner
(Dufouil & Alpe
´rovitch, 2000; Townsend, Miller, & Guo, 2001).
In addition, if a spouse serves as a confidant, hearing loss alters
the extent to which he or she can fulfill this role. Further,
activities carried out as a couple are potentially constricted; for
example, if the hearing-impaired spouse no longer wants to go
to concerts or plays. This is reflected in the item ``do not enjoy
free time.''
Of additional interest is the finding that although the gender
interaction test identified only one statistically significant

IMPACT OF HEARING LOSS ON A SPOUSE S193
difference between husbands and wives and thus focuses
attention back on the noninteraction models, the gender-specific
results suggest that the findings of the combined models are
driven by the impact of a husband's hearing loss on his wife
rather than on both partners equally. More research is needed to
further support these findings, but data from communication
theory as well as other literature provide a perspective that may
explain the differential impact of hearing loss on a wife and
suggest directions for future investigations.
Communication and relationship needs may differ across the
life span between men and women (Greeff, 2000; Moen, 1996;
White, 1989). Thus, hearing loss may differentially influence
communication, relationships, and well-being in older couples.
Moen (1996) noted that research has shown a curvilinear rela-
tionship between the family's life stage and the perceived marital
quality of both men and women, but that, in general, men often
derive more social and emotional support from within marriage
than do women, who have broader social ties. Greeff (2000)
found that women at several stages in their lives were less
satisfied than men with the type and level of communication in
their marriage.
Acitelli (2002) found that for wives, both marital and life
satisfaction were related to the proportion of time that was spent
talking about the marital relationship; this was not true for
husbands. Both men's and women's relationship talk was
negatively correlated with both partners' depression and
positively correlated with sense of equity in the marriage.
However, for women, relationship talk was also associated with
six additional outcomes including greater satisfaction with the
relationship and feeling cared for in the relationship. Further,
Acitelli (2002) noted that studies have consistently demonstrated
that variables emphasizing the connections between partners are
more important to the well-being and relationship satisfaction of
wives than of husbands.
These data suggest that communication may be more
important for women in marriage than for men. They also
suggest that women may enter a relationship with communica-
tion standards that differ from men. Acitelli (2002) suggested
that men view relational talk as important in problematic
situations and as a means to an end. In contrast, women may feel
that relational talk is an end in and of itself and thus important in
both problematic and normal situations. If communication is
more central to marital and life satisfaction for women,
alterations in the ability to communicate effectively and easily
with a hearing-impaired spouse may have a more detrimental
impact on wives than husbands.
Alternatively, if women value communication more than
men (Garstecki & Erler, 1999), they may be more willing to
acknowledge hearing loss and utilize strategies to minimize
their deficit. Some data do suggest that women are less likely to
return hearing aids than men (Northern & Beyer, 1999). This
would minimize the impact of a woman's hearing loss on her
husband. In addition, several epidemiologic studies found that
whereas men experience greater high frequency loss, women
may exceed men in low frequency loss (1 kHz), although
these differences may be the result of testing artifact (Jerger
et al., 1993; Pearson et al., 1995). If true, these findings could
suggest that men and women may have difficulty hearing in
different settings and may differ in their experience of hearing
loss. However, data regarding the effects of gender on the re-
sponse to hearing loss are not consistent (Erdman & Demorest,
1998), and only minimal data exist addressing any differences
in terms of their implications for outcomes or approaches to care.
Hearing loss is a significant problem for older adults and their
partners, affecting communication and quality of life. To date,
few studies have focused on the partner of the person with
hearing loss, even though it is stressed that interventions should
involve the family. Our data document the impact of an
individual's hearing loss on his or her partner but suggest that
this effect is predominantly on a wife rather than a husband.
Further research is needed in this area to replicate these findings.
To date, much of the literature on communication has occurred
in isolation of the research on aging. Utilizing theoretical
perspectives from communication theory may facilitate an

Notes: Odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (95% CI) are based upon a 1-point increase in the spouse's hearing loss score. All models adjust for age,
gender, financial problems, number of chronic conditions, and hearing loss of the partner. Confidence intervals that do not cross 1.0 are statistically significant at
the .05 level.

understanding of changing relationships with age, especially in
the context of hearing loss. In addition, research using qualitative
methods would contribute to our understanding of the meaning
of hearing loss in older couples, strategies used to deal with
hearing loss, and how they negotiate changes in long established
communication patterns. Further, more research using both
quantitative measures of hearing loss and qualitative assess-
ments is also needed to investigate potential differences in the
experience of hearing loss between men and women. Such data
are needed to better target interventions to the families of
hearing-impaired individuals and to promote the quality of life of
older adults.
Although further research is needed, the findings from the
current study have clinical and policy implications. As noted
earlier, most health care providers pay minimal attention to hear-
ing deficits because they are not immediately life threatening.
Further, when problems are addressed interventions are
generally aimed at the affected person with less attention paid
to family members (Fisher & Weihs, 2000; Moen & Forest,
1995). Prior data demonstrated the impact of hearing loss on the
well-being of older adults; data from the current study
demonstrate that hearing loss has broader implications, affecting
not only the person with hearing loss but also his or her spouse.
This emphasizes the importance of treating hearing loss to
promote the health and well-being of both affected individuals
and their partners.
Addressing hearing loss has other potential clinical ram-
ifications. The management of chronic illness occurs within
the context of the family, and the characteristics of family
relationships can influence disease management (Fisher &
Weihs, 2000). Because hearing loss influences communication
and can affect relationships, improving hearing capacity may
facilitate the management of other chronic conditions. It can
also facilitate communication with health care providers and
promote understanding of treatment strategies. Additional
research is needed to further understand these relationships.
Finally, policy changes are also needed. As Moen and Forest
(1995) noted, whereas policies tend to focus on families in their
childrearing phase, what we need are policies that promote the
effective functioning of families and family members at all
stages of life. Currently, Medicare and most other insurance
policies do not cover the cost of routine hearing evaluations or
hearing aids, and Medicaid limits who is eligible and covers
only one aid. These policies ignore the wide-ranging impact of
hearing loss and are not designed to assist families with chang-
ing communication needs across the life span. More data are
needed on the cost implications of not providing the resources
necessary to facilitate communication.
In summary, hearing loss has a significant effect not only on
older adults but also on their spouses. Because altered com-
munication affects a broad range of daily activities, policies and
interventions designed to enhance hearing capacity and promote
effective communication strategies may have an important effect
on the well-being of older adults and their partners.
