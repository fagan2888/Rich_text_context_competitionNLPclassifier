Introduction
In contrast to Britain, Germany has often been portrayed as
an ethnically exclusivist nation (Brubaker, 1992; Greenfeld,
1992; Ignatieff, 1994), roughly along the lines of "classic"
distinctions into civic (Western) and ethnic (Eastern) forms
of nationalism (Kohn, 1961; Plamenatz, 1976). Within this
framework, ethnic nations (of which Germany is frequently
cited as a prime example) are supposed to be built around
anachronistic notions of ethno-ancestral communities,
whereas civic nations are seen as having (more or less
miraculously) evolved around ideas of individual rights and
democratic principles (such as in the case of Britain).
At the time of their invention during the Cold War, such
distinctions may have offered some intuitive solace in reduc-
ing the complexity of national phenomena around the world
to a simple and clear-cut dichotomy--to a binary set of labels
for whole nations and societies. In the course of intensifying
processes of economic and cultural globalization, however,
the civic­ethnic dichotomy lost much of its previously
appealing touch. To further shatter an already feeble concep-
tual construction, various scholarly critiques have convinc-
ingly demonstrated that Hans Kohn's original idea of
distinctively civic (Western) nations and distinctively ethnic
(Eastern) nations can neither be sustained on theoretical nor
empirico-historical grounds (e.g., Hansen & Hesli, 2009;
Joppke, 2003; Kuzio, 2002; Nieguth, 1999; Shulman, 2002).
Arguably, the point to be taken from such criticism is not
necessarily to categorically refute all analytical references
to civic and ethnic dimensions in studies of national
phenomena (e.g., people's national identities or the [re]
invention of national myths) but to appreciate that in an
increasingly interconnected world, whole nations and
national populations cannot be meaningfully conceived in
terms of monolithic agglomerates of either the civic or the
ethnic type.
Around the globe, public opinion on different national
phenomena varies within as much as across different coun-
tries and depending on people's individual experiences and
perceptions, and more often than not legal definitions of
national membership are subject to change over time. The
present article aims to support this line of argument, with a
particular interest in associations between people's level of
formal education and their evaluations of ancestry as marker
of Britishness/Germanness.
Ancestry as Marker of National
Membership
In today's world, it is not at all unusual to hear of people

Locating Ancestry in Notions of Britishness/
Germanness: Beyond Waning Myths of Civic
and Ethnic Nations
Andreas Pöllmann1
Abstract
This article focuses on ancestry as a controversial marker of Britishness/Germanness.Considering developments in nationality
law and large-scale survey data for England and Germany, it illustrates that macrocontextual distinctions into civic and ethnic
nations tend to overestimate cross-national differences,while underestimating important within-country variations according
to people's educational background. The fact that--in both countries--higher levels of formal education are strongly
associated with more ethnically inclusive notions of legitimate national membership underlines the formative potential of
formal education in contemporary multicultural societies.

and [whose] children are growing up and are being educated
internationally" (Beck, 2002, p. 31). Through personal expe-
riences of (voluntary or forced) migration, people can come
to love and respect a country other than their parents' country
of origin, with a strong sense of belonging and the desire for
active citizenship. They can learn new societal rules and regu-
lations--even to converse in a new language. Their ancestral
background, however, might be "concealed but never realisti-
cally wished away or `undone'" (Bauman, 2004, p. 60). It is
in this sense that ancestry constitutes an exclusivist criterion
for national membership that fails to do justice to the complex
realities of contemporary multicultural societies.
The question as to whether ethnic components are vital
"to forge a `nation' today" (Smith, 1986, p. 17) evokes much
debate. Ontologically speaking, ethno-national communities
are imagined (Anderson, 2006). As symbolical constructs
(Cohen, 1985), they rely on a myth of common ancestry
(Smith, 1993) rather than on historically indisputable factual
accounts. But even if there is good reason to conceive ances-
try as a flawed (and unnecessarily divisive) criterion for
national membership (Eller & Coughlan, 1993; Habermas,
1992; Kymlicka, 1998; Parekh, 2006), the potential appeal
of ethno-national bonds can hardly be denied (Barth, 1969;
Debeljak, 2003; Smith, 2004).
In people's perceptions, ideas of "ethno-national bonds"
or a "shared ancestry" may well be mistaken for "historical
truths" rather than recognized as socially constructed mythol-
ogy, or to quote Connor (1993),
The sense of unique descent, of course, need not, and
in nearly all cases will not, accord with factual history.
Nearly all nations are the variegated offspring of
numerous ethnic strains. It is not chronological or
factual history that is the key to the nation, but sentient
or felt history. All that is irreducibly required for the
existence of a nation is that the members share an
intuitive conviction of the group's separate origin and
evolution. (p. 382, italics in original)
Consequently, people's notions of legitimate national
membership can differ significantly from official definitions
and laws. Their subjective realities and felt identities do not
need to converge with preestablished ethnic categories or
labels (Jamieson, 2002). A census, for example, may "fit"
people into particular categories (e.g., "British" or
"German"), but this does not mean that people actually iden-
tify themselves or others with these categories (Herrmann &
Brewer, 2004).
The subsequent discussion focuses, therefore, not only on
legal definitions of Britishness/Germanness but also on peo-
ple's perceptions1--on whether and to what extent they con-
sider ancestry as an important criterion for legitimate
national membership. To begin with, however, let us take a
look at some recent developments in British and German
nationality law.
Developments in British and
German Nationality Law
Non-British residents in Britain have long faced compara-
tively fewer legal and cultural barriers on the way to full
citizenship status and recognition than non-German resi-
dents in Germany (De Wit & Koopmans, 2005; Piper, 1998).
In the late 1980s, for instance, immigrants to Britain had to
wait only half as long for permanent residency status as
(nonethnic German) immigrants to Germany (Soysal, 1994).
Not surprisingly thus, the naturalization rate in Germany has
been comparatively low (Green, 2003).
Germany's 1913 Citizenship Act has been characterized
as a "system of pure jus sanguinis[2], with no trace of jus
soli[3], [which] continues to determine the citizenship status
of immigrants and their descendants" (Brubaker, 1992,
p. 165). Ignatieff (1994) paints a similarly bleak picture
when reflecting upon his personal travel experiences in
reunified Germany:
The criterion of citizenship remains one of ethnic
descent on the basis of jus sanguinis. . . . To most
outsiders, and to many Germans, it seems absurd that
a Turk, born and brought up in Germany, should be
unable to become a citizen, while a German from
Siberia, with no history of residence in the country
and little language competence, should be entitled
to citizenship and to extensive settlement assistance.
(p. 76, italics in original)
It is right to draw attention to jus sanguinis--a long-
established marker of German nationality that entails
significant privileges for ethnic Germans--most notably
the immediate entitlement to full citizenship (Brubaker,
1992, 1998; Koopmans, 1999).
The legal foundations of German identity, however, do
not--as Ignatieff (1994) suggests--"remain defined by the
ethnic nationalist past" (p. 76). Following German reunifica-
tion, a series of legal reforms (1990, 1993, 1999) "aimed to
limit the discretionary power of officials in naturalization
and to provide foreigners a legal right to claim entitlement to
naturalization" (Anil, 2005, p. 455).4 In summer 2010, dur-
ing the FIFA World Cup in South Africa, football enthusiasts
around the globe could witness "real-life-effects" of these
reforms in form of a multiethnic German national team--a
rather unlikely scenario until relatively recently.
Whereas late 20th-century developments in German
nationality law have (re)established jus soli alongside jus
sanguinis, major amendments to British citizenship legisla-
tion appear to have followed a reverse trajectory (Cesarani,
1996; Layton-Henry, 2003). Safran (1997) illustrates this
point well:
Before the coming into force of the British Nationality
Act of 1981, jus soli was applied to individuals,
Pöllmann 3
regardless of their ancestry, born in the United
Kingdom or in a British crown colony. But since then,
British citizenship has been accorded predominantly
on the basis of jus sanguinis, whether or not the child
is born in the United Kingdom. (p. 324, italics in
original)
These gradual developments toward increasing cross-
national similarities in nationality law coincided with broader
sociopolitical trends. Although in the late 1950s, the political
culture in Germany (FRG) could plausibly be described as
comparatively less "civic" than in Britain (Almond & Verba,
1963), such descriptions subsequently (by the late 1970s)
lost their empirical basis and, consequently, their conceptual
raison d'être (Conradt, 1989; Kavanagh, 1989).
Simple binary distinctions into civic and ethnic nations
would not only misrepresent legal realities and sociopolitical
trends in 21st-century multicultural societies such as Britain
and Germany, but in evoking ideas of a "general national
character", they would also distort the fact that different
people--within and across different countries--ascribe
different degrees of importance to markers of national mem-
bership. To illustrate this central point, the following section
focuses on people's perceptions, drawing on representative
survey data for England5 and Germany.
Public Opinion in England and Germany
This section reports results from the International Social
Survey Programme (ISSP) 2003. The ISSP 2003 comprises
a series of questions on national consciousness and national
identity and covers various countries around the globe,
including England and Germany. The respective data were
collected between February 2003 and January 2005.
General Population Samples
Table 1 lists the different levels of importance that ISSP
2003 respondents in England and Germany attribute to
ancestry in terms of what they think it means to be "truly"
British/German.6
As quickly becomes evident, the respective survey data
hardly serve to support notions of a distinctively ethnic
German nation. In both England and Germany, slightly more
than 48% of respondents ascribe little or no significance to
ancestry as marker of national membership. The respective
results for England and Germany differ on some answer cat-
egories ("fairly important" and "very important") and are
close to identical on others ("not very important" and "not
important at all")--with no consistent trend of cross-national
divergence.
Althoughformanypeople--inEnglandandinGermany--
ancestry does not appear to constitute an important criterion
for national membership, Table 1 also shows that slightly
more than every second respondent does indeed consider
ancestral ties as fairly or very important in terms of what he
or she thinks it means to be "truly" British/German. Before
getting back to this finding in the concluding section, it will
be interesting to see to what extent the respective results vary
according to respondents' level of formal education.
Public Opinion by Respondents' Level of
Formal Education
Institutions of formal education play an important part in
the formation of national identities (Bernstein, 1996;
Dewey, 1963; Gellner, 1983; Hobsbawm, 1992). They can
promote intercultural encounters and global learning, while
challenging antiforeigner sentiment, national stereotypes,
and racial prejudice (Byram, 2003; Luchtenberg, 2007;
Pöllmann, 2009). Across different national contexts, higher
levels of formal education have been shown to correlate
with lower levels of ethnic exclusionism, nationalism, and
xenophobia (Coenders & Scheepers, 2003; Hjerm, 2001;
Van Peer, 2006).
To examine associations between people's educational
background and the importance that they ascribe to ancestry
as marker of national membership, let us now compare sub-
samples of respondents with comparatively low and com-
paratively high levels of formal education. For the purposes
of this article, I define those ISSP 2003 respondents who
classified their level of formal education within one of the
following categories as having a high level of formal educa-
tion: "higher secondary completed," or "above higher sec-
ondary level," or "university degree completed."
Furthermore, I regard those respondents who classified their
level of formal education within one of the following cate-
gories as having a low level of formal education: "no formal
qualification," or "lowest formal qualification," or "above
lowest."7
Table 2 shows significant variations in people's percep-
tions of ancestry as marker of Britishness/Germanness
depending on their level of formal education.
In England as well as in Germany, respondents with com-
paratively high levels of formal education are significantly
less likely to regard ancestry as important in terms of what
they think it means to be "truly" British/German. Lower lev-
els of formal education, however, are strongly associated

with perceptions of ancestry as a key marker of national
membership. The proportion of those who perceive ancestry
as "very important," for example, increases in England from
16.3% among respondents with comparatively high levels of
formal education to 40.4% among respondents with com-
paratively low levels of formal education--and in Germany
(by a virtually identical factor) from a proportion of 10.2% to
a share of 24.4%.
Notwithstanding the fact that a multivariate statistical
analysis would do more justice to the complexity of people's
personal characteristics, experiences, and perceptions, the
cross-national comparisons in Tables 1 and 2 serve to illus-
trate that macrocontextual distinctions into civic and ethnic
nations tend to overestimate cross-national differences,
while underestimating important within-country variations
according to people's level of formal education.
Conclusion
In contrast to Britain, Germany has long been seen as a
"classic" example of an ethnically exclusivist nation.
Accordingly, it would have been plausible to find a perva-
sive emphasis on ancestry as marker of Germanness in
public opinion and nationality law. Yet, neither large-scale
survey data nor legal provisions confirm this expectation. If
anything, public opinion in Germany seems to reflect recent
developments toward more ethnically inclusive legal defini-
tions of Germanness.
As a matter of fact, respondents in Germany do not tend
to ascribe more importance to ancestry as marker of
national membership than respondents in England. While
the respective ISSP data reveal only minor cross-national
variations in public opinion (see Table 1), they do provide
conclusive evidence that--in both countries--respondents
with comparatively high levels of formal education are sig-
nificantly less likely to regard ancestry as important in
terms of what they think it means to be "truly" British/
German (see Table 2).
However, even if in the eyes of many respondents--
particularly the comparatively "more educated"--ancestry
does not seem to constitute an important criterion for national
membership, the respective survey data also demonstrate
that a majority (albeit a narrow one) does indeed consider
ancestral ties as fairly or very important.
Based on a simple answer to a survey question, it would, of
course, be inadequate to stigmatize respondents who ascribe a
high importance to ancestral ties as (potential) racists or xeno-
phobes.And yet, the respective results cannot be entirely sepa-
rated from the fact that ethnocentrism, racism, and xenophobia
are alive and well in contemporary multicultural societies--
including Britain and Germany (Chakraborti & Garland,
2004; Cole, 2009; Kühnel, 2003; Wieviorka, 2010). All too
easily, the perceived right to national membership can be
grounded in exclusionary notions of a "shared ancestry"--
often paired with an emphasis on what Weber (1968) calls the
"esthetically conspicuous differences of the physical appear-
ance" (p. 390)--skin color being a pertinent example.
In a time of increasing global interconnectedness, with
soaring levels of international migration across ethno-cul-
tural boundaries, research on civic and ethnic dimensions in
people's notions of legitimate national membership--of
what they think it means to be "truly" British, German,
Chinese, Indian, Russian, or Mexican--deserves a sustained
academic interest. International comparative research on the
explanatory impact of people's educational background
seems particularly promising in this context. In any case,
however, future research can do without crude distinctions
into civic and ethnic nations.

Notes
1. On the importance of people's perceptions in studies of
national identities, see for instance, Brubaker (2006), Reicher
and Hopkins (2001), and Shulman (2002). Pöllmann (2008)--
to give a more closely related example--shows how levels of
national attachment can vary depending on subjective notions
of legitimate national membership.
 2. "[Latin: law relating to blood] The principle that the national-
ity of children is the same as that of their parents, irrespective
of their place of birth" (Martin & Law, 2006, p. 300).
 3. "[Latin: law relating to the soil (of one's country)] The rule by
which birth in a state is sufficient to confer nationality, irre-
spective of the nationality of one's parents" (Martin & Law,
2006, p. 301).
 4. Moreover, since January 1, 2000, "a person born in Germany
to a foreign parent, who has resided in Germany lawfully for
8 years or has held an unlimited residency permit for at least
3 years, would automatically be granted German citizenship"
(Anil, 2005, p. 454). See Nathans (2004) for a comprehen-
sive historical analysis of developments in German citizenship
laws and policies.
 5. The population of England accounts for more than 80% of the
total population of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland (Office for National Statistics, 2010).
6. The respective question reads, "Some people say that the
following things are important for being truly [British/Ger-
man]. Others say they are not important. How important do
you think each of the following is"[:] "To have been born in
[Britain/Germany]"; "to have [British/German] citizenship";
"to have lived in [Britain/Germany] for most of one's life";
"to be able to speak [English/German]"; "to be Christian";
"to respect [British/German] political institutions and laws";
"to feel [British/German]"; "to have [British/German] ances-
try". [Main answer categories:] "Not important at all"; "not
very important"; "fairly important"; "very important" (italics
added). For more details, see ISSP (2003).
7. The full list of educational categories includes an additional
item "other education (CH)." However, the number of cases
in this category is negligible (i.e., less than 0.1%). For further
details, see ISSP (2003).
