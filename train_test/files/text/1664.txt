OBJECTIVE -- The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and correlates of
elevated A1C in a large, nationally representative sample of adults without diabetes in the U.S.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We analyzed data from 15,934
participants aged 20 years without diagnosed diabetes who had A1C measurements
in the 1999­2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-
sectional and nationally representative sample of the U.S. population.
RESULTS -- The overall prevalence of A1C 6% was 3.8%, corresponding to 7.1
million adults without diabetes in the U.S. population. Approximately 90% of these
individuals had fasting glucose 100 mg/dl. Older age, male sex, non-Hispanic black
race/ethnicity, hypercholesterolemia, higher BMI, and lower attained education were
significantly associated with having a higher A1C level even among individuals with
normal fasting glucose (100 mg/dl) and after multivariable adjustment.
CONCLUSIONS -- A single elevated A1C level (A1C 6%) is common in the
general population of adults without a history of diabetes and is highly reliable for the
detection of elevated fasting glucose. Nondiabetic adults with elevated A1C are likely to
have impaired fasting glucose and an array of other risk factors for type 2 diabetes and
cardiovascular disease.

A1C is an integrated measure of circu-
latingglucoselevelsandtrackswellin
individuals over time. Epidemiologi-
cal studies have shown that A1C values in
nondiabeticadultspredictincidentdiabetes
(1­5),cardiovasculardiseasemorbidityand
mortality (6­10), and total mortality (7). In
these studies, A1C values well within in the
"normal" range (i.e., A1C 6%) were inde-
pendently associated with clinical out-
comes. There is currently renewed interest
in using A1C for diagnosis and/or screening
for diabetes (11); however, there have been
few epidemiological investigations of A1C
in nondiabetic adults. The objective of the
present study was to examine the preva-
lence and correlates of elevated A1C in a
large, nationally representative sample of
U.S.adultswithoutdiagnoseddiabeteswho
participated in the National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey (NHANES)
(1999­2006). We hypothesized that 1) el-
evated A1C levels (e.g., A1C 6%) are
common in the general population of non-
diabetic adults in the U.S. and 2) A1C levels
would be associated with risk factors for
type 2 diabetes and its complications even
in the absence of elevated glucose levels.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- NHANES is an ongoing
cross-sectional, multistage, stratified,
clustered probability sample of the U.S.
civilian noninstitutionalized population
conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS), a branch of the
Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (12). Detailed in-person interviews,
physical examinations, and blood sam-
ples were obtained from 18,986 partici-
pants aged 20 years in the 1999­2006
surveys who participated in the mobile
examination visit. For the present study,
we excluded those individuals who re-
ported that a doctor or health care profes-
sion had ever told them they had diabetes
(n  1,900), who were missing informa-
tion on diabetes status (n  288), or who
were missing A1C data (n  986). The
protocols of conduct for NHANES were
approved by the NCHS institutional re-
view board, and informed consent was
obtained from all participants.
Fasting plasma glucose subsample
Approximately one-half of NHANES par-
ticipants were sampled to attend the
morning session. These participants were
instructed to fast at least 9 hours before
the appointment time. Fasting plasma
glucose (FPG) values are available for
those adults aged 20 years who at-
tended the morning examination and
were fasting for 8 h (n  9,232). Our
analyses of fasting glucose were limited to
the fasting subpopulation of adults with-
out diabetes who were not missing A1C
data (n  7,772). In the plasma glucose
fasting subsample, we conducted analy-
ses comparing A1C levels among individ-
uals with normal fasting glucose (100
mg/dl), impaired fasting glucose (IFG)
(100­126 mg/dl), and undiagnosed di-
abetes (fasting glucose 126 mg/dl) (13).
In the 2005­2006 survey, an oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT) was added to the
laboratory protocol. Thus, OGTT data
were available for participants in the
morning fasting subsample in the 2005­
2006 survey only.
Laboratory measurement of A1C and
plasma glucose
A1C measurements for NHANES 1999­
2004 were performed by the Diabetes Di-
agnostic Laboratory at the University of
Missouri-Columbia using Primus
CLC330 and Primus CLC 385 instru-
ments (Primus, Kansas City, MO). A1C
measurements in NHANES 2005­2006

were performed by the Diabetes Labora-
tory at the University of Minnesota using a
Tosoh A1c 2.2 Plus Glycohemoglobin
Analyzer (Tosoh Medics, San Francisco,
CA). Both assays use a high-performance
liquid chromatography system (14). All
A1C measurements were standardized
to the reference method used for the
Diabetes Control and Complications
Trial. The plasma glucose concentration
was determined by a hexokinase enzy-
matic method (15).
Other variables of interest
The NHANES examination included
measurement of height, weight, and
blood pressure. Hypertension was de-
fined as a mean systolic blood pressure of
140 mmHg, a mean diastolic blood
pressure of 90 mmHg, or hypertension
medication use. Total cholesterol was
measured enzymatically. Hypercholester-
olemia was defined as a total cholesterol
level of 240 mg/dl or lipid medication
use. C-reactive protein was measured by
latex-enhanced nephelometry, a high-
sensitivity assay. Information on age, sex,
race/ethnicity, education level, and smok-
ing was based on self-report during the
questionnaire portion of the survey. A
history of cardiovascular disease was de-
fined on the basis of a self-reported his-
tory of coronary heart disease, angina,
previous heart attack, or stroke. Smoking
status was determined using answers to
the questions, "Have you smoked at least
100 cigarettes in your life?" and "Do you
now smoke cigarettes?" Alcohol con-
sumption was determined during the
computer-assisted personal interview us-
ing answers to the questions, "In any one
year, have you had at least 12 drinks of
any type of alcoholic beverage?" and "In
your entire life, have you had at least 12
drinks of any type of alcoholic beverage?"
Detailed information regarding the col-
lection of data in NHANES is available
elsewhere (12).
Statistical analysis
Analyses were performed incorporating
the sampling weights (8-year combined
weights) to obtain unbiased estimates
from the complex NHANES sampling de-
sign using StataSE (version 10.0; Stata-
Corporation, College Station, TX) and R
(version 2; Free Software Foundation,
Boston, MA). SEs for all estimates were
obtained using the Taylor series (linear-
ization) method following NCHS-
recommended procedures (16). Analyses
of FPG categories were limited to the
morning plasma glucose sample and cor-
responding 8-year fasting subsample
weights were used for these analyses. We
generated weighted and smoothed histo-
grams (kernel density estimator) to com-
pare the distribution of A1C in individuals
with normal fasting glucose, IFG, and undi-
agnosed diabetes.
For the purposes of this study, we de-
fined "elevated A1C" as A1C 6% in this
population without a history of diabetes.
However, we also assessed the prevalence
of elevated A1C at cut points of 6.0, 6.1,
6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, and
7.0%. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and
their corresponding 95% CIs were esti-
mated from logistic regression models to
assess the association between potential
risk factors and elevated A1C levels. We
conducted multivariable logistic analyses
modeling A1C 6% as the outcome in
the overall population. In the population
of adults with normal A1C (6%) and
normal fasting glucose (100 mg/dl) lev-
els, we modeled the association between
risk factors of interest and A1C level
above the weighted median A1C level in
this population (5.2%). Model 1 in-
cluded age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Model
2 included all variables in model 1 plus
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
BMI, education, history of cardiovascular
disease, alcohol consumption, and C-re-
active protein categories. Sensitivity anal-
yses were conducting using the OGTT
data only available in NHANES 2005­
2006 and the appropriate 2-year fasting
weights for this survey.
Estimates from this study are nation-
ally representative of the noninstitution-
alized population of adults 20 years in
the U.S. Prevalence estimates were ap-
plied to the 2000 U.S. Census to obtain
estimates of the number of nondiabetic
individuals with elevated A1C in the U.S.
in the year 2000.
RESULTS -- Mean A1C level and pro-
portion of individuals with elevated A1C
(A1C 6%) by population characteristics
are displayed in Table 1. The mean  SE
A1C in adults aged 20 years without
diagnosed diabetes was 5.3  0.01%.
Mean A1C level and the proportion of in-
dividuals with A1C 6% increased con-
siderably with age. Non-Hispanic blacks
also had higher A1C levels than non-
Hispanic whites. In this crude comparison,
differences in A1C were also observed for
hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
status, BMI categories, education level, and
C-reactive protein quartiles.
Figure 1 displays the count of indi-
viduals (in millions) with elevated A1C at
cut points between 6.0 and 7.0%. The
prevalence of A1C 6.0% in individuals
without a history of diabetes was 3.8%
(95% CI 3.5­4.2) (Table 1), correspond-
ing to 7.1 million adults (6.5­7.8) in the
U.S (Fig. 1). The prevalence estimates for
A1C cut points of 6.1, 6.5, and
7.0% were 2.9 (2.6­3.2), 1.6 (1.4­
1.8), and 0.8 (0.6­0.9). These corre-
spond to 5.4 million (4.8 ­ 6.0), 3.0
million (2.6­3.3), and 1.5 million (1.1­
1.7) individuals in the U.S. population,
respectively. These prevalence estimates
suggest the yield of individuals in the U.S.
with elevated A1C at different cut points if
A1C alone was used to screen for diabetes.
Figure 2 displays the distributions of
A1C in individuals with normal fasting
glucose (fasting glucose 100 mg/dl),
IFG (fasting glucose 100­126 mg/dl),
and undiagnosed diabetes (fasting glu-
cose 126 mg/dl), revealing substantially
overlapping distributions in individuals
with normal glucose and IFG but a right-
skewed distribution in individuals with
undiagnosed diabetes. The mean A1C
levels in individuals with normal fasting
glucose, IFG, and undiagnosed diabetes
were 5.2  0.01, 5.5  0.01, and 6.9 
0.16%, respectively (not shown). Simi-
larly, the distribution of individuals in the
fasting glucose categories (100, 100­
125, and 126 mg/dl) varied substan-
tially, depending on the A1C cut point.
For instance, among individuals with
A1C 6.0%, 45.6% had undiagnosed di-
abetes, 45.3% had IFG, and 9.1% had
normal fasting glucose. In contrast,
among individuals with an A1C 7.0%,
91.7% had undiagnosed diabetes, 6.6%
had IFG, and only 1.7% had normal glu-
cose levels. A comparison of the distribu-
tion of fasting glucose categories among
individuals with A1C 6.1% and A1C
6.5% yielded intermediate results.
Among individuals with A1C 6%,
53.3% had undiagnosed diabetes, 38.6%
had IFG, and 8.1% had normal fasting
glucose. Among individuals with A1C
6.5%, 76.7% had undiagnosed diabetes,
19.6% had IFG, and 1.7% had normal fast-
ing glucose (supplementary Figure A, avail-
able in an online appendix at http://care.

cation, and higher C-reactive protein lev-
els were all associated with the prevalence
of elevated A1C (A1C 6%) even after
multivariable adjustment in this popula-
tion of adults without diagnosed diabetes
(supplementary Table A). Current alco-
hol consumption was associated with
lower A1C. We next examined the same
variables but limited the population to in-
dividuals with normal A1C (A1C 6%)
and with a fasting glucose 100 mg/dl
and assessed the association with having
an A1C level above the median in this
population (A1C 5.2%) (Table 2). Sim-
ilar associations as in the model of A1C
6% were observed in the full popula-
tion. In Table 2, older age, male sex, non-
Hispanic black and Mexican-American
race/ethnicity, hypercholesterolemia,
higher BMI, and lower attained education
were significantly associated with having
a higher A1C level, even after adjustment.
Current smoking was associated with
higher A1C and current alcohol con-
sumption with lower A1C in this popula-
tion with normal glucose levels.
Additional adjustment for fasting glucose
did not alter these results (data not
shown). Our results were also unchanged
in sensitivity analyses of NHANES 2005­
2006, the only years for which OGTT data
were available, in which we further ex-
cluded individuals with impaired glucose
tolerance (2-h glucose 140 mg/dl) from
our multivariable models (data not
shown).
CONCLUSIONS -- This analysis
suggests that elevated A1C (6%) is com-
mon in the general population of nondi-
abetic adults. The overall prevalence of
A1C 6% was 3.8%, corresponding to
7.1 million individuals in the U.S. popu-
lation. Approximately 45% of these indi-
viduals have IFG and 45% have fasting
glucose 126 mg/dl. Elevated A1C levels
were particularly common among older
adults, non-Hispanic blacks, and obese
individuals. We found that demographic
characteristics and risk factors for type 2
diabetes and its complications including
older age, male sex, nonwhite race/
ethnicity, lower attained education level,
adiposity, and hypercholesterolemia were
associated with elevated A1C even in the
presence of normal fasting glucose.
Significant advantages of adopting A1C
for the screening and diagnosis of diabetes
are the high repeatability of the measure-
ment (17,18) and the high specificity of el-
evated values for detecting undiagnosed
diabetes (19­21). Recent recommenda-
tions have stated that diagnosis based on
A1C should be confirmed using a glucose-
dependent test (FPG or OGTT) or by a
second A1C (11). However, glucose-
dependent tests are less reliable (repeatable)
than A1C (17). Requiring confirmation of a
highly reliable test by one that is less reliable
poses problems for the interpretation of any
discrepancy between the two values. In a
previous study, we analyzed repeated mea-
surements taken 2 weeks apart on an un-
selected sample of individuals without
diabetes and found that 100% of individu-
als with A1C 7% had a second A1C mea-
surement of 7% 2 weeks later and 80%
of individuals with A1C 6.5 had an A1C
level 6.5% 2 weeks later (Pearson's r 
0.95) (17). There is little marginal gain to
repeating the A1C test within a short (sev-
eral week) time period. Furthermore, we
show in the present study that 92% of indi-
viduals with A1C 7.0% also had FPG
126 mg/dl and 77% of individuals with

A1C 6.5% had FPG 126 mg/dl. At the
population level, elevated A1C is rare in the
absence of elevated fasting glucose. Addi-
tional advantages to using A1C for screen-
ing and/or diagnosis of diabetes include
national standardization of the assay
(22,23), the low analytic variability (high
methodological quality of the assay, even
when compared with glucose) (24), the
widespread availability of the A1C test and
itscurrentuseinthemanagementandtreat-
ment of diabetes, and the fact that the pa-
tient does not need to fast.
It is unclear why nondiabetic non-
Hispanic blacks have consistently higher
A1C values even in the setting of normal
fasting glucose levels and after adjustment
for demographic and clinical characteris-
tics. Further research should be con-
ducted to determine whether this
disparity stems from racial differences in
postprandial glycemia or from racial dif-
ferences in the tendency of hemoglobin to
undergo glycosylation.
This study has several strengths includ-
ing the large, nationally representative sam-
ple of healthy, nondiabetic individuals. We
benefited from the rigorous measurement
of risk factors using standardized protocols
andstrictqualitycontroldatacollectionand
laboratory procedures in NHANES. Impor-
tant limitations include the cross-sectional
design, which limits our conclusions re-
garding the temporality of the observed as-
sociations. In addition, we had only a single
measurement of fasting glucose. The Amer-
ican Diabetes Association recommends re-
peating an elevated fasting glucose
measurement to confirm the diagnosis of
diabetes (13). The use of a single measure-
ment of fasting glucose rather than two will
overestimatetheprevalenceofundiagnosed
diabetes (17). Nonetheless, interpretation
of single measurements of fasting glucose
and A1C as analyzed in this study re-
flects a common clinical decision-
making setting. Although we cannot
rule out the possibility of laboratory dif-
ferences over time, calibration of A1C to
account for the change in laboratories in
2005­2006 using a published equation
(14) did not appreciably alter our re-
sults. The lack of OGTT data in the fast-
ing glucose subsample for all survey
years is an important limitation of this
study. Nonetheless, similar results were
obtained in multivariable models using
the OGTT measurements in the sub-
group from the 2005­2006 NHANES.
To date, the diagnostic utility of A1C
has largely been assessed by its accuracy
(as measured by its sensitivity and speci-
ficity) to detect glucose-defined cases of
diabetes (25). The concordance of A1C
with fasting glucose is important and, as
confirmed by our data, an A1C 6.5% is
specific for the detection of undiagnosed
diabetes defined by a single fasting glu-
cose level. Thus, it seems reasonable to
adopt a single elevated A1C value as being
diagnostic for diabetes. However, the real
test of utility for A1C as a screening or

diagnostic test of diabetes is its association
with long-term clinical outcomes in an
initially nondiabetic population specifi-
cally in comparison with fasting glucose
levels. To address this question we need
large, observational studies of A1C
in populations of individuals without
diabetes.
