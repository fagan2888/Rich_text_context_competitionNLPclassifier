Objective: The objective of this study was to assess associations
between socioeconomic status (SES) and adolescent sexually transmit-
ted diseases (STDs) stratified by race and gender.
Study: In cross-sectional analyses of the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health Wave One (1995), unadjusted and ad-
justed associations between 4 family SES indicators and STD reports
for black and white 7th through 12th graders were examined.
Results: Lower maternal education and nonprofessional maternal
occupations were associated with higher STD reports in all groups
except white females. Generally, STD reports were higher for adoles-
cents not living in 2-parent homes, and lower income was only asso-
ciated for black males.
Conclusion: Overall, SES is only a weak to moderate marker for
adolescent STD risks. The relationship of SES and STDs varies by the
SES measure used and differs across race­gender groups. Other
individual factors such as risk behaviors or community factors such as
income inequality could play a more critical role for adolescent STDs
than family SES.
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES (STDs) are prevalent
among adolescents between 15 and 20 years old in the United
States.1,2 Racial and gender disparities in STDs still exist between
groups of adolescents. In 2001, the reported number of chlamydial
infections, gonorrhea, and primary and secondary syphilis for
black females were 3.5 times that of black males, 2 times that of
white females, and 16 times that of white males.3
Beyond identification of racial and gender disparities in adoles-
cent STD outcomes,4,5 few studies have considered factors related
to these differences. Socioeconomic status (SES) has been as-
sessed in relation to racial disparities in self-reported STDs in the
Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) and gonor-
rhea or chlamydial infections rates among 12 to 20 year olds in San
Francisco.6,7 In the YRBSS, black­white differences in reported
STDs actually increased after adjustment for parental education,
family income, and regional location.7 In San Francisco, racial
differences in gonorrhea rates decreased with declining neighbor-
hood SES, but disparities in chlamydial infections were not con-
sistently affected by neighborhood SES.6
Direct statistical comparisons of adjusted risks in racial/ethnic
or gender groups have been criticized because the exchangeability
conditions that give adjusted estimates their interpretability are
hard to justify in substantive terms.8­10 In these comparisons,
black is the exposed group and white is the unexposed group,
although this counterfactual cannot be justified as a result of the
practical impossibility of conditioning on a sufficient number or
type of measured variables. Statistical comparisons of adjusted
risks in racial/ethnic groups remain problematic even when con-
sidering only a single aspect in these comparisons. For example,
when racial comparisons are adjusted for SES, residual associa-
tions between race and social position persist after adjustment
because measured SES quantities are an incomplete representation
of true social position and its many correlates.8,11,12 Stratification
by race/ethnicity and gender has been suggested as one way to
consider differences between groups while avoiding problems of

direct statistical comparisons that would require unreasonable as-
sumptions.13
In this study, we assessed associations between indicators of
family SES and self-reported STD outcomes stratified by race and
gender. SES was measured by 4 different indicators: maternal
educational attainment, maternal occupation, household composi-
tion, and adjusted household income. We hypothesized that family
SES markers would differ by race and gender and that income
would be a relatively weak marker, particularly among blacks.
These analyses were performed on black and white adolescents
between the ages of 12 and 21 participating in the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) Wave 1
(1995).
Materials and Methods
The design and methods for Add Health have been described
previously.14 Briefly, Add Health is a longitudinal study of a
multistaged sample of adolescents in grades 7 through 12. The Add
Health sample with appropriate application of sampling weights is
representative of in-school American adolescents. In addition to
in-depth adolescent interviews during 1995, a parent or caregiver
was interviewed when available.
The current study population includes non-Hispanic black and
white adolescents who reported a history of sexual intercourse
(N  4962), comprising 847 black females, 939 black males, 1691
white females, and 1485 white males. The sample was limited to
sexually experienced adolescents, because STD risks are minimal
among those with no sexual history.15 Of the 14,003 non-Hispanic
black and white Add Health Wave 1 participants, 1288 (59%)
black females, 956 (47%) black males, 3395 (68%) white females,
and 3402 (71%) white males were excluded as a result of lack of
sexual experience.
The outcome, any self-reported STD history, was based on
responses to questions about having ever been told by a clinician
that they had gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, syphilis, trichomo-
niasis, genital warts, herpes simplex virus, or HIV/AIDS.
We assessed 4 socioeconomic indicators: maternal educational
attainment, maternal occupation, family household composition,
and 1994 adjusted household income. Self-reported maternal ed-
ucational attainment was categorized into high school graduate or
less, some post-high school education, and college graduate or
further education. The categories of adolescent-reported maternal
occupation were no occupation, service or manual labor, nonpro-
fessional office, and professional. The adolescent report of mater-
nal occupation was used because only 1 caregiver was interviewed,
and the survey question related to the occupation of that individual
rather than the occupation of both parents. Household composi-
tion, as reported by the adolescent, was grouped into 2-parent,
single-mother, and other household structures, which included
single-father homes, foster placements, and households headed by
nonparent family members. Parental report of household income
was divided by the federal poverty threshold income for the same
household size to represent the relative amount of income beyond
basic subsistence.16,17 Income was then categorized relative to the
poverty threshold: high (over 300%), medium (151­300%), and
low (less than 151%).
Analyses were performed separately by race and sex to allow for
investigation of factors important for each of these groups. Prev-
alence odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using generalized esti-
mating equations (GEE) that accounted for the complex survey
design of Add Health (stratified, unequally weighted sample with
multiple sampling levels) with the GENMOD procedure in SAS
8.2.18
For each race­gender group, simple models were developed
separately for each of the 4 SES measures. The influence of several
other variables on the SES­STD associations was assessed in
multiple logistic regression using GEE, accounting for the com-
plex survey design. Variables assessed as potential confounding or
modifying factors included age, sexual behaviors (number of sex-
ual partners, history of trading sex for money or drugs, and history
of rape experience [female as survivor/male as perpetrator]), sex-
ual risk perceptions (sexual orientation, condom use knowledge,
and feelings regarding protection against STD and HIV risks),
nonsexual risk behaviors (substance use, including cigarettes, al-
cohol, marijuana, and cocaine; history of being held back a grade
in school; perceived health status; and lack of health insurance),
and parental factors (parents belonging to the parent­teacher or-
ganization [PTO] and parent's satisfaction with the parent­child
relationship). Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) were used to iden-
tify intervening variables not appropriate for inclusion in the
models.19,20
In models containing each SES measure and 1 additional factor,
factors were tested for effect modification and were retained, as
such, if stratum-specific ORs differed by 150% or more and the
Breslow-Day test of homogeneity was significant (P 0.20); how-
ever, no factors met these criteria. Initial assessment of confound-
ing was based on models with each SES factor and a single
additional variable. Factors creating 10% or greater change in the
SES­STD ORs were placed in full models. Backward elimination
was used to eliminate variables from full models, dropping each
adjustment factor 1 at a time. Factors that created a 10% or greater
change the SES­STD associations were retained in final models.
To improve robustness, final models are based on analysis of
imputed data from multiple Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
imputations performed in the SAS MI procedure.21 Because re-
sponse to the household income measure was low (74%), sensi-
tivity analysis on a range of possible values for missing incomes
was performed. For the sensitivity analysis, 1 of the following was
used to replace missing income values: 1) values imputed in SAS
MI, 2) median tract income, or 3) placement of all missing values
in the high, or 4) low income categories. Results from these
replacements were compared with results for individuals with
nonmissing income data (complete cases).
This study was approved by the University of North Carolina
Medical Institutional Review Board.
Results
The mean age for each race­gender group of study participants
was 17 years old (standard error [SE]  0.1). Over 50% of black
males reported engaging in sexual intercourse with more than 1
partner (Table 1), whereas less than 50% of the other race­gender
groups reported multiple partners. Reports of all types of drug use,
including cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and marijuana
or cocaine use, were more common among white adolescents than
black adolescents with white males having the most prevalent drug
use.
Indicators of Socioeconomic Status
Nationally representative estimates of family SES were gener-
ally lower for black adolescents (Table 2). Eleven percent to 15%
of black adolescents had college-graduate mothers, whereas close
to 20% of white adolescents had college-graduate mothers. Close
to 70% of each race­gender group had mothers who worked in
service fields, manual labor, or nonprofessional office positions.
Single-mother homes were the most common living arrangements
for black adolescents, whereas over two thirds of white adolescents

lived with 2 parents. Over 50% of black adolescents were in the
lowest-income group, whereas fewer than 25% of white adoles-
cents had this same income level.
Sexually Transmitted Disease Prevalence
The prevalence of STD reports was lowest among white males
(2.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9­3.1), higher among
white females (5.8%; 95% CI, 4.5­7.0) and black males (6.9%;
95% CI, 4.2­9.6), and markedly higher among black females
(19.9%; 95% CI, 15.6­24.1). The most prevalent STD for each
group was chlamydial infection.
Maternal Education
Lower maternal education was weakly, but not significantly, asso-
ciated with higher STD reports across all groups, except white fe-
males. The odds of STDs for black females with mothers in the high
school or less group were 1.8 (95% CI, 0.6­5.6) times higher than for
black females with college-graduate mothers (Table 3). The odds of
STDs were 2.8 (95% CI, 0.6­12.7) times higher for black males with
mothers in the lowest educational group than for those with college-
graduate mothers. STD levels were lower or similar for white females
in the lower maternal education groups compared with those with
college-educated mothers. For white males, a strong but imprecise
association existed between lower maternal education and STDs.
After adjusting for additional factors, maternal education­STD asso-
ciations changed very little (Table 4).
Maternal Occupation
In bivariate analyses, nonprofessional maternal occupations ap-
peared to be associated with higher STD reports for all groups
except white females (Table 3). Black females with mothers em-
ployed in office work (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.1­7.6) and service or
manual labor (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2­5.8) were more likely to
report STDs than black females with mothers in professional
occupations. Black males experienced similar or greater magni-
tudes of effect as black females, but these associations were less
precise and not statistically significant. For white females, mater-
nal occupation was not associated with STD reports in contrast to

FAMILY SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND SELF-REPORTED STDs
the other race­gender groups. STD reports appeared to be higher
for white males with mothers in nonprofessional occupations with
strong associations for service and office-position categories, but
these associations were imprecise.
After adjustment, associations between nonprofessional mater-
nal occupations and reported STDs increased slightly for black
females (Table 4). For the other race­gender groups, these asso-
ciations changed little, typically toward the null.
Household Composition
In bivariate models, self-reported STDs were consistently higher
for those living in single-father, nonparental, or foster homes
(Table 3). For all groups, the odds of STDs were approximately 2
times higher for adolescents in these households compared with
those in 2-parent homes. Single-mother households were not
strongly associated with STDs for black females, black males, and
white females. With only 1 STD report among white males in
single-mother homes, a negative association with STDs was found.
After adjustment, most household composition­STD associations
remained unchanged or decreased slightly (Table 4). Household
composition associations increased for black males to 2.9 times
(95% CI, 1.1­7.5) higher odds of STDs for other household types
and 2.0 times (95% CI, 0.7­5.8) higher odds of STDs for single-
mother homes when compared with 2-parent homes.

Adjusted Household Income
A possible association of lower household income and STD
reports was observed only among black males (Table 3). In the
lowest-income group, STD odds for black males were 2.7 (0.5­
15.4) times higher than those with the highest income, but this
estimate is imprecise. The associations between lower household
income and reported STDs changed little in multivariate analysis
(Table 4).
Sensitivity Analysis of Missing Household Income Data
As a result of the high level of missing household income data
(26%), which was unlikely to be missing at random,12 we per-
formed a sensitivity analysis of unadjusted income­STD associa-
tions with missing incomes replaced with different values. Asso-
ciations for black females, white females, and white males varied
little across the different replacement methods (Table 5), suggest-
ing that income was missing approximately at random in these
groups. For black males, however, when missing values were
placed into the lowest-income group, the results were similar to
complete case associations. Given that STDs were more prevalent
among black males with missing income (9.2%; 95% CI, 3.9­
14.4) than those with income data (6.0%; 95% CI, 3.4­8.5), these
differences suggest that reported crude and adjusted lower in-
come­STD associations for black males could be underestimates
of the true association.
Discussion
The relationships among SES, race, gender, and negative health
outcomes have been repeatedly identified as important public
health issues.12,22­24 However, these associations are difficult to
assess because of complexities in the relationships among race,
gender, and SES, as well as the difficulty in identifying appropriate
SES measures.8,9,11 In this examination of family SES and adoles-
cent self-reports of STDs, we performed analyses stratified by race
and gender, because direct comparisons have limited validity ow-
ing to the inability to adjust for the myriad of factors responsible
for observed differences. We examined 4 SES measures to assess
differences in their associations with adolescent STD reports for
these race­gender groups.
We observed substantial differences in the family SES and STD
relationships by race, gender, and SES measure. Generally, mea-
sures indicating lower SES were more consistently related to STD
among blacks. Family structure, maternal occupation, and, to a
lesser extent, maternal education were associated with STDs
among black females and males. For black males, the association
of STDs with maternal education and occupation were not statis-
tically significant; however, the magnitude of the point estimates
were comparable to those of black females, suggesting important,
but imprecise, effects. In contrast, only nontraditional family struc-
ture was associated with STD among white females. Income was
generally a poor indicator of STD risk in all groups, as expected.
The observed differences in the association of SES measures
and STDs by race and gender could represent racial differences in

FAMILY SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND SELF-REPORTED STDs
contextual and individual risks. The single absolute, and difficult-
to-measure, risk factor for STD acquisition is sexual contact with
an infected partner. One step removed from this risk factor is
participation in a sexual network with infected persons. In the
United States, sexual networks are highly segregated by race.25,26
Furthermore, the geographic distribution of blacks and whites by
SES is not equivalent. Lower SES blacks tend to be concentrated
in urban areas and the rural southeast,27 both areas with a high
prevalence of STDs. In contrast, lower SES whites are spread
throughout rural areas in the remainder of the United States, which
tend to have low STD prevalence. Our results suggest that for
blacks, economic advantage, measured by maternal education or
maternal occupation, could be associated with removal from a high
STD-prevalence sexual network to a lower-risk network, perhaps
through relocation to a more affluent area. In contrast, white
adolescents with lower SES could be living in areas with histori-
cally low STD prevalence. It would be of interest to assess the
contextual settings that these adolescents reside within to deter-
mine whether the geographic context of their communities are
clearly associated with the individual SES measures and STD
prevalence.
We expected family SES to have a stronger impact on adoles-
cent STDs because family SES should affect the adolescent's
proximity to and interactions with high-risk sexual networks. We
anticipated that family SES would influence residential loca-
tion,26,28,29 access to health care, particularly STD screening,30­32
and parental capacity to discuss sexual risks.29,33­43 Instead, the
relatively weak associations found suggest that family SES might
be less important than other factors such as individual risk behav-
iors and community-level influences, including community SES.
Individual factors such as number of sexual partners and trading
sex for drugs or money have been associated with STD reports in
racial­gender subgroups.44 Additionally, when adjusted for indi-
vidual risk behaviors, black­white disparities in adolescent STDs
were reduced, whereas they increased when adjusted for SES.7
Although neighborhood poverty levels were not found to consis-
tently reduce racial disparities in adolescent STDs,40 other com-
munity-level influences such as income inequality, segregation,
and social capital investment have yet to be investigated and could
prove to be critical for disparities in adolescent STDs as they have
for other types of health disparities.6,12,45­47
We did not anticipate an absence of association between mater-
nal education or occupation and STDs for white females. In
addition to the potential contextual explanations, differences in
individual risk behavior could contribute to the observed differ-
ences in SES measures. Among female adolescents, lower parental
education has been associated with early sexual activity but not
with number of sexual partners,48 suggesting less variation in
sexual risks across SES levels for white females compared with
other groups. Although we adjusted for the number of sexual
partners, we could not assess other partnership characteristics such
as concurrency49,50 and partnership age or racial dispari-
ty,26,49,51­54 which could affect white female SES­STD associa-
tions.
Unfortunately, in the United States, race remains a marker of
STD prevalence. The substantial disparity in STDs by race is
unlikely to be the result of biologic mechanisms, but rather, results
from a complex interaction of individual and contextual factors,
including SES. The complexity of these numerous relationships
contributes to the fact that observed racial disparities cannot be
adequately assessed in single models directly comparing racial
groups. In epidemiologic terms, direct race comparisons are diffi-
cult to justify because the implicit counterfactual comparison is not
justifiable.8­10 By examining the relationship of SES measures and
STD after stratification by race and gender, we clearly demon-
strated that the association of these measures with STDs differs by
race, which supports our underlying rationale for using this strat-
ified approach.
SES is a multifaceted construct that cannot be described ade-
quately with a single measure. We observed, as have others in-
vestigating similar outcomes including adult STDs55 and adoles-
cent initiation of sexual intercourse,48 that household income had
weaker associations than other SES measures. Although measure-
ment error and missing data are plausible explanations for this
weak association, income could simply not reflect the complexity
of SES. Other measures of family SES such as wealth,12,56 parental
(not only maternal) measures, or composites of multiple SES
measures56 could have provided different insights than the 4 SES
measures used.
Our selected socioeconomic indicators have potential limita-
tions, including appropriateness, number of missing observations,
differential reporting, and measurement error. We held the SES

variable categories constant across race­gender groups to allow
for comparison between the groups, but disproportionate represen-
tation in the categories could influence the observed results. With
fewer blacks in the highest SES groups and fewer whites in the
lower groups, we lose the ability to create categories representing
the nonoverlapping tails of these distributions, which could be
critical in health disparities.12,22,57 Also, the same absolute levels
of SES do not imply the same level of benefits for each group with
blacks and females benefiting less than whites and males at the
same level.11,22
The cross-sectional study design limits assessment of the causal
relationship between SES and STD reports. However, directions of
potential causal relationships are not in doubt because the family
SES indicators (maternal education, maternal occupation, house-
hold composition, and annual household income) are unlikely to
result from an adolescent's STD status. Temporality could be a
problem, particularly in relation to other variables included in this
study. The outcome includes infections occurring throughout the
sexual histories of these adolescents, so we cannot be certain that
risk behaviors and attitudes preceded STD diagnosis.58
Although the STD prevalences in this study are similar to those
from other adolescent STD research,7 our prevalence underesti-
mates the true prevalence of infections because it is based on
self-reports. Potential causes for underestimation include underre-
porting, asymptomatic infections, and lack of screening in high-
risk populations. Underreporting of STD diagnoses can result from
embarrassment or misunderstanding of a diagnosis.59,60 In Add
Health, audio computer-assisted interviews (A-CASI) were con-
ducted to limit bias and nonresponse for sensitive items such as
STD histories.61­64 Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infec-
tions are common among females and would be missed unless
screening occurred.65,66 Female patients commonly undergo STD
screening, but regular contact with the medical system is less
frequent for adolescent males. However, because sexually trans-
mitted infections are more commonly symptomatic in males, treat-
ment is typically sought.30,67
We combined multiple STDs in a single measure to maximize
the STD prevalence. Different STDs could have distinct patterns of
occurrence, which might be related to SES, possibly affecting
observed results. Chlamydial infection was the most predominant
STD in this sample; however, the use of a composite STD outcome
measure limits the ability to interpret the results for any single
STD.
Add Health used a school-based sample and did not include
adolescents who dropped out of school before the survey. Conse-
quently, youths presumably at high risk for STDs and relatively
lower SES could have been excluded disproportionately.68 How-
ever, a recent evaluation of the adequacy of the sampling of Add
Health suggests that bias arising from school dropouts could be
minimal.69
STDs are among the most common health problems faced by
American adolescents. Race,4,6,7,35,51,70­78 gender,4,51,74,79,80 and
socioeconomic status6,7,81 have repeatedly been demonstrated to be
associated with STDs among adolescents. However, more in-depth
considerations of adolescent STD disparities have been limited.
Our results demonstrate important differences in family SES and
increased adolescent STD reports when stratified by race and
gender. Future investigation of adolescent STD disparities, partic-
ularly with biologic measures of prevalent infections, should strat-
ify by race and gender when possible. In addition, studies consid-
ering the role of SES should include multiple indicators. For most
adolescents, family SES has minimal effects on STD risks, but
other factors could still influence these outcomes, including ado-
lescent-specific factors and community-specific factors.
