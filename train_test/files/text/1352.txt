adiposity in white, black, and Mexican-American adults,

Objective: To describe changes in the distribution of waist
circumference (WC) and abdominal obesity (AO) in white,
black, and Mexican-American adults from 1988 through
2000.
Research Methods and Procedures: Nationally representa-
tive cross-sectional surveys of adults 20 to 79 years of age
were examined using data from U.S. National Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys of 1988 to 1994 and 1999 to
2000. AO was defined as WC 102 cm in men and 88 cm
in women.
Results: There was a gradient of increasing WC and AO
with increasing age in both study periods in whites and
blacks. In men, the average increase between the study
periods in overall WC in whites, blacks, and Mexican
Americans were 3, 3.3, and 3.4 cm, respectively. The cor-
responding values in women were 2.4, 5.3, and 3.7 cm,
respectively. In men, the percentage change in prevalence of
AO between 1988 and 2000 ranged from 5.5% in Mexican-
American men to 8.2% in white men. In women, there was
a 1.7% decrease in AO in Mexican Americans, whereas
there was an increase of 6.3% for whites and 7% for blacks.
Discussion: Despite increased understanding of the need for
screening and treatment for obesity, this study indicates
increasing prevalence of AO in white and black Americans.
Without concerted effort to reduce the prevalence of overall
obesity, the increasing prevalence of AO is likely to lead to
increased prevalence of metabolic syndromes in the United
States. Our results highlight the need to design evidence-
based programs that show promise for long-term health
behavior changes to facilitate the prevention of AO and
related comorbidities.

Introduction
Abdominal obesity (AO)1 is an important public health
problem and is a component of cardiovascular risks (1,2).
AO is associated with the metabolic syndrome, which in-
cludes hypertension, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance,
hypertriglyceridemia, elevated levels of low-density li-
poprotein, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol (3­8). AO is also linked with cancers of many sites,
including breast, colon, and the kidney (9­11).
Whereas the best methods for estimating abdominal fat
patterning are by imaging techniques such as magnetic
resonance and computed tomography, an anthropometric
surrogate [waist circumference (WC)] is used for large-
scale population-based studies. Measurement of WC is sim-
ple, requiring only a tape and little training. Also, WC is
highly correlated with visceral adiposity, which is recog-
nized as the most metabolically active form of adiposity
(12,13).
The mechanism linking AO with cardiovascular diseases
is poorly understood. However, the link may be due to its

correlation with visceral obesity. Two possible mechanisms
have been suggested for the mode of action of AO in
cardiovascular diseases: 1) through the predominance of the
highly sensitive lipolytic hypertrophied visceral adipose tis-
sues, free fatty acids may provoke insulin resistance
(14,15); and 2) elevated free testosterone and reduced sex-
hormone-binding globulin may be triggers for increased
abdominal adiposity and reduced fractional hepatic extrac-
tion of insulin (16). Thus, the association of adiposity with
cardiovascular diseases may be caused by visceral fat depot
discharging free fatty acids into the portal and systemic
circulation (17).
National Institute of Health (NIH) Clinical Guidelines
recommend the measurement of waist as a screening tool
for health risk (18). The NIH guideline advocates risk
stratification based on WC. WC values of 102 cm or greater
in men and 88 cm or greater in women are the cut-off points
for AO (18,19). These WC cut-off points were proposed by
Lean et al. (20) and later by Han et al. (21) to assist
professionals in managing subjects with obesity-related co-
morbidities.
Sexual dimorphism and ethnic differences are well
known for AO (22­24). As suggested by some investiga-
tions, blacks have higher upper-body adiposity, based on
WC, compared with whites (23,24). Blacks' susceptibility
to AO may be due to their larger visceral fat deposits
(23,25). Indeed, some investigators suggest that blacks'
propensity to metabolic aberrations may be a result of
excess visceral adiposity compared with whites. Others
have postulated that racial differences with regard to upper
body fat cells may be associated with racial differences in
metabolic risk factors (26).
Despite racial/ethnic differences in AO, no data exist
describing ethnic trends in AO estimated from WC in U.S.
adults. Hence, in this report, we describe the changes in the
distribution of WC in white, black, and Mexican-American
adult men and women from 1988 through 2000. We also
sought to determine the prevalence and trends in AO, using
the NIH expert panel and World Health Organization con-
sultation group recommended definitions (18,19).
Research Methods and Procedures
Data Source
The U.S. National Center for Health Statistics provided
datasets that were used in this study. These datasets repre-
sent two time periods, 1988­1994 and 1999­2000, that
were from cross-sectional surveys with similar designs and
were carried out among noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian
populations. Descriptions of the plan and operation of these
surveys have been described by other investigators (27,28).
Briefly, these two surveys have a similar structure and
design and are national in scope.
The U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) III (1988­1994) was based on a com-
plex, multi-stage sampling plan. This survey was the first
examination survey without an upper age limit. Also, in
NHANES III, a home examination option was employed for
the first time to obtain examination data for very young
children and for elderly persons who were unable to visit the
mobile examination centers. Approximately 30,818 persons
were examined in NHANES III. NHANES 1999 to 2000 is
the most recent of the health examination surveys carried
out by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics.
The NHANES 1999 to 2000 was a stratified multistage
probability sample based on selection of counties, blocks,
households, and persons within households. Like NHANES
III, NHANES 1999 to 2000 was designed to oversample
Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic blacks to improve
estimates for these groups. Approximately 9965 persons
completed the NHANES 1999 to 2000 survey.
Only adults who were identified as non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, or Mexican American between 20 to 79
years old were included in this investigation. This study was
also restricted to subjects who were measured for WCs.
Women who were pregnant at the time of the surveys were
excluded from this analysis. In the surveys, waist measure-
ments were made at the natural waist midpoint between the
lowest aspect of the rib cage and highest point of the iliac
crest (to the nearest 0.1 cm).
Definition of Terms
AO was defined as WC 102 and 88 cm for men and
women, respectively (18,19).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical programs available in SAS for Windows (29)
and SUDAAN (30) were used for this analysis. To account
for unequal probabilities of selection, oversampling, and
nonresponse, appropriate sample weights were used for the
analyses. SE estimates were calculated using the SUDAAN
statistical program. For NHANES III, the Taylor series
linearization method was used to estimate SEs (30). For
NHANES 1999 to 2000, SEs were estimated by means of
the delete 1 jackknife method (31), partitioning the sample
into 52 replicates by deleting one unit at a time.
WC was normalized using Log10
, and overall and age-
specific differences in WC among ethnic groups were as-
sessed using one-way ANOVA. Sex-specific distribution of
WC in the population was evaluated using nonparametric
smoothed curves, based on sequential calculations of run-
ning medians for groups with adjacent points (32). Preva-
lences of AO were age-adjusted by direct methods using the
2000 U.S. population census data and employing 20 to 39,
40 to 59, and 60 year age groupings. These age categories
are consistent with the NHANES 1999 to 2000 sample
design age groups that have been recommended for analy-
ses. The customary 95%CIs and p values of 0.05 were
used to indicate statistical significance.

Results
A total of 8272 white, 5122 black, and 5346 Mexican-
American subjects were eligible for this investigation.
Overall and age-specific mean values of WC stratified by
sex are provided in Table 1. In men, the average increases
between the 1988 to 1994 and 1999 to 2000 periods in
overall WC in whites, blacks, and Mexican Americans were
3, 3.3, and 3.4 cm, respectively. The corresponding values
in women were 2.4, 5.3, and 3.7 cm, respectively. There was
a gradient of increasing WC with increasing age in both
study periods in white, black, and Mexican-American men
and women. In men, whites had overall and age-specific
WC values that were higher than those of blacks and Mex-
ican Americans for both 1988 to 1994 and 1999 to 2000
(p  0.05). A significantly higher WC was also observed in
1999 to 2000 compared with the 1988 to 1994 period for
men of all three ethnic groups. The largest absolute differ-
ence between study periods in WC was observed in the 20-
to 39-year-old Mexican-American men, with a difference of
8.7 cm. In women, blacks had greatest overall and age-
specific WC compared with whites and Mexican Americans
in both study periods. In women, the largest difference
between study periods in WC was observed in the 20- to
39-year-old black women, with a difference of 4.7 cm.
The distribution of WC in the population was evaluated
in white, black and Mexican-American men and women for
the 1988 to 1994 and 1999 to 2000 study periods (Figure 1).
In men, the distribution curves shifted to the right, indicat-
ing higher WC in 1999 to 2000 for each of the ethnic groups
that were investigated. A similar pattern was observed in
women, and the shift to the right tended to be greater in
women than men. Also, in women, shifts to higher WC
values were greater in blacks than in whites and Mexican-
Americans.
The prevalence of AO during 1988 to 2000 stratified by
age and sex for those subjects who were 20 years old and
older and age-specific groups are shown in Table 2. There
were statistically significant differences in overall preva-
lence of AO in the two study periods in both men and
women (p  0.01). In men, the change in prevalence of AO
between 1988 to 1994 and 1999 to 2000 ranged from 5.5%
in Mexican-American men to 8.2% in white men. In
women, there was a 1.7% decrease in AO in Mexican
Americans compared with an increase of 6.3% for whites
and 7% for blacks. Compared with black men, black women
were 39.4% more abdominally obese in 1988 to 1994 and
38.7% more obese in 1999 to 2000.
Discussion
Concern about AO is not new. In 1956, Vague (33)
postulated that gynoid and android body habitue
´s might
play a role in cardiovascular diseases. This concept has
subsequently been popularized by Lean et al. (20) and Han
et al. (21) and has gained considerable support from differ-
ent studies. AO is now recognized as an important factor in
insulin resistance syndrome. Because of the voluminous
data in recent years regarding the negative effects of obe-
sity, we hypothesized a statistically significant decrease in
the prevalence of AO in the 1999 to 2000 period compared
with the prevalence of AO that was recorded in the 1988 to
1994 period.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe trends
in AO in the three predominant U.S. ethnic groups. This is
also the first investigation to use the new proposed WC
cut-off point for obesity recommended by the NIH expert
panel on the identification, evaluation, and the treatment of
overweight and obesity to assess the three U.S. ethnic
groups (18) These series of surveys represent the best avail-
able data because the sampling schemes were similar and
representative of the national population. The training pro-
gram and quality control measures instituted in the surveys
give an added credibility to the data. An important limita-
tion of this study, however, is that the data are inadequate
for determining the causes of the relatively quick increase in
the prevalence of AO as defined by WC cut-off points.
Our study showed increases in WC in white and black
men and women and Mexican-American men in 1999 to
2000 compared with 1988 to 1994. The distribution of WC
shifted to the right (higher values) in 1999 to 2000 for each
of the three ethnic groups that were investigated. The shift
to the right was greater in women than men. The result of
this investigation showed overall higher prevalences of AO
in the 1999 to 2000 study period in white and black men and
women. The greatest difference in the overall prevalence of
AO between men and women was observed among blacks,
with values of 39.4% in the 1988 to 1994 and 38.7% in the
1999 to 2000 study periods. There was no increase between
the study periods in prevalences of AO in 40- to 59-year-old
Mexican-American men and overall and age-specific cate-
gories studied in Mexican-American women.
The shifts in the distribution of WC to higher values and
overall increases in AO for each of the three ethnic groups
in men and women (except Mexican-American men 40 to
49 years old and all Mexican-American women) are con-
sistent with those using BMI as the marker for obesity. The
age-adjusted prevalence of obesity using BMI increased
from 22.9% in NHANES III (1988 to 1994) to 30.5% in
1999 to 2000 (34).
The overall increase in the prevalence of AO in 1999 to
2000 compared with 1988 to 1994, despite voluminous data
in epidemiological and clinical journals since NHANES III
regarding the negative effects of obesity, may be explained
by public health inability to publicize ill effects of obesity
(35). Arguably, the lack of decrease in AO may also be
attributed to the short time periods between surveys. Dis-
ease changes caused by public health interventions are often
associated with much larger time periods (in excess of the

12 years between NHANES III and NHANES 1999 to
2000). Other investigators believe that the low rate of phy-
sician counseling about exercise and nutrition for obesity
may, in part, be associated with the lack of significant
decrease in overall adiposity (36). Reasons for decrease in
AO among Mexican-American women of all ages and Mex-
ican-American men 40 to 49 years old are not clear and
warrant further studies.
The contribution of AO to cardiovascular diseases and to
racial/ethnic differences in cardiovascular disease risks is
well known (3,37,38). In our previous study using
NHANES III data, we showed that 24%, 39.9%, and 15.7%
of type 2 diabetes in white, black, and Hispanic women,
respectively, could have been avoided if AO were absent
(3). We also showed that AO accounted for 12.1% and 9.8%
of racial/ethnic differences in the risk of type 2 diabetes
between white and black women and between white and
Hispanic women, respectively (3). Also, compared with
whites, black men and women had 1.58 and 1.39 times,
respectively, the increased risk for development of hyper-
tension if they had high values of AO (37). Similarly,
clustering of insulin resistance syndromes associated with
AO occurred significantly more often in blacks or Hispanics
compared with whites (38).
Metabolic abnormalities caused by AO start in childhood
(39). Fifty percent of obese children remain obese when
they grow up (40), and they develop insulin resistance
syndromes such as hypertension, glucose intolerance, dys-
lipidemia, and hyperinsulinemia in adolescence and young
adulthood (41). These facts have important implications for
early prevention and management of insulin resistance syn-
dromes.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates a clear increase in AO between
1988 and 2000 despite increased understanding of the need
for screening and treatment for obesity. With the exception
of Mexican-American women, AO is increasing in all three
U.S. ethnic groups that were evaluated in this study. Obesity
preventive measures should target high-risk groups. Future
