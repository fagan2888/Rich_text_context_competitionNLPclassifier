Introduction
The neurodiversity concept primarily relates toASD (Autism
Spectrum Disorder),ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder), Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, and Dyspraxia (Armstrong,
2010; Jaarsma & Welin, 2012; Pollak, 2009). It is proposed
that neurodiversity is similar to other personality differences,
such as the personality types measured with a Big Five
instrument (Costa & McCrae, 1992), that is, similar to per-
sons with transsexuality wanting to be identified by that term
instead of gender identity disorder.
In the peer-reviewed medical, behavioral, and psycho-
logical literature, the concept of neurodiversity is seldom
used. Instead, this literature primarily deals with disorders
defined in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American
Psychiatric Association, 2000).
ASDs are diagnosed based on difficulties in communica-
tion and social domains. Notably these involve a priori
assumptions about species-typical behavior. However, our
living environment has changed considerable in the last hun-
dred years. Evolution is ongoing but still, recent research has
shown that urban upbringing causes mood and anxiety disor-
ders, as well as Schizophrenia (Lederbogen et al., 2011).
Mood and anxiety disorders are frequent comorbidities to
ASDs. There is also a hypothesis that autism might be an
"Intense World Syndrome" (Markram, Rinaldi, & Markram,
2007). It is claimed that ASD diagnoses has increased
recently (Centers for Disease Control, 2008), and these find-
ings might account for part or all of this recent increase in
diagnosis.
Regarding causes for autism, theories of imbalanced
genomic imprinting (Badcock & Crespi, 2006), neurological
damage (Eigsti & Shapiro, 2003), and genetic defects
(Mendelsohn & Schaefer, 2008) have been proposed. Few of
the theories are mutually compatible, and most of them focus
only on narrow aspects of the autism spectrum. Some
researchers have interpreted this diagnostic elusiveness as

Autism, Personality, and Human
Diversity: Defining Neurodiversity in an
Iterative Process Using Aspie Quiz
Leif Ekblad1
Abstract
The aim of this study was to define neurodiversity in a scientific manner so it can be researched in further studies without
involving disorders defined by psychiatry or popular beliefs about neurodiversity in the autistic community. Neurodiversity
was defined as the primary factor output by factor analysis of a data set of human behaviors which contains evenly distributed
traits of all sorts that cover all of human diversity. Neurotypical function was defined as the second factor. The study used
many different traits and a large sample to find the full extent of neurodiversity, and to provide evenly distributed traits. The
result was a test with 145 scoring items and 5 control items that could give participants a neurodiverse and a neurotypical
score, and an indication that the participant was neurodiverse, neurotypical, or mixed. It was found that the neurodiversity
score was independent of gender and age, and that the prevalence appears to have remained unchanged. There were
possible differences in racial prevalence that need further research. The results correlated to many disorders defined by
psychiatry, and also with several factors in personality tests. People who had been diagnosed with these disorders had
considerably higher neurodiversity scores. The idea that neurodiversity was at the extreme end of a normal distribution was
not supported, rather it was found that neurodiversity had its own normal distribution overlapping typical traits.

evidence that there is no single explanation for autism
(Happé, Ronald, & Plomin, 2006).
So far genetic and epigenetic studies have only managed to
explain 10% to 20% of all autism cases, many of which seem
to involve clusters of copy number variations (CNVs). No sin-
gle mutation could account for more than 1% of autism, mak-
ing it etiologically very heterogeneous (Geschwind, 2009).
Epigenetic factors may play a role in the development of the
autistic phenotype. A large twin study concluded that suscepti-
bility toASD is moderately heritable and involves a substantial
shared twin environmental component (Hallmayer et al., 2011).
The substantial environmental component to ASD susceptibil-
ity is likely the result of the referral bias inherent in any dys-
function-based model used to diagnose ASD. Furthermore,
ASD, ADHD, and other neuropsychiatric disorders seem to
share a common genetic origin (Lionel et al., 2011).
Support for the neurodiversity concept comes from a
recent genome-wide analysis study (Voineagu et al., 2011).
The study found that discrete, coexpressed gene modules are
associated with autism but not single genes. More than 200
genes were expressed differently in autistic compared with
nonautistic brains. Furthermore, these genes regulate the
developmental patterning of the frontal cortex and temporal
cortex.
Even less studied, due to complexity, is the relationship
between autism and other personality traits. Mathematical
abilityhasbeenlinkedtoautism(Baron-Cohen,Wheelwright,
Burtenshaw, & Hobson, 2007) and autistic traits have been
suspected to be an independent personality dimension
(Wakabayashi, Baron-Cohen, & Wheelwright, 2006).
While the initial reason for the research was related to a
specific hypothesis about the cause of neurodiversity, the
aim of this presentation is to remain open regarding the
causes of ASD and neurodiversity, while still wanting to
remove cultural and environmental issues as much as possi-
ble. It was anticipated that a large part of several high-preva-
lence disorders defined in the DSM, and typically thought to
be part of neurodiversity, could be explained in terms of
human diversity rather than as dysfunctions. Unlike other
research that specifically focuses on the disability aspect of
ASD, this study did not evaluate traits according to their pos-
sible contribution to disability.
Neurodiversity today is defined in an arbitrary way as
DSM diagnoses are. This research defined neurodiversity as
the primary factor output by factor analysis of a data set of
human behaviors which contains evenly distributed traits of
all sorts that cover all of human diversity. Neurotypical wir-
ing was defined as the second factor. This provided a scien-
tific definition that could be used in replication. The main
problem in providing a test that can score neurodiversity and
neurotypical wiring using these definitions was to find the
full span of the neurodiversity spectrum, and to ensure that
the traits used were as independent as possible while still
being relevant. This required a very large population being
given a large set of questions.
Method
The primary hypothesis in this study was that factor analy-
sis of a broad ASD-related test would generate two consis-
tent factors that could be used to score neurodiversity and
neurotypical wiring. The tool used in the research (Aspie
Quiz) was developed in an iterative process in six different
phases.
Investigation Phase
This was the first phase in the iterative process of creating a
neurodiversity test. The objective was to create a reliable test
for the autism spectrum, and then to find as many traits as
possible that correlated to the reliable test.
Information about year of birth, gender, and diagnostic
status (no diagnosis, self-diagnosed, or professionally diag-
nosed) for AS/HFA/PDD (Asperger's syndrome, high func-
tioning autism, and pervasive development disorder) and
ADD/ADHD (attention deficit disorder, with or without
hyperactivity) was collected in all versions. In some ver-
sions, diagnostic status for autism, dyslexia, dyscalculia,
dyspraxia, bipolar, schizophrenia, Tourette, oppositional
defiant disorder (ODD), and nonverbal learning disorder
(NLD) have been collected.
Data collection started in June 2004. In Version 6 (2006),
the dual-factor nature of Aspie Quiz was first eminent.
Automatic score calculation and relevance estimation was
developed after this, and gave a list of 485 items and their
relevance estimates and factor loadings. Versions that did not
originally use factor analysis for score calculation were
recalculated to be able to use the items (and factor loadings)
in later analysis.
Consolidation Phase
This was the second phase. The objective was to find the best
items from the investigation phase and to create a stable core
with these items. The versions were labeled R1 to R7.
Data collection started in February 2007. There was a
need to iterate the item selection process in seven steps
before a stable core emerged. This phase generated rele-
vance estimates and factor loadings for 50 items in the
Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) test and for another 211
items.
Validation Phase
This was the third phase. The objective was to test (and
refine) the stable core of items from the consolidation phase
by adding various professional psychiatric instruments. The
versions were labeled S1 to S12.
Data collection started in June 2007. This phase tested
and produced relevance estimates and factor loadings for 405
new items.
Ekblad 3
Diagnostic Phase
This was the fourth phase. The objective was to try to pro-
vide diagnostic advice to participants. The versions were
labeled N1 to N4.
Data collection started in January 2008. There was a high
dependence between the selected target diagnoses. This
made differential diagnosis impossible, that is, some partici-
pants got every possible diagnosis as an advice, while others
got none. For differential diagnosis, one would need to
include negative aspects of the target diagnoses.
Final Phase 1
This was the fifth phase. The objective was to produce a final
version. Final Version 1 existed in 16 different releases (F1-F15
and FI). In some of these releases, the most promising instru-
ments from the item selection phase were run once more. This
was to get correlations that were guaranteed to be against the
same item selection. A few new instruments were also tested.
The combined Final Version 1 data set was constructed by
combining all English language answers to 16 different
releases of Final Version 1.
Final Version 1 was launched in mid-April 2008 and run
until September 2009. It had 145 items for scoring and got
88,382 answers. It had 22 neurotypical items.
Final Phase 2
In the sixth phase, a second final version (Final Version 2)
was created to have six identical dimensions on the Aspie
and neurotypical sides in the spider diagram that presented
scores to participants (see below).
Different releases of Final Version 2 existed to test new
items. The core always had the same 145 scoring items and
5 control items. Different releases saved results in different
database tables.
The Final Version 2 data set was created by combining
Final Version 2 releases.
In this phase information about year and month of birth,
gender, country, ancestry, and diagnostic status (no diagnosis,
self-diagnosed, or professionally diagnosed) for AS/HFA/
PDD and ADD/ADHD, OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder), and Social Phobia were collected.
Final Version 2 was launched in late October 2009 and
was run until August 2011. It had 145 items for scoring and
got 174,878 answers. There were 21 neurotypical items.
Used items and their properties are presented as supplemen-
tary information (see supplementary table, available in the
online version of this article at http://sgo.sagepub.com/
supplemental).
During the peer-review process, data collection contin-
ued. Another 176,438 answers were accumulated in the H3
release between January 2012 and January 2013. The H3
version used the Final Version 2 items.
Recruiting Participants
Links to a Swedish and English Aspie Quiz version were ini-
tially posted to a few selected autism community sites (Aspie
forum Yahoo group, http://www.aspiesforfreedom.com, and
http://www.wrongplanet.net). A year later, many people had
recommended Aspie Quiz and had posted links to many dif-
ferent sites. The continued recruitment process depended on
Aspie Quiz becoming a popular self-test on autism commu-
nity forums. Many people added links to their blogs or live
journals. Some people posted links to very popular general-
discussion forums.
User Account Registration
User accounts were introduced in the validation phase (ver-
sion S2). A user id was stored with all answers from version
S2.
Participation
The referral report for the Final Version 1 contains 229 dif-
ferent links that 10 or more participants had used to do Aspie
Quiz. Aspie Quiz attracted on average 300 participants a day
from many different locations. The test can easily be found
with search engines and Google returns 62,200 hits for
"Aspie Quiz." Participation was neither controlled, nor
random.
Data Analysis
Factor analysis was done with MVSP (Multivariate Statistic
Package, Kovach Computing Services). Kaiser's rule was
used to extract factors. The standardize data option was
checked so rarer traits gained increased significance. The
center data option was not checked. Unanswered items were
set to 0. There were no attempts to remove duplicate answers
in the database, but up to the validation phase each IP address
could only enter a single answer.
DataFit was used to try to match the score difference dis-
tribution to different mathematical functions. DataFit
includes a bell curve distribution function, but this function
provided poor fits to the score distribution. Some distribu-
tions looked like two overlapping bell curves, and therefore
a dual bell curve formula was introduced in DataFit (a ×
exp((-(x - b)2) / (2 × c2)) + d × exp((-(x - e)2) / (2 × f2)) + g).
Item Selection
An initial list of 100 items was put together in 2004 by Inger
Lorelei based on our personal experience, on characteriza-
tion by Martha Kate Downey (Downey), Roger Meyers
(Meyer), and Tony Attwood (Attwood), and on items bor-
rowed (but reworded) from the AQ questionnaire (Baron-
Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, & Clubley, 2001).
4 SAGE Open
In the investigation phase, the aim was to test as much as
possible that could be related to neurodiversity, as this was
required by the definition of neurodiversity. New items
mostly came from online discussions and polls on autism
community forums like http://www.wrongplanet.net and
http://www.aspiesforfreedom.com.
Items from the investigation phase were used as a starting
point for selecting the most unique and relevant items possi-
ble in the consolidation phase. The method used for selecting
the most relevant and unique items was based on two differ-
ent reports. The first report was based on all items that had
previously been tested, but that was not part of the current
item selection. It listed a number of these items with the low-
est correlations with all other items along with their rele-
vance estimates. The second report used items in the current
item selection. It listed which of the current items had the
highest dependence, presenting items in pairs, with their rel-
evance estimates.
As the neurodiversity definition required evenly distrib-
uted traits, the goal was to create a heterogeneous set of
items. The elimination criterion was to throw out items that
were most similar to others, but among those that were simi-
lar, the most relevant were selected and the ones that dis-
criminated least well between Aspies and neurotypicals were
eliminated. Some of the added items were removed again
because there already existed similar items in the instrument
that hadn't been tested together before. The selection method
added items with the lowest correlations to other items, so
that Aspie Quiz would cover the widest possible range of
traits with the fewest possible items.
Two additional reports were also used in the item selec-
tion process. One of these listed percentage of "?" answers
for items in the current item selection. Too high percentages
of "?" answers indicated an item was hard to answer for par-
ticipants, and items with above 10% of "?" answers were
generally not considered acceptable. The other report listed
well-known environmental problems. The goal was to elimi-
nate environmental problems, and therefore a group of items
with known environmental background was used in the
instrument as a reference to be able to spot and eliminate
items with high correlations to them.
In the validation phase, various professional psychiatric
instruments were added to try to find new relevant items and
to assess correlations between instrument scores and Aspie
Quiz scores. A new report was created to find new relevant
items and to discard similar items. This report listed the items
in the current version. For each listed item, it listed all items
in the current version that had a correlation with the item that
exceeded 90% of the listed item's relevance estimate. This
relied on an empirical finding of a linear relationship between
an item's relevance estimate and average correlation with
other items (Figure 1). Without this method, the requirement
in the neurodiversity definition of evenly distributed traits
would not be met. The cutoff at 90% was an empirical finding
that provided good results. Items from the professional
psychiatric instruments were included in this report. After
new items from the professional instruments had been tested
in the instrument, items that looked promising (high relevance
estimate and low correlation to other items) were added as
experimental items in the next version.
Control Items, Ordering, and Uncertain Response
Control items were introduced in the validation phase. They
were selected among existing item pairs that had large nega-
tive correlations (typically in the range of -.55 to -.65).
Five pairs of control items were added early in the valida-
tion phase. These items were designed such that one of the
items in the pair would normally be answered positively by
Aspies while the other would normally be answered posi-
tively by neurotypicals. When somebody answered both
items with "yes" or "no," this was considered as a control
item inconsistency. Participants were allowed to answer no
more than one item inconsistently. This arrangement made it
impossible to receive high or low scores just by checking
"yes" or "no" on all items.
Starting in the validation phase, items were presented in
random order to ensure that people didn't know the objective
of items by looking at nearby items. This also mixed up con-
trol items with ordinary items.
The "?" (I don't know) choice was checked by default to
detect unanswered items. Posting answers with too many "?"
choices was disallowed by requiring a total Aspie and neuro-
typical weight sum of at least 200 (see also below).
Scoring
Aspie Quiz had three answer alternatives: "no" (score 0),
"sometimes" (score 1), and "yes" (score 2). It also had a "?"
(don't know) alternative. When the "?" alternative was
checked, the item would not be part of scoring. This was
Figure 1. Average correlation with other questions versus
relevance estimate for all questions.
Ekblad 5
achieved by producing a total weighted score of answered
items (sum of weight factors multiplied by scores), dividing
this by the maximum possible score (sum of weight factors
multiplied by 2) and finally multiplying it by 200. This pro-
cedure was used for the Aspie score and the neurotypical
score separately.
Factor loadings were used for score calculation from the
middle of the investigation phase. This resulted in two differ-
ent scores based on factor loadings: Aspie score and neuro-
typical score. Aspie score was based on the primary
(neurodiversity) factor and neurotypical (nonautistic) score
on the secondary factor of Principal Components Analysis
(PCA). The average of an item's factor loading in all ver-
sions the item had been part of was used. These factor load-
ings were multiplied by 100 and rounded to integers and
gave the Aspie and neurotypical weight factors for items in
the instrument. To increase span of scores, if Aspie weight
factor and neurotypical weight factor were positive, the
lower weight factor was replaced by zero and the higher
weight factor was replaced by the difference between weight
factors.
Participants got the judgment "very likely Aspie" (neuro-
diverse) if their Aspie score was at least 35 points higher than
their neurotypical score, and "very likely neurotypical" (neu-
rotypical) if their neurotypical score was at least 35 points
higher than their Aspie score. The interval in-between was
judged as "both Aspie and neurotypical traits" (mixed). The
cutoff was set to 35 late in the investigation phase so that
80% of diagnosed AS/HFA/PDD would get their diagnoses
confirmed.
Calculating Relevance Estimate for Items
In the investigation phase,Aspie Quiz asked for self-reported
diagnostic information about AS/HFA/PDD. As it was
pointed out to all subjects that the data were analyzed anony-
mously and people were taking part voluntarily, this self-
report was seen as sufficient for classifying subjects into
Aspie control group. The neurotypical control group was
constructed based on the referral information that web
browsers send back to a website. Referral sites unrelated to
autism were included in the neurotypical control group. The
Aspie control group and neurotypical control group allowed
calculating the relevance estimates for each item.
In the middle of the investigation phase, scoring was
changed to use factor loadings. From then on, participants
were grouped based on the total instrument scores.
Participants that got "very likely Aspie" were assigned to the
Aspie (neurodiverse) group while participants that got "very
likely neurotypical" were assigned to the neurotypical group.
The relevance estimate for an item was calculated as the cor-
relation between answers from these groups. The neurotypi-
cal control group based on referrer sites, and self-reported
diagnostic information was no longer needed for relevance
estimation, and was only used as a sanity check.
Comparing With Other Instruments
The AQ (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001) was used to validate item
selection in the consolidation phase. It was run as voluntary
in experimental version 4 (R4).
In the validation phase, the following professional instru-
ments were used to validate Aspie Quiz and to do a prelimi-
nary check for the relation to neurodiversity:
1. SPQ-A, Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, that
was developed in 1991 by Adrian Raine, Department
of Psychology, University of Southern California, Los
Angeles. The test measures schizotypal traits in
adults. Its validity and factor structure have been
checked (Axelrod, Grilo, Sanislow, & McGlashan,
2001). It was run as voluntary in stable version 3 (S3).
2. LSAS, Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, that was
developed by M. R. Liebowitz. The test measures
social phobia. Its psychometric properties have been
checked (Heimberg et al., 1999). It was run as volun-
tary in stable version 4 (S4).
3. MDQ, Mood Disorder Questionnaire (Hirschfeld
et al., 2000). The test measures Bipolar traits and was
run as voluntary in stable version 8 (S8).
4. The General Adult ADD Symptom Checklist that was
developed in 1995 by Dr. Daniel Amen, University of
California, Irvine School of Medicine (unpublished).
The test measures ADD symptoms in adults. It was
run as voluntary in stable version 9 (S9).
5. Vinegrad RevisedAdult Dyslexia Checklist (Vinegrad,
1994). The test measures dyslexia in adults. It was run
as voluntary in stable version 10 (S10).
6. Tourette Syndrome Diagnostic Confidence Index
(Robertson et al., 1999) was modified for self-assess-
ment. The test is used to identify Tourette syndrome
in a life-perspective and gives a score proportional to
severity. It was run as voluntary in stable version 11
(S11).
7. The Giftedness in Adults test that was developed by
Linda Kreger Silverman, the Gifted Development
Center (unpublished), was run as voluntary in stable
version 12 (S12).
8. The Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26; Garner, Olmsted,
Bohr, & Garfinkel, 1982). The test measures eating
disorders and was run as voluntary in neurodiversity
version 3 (N3).
In Final Version 1, the following professional instruments
were used to check the relation to neurodiversity:
1. AQ was run as voluntary in F1.
2. The short version of International Personality Item
Pool Representation of the NEO (IPIP NEO) that was
developed by Dr. John A. Johnson, Professor of
Psychology, Penn State University. Scoring

algorithms and factor loadings were acquired by per-
sonal communication. The test is a Big Five type per-
sonality test. It was run as voluntary in F2.
3. SPQ-A was run as mandatory in F6.
4. The General Adult ADD Symptom Checklist was run
as mandatory in F7.
5. LSAS was run as mandatory in F8.
6. Tourette Syndrome Diagnostic Confidence Index
was run as mandatory in F9.
7. Vinegrad Revised Adult Dyslexia Checklist was run
as mandatory in F10.
8. EQ,EmpathyQuotient(Baron-Cohen&Wheelwright,
2004), was run as mandatory in F12.
Grouping Traits
Initially, a particular item's relation to a group was calculated
by averaging intercorrelations to items in a group for the
item checked, excluding self-correlation. A report was used
that listed the correlation for all presently used items to all
presently used groups. The highest correlations (up to 90%
of the highest correlation) were listed in a particular color,
which made it easier to see misplaced items. This method
was effective when most of the items were already placed in
consistent groups, but often failed when novel groupings
were attempted.
To remedy this, a new method using a different approach
to factor analysis was developed to aid in creating novel
groups. The raw material used was changed so that items
with higher scores in the neurotypical group were inverted (a
0 score become a 2 score and the reverse). In the factor anal-
ysis program, data were centered to remove as much as pos-
sible of the primary factors related to neurodiversity. In this
configuration, the primary factor only explained about 22%
of the variance, and the secondary explained 3%, giving a
much better material for finding subfactors in the material.
To be relevant for the current groups, the factors were rotated
to maximize loadings on presently used groups. Using these
maximized factor loadings, an item's relation to a group
could be calculated and presented in an updated report that
used a mixture of the methods. These factor loadings were
also used to calculate group scores for participants.
Grouping of traits started with some arbitrary groups
based on diagnostic categories. After discovering the dual-
factor nature of the data set, it became desirable to try to
group traits in symmetrical Aspie and neurotypical groups.
After the spider diagram was introduced in the validation
phase, which has anAspie and neurotypical side, this became
even more desirable. This aim was realized with Final
Version 2 when the Aspie social group was finally con-
structed and validated to be reasonably consistent.
Ethical Issues
The research followed principles in human research accord-
ing to the Helsinki Declaration. As the study was performed
independent of an institution, there was no institutional
review board available. To comply with applicable ethical
requirements on research on human subjects, the study was
constructed in such a way that participants could not be iden-
tified. Participants got informed about the objectives of the
study, and had to indicate they accepted this before they
could fill out the survey.
Initially, the following text was presented to partici-
pants: "The goal of this test is to evaluate neurodiversity
traits in people with formal neuropsychiatric diagnosis
and self-diagnosed neurodiverse people to compare them
with people in the general population. The goal is to sur-
vey traits that currently are not believed to be part of the
neurodiversity/autism-spectrum. The goal is also to pub-
lish the result of the evaluation in a scientific journal.
Your answers will be saved in a database. To avoid mul-
tiple answers from the same person, IP-addresses will be
saved in a separate table, without a link to the quiz results.
Each IP could only enter one answer into the database. To
get to the quiz you must accept that your answers are
saved."
After removing the requirement to save IP addresses to
avoid multiple answers, and no longer doing research on new
traits, the text was changed to "Statistics/results are saved in
a database. The statistics might be published, used as
research-data or checked in order to calibrate the test. We do
not save IP addresses or other personal information."
Results
In January 2013, Aspie Quiz had tested about 1,800 different
items and had been answered about 550,000 times.
Factor Stability
A central issue in the construction of Aspie Quiz was the sta-
bility of the factors used for scoring. These factors were
required to be highly stable. Factor congruence coefficients
were calculated for the two first factors of PCA (neurodiver-
sity and neurotypical factor). Factor congruence coefficients
between phases are presented in Table 1. It can be seen that
Aspie Quiz converged as average factor congruence coeffi-
cients approached and exceed .99. In the final version, factor
congruence coefficients between releases, and even with dif-
ferent sets of items, are much larger than for instance factor
congruence coefficients between genders (Figure 2a) or age
groups (Figure 2b). This shows that the item selection pro-
cess was completed. Even in the very first versions, factor
congruence coefficients between disparate item selections
were high.
Factor Analysis Results
The 95% confidence interval for explained variance for all
versions was 63.2% to 65.2% for the neurodiversity factor,
4.8% to 5.6% for the neurotypical factor, and 1.0% to 1.2%
Ekblad 7
for the third factor. Analyzing males and females separately
gave overlapping 95% confidence intervals. Explained vari-
ance for neurodiversity factor was correlated .71 to male
neurodiversity rate (percentage of males that got "very likely
Aspie"). Explained variance for neurotypical factor was cor-
related .62 with number of items that neurotypicals scored
higher on.
In the final phase, the neurodiversity and neurotypical
factor loadings had no correlation, the neurodiversity and
third factor loadings had a .5 correlation, and the neurotypi-
cal and third factor loadings had no correlation.
Connections Between Measures
Explained variance seemed to relate to male neurodiversity
rate and to the number of neurotypical items. Another rela-
tion was between neurodiversity rate (and especially the
male rate, but also the female and overall) and explained
variance for neurodiversity factor. There were also relations
between number of neurotypical items and factor analysis
results, primarily explained variance for neurotypical factor,
but also for factor congruence coefficients. This indicates
that too few neurotypical items degrade factors.
Average Scores
Average scores per gender in Final Version 1 were Aspie
score 94 and neurotypical score 109 for males, and Aspie
score 103 and neurotypical score 103 for females.
Average scores per gender in Final Version 2 were Aspie
score 93 and neurotypical score 113 for males, and Aspie
score 107 and neurotypical score 102 for females. Aspie and
neurotypical scores had a -.96 correlation.
Note, by checking the middle alternative on all items, a
participant would get Aspie score 100 and neurotypical score
100.

generated by exporting frequencies of scores from Final
Versions 1 and 2, and H3 in five score intervals from -200
to 200. Scores do not seem to be normally distributed.
Attempting to match score distributions with a single bell
curve provided poor results. Instead, it seemed like the
score distributions were composed of two independent
overlapping bell curves.
The best match for the total data set gave 99.7%
explained variance for 10th-order polynomial, 99.4% for
dual bell curve, and 91.1% for single bell curve. For the
total diagnosed AS/HFA/PDD population, it gave 98.2%
for 10th-order polynomial, 98.1% for dual bell curve, and
92.6% for single bell curve. The average explained vari-
ance for all answers in 32 individual versions were 90.8%
for 10th-order polynomial, 90.3% for dual bell curve, and
79.6% for single bell curve. Conservative estimate and the-
oretical considerations (see "Discussion" section) favor the
dual bell curve.
Score Stability
Figure 4 shows score difference for registered users who did
Aspie Quiz twice. Most registered users have a small score
difference, but there are some outliers that seemed to have
manipulated their results.
When analyzing all registered users who did Aspie Quiz
twice, the average Aspie score difference was 17.1 and the
average neurotypical score difference was 17.6. By remov-
ing registered users who had more than 50 in root square sum
of Aspie and neurotypical score difference (104 registered
users out of 825), the average score difference decreases to
11.0 for Aspie score and 11.2 for neurotypical score.
When analyzing all registered users who did two different
versions of Aspie Quiz (n = 219), the average Aspie score
difference was 15.5 and the average neurotypical score dif-
ference was 15.8.
Retake Frequency
In the consolidation phase, there was a required item about
how many times participants had done the test in the past,
and 108 out of 711 participants indicated that they had done
the test before (15.2%).
Retake frequency could also be estimated by checking
user accounts. There were 18,639 answers saved by regis-
tered users. In all, 14,916 users had only entered a single
answer, 825 users had answered twice, while 361 users had
answered more than twice. This means that 7.4% of the reg-
istered users had done Aspie Quiz more than once. As the
reason for registering a user account was to be able to follow
up on score stability, this should be an upper limit for how
many answers are from the same individual.
Groups
Grouping of traits ended up with six symmetrical groups on
the Aspie (neurodiverse) and neurotypical side. The groups
were talent, compulsion, social, communication, hunting,
and perception. Figure 5 shows a typical Aspie profile in the
spider diagram used to present results to participants.
Prevalence of Neurodiversity
Because of the way participants were recruited, it was not
possible to directly calculate prevalence of neurodiversity in
the general population. Rate of neurodiversity in the final
version was around 30% for males and around 40% for
females. Some referrer links recorded in Aspie Quiz with
many participants showed as low rates as 10% to 15%. A
guess is that the rate in the general population might be 10%
to 15%. The much higher average scores in the total popula-
tion is indicative that participants' own feelings about being
different was an important factor when people decided to do
Aspie Quiz or not.

users who did Aspie Quiz twice. Figure 5. An example of an Aspie profile in the spider diagram.

Figure 6 shows that most participants were young males.
The age distribution seemed similar to how the number of
ASD diagnoses had increased during recent years (King &
Bearman, 2009). The primary group that took Aspie Quiz
was young people, presumably because of increased aware-
ness and that most people diagnosed with ASD are young.
Figure 7 shows the neurodiversity rate per gender and
birth year (5-year intervals). The neurodiversity rate seems
to be stable and not related to year of birth.
Gender Bias in Prevalence
A data set with no gender bias in participation was required
to study a possible gender bias. The data set selected included
only people born up until 1970 from Final Version 2. It con-
tained 15,127 males and 14,205 females (1.06:1 ratio). In all,
36% of the males scored as neurodiverse, while 34% of the
females scored as neurodiverse. It therefore seemed like nei-
ther interest rate nor neurodiversity rate was related to
gender for people born up until 1970. Additional evidence
for the absence of a gender bias comes from the fact that
male:female gender ratio for all participants correlated .84
with female:male gender ratio of participants that scored as
neurodiverse, indicating that a bias in male participation
resulted in a similar bias in fewer males scoring as neurodi-
verse. It seems likely that the lower scores and higher partici-
pation rate of young males is a cultural issue that is related to
popular beliefs about ASD.
Racial Bias in Prevalence
The U.S. sample was used to study the racial prevalence
because the proportion of different ethnic groups is well
known from U.S. census information. Table 2 presents ances-
try information for the U.S. sample for Final Phases 1 and 2.
Native American Indians had higher than expected participa-
tion rates and higher neurodiversity rate in all three data sets.
Asians had the expected participation rate, but lower neuro-
diversity rates in all three data sets. People ofAfrican descent
had only about 1/5th of the expected participation rate, but a
similar neurodiversity rate in all three data sets. These differ-
ences were significant at p < .05 in each of the data sets.
Racial Differences in Factors
Table 3 presents factor analysis results for various popula-
tions. Native American Indians, in the United States, and as
a total group, had higher than expected explained variance
for the neurodiversity factor in both data sets. Asians had
lower than expected explained variance for the neurodiver-
sity factor. Africans and Europeans were intermediate.
Neurodiversity Contribution to DSM Diagnoses
and Personality
It was found that many professional tests correlated to Aspie
score difference. These were initially run during the valida-
tion phase, and then rerun in the final phase. Results for the
validation phase are listed in Table 4 and results for the final
phase are listed in Table 5. The AQ test had the highest
correlation.
Another way to analyze neurodiversity contribution to
DSM diagnoses was to check neurodiversity rate for people
who had indicated they had been diagnosed with various
DSM diagnoses. In Final Version 2 (H3), 63% of diagnosed
ASD, 62% of diagnosed Social Phobia, 56% of diagnosed
OCD, and 44% of diagnosed ADD/ADHD scored as neuro-
diverse. In all, 28% of the participants scored as neurodi-
verse in this data set, which indicates that all of these
diagnoses had considerably higher neurodiversity rates than
the average rate.
A traditional personality test correlated well with Aspie
Quiz scores. The IPIP NEO Big Five personality question-
naire had two factors that were highly correlated to Aspie

score, the extraversion factor and the neuroticism factor. The
conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness factors had
small (but significant; Table 5) negative correlations to Aspie
score. It was also found that the factor structure of Aspie
Quiz was more stable than the factor structure of IPIP NEO.
There was a .9 factor congruence coefficient between the
factor analysis of only the Aspie Quiz part compared with
analyzing the Aspie Quiz part and the IPIP NEO part. This

means that a significant part of the traits researched in per-
sonality research are related to neurodiversity.
Comparing Aspie Quiz With AQ
The Autism-Spectrum Quotient or AQ test measures autistic
traits in adults. To compare the AQ test with Aspie Quiz it
was necessary to administer both tests to the same popula-
tion. This was first done in the consolidation phase (n = 684).
Analysis gave a correlation between AQ score and Aspie
score of .81, a correlation between AQ score and neurotypi-
cal score of -.84, and a correlation between AQ score and
score difference of .83. In all, 81% of diagnosed AS/HFA
scored above the cutoff in the AQ test compared with 75% in
Aspie Quiz (6% difference). A total of 66% of all males
scored above the cutoff in the AQ test compared with 58% in
Aspie Quiz (8% difference). A total of 50% of all females
scored above the cutoff in the AQ test compared with 43% in
Aspie Quiz (7% difference).
The AQ test consistently gave higher scores in all groups
(but primarily in the whole group and the male group).
A second attempt to compare the AQ test with Aspie Quiz
was done in the Final Version 1. Out of 2,525 people, 715 did
the Aspie Quiz and the AQ test. This resulted in the same
correlations between scores as in the consolidation phase.
Using DataFit's linear regression analysis between AQ
test score and various Aspie Quiz scores from the Final
Version 1 gave the following equations for converting the
AQ test score to Aspie Quiz scores:
Aspie score = 17.7 + 3.2 × AQ
Neurotypical score = 193.5 - 3.4 × AQ
Score difference = -175.8 + 6.6 × AQ
In an evaluation of theAQ test (Woodbury-Smith, Robinson,
& Baron-Cohen, 2005), control group 2 scored on average
16.4. Recalculating this score to Aspie Quiz scores using
the above formulas gave Aspie score 70 and neurotypical
score 138. In Aspie Quiz' neurotypical control group, 95%
average confidence interval for 32 versions is [75, 79] for
Aspie score and [122, 128] for the neurotypical score. This
means that Group 2 in the AQ test evaluation is slightly
more neurotypical than Aspie Quiz' neurotypical control
group.
Baron-Cohen suggested an AQ score of 32 or above
should be considered an indication of autism (Baron-Cohen
et al., 2001). A recalculation of this AQ score to Aspie Quiz
score difference give 35, which is the current cutoff for being
neurodiverse in Aspie Quiz.
In a later paper (Woodbury-Smith et al., 2005), it was sug-
gested that a cutoff at 26 was optimal. This corresponds to an
Aspie Quiz score difference of -4. The cutoff to neurotypical

in Aspie Quiz was set to -35 for symmetry reasons. The
range between -34 and 34 was judged as mixed in Aspie
Quiz.
Using the above cutoffs, it was possible to calculate mis-
matches between professional AS/HFA/PDD diagnosis and
Aspie Quiz results. In Final Version 1, 13% of diagnosed AS/
HFA/PDD tested as neurotypical, 21% as mixed, and 66% as
neurodiverse (n = 5,141). In Final Version 2, 15% of diag-
nosed AS/HFA/PDD tested as neurotypical, 24% as mixed,
and 61% as neurodiverse (n = 4,965).
When comparing results between the AQ test and Aspie
Quiz, the following was observed:
59% of diagnosed AS/HFA/PDD scored above the cutoff
in the AQ test compared with 70% in Aspie Quiz (11%
difference)
42% of all males scored above the cutoff in the AQ test
compared with 46% in Aspie Quiz (4% difference)
45% of all females scored above the cutoff in the AQ test
compared with 50% in Aspie Quiz (5% difference)
16% in the neurotypical control group scored above the
cutoff in theAQ test compared with 19% inAspie Quiz
(3% difference)
Aspie Quiz consistently gave higher scores in all groups
(but primarily in the diagnosed and female group and to a
lesser extent in the whole group and the control group).
These findings seem to show that Aspie Quiz has different
properties than the AQ test, which is expected when they
were constructed with different goals in mind. Some of the
properties of professional diagnosis, like more males receiv-
ing ASD diagnoses, seem to be reflected in the AQ test, but
not in Aspie Quiz.
Problems With Online Questionnaires
There are potential problems with data quality when using
online questionnaires. As Aspie Quiz has become a popular
self-test in the autistic community, many people there today
know how to get low or high scores on Aspie Quiz. This
could cause biased results, but fortunately, only a minority of
the answers seem to come from the autistic community In
Final Version 1, 2,540 participants (2.9%) came from the
popular wrongplanet.net site, which was the major contribu-
tor from the autistic community. In Final Version 2, 4,146
participants were from wrongplanet.net (2.4%). It therefore
seems likely that only a minority of the participants in the
Final Version 1 came from the autistic community, and that
even fewer did in the Final Version 2.AsAspie Quiz contains
many novel questions with unknown linkage to Autism
Spectrum Conditions (ASC) outside of the autistic commu-
nity, this increases chances of truthful answers. Other prob-
lems include participants not being honest, leaving items
unchecked, or tending to answer positively (or negatively)
on everything to get the scores they want. These problems
were addressed with control items and requiring certain
number of items to be answered. Results indicated that these
methods worked.
Further Details and Data
Detailed results from the software-generated evaluation used
to construct Aspie Quiz can be found at http://www.rdos.net/
eng/aspeval. The source code can be found in a SVN reposi-
tory at http://rdos.net/vc/viewvc.cgi/trunk/aspie-quiz/
Discussion
The aim of Aspie Quiz was to find a way to score neurodiver-
sity traits in a novel way, independent of diagnostic catego-
ries. The actual diversity of the items used was not planned in
advance, rather was discovered in the construction process.
The main idea was to find traits. To exclude environmental
problems, a group of common environmental problems were
used to spot issues closely related to environment.
Aspie Quiz defines the terms Aspie (neurodiverse) and
neurotypical itself, based on factor analysis. This is not cir-
cular as traits were not selected based on diagnostic criteria,
or based on prevalent stereotypes, but in an automatic item
selection process. The result that the Aspie Quiz neurodiver-
sity definition maps well to ASD diagnosis and the AQ test is
because ASDs are based on the same traits as those that got
selected in Aspie Quiz, and not because of how Aspie Quiz
was constructed.
Aspie Quiz' neurodiversity definition might differ from
the traditional definition, which is not based on scientific
research, but on people's opinions. In addition to defining
neurodiversity, Aspie Quiz also defines neurotypical func-
tion. About half of the traits define neurodiversity, while the
other half defines neurotypical function. Often, neurotypical
traits are described in terms of problems or absence of func-
tion. The intention is that the traits in Aspie Quiz should rep-
resent evolved traits, and problems can never evolve. Instead,
some traits could have evolved in the neurotypical population
and then be absent in the neurodiverse population, causing
problems in a culture based on neurotypical preferences. For
example, having problems with verbal instructions is placed
in the neurotypical talent group, implying that being good (or
average) with verbal instructions is an evolved neurotypical
trait, and having problems with verbal instructions is the
absence of this trait. For social and communication traits, the
picture is slightly different. Here there really is no absence of
traits, but rather the social and communication issues related
to neurodiversity are pure differences. The absence of typical
social and communication traits are the central issues in ASD
diagnosis, but the presence of other social and communica-
tion traits is not considered, which means that many of these
traits are virtually unknown of. It took a lot of effort to pro-
duce the symmetric neurodiverse and neurotypical social and
Ekblad 13
communication groups because these traits are differences
rather than presence/absence of function.
Aspie Quiz does not support the idea that neurodiversity is
similar to Asperger's syndrome or the entire autism spectrum.
To begin with, it was the intention to produce a test that could
predict an Asperger's syndrome diagnosis, but when the dual-
factor nature of the material was discovered, this aim was
dropped. The term Aspie was retained as that term was thought
to represent the positive aspects ofAsperger's syndrome rather
than the negative aspects described in DSM. In the final form,
Aspie Quiz'Aspie category maps pretty well with the ordinary
neurodiversity definition that includes ASD, ADD/ADHD,
Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Dyspraxia, and Tourette syndrome, as
is evidenced by the correlations scores on professional tests
for these conditions have with Aspie Quiz scores.
The idea that neurodiversity/autistic traits lie on the
extreme end of a normal distribution is not supported by
Aspie Quiz, rather the neurodiversity traits seem to have its
own normal distribution overlapping the normal distribution
of typical traits. This property was also reflected in the fact
that factor analysis produced two factors rather than a single
factor. The scores based on these two factors were almost
inverse, implying that the traits involved in typical function
and neurodiverse function are mutually exclusive. The two
factors combined explained 70% of the variance, and thus of
human diversity, leaving only 30% for other types of varia-
tion in the traits used in Aspie Quiz.
Conclusion
The study found support for the usefulness of Aspie Quiz as
a tool to assess neurodiversity in an unbiased manner. Aspie
Quiz neither has a gender bias nor an age bias in key psycho-
metric properties, like traditional ASD-related test and
screening procedures have, which makes it suitable to assess
neurodiversity.
The data from Aspie Quiz contradict the view that neuro-
diversity is a cultural or social construct, as all the traits are
correlated to each other, pointing to an inherited rather than
social component. The absence of other major factors of
human variation in the factor analysis of Aspie Quiz speaks
against the idea that neurodiversity is one of the many pos-
sible dimensions of human diversity, rather pointing to neu-
rodiversity being the major component of human diversity.
The connection to traditional personality traits agrees with
this interpretation.
