Context: Although the rise in overweight and obesity in the United States is well documented, long-term weight loss
maintenance (LTWLM) has been minimally explored.
Objective: The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence and correlates of LTWLM among US adults.
Design, setting and participants: We examined weight data from 14 306 participants (age 20­84 years) in the 1999­2006
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We defined LTWLM as weight loss maintained for at least 1 year.
We excluded individuals who were not overweight or obese at their maximum weight.
Results: Among US adults who had ever been overweight or obese, 36.6, 17.3, 8.5 and 4.4% reported LTWLM of at least 5, 10,
15 and 20%, respectively. Among the 17.3% of individuals who reported an LTWLM of at least 10%, the average and median
weight loss maintained was 19.1 kg (42.1 pounds) and 15.5 kg (34.1 pounds), respectively. LTWLM of at least 10% was higher
among adults of ages 75­84 years (vs ages 20­34, adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2, 1.8), among
those who were non-Hispanic white (vs Hispanic, adjusted OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.0) and among those who were female
(vs male, adjusted OR: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.3).
Conclusions: More than one out of every six US adults who has ever been overweight or obese has accomplished LTWLM of at
least 10%. This rate is significantly higher than those reported in clinical trials and many other observational studies, suggesting
that US adults may be more successful at sustaining weight loss than previously thought.

Introduction
The obesity epidemic in the United States is a significant
public health concern. Two-thirds of the US adult popula-
tion is overweight or obese with a body mass index (BMI)
X25, and the prevalence of obesity (BMI X30) has doubled
between 1980 and 2004.1­3 This continued rise in over-
weight and obesity increases the population's risks of several
obesity-related illnesses, such as type 2 diabetes and
hypertension.4­6 Modest weight loss treatment targets of
5­10% of initial body weight are recommended based on the
evidence that morbidity and mortality are significantly lower
at this level, although any intentional weight loss improves
health in patients with comorbidities.7,8
Helping patients lose weight and keep it off, however,
remains a vexing public health problem. On average,
current state-of-the-art behavioral weight loss programs
produce weight losses of 10% of initial body weight over
30 weeks.9,10 Although many patients have weight regain,
some individuals are successful at both losing weight and
maintaining this weight loss over the long term. The
identification of individuals who are able to achieve long-
term weight loss maintenance (LTWLM) may allow for
further development of interventions to aid others in
maintaining weight loss.
Despite the wealth of data on obesity rates and efficacy of
clinical trials of weight loss treatments, little information

exists about the epidemiology of individuals achieving
LTWLM. Much of the data to address this issue come from
two sources: published clinical trials and the National
Weight-Control Registry (NWCR).11,12 The NWCR is a
database of individuals who were recruited initially based
on their being able to lose at least 13.6 kg of their body
weight (average, 30 kg) and keep it off for at least 1 year
(average, 5 years).11 The NWCR, however, is not population
based and is therefore not useful for providing estimates of
LTWLM in the United States.11
The goals of this study were to provide nationally
representative estimates and correlates of LTWLM among
US adults. On the basis of the evidence that loss of at least
10% consistently produce beneficial changes to health-risk
factors, we defined LTWLM as losing 10% of maximum body
weight and keeping it off for at least 1 year.7,12
Subjects and methods
We analyzed data from the 1999­2006 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), an annual survey
evaluating the health and nutrition of a representative
portion of the US population. We included surveys from
years 1999 to 2006 because 1999 was the first year when the
weight history questionnaire was added to NHANES. The
data were collected through in-home interviews using a
standard questionnaire, which has been described in pre-
vious studies.13
Weight status and weight history were evaluated using
several self-reported measures. Self-reported measures were
used because measured weight was only available for
individuals' current weight, not their maximum weight or
weight 1 year ago. Maximum weight was assessed by the
question, `Up to the present time, what is the most you have
ever weighed?'; weight 1 year ago by, `How much did you
weigh a year ago?'; current weight by, `How much do you
weigh without clothes or shoes?'; and current height by,
`How tall are you without shoes?' The question that assessed
maximum weight asked women to exclude maximum
weights during pregnancy. Individuals who lost at least
10 pounds in the previous year were asked, `Was the change
between your current weight and your weight a year ago
intentional?' BMI was calculated by dividing the partici-
pant's self-reported weight in kilograms by the self-reported
height in meters squared. These values were then classified
into six standard BMI categories, o18.5, 18.5 to o25, 25
to o30, 30 to o35, 35 to o40 and X40, using standard
National Institutes of Health cut-points.
For this study, we calculated whether or not each
individual had achieved 5, 10, 15 or 20% LTWLM, based
on the self-reported maximum weight, weight 1 year ago and
current weight. For example, for an individual to meet the
criterion of X5% LTWLM, an individual's weight 1 year ago,
as well as their current weight, would have to be X5% less
than their maximum weight.
The demographic variables analyzed included gender, age,
race/ethnicity, education level and marital status, according
to standard NHANES categories. Weight-related variables
included current BMI categories, years since the maximum
weight and current weight-control status (attempting to lose
and maintain weight, attempting to lose weight only,
attempting to maintain weight only and neither attempting
to lose nor maintain weight). We also included several health
questions taken from NHANES, including the diabetes
questionnaire, blood pressure and cholesterol questionnaire,
and current health status questionnaire including high
cholesterol (yes, no), hypertension (yes, no), diabetes (yes,
no) and overall health (poor, fair, good, very good,
excellent).
Participants were excluded if their maximum BMI was
o25, if they were under the age of 20 or over 84 years. The
final sample size included 14 306 individuals. Data were
weighted according to the NHANES analytical guidelines to
account for the complex sampling design and were analyzed
using weighted methods, primarily bivariate and multi-
variate logistic regression, with SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute
Inc, Cary, NC, USA; 2002­2003). All data presented in the
tables represent weighted analyses and reflect nationally
representative estimates.
Results
Demographic and weight-control characteristics of 14 306
US adults who were ever overweight or obese, representing
74.6% of the total 1996­2006 NHANES population, are
shown in Table 1. The population included almost equal
numbers of men (52.3%) and women (47.7%), and included
71.7% non-Hispanic white, 12.5% Hispanic and 11.8% non-
Hispanic black participants. Approximately half (53.7%) of
the adults completed more than a high school education
and nearly two-third (66.6%) were married or living with a
partner. In terms of overall health, the majority of indivi-
duals reported `good' (32.1%), `very good' (29.9%) or
`excellent' health (19.5%). However, losing weight was a
current goal for only one-third of individuals, despite the
fact that 82.6% of individuals were either overweight or
obese.
Overall, among US adults who have ever been overweight
or obese, 36.5, 17.3, 8.5 and 4.4%, respectively, have
maintained a weight loss of at least 5, 10, 15 and 20%
(Table 2). Further description of the individuals who make
up these groups can be found in Table 2. Table 3 shows
variables associated with LTWLM of at least 10% in the
bivariate and multivariate analyses. Participant characteris-
tics that were found to be statistically significant in bivariate
analyses (age, gender, race, education, marital status, current
BMI and diabetes) were used as covariates in the adjusted
analyses.
After adjusting for these demographics, the results of this
population demonstrated that (1) women, (2) older adults

(age 75­84 years), (3) non-Hispanic whites and (4) those with
less than a high school education had a higher prevalence of
LTWLM, whereas (5) married or partnered individuals had a
lower prevalence of LTWLM. Women had a higher preva-
lence of LTWLM of at least 10% compared with men (19.2 vs
15.6%; odds ratio (OR) ¼ 1.2; 95% confidence interval
(CI) ¼ 1.1­1.3). Adults with the age of 75­84 years also had
greater LTWLM compared with those of 20­34 years (29.3 vs
15.2%; OR ¼ 1.5; 95% CI 1.2­1.8). In addition, non-Hispanic
whites had a higher prevalence of LTWLM when compared
with Hispanic individuals (18.6 vs 12.9%; OR ¼ 1.6; 95% CI
1.3­2.0). Those individuals with less than a high school
education also had a higher proportion of LTWLM of at least
10% when compared with individuals with more than a high
school education (19.3 vs 16.1%; OR ¼ 1.3; 95% CI 1.1­1.5).
Finally, participants who were married or living with a
partner had a lower prevalence of LTWLM when compared
with those who were never married (15.4 vs 17.8; OR ¼ 0.7;
95% CI 0.6­0.8) or widowed or divorced or separated (15.4 vs
24.5; OR ¼ 0.6; 95% CI 0.5­0.8).
Weight was also associated with achieving LTWLM of
at least 10%. Adjusted analyses found a higher prevalence
of weight maintenance in individuals with a BMI o25 or
25­30 (42.2 vs 13.3%; OR ¼ 9.4 and 2.0, respectively;
Po0.001) compared with those with a BMI X40. However,
individuals with a maximum BMI of X40 had a higher
prevalence of LTWLM than those with a BMI in the
overweight range (OR ¼ 2.1; Po0.001). A greater number of
years since maximum weight was also strongly associated
with current LTWLM of at least 10%, with individuals who
had reached their maximum weight 410 years ago having
30.9 greater odds than those who weighed their heaviest less
than 2 years ago (Po0.001). Current weight-control goals
were no longer associated with LTWLM in the adjusted
analyses.

Health status was also associated with achieving LTWLM
of at least 10%. One-fourth of individuals who reported
having diabetes experienced LTWLM compared with 16.5%
of individuals without diabetes (OR ¼ 2.1; Po0.001). Indivi-
duals who reported poor overall health had higher rates of
LTWLM than those who reported their health as excellent
(34.1 vs 17.5%; OR ¼ 2.3; Po0.001). Older participants and
those with diabetes were significantly more likely to rate
their overall health as poor (Po0.001).
Among those who reported losing at least 10 pounds in the
previous year, 69.0% reported that the loss was intentional
(Table 4). Weight loss was more likely to be intentional in
younger individuals, females, non-Hispanic whites, those
with greater than a high school education, a history of
diabetes or better overall health. Intentional weight loss was
less prevalent in the 75­84 year olds as compared with all the
other age groups (OR ¼ 0.2; Po0.001). In addition, indivi-
duals who rated their health as `poor' were less likely to have
intentional weight loss when compared with those whose
health was rated as `excellent' (OR ¼ 3.1; Po0.001).
The average and median amounts of weight lost by those
individuals with LTWLM of at least 10% was B19.1 and
15.5 kg, respectively. Figure 1 shows the distribution of
weight lost by these individuals. The average current weight
of individuals with LTWLM of at least 10% was 78.4 kg and
their mean age was 49.5 years (Table 5). Individuals reported
an average of 14.8 years since they had weighed their
maximum weight. Despite losing at least 10% of their
maximum weight and maintaining this loss for 41 year,
individuals with LTWLM remained overweight with an
average BMI of 27.
Table 5 additionally presents a comparison of NHANES
participants from our study who have achieved LTWLM of at
least 10% with participants from the NWCR.11 Overall, the
NHANES participants were older (49.5 vs 45.3 years), less
educated and were more likely to be male (47.1 vs 18.8%). In
addition, there were significantly more minority members
in NHANES as compared with NWCR (10.3 vs 1.4% non-
Hispanic African Americans and 9.3 vs 1.1% Hispanics).
Participants in the NWCR lost more weight than the
NHANES participants (30.0 vs 19.1 kg), although both groups
were similar in maximum weights (99.9 vs 97.5 kg).
Discussion
Our results demonstrate that a significant percentage of US
adults are able to lose weight and keep it off. One in three
(36.5%) ever-overweight or obese US adults has had LTWLM
of at least 5% of their body weight, a population which
includes 74.6% of the total NHANES sample from 1999­
2006. On average, these individuals achieved a weight loss of
13.2 kg. This finding is in contrast to clinical trials that show
less weight loss maintenance success. Though few interven-
tion studies follow individuals for longer than 1­2 years,
B10­20% of subjects in clinical trials are able to maintain a
loss of at least 5% for X5 years.12 The Diabetes Prevention
Program showed that B37% of participants maintained a
weight loss of at least 7%, or an average of B6.0 kg, after 3
years.14 Meta-analyses of weight loss intervention studies
found that individuals in the experimental arms of clinical
trials are able to lose and maintain an average of 3.0 kg or
3.2% of their original body weight for at least 2 years.15,16
There are multiple potential explanations for finding a
higher proportion of US adults accomplishing LTWLM than

those reported in clinical trials and other observational
studies. First, individuals who participate in clinical trials
may be less likely to have long-term success, possibly because
this is a selected population.17 Second, some of the current
weight loss experienced in our estimates includes uninten-
tional weight loss. Third, there may be a substantial number
of individuals who may experience weight gain during a
particular time in their life but manage to return to a normal
weight, such as those who gain the `freshman 15' when
entering college. Given the brevity of such experiences, these
individuals would be less likely to be included in clinical
trials, but would be captured in our analysis. Finally, we
report on individuals who maintain a weight loss of 45%
below their maximum weight, whereas clinical trials will
often capture participants who maintain weight below their
baseline weight upon entry into the trial. Again, clinical
trials will be less likely to capture individuals at their
maximum weight.
LTWLM was more common among women, older adults,
individuals who reported poor overall health and those with
less than a high school education. We observed that 19.1% of
women vs 15.6% of men (Po0.0001) were able to achieve
LTWLM of at least 10% and that recent weight losses were
more likely to be intentional for women. This variation in
LTWLM by gender may occur as a result of different uses of
weight-control behaviors. Neumark-Sztainer et al.18 observed
that women were more likely than men to report dieting and
using each of the 23 weight-control practices surveyed,
supporting our observation that LTWLM was more common
in women. Although we found that LTWLM was more
common in older adults (age 75­84 years), this population
was more likely to have unintentional weight loss. In
addition, patients with diabetes had a higher prevalence of
LTWLM. This is encouraging, but not surprising, given the
consistent recommendations from the American Diabetes
Association and other professional organizations for patients
with type 2 diabetes to lose weight.19 In addition, individuals
with diabetes were much more likely to report poor health,
which was also associated with LTWLM. Individuals with less
than a high school education also had a higher prevalence of
LTWLM. Further research is necessary to examine the reason
why these individuals are more successful with LTWLM.
An interesting finding was that 480% of the US adults
who were overweight or obese reported their health as
`good', `very good' or `excellent'. This finding is despite a
significant percentage of individuals with hypertension
(82%) and/or hyperlipidemia (42%). Obesity has been shown
to have a negative impact on self-rated health among adults,
even in the absence of comorbidities.20­22 However, this
population does have a percentage of participants who are
currently overweight (45.6%), which has been shown to be
associated with a slight reduction of self-rated health.20,23 In
addition, 17.4% of individuals were normal weight, which
would not be expected to influence overall reported health.
We also found that only one in three individuals had a
current weight-control goal to lose weight. Health-related
quality of life, or more generally, health status, have been
found to influence weight loss effort.24­26 This raises
concerns for the potential implications of overweight and
obese individuals with positively rated health and their
resultant motivation to lose weight. However, multiple
factors influence weight loss motivation, especially in
women, including appearance24,26 and body image.24 There-
fore, it is not entirely surprising that a minority of
individuals were attempting to lose weight.
Physician advice also has an important role in the decision
to lose weight.24 Therefore, it is important for health
professionals to understand the true prevalence of long-term
weight loss, as it may help to change the underlying beliefs
and influence clinical practice. Foster and colleagues ob-
served that physicians rated the treatment of obesity as
significantly less effective than therapies for 9 of 10 other

chronic conditions, such as asthma and diabetes.27 Tsui
et al.28 observed that only one-quarter (27%) of physicians
were confident in their weight loss counseling skills.
Sciamanna et al.29 found that fewer than half (47.3%) of
the obese patients with a weight-related comorbidity (for
example, hypertension) reported having received advice to
lose weight in the previous year from a health-care profes-
sional. Although these studies did not directly measure the
belief that patients could actually lose weight and keep it off,
they suggest physicians may not believe offering weight loss
advice and counseling is a worthwhile activity in clinical
practice. An awareness of our findings may encourage health
professionals to pursue weight loss counseling for over-
weight patients.
In addition to informing health-care providers, identifica-
tion of a significant percentage of the population that is
attempting and succeeding in some weight loss may be an
important target population for weight maintenance pro-
grams. Although the amounts lost are modest, if a sub-
stantial number of individuals achieved such losses, it would
have a significant public health effect. Particularly, those
individuals who have lost at least 5% and kept it off (one in
three ever-overweight Americans) may represent a unique
opportunity to reach a target population who has had some
success but could benefit from greater weight loss efforts.
There are several potential limitations to this study. First,
this is a single time point study and we only have
information of individuals' current, maximum and weight
1 year ago. Therefore, we cannot determine the total
duration of weight loss maintenance. In addition, we are
unable to note whether individuals have experienced weight
regain or weight cycling. For example, someone with a

maximum weight of 100 kg, who weighed 75 kg 2 years ago
and currently weighs 85 kg would be classified as achieving
LTWLM of 410%. However, it can be argued that this
individual still remains more successful at weight loss than
he or she was at their maximum weight.
A second limitation is we were not able to determine the
method of weight loss. Therefore, the data may include
individuals with unintentional weight lost from illness. One
in three individuals with LTWLM of at least 10% reported
their health as poor. Given the cross-sectional nature of this
study, we are unable to determine when the weight loss
occurred with respect to the individual's health. In addition,
we cannot determine whether those individuals with large
amounts of weight loss had undergone bariatric surgery.
Increasingly, surgery is a popular option for weight loss in
overweight individuals. The number of people overall who
undergo weight loss surgery, however, remains too small to
affect our results. In 2002, rates of gastric bypass surgery were
only 38.6 per 100 000. Despite an increase in surgical rates,
we did not observe an increase in LTWLM over time.30
Another potential limitation is that the data are self-
reported and therefore are subjected to recall problems in
addition to over- and underestimation. Casey et al., however,
reported that recall of past weight is relatively stable over
time and was affected by a mean underestimation of 1.98 kg
for men and 1.86 kg for women. Stevens et al.32 observed a
correlation between reported and measured weights of 0.98
for current weight, 0.94 for weight 4 years ago and 0.82 for
weight 28 years ago. We expect some degree of inaccurate
data reported but, based on the available data supporting the
accuracy of current and past weight reporting, these
inaccuracies are unlikely to affect the main observations.
A major strength of this study is the use of a large,
nationally representative sampling of LTWLM in US adults.
We are aware of only a few studies that have examined the
epidemiology of LTWLM in US adults. One study, limited to
women in Iowa, examined weight loss that occurred
between the ages of 18­30 years and evaluated for main-
tenance of this weight loss (±5%) between the ages of 30
and 50 years.33 Using this narrow definition, investigators
observed that only 1.6% of the total sample was classified as
having achieved LTWLM.33 A second study, by McGuire
et al.34, examined the rate of LTWLM in a random-digit-dial
survey that included only individuals who were ever over-
weight. One in five (20.6%) of the adults in the study
intentionally lost at least 10% of their maximum weight and
kept it off for at least 1 year. In comparison to the NWCR
participants, a selected group of individuals recruited for
their weight loss and maintenance efforts, NHANES offers a
population-based sample and insight on estimates of
LTWLM in the United States.11 Although Weiss et al.13 also
examined the NHANES population, their work focused
largely on weight regain and only includes participants from
the years 1999­2002.
In conclusion, more than one-sixth of individuals who has
ever been overweight and obese are able to lose and maintain
long-term 10% weight loss, a success rate significantly better
than those reported in weight loss clinical trials. Although
we find this information encouraging, it remains clear that
the great majority of individuals who are overweight are not
able to lose much weight and keep it off for the long term.
This suggests that the majority of Americans will be unable
to maintain a significant amount of weight loss without a
significant change in either the efficacy or availability of
weight loss and weight maintenance interventions. Further
investigation of the LTWLM methods of individuals who are
able to achieve success may reveal important knowledge
relevant to the creation of successful weight maintenance
interventions.
