Commentary
As a charitable research foundation, the Wellcome Trust is
strongly committed to ensuring that the outputs of the
research we support--including research publications and
data--can be accessed and used in a manner that delivers
the greatest possible benefit to global health. In common
with other research funders around the world, we believe
that many of the increasingly rich and complex datasets that
are generated by the research we support have to date been
largely untapped resources of considerable value. Through
making these data more widely accessible and useable to
other researchers, they can be used to advance avenues of
research that were never envisaged by the original data gen-
erator, as well as to verify published research findings.
In this light, many funders have introduced explicit poli-
cies on data management and sharing that require the
researchers we support to maximize access to datasets in a
timely and appropriate manner and with as few restrictions
as possible (Wykstra, 2013). In implementing their policies,
funders are aware that there are significant challenges to
overcome. Different research disciplines are at very differ-
ent stages in terms of developing the infrastructures,
resources, and skillsets needed to manage and share data.
Some sections of the research community have been much
quicker to embed data sharing practices than others, and
across the research enterprise, incentive structures do not
yet recognize adequately the cost and effort required to gen-
erate and make available high quality data resources.
Furthermore, for many areas of biomedical research that
involve the collection of data from patients and populations,
limits on data sharing are required to safeguard the privacy
of research participants.
Public health and epidemiology research has been high-
lighted as an area in which tremendous benefits could be
gained from data sharing, but where the community has
been relatively slow to embrace it and where key enabling
infrastructures are not yet in place (Pisani & AbouZahr,
2010). This is in part the result of some justifiable barriers
and concerns (van Panhuis et
al., 2014). In particular,
researchers who invest significant time and effort in com-
piling large-scale long-term datasets from cohorts and pop-
ulations are understandably reluctant to share these data
before they have had sufficient time to conduct and publish
their own analyses. This concern is amplified for research-
ers in resource-poor settings, where fears are particularly
acute that the benefits will be lost to better resourced groups
with enhanced capacity for data analysis. There may also be
particular ethical risks to individuals and populations in
these settings who may be at heightened risk of stigmatiza-
tion or harm if their privacy is compromised.

Sharing Research Data to
Improve Public Health:
A Funder Perspective
David Carr1 and Katherine Littler1
Abstract
Through the Public Health Research Data Forum, global health research funders are working together to increase the
availability of public health and epidemiology research data in ways that are equitable, ethical, and efficient. The Wellcome
Trust funded the research reported in this special edition as a first step toward building an evidence base on the perspectives
of research stakeholders in low- and middle-income countries on the benefits and challenges of sharing health research
data. We hope this work will make a key contribution to discussions aimed at creating policy frameworks for data access
at local, national, and regional levels that are sensitive to different contexts and ensure the benefits to research and health
are realized in an equitable manner.

While recognizing the need to address these concerns,
we would argue that there is an "ethical imperative" to sup-
port data sharing to ensure that datasets collected at consid-
erable expense using public and charitable research funds
are used in a manner that achieves the greatest possible ben-
efit to health and society. Following a lengthy period of dis-
cussion and debate, a group of 17 global health research
funders from across the world came together in 2011 to
publish a joint statement of purpose on sharing research
data to improve public health (Walport & Brest, 2011). The
statement articulated a shared vision to increase the avail-
ability of health research data in ways that are equitable,
ethical, and efficient and will accelerate improvements in
public health.
To advance this vision, the partner funders established
the Public Health Research Data Forum (www.wellcome.
ac.uk/PHRDF) as a mechanism to help coordinate funder
activities and develop joint activities to further the goals of
the joint statement. Over the last 3 years, the Forum has
commissioned several major projects to investigate key
issues and challenges associated with increasing the avail-
ability and use of health research data--publishing reports
on data citation (Rans, Day, Duke, & Ball, 2013), enhanc-
ing data discoverability (Public Health Research Data
Forum, 2014), and enabling data linkage (Public Health
Research Data Forum, 2015).
Forum partners have been aware from the outset that it
will be vital to build and maintain the trust and support of
all the stakeholders involved in the research process. These
include researchers who generate and wish to use data,
research institutions, local ethical review bodies, and criti-
cally, the research participants and populations who are
making their data available for research. We are also very
mindful that the policy and governance frameworks that are
required to achieve this may be highly context-dependent--
recognizing that the way our policy requirements are imple-
mented in practice needs to be adapted in line with the
varying values and cultural norms that exist in different set-
tings across the world.
From an early stage in the Forum's existence, it became
clear that while we had some evidence on the views of
stakeholders in high-income settings on the use of personal
data in research, next to nothing was known about the per-
spectives and expectations of research participants and
stakeholders in low- and middle-income country (LMIC)
settings. On behalf of the Forum partners, the Wellcome
Trust commissioned the research reported in this special
edition to target this critical evidence gap--linking the
expertise of the Ethox team at the University of Oxford with
research studies in Kenya, India, South Africa, Thailand,
and Vietnam. A key objective of the project from the outset
was to produce a toolkit that would enable the methodolo-
gies and resources developed through the project to be
applied and built upon in other settings.
The findings reported in the articles published here cast
valuable new light on the views of LMIC stakeholders on
the opportunities and challenges associated with data shar-
ing, revealing not only some common themes between the
five study sites but also some important differences. To mark
the culmination of the project, the Forum partners held a
workshop in Cape Town, South Africa on March 29 to 31,
2015, to discuss the preliminary findings of this work with
key African research stakeholders, and consider the key
opportunities and challenges for advancing data sharing in
an African context.
Discussions in Cape Town emphasized the need for data
sharing to be underpinned by fair and equitable terms,
which ensure benefits are delivered to local communities
and that local capacity to analyze and use data is enhanced.
There is a strong preference from LMIC researchers for
data to be shared (at least in the first instance) in a context
of established and trusted collaborations and networks:
Concerns are amplified significantly when stakeholders are
asked to consider sharing data to users with whom these
links do not exist.
Second, protecting the privacy and confidentiality of
research participants is clearly of paramount concern. A key
challenge in establishing effective governance frameworks
is balancing the need to ensure that data can be shared for
beneficial purposes with the need to create proportionate
safeguards to guard against these risks. A related challenge
is the need to understand and develop the governance mech-
anisms that are necessary to underpin and legitimize broad
consent models that allow for data to be used for beneficial
research purposes that may currently be unforeseen.
Finally, there was a clear consensus that the importance
of building trust and trustworthiness in frameworks estab-
lished to enable data sharing cannot be over-emphasized.
There is a need to actively engage key stakeholders in an
ongoing dialogue around the benefits and risks, and to
establish transparent and accountable data governance
processes.
The outcomes of this project will play a major role in
helping to shape the future priorities of the Public Health
Research Data Forum. Moving forward, it is likely that the
focus of the Forum will transition from commissioning
research toward the development of resources, training
materials, and technical support for researchers and institu-
tions that aid them in establishing the infrastructures and
policy frameworks needed to enable data sharing in differ-
ent settings. The toolkit created through this research is the
first major resource of this type.
We hope that this research will also make a broader
contribution to discussions on the interplay of funder
policies with appropriate local and national polices, and
specifically how implementation of funder policies can
be adapted locally to take account of contextual differ-
ences. It is also absolutely clear that the issues around
316 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 10(3)
data sharing are inextricably linked with broader issues
in global health research--such as capacity building and
benefit sharing--and a holistic perspective is required.
Building on the discussions at Cape Town, the Forum
partners are committed to facilitating an inclusive and
wide ranging discussion on these issues--with the ulti-
mate goal of ensuring that the benefits of data sharing are
realized at both a global and a local level.
