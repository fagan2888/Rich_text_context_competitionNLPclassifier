Roots of Psychology in India
Psychology as an organized science was studied in ancient
India under the purview of human medicine, which has
extensive roots right from Vedic times. But understanding,
classifications, methodologies, characterization, typology,
and so on of human behavior--incorporating body, mind,
and soul--has been a corner stone of the Indian medical
system, which has a significant segment on psychological
aspects of human behavior, although it is not detailed under
the name of "Psychology." The coining of the term is a rela-
tively recent phenomenon compared with the medical tradi-
tion. Although psychology per se was not studied, some of
the essential thoughts that burned at stalwarts of Indian intel-
lectual traditions were the following: "Who is the person?"
"How does he think?" "What is thinking?" "What is seeing?"
"What is the mind?" and "What is it made up of?" These and
many more questions that delve into a person's psyche were
of utmost importance to our seers and sages. These have led
to immense bodies of knowledge--spiritual, technical, prac-
tical, and empirical--which are yet to be explored and dis-
seminated even to this day. "Indian psychology is a complex
subject variously viewed as esoteric and spiritual, philo-
sophical and speculative, practical and ritualistic, and of
course, as we believe, systematic and scientific understand-
ing of human nature. There is truth in all these characteriza-
tions" (Rao, Paranjpe, & Dalal, 2008, p. xvii). Indian
psychology can also mean the psychology practiced by
psychologists in India but is not restricted to this, although
this is what most people think it is. Although the psychology
studied in Indian colleges and universities is western in
nature, there are now some universities that offer a basic
course on Indian psychology.
Indian psychology refers partly to aspects of psychology
that are directed to understanding the
behavioural perspectives and psychologically relevant
existential problems of Indians. Again, this is only
partially relevant. . . . Indian psychology is an indige-
nous psychology in that it is a psychology derived
from indigenous thought systems and therefore is
clearly best suited to address India specific psycho-
logical issues and problems. It is, however, more than
indigenous psychology for the reason that it offers
fruitful psychological models and theories, though
derived from classical Indian thought, that hold pan
human interest. (Rao et al., 2008, p. 2, 3)
The rich phenomenology of consciousness contained
in classical Indian thought, Hindu as well as Buddhist,
is useful in a variety of ways and is immensely helpful
in promoting cognitive science and for psycho-
diagnostic purposes. The epistemological dualism
implied in Indian psychology has profound implica-
tions for learning. . . . It also fills the current value
vacuum in education. Indian psychology has thus

Development and Standardization
of Mysore Triguna Scale
Shilpa S.1 and C. G.Venkatesha Murthy1
Abstract
The authors have developed a personality tool to assess Trigunas, that is, Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas.The Trigunas are composed
of the Pancha Mahabhutas, but one or the other guna is dominant singularly or in combination.There can never be a state
when one or the other Pancha Mahabhutas, and consequently the Trigunas, is absent totally. One or the other guna is in
dominance and is responsible for the behavior expressed by an individual.The present authors have tried to validate the same
in psychology, taking into account the descriptions as delineated in Indian tradition and classical textual scriptures. In this
process, the psychometric properties of the scale are established.

theories, technologies and techniques for personal
growth and well being as well as for enhancing the
human potential. All these and more open up new
frontiers for serious psychological study and research
anchored in Indian conceptual system. (Rao et al.,
2008, p. 8)
Study of Personality in India
Personality has always captured the attention of psycholo-
gists in the past. This tradition has influenced Indian psy-
chology too. Personality is studied and understood with
reference to two systems in Indian traditions. One is the
biological system and the other is the psychological system.
The biological system is set forth and understood by the
medical texts and scriptures like Ayurveda, which have very
specific ways of understanding health and ill-health and how
it is to be treated. These texts are very descriptive and exhaus-
tive, where Ayurveda is considered to be a part of the Atharva
Veda. These rely heavily on the Pancha Mahabhutas, their
combinations yielding to the biological humors of Tridoshas--
Vata, Pitta, and Kapha (VPK)--and their psychological
correlates of Trigunas--Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas (SRT)--to
explain the body, the mind, their constituents, and the cor-
responding behavior patterns including the spiritual aspect
involved.
While Charaka and Susruta have enumerated the different
psychological typologies that people can be classified under
in addition to an exhaustive description of the Tridoshas,
their balanced states and consequences of the imbalances,
they have not gone into minute details with regard to the
Trigunas as they have done with Tridoshas. It is to be noted
here that the Tridoshas, or the physiological humors and the
Trigunas, are fundamental constituents of Prakriti as enunci-
ated in the Samkhya-Yoga system of philosophy. Both are
composed of the Pancha Mahabhutas, but their action and
influence are on different systems that operate on man--the
physical-physiological (Tridoshas) and the psychological
(Trigunas). Each has their own unique actions, methodology
of behavior, and categorization, and one cannot replace the
other, although all six of them act in tandem and one cannot
exist without the other. All six of them are present in all
beings at all times, only the combinations and dominations
are different (Murthy, K.R.S., 2007a, 2007b; Sharma, P.,
1981, 2004).
The ayurvedic concepts of Tridosha and Triguna are well
delineated and appear to be a consolidation of the concepts
that have been borrowed from the other schools of thought or
rather Darsanas. Even so, there is no coherent consolidation
of the different aspects of personality from the various sources
of Indian philosophical systems. Admittedly, the Indian liter-
ary corpus is a vast ocean--of systems, philosophies, schools
of thought, literary influences, artistic influences, and what
not. But the commonality in each of them remains to be
found. The characteristics of man, or the Lakshanas of great
men as Varaha Mihira puts it in his Brhat Samhita, which is
an extension of his Brhat Jataka, is one such example. In the
same way, each of the different scriptural sources of India, be
it the Vedas, the Upanisads, the Bhagavad Gita, the
Mahabharata, the Nirukta, the Puranas, the Samkhya, and
the Yoga to name a few, has interpretations of the different
characteristics of how people are to be assessed and under-
stood to be of different kinds. Psychology as a field of human
understanding, which is the main focus of psychology, would
be enriched as a consequence of studying the nature or
psyche of man through this elemental method of scientific
and ancient tradition, which is a treasure trove of psychologi-
cal concepts waiting to be tapped.
Background Information
About the Study
This article consists of the standardization procedure that
was undertaken by the authors while developing a scale to
assess personality of people based on Trigunas. This forms
only part of the work that was undertaken by the first author
as a part of the thesis submitted for award of a doctoral
degree, while the second author is the guide and mentor for
this doctoral work.
The thesis consisted of developing and standardizing a set
of scales to assess personality of people from the Indian
psychological perspective, namely, Tridoshas (physical-
physiological component) and Trigunas (psycho-spiritual
component). The scale that was developed to assess the
Tridoshas has also been standardized; the same has been
accepted for publication in a reputed international peer-
reviewed journal. This article comprises the standardization
procedure that was followed for the scale based on the
Trigunas. Both these scales, one based on the Tridoshas and
the other based on the Trigunas, are stand-alone scales that
can be used alone (to assess the Tridoshas or Trigunas in a
person) or in conjunction with each other to arrive at a com-
plete and holistic understanding of personality from the
Indian concepts. What is presented here is the first-level anal-
ysis that is conducted to assess the dominant guna combina-
tion of a person. The raw scores of the person is calculated
(simple addition) and converted to Stanine scores. The salient
characteristics of each of the gunas are also delineated.
The third scale is also a Triguna scale, but it is not a stand-
alone scale and is an adjunct to the main Triguna scale (the
present article and scale is the main one). It is not necessary
for the first-level analysis but is an integral part of the second-
and third-level analyses.
There are 189 traits (common for the physical and psy-
chological aspect; hence, there are 189 physical or VPK
traits and 189 psychological or SRT traits) that have been
identified, which comprise the gamut of human behavior.
These are 100 Sattva traits, 60 Rajas traits, and 29 Tamas
traits. Based on answers that are obtained in the question-
naires, these 189 traits can be measured. (The answers are
Datar and Murthy 3
rearranged in a predetermined combination that yields the
189 VPK and SRT traits.) The raw scores for each of the
189 VPK and 189 SRT traits are calculated and converted
to Stanine scores. The interpretations for the Stanine scores
are also delineated. This comprises the second-level
analysis.
The same 189 VPK and 189 SRT trait raw scores are
added to give one consolidated score. Then, these 189 traits
are again combined in a set logic, wherein each trait is a
characteristic behavior exhibited by one (or more) of the 16
classical personality types (16 CPT) as delineated in classi-
cal and ayurvedic texts. So these 189 traits are all character-
istics of these principal 16 CPT (these personalities too
can be combined to give various combinations, to under-
stand and classify people). This comprises the third level of
analysis.
Although every individual answers three scales, the
answers undergo three different levels of analyses. After
these analyses, first, the unique and specific Tridosha and
Triguna combination of the person is tabulated and salient
characteristics mentioned. Next, his or her scores and inter-
pretations for the 189 traits (physical as well as psychologi-
cal) are delineated. Next, he or she is compared with the 16
CPT--Raw scores as well as Stanines, after they are tabu-
lated. In addition, the percentage of each of the 16 CPT is
also calculated. This calculation happens in three different
aspects of Sattva types, Rajas types, and Tamas types of per-
sonality and their relative dominance in each individual.
This details the dominance of each category of personality in
the individual and can be compared with the first-level analy-
sis for a further reinforcement of combinations of Trigunas in
people.BecausetheVPKaswellasSRTanswersareencrypted
in the 16 CPT analysis, there is no question of faking, social
desirability index, and so on, which are commonly thought to
have effects on answers, as all raw scores are also converted
to Stanine and each and every answer the individual gives is
also rated by himself or herself.
In this background, the present article is the standard-
ization procedure followed for the Triguna scale. Although
some of the Tamo guna items would incur social desirabil-
ity answers, thereby leading people to answer in ideal sce-
narios, the authors noticed that it did not really have much
of an impact. This is because, based on the answers the
person gave, and the different levels of analyses that were
conducted, both analyses at the first level and the third
level matched. Also, a statistical intercorrelation of VPK
and SRT was also undertaken based on the answers
obtained. The intercorrelations were found to follow the
same pattern as delineated in ayurvedic texts (with some
minor changes). This too has been submitted as an article
to another international journal, and has been accepted for
publication.
The mandate of one of the authors (whose doctoral work
this comprised) was to study the personality patterns of peo-
ple from three different professions, namely, teachers, IT
professionals, and police personnel. This was required so
that a personality profile of these three professions could be
developed and compared. Hence, the different inclusion/
exclusion criteria were exercised so as to enable them to take
only those respondents who fitted these conditions, so as to
develop a personality profile of people working in these dif-
ferent professions.
Development of the Mysore
Triguna Scale
In this article, an attempt is made to describe the test
construction and the standardization procedures and
results that were obtained for the development of the
scale based on Trigunas, their permutation and combina-
tion, and relative domination in personality assessment.
This scale will hereafter be referred to as the Mysore
Triguna scale.
Information about the Pancha Mahabhutas and Trigunas
was collected from various sources of Indian philosophy,
ancient texts, and all other material related to psychology
from an Indian perspective. These texts and scriptures
include the Vedas, Upanishads, Mimamsa Sutras, Samkhya,
Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, Yoga Vasistha of Valmiki, 17 Maha
Puranas (the researcher was unable to find one Maha
Purana, which was out of print), 5 Upa-Puranas, Srimad
Ramayana of Valmiki, Mahabharata, Shrimad Bhagavad
Gita, Dharmashastras, Ayurveda, Encyclopedia of Indian
Medicines, Nighantu and Nirukta, Bhaktirasamrta Bindu of
Rupa Goswamin, Natya Sastra of Bharata, Iswara Samhita,
Manu Smriti, Brhad Devata, Elements of Hindu Iconography,
to name a few.
In the Indian psychological literature, Guna theory is
already empirically tested and accepted (Murthy, P.K., &
Kumar, 2007). Each guna gives certain characteristic quali-
ties to the person based on which an individual can be classi-
fied as belonging to that particular guna type. Charaka and
Susruta recognize seven types or categories into which peo-
ple can be classified, depending on the dominance of the
gunas in their body. They are said to belong to a particular
guna combination, as follows:
1. people with dominant Sattva Guna
2. people with dominant Rajas Guna
3. people with dominant Tamas Guna
4. people with dominant Sattva-Rajas Guna combination
5. people with dominant Sattva-Tamas Guna combi-
nation
6. people with dominant Rajas-Tamas Guna combi-
nation
7. people with balanced gunas or with Sattva-Rajas-
Tamas Guna combination.
On observing the aforementioned classification that can
be used for categorizing people, we can confidently say that
4 SAGE Open
there can never be a state when either one or two of the gunas
are absent in any person at any point of time whatsoever.
Hence, all people are only combinations of these three gunas
in varying combinations and permutations. Depending on the
circumstances, the dominance of the gunas are changing, but
in relatively small quantities that give rise to our expressions
of anger, fear, anxiety, sadness, joy, and so on. If there were
no movement of the gunas, then the expression of different
emotions would not be there in our behavior too. No person is
always happy, always sad, or always depressed and so on.
Hence, the study of the gunas, their movement in people, and
how they affect our daily life and behavior make for fascinat-
ing study. Thus, the relative dominance and relevance of the
gunas in people can be studied and classified accordingly
to ensure a better understanding of human behavior. This
article is just the beginning of this journey.
Review of Literature
There have been various attempts by researchers to develop
tools from these three models, Pancha Kosas, Tridoshas, and
Trigunas, to study and assess personality from the Indian
perspective. The different studies and tools that have been
taken up and developed from these three domains have been
mentioned here.
The Trigunas and their manifestation, and their effect
on the human mind and consequently on human behavior,
are subjects that have attracted the attention of psycholo-
gists across the world, with researchers not only from
India but from other countries too having studied it.
Consequently, there are many tools that have been devel-
oped to study the play of the Trigunas on the human per-
sonality (Krishnamurthy, Lakshmi, & Parameswaran, 1971;
Marutham, Balodhi, & Mishra,1998; Mathew, 1995; Mohan,
& Sandhu, 1986; Pathak, Bhatt, & Sharma, 1992; Wolf,
1998, 1999), gunas as predictors of workplace ethics (Bhal
& Debnath, 2004, 2006), and the Vedanta concept of per-
sonality development (Modh, personal communication,
27 September, 2008).
A projective-inventory method for personality assessment
(Puhan, 1995) has also been attempted from the Indian perspec-
tive.ThewellknownandreveredIndianepic,theMahabharata,
has also been studied for its contribution to the understanding of
human behavior and dynamics based on which there has been
a tool developed (Singh, R., 1971), while the Bhagavad Gita,
which is universally acknowledged as a classical text in under-
standing human personality and psychology by one and all, has
also been the basis for a good number of tools to be developed
to study personality (Das, R.C., 1991; Laxmibai, Murthy, &
Nagalakshmi, 1975; Dillbeck, 1983, 1990).
Infant temperament from an Indian perspective has been
studied by Kapur, Hirisave, Reddy, Barnabas, and Singhal
(1997), using a previous tool developed by Marutham et al.
(1998) for the assessment; a shorter version of the tool devel-
oped by Pathak, Bhatt, and Sharma (1992) was developed to
study self-concept and job satisfaction vis-à-vis the three
gunas (Sharma, R., 1999). The IAS Rating scale developed
by Matthew (1995) was used to study the three gunas, psi
experience, and personality dimensions (Sebastian &
Mathew, 2002), and the tool developed by Pathak et al. (1992)
was used in another study that delved into the Trigunas and
how they associated with psychological problems (Das &
Venugopal, 2008).
The role of the three gunas among anxiety disorders
(Velayudhan, Balodhi, & Mishra, 1998) and among patients
with depression (Kumar, 2006) has also been looked into
briefly. In the same vein, the effect of chanting the Hare
Krishna Maha Mantra to increase Sattva and decrease Rajas
and Tamas (Wolf, 2000; Wolf & Abell, 2003); the effects of
Yoga, pranayama, and thermal biofeedback techniques in the
management of stress and high blood pressure (Latha &
Kaliappan, 1991); and Yogic techniques that would promote
mental health and alleviate mental and emotional distress
(Kapur, R.L., 1994) were also explored. A randomized con-
trol trial of the effect of yoga on gunas (personality) and
health in normal healthy volunteers of both sexes has been
conducted (Deshpande, Nagendra, & Raghuram, 2008), and
conclusions drawn.
Mysore Triguna Scale Construction
The constructs to assess the gunas in a person were identi-
fied based on previous tools and from the vast amount of
literature available in the Indian tradition, like the Vedas,
Upanishads, the Mahabharata--including the Bhagavad
Gita that forms a part of it, Samkhya, Yoga, Puranas, and
Ayurveda to name a few.
The scale underwent several revisions. Each one was cor-
rected for grammatical errors, ambiguity, syntactic errors, and
so on. The scale was thus finalized for the final pilot study.
This scale was later modified, by putting all constructs assess-
ing similar traits into a cluster. The markings indicating the
statements to be Sattva, Rajas, or Tamas were removed. In
each construct itself, the three statements were jumbled up so
that there was no definite order of appearance of the three
types of statements in all the construct-wise questions. The
scale comprised 63 statements each to identify SRT. The total
number was thus 189.
Sampling Framework
The researchers intended to study three different sets of
adults of occupational groups covering teachers, IT pro-
fessionals, and the police personnel of Bangalore city.
Along with this, another group of people from different
professions other than the three already mentioned was
also selected.
To this end, many different colleges, IT companies,
and the police department were approached for their
cooperation. Adults from the above groups were drawn
Datar and Murthy 5
randomly, based on a set of criteria indicating job satis-
faction, absence of any psychiatric problems, and a mini-
mum of 5 years of continuous practice in their chosen
vocation.
As can be seen in Table 1, there were a total of 358 teach-
ers, 414 police, 346 IT professionals, and 430 people from
the general adult category, thus making the total number of
respondents for the study 1,548. The Mysore Triguna scale
was thus standardized on this sample, and results and infer-
ences drawn therein.
Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion
The criteria followed for the inclusion of people's data
into the final study and standardization of the scale were
as follows.
1. Only those people who had job satisfaction were
included in the final analysis. To assess job satis-
faction, the Job Satisfaction Scale (Singh, A., &
Sharma, 1999) was employed.
2. Only those who had no problems with mental
health as assessed by the Modified MINI (Sheehan
et al., 1998) were included.
3. Only those who had no problems with drinking
behavior as assessed by the Alcohol Use Dis-
orders Identification Test (AUDIT; Babor, Higgins-
Biddle, Saunders, & Monteiro, 2001) were
included.
4. Only nonsmokers as determined from the Fag-
erstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND;
Heatherton, Kozlowski, Frecker, & Fagerstrom,
1991) were taken into consideration and included.
5. Only those people practicing in the profession for a
minimum of 5 years consecutively were included.
Only those people who satisfied all the aforementioned
criteria were included in the study. There were 2,142
respondents for initial screening, and finally 1,548 were
selected after satisfying various inclusion criteria.Although
some of the Tamo guna items would incur social desirabil-
ity answers, thereby leading people to answer in ideal
scenarios, the authors noticed that it did not really have
much of an impact.
The researchers wanted to study the domination of gunas
in people belonging to different professions like teachers, IT
professionals, and police personnel. Hence, all the aforemen-
tioned criteria were used for inclusion and those who did not
qualify were excluded from the study. This was to ensure
that as "pure" a sample as possible of individuals who clas-
sically fit into the profession was obtained for comparison
with people from other professions.
An example of the kind of items included in the Triguna
scale:
Description of my speech:
A When I talk to other people, I get agitated easily but control
myself. Min. Avg. Strong.
B 
When I talk to other people, I am calm, peaceful and
tolerant.Min. Avg. Strong
C I don't think before I talk. Min. Avg. Strong
The respondents were asked to tick the statement (1, 2,
or all 3 if it is true of the respondents) that is most appli-
cable to them, and also mark the degree to which it is
present in them, making the respondents rate their own
behavior in different situations. No triplet of answers
could be ignored. Because software was developed for the
purpose of assessment of personality, this could be
controlled.
Establishing the Psychometric
Properties of the Scale
Reliability, validity, and norms for the Mysore Triguna scale
were developed as follows:
Reliability
The researchers have attempted to establish different pos-
sible types of reliability.
Cronbach's alpha reliability. The reliability statistics that
were observed on administering the scale to the sample of
1,548 people for the standardization of the scale are shown in
Table 2.

6 SAGE Open
SRT scale is a self-rating scale, which has 189 items, with
63 items each for assessing SRT in a respondent. The
Cronbach's alpha for the scale was .969 for Sattva, .911 for
Rajas, and .876 for Tamas. Thus, the reliability coefficient is
very high.
Split-half reliability. Split-half reliability of the scale was
also found. The scale was divided into two parts, wherein
Part 1 had 95 items and Part 2 had 94 items.
The mean for Part 1 was found to be 59.71 and that of
Part 2 was found to be 57.44, as shown in Table 3. The alpha
value for Part 1 was found to be .93 and that of Part 2 was
.92. The correlation between forms was found to be .96. The
Spearman-Brown coefficient was applied; the value for
equal length was found to be .98 and that of unequal length
was found to be .98. The Guttman split-half coefficient was
also computed and it was found to be .98. Thus, the high
level of correlation indicates that the scale is highly reliable
(Table 4).
Test­retest reliability. Test­retest reliability of the scale was
established by administering the test to a group of 60 people
with a gap of about 20 days from the first administration.
The Pearson correlation for Sattva items was found to be
.83, for Rajas items .866, and for Tamas items .734, all being
positive and significant at the .01 level, as can be seen in Table 5.
Thus, it can be concluded that this scale is a reliable one.
Validity
Two kinds of validity were established, as follows:
Content validity. Content validity was established by sub-
jecting the items of the scale to the scrutiny of ayurvedic,
philosophy, and Sanskrit specialists, and their concordance
was obtained. Wherever possible, their suggestions to
enhance the items were incorporated, and the items were
rephrased so as to elicit better responses.
The items were developed for the Triguna scale and
shown to experts and other scholars in the field of
Sanskrit and philosophy along with Ayurveda, to get
their ratings, which were the bases for developing the
scale other than referring to other tools that assess gunas
in a person.
Table 6 indicates that 100% of the ayurvedic experts have
agreed that these items are measuring SRT. Thus, the items
have very high content validity.
The items of the Mysore Triguna scale were shown to
experts in the field of Sanskrit and philosophy, and their rat-
ings are indicated in Table 7.
The items of the Mysore Triguna scale were shown to
Sanskrit scholars and philosophers to get their approval, as
this was a multidisciplinary work involving knowledge derived
from the fields of Ayurveda, Sanskrit, and philosophy--from
the psychological perspective of understanding human
behavior and its dynamics. There was concordance from all
the specialists about the items as all of them have agreed that
the items are acceptable.
Apart from getting the ratings on the items by the above
specialists, the ratings of psychologists were also sought to
validate it from the domain of psychology. The ratings
received from psychologists are indicated in Table 8.
An analysis of Table 8 indicates that 90% of the psycholo-
gists have agreed that the items developed for assessing
Triguna do really assess Triguna. Hence, the scale has a high
measure of content validity.
Concurrent validity. Concurrent validity of the scale was
also established by comparing the responses of the same
respondents on the Mysore Triguna scale and those on the
Renu Sharma's SRT Scale, which assesses SRT in an indi-
vidual. Renu Sharma's tool was administered to 60 people
apart from the present tool. Thus, all the 60 respondents took
both the tests. The obtained results were subjected to correla-
tion, which yielded the following.
An analysis of the Table 9 indicates that the correlation
coefficient was found to be .776 for Sattva, .835 for Rajas,
and .427 for Tamas, and the coefficients were found to be
statistically significant at the .01 level. This means that,
because the correlation between the two scales is high and
statistically significant, the validity of the Mysore Triguna
scale developed by the researchers is highly valid. This indi-
cates that the present scale is a valid one.
The salient characteristics of SRT were identified and can
be seen in Table 10.

Norms
As the ultimate purpose of standardization of a test is to
establish norms, the present researchers have developed Stanine
scores. The distribution of the SRT total scores were converted
to Stanine Scores (Ferguson, 1981) as shown in Table 11.
The scores on SRT range from 0 to 189. The total scores
range from 0 to 567. These score ranges can be converted into
Stanine scores using Table 11. Thus, an individual can be
assessed on SRT based on their responses. Stanines 1 to 3 indi-
cates a lower presence of the guna, 4 to 6 indicates average, and
7 to 9 indicates a higher presence of the guna. Thus, individuals
can be identified and categorized on different levels of guna.
An analysis of Table 12 indicates that the distribution of
scores are closer to a normal probability curve, as all the
measures of central tendency are very close to each other.
Thus, it suggests that these gunas are distributed normally in
any population. Furthermore, one can also infer that the pres-
ent sample also represents the population adequately well.
Conclusion
The authors have been able to develop a scale to assess
SRT--the concepts taken from the Indian intellectual tradi-
tion and Ayurveda--and validated it from the domain of
psychology using psychometric procedures. The developed

Stanine scores interpretation:
Stanine scores 1-3 = Low degree of presence of the traits (guna).
Stanine scores 4-6 = Moderate degree of presence of the traits (guna).
Stanine scores 7-9 = High degree of presence of the traits (guna).
