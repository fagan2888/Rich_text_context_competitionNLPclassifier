Introduction
Mixed-methods research (MMR) continues to grow in popu-
larity as a methodology in educational, social, and health sci-
ence research (Curry and Nunez-Smith, 2015; Plano Clark,
2010; Tashakkori and Teddlie, 2010). MMR is defined as an
approach to research in which both quantitative and qualita-
tive data are collected, analyzed, and integrated, thereby
drawing interpretations based on the combined strengths of
both sets of data (Creswell, 2015a; Creswell and Plano Clark,
2011). Since the 1980s, researchers have increasingly used
MMR approaches in natural, social, and health science
research (Maxwell, 2016; Stange et al., 1994; Stange and
Zyzanski, 1989). Since that time, a growing number of
empirical studies have been published, and there is consider-
ably more agreement about the nomenclature for core designs
than even a decade ago (Fetters, 2016).
Integration is considered by many to be the hallmark of
MMR (Fetters et al., 2013; Fetters and Freshwater, 2015;
O'Cathain et al., 2007). Integration is defined as an intentional
process by which the researcher brings quantitative and quali-
tative data together in one study (Creswell, 2015a). By inten-
tionally integrating data, the researcher can access knowledge
or insights unavailable to a quantitative or qualitative study
undertaken independently (Fetters and Freshwater, 2015;
O'Cathain et al., 2007). Researchers can achieve MMR inte-
gration through the philosophical, research design, methods
and data collection, and/or during the interpretation and report-
ing levels of the research.
Conceptual models to guide integration
during analysis in convergent mixed
methods studies
Ellen Moseholm1 and Michael D Fetters2
Abstract
Methodologists have offered general strategies for integration in mixed-methods studies through merging of quantitative and
qualitative data. While these strategies provide researchers in the field general guidance on how to integrate data during
mixed-methods analysis, a methodological typology detailing specific analytic frameworks has been lacking. The purpose of this
article is to introduce a typology of analytical approaches for mixed-methods data integration in mixed-methods convergent
studies. We distinguish three dimensions of data merging analytics: (1) the relational dimension, (2) the methodological
dimension, and (3) the directional dimension. Five different frameworks for data merging relative to the methodological
and directional dimension in convergent mixed-methods studies are described: (1) the explanatory unidirectional approach,
(2) the exploratory unidirectional approach, (3) the simultaneous bidirectional approach, (4) the explanatory bidirectional
approach, and (5) the exploratory bidirectional approach. Examples from empirical studies are used to illustrate each type.
Researchers can use this typology to inform and articulate their analytical approach during the design, implementation, and
reporting phases to convey clearly how an integrated approach to data merging occurred.

2 Methodological Innovations
The objectives of this article are three-fold. First, we
describe integration at the different levels and the integration
challenges specifically associated with merging quantitative
and qualitative data in the analysis in convergent mixed-meth-
ods studies. Second, we define three dimensions of merging
analytics at the relational, methodological, and directional lev-
els, and describe the subcategories of each. Third, we intro-
duce a typology including novel nomenclature for
mixed-methods analysis procedures relative to the methodo-
logical and directional level in convergent MMR studies. We
introduce a lens heuristic that can be used to illustrate the
directional levels, unidirectional and bidirectional, to illustrate
variationsinthetypologyforinformingintegrationapproaches.
Through these conceptual representations and examples,
mixed-methods researchers can understand different
approaches in merging of quantitative and qualitative data to
enhance interpretation of merged data in convergent studies.
Integration in mixed-methods research
Integration at the philosophical level
The utility of paradigms for MMR has been debated exten-
sively by previous methodologists (Morgan, 2007; Plano
Clark and Ivankova, 2016; Shannon-Baker, 2015). For pur-
poses of this article, we use Morgan's (2007) definition of
paradigm as "systems of shared beliefs among a community
of scholars" that influence how researchers select both the
questions they study and the methods that they use to study
them (p. 65). The terms "quantitative" and "qualitative" are
not synonymous with paradigms, but refer to different
approaches to data and methods in social science (Biesta,
2010; Morgan, 2007; Shannon-Baker, 2015)
Mixing of epistemological positions. Some methodologists have
questioned whether the different epistemological positions
that quantitative and qualitative studies employ can be logi-
cally mixed and integrated (Biesta, 2010; Plano Clark and
Ivankova, 2016). Some could argue that MMR is unattainable
because it is not possible to mix methods that are based on
incompatible views of the social world (Plano Clark and
Ivankova, 2016; Sale et al., 2002). Others have argued that
multiple, even conflicting paradigms should be used in MMR
research. For example, Johnson argues for dialectical plural-
ism as a "metaparadigm" for integrating equally and respect-
fully the quantitative and qualitative paradigms such that
researchers can thrive on their differences and intellectual
tensions while still developing integrated wholes (Johnson,
2015). Another prominent stance is that there are single para-
digms that can provide a good foundation for MMR. Mertens
(2003) argues for a transformative-emancipation paradigm
characterized by the intentional collaboration with minority
and marginalized groups, while others discuss critical realism
as philosophical basis for MMR (Maxwell and Mittapalli,
2010). A detailed review of these arguments exceeds the
scope of this article, but a good overview of different para-
digms in MMR is provided by Shannon-Baker (2015).
Despite some strongly argued views of the incompatibility of
quantitative and qualitative approaches, a robust series of pro-
posals for integration at the philosophical level have been
articulated and have become increasingly accepted.
An analysis grounded in pragmatism.In this article, we take
pragmatism as our paradigmatic stance (Morgan, 2007,
2014). The rationale for a pragmatic approach in MMR
research lies in its response to the traditional ontological and
epistemological positions that proclaim issues of incompati-
ble paradigms when conducting MMR research (Biesta,
2010). Pragmatism does not reject the differences between,
for example, positivism and constructivism as approaches to
research, but focuses on their characteristic approaches to
inquiry (Morgan, 2014). Pragmatism emphasizes creating
shared meaning and joint action, and this emphasis points to
the underlying belief in complementarity. Hence, quantita-
tive and qualitative approaches can be combined in order to
complement the advantages and disadvantages within each
approach (Shannon-Baker, 2015).
Integration at the design level
Integration at the design level can occur through core (also
known as basic) designs that include explanatory sequential,
exploratory sequential, and convergent designs (Creswell,
2015a; Fetters et al., 2013).An explanatory sequential design
begins with collecting and analyzing quantitative data, and
these findings then inform the follow-up qualitative phase.
The exploratory sequential design begins with collecting and
analyzing qualitative data that then builds to the subsequent
quantitative phase (Fetters et al., 2013). In a convergent
design, the quantitative and qualitative data are collected and
analyzed during a similar timeframe and the data compared
(Fetters et al., 2013). In addition to these core designs, there
are additional advanced designs or so-called "complex"
designs (Nastasi and Hitchcock, 2016), multistage applica-
tions, intervention, case study, participatory, and instrument/
app development build upon the three core designs, but have
an overarching purpose, for example, interventional MMR
design used in trials, or transformative design used to pro-
mote social justice (Creswell, 2015a; Fetters et al., 2013).
Integration at the methods level
The scope of general procedures for linking quantitative and
qualitative data at the methods level has been classified as
connecting (linking through sampling), building (findings
from one strand inform development of data collection tools
or procedures for the other strand), hypothesis generating and
testing (using one type of data to generate hypothesis and
another type of data to test that hypothesis), matching (reflect-
ing the intent to have themes/constructs match on a domain
Moseholm and Fetters 3
by domain basis), diffracting (using cuts of data to understand
a phenomenon), embedding (the addition of qualitative data
into a multistage study at multiple points), and merging (the
two databases are brought together for analysis and for com-
parison) (Fetters et al., 2013; Uprichard and Dawney, 2016).
Five of these approaches occur during data collection, while
merging remains the most obtuse as it refers to the analytical
process, and diffraction may refer to multiple levels.
Integration at the interpretation and reporting
level
Integration at the interpretation and reporting level can be
either through narrative, data transformation, joint displays,
and visualization, for example, using Geographic Information
System (GIS) mapping (Fielding and Cisneros-Puebla, 2009;
Jones, 2015), or a combination there of (Fetters et al., 2013).
For example, Beck et al. (2009) describe the quantitative and
qualitative findings in the discussion, thereby integrating
data through a narrative. Tarn et al. (2013) illustrate transfor-
mation of data in their intervention study where qualitative
data were transformed into quantitative data and then merged
with quantitative survey results in a combined analysis.
Panda et al. (2015) illustrate the use of joint display as a way
to bring data together through visual means in a convergent
study. Jones (2015) illustrates the use of visualization through
GIS mapping in seed distribution programming.
A more detailed view of merging data
in a convergent MMR study
Merging of quantitative and qualitative data during the anal-
ysis continues to be an active area of discussion and develop-
ment, but has proven to be difficult in practice (Bryman,
2006, 2007; Ostlund et al., 2011). Merging typically occurs
in the analysis phase in convergent MMR studies, and this
can be challenging due to the inherent difficulty of compar-
ing results from different forms of data. Current discussions
about merging remain general, and use descriptive non-
directive language such as "the data are brought together to
enhance greater understanding" (Creswell and Plano Clark,
2011; Curry and Nunez-Smith, 2015).
Approaches for integrating quantitative and qualitative data
have been addressed in the literature (Bazeley, 2012; Castro
et al., 2010; Onwuegbuzie et al., 2009; Plano Clark et al.,
2010). These authors suggest practical techniques relative to
integrating data generally during the methods, but explication
of a typology for approaches to merging quantitative and quali-
tative data during the actual analysis remains obtuse.
Articulating the intent of merging during design of
a convergent MMR study
During the design of a convergent mixed-methods study,
investigators may have various degrees of clarity of intent
relative to merging.The first pattern, a "blind faith" approach,
describes the situation when the researchers have an intent,
sometimes more vague than not, that merging the two types
of data will produce new insights about the phenomena of
their research. The second pattern, the "matching" approach,
involves intentionally designing data collection instruments
to have related items such that both instruments will eluci-
date data about the same phenomena/variables. Concretely,
this involves matching qualitative questions with scales of
quantitative instruments (Creswell, 2015a, 2015b; Fetters
et al., 2013). The third pattern, the "data diffraction"
approach, alludes to the design (and often inevitability) of
the quantitative and qualitative data collection instruments to
obtain different aspects of a central phenomenon. The intent
is to obtain different "cuts of data" that will reveal informa-
tion about different aspects of a phenomenon of interest
(Uprichard and Dawney, 2016).
Techniques for merging qualitative and
quantitative data
The existing literature does offer techniques for merging
quantitative and qualitative data for analysis (Bazeley, 2012;
Creswell, 2015a; Fetters et al., 2013). These can include (1)
comparing the quantitative and qualitative findings after sep-
arate analyses of the quantitative and qualitative data col-
lected (Fetters et al., 2013); (2) analyzing on a
construct-by-construct basis by linking related quantitative
scales and qualitative themes (Fetters et al., 2013); (3) follow-
ing a thread based on a finding during the analysis of one type
of data that leads to looking for related information in the
other type of data (O'Cathain et al., 2010); (4) analysis
through construction of joint display that juxtaposes quantita-
tive and qualitative findings side-by-side, and then draws
meta-inferences from both sources of data (Guetterman et al.,
2015); (5) data transformation of one type of data into the
other type of data (e.g. qualitative to quantitative data trans-
formation followed by merging of the transformed quantita-
tive data with the other collected quantitative data, or
quantitative to qualitative transformation followed by merg-
ing of the transformed qualitative data with the other col-
lected qualitative data) (Fetters et al., 2013); (6) data
correlation (as an iteration of qualitative to quantitative trans-
formation) involves the process of correlating or cross-classi-
fying the data types, for example, converting qualitative data
into "variables" and correlating with quantitative data through
point-biserial correlation and cross-tabulation tables (Johnson
and Christensen, 2014); (7) data consolidation when quantita-
tive and qualitative data are brought together to form new
consolidated codes, variables, or datasets (Johnson and
Christensen, 2014); and (8) use of GIS mapping to bring
together for analysis spatial information with local quantita-
tive or qualitative findings (Fielding and Cisneros-Puebla,
2009). These techniques focus on the practical approach to
merging, while paying little attention to the analytical frame.
4 Methodological Innovations
Outcomes of merging
The existing literature also presents outcomes of merging
data. An outcome of the comparisons of the two different
strands, that is, the quantitative and qualitative, on a topic is
the ability to see whether the databases converge, comple-
ment, conflict, or diverge (Creswell, 2015b). Note should
be made that the intention of data collection procedures
during the design phase, and the outcomes after the actual
data collection and analysis may not always be congruent.
That is, a researcher who matches data collection to similar
domains on both the quantitative and qualitative data col-
lection tools may well produce data that converge, comple-
ment, conflict, or diverge. Across all domains of the study,
there can be two or more of these outcomes for each domain
within the same study.
The mixed-methods methodology "field test"
For mixed-methods researchers, the "rubber hits the road"
when field work actually ensues, and it is during this time
when cracks, potholes, and omissions in current methodo-
logical thinking often become apparent. In working on the
integration of survey data and interview data in two differ-
ent convergent MMR studies--one investigating quality of
life in patients undergoing diagnostic evaluations for can-
cer (Moseholm et al., 2016), and another project on gate-
keeper training for suicide prevention in an ethnic minority
population (Teo et al., 2016)--we felt keenly that current
descriptions in the literature fell short for describing the
analytical framing and procedures we were using. Despite
the deceivingly simple notion that the data are "brought
together and compared," different possibilities for merging
surfaced. This prompted our exploration of a typology of
analytical frameworks for and examples of data merging
during integration. This approach focuses on merging at the
analytical level, thereby extending the practical techniques
previously described in the literature (Creswell, 2015a;
Fetters et al., 2013).
Three dimensions of data merging
analytics
We contend that there are three key dimensions of data merg-
ing analytics in an integrated MMR analysis, the relational,
the methodological, and directional. Below, we discuss these
three dimensions (Table 1).
Relational dimension of merging
The relational dimension of data merging can be defined as
how researchers conducting mixed-methods studies allow
the data collection and analytics of the quantitative and qual-
itative strands to interface. The relational dimension can be
characterized under two categories, either "separative" or
"iterative." In the separative approach, the quantitative and
qualitative data analyses are conducted independent of each
other until the final merging of the two strands. For example,
McAuley et al. (2006) utilized a separate approach where the
quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed
separately and then integrated through themes in the discus-
sion of the results. This may be especially common in large
teams where there is a qualitative analysis team, and a biosta-
tistics team. In the iterative approach, "the data talk to each
other" during the analysis and data collection. For example,
Crabtree et al. (2005) utilized an iterative approach in MMR
case studies research when qualitative findings were used
early on to develop and refine quantitative instruments.
Rather than allowing two products to emerge separately for
comparison, for example, the quantitative results and the
qualitative results, and then compared, the iterative approach
involves cross-talk during the data collection and analytics.
Methodological dimension of merging
The methodological dimension of data merging can be
defined as how the quantitative and qualitative strands are
weighted relative to merging analytics. There are three cate-
gories of the methodological dimension of data merging ana-
lytics. Johnson et al. (2007) describe MMR as being
"qualitatively driven," "quantitatively driven," and "equal-
status." They depict qualitatively driven MMR as QUAL +
quan to emphasize that the qualitative strand predominates,
and define it thus:
Qualitative dominant mixed methods research is the type of
mixedresearchinwhichonereliesonaqualitative,constructivist-
poststructuralist-critical view of the research process, while
concurrently recognizing that the addition of quantitative data
and approaches are likely to benefit most research projects.
(Johnson et al., 2007: 124)
They depict quantitatively driven MMR as QUAN + qual
to emphasize when the quantitative strand predominates, and
define it as follows:
Quantitative dominant mixed methods research is the type of
mixedresearchinwhichonereliesonaquantitative,postpositivist

view of the research process, while concurrently recognizing that
the addition of qualitative data and approaches are likely to
benefit most research projects. (Johnson et al., 2007: 124)
They do not define the "Equal Status" approach directly
in their original 2007 article (Johnson et al., 2007), but
Johnson (2015: 4) later elaborates on equal-status as "inter-
active mixed research" where the researcher or research team
attempts to listen to qualitative- and quantitative-related
epistemologies or insights to produce a superior whole. To
provide greater consistency and clarity, we propose the term
equivalently driven mixed-methods research.
Directional dimension of merging
The directional dimension of merging can be defined as
whether the merging analytics occur using a one-way "unidi-
rectional" approach, or whether the merging analytics occur
using a "two-way" bidirectional approach.
Unidirectional approaches.In the unidirectional approaches,
the lens of the completed analysis of one type of data frames
the merging of the two types of data. As the merging can go
from the quantitative strand to the qualitative strand or from
the qualitative strand to the quantitative strand, two unidirec-
tional approaches emerge (Figures 1 and 2).
Bidirectional approaches.In bidirectional approaches, the
hallmark is using the analytics of both the quantitative and
qualitative strands to frame merging. These frameworks
have a "two-way" lens such that the analyses of both types of
data can be considered in the framing. This can be achieved
simultaneously or iteratively. With the simultaneous
approach, the researcher uses results from the quantitative
and qualitative strands to look at each other and structure the
merged findings based on both (Figure 3). As the merging
can go from the quantitative strand to the qualitative strand
and back to the quantitative strand (Figure 4) or from the
qualitative strand to the quantitative strand and back to the
qualitative strand (Figure 5). Hence, there are three bidirec-
tional approaches.
Typology and nomenclature for mixed
methods analytic procedures when
merging data in convergent mixed-
methods research
For consistency with the existing and predominant language
of MMR, the terminology introduced in the typology lever-
ages language used for MMR study designs. This was a
deliberate choice as the typology logically extends concepts
that already exist in the MMR literature (Fetters and Molina-
Azorin, 2017).
Based on the above-presented dimensions of data merg-
ing, a typology can thus be developed for data merging
analytics (Table 2). As the relational element speaks to the
presence or lack of iterative merging during data collection
and analysis, and the proposed typology speaks to the data
merging analytics only, our typology incorporates elements
from the methodological and directional dimensions. The

design integration.

6 Methodological Innovations
proposed typology focuses on the methodological frame of
integration, for example, merging analytics, and is therefore
not linked to the other "levels" of integration, for example,
the philosophical, design, or methods.
Below we present the typology of the five different MMR
analytical approaches, both uni- and bidirectional, for fram-
ing the integration through merging of quantitative and qual-
itative data in a convergent design (Figures 1 to 5).
To demonstrate the five possible combinations of data
merging analytics beyond the conceptual level, there needs
to be empirical evidence for the five data merging analytical
procedures. Table 2 provides each framework and a relevant
study to illustrate how researchers have used the different
approaches in merging of quantitative and qualitative data in
actual convergent studies. These articles were found through
searches in Journal of Mixed Methods Research, Quality &
Quantity, Field Methods, and Google Scholar using the fol-
lowing search words: "convergent OR concurrent" AND
"mixed methods." The search focused on the ways in which
researchers framed the merging of quantitative and qualita-
tive data in their analysis. The methodological approach used
in the analysis was identified by the authors of this article
based on the methods, priority of quantitative and qualitative
strands, and/or presentation and discussion of the results.
Examples for each of the five merging analytical procedures
are provided below.
Nomenclature for unidirectional approaches
In both unidirectional approaches, the lens of the completed
analysis of one type of data frames the merging of the two
types of data. Thus, there is a sequential approach to the anal-
ysis. The literature provides language for sequential MMR
designs. This language can be readily extended to merging
analyses.
Explanatory unidirectional framework for data
merging analytics
When an initial quantitative strand is conducted and fol-
lowed by a qualitative study to explain the findings, the
design is called an explanatory mixed-methods design. When
the lens of the strand of the quantitative analytics frames the
merged analysis, it is called a unidirectional explanatory uni-
directional framework (Figure 1). Thus, at the analytical
level, a quantitatively structured analysis is complemented
by the qualitative data to provide a more comprehensive
understanding of the phenomena of interest.
Explanatory unidirectional framework examples.Two studies
illustrate the explanatory unidirectional approach. Maiorana
et al. (2012) illustrate this approach in their study about trust
and acceptability of sharing HIV-related patient data. Quan-
titative survey data with HIV patients and qualitative inter-
view data with medical staff were merged for comparison,
using the qualitative findings to provide a more in-depth
understanding of the quantitative drivers and barriers of shar-
ing HIV-related patient data (Maiorana et al., 2012). The
quantitative data framed the analysis and the qualitative data
were used to elaborate and explain the quantitative findings.
Kennett et al. (2008) used a convergent MMR design to
understand how learned resourcefulness empowers individu-
als with chronic pain. Using survey data to divide partici-
pants into categories of high and low resourcefulness, the
researchers used qualitative data to explain contrasting expe-
riences across categories. The quantitative categories framed
the merging of the two datasets and the qualitative data were
used to enhance understanding of the complexities underly-
ing the pain-coping process (Kennett et al., 2008).
Exploratory unidirectional framework for data
merging analytics
When an initial qualitative strand is used to explore a topic
that is then followed by a quantitative strand, the design is
called an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design. This

design integration.

design integration.
Moseholm and Fetters 7
language can be adapted to merging analytics. When the lens
of the strand of the qualitative analytics frames the merged
analysis, it is an exploratory unidirectional framework (Figure
2). Thus, at the analytical level a qualitatively structured anal-
ysis is complemented by the quantitative data to provide a
more thorough understanding of the phenomena of interest.
Exploratory unidirectional framework examples. Astudy explor-
ing how knowledge and cognitive function contribute to self-
care in patients with heart failure illustrates the exploratory
unidirectional approach (Dickson et al., 2011). Qualitative
interview data were used to create a frame for the next steps
in the analysis where the quantitative survey results were
used to enhance understanding by exploring misconceptions
and lack of understanding in those with inadequate self-care
(Dickson et al., 2011). Myers et al. (2012) conducted in-
depth qualitative interviews and quantitative web-based sur-
veys with medical providers in a study examining how HIV
patients' care teams perceived the usefulness and ease of
application of newly implemented health information
exchange systems. From the qualitative data, the researchers
discovered key differences in perceptions and actual use of
health information exchange systems across occupational
groups. The researchers then used these results to guide the
analysis of the quantitative survey data, stratifying by occu-
pational group. Merging of the two datasets was thus framed
by the qualitative data analysis, and the final results offer
insights into the use and potential benefits of health informa-
tion exchange systems (Myers et al., 2012).
Nomenclature for bidirectional approaches
The bidirectional approach refers to an integration tactic using
a "two-way" lens that allows framing with both a quantitative
and qualitative lens. This can be achieved simultaneously or
iteratively. This yields three possible frameworks based on the
methodological and directional dimensions of an analysis.
The temporality in the bidirectional lenses is dependent on
how the analysis is initially framed, and not necessarily on the
weighting of the quantitative and qualitative components.
Simultaneous bidirectional framework for data
merging analytics
The simultaneous bidirectional framework involves a simul-
taneous quantitative and qualitative frame for merging.
Simultaneous is a key idea in this process as it reflects an
active back and forth, interactive consideration of both the

emerging quantitative and qualitative findings (Figure 3).
Thus, both the quantitative and qualitative results frame the
merging of the data.
Simultaneous bidirectional framework examples. An illustration
of simultaneous bidirectional lens can be seen in a convergent
MMR study of food safety knowledge in Hispanic families
(Stenger et al., 2014). Quantitative survey data and qualitative
interview data were collected and analyzed separately, and
then merged for interpretation. Using overarching dimen-
sions, qualitative themes were compared with survey results
to assess concordance. The results were combined in a joint
display, where the frame of the analysis was the overarching
themes (Stenger et al., 2014). Also, Andrew et al. (2011)
examined patient satisfaction with nursing care in a neurosur-
gical critical care unit. In a joint display, the researchers pre-
sented a matrix describing quantitative survey results of high,
medium, and low patient satisfaction scores with examples of
positive, negative, and "yes, but" comments from qualitative
interviews with patients. The quantitative and qualitative data
had equal weight during the integration, which enabled
researchers to move beyond the ceiling effect of quantitative
measures of patient satisfaction and to gain a more meaning-
ful explanation of patient satisfaction (Andrew et al., 2011).
Explanatory bidirectional framework for data
merging analytics
Merging analytics that include a bidirectional component, first
framed by the quantitative strand, then further considered by
the qualitative strand, is an explanatory bidirectional frame-
work. It is an iterative approach with an initial quantitatively
framed analysis that is followed by a qualitatively framed
analysis before reaching a final interpretation (Figure 4).
Explanatory bidirectional framework examples.The explana-
tory bidirectional framework is illustrated in a study looking
at a film intervention compared to lecture format control for
increasing suicide prevention among Japanese people. The
authors used a convergent MMR design simultaneously col-
lecting survey data and open text data in self-administered
survey format (Teo et al., 2016). The instruments addressed
awareness, self-efficacy, gatekeeper behavior, and social
norms, while three open-ended questions elicited the qualita-
tive data. For the analysis, three domains of focus in the
quantitative strand were used as a priori codes to search the
qualitative data. Subsequent to this analysis, the authors
examined the emerging themes from the qualitative text to
look for corroborative data from the quantitative dataset.
Exploratory bidirectional framework for data
merging analytics
Merging analytics that include a bidirectional component,
first framed by the qualitative strand, then further considered
by the lens of the quantitative strand, is an exploratory bidi-
rectional framework. It is an iterative approach with an ini-
tial qualitatively framed analysis that is followed by a
quantitatively framed analysis before reaching a final inter-
pretation by reconsidering the qualitative data (Figure 5).
Exploratory bidirectional framework examples. The exploratory
bidirectional framework is illustrated in an ongoing study
looking at quality of life in patients undergoing diagnostic
evaluations for cancer, where survey data and semi-struc-
tured interviews with patients were completed within the
same timeframe. An initial analysis is framed by themes of
high, intermediate, and poor quality of life as expressed by
the patients in qualitative interviews. Quantitative data are
then used to elaborate these results. Subsequently, quantita-
tive categories of high, intermediate, and poor quality of life
in relation to survey scores are being compared to corrobo-
rating themes in the qualitative interview data to achieve a
final interpretation.
Discussion
The full value of convergent MMR designs may be realized
only if researchers apply effective merging strategies in their
practice (Plano Clark et al., 2010). This article provides a
typology and rhetoric for methodologically framing the inte-
gration through merging in convergent MMR studies. While
existing terminology of "exploratory sequential" and
"explanatory sequential" relates to MMR designs (Creswell,
2015a; Fetters et al., 2013), the terminology of merging ana-
lytical procedures relates to the methodological frame of the
analysis. We believe that the similarity in language is a
strength as it builds on concepts that already exist in the
MMR literature.
The conceptual framework was developed while working
with integration through merging in empirical MMR studies.
We searched the literature to find examples of how research-
ers have used different merging approaches to enhance inter-
pretation of the integrated quantitative and qualitative data in
actual convergent studies. It was relatively easy to find stud-
ies using either an explanatory or exploratory unidirectional
framework. We also found studies using a simultaneous bidi-
rectional framework. We were less successful in identifying
studies using either the explanatory bidirectional or explora-
tory bidirectional framework. We suspect this is at least
partly attributable to the practice of authors truncating dis-
cussion in the methods and instead allocating words to the
results or discussion section due to word count restrictions.
Very few studies we identified were explicit about the
drivers of the analysis (Maiorana et al., 2012; Myers et al.,
2012), making it difficult not only to systematically search
and review the MMR literature but also to identify the ana-
lytical framework used in the integration of quantitative and
qualitative data. Several reviews have found that most MMR
papers lack clarity in whether the reported results stem from
Moseholm and Fetters 9
quantitative or qualitative findings, and papers are even less
clear when discussing their results and the basis of their con-
clusions (O'Cathain et al., 2008; Ostlund et al., 2011). We
suspect the lack of description may also be driven in part
due to the lack of a rubric and recognition of variation in
integration approaches. The introduced typology can be
used to fill this function.
The topic of merging analytical procedures in conver-
gent studies raises several questions. First, while there are
five possible approaches, we cannot comment whether one
is superior to the other. For example, is it preferable to
have a simultaneously bidirectional approach to the merg-
ing of data or is a bidirectional approach the most rigorous
method as it requires the researcher to be clear about the
underlying analytical frame guiding the analysis at specific
time points? We suspect that the answer is study specific.
There might also be situations where a unidirectional
framework is appropriate, for example, in a survey where
the qualitative data stem from one or two open-ended
questions. Although the choice of which framework to use
relates to the aim of the study, the design, and the weighing
of the quantitative and qualitative data, some recommen-
dations may be made. The unidirectional approach may be
suitable in convergent studies where there is a clear empha-
sis on either the quantitative or qualitative strand. The
simultaneous bidirectional approach may be suitable in
studies using matching, thereby a priori identifying the
domains used to frame the analysis. It is more difficult to
make recommendations for when to use the explanatory
and exploratory bidirectional frameworks, as this will be
largely dependent on the study aim, rationale for merging,
and the different types of data.
Second, there is the question of bias and/or preconcep-
tions, which relates to the underlying predominant
approach. Quantitative researchers typically attempt to
eliminate or control for bias. In contrast, qualitative
researchers actively seek to use their preconceptions to
understand qualitative findings. Sale et al. (2002) argue
that the distinction of the underlying methodology in MMR
research is crucial, and thus, researchers must be clear,
when merging two datasets, if the driver is a quantitative
frame (to control for bias) or a qualitative frame (to use
previous knowledge actively when analyzing the data). In
our opinion, the approach to bias/preconception should
follow the underlying predominant approach.
Being explicit about which analytical procedure frames
the analysis can contribute to researchers' understanding of
approaches available for merging the quantitative and quali-
tative components of a convergent MMR study; still, this
result does not imply the priority of one dataset over the
other. Instead of talking about priority of either the quantita-
tive or qualitative strands in a MMR study, Creswell (2015b)
argues that a clearer approach is to focus on the intent of the
MMR integration. Being clear on the intent entails clarity of
the merging analytical framework used in the integration.
Conclusion
Here, we have introduced a typology for methodologically
framing integration in convergent MMR studies, where the
aim is to merge quantitative and qualitative data. We have
reviewed three dimensions of data merging analytics: (1) the
relational dimension, (2) the methodological dimension, and
(3) the directional dimension. For the methodological and
directional dimensions, we introduce five different frame-
works for merging analytical procedures in convergent
mixed-methods studies. We illustrate the typology and pro-
vide examples showing how researchers have and can use
the different approaches in their analyses to enhance inter-
pretation of merged data. Introducing the idea of a uni- or
bidirectional approach to integration in MMR research pro-
vides a conceptual framework and rhetoric for researchers to
be explicit about the analytic strategy for merging quantita-
tive and qualitative data in their MMR studies.
