Systematic review of the epidemiological
evidence comparing lung cancer risk in smokers
of mentholated and unmentholated cigarettes
Peter N Lee
Abstract
Background: US mentholated cigarette sales have increased considerably over 50 years. Preference for
mentholated cigarettes is markedly higher in Black people. While menthol itself is not genotoxic or carcinogenic,
its acute respiratory effects might affect inhalation of cigarette smoke. This possibility seems consistent with the
higher lung cancer risk in Black men, despite Black people smoking less and starting smoking later than White
people. Despite experimental data suggesting similar carcinogenicity of mentholated and non-mentholated
cigarettes, the lack of convincing evidence that mentholation increases puffing, inhalation or smoke uptake, and
the similarity of lung cancer rates in Black and White females, a review of cigarette mentholation and lung cancer
is timely given current regulatory interest in the topic.
Methods: Epidemiological studies comparing lung cancer risk in mentholated and non-mentholated cigarette
smokers were identified from MedLine and other sources. Study details were extracted and strengths and
weaknesses assessed. Relative risk estimates were extracted, or derived, for ever mentholated use and for long-term
use, overall and by gender, race, and current/ever smoking, and meta-analyses conducted.
Results: Eight generally good quality studies were identified, with valid cases and controls, and appropriate
adjustment for age, gender, race and smoking. The studies afforded good power to detect possible effects.
However, only one study presented results by histological type, none adjusted for occupation or diet, and some
provided no results by length of mentholated cigarette use.
The data do not suggest any effect of mentholation on lung cancer risk. Adjusted relative risk estimates for ever
use vary from 0.81 to 1.12, giving a combined estimate of 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.84-1.02, n = 8), with no
increase in males (1.01, 0.84-1.22, n = 5), females (0.80, 0.67-0.95, n = 5), White people (0.87, 0.75-1.03, n = 4) or
Black people (0.90, 0.73-1.10, n = 4). Estimates for current and ever smokers are similar. The combined estimate for
long-term use (0.95, 0.80-1.13, n = 4) again suggests no effect of mentholation.
Conclusion: Higher lung cancer rates in Black males cannot be due to their greater preference for mentholated
cigarettes. While some study weaknesses exist, the epidemiological evidence is consistent with mentholation
having no effect on the lung carcinogenicity of cigarettes.
Background
According to Giovino et al. [1], who summarized evi-
dence from over 50 countries, the market share of
mentholated cigarettes is relatively high in the Philip-
pines (60%), Cameroon (35-40%), Hong Kong (26%), the
United States (26%) and Singapore (22%), though it is
less than 5% in half the countries considered. They
reported that, in the United States, Newport brands
accounted for 29.7% of all menthol sales, with Kool
(10.8%), Marlboro menthol (10.5%) and Salem (10.3%)
about equally distributed. According to Hebert and
Kabat [2], mentholated cigarettes were introduced in the
1930s, but did not exceed 3% of the total US market
until 1949, when a slow but steady rise in market share
began. The market share was 16% in 1963, rose to a
peak of 29% in 1979, and then declined somewhat, to
25%, in 1994-1998. The same authors [3] noted that

about one third of the total production of menthol
worldwide is used in the tobacco industry.
There has been increasing regulatory interest in the
possible direct or indirect contribution of cigarette addi-
tives generally to the occurrence of those diseases
resulting from cigarette smoking. This interest not only
concerns whether added ingredients may alter the inher-
ent disease risks of smoking, but also includes consid-
eration of whether ingredients may render cigarettes
more palatable, so as to increase initiation of smoking
or decrease the ability of smokers to quit. The Family
Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, signed
into law in the U.S.A. in mid-2009, included a specific
provision to ban characterizing flavouring ingredients
other than menthol from use in cigarettes. A further
review of the exemption of menthol is ongoing at the
time of writing, with an advisory report and opinion to
be provided to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
by the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee
(TPSAC) in 2011 (http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommit-
tees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/TobaccoProductsS-
cientificAdvisoryCommittee/default.htm). Similar
questions on whether added ingredients may increase
the risks, attractiveness or addictiveness of tobacco pro-
ducts have also been posed by the European Commis-
sion to the EU Scientific Committee on Emerging and
Newly-Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) (http://ec.
europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consultations/
public_consultations/scenihr_cons_12_en.htm), and the
process of public consultation on the SCENIHR pre-
consultation opinion on added ingredients is presently
ongoing.
The principal objective of this paper is to carry out a
systematic review, conducted according to the PRISMA
guidelines [4] of the epidemiological evidence comparing
the risk of lung cancer in smokers of mentholated and
non-mentholated cigarettes. As background to this
assessment it is helpful to start by summarizing other
relevant evidence related to menthol itself and to
mentholated cigarettes.
Menthol
Menthol (C10
H19
OH) is a monocyclic terpene alcohol
occurring as four pairs of optical isomers. (-) - Menthol,
often referred to as l-menthol, is the isomer most widely
seen in nature, and is the one assumed by the name
menthol. It occurs naturally in over 100 essential oils
[5], in high concentrations in peppermint oil (from
Mentha piperita) and cornmint, or Japanese, mint oil
(from Mentha arvensis), being readily extracted from
the plant by steam distillation [6]. It has a characteristic
peppermint odour and gives a cooling sensation when
applied to skin and mucosal surfaces [6]. It has been
widely used for many years, and there seems no reason
for concern that it is carcinogenic or genotoxic [7,8]. A
recent review [9] notes that menthol is currently
approved by the US FDA for use in over-the-counter
lozenges, topical preparations and vapour inhalation
products based on its antipuritic and antitussive proper-
ties, and is widely used as a food flavouring, for which it
is declared "Generally Recognized as Safe" (GRAS).
Eccles [6] has reviewed the evidence relating to possi-
ble effects of menthol, including nasal decongestant
activity, inhibition of respiratory reflexes, antitussive effi-
cacy, effects on mucus production and mucociliary
clearance, improvement of pulmonary function and
enhancement of sensations in the oral cavity. Although
the evidence is not always very clear, it suggests that
menthol has an acute effect on the mouth, nose and
respiratory tract and certainly leaves open the possibility
that menthol in cigarettes might affect puff volume,
depth of inhalation and other aspects of how a cigarette
is smoked. More recently, Garten and Falkner [10]
speculated that menthol might induce unconscious
breath holding, so allowing for greater transfer of
inhaled tobacco smoke constituents into the pulmonary
blood, and hence leading to an increased dependence on
nicotine and risk of tobacco attributable disease.
Mentholated cigarettes
Carcinogenicity, genotoxicity and pharmacological effects
While combustion of menthol under anaerobic pyrolysis
conditions can produce compounds such as 3,4-benz-
pyrene which are known carcinogens [11-13], menthol
pyrolysis in cigarettes does not give rise to any measur-
able amounts of 3,4-benzpyrene [9,14-19], and there are
no notable differences in benzpyrene between major US
mentholated and non-mentholated cigarette brands [20].
Two studies compared mouse skin activity of conden-
sates prepared from mentholated and non-mentholated
cigarettes, but found no significant difference in either
tumourigenic activity [21] or tumour promoting poten-
tial [22]. Gaworski et al. [5,23] reported results from
two 13-week inhalation studies where rats were exposed
to the smoke of cigarettes with or without added
menthol, or to filtered air. In the second experiment
[23], the test cigarette differed from the reference cigar-
ette in having various other flavour ingredients added as
well as menthol. In both studies, dose-related histo-
pathological changes, mainly of respiratory tract epithe-
lia, were found in rats exposed to mainstream smoke.
However, the changes were similar in cigarettes with
and without menthol, not neoplastic, and diminished
significantly after a 6-week recovery period. A later 90-
day study [24] also found no meaningful differences in
smoke-related changes between the mentholated and
non-mentholated cigarettes. Although these results pro-
vide no concern regarding possible carcinogenic effects

resulting from cigarette mentholation, it should be
noted that results of long term (2 yr+) inhalation studies
have never been reported.
Heck [9] recently reviewed evidence comparing the in
vitro cytotoxicity and genetic toxicity of smoke conden-
sates and gas-phase material from mentholated and
non-mentholated cigarettes, finding no meaningful
differences.
Effects on smoking characteristics
Many studies [25-44] have compared mentholated and
non-mentholated cigarette smokers on one or more of
the most commonly studied smoking indices: number of
puffs, puff volume, carbon monoxide (CO) and cotinine.
Nearly all the studies cited took into account possible
racial differences. Of seven studies investigating number
of puffs, four [25-28] found no significant effect of
mentholation, and three [29-31] reporting significantly
fewer puffs when smoking mentholated cigarettes. Of
six studies on puff volume, two studies [26,27] found no
effect, three [29-31] a significant decrease when smoking
mentholated cigarettes, and one [32] a significant
increase. While three studies [26,33,34] found an
increase in CO level associated with mentholation (and
one [30] claimed an increase not apparent from the ana-
lyses presented), many studies [25,28,29,31,35-39] found
no effect of mentholation, and one [27] reported
reduced CO in mentholated cigarette smokers. Three
studies [32-34] reported a significant increase in cotinine
level associated with mentholation, but nine studies
[27,37-44] did not, one of these[39] being based on
more subjects (3,341) than all the other studies com-
bined. Most of this evidence was considered in a review
in 2007 [45] which, taking also into account other evi-
dence (e.g. on heart rate, blood pressure, total particu-
late matter, and serum thiocyanate) concluded that
"Taken as a whole, the data provide little consistent sup-
port for the idea that mentholation may affect how a
cigarette is smoked so as to increase uptake of toxic
smoke constituents". A more recent review reached
similar conclusions [9].
Five studies have compared age of starting to smoke
in mentholated and non-mentholated cigarette smokers.
No significant differences were seen in the largest study
[46], which involved over 10,000 subjects and adjusted
for race, in two studies in Black people [47,48], or in
two other studies [49,50] which did not adjust for race.
Two very large studies [51,52], each of over 10,000
subjects, reported that, in both Black and White people,
mentholated cigarette smokers smoked significantly
fewer cigarettes per day than did non-mentholated
cigarette smokers. Reduced cigarette consumption has
also been reported in four other studies [39,50,53,54],
though two [53,54] did not adjust for race and one [39]
reported that the reduction was only evident in Black
people, with an increase in White people. However, no
significant difference was seen in another study of over
10,000 subjects [46] which did adjust for race, or in
other studies, three conducted in Black people
[47,48,55], one mainly in White people [56], and two
[49,57] which did not take race into account.
Sixteen studies have reported results on quitting, race
being accounted for in all but one [53]. The two largest
[46,52] found no difference by mentholation. No signifi-
cant differences were also seen in eight other studies
[47,49,54,56,58-61]. However, reduced quitting was
reported in six studies [48,50,53,62-64], though in two
of these [62,63], both trials of smoking cessation, the
lower quit rate in mentholated cigarette smokers was
only seen in the first month or so, longer follow-up of
the subjects finding no difference in quit rate. In one
study [64], the reduced rate of quitting was only evident
in Black and Hispanic people combined, a significantly
increased rate of quitting being seen in White people.
The evidence summarized above does not suggest that
mentholation of cigarettes is associated with an earlier
(or later) age of starting smoking or any increase in
cigarette consumption per smoker. Any effect on quit-
ting, if it exists, seems probably quite small.
Differences between Black and White people in the US
Relative use of mentholated cigarettes
Among United States smokers, preference for mentho-
lated cigarettes is much greater in Black than White
people. Data from the 2008 National Survey on Drug
Use and Health (NSDUH) presented in Table 1 show

the difference is clearly seen in both sexes and in all age
groups (except for 12-17 year-old females). It can also
be seen in earlier NSDUH surveys (see [45]). Despite
this marked difference, the much higher proportion of
White people implies that many more White than Black
people smoke mentholated cigarettes. The tendency for
Black people to prefer mentholated cigarettes has long
been evident. For example, in a national study in 1986
cited by the US Surgeon-General [65], 75.5% of Black
and 23.1% of White smokers used mentholated
cigarettes.
Relative lung cancer rates in Black and White people in the
US
United States data for 2001 to 2005 combined [66] show
that age-adjusted incidence rates were 36% higher in
Black men than in White men, and mortality rates 31%
higher. In females, however, incidence rates were 0.5%
lower and mortality rates 5% lower. Table 2 shows US
lung cancer mortality rates by race, gender, year (2000,
2005), and age. In both sexes, the ratio of rates in Black
people compared to White people tends to decline with
age, with the clearest excesses seen in younger males
(especially in 2000), lesser excesses seen in older males
and younger females, and no excess seen in older
females. Although it is often suggested (e.g. [17,67-69])
that the greater preference of Black people for mentho-
lated cigarettes might help explain their higher lung
cancer rates, the greater preference is similarly evident
in both genders, but the excess lung cancer rate is only
in males.
Differences in smoking habits between Black and White
people in the US
In the United States, there are other relevant differences
in smoking habits between White and Black smokers.
Table 3 summarizes findings from the National Health
Interview Survey for 2006. These are consistent with
other evidence (e.g. [17,46,65,70-72]) that Black people
have a slightly higher prevalence of smoking, a later age
of starting to smoke, a lower daily cigarette consump-
tion per smoker, a lower propensity to quit, and a pre-
ference for cigarettes higher in tar and nicotine.
According to Novotny et al. [70] the difference in smok-
ing prevalence by race disappears if adjustment is made
for occupation, education and other socioeconomic and
demographic factors, but the differences in amount
smoked per smoker and probability of quitting do not.
The evidence is also consistent that Black smokers
have higher cotinine levels than White smokers
[44,73-77]. In one large study [73] serum cotinine levels
averaged 210.2 ng/ml in White men, 244.8 ng/ml in
Black men, 176.4 ng/ml in White females and 251.2 in
Black females. After adjusting for age, education, gender,
cigarettes/day, nicotine content, years of smoking, inha-
lation frequency and ETS exposure, the difference was
estimated to be 83.3 ng/ml, with the higher level in
Black people significant for both mentholated cigarette
smokers (89.0 ng/ml) and non-mentholated cigarette
smokers (51.5 ng/ml).
Of the characteristics considered above, some would
predict lower lung cancer rates in Black people (fewer
ever smokers, later age of starting, and lesser amount
smoked per smoker) and some higher rates (more cur-
rent smokers, reduced quitting, higher tar level, and
higher cotinine levels).
Methods
Selection of studies
Studies selected satisfied four conditions: based on
research on humans, of cohort or case-control design,
any form of lung cancer as the outcome, and risk esti-
mates comparing mentholated and non-mentholated
cigarette smokers available or able to be calculated.
Relevant publications were initially sought from a
MedLine search conducted in August 2010, on "Lung
cancer and (menthol or mentholated cigarettes)" limited
to "Humans", from recent reviews relating to mentho-
lated cigarettes [9,45], and from reference lists of rele-
vant publications identified. Subsequently, in February

Relative risk estimates
For simplicity, the term "relative risk" (RR) is used gen-
erically in this paper to include various estimators of it,
including the odds ratio and the hazard ratio.
Studies varied in the extent to which they reported
estimates of RR with a 95% confidence interval (CI).
The reported estimates were supplemented by derived
estimates, in an effort to present, as far as possible, esti-
mates by extent of mentholated cigarette use and over-
all, by gender separately and combined, by race
separately and combined, by age groups separately and
combined, by histological type of lung cancer separately
and combined, in current or ever smokers separately
and combined, and also by extent of adjustment for
confounding variables. The full set of RR (CI) estimates
for each study, reported and derived, are given in the
tables which describe the results for each individual
study. Details of how the various estimates were derived
are given in additional file 1: Methods for deriving RR
estimates. Three main techniques were used: Unadjusted
estimates were derived from numbers of cases and con-
trols using standard methods [78], independent esti-
mates were combined using fixed-effect meta-analysis
[79], and non-independent estimates (relative to a com-
mon comparison group) were combined using the
method of Hamling et al. [80].
Summary of study characteristics, strengths and
weaknesses
The features of the studies were first described study-
by-study and then summarized in a table. For each of a
number of features (study type, location, timing, possible
overlaps between the studies, number of cases, adequacy
of cases, adequacy of controls, reliability of data col-
lected, adjustment for potential confounding variables,
and statistical methods used), the propensity for bias
was considered, and strengths and weaknesses of the
overall evidence of specific studies evaluated. Study
quality was also independently assessed, using the nine-
point Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale
(NOS) [81], by the author and a colleague (K.J.
Coombs), with any discrepancies resolved by discussion.
Meta-analyses
Fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses were con-
ducted, and heterogeneity chisquared statistics esti-
mated, using standard methods [79]. The principal
comparison was between smokers who had ever or
never used mentholated cigarettes, though as this was

not available in some studies RRs for similar compari-
sons (e.g. usual brand mentholated cigarettes or not;
current brand mentholated or not) were also included
in the meta-analysis. A secondary comparison used the
same comparison group (never or non-current mentho-
lated cigarettes), but assessed risk relating to long-term
use of mentholated cigarettes, using the maximum
extent of exposure available for the study (e.g. 20+ years
use or 32+ pack-years use). The main analyses used
combined estimates for the whole population studied,
but subgroup analyses give results by gender, race,
smoking status, study quality, study size (number of
cases in mentholated cigarette smokers), study design,
and publication date. Sensitivity analyses excluded the
smaller of these studies, where there was a possible
overlap in cases between studies. For the main analysis,
publication bias was investigated by Egger's test [82] and
by a funnel plot, in which the logarithm of the RR is
plotted against its (inverse-variance) weight.
Checking
Dr. J.S. Fry independently checked the extraction of data
from the source publications, the derivation of addi-
tional relative risk estimates and the conduct of the
meta-analyses. Any differences found were resolved in
discussion with the author.
Results
Studies identified
Eight epidemiological studies were identified that pro-
vided evidence on the relative risk of lung cancer asso-
ciated with cigarette mentholation. Six
[51,53,56,68,69,83] were identified from the MedLine
search conducted in August 2010, with a further two
[84,85] referred to in the review by Heck [9]. No further
relevant studies were identified from other sources,
including the later searches conducted in February 2011.
Fuller details of the sequence of searches made, and the
number of papers identified, rejected and accepted at
the various stages are shown in Figure 1.
Apart from a case-control study in Germany, reported
only as an abstract [84], all the studies were conducted
in the USA. Two of these are of prospective cohort
design [51,56], the remaining five being case-control stu-
dies [53,68,69,83,85]. In the following sections, the eight
studies are described in chronological order of publica-
tion and their relevant results summarized.
Study descriptions and results
American Health Foundation multicentre case-control study
The first paper [68] to report results relating use of
mentholated cigarettes to risk of lung cancer, published
in 1991, was based on data from a long-term multicen-
tre hospital case-control study. This involved patients
with tobacco-related cancers and controls - hospitalized
patients with conditions thought not associated with
smoking - matched to the cases on age, gender, race,
hospital and date of interview. The analyses were
restricted to current smokers of cigarettes (defined as
subjects who had smoked in the year preceding diagno-
sis) who were interviewed between 1985 and 1990 in
one of eight hospitals in four US cities. They included
588 male and 456 female histologically confirmed lung
cancer cases and 914 male and 410 female controls.
All patients were interviewed in hospital using a stan-
dard questionnaire. This contained questions on the
type of tobacco products used throughout life, brands of
cigarettes smoked, cigarettes per day, use of filter and
non-filter cigarettes, use of mentholated cigarettes, years
of smoking each brand and age at initiation. Information
on mentholation was obtained for each brand of cigar-
ette reported.
Table 4 summarizes the results of unconditional logis-
tic regression analyses used to estimate the risk of lung
cancer associated with smoking mentholated cigarettes
for 1-14 years or 15+ years relative to never having
smoked mentholated cigarettes, with adjustment for age,
race, education, cigarettes per day (of the current
brand), inhalation, duration of smoking, body mass
index and, where appropriate, also gender. Without
adjustment for potential confounding variables, use of
mentholated cigarettes was associated with a reduced
risk of lung cancer, not significantly in males (RR 0.92;
CI 0.73-1.17) but significantly in females (RR 0.56; CI
0.42-0.75). With adjustment for the variables noted
above, however, no significant association was seen
(males 1.06; 0.82-1.37, females 0.78; 0.57-1.08). Nor was
any association seen when results (only available for the
genders combined, and as adjusted relative risks) were
considered by histological type.
The authors concluded that: "Use of mentholated
cigarettes was not associated with increased risk of lung
cancer or of specific histological types of lung cancer in
this study" and noted that "If our results are confirmed
by other researchers, the implication would be that use
of mentholated cigarettes does not explain Black-White
differences in lung cancer incidence or time trends."
Kaiser Permanente prospective study
The second relevant paper identified [51], published in
1995, was based on data from the Northern California
Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in Oakland,
California. The study involved 5771 males and 5990
females aged 30 to 89 years who underwent a multipha-
sic health check-up between 1979 and 1985, reported
they were then current cigarette smokers who had
smoked for at least 20 years, and provided details of the
mentholation status of the brand of cigarettes they
usually smoked. Follow-up for lung cancer was

determined up to the end of 1991 with 318 incident
cases identified, 93 in mentholated cigarette users, 225
in non-mentholated cigarette users, 168 in males and
150 in females.
As shown in Table 5, risks for males were somewhat
higher in users than in non-users in every age group
and after adjustment for age, the RR could be estimated
as 1.40 (CI 1.01-1.94). This marginally statistically signif-
icant difference was also seen when adjustment was
made for age, race and education as well as years of
smoking and cigs/day (using a Cox proportional hazards
model), the RR given being 1.45 (1.03-2.02). In males,
duration of mentholated cigarette use also showed a sig-
nificant (p = 0.02) trend with risk of lung cancer. In
females, however, risk was somewhat less in users than
in non-users with the RR 0.71 (0.50-1.00) after adjust-
ment for age and 0.75 (0.51-1.11) after additional adjust-
ment for race, education, years of smoking and cigs/day.
When data for males and females were combined, with
additional adjustment for gender, no significant associa-
tion was seen.
The authors noted that additional adjustment for
aspects of smoking other than years of smoking and
cigs/day did not substantially alter the estimate of rela-
tive risk for mentholated cigarette use, and concluded
that: "This study suggests there is an increased risk of
lung cancer associated with mentholated cigarette use in
male smokers but not in female smokers."
Los Angeles County case-control study
Whereas the first two papers limited attention to cur-
rent cigarette smokers, the third [69] also considered
former smokers. This study, conducted in 1991-1994 in
Los Angeles County in California and reported in 1999,
was of population case-control design. Cases were histo-
logically confirmed and identified within seven months
of diagnosis. Controls under age 65 were randomly
selected from licensed drivers, whilst those over age 65
were randomly selected from Medicare Beneficiaries.
Cases and controls were frequency matched on age,
gender and race. Cases and controls had to be resident
in Los Angeles County, aged 40-84, able to complete a
questionnaire in English, be Caucasian (non-Hispanic)
or African American people, and with no previous can-
cer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer). Subjects
were interviewed regarding known and possible risk fac-
tors for lung cancer, including smoking history, occupa-
tional exposures, ETS exposure and family history of
lung cancer. Menthol smoking was classified based on
response to the question "On average over your lifetime,
out of every 100 cigarettes you smoked, how many were
menthol?".
Of 859 cases and 3193 potentially eligible controls,
353 cases and 724 controls were available for interview
and provided smoking information including menthol
status. The analysis was restricted to the cases (202
males and 135 females) and controls (349 males and
129 females) who had ever smoked (as many as 100
cigarettes in their life). The analyses presented used
unconditional logistic regression, with adjustment for
age, race, gender, total pack-years and years since quit-
ting smoking. Other potential confounding variables
(fruits, vegetables, occupational exposures, family history
and ETS) had no appreciable influence on the associa-
tion with mentholated cigarette smoking and were
therefore not included in the regression models.
RRs and CIs were presented by pack-years of mentho-
lated smoking (Table 6), percentage of mentholated
cigarettes smoked (Table 7) and type of cigarette smoker
(Table 8). RRs and CIs are available (or can be derived)
which are unadjusted, adjusted for the matching factors
gender, age and race, or adjusted for the matching fac-
tors as well as for total pack-years and years since quit-
ting smoking. No results are available for current and
former smokers separately. Results by pack-years of
mentholated smoking are separately available by gender,
and by race.
For all subjects, the RRs comparing smokers who have
ever and never used mentholated cigarettes are close to
1.0, when adjustment is made for the matching factors
and the smoking variables considered. Due to rounding
of RRs presented by level for the three aspects of
mentholated cigarette smoking, these calculated esti-
mates are not quite the same in the three tables, being
1.00 (CI 0.72-1.40), 1.01 (0.74-1.40) and 1.02 (0.74-1.40)
in Tables 6, 7 and 8 respectively. The results in Table 6
also show that the ever/never mentholated RR is quite
close to 1 for males (1.00; 0.68-1.48), females (0.88;
0.50-1.57), Caucasian people (1.02; 0.66-1.58) or Afri-
can-American people (0.89, 0.53-1.47). Nor is there any
evidence of any variation in risk by proportion of
mentholated cigarettes smoked (Table 7) or by cigarette
smoker type (Table 8). After adjustment for the match-
ing and smoking variables the RR was 1.04 (0.62-1.75)
for exclusive mentholated and 1.01 (0.71-1.42) for mixed
menthol/regular (non-mentholated), as compared to
exclusive regular.
The only apparent suggestion of an effect of mentho-
lated cigarette smoking is for the results by pack-years
(Table 6). In interpreting these results, it is important to
realise, that the RRs which are unadjusted or are
adjusted only for the matching factors may be biased by
the greater likelihood of inclusion of current and long
term smokers in the higher pack-years categories. When
adjustment is also made for total pack-years and years
since quitting, this bias should mainly be removed,
though there remains the possibility of some residual
confounding. After this adjustment there was no evi-
dence of any variation in risk by pack-years of

mentholation for the total population or for Caucasian
or African-American people separately. However, there
was some evidence that risk increased with pack-years
in males (RRs 1.00, 0.87, 1.21 and 1.48 for 0, 1-15, 16-
31 and 32+ pack-years, trend p = 0.25) and that risk
decreased with pack-years in females (RRs 1.00, 1.58,
0.51 and 0.41, trend p = 0.04).
The authors concluded that "Our results suggest that
the lung-cancer risk from smoking mentholated cigar-
ettes resembles the risk from smoking non-mentholated
cigarettes. Our data do not support the hypothesis that
the increased risk of lung cancer among African Ameri-
cans is due to the increased prevalence of menthol
smoking."
Slone Epidemiology Center study
The fourth paper [53], reported in 2003, also considered
ever smokers. It concerned a case-control study con-
ducted in 1981-2000 in hospitals in four eastern US
states. Cases were confirmed by review of pathology
reports, with the diagnoses made within 12 months of
admission. Controls were admitted for conditions unre-
lated to smoking. Cases and controls had to be aged 40-
74, have smoked cigarettes for at least 20 years and
have no history of cancer. 1300 cases and 9383 controls
met the initial eligibility criteria, but analysis was
restricted to those cases (435 males and 208 females)
and controls (2123 males and 1987 females) for whom
brand information could be identified for at least 60% of

the total duration of smoking (assuming that subjects
with an unknown brand history before 1956 smoked
non-mentholated cigarettes at that time). Analyses used
unconditional logistic regression with adjustment for
age, gender, race, year of interview and various smoking
variables (number of years of smoking, number of cigar-
ettes smoked per day, years since quitting smoking and
proportion of years smoking filter cigarettes).
The results shown in Table 9 provide no indication of
an effect of mentholation on lung cancer risk. In the
most adjusted analyses, RRs show no significant effect of
mentholation in males, females, White people or Black
people. Overall, ever using mentholated cigarettes is
associated with a RR of 0.89 (95% CI 0.89-1.14), and
there is no increase for > 15 years use (0.97; 0.70-1.34).
In the less adjusted analyses, RRs are always less than
1.00, and often significant, particularly in the crude ana-
lyses. This probably reflects uncontrolled confounding.
Additional analyses (Table 10) found no increased risk
of lung cancer according to the proportion of the
known smoking history where mentholated cigarettes
were used. Nor was any association seen with long term
(> 15 years) use of mentholated cigarettes in the alterna-
tive analyses shown in Table 11 that included different
subsets of smokers (current smokers, smokers of filter
cigarettes, smokers with full information on cigarette
type) or involved different assumptions concerning miss-
ing data on brand history.
The authors concluded that: "The results of this study
do not support the hypothesis that smoking menthol
cigarettes increases the risk of lung cancer relative to
smoking nonmenthol cigarettes."

Second American Health Foundation multicentre case-
control study
The fifth paper providing relevant results [83] was
reported in 2003. Unlike the previous papers, which
were primarily concerned with risk of lung cancer in
relation to mentholated cigarette use, the main objective
of this paper was to compare risk in White and Black
Americans. As for the first paper [68], it was based on
data from the American Health Foundation multicentre
hospital case-control study, though the subjects were
interviewed between 1984 and 1998 (rather than
between 1985 and 1990) and the hospitals involved were
not exactly the same. The controls were hospitalized
patients with conditions thought not to be associated
with smoking, and were matched to the cases on age,
gender, hospital and year of interview. The study
involved 1964 male and 1484 female histologically con-
firmed cases interviewed within a year of diagnosis, and
4931 male and 3220 female controls. Information relat-
ing to mentholation was limited to whether current
smokers preferred mentholated cigarettes or not, with
data available for an estimated 963 male and 803 female
cases and 1098 male and 572 female controls (assuming
this information was available for all the current
smokers).
The authors reported RRs (CIs) for menthol prefer-
ence separately by gender and race, none of which were
statistically significant. These were adjusted for age, edu-
cation, body mass index and pack-years. Table 12
includes these estimates, and also additional derived
estimates. The unadjusted estimates, and those adjusted
for gender and/or race are all under 1.00. Additional
adjustment for age, education, body mass index and
pack-years increased the RR somewhat, but none were
significant, and most under 1.00. For the overall data,
combined over genders and races, the most-adjusted RR
estimate was 0.83 (CI 0.68-1.02).
The authors noted that: "Smokers of menthol flavored
cigarettes were at no greater risk for lung cancer than
were smokers of unflavored brands."
German case-control study
The sixth study with relevant findings was reported as
an abstract in 2004 [84]. Unusually, this study was con-
ducted in Germany, in a white population. The study
was a hospital-based case-control study involving inci-
dent lung cancer cases (839 males and 165 females) and
the same number of population controls matched for
region, gender and age. Subjects were interviewed about
their smoking history including brand names, and ever
use of mentholated cigarettes was determined. After
adjustment for total amount of tobacco smoking and
also for the matching variables, via conditional logistic
regression, the RR for ever smoking menthol cigarettes
was 1.12 (CI 0.68-1.83). 5% of the cases and 4% of the

cigarettes.

controls had ever smoked mentholated cigarettes, imply-
ing an unadjusted RR of 1.26 (0.83-1.93).
It is not stated in the abstract whether the study was
restricted to current smokers or ever smokers or if it
included never smokers as well. The analysis would not
seem to make sense unless it was restricted to current
smokers or ever smokers. As the endpoint is ever use of
mentholated cigarettes, it seems likely that the study
concerned ever smokers.
The authors comment that "The present study gives
no indication for an additional risk of ever smoking
mentholated cigarettes if total amount of smoking is
taken into account. However, the number of exposed
subjects is small hindering definite conclusions with
respect to dose."
Lung health prospective study
The seventh paper to report results [56] was published
in 2007. It was based on data from the Lung Health
Study which, in 1986 to 1989, enrolled 3698 male and
2185 female smokers aged 35-60 years with mild to
moderate airways obstruction in a clinical trial of smok-
ing cessation. 1961 were randomly assigned to usual
care, and 3922 to one of two special interventions
(smoking intervention plus either an anticholinergic
bronchodilator or a placebo inhaler). The intervention
took place over a five-year period, with a follow-up at
year 11 and surveillance for mortality to year 14. At
baseline and at subsequent annual visits, subjects still
smoking were asked "What type of cigarettes are they?
Are they plain or menthol?".
The authors reported the results of Cox regression
analyses adjusted for age, gender, baseline cigarettes/day,
FEV1
(as percentage of predicted), randomization group,
race and baseline years of education for various causes
of death. For lung cancer, based on 240 deaths, the RR
for smoking mentholated cigarettes at baseline was esti-
mated as 0.96 (CI 0.70-1.32). No relationship was also
seen with mortality from any cause (0.997, 0.83-1.20),
coronary heart disease (1.31, 0.77-2.22), or cardiovascu-
lar disease (1.03, 0.70-1.52). No further lung cancer RRs
can be derived from the data presented.
The authors concluded that "our data contain no evi-
dence that mentholation of cigarettes increases the
hazards of smoking."
Houston case-control study
The final paper [85], published in 2008, was concerned
with the development of a lung cancer prediction model
for Black people. It was based on a case-control study
conducted in hospitals in Houston from 1995 to 2005.
The cases were newly/recently diagnosed, histopatholo-
gically confirmed, untreated lung cancers without prior
chemotherapy, radiotherapy or recent blood transfusion.
Controls, matched to the cases on age, gender and race,
came from community centres and a multispecialty phy-
sicians' group practice. The analysis focused on cases
(294 males and 197 females) and controls (244 males
and 253 females) who reported being Black (African-
American) people. Analyses of mentholated cigarette
use were conducted separately in current smokers and
in former smokers.
As shown in Table 13, there was no evidence of an
increased risk associated with mentholated cigarette use
in any analysis. After adjustment for age, gender and
smoking status (current/former smoker), the RR was
estimated as 0.81 (0.60-1.09). The authors also noted
that, in current smokers, the reduced RR associated with
mentholated use (0.69, 0.46-1.03) was non-significant,
and remained so after stratification by pack-years. They
also reported results of multivariate risk modelling

involving a range of risk factors for lung cancer. Vari-
ables retained in the final model were smoking status,
pack-years of smoking, age at smoking cessation, expo-
sure to asbestos or dusts, and history of COPD or hay
fever, but not use of mentholated cigarettes.
The authors noted that "In our analysis, we observed
no significant risks of lung cancer among former or cur-
rent smokers who reported smoking mentholated cigar-
ettes (OR range 0.69-0.99), and our data suggested a
possible protective effect of mentholated cigarettes for
current smokers."
Study characteristics, strengths and weaknesses
The main features of the eight studies are presented in
Table 14 and summarized in Table 15. These features
are discussed below, with comments where relevant on
the strengths and weaknesses of the studies.
Study type
The eight studies covered the three most common types
of design used in epidemiological research, with two
prospective cohort studies [51,56], three hospital case-
control studies [53,68,83] and three population case-
control studies [69,84,85]. One of the cohort studies
[56] was based on follow-up subjects entering a clinical
trial. The prospective design virtually excludes the possi-
bility of recall bias. However, both such studies based
their analysis on use of mentholation at baseline, which
could be over 10 years before the lung cancer occurred,
and might have changed during the follow-up period.
Neither of these studies concerned representative sam-
ples. The clinical trial [56] concerned subjects with mild
or moderate airways obstruction, while subjects in the
Kaiser Permanente study [51] had to attend for multi-
phasic health check-up and were noted to be somewhat
more educated than the local population and under-
representative of the extremes of wealth and poverty.
However, any differential risk of mentholated and non-
mentholated cigarettes seems unlikely to vary by educa-
tion, income or prevalence of airway obstruction, so bias
should not occur. While case-control studies suffer from
the problem that exposure is determined after onset of
disease, it is unclear, however, why accuracy of reporting
relative use of mentholated and non-mentholated cigar-
ettes should differ materially between lung cancer cases
and controls.
Location
All but one of the studies were conducted in the United
States. The study in Germany [84], reported as an
abstract, involved a population where mentholated
cigarette use is quite low, and its results, based on a
relatively small number of lung cancer cases in mentho-
lated cigarette smokers, contribute relatively little to the
meta-analyses described later.
Timing
The studies considered started between 1979 and 1995.
Inasmuch as mentholated cigarettes only reached an
appreciable market share in the 1960s and 1970s, one
might expect studies starting later to have more chance
of detecting possible effects. However, data by period of
mentholated cigarette use were only reported in the first
four reported studies [51,53,68,69], limiting the ability to
determine lung cancer risk for very long term (e.g. 40+
years) use. However, any major difference in risk
between the two types of cigarette might be expected to
emerge in the studies so far conducted.
Possible overlaps between the studies
It is clear from the information on study location and
timing in Table 14, that double-counting of cases is only
a possible problem for the three hospital case-control
studies. Though the range of years and hospitals varied
between the studies, it is likely that there was some
overlap in the patients considered. Without reference
back to the original data, there is no completely satisfac-
tory solution to this. To avoid loss of power, our main
analyses include the data from all the studies, ignoring
the overlap, though it is recognized that this may
slightly overstate statistical significance. However, as a
sensitivity test, some analyses were also run excluding
the results from two of these three studies, the first
American Health Foundation Study [68] and the Slone
Epidemiology Center Study [53], only retaining results
from the second American Health Foundation Study
[83], the study with the largest number of lung cancer
cases in mentholated cigarette smokers.
Number of cases and power to detect an effect
The number of cases considered in the analyses ranged
from 240 in the Lung Health study [56] to 1766 in the
second American Health Foundation multicentre study
[83]. Four studies involved over 500 cases and three

over 1000. All studies involved both males and females.
The proportion of those cases which reported use of
mentholated cigarettes was only 4% in the German
study [84] but was much higher in the US studies, vary-
ing from about 20% in three studies [53,56,83] to over
40% in two [69,85]. This variation would depend on the
actual questions asked and where the study was con-
ducted. One of the studies [85] was conducted in Black
people. Based on the most adjusted results for the total
population studied, all the US studies would have
detected as significant, at the 95% confidence interval,
an excess risk associated with mentholated cigarette
smoking of between 20% and 40%. The German study
was less powerful and would only have detected an
excess risk of about 65%.
Adequacy of the cases
Five of the case-control studies confirmed the diagnosis
by histology/pathology, but the German case-control
study [84] gave no details. In all these studies, the lung
cancer was recently diagnosed. One of the cohort stu-
dies [51] gave no information regarding diagnosis of
their incident cases, but the other [56], which only con-
sidered deaths, classified cause of death based on a
review of death certificates, autopsy reports, relevant
medical records, and interviews with attending physi-
cians. There is abundant evidence that an in-life

diagnosis of lung cancer is unconfirmed by autopsy
diagnosis in a moderate proportion (perhaps 10% or so)
of cases [86]. Since only one of the studies [56] seemed
to consider autopsy evidence, it is likely that some of
the cases included were false-positives. However, the
procedures taken in most, if not all, of the studies
would have greatly reduced this possibility. Although
knowledge of smoking habits may affect the likelihood
of a lung cancer being detected in life [87,88], it seems
implausible that knowledge of mentholation status
would do so. It is therefore unlikely that inaccuracy of
diagnosis will have had any material effect in these
studies.
Adequacy of the controls
The three hospital case-control studies [53,68,83] used
patients with diseases unrelated to smoking as controls.
The descriptions of the controls used were as follows:
American Health Foundation Study [68] "Controls
were hospitalized patients with conditions thought not
be associated with smoking, including: cancers (of the
colon, stomach, female breast, prostate, and skin, as well
as leukaemia, lymphoma, sarcomas, etc.); benign neo-
plastic diseases; and non-neoplastic conditions (such as
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, eye
conditions, injuries, etc.)."
Slone Epidemiology Center study [53] "Controls had
been admitted for conditions judged to be unrelated to
cigarette smoking. The most common control diagnoses
included cancers or benign tumors of the breast, colon
and rectum, prostate, and other non-tobacco-related
sites (45 percent); diseases of the digestive (14 percent),
genitourinary (10 percent), or musculoskeletal (7 per-
cent) systems; and injury (13 percent). Respiratory or
upper gastrointestinal conditions, regardless of etiology,
were excluded."
Second American Health Education Study [83] "Eli-
gible control diagnoses excluded tobacco-related dis-
eases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral
vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
gastric ulcer, cirrhosis of the liver, and cancers of the
mouth, larynx, esophagus, bladder, kidney, pancreas, or
liver." They go on to note the percentage of male and
female controls with specific diseases.
When discussing the first of these three studies [68],
Sidney et al. [51] claimed that "some of these conditions
might have been associated with menthol use, obscuring

an association with lung cancer". However, it seems
rather unlikely that a disease that is not affected by
smoking non-mentholated cigarettes would be affected
by smoking mentholated cigarettes. Risk of some of the
cancers (stomach, breast, and perhaps colon) may,
according to recent evidence, be moderately associated
with smoking. However, as they form only a proportion
of the total controls, and may not be related to menthol
use anyway, it seems unlikely that their inclusion would
have caused material bias.
Of the three population case-control studies
[69,84,85], the one conducted in Germany [84] was
reported only as an abstract with no details given of
how the controls were derived.
In the Los Angeles county study [69], the population
controls used were derived from registers of licensed
drivers aged under 65 and of Medicare Beneficiaries
aged over 65. However, there seems no guarantee that
cases aged under 65 could drive or that cases aged over
65 used Medicare. If ability to drive or use of Medicare
is associated with use of mentholated cigarettes, some
bias might occur.
In the Houston study of Black people [85], the cases
and controls were drawn only from the metropolitan
area of Houston. While the cases were recruited "from
the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
and the Michael E. De Bakey VA Medical Center", the
controls were recruited "from Houston area community
centers and the Kelsey-Seybold Clinic, Houston's largest
multispeciality physicians group practice". It is not
apparent how representative the controls were of the
population from which the cases were drawn.
In both these studies there was no clear difference in
response rate between cases and controls. This was sta-
ted to be about 75% in both cases and controls in the
Houston study [85] and can be estimated as 70% in
cases and 75% in controls in the Los Angeles County
study [69]. Response rates were not given for the Ger-
man study [84] or for two of the case-control studies
[53,68], but in the second American Health Foundation
study [83], it was noted that "approximately 85% of eli-
gible patients who were approached agreed to be inter-
viewed", though separate figures for cases and controls
were not given.
Reliability of the data collected
All the studies are limited by possible inaccuracies in
the reporting of smoking history and mentholation sta-
tus. Random errors tend to bias relative risk estimates
towards 1.0 and reduce the power of the study to detect
a true effect. However, errors may not be random. For
example, subjects may tend to think their past habits
were more like their current habits than they actually
were.
The source of the data on mentholation is summar-
ized in Table 16. As can be seen, this varies from study
to study. Four of the studies [51,53,68,84] were asked
about brand smoked. In two of these studies [51,53],
subjects were also asked whether they smoked mentho-
lated cigarettes but no mention is made of any cross-
check being made with the brands reported. One of the
studies reporting results for ever smokers [53] only
asked about the most recent brand and that used for
the longest period, resulting in incomplete information
on mentholated cigarette use for many subjects.
The effect that error in determining mentholation sta-
tus might have had on the relative risk estimates is not
clear. Inasmuch as mentholated cigarettes have a dis-
tinctive taste, any errors may not be too great.
In the Slone Epidemiology Center study [53], subjects
with an unknown brand history before 1956 were
assumed to have smoked non-mentholated cigarettes at
that time. This would probably have led to some over-
estimation of the numbers of non-mentholated cigarette
smokers and slightly reduced the power to detect effects
of mentholation. However, as the assumption applied
equally to cases and controls, this is unlikely to have
caused material bias.
Adjustment for potential confounding variables
Except for the German study [84] and the Houston
study of Black people [85], all the studies either adjusted
for race, or presented race-specific results from which
race-adjusted overall results could be calculated. All the
studies adjusted for age, and all either adjusted for gen-
der or presented results from which gender-adjusted
overall results could be calculated.
All the studies adjusted for smoking variables, with
three studies adjusting for cigarettes per day and dura-
tion of smoking [51,53,68] and three studies adjusting
for indices of total exposure - pack-years [69,83] or total
amount smoked [84]. Some of these six studies adjusted
for additional variables: inhalation [68], time used filter
cigarettes [53] and in two studies of ever (rather than
current) smokers, years since quitting [53,69]. The most
limited adjustments are in the Lung Health study [56]
which only adjusted for baseline cigarettes/day, the
Houston study [85], where results were only available
adjusted for current/former smoking, and the German
study [84], which appeared to present results for ever
smokers but only adjusted for total amount smoked,
without taking quitting into account.
Education was adjusted for in four studies
[51,56,68,83] and body mass index in two [68,83], with
other variables adjusted for being year of interview [53]
and FEV1
and randomization group [56]. It is of interest
that none of the studies adjusted for occupational expo-
sure, which one might expect to vary by mentholated

cigarette use (though partially controlled by adjustment
for race), and none adjusted for diet.
Generally, the papers did not present results that
allowed the reader to determine the effect adjustments
for individual variables had on the relative risk esti-
mates. Also, no paper discusses the appropriateness or
otherwise of adjusting for smoking characteristics,
such as amount smoked or inhalation which may be
affected by the choice of brand smoked. There are two
conflicting issues here. One is wishing to guard
against any potential bias arising if the sort of person
who chooses mentholated cigarettes is a more (or less)
"addicted" smoker than the sort of person who
chooses non-mentholated cigarettes. The other is that
if, say, switching to mentholated cigarettes results in
an increase in daily consumption with no change in
risk per cigarette, adjusting for amount smoked will
lead to the impression that mentholation is risk free
when it is not. Ideally, the comparison should be
between switchers to mentholated cigarettes and non-
switchers, adjusted for smoking characteristics before
the switch, but such analyses seem never to have been
attempted.
Statistical methods used
Generally, the statistical methods used were standard,
with Cox proportion hazards modelling used for the two
prospective studies [51,56], and unconditional logistic
regression used for all the case-control studies, except
the German study [84] which used conditional logistic
regression analysis. Four of the case-control studies
which used a matched design [68,69,83,85] used uncon-
ditional logistic regression, so did not specifically take
the matching into account. This was no doubt to avoid
loss of power, as some case-control pairs where one
subject had never smoked (or in some studies been a
former smoker) would not have contributed to a condi-
tional analysis. However, the studies generally took into
account most of the matching variables as adjustment
variables in analysis. Exceptions were hospital and date
of interview in the two American Health Foundation
studies [68,83].
Results by histological type
Only one study, the first reported [68], gave results by
histological type. This is a limitation of the available
data.
NOS study quality score
Of the two cohort studies, the Kaiser Permanente Study
[51] scored 9 out of a possible 9, while the Lung Health
Study [56] scored 8, the only weakness being the unre-
presentativeness of the cohort, with mild or moderate
airways obstruction. All of the six case-control studies
scored between 5 and 7, the commonest weaknesses
being lack of blind ascertainment of exposure in all six
studies, failure to demonstrate that lung cancer cases
had been excluded from the controls in four studies, use
of hospital controls in three studies, and differing
response rates (or lack of information on response rates)
in three studies. Wells et al [81] do not specify a parti-
cular cut-off value for "good quality" studies, and in the
meta-analyses following results are compared between
those three studies with scores of 7 to 9 and the other
five studies with scores of 5 to 6. Fuller details of the
study quality scoring are available in additional file 2:
Study quality.
Table 16 Source of data on mentholation status in the lung cancer studies
Study Data collected
American Health Foundation study
[68]
Subjects were asked about lifetime history of brands of cigarettes smoked (up to 7 brands per person) and
information was obtained on whether all brands reported were mentholated or not. If the brand name could
not be recalled, the mentholation status was recorded.
Kaiser Permanente study [51] Subjects were asked about the brand of the cigarette currently smoked and on whether the brand was
mentholated or not. The authors did not report that they had obtained information on which brands were
mentholated, or that they had checked one answer against the other.
Los Angeles County study [69] Mentholated cigarette use was based on the question "On average over your lifetime, out of every 100
cigarettes you smoked, how many were menthol?"
Slone Epidemiology Center study
[53]
Subjects were asked about the most recent brand and the brand used for the longest period of time to
determine the brand name and whether it was mentholated or not. The consistency of the brand name and
menthol status was not checked. In some analyses, cigarettes smoked prior to 1956 were assumed not to be
mentholated.
Second American Health
Foundation study [83]
Details are not given in the methods, but the variable analyzed related to whether current smokers preferred
mentholated cigarettes.
German study [84] Subjects were asked about their smoking history including brand names, with exposure to mentholated
cigarettes derived from the brand names blinded for case-control studies.
Lung Health study [56] At baseline subjects were asked "Do you now smoke cigarettes?" followed by "What type of cigarettes are
they? Are they plain or menthol?" Similar questions were asked at annual follow-ups but the answers were not
used in the analyses related to risk of lung cancer.
Houston study [85] Smokers were asked to report their use of mentholated cigarettes, with ever use the endpoint used for
analysis.

Meta-analysis of results for use of mentholated cigarettes
Use of mentholated cigarettes
Table 17 summarizes available RRs and CIs for use of
mentholated cigarettes from the eight studies by gender,
race and overall. As is evident, the definition of use varies
between study, with five studies [53,68,69,84,85] compar-
ing ever and never users of mentholated cigarettes, and
three [51,56,83] using alternative comparisons, based on
the current or usual brand smoked. The RRs are adjusted
for age, gender (where relevant), race (where relevant),
smoking habits and other variables. Where the source
provides multiple adjusted RRs, those adjusted for the
most variables are presented in Table 17. The only indivi-
dual RRs in the table that are statistically significant at p
< 0.05 are the increased risk (RR 1.45, CI 1.03-2.02) in
males observed in the Kaiser Permanente study [51], and
the decreased risks observed in the Second American
Health Foundation study [83] in females (0.66, 0.46-0.95)
and in White people (0.76, 0.60-0.96).
Table 18 gives the results of various meta-analyses.
None show significant (p < 0.05) heterogeneity between
estimates, and, although random-effects estimates are
referred to in the text below, fixed-effect and random-
effects estimates are practically the same.
Based on the overall result from each study, and pre-
ferring results for ever smokers to results for current
smokers where there is a choice (in the Houston study
[85]), the meta-analysis estimate (RR 0.93, CI 0.84-1.02)
shows no excess lung cancer risk for mentholated over
non-mentholated cigarettes (see also Figure 2). This is
also true for estimates subdivided by study design, NOS
study quality score, study size or year of publication, or
when results from the first two hospital case-control
studies [53,68] were excluded to avoid possible double-
counting of some cases. Five of the studies
[51,53,68,69,83] gave gender-specific results with the
meta-analysis estimate not significantly increased in
males (1.01, 0.84-1.22), despite the significant increase
seen in the Kaiser Permanente study [51], and signifi-
cantly decreased in females (0.80, 0.67-0.95). Three of
the studies [53,69,83] gave results separately by race,
with one study conducted in White people [84] and one
in Black people [85]. The meta-analyses show no evi-
dence of an effect of mentholation in either White (0.87,
0.75-1.03) or Black (0.90, 0.73-1.10) people. Replacing
the ever smoker estimate from the Houston study [85]
by that for current smokers made little difference to the
overall estimate (which became 0.92 (0.84-1.02)), or that
for Black people (which became 0.88 (0.70-1.10)). Nor is
there any evidence of an effect overall in ever smokers
specifically (0.91, 0.78-1.07) or in current smokers speci-
fically (0.91, 0.81-1.03). Only one study provided an esti-
mate for former smokers and that (0.99, 0.62-1.56) also
showed no effect.
Only one study [68] gave estimates by lung cancer
type, but, as shown in Table 4, there was no evidence of
an effect of mentholation for any of the four lung cancer
types studied.
Only one study [51] gave estimates by age group. As
shown in Table 5, there was no indication of heteroge-
neity by age, the (gender-specific) RRs for the four age
groups being consistent with those for the combined
age groups.
Only one study [83] provided estimates jointly by race
and gender, but, as shown in Table 12, none of these
were statistically significant.
Three of the studies [53,69,83] presented comparable
RR estimates that were similarly adjusted for non-smok-
ing variables but were either adjusted or not adjusted
for smoking. In the Los Angeles County study [69],
adjustment for smoking habits increased the overall RR
from 0.87 (0.66-1.15) to 1.00 (0.72-1.40), in the Slone
Epidemiology Center study [53], adjustment increased it
from 0.70 (0.57-0.88) to 0.89 (0.69-1.14), and in the Sec-
ond American Health Foundation study [83], adjustment
increased from 0.66 (0.56-0.79) to 0.83 (0.68-1.02). As
discussed earlier, the extent to which adjustment for
smoking habits should be carried out is open to ques-
tion. However, these results do not suggest that the fail-
ure to find an increased risk from mentholated
cigarettes depends crucially on smoking adjustment.
For the principal meta-analysis, for which the data are
shown in Figure 2, there was no indication of publica-
tion bias, as assessed by Egger's test[82] or by a funnel
plot (Figure 3).
Meta-analysis of results for long-term use of mentholated
cigarettes
Table 19 summarizes available RRs and CIs for long
term use of mentholated cigarettes from the four studies
providing relevant data. The definitions of long term use
vary by study, two studies giving results for 15+ years
use, one for 20+ years use, and one for 32+ pack-years
of use. As for Table 17, the RRs are always the most-
adjusted available. None of the individual RRs shown in
Table 19 are statistically significant.
Table 20 gives the results of meta-analysis overall and
by gender and race. None of the random-effects esti-
mates suggest any effect of long term mentholation use
on risk of lung cancer, either overall (RR 0.95, CI 0.80-
1.13 - see also Figure 4 - or for males (1.13, 0.86-1.47),
females (0.78, 0.60-1.01), White (1.02, 0.71-1.46) or
Black (0.96, 0.71-1.30) people. However, there are few
estimates, four for the overall results and those by gen-
der, and only two for the results by race. No significant
heterogeneity was evident in any of the analyses.
Some of these studies also report other results by
extent of use of mentholated cigarettes. In the Los
Lee BMC Pulmonary Medicine 2011, 11:18
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2466/11/18
Page 20 of 28
Angeles County Study [69], no excess risk was seen
comparing ever smokers with 75-100% mentholated
cigarette use with those with 0% use (1.02, 0.65-1.63) or
comparing those with exclusive mentholated cigarette
use with exclusive regular cigarette use (1.04, 0.62-1.75).
Nor were significant effects of mentholation seen when
the 32+ pack-years category was subdivided into 32-53
and 54+ pack years, RRs based on limited data being
0.76 (0.37-1.59) and 1.38 (0.56-3.40). In the Slone Epide-
miology Center study [53], ever smokers with 50% or
more mentholated cigarette use had no excess risk com-
pared to those with no use (0.89, 0.65-1.22). That study
also presented estimates of risk for > 15 years use of
mentholated cigarettes alternative to that of 0.89 (0.69-
1.14) used in Tables 19 and 20. As shown in Table 11,
no association was seen with lung cancer risk whether
different subsets of smokers were used or whether dif-
ferent assumptions were made concerning data on
brand history.
Can mentholation explain the higher lung cancer risk in
US Black people?
It is often suggested, e.g. [17,67-69], that the greater
preference of Black people for mentholated cigarettes
might help to explain the higher lung cancer rates seen
in Black males compared to White males. However, the
epidemiological findings would appear to argue other-
wise. For mentholation to be the major cause one would
expect to see a substantially higher risk of lung cancer
in mentholated cigarette smokers, but this is not the
case. Table 21 presents approximate calculations sug-
gesting that explaining the 36% increase in incidence
and 31% increase in mortality reported in Black males
compared to White males [66] requires the relative risk
of lung cancer associated with mentholation to be about
1.7 or 1.8. In fact, as shown in Table 18, the relative risk
for mentholation estimated from the combined available
evidence is 0.93, with an upper 95% confidence limit of
only 1.02, far less than 1.7 or 1.8. Even for long term
use (see Table 20) the estimate of 0.95 has an upper
95% confidence limit of only 1.13. Though a small con-
tribution of mentholation to the excess risk in US Black
people cannot be ruled out, a major contribution seems
totally implausible based on the available data. The fact
that Black females, compared to White females, are
much more likely to use mentholated cigarettes but
have quite similar lung cancer mortality, strengthens
this view.
Discussion
As noted earlier, there has been increasing regulatory
interest in the possible contribution of additives to the
carcinogenicity of cigarettes, both in the United States
and Europe. In principle, menthol is by far the easiest
to study, as brand names clearly identify whether or
not the cigarette is mentholated, and smokers will be
well aware anyway whether the cigarettes they are
smoking are mentholated. Also mentholated cigarettes

are quite widely smoked, particularly in the United
States, especially in Black people who have a much
greater preference for them than do White people (see
Table 1).
While menthol itself has been widely used for many
years and experimental studies provide no reason for
concern that it is genotoxic or carcinogenic [7,8], there
is a suggestion that its acute effects on the mouth, nose
and respiratory system [6] may affect how smoke from
cigarettes is inhaled [10]. Coupled with evidence in the
United States that Black males have markedly higher
lung cancer rates than do White males (see Table 2),
despite Black people smoking less heavily and tending
to start smoking later in life than do White people (see
e.g. Table 3), it is often suggested (e.g. [17,67-69]) that
mentholation of cigarettes may increase the risk of lung
cancer.
The main objective of this paper is to investigate this
possibility by a direct epidemiological comparison of
risk in mentholated and non-mentholated cigarette smo-
kers. However, it should be noted that various other
pieces of evidence argue against this possibility. First,
data from a number of studies (see e.g. [9,45]) provide
no convincing evidence that mentholation increases
puffing, inhalation or tobacco smoke uptake. Also, Black
females have similar lung cancer rates (see Table 2) to
White females, despite the preference for mentholated
cigarettes in Black people being at least as great in
females as in males (see Table 1). It should also be
noted that, as described in the Background section,
there are other differences in smoking characteristics
between Black and White people, with Black people
being more likely to be current smokers, less likely to
quit, tending to choose higher tar cigarettes and having

higher cotinine levels. Other differences between Black
and White people may also be relevant, for example in
body mass index, access to health care and metabolism.
Although mentholated cigarettes have assumed an
important place in the United States cigarette market
over the last 50 years, and the number of published epi-
demiological studies of smoking and lung cancer is
extremely large, relatively few publications provide infor-
mation comparing risk in smokers according to use of
mentholated cigarettes.
While only eight relevant studies were identified, and
two of the papers reporting on this relationship [83,85]
did not have mentholation as a central interest and one
[84] was published only as an abstract, the data available
to study effects of mentholation seem quite good. The
studies are reasonably large, involving in total some
1200 lung cancers in mentholated cigarette smokers and
are of standard designs analysed by standard methods.
Cases are generally histopathologically confirmed, with
selection of controls unlikely to cause relevant bias. All
the studies take age, gender, race and other aspects of
smoking into account in their analyses, with some
adjustment for other potential confounding variables
such as education and body mass index.
Nevertheless, the studies have limitations. These
include failure to present results by histological type
(except in one study [68]), failure to adjust for occupa-
tion or diet, and failure to report results by length of
use of mentholated cigarettes in the later published stu-
dies [56,83-85] - important as the earlier studies
[51,53,68,69] had insufficient subjects who smoked
mentholated cigarettes for a long time. One would like
to be able to compare subjects who smoked only
mentholated or only non-mentholated cigarettes for 30
years or more.
Another issue is the extent and reliability of the data
on lifetime use of mentholated cigarettes. Some studies
only collected or analyzed information on brand cur-
rently smoked [51,56,83] or on a few brands smoked
during lifetime [53], and some studies collecting data on
names of brands smoked and whether the brand was
mentholated [51,53] seemed not to cross-check this
information. The reliability of statements on brands
smoked years ago is in any case questionable [89].

c The source of the relative risk estimates of 9.36 for ex smokers and 22.36 for current smokers is the 1989 US Surgeon-General's Report Table 6 p150 [65]. As
they are based on Cancer Prevention Study II starting in 1982, a study in a predominantly White population, the relative risk estimates have been assumed to
apply to non-mentholated cigarette smokers. RR is the assumed relative risk for mentholated compared to non-mentholated cigarette smoking.

The analyses presented are typically adjusted for smok-
ing habits, such as daily cigarette consumption and dura-
tion of smoking. This is an attempt to compare
mentholated and non-mentholated cigarette smokers with
an equivalent smoking history. None of the analyses have
attempted to account for the possibility that switching
from non-mentholated to mentholated cigarettes might be
associated with changes in cigarette consumption.
The combined data from the eight studies are not at all
suggestive of any effect of mentholation on lung cancer
risk. Meta-analysis of adjusted RRs for ever use give a
combined estimate of 0.93 (95% CI 0.84-1.02), with indivi-
dual estimates showing remarkably little heterogeneity,
varying only from 0.81 to 1.12. The same is true for long-
term use, where the combined estimate of 0.95 (0.80-1.13)
is again based on consistent individual estimates, varying
from 0.88 to 1.10. There is also no evidence of an increase
in males or females separately, in Black or White people
separately or in estimates for ever smokers, current smo-
kers or former smokers. Limited data on risk by age and
by histological type of lung cancer also suggest no effect of
mentholation. There is a question as to the validity of
adjustment for aspects of smoking habits that might be
affected by use of mentholated cigarettes, but the esti-
mates that are adjusted only for non-smoking variables
tend to be lower. Overall the data, taken as a whole, could
hardly be more indicative of a lack of relationship.
For mentholation to explain the increased lung cancer risk
in Black compared to White males of some 30-35% would
require a relative risk of about 1.7 to 1.8. The excess risk,
therefore, cannot possibly be explained by the much greater
preference of Black people for mentholated cigarettes.
Conclusion
While there are some weaknesses in the studies present-
ing data, discussed in detail in the report, the evidence
taken as a whole is certainly consistent with the addition
of menthol to tobacco having no effect on the lung car-
cinogenicity of cigarettes. The much greater preference
for mentholated cigarettes in Black people in the United
States cannot possibly explain their higher lung cancer
risk, which in any case in evident only in men.
