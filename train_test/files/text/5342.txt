Personal Meaning Orientations
and Psychosocial Adaptation in
Older Adults
Gary T. Reker1 and Louis C. Woo1
Abstract
This study examined how different patterns of sources of meaning in life impact the psychosocial adaptation of older adults. A
total of 120 (62 women and 58 men) community-residing older adults completed self-report measures of sources of meaning
in life, physical health, life satisfaction, depression, personality, existential regrets, attitudes toward aging, and attitudes toward
life. Cluster analysis of sources of meaning revealed four distinct meaning orientations: self-transcendent (n = 32), collectivistic
(n = 24), individualistic (n = 34), and self-preoccupied (n = 30). MANCOVA analysis of the four groups, controlling for age,
marital status, education, and financial satisfaction, revealed a strong multivariate main effect for meaning orientation. No
statistically significant gender and Gender × Meaning orientation interaction effects were found. Older adults, who derive
meaning from self-transcendent sources, are more extraverted, open to experience, agreeable, and conscientious; perceive
greater purpose and coherence in life; feel more in control in directing their lives; express a stronger desire to get more
out of life; and are less depressed compared with those who derive meaning through pursuing self-serving interests without
any real commitment to personal, interpersonal, or societal development. The implications of the findings for positive aging
are discussed.

In recent years, there has been increasing research activity in
the study of personal meaning across the life span (e.g., Reker
& Chamberlain, 2000; Wong & Fry, 1998). Personal meaning
is defined as the cognizance of order, coherence, and purpose
in one's existence, the pursuit and attainment of worthwhile
goals, and the accompanying sense of fulfillment (Reker &
Wong, 1988). A person high on personal meaning has a clear
life purpose and a sense of direction, strives for goals consis-
tent with life purpose, feels satisfied with past achievements,
and is determined to make the future meaningful. A relatively
large number of empirical studies have clearly demonstrated
that meaning in life is an important variable in the buffering
of stress and the enhancement of physical, psychological,
and mental well-being (e.g., Fry, 2000, 2001; Newcomb &
Harlow, 1986; Reker, 1994; Reker, Peacock & Wong, 1987;
Vickberg, Bovbjerg, DuHamel, Currie, & Redd, 2000; Zika &
Chamberlain, 1992).
The main focus of prior studies has been on personal mean-
ing as a "global" construct, defined as the existential belief
that life has purpose and coherence. Reker and Wong (1988)
postulate that a full understanding of personal meaning requires
both a top-down (holistic) and a bottom-up (elemental) view
of life. It is not meaningful to talk about life as a whole as
having meaning; life only contains meanings that are actualized
through specific activities, quests, and goals. However, to achi
eve an enduring type of personal meaning, specific sources
need to be integrated into a larger and higher purpose.
Several researchers have observed that individuals extract
meaning from a variety of sources, including leisure activi-
ties, meeting basic needs, creative activities, personal rela-
tionships, personal achievements, personal growth, religious
activities, social and political causes, altruism, enduring val-
ues and ideals, traditions and culture, and leaving a legacy
(DeVogler-Ebersole & Ebersole, 1985; Kaufman, 1987;
O'Connor & Chamberlain, 1996; Prager, Savaya, & Bar-Tur,
2000; Reker, 1988, 1996; Reker & Wong, 1988). The mean-
ingfulness of these sources can be assessed by the Sources of
Meaning Profile (SOMP) developed by Reker (1991). Stud-
ies using the SOMP measure have shown that the sources
from which individuals derive a sense of meaning varies with
age group, gender, and ethnic identity (Bar-Tur, Savaya, &
Prager, 2001; Prager, 1996; Prager et al., 2000; Reker, 1988).

Even within a specified group, there are many different path-
ways to experience life as meaningful. Several of these indi-
vidual sources of meaning are associated with global meaning
and with psychological and physical well-being (Reker, 1988,
1994). Indeed, Reker (1994) found that having a large net-
work of meaningful sources (high breadth vs. low breadth)
culminated in a heightened sense of meaning fulfillment and
greater subjective well-being in older adults. These findings
suggest that individuals develop personal meaning orienta-
tions that individually and collectively contribute to positive
psychosocial functioning. Relatively little is known about
the content and the function of sources of meaning and the
meaning system that older individuals create for themselves.
Furthermore, the literature has not addressed the differential
impact that meaning orientations may have on both positive
and negative indicators of psychosocial adaptation.
Conceptual Framework
for the Current Study
Based on Frankl's (1959) conviction that the full meaning of
life can only be achieved by transcending self-interests and
on Rokeach's (1973) hierarchy of values in which certain
values hold greater significance than others, Reker and Wong
(1988) proposed a model of sources of personal meaning
consisting of four levels: self-preoccupation with hedonistic
pleasure and comfort (self-preoccupation), devotion of time
and energy to the realization of personal potential (individu-
alism), service to others and commitment to a larger societal
or political cause (collectivism), and entertaining values that
transcend individuals and encompass cosmic meaning and
ultimate purpose (self-transcendence). The levels describe
qualitatively different personal meaning orientations that
are postulated to differ in terms of depth of meaning that is
obtained. Individuals who find meaning through self-interests
are at the shallow end, whereas those who find meaning through
helping others, preserving values and ideals, and spirituality
are at the deep end. The implication of such a hierarchical
structure is that individuals will be able to integrate the con-
tradictions, conflicts, and absurdities of life by rising above
them and viewing them in the context of more comprehensive
horizons.
The ability of aging individuals to transcend life experi-
ences is postulated to impact positively on psychosocial out-
comes. Psychosocial adaptation is defined as the process of
putting oneself in harmony with the changing circumstances
of life so as to enhance one's sense of well-being and long-
term survivorship. Psychosocial adaptation is achieved through
the processes of assimilation (incorporating new information
into existing structures) and accommodation (changing
existing structures to accommodate new information), invo
lving the psychological (e.g., changes in perception, attitude,
behavior, and motivation) and social (e.g., change in one's
social environment) domains. Outcome indicators of effective
psychosocial adaptation include, but are not limited to, the
maintenance of good physical health, life satisfaction, good
mental health, positive life-and-death attitudes, high meaning
and purpose in life, and a stable personality.
Underrepresented in prior research with older adults are
psychosocial variables that focus on existential needs and
"ultimate concerns" with the givens of existence such as one's
mortality, feelings of isolation, and meaninglessness. Unmet
needs can lead to "existential distress." Existential distress
refers to negative thoughts and feelings of "angst" or anxiety
that arise from facing uncertain experiences such as fear of
aging, fear of death, and regrets in life. To the author's knowl-
edge, no study has been conducted that examines the relation-
ship between personal meaning orientations and existential
distress.
The conceptual framework for the current study is pre-
mised on the conviction that, from a psychological perspec-
tive, the aging process is marked by continuous growth and
development. The aging individual plays an active, vital role
in this process by taking advantage of personal resources to
actualize the human potential. Moreover, the positive psycho
logy movement in psychology (Seligman, Steen, Park, &
Peterson, 2005) and the strengths perspective (Lewis, 1996;
Saleebey, 1992) in gerontological social work emphasizes,
recognizes, respects, and appreciates the client's voice, exp
eriences, and personal knowledge about their own situations.
By focusing on the skills, knowledge, and residual strengths
of older persons, much can be learned about how individuals
successfully cope with adversity and the ever-changing cir-
cumstances in their lives.
The Current Study
The purpose of this study was to explore the personal mean-
ing orientations of older adults and to assess the association
of meaning orientations to measures of life attitudes, physi-
cal health, subjective well-being, personality, and existential
distress. Based on Frankl's (1959) and Tornstam's (1997)
theoretical position that self-transcendence is the key to the
discovery of deeper meaning and increased life satisfaction,
the following general hypotheses were formulated:
Hypothesis 1: The personal meaning system of older
adults will be characterized by four distinct patterns
that primarily reflect the transcendent, collectivistic,
individualistic, and self-preoccupied orientations.
This hypothesis is based on the theoretical specu-
lation proposed by Reker and Wong (1988) and
subsequently supported by empirical investiga-
tions of sources of meaning in life among young,
middle-aged, and older Canadian elderly (Reker,
1991), the Dutch elderly (Van Ranst & Marcoen,
2000), older Arabs and Jews (Prager et al., 2000),
adolescents living in Slovakia (Halama, 2000),
and middle-aged adults living in New Zealand
(O'Connor & Chamberlain, 1996).

Hypothesis 2: Older individuals, who derive meaning
from sources that transcend the self, will show sig-
nificantly better psychosocial adaptation in terms of
greater physical health, increased life satisfaction,
higher meaning and purpose in life, lower depression,
greater perception of choice and control in directing
one's life, a stronger desire to get more out of life,
and higher scores on the global personality traits of
extraversion, openness to experience, agreeable-
ness, and conscientiousness compared with older
individuals who find meaning through self-serving
ideals and values. This hypothesis is predicated on
a number of research findings showing that a belief
system based on transcendent meaning is positively
correlated with greater purpose in life (Bolt, 1975;
Crandall & Rasmussen, 1975; Reker, 1992), lower
depression (Reker, 1991), the use of constructive
coping strategies (Halama, 2000), and better adap-
tive coping with the problems of aging (Van Ranst
& Marcoen, 2000). In addition, based on the theo-
retical formulations of Erikson (1963), Maslow
(1968), and Tornstam (1997), it seems reasonable
to expect that self-transcendent older adults will be
characterized by positive, stable, and adaptive per-
sonality characteristics.
Hypothesis 3: Older individuals, who derive meaning
from sources that transcend the self, will show sig-
nificantly reduced existential distress in terms of
less fear of aging, fewer existential regrets, lower
existential vacuum, and less fear of death (i.e.,
greater death acceptance) compared with those who
are preoccupied with the maintenance and achieve-
ment of self-serving values. This hypothesis is
predicated on the assumption that self-transcendent
older adults are better able to put negative thoughts
and feelings about existential issues into perspec-
tive more easily and therefore, will not be as distressed
by them.
In sum, prior research on the link between personal meaning
orientations and psychosocial adaptation has been limited to
a fairly narrow range of outcome variables. The evidence to
date suggests that individuals of all ages who derive meaning
from sources that go beyond meeting self-serving and indi
vidual needs also experience more meaningful lives, hold
more positive attitudes, are more satisfied, and use more
adaptive coping strategies.
Method
Participants
Participants in this study were 120 community-residing older
adults (62 women and 58 men) aged 52 to 93 years (M = 73.6
years). The majority of the participants were married (62%),
26% were widowed, 10% were divorced or separated, and
2% were never married. In terms of educational level, 5%
had achieved only the eighth grade, 62% had high school and
community-college education, 27% achieved a university-
level education, and 6% had postuniversity education. Reg
arding satisfaction with financial status, 33% reported being
very to extremely satisfied, 58% were satisfied, and only 9%
were dissatisfied.
The participants were recruited through various civic and
social organizations, word of mouth, churches, retirement
residences, and agencies serving older adults in central Ontario.
Packets containing a consent form and a counterbalanced set
of questionnaires were distributed to the participants who
completed them at home and returned them in prepaid enve-
lopes (for a small number of participants, a research assistant
retrieved the completed forms). Average time for completion
of each packet was about 1.5 hr. A $100.00 draw prize was
offered as an incentive to take part in the study. Of the 136
surveys distributed, 122 were returned (89.7% response
rate); incomplete questionnaires for two cases res
ulted in
usable data from 120 adults. Approximately 10 months follow-
ing data collection, participants, who had requested feedback
on the study, were mailed a summary report of the findings.
Measures
Personal meaning orientations were assessed using the
17-item SOMP­Revised (SOMP-R; Reker, 1996). Sources
of meaning include meeting basic needs, participating in lei-
sure activities, taking part in creative activities, engaging in
personal relationships with family and/or friends, being ack
nowledged for personal achievements, experiencing personal
growth, taking part in religious activities, interest in social
causes, being of service to others, preserving human values
and ideals, preservation of culture and tradition, leaving a
legacy for the next generation, feeling financially secure,
interest in human rights, participation in hedonistic activities,
acquiring material possessions, and relationship with nature.
Respondents rate how meaningful each source is at the pres-
ent time in their life on a 7-point scale (1 = not at all mean-
ingful, 7 = extremely meaningful). The alpha coefficients
reported in several studies conducted in Canada, Australia,
and Israel range from .71 to .80, with a median of .77. The
alpha coefficient for the current sample of older adults was
found to be .84.
Physical health status was measured by a single-item
5-point scale with ratings of 1 (poor), 2 (fair), 3 (good), 4 (very
good), or 5 (excellent).
Life satisfaction was measured by the 13-item Life Satis-
faction Index­Z (LSI-Z), a modified version of the original
LSI developed by Neugarten, Havighurst, and Tobin (1961).
Ratings are on a 3-point scale (agree, disagree, ?). Scores can
range from 13 to 39. High scorers take pleasure from activity
in everyday life, feel satisfied with life, have a positive
self-image, and maintain happy and optimistic moods and
4 SAGE Open
attitudes. For the current sample of older adults, the alpha
coefficient was found to be .69.
Depression was assessed by the Zung Self-Rating Depres-
sion Scale (SDS; Zung, 1965). The Zung SDS is a 20-item
measure of somatic, psychological, psychomotor, and mood
areas. Ratings are on a 4-point scale (1 = none or little of the
time, 4 = most or all of the time). Scores can range from
20 to 80; a high score reveals greater depression. Alpha coef-
ficients of .77 and .81 have been reported for community and
institutionalized elderly, respectively (Reker, 1997). For the
current sample, the alpha coefficient was found to be .75. In
terms of validity, the Zung SDS correlates well with other
measures of depression.
Personality was assessed by the extraversion, neuroticism,
openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness
dimensions of the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI)
developed by Costa and McCrae (1985). Respondents rate
each of the 60 items on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly
disagree, 5 = strongly agree). A high score on each dimen-
sion reflects greater neuroticism, extraversion, openness to
experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Costa and
McCrae (1989) report internal consistency reliability ranging
from .68 (agreeableness) to .86 (neuroticism). The NEO-FFI
possesses satisfactory psychometric properties and cor
res
ponds well with the full 181-item scale (Costa & McCrae,
1988, 1989).
Existential regret in life was measured by the 20-item Exis-
tential Regret Scale (ERS) developed by Reker and Parker
(1999). Existential regret is defined as an inner experience of
discomfort, a brooding over lost opportunities, of not having
fulfilled one's potential, of having "unfinished business,"
and of not having respected the natural and global environ-
ment. The inner urgings reflect the need to take responsibility
to actualize one's potential and therefore demands attention.
Existential regret primarily taps into regret over having failed
to act (omission) rather than having committed an act (com-
mission) over which one feels guilty. An example item is,
"Missedopportunitieshavehauntedmeallmylife,"responded
to on a 7-point Likert-type scale (strongly agree, strongly
disagree). Scores can range from 20 to 140. Higher scores
reflect greater intensity of existential regrets in life. The
alpha coefficient was found to be .92 for a sample of univer-
sity students. For the current sample of older adults, the alpha
coefficient was .89. In a study of 110 young and middle-aged
adults, existential regret correlated positively with existen-
tial frustration (r = .65) and negatively with Ryff's (1989)
measure of integrity (r = ­.70) and the conscientiousness
dimension of the NEO-FFI (r = ­.40; Reker & Parker, 1999).
Fear of aging was measured by the 16-item 7-point Likert-
type scale of General Attitudes Toward Aging (GATA) deve
loped by the primary author. GATA measures fear of aging in
terms of mobility restrictions, declining future, fear of being
ignored, fear of isolation, financial constraints, and a general
fear of the aging process itself. Example items are, "I feel
that I have less to look forward to in the future than I did in
the past" and "As I grow older, I have a fear that I may be
alone and shut in from the world." Scores can range from 16
to 112. Higher scores reflect a greater fear of aging. For the
current sample of older adults, the alpha coefficient was found
to be .87. In a study of 66 older adults, fear of aging was
positively correlated with depression (r = .45) and regret
(r = .35) and negatively correlated with life satisfaction
(r = ­.43) and integrity (r = ­.59).
Attitudes toward life was measured by the Life Attitude
Profile­Revised (LAP-R; Reker, 1992), a 48-item, 7-point
Likert-type scale consisting of six factorially derived dimen-
sions: purpose, coherence, choice/responsibleness, death
accep
tance, existential vacuum, and goal seeking. Purpose
refers to having life goals and a sense of direction from the
past, in the present, and toward the future. Coherence refers
to having a sense of order, a reason for existence, and a clear
sense of personal identity. Choice/responsibleness refers
to the degree to which a person perceives to have personal
agency in directing his or her life. Death acceptance refers to
the absence of fear and anxiety about death and the accep-
tance of death as a natural aspect of life. Existential vacuum
refers to an absence of meaning in life, boredom, apathy, or
feelings of indifference. Goal seeking concerns the desire to
get away from the routine of life and to search for new expe-
riences and challenges and an eagerness to get more out of
life. Scores on each dimension can range from 8 to 56; a high
total score reflects a high degree of the attribute being mea-
sured. Indices of internal consistency are generally satisfac-
tory, ranging from an alpha of .77 to an alpha of .87. Short-term
test­retest reliability at a 4- to 6-week interval ranges from
.77 to .87. Validation studies involving a number of instru-
ments measuring identical and related constructs show good
convergence for all LAP-R dimensions (Reker, 1992).
Data Analyses
For 14 participants, some questionnaire items contained missing
data. In these instances, the mean value of the item was substi-
tuted. Preliminary analyses were conducted to examine the data
for violations of univariate and multivariate homo
geneity of
variance assumptions. The assumptions were met for all psycho-
social variables except for the personality trait of neuroticism.
The data were analyzed using a 2 (sex) × 4 (meaning ori-
entation) between-participants MANCOVA. The demographic
variables of age, education level, marital status (married vs.
not married), and financial satisfaction served as the covari-
ates in the analysis as these showed significant associations
with some of the major psychosocial variables (see Table 1).
The four levels of meaning orientations were determined by
K-means cluster analysis performed on the SOMP-R measure,
using the cluster analysis module of the Statistica software
program (StatSoft, 1995). All significant univariate main
and interaction effects of sex and meaning orientation were
Reker 5
further assessed using the Least Significant Difference
(LSD) post hoc testing procedures.
Results
Cluster Analysis
As a test of Hypothesis 1, cluster analysis performed on the
SOMP-R Scale revealed four distinct groups. Results are
graphically presented in Figure 1. Cluster 1 (self-transcendent
meaning orientation) consisted of 32 individuals oriented
toward transcendent sources of meaning, such as engaging in
religious activities, preserving human values and ideals,
leaving a legacy for the next generation, interest in humanis-
tic concerns, and relationship with nature. Cluster 2 (collec-
tivistic meaning orientation) comprised 24 individuals who
found meaning in personal relationships, service to others, and
commitment toward larger societal/political causes. Cluster 3
(individualistic meaning orientation) consisted of 34 indi-
viduals who found meaning through devotion of time and
energy to realize their personal potential such as taking part
in creative activities, experiencing personal growth, and tak-
ing part in religious activities. Cluster 4 (self-preoccupied
meaning orientation) identified 30 individuals who were pri-
marily oriented toward finding meaning through pursuing
self-serving interests, such as engaging in hedonistic activities
and obtaining material possessions, without any real commit-
ment to personal development, interpersonal relationships,
or social causes. These meaning-orientation clusters formed
the four levels of the independent variable.
Bivariate Correlation Analyses
The results of the bivariate correlation analyses are shown in
Table 1. As can be seen, the demographic variables are sig-
nificantly, but moderately, related to some of the major psy-
chosocial variables. Consequently, the demographic variables
are treated as covariates to control for their association with
the psychosocial variables. The correlational analyses indicate
that the psychosocial variables constitute a set of relatively
independent measures and support the contention that multi-
collinearity in the data is not a concern.

Multivariate Analysis of Covariance
Hypotheses 2 and 3 were tested using the MANCOVA mod-
ule of the Statistica software program (StatSoft, 1995). With
the use of Wilks's criterion, the combined psychosocial vari-
ables were significantly related to the combined covariates,
Wilks's l = 0.272, p < .001. Subsequent multiple regression
analyses of each psychosocial variable with the covariates as
multiple predictors showed that age provided a significant
adjustment for goal seeking (p < .05), marital status provided
a significant adjustment for purpose and goal seeking (p <
.05), education level provided a significant adjustment for
openness to experiences (p < .001), and financial satisfaction
provided a significant adjustment for life satisfaction (p < .001),
physical health (p < .01), fear of aging (p < .05), existential
regret (p < .001), existential vacuum (p < .01), and goal seek-
ing (p < .001).
The covariate adjusted means of the psychosocial vari-
ables are presented in Table 2. MANCOVA analysis revealed
a significant multivariate main effect for meaning orienta-
tions, Wilks's l = 0.33, p < .001. No statistically significant
multivariate main effect was found for gender, Wilks's l =
0.78, p = .073, or the Gender × Meaning orientation interac-
tion, Wilks's l = .54, p = .081. A test of univariate effects of
meaning orientations found statistically significant differences
on physical health, F(3, 108) = 2.91, p < .05; depression,

were found for life satisfaction, existential regret, fear of aging,
death acceptance, existential vacuum, and neuroticism.
Subsequent post hoc comparisons of the significant uni-
variate effects (see Table 2) showed that individuals with a
transcendent meaning orientation were significantly less dep
ressed, experienced greater purpose, experienced a greater
sense of coherence, perceived greater choice and a sense of
responsibleness, were more active in goal pursuits, and exhi
bited positive personality traits such as being more outgoing,
more open to experience, more agreeable, and more consci-
entious compared with individuals who found meaning in
sources reflecting self-serving interests. No significant dif-
ference between the transcendent (M = 3.6) and the self-
preoccupied (M = 3.5) meaning orientations was found for
self-rated physical health. When compared with the collec-
tivistic and the individualistic orientations, transcenders also
enjoyed better physical health, experienced greater purpose in
life, perceived greater choice and a sense of responsibleness,
were more active in goal pursuits, more outgoing, and more
open to experience. In turn, individuals with a collectivistic
orientation enjoyed better physical health, experienced greater
purpose and coherence in life, and were more conscientious
compared with those with a self-preoccupied orientation

(2 vs. 4). Individuals with an individualistic orientation exp
erienced greater purpose and coherence in life, were more
outgoing, and were more agreeable compared with those with
a self-preoccupied orientation (3 vs. 4). Finally, the adjusted
mean scores on the psychosocial variables for the collectivis-
tic and the individualistic meaning orientations fell between
the transcendent and the self-preoccupied orientations, but
only choice/responsibleness significantly differentiated the
collectivistic from the individualistic individuals, with the for-
mer perceiving greater choice in their lives and an increased
sense of responsibleness. In general, when all significant psy
chosocial variables are considered together, individuals with
a transcendent personal meaning orientation showed the best
adjustment in physical, psychological, social, and emotional
well-being domains whereas those with a self-preoccupied
orientation anchored the opposite end of the adjustment
continuum.
Discussion
The overall purpose of this study was to address two general
questions: "Are there different pathways to experience one's
life and aging as meaningful?" and "How do these pathways
relate to psychosocial adaptation?" In exploring the ways, we
focused on the identification of patterns of sources of per-
sonal meaning in older adults and attempted to extend earlier
research on young and middle-aged adults in whom four dis-
tinct meaning orientations were found. We then examined
the impact of these meaning orientations on both positive and
negative indicators of psychosocial adaptation.
Our results fully support Hypothesis 1. Cluster analysis of
sources of meaning identified four distinct groups of older
men and women who are distributed fairly equally across the
clusters: transcendent (27%), collectivism (20%), individu-
alism (28%), and self-preoccupied (25%). Consistent with
what one might expect in an individualistic North American
society, the individualism meaning orientation was found to
be most salient in this sample of older adults. However, per-
centage differences across meaning orientations were very
small. Thus, there is little evidence that one meaning orienta-
tion predominates over another. The personal meaning system
of older adults appears to be characterized by heterogeneity,
a finding also observed in the physical and cognitive domains
of human functioning. There are, indeed, a variety of different
pathways through which to experience one's life and aging
as meaningful.
Hypothesis 2 stated that transcenders would show better
adjustment on a number of positive psychosocial variables
compared with the self-preoccupied. The hypothesis was
supported for some but not all psychosocial variables. Tran-
scenders showed better adjustment in terms of lower depres-
sion, higher meaning and purpose in life, greater sense of
choice and control in directing one's life, and higher scores
on the global personality dimensions of extraversion, openness
to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Trans
cenders could not be differentiated from the self-preoccupied

on self-rated physical health, life satisfaction, and neuroti-
cism. Our results regarding life satisfaction and neuroticism
(i.e., anxiety facet) support the findings based on community-
residing older adults reported by Van Ranst and Marcoen
(2000). The finding that transcenders could not be differenti-
ated from the self-preoccupied on life satisfaction in the Van
Ranst and Marcoen study as well as the current study raises
doubts regarding Tornstam's (1997) postulate that gerotran-
scendence leads to increased life satisfaction. However, it is
possible that our measure of personal meaning orientations
reflect life goals and values that have been adopted and pur-
sued but not yet achieved by the respondents. According to
Frankl (1959), one way of finding meaning in life is through
committing oneself to something, be it nature, culture, or by
loving another human being. Therefore, a deeper sense of
commitment to values and the attainment of life goals may
be required before life satisfaction can ensue. Future longitu-
dinal studies that distinguish between sources of meaning
that have actually been achieved versus sources that have
only been endorsed might help to clarify this issue. Nonethe-
less, our findings suggest that adopting values that go beyond
self-interests is associated with a number of positive indices
of psychosocial adaptation.
Hypothesis 3, which focused on psychosocial variables
reflecting existential distress, was not supported. Transcend-
ers could not be significantly differentiated from the self-
preoccupied in terms of fear of aging, existential regret,
exis
tential vacuum, and fear of death (i.e., low death accep-
tance). In fact, none of the personal meaning orientations could
be differentiated from each other on the distress variables.
Two factors may have contributed to this finding. First, the
sample as a whole did not experience high levels of existen-
tial distress on any of the individual indicators as evidenced by
the absolute mean values relative to the maximum/minimum
scores possible. Second, although the differences were in the
predicted direction (existential regret being the exception),
greater variability on some psychosocial variables was noted
for some meaning orientations. Consequently, it is possible
that the combination of a higher functioning sample and dif-
ferential variability precluded finding significant differences
among meaning orientations on the distress measures. Thus,
before drawing any firm conclusions regarding the influence
of personal meaning orientations on existential distress, addi-
tional studies will need to be conducted on samples of older
adults who are confronted with more distressing life experi-
ences such as chronic illnesses, life-threatening health prob-
lems, and/or end-of-life decision making regarding treatment.
Limitations of the Study
Before considering the implications of our findings, a num-
ber of limitations should be addressed. First, our initial goal
was to demonstrate that different meaning orientations could
be reliably identified in a sample of older adults and differ-
entiated on a number of psychosocial variables. Although it
is tempting to speculate as to the direction of influence, the
cross-sectional design of this study does not permit us to deter
mine the causal relationships among the variables assessed.
A strong association between personal meaning orientations
and a number of positive psychosocial variables has been
demonstrated; however, it is not known whether having a
particular meaning orientation leads to better psychoso-
cial adaptation or whether good psychosocial adaptation
leads to the adoption of values that go beyond self-serving
needs. Second, the present study used a volunteer sample of
community-residing older adults characterized by above-
average functioning. Such individuals are expected to have a
coherent life structure and high goal achievement. Thus, it is
not clear whether our present findings would generalize to
the general population of community-residing elderly or to
those living in institutional environments. Finally, the present
results were achieved with a relatively small sample size and
are in need of replication and cross-validation.
In spite of these limitations, our findings have implications
for positive psychology and what is possible to achieve in the
later years (e.g., Reker, 2002; Ryff, 1989; Seligman et al.,
2005). Given the psychosocial variables investigated in this
study, it would appear that older men and women who "see
the bigger picture" by discovering and creating meaning
from sources that go beyond self-serving interests are char-
acterized by stable personalities and higher levels of psycho-
logical, social, and emotional well-being. The experience of
meaning at higher plateaus and broader horizons facilitates
transformation, the process of converting a given reality into
a new potentiality. Transformative processes can lead to a suc
cession of adaptations and the unlimited capacity to deal with
a variety of personal and situational circumstances. Through
transformation, the older individual is able to resolve the con-
tradictions, conflicts, and absurdities of life and create new
ways of being-in-the-world.
In conclusion, our focus on an older person's existential
belief system (i.e., personal meaning orientation) offers
an explanation as to why many older adults do not show a
decline in life satisfaction and purpose for living in the face
of difficult life situations. Although our society has done a
good job in providing for the physical, health, and mobility
needs of older adults, we have been slow to address their
existential needs through existentially based interventions,
such as meaning-making and spirituality, that offer a more
holistic and multifaceted approach. We hope that our
findings will lead to the implementation of programs for
community-residing as well as institutionalized older adults
that provide the structural supports and opportunities nec-
essary for engagement in self-transcendent behaviors with
the goal of strengthening the inner resilience of our aging
population.
