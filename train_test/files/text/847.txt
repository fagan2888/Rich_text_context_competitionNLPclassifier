Women's Caregiving and Paid Work:
Causal Relationships in Late Midlife

Department of Sociology, Indiana University, Bloomington.
Care of an ill or disabled family member orfriend is disproportionately done by women and typically is done in late
midlife. Because this is also a time in the life course when women's labor force participation peaks, many women
faced with caregiving demands have to decide how to balance them with their employment. In this study we use the
National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) of Mature Women to examine the causal relationship between employment
and caring for an ill or disabled friend or relative over a three-year period. We find that employment does not affect
whether or not women start caregiving, but that women who do start are more likely to reduce employment hours or
stop work. Thus, the causal relationship between employment and caregiving in late midlife is largely unidirec-
tional, with women reducing hours to meet caregiving demands.
DECISIONS about care of an ill or disabled friend or
family member often fall on the shoulders of working
women. Increases in the U.S. population aged 65 or older
and improvements in life expectancy have broadened the
demand for and incidence of caregiving (Coward, Home,
and Dwyer, 1992; Moen, Robison, and Fields, 1994). The
majority of this care is done by family members, and more
often than not by women (Coward, 1987; Dwyer and
Coward, 1992; Stone, Cafferata, and Sangl, 1987). Al-
though only a small percentage of women may be caregiv-
ing at any single point in time (Rosenthal, Matthews, and
Marshall, 1989; Spitze and Logan, 1990), recent estimates
indicate that over half of all women provide care for some-
one who is ill or disabled at some point in the life course
(Robison, Moen, and Dempster-McClain, 1995). Over the
course of the 20th century, more recent cohorts of women
have been more likely than earlier cohorts to be involved in
both caregiving and employment and, for many, caregiving
falls during the peak employment years of 35-64 (Moen,
Robison, and Fields, 1994). The timing suggests that, for
many, decisions about caregiving are closely entwined with
decisions about employment.
The primary focus of this study is on how caregiving and
employment affect one another. Previous research has fo-
cused on either side of the causal relationship, but has sel-
dom been able to examine how the two are interrelated.
One of the more frequent questions has been whether em-
ployment reduces one's ability to provide care for someone
who is ill or disabled or to provide other types of support.
This question is particularly important because if employ-
ment does reduce men's or women's ability to provide care,
it suggests that increases in labor force participation may
have broad implications for the care of the sick or elderly.
Answers have been inconsistent. Some early research sug-
gested that those who are employed provide less care
(Brody et al., 1987; Houser, Berkman, and Bardsley, 1985;
Lang and Brody, 1983), but more recent studies have found
few differences in the amount of care and support provided
employed versus nonemployed persons (Matthews, Werk-
ner, and Delaney, 1989; Moen, Robison, and Fields, 1994;
Spitze and Logan, 1991; Stone, Cafferata, and Sangl,
1987). However, there is evidence suggesting that employ-
ment may reduce one's ability to provide more extensive
types of care. For example, Ruhm (1996) found that mar-
ried persons who provide more than 10 hours of caregiving
per week are less likely to be employed than those who
provide no care, but that there are no such differences
among those providing fewer hours of care. Similarly,
Matthews and colleagues (1989) also found that for most
types of support, there were no differences in providing
care between employed and nonemployed sisters, but that
nonemployed sisters did provide more help for parents who
were in the worst health. Thus, employment status does ap-
pear to be related to more extensive levels of care, but it is
still not clear whether this is because nonemployed women
are more likely to provide care or because once care is
started, women stop employment.
Indeed, studies have also investigated whether caregiv-
ing affects employment. Estimates of the number of care-
givers who leave the labor force range from around 9 to 25
percent (Brody et al., 1987; Seccombe, 1992; Stone,
Cafferata, and Sangl, 1987). Women, particularly when
caring for elderly parents, are more likely to leave the labor
force than men (Stone, Cafferata, and Sangl, 1987). Studies
of workers suggest that nearly 10 percent consider quitting
work to meet caregiving needs (Gibeau and Anastas, 1989;
Scharlach and Boyd, 1989). Still another strategy is to re-
duce work hours. National data on caregivers suggest that
this may be slightly more common than dropping out of the
labor force, with 27 percent of employed caregivers reduc-
ing their work hours and 19 percent taking some time off
work without pay (Stone, Cafferata, and Sangl, 1987).
Given that resumption of full-time employment after an
exit for family reasons is related to lower wages (Wenk and
Rosenfeld, 1992), a greater likelihood of being located in a
benefit-poor job (Harrington Meyer and Pavalko, 1996),
and reduced retirement benefits (O'Rand and Henretta,
1982), any effects of caregiving on employment may have
S170
CAREGIVING AND PAID WORK S171
long-term consequences for women's income. In addition,
when caregiving is done in the years just prior to retirement
eligibility, labor force exits or reductions in hours may have
a particularly powerful effect on long-term income. In-
terruptions that occur when women are closer to retirement
may lower their Social Security or private pension benefits
(Kingston and O'Grady-LeShane, 1993). Furthermore, it is
not clear whether work interruptions that occur later in the
career essentially lead to early retirement because of diffi-
culties in returning to the labor force after caregiving re-
sponsibilities stop. Thus, even though the length of time
spent caregiving may be relatively short (Moen, Robison,
and Fields, 1994), it may be that women are unable to re-
cover their work hours.
Although most studies have either questioned whether
employment affects caregiving or caregiving affects em-
ployment, it is possible that both processes operate simulta-
neously. Decisions about whether one can provide care for
an ill or disabled friend or family member may depend on
their employment, particularly if the needed care is exten-
sive or if the job provides little flexibility for managing
these tasks. Once caregiving has started, some employees
are likely to adjust their schedules or stop work to meet
those demands. However, if the causal processes operate in
both directions, estimates that only consider one side of this
relationship will be biased and possibly misleading.
Observed differences in caregiving between employed and
nonemployed women may reflect that employed women are
less likely to start caregiving, or it may indicate that care-
givers reduce or stop employment. Because much of the ex-
isting research on employment and caregiving is based on
cross-sectional data, it has been impossible to assess both
sides of the relationship. In one of the few longitudinal
studies examining both processes, Moen and her colleagues
(1994) find some evidence that both processes do operate,
thus suggesting the need to further explore both processes
in conjunction with one another.
Our understanding of these causal processes is also lim-
ited because much of the prior research estimating this rela-
tionship is based on samples drawn from populations of
either workers or caregivers (see Horowitz, 1992, for a re-
view). Worker samples (e.g., Travelers Companies, 1985;
Scharlach and Boyd, 1989) can provide important detail on
how workers manage caregiving tasks, but they eliminate
anyone who leaves the labor force when they start caregiv-
ing. Estimates based on samples of caregivers (e.g., Brody,
1990; Stone, Cafferata, and Sangl, 1987) allow greater
comparison between those who are or are not employed,
but most are nonprobability samples. Thus, while many
studies provide suggestive evidence about how women
combine these two roles, select samples and cross-sectional
data have limited our ability to fully understand the causal
relationship between caregiving and employment.
A further complication in sorting out these causal rela-
tionships between caregiving and employment is the fact
that there are variations in women's employment. The na-
ture of women's employment varies, and a simple distinc-
tion between whether or not women are employed does not
capture differences in current work environment or prior
work history (Feldberg and Glenn, 1979; Spitze, 1988). For
example, Gerstel and Gallagher (1994) find that the type of
support provided varies by employment status and the de-
mands of the job. This raises the possibility that there may
not be a single causal process, but rather, that it varies de-
pending on one's type of job or even prior work history. To
explore this possibility further, we focus on several dimen-
sions of the work context, including prior work history,
economic vulnerability, job satisfaction, and proximity to
retirement.
A woman's prior work history may affect whether or not
she begins caregiving as well as whether she reduces or
stops employment if she does start caregiving. When faced
with decisions about caregiving, most women have a long
history of combining work and family demands. However,
the effects of this prior work context are not fully under-
stood. One possibility is that women who have previously
exited the labor force to meet family demands might be
more likely to take on caregiving tasks, but Robison and
her colleagues (1995) find the opposite effect. Among more
recent cohorts of women, they find that those with a contin-
uous work history were more likely to start caregiving. This
finding may have several possible explanations that have
not yet been explored. It may indicate that women with
prior interruptions in their work histories are less likely to
take on caregiving. Alternatively, it may be that women
who have had prior interruptions are also those who have
been at their job for a shorter period of time, and thus have
less flexibility to manage caregiving tasks. Thus, "work his-
tory" comprises many different factors, such as interrup-
tions specifically for family, time in one's current job, and
long-term work stability, and these may affect caregiving in
different ways. These components of a woman's work his-
tory may also affect whether or not women reduce hours
when they do start caregiving. Women who have prior exits
from the labor force for family reasons may be more likely
to do so again; however, those with less time in their cur-
rent job may also have the least flexibility to reduce hours.
Several characteristics related to a woman's current job
may also influence whether women start caregiving or re-
duce employment hours. Gerstel and Gallagher (1994) find
that income has little effect on whether or not different
types of care are provided, but among those who start care-
giving, those with higher wages may have greater flexibil-
ity to reduce hours. It may also be that the effects of income
depend on family income needs. If this is the case, we
would expect that, net of income level, women who have
difficulty making ends meet would be less likely to reduce
hours or stop work after starting caregiving. A third factor
that may affect whether or not women stop or reduce em-
ployment when caregiving are non-monetary benefits from
the job. Women who gain satisfaction from their jobs may
find that employment helps them manage the demands of
caregiving, and thus would be less likely to reduce work. In
contrast, those who are less satisfied with their jobs may
see caregiving demands as a good reason to leave an unre-
warding job. Finally, women's proximity to retirement may
also affect whether or not they reduce hours. Women who
are close to retirement or eligible for early retirement bene-
fits may find that caregiving prompts an earlier exit from
the labor force than was previously planned. Conversely,
S172 PAVALKO AND ARTIS
women who are closer to retirement may remain in the
labor force to increase future Social Security benefits.
While all of these components of the work context may
affect whether or not caregivers leave the labor force, they
may also shape the labor force movement of noncaregivers.
As women approach and move through their 60s they be-
come increasingly likely to retire, and exits from the labor
force for retirement may be confounded with exits for care-
giving. Especially when analyzing women of this age, it be-
comes important to explore whether the exit process among
caregivers differs from that among women of this age more
generally. Are caregivers more likely to exit the labor
force? Do factors affecting the exit process differ between
caregivers and noncaregivers? For example, we would ex-
pect that, in general, women who are less satisfied with
their jobs would be more likely to reduce employment
hours or stop work, but do women who start caregiving and
are dissatisfied with their work have even greater reduc-
tions than noncaregivers? If this process differs between
caregivers and noncaregivers, it may provide clues about
which aspects of work make combining caregiving and em-
ployment particularly compatible or difficult.
Our primary focus is to sort out the causal relationship
between employment and caregiving. We do this by analyz-
ing changes in both caregiving and employment over a
three-year period. Caregiving is defined broadly to allow
estimation of the general relationships between providing
any type of care to ill or disabled persons and employment.
It seems likely that the magnitude, and even direction, of
this causal relationship may vary by many factors such as
the type of care being given, the relationship between the
caregiver and care recipient, and the total hours of care nor-
mally given. However, in order to address this general rela-
tionship over time for both caregivers and noncaregivers,
we need to use a data set that includes longitudinal infor-
mation for both groups of women, and among the available
data sets of this type, none consistently include detail about
caregiving hours, care recipients, or type of care provided.
Understanding the general direction and magnitude of the
relationship between caregiving and employment is a first,
but critical, step that should provide an overview for re-
search that can explore the variations among more specific
types and levels of care. In this study caregivers are defined
as anyone who reports regularly giving care to ill or dis-
abled persons in the household or anyone who regularly
spends six or more hours per week caring for someone out-
side the household.
We begin our analyses by estimating the percentages of
women who report changes in employment and caregiving
status over a three-year period. What percentage of women
who start caregiving stop work? How does this compare to
women who do not start caregiving? Also, when women start
caregiving are they more likely to stop work or reduce
hours? These percentages are initially estimated separately
for caregiving inside and outside the home to explore
whether the relationships vary for these different caregiving
locations. After examining these percentages, we then esti-
mate multivariate models to disentangle the causal processes.
Although prior studies have been based on cross-sec-
tional data, they lead us to several hypotheses about multi-
variate relationships. First, particularly because our defini-
tion of caregiving stresses more extreme types of care
(caregiving inside the home or caregiving 6 or more hours
per week outside the home), we expect that employed
women will be less likely to start caregiving. Among
women who are initially employed, we also expect that
variations in current jobs or prior work history will help ex-
plain which women start caregiving. However, this part of
the analysis is more exploratory as we seek to better under-
stand which components of the job might affect women's
caregiving behaviors. A second hypothesis is that women
who start caregiving will have greater reductions in em-
ployment hours than other women. Once this general rela-
tionship is assessed, we will further explore whether any
personal or job characteristics increase the likelihood of
these reductions for caregivers.
METHODS
Data
Data from the 1984 and 1987 waves of the National
Longitudinal Survey of Mature Women (NLS) are used to
examine the relationship between employment and caregiv-
ing. The NLS is a nationally representative sample of over
5,000 women who were between 30 and 44 years old when
the sample was originally collected in 1967. African
American women were oversampled to allow meaningful
racial comparisons. Since the 1967 survey, the women have
been interviewed approximately every two years.
We use the 1984 and 1987 surveys because they contain
information on work status and on whether women are car-
ing for an ill or disabled friend or family member inside or
outside of their home. We were able to choose between a
three- or five-year interval because this information is also
available in the 1989 survey. A three-year interval is long
enough to allow us to observe some change in caregiving
status, but is also a short enough interval to minimize the
likelihood of multiple job changes or multiple caregiving
episodes. This later point is especially important because we
do not have information on each caregiving episode, but are
capturing caregiving status at two points in time. Estimates
over longer periods of time also make it nearly impossible
to link the context of any single job to caregiving changes.
Analyzing changes in employment and caregiving between
the 1984 and 1987 surveys is also preferable to the
1987-1989 interval because by 1989 a higher proportion of
the sample have retired or are closer to retirement, making
any exits for caregiving less distinguishable from retire-
ment. Additional analyses confirm this assumption -- the
relationship between employment and caregiving between
1987 and 1989 is consistent but weaker than that reported
for 1984 to 1987. This suggests that, as the sample ages,
work exits for caregiving become less distinct from exits
made by all women. While beyond the scope of this study,
these findings also suggest that the employment-caregiving
relationship may vary across the life course.
The NLS is an excellent data set for the analysis of the
caregiving/work relationship for several reasons. Data on
women's caregiving and work statuses at two time points
allow us to compare changes in caregiving for both em-
CAREGIVING AND PAID WORK S173
ployed and nonemployed women. The use of the 1984 and
1987 surveys is also important because it targets women
when they are in a critical time of the life course for both
caregiving and employment. In 1984, the NLS women
range from 47 to 61 years of age. This is a time when
women are most likely to become involved in caregiving
(Marks, 1993; Moen, Robison, and Fields, 1994) and also a
time when work interruptions are potentially costly for
postretirement income. Particularly for the older women in
this sample, the balance of employment and caregiving
may involve future expectations for retirement as well as
current demands and opportunities.
The NLS women also represent an important cohort of
women. Born in the 1920s and 1930s, these women estab-
lished their work and family lives during the 1950s and
1960s. Their lives span an era of significant social change
in expectations and opportunities for women to combine
work and family responsibilities. Many of their worklives
reflect this change, with interruptions or postponements of
paid employment until children were grown. By observing
these women when they are in their 50s and 60s, we can
observe how they combine work and family demands in
mid- and later life and assess whether previous ways of
combining work and family influence later decisions.
A total of 3,147 women (62% of the original sample) par-
ticipated in both the 1987 and 1984 waves of the NLS.
Attrition was slightly higher among Black women and
among those with less schooling. However, a detailed com-
parison between the 1982 survey and the Current Population
Survey (CPS) indicated that sample attrition has not sub-
stantially reduced the representativeness of the NLS (Shaw,
1986). She found that similar percentages of women in the
NLS and CPS had not completed high school. One discrep-
ancy between the two samples was between the proportions
of southern Black women, with the NLS including higher
proportions of Black women in the South (Shaw, 1986). We
have no reason to suspect that the greater representation of
southern Black women will dramatically alter the relation-
ship between employment and caregiving beyond the effects
of variables such as race that are included as controls.
Of the 3,147 women who remained in the 1984 and 1987
surveys, 3,083 respondents (95%) gave information on
caregiving and all independent variables. To explore the
impact of a variety of job characteristics on changes in
caregiving and job status, we also created a subsample of
women working in wage and salary jobs in 1984. Self-
employed women are excluded from these analyses be-
cause we lack the more specific information on their jobs
and job changes. Comparisons between wage and salary
and self-employed women show that percentages of women
who stop work and percentages that start caregiving be-
tween 1984 and 1987 are similar between the two groups of
workers. Of 1,423 women working in wage and salary jobs
in 1984, 1,389 (98%) cases contained complete information
on all independent variables.
Measures
Two dependent variables are used for our analyses. The
first is a dichotomous variable measuring whether women
are caregiving in 1987. We define caregivers as women
who report that they regularly provide care for an ill or dis-
abled person inside their home or that they regularly pro-
vide 6 or more hours of care per week outside of the home.
We do not define women providing 5 or fewer hours of care
outside the household as caregivers because this minimal
level of care could more easily be combined with employ-
ment. Survey questions do distinguish caregiving from nor-
mal childcare as well as from other household tasks, but ad-
ditional information on hours of care is only available for
caregiving outside the home.
Consistent with our broad measure of caregiving, a range
of people were care-recipients. Although we do not have
full information on care-recipients in both years (the 1987
survey does not ask about care-recipients for care outside
the home), the information we do have points to some gen-
eral patterns of care. The single largest category of care-re-
cipient inside the home was the respondent's husband. For
example, in 1984, 43 percent of recipients of care inside the
home were the respondent's spouse. The second most com-
mon recipient of care inside the home was the respondent's
child (23% in 1984), but care for one's child outside the
home was less common. The most common recipient of
care outside the home was the respondent's parents (45% in
1984), followed by 22 percent reporting providing care for
a grandchild. Among women reporting providing care out-
side the home in 1984, 18 percent reported providing care
to multiple persons. Data on care-recipients across the two
surveys also indicate that the distribution of care-recipients
does not change dramatically over this 3-year period.
Finally, for the subset of women who were caregiving in
both 1984 and 1987, available information suggests that
many were caring for the same person. Among women pro-
viding care inside the home in both surveys, 85 percent re-
ported the same relationship (e.g., spouse, parents) to the
care-recipient in both years.
Descriptive analyses separate caregiving inside and out-
side the home, but these two types of caregiving are later
combined into a single measure because the general pat-
terns are nearly identical. In later analyses of the effects of
caregiving on employment hours, we also checked to see
whether caregiving inside versus outside the home had dif-
ferent effects on hours reduction, but found no differences
between the two types of care. Thus, our analyses indicate
that the general patterns of the employment-caregiving re-
lationship are relatively similar for caregiving inside and
outside the home. An additional concern was that the ques-
tion for caregiving outside the household does not ask
whether their care is paid or unpaid. Although the question
does ask if the care is for a relative or friend, it is possible
that some women may report paid care. To investigate this
further, we compared the distribution of occupations among
caregivers and noncaregivers to see whether caregivers
were more likely to be in nursing or similar types of occu-
pations. We found that 15 percent of caregivers were in
nursing or institutional aid occupations while 12 percent of
noncaregivers were in these types of occupations. The simi-
larity of these distributions suggests that the incidence of
women reporting paid caregiving is likely to be very small.
This was further confirmed by reestimating all models but
excluding women in these occupations. In these models
S174 PAVALKO AND ARTIS
(not shown) the direction of all effects was unchanged, al-
though the magnitude of several significant coefficients was
slightly increased.
The second dependent variable is the number of hours
worked per week in the woman's current job. This measure
is based on a question asking women the usual hours they
work per week at their current job. Women not employed in
1987 were coded as working no hours. Estimating hours as
a continuous variable allows us to account for both reduc-
tions in hours and movements out of the labor force; this
may lead to misleading estimates, however, if a large num-
ber of women are out of the labor force and thus have
values of zero. To check for this, we also reestimated all
models of hours of employment with logistic regression,
narrowing our focus to only consider movements in and out
of the labor force. Given that most of the reductions in
hours observed among women over this time period actu-
ally involved exits from the labor force, we did not expect
substantial differences. Results from logistic regression
models of labor force status were nearly identical to those
from models of hours of employment.
Our analyses include four sets of independent variables
measured in 1984. The first group of variables, age, educa-
tion, race, marital status, health status, and number of de-
pendents in the household, are defined as control variables
and are included in all models. While several of these vari-
ables are likely to change in the interval, we are primarily
interested in how respondents' statuses in 1984 relate to
subsequent caregiving and work changes. The coding and
descriptive statistics for these variables are described in
Table 1. A second set of variables includes 1984 and 1987
caregiving status as defined in the previous section. The
third and fourth sets of variables measure specific charac-
teristics of women's employment and their employment
history. These variables are designed to further explore the
relationship between employment and caregiving for the
subset of women who were working in wage and salary
jobs in 1984. Employment characteristics include hours
worked per week in 1984, wages, economic vulnerability,
and job satisfaction. The measure of wages is logged.
Women who were missing information on wages were
given a value imputed from their education, occupation,
and job tenure. A separate dummy variable controlling for
cases with imputed values on the wage variable was not
significant and thus is not included in models shown.
Economic vulnerability is included to assess the importance
of the job for the family's economic survival. It is measured
by a question asking about the respondent's family's ability
to "make ends meet," with a value of 1 indicating that they
always have money left over, and a value of 4 indicating
that they are unable to make ends meet. Job satisfaction is
measured on a 4-point scale with higher values indicating
greater satisfaction with the job. Additional models includ-
ing occupational categories were also estimated, but there
were no significant differences between professionals, man-
agers, and other occupations. We did find that women in
craft, operative, or laborer occupations are slightly more
likely to start caregiving than other women, but this differ-
ence appears to be a function of the attributes of women
who are in these jobs (education, employment history, etc.)
and the characteristics of the job itself such as income.
Three variables capture different elements of women's
employment history. The proportion of years a woman has
worked between 1967 and 1982 provides a broad indicator
of employment history and thus allows us to contrast more
stable workers from intermittent or occasional labor force
participation. Job tenure measures the number of years a
woman has been in her current job, thus allowing us to sep-

arate the effects of length of employment in any single job
from more general patterns of labor force participation. A
dummy variable is also included to indicate whether or not
a woman has left any job since 1967 for family reasons so
that we can explore whether women who previously left a
job to meet family demands are more likely to also leave
for caregiving.
RESULTS
Table 2 overviews the bivariate relationship between em-
ployment and caregiving over the 3-year interval, separating
caregiving inside and outside the household. The most strik-
ing finding is the similarity between the two types of care-
giving. Of the 3,083 women in the sample, 4 percent
(n = 116) start caregiving inside the home between 1984 and
1987, and 6 percent (n = 184) start caregiving 6 or more
hours per week outside the home. Between 23 (inside) and
24 (outside) percent of women who start caregiving leave
the labor force during this time, and 4 percent reduce their
hours but remain employed. These numbers are especially
meaningful when compared to the top row of each panel,
which represents labor force changes among women who
did not report caregiving in either time period. While the
work hours of noncaregivers are somewhat more stable
(21% report no change in hours), 16 percent of noncare-
givers stopped work during this interval. This suggests that,
although caregivers are slightly more likely to stop working,
in general, many women in this sample are exiting the labor
force even without caregiving responsibilities.
This table also suggests a need to separate the role of
employment in selecting women into caregiving from the
effects of caregiving on employment. Forty-nine percent of
women who start caregiving inside the home are not em-
ployed at either survey compared to 41 percent of women
who are not caregiving. While not statistically significant,
this difference is large enough to suggest that, once other
factors are controlled, women may be more likely to take
on caregiving tasks if they are not employed.
The Effects of Employment on Caregiving
Table 3 shows a logistic regression model predicting care-
giving in 1987. Because of the similarity between the rela-
tionships of caregiving and employment inside and outside
the home and because of the small percentages of women
starting either type of care, they are combined into a single
caregiving measure. This model only includes women who
were not caregiving in 1984 so that we can examine factors
that differentiate those who start caregiving by 1987. The
first model shows that neither the demographic variables nor
employment status predict whether or not women start care-
giving. Women who are employed in 1984 are no less likely
to start caregiving than nonemployed women. We find a
similar pattern in the second model; among women em-
ployed in wage and salary jobs, those working more hours
are not less likely to start caregiving than part-time workers.
Both models indicate that women's employment does not
serve as a deterrent to taking on caregiving tasks. Indeed,
only one indicator, how long a woman has been at her cur-
rent job, is even a marginally significant predictor of care-
giving initiation. If we assume that women who have been
at their jobs for longer periods of time have greater flexibil-
ity because of more established relationships with their em-
ployer and co-workers, this effect may point to the impor-
tance of job flexibility for caregiving initiation. However,
the marginal level of significance indicates that this finding
would need to be explored in other samples before drawing
any definite conclusions about its effect.
Our inability to differentiate which women start caregiv-
ing may be due to the broad nature of our caregiving mea-
sure. To examine this possibility further, we examined the
initiation of more extensive caregiving. Our measure of care-
giving inside the home does not include information on
hours spent providing care, but the measure outside the home
does include this information. We thus compared women
who reported caregiving outside the home for 10 or more
hours a week to all others. Even for this more intensive level
of care, employed women were equally likely to start care-
giving as were nonemployed women (analyses not shown).

The Effects of Caregiving on Employment
Over the 3 years in our study, the general trend was for
women to reduce hours of employment. Among women
who were employed in wage and salary jobs in 1984, there
was an average decrease of 9.56 hours by 1987. Forty-three
percent of working women decreased hours, 40 percent re-
ported no change, and the remaining 18 percent increased
hours. As indicated from Table 2, the majority of women
who decreased hours of employment exited the labor force
entirely. Do women who start caregiving have greater re-
ductions than those who did not start caregiving? Overall
mean differences suggest that this might be the case.
Among employed women, caregivers reduced an average

of 13.5 hours while noncaregivers reduced an average of 9
hours (p < .05).
Table 4 estimates the extent to which caregiving changes
influence these reductions in hours net of other factors. The
dependent variable is hours worked per week in 1987, but
by controlling for 1984 work hours, we can interpret inde-
pendent variables in terms of their effect on change in hours
(Allison, 1990; Kessler and Greenberg, 1981). Because the
overall trend is a decrease in hours, positive coefficients in-
dicate a slower decrease in hours, while negative coeffi-
cients indicate a faster decrease in hours. Changes in care-
giving status are included as a series of dummy variables
that allow us to separately compare women who start, stop,
or are caregiving at both surveys from those who are not
caregiving at either time.
Both models in Table 4 show that women who started
caregiving after 1984 have significantly greater reductions
in hours than those who are not involved in caregiving.
Employed wage and salary women who are caregiving in
both 1984 and 1987 also have marginally greater reductions
in work hours than women who do no caregiving, but these
models indicate that the stronger effect of caregiving on
hours occurs at the onset of caregiving. Equally important
in these models is the finding that women who were care-
giving in 1984 but who had stopped by 1987 do not signifi-
cantly increase their working hours after they stop caregiv-
ing. This suggests that, at least among women in this age
group, reductions in hours or exits from the labor force are
not likely to be recovered after caregiving responsibilities
stop. Other variables in the model serve as controls and in-
fluence 1987 hours of employment in expected directions.
These results confirm that the initiation of caregiving is
associated with greater reductions in hours, but does this
pattern vary depending on the woman's job conditions or
other factors? For example, are women who are older, have
health problems, less satisfied with their jobs, or have pre-
viously interrupted work for family reasons more likely to
reduce hours when they start caregiving? Are women who
have more difficulty making ends meet more likely to re-

main in the labor force even if they start caregiving? An
equally important question is whether the exit process dif-
fers for caregivers and noncaregivers. Do the same factors
influence the rate of exit for both groups of women or are
there some factors that make caregivers particularly likely
or unlikely to leave the labor force?
Table 5 shows the effects of job variables on hours reduc-
tion separately for caregivers and noncaregivers. Since our
questions focus on the effects of the work context, models are
only estimated for the employed wage and salary subsample.
Comparisons between caregivers and noncaregivers allow us
to evaluate whether any factors associated with hours reduc-
tions among caregivers are different from what we would ex-
pect among women in this age group more generally.
The models in Table 5 show that factors influencing
women's reduction in hours are similar for caregivers and
noncaregivers. For example, employed caregivers who are
satisfied with their job have fewer reductions in hours than
those who are less satisfied with their job, but this is also
true for noncaregivers. Older women also tended to reduce
hours between 1984 and 1987, but older caregivers do not
have significantly greater reductions than older noncare-
givers. In additional models (not shown), we also explored
whether alternative specifications of age led to greater re-
ductions among caregivers, but neither proximity to retire-
ment age nor suggestion in 1984 of future plans to retire
were associated with greater reductions among caregivers. A
formal test of model differences, estimated by a single
model that included interaction effects for caregivers, also
indicates that the effects of independent variables on em-
ployment hours do not vary by caregiving status. These
findings suggest that, although caregivers are more likely to
reduce employment than noncaregivers, the processes af-
fecting work reductions are similar for the two groups.
The one exception to this finding is marital status. Un-

married women, whether caregiving or not, are more likely
than married women to remain fully employed. However,
this is even more true for women who start caregiving over
this interval (see also Ruhm, 1996). There are several possi-
ble interpretations of this finding. It may indicate that un-
married caregivers find particular benefits in employment
while caregiving (Scharlach and Boyd, 1989) or, alterna-
tively, it may reflect unusual constraints faced by unmarried
women if faced with caregiving demands. Unmarried
women are less likely to have alternative sources of health
insurance, income, and pension support and thus may be
less likely to reduce employment hours. Caregiving de-
mands may further exacerbate this process, possibly be-
cause they point to even greater needs for health insurance
or other sources of income security for oneself and the per-
son receiving care. Thus, an alternative explanation is that
unmarried caregivers have even fewer options than other
women for balancing caregiving and employment. These
findings thus suggest a particular need to understand how
unmarried women manage the balance between employ-
ment and caregiving and whether their greater likelihood to
remain in employment reflects restricted options or benefits
of employment for managing the demands of caregiving.
DISCUSSION
Recent estimates indicate that over half of U.S. women
may provide care for someone who is sick or disabled at
some point in their adult lives and that this care is most
likely to be done during the prime employment years in
these women's lives (Moen, Robison, and Fields, 1994).
Large percentages of women will thus be faced with deci-
sions about how to combine employment and caregiving,
but our understanding of how these two types of work af-
fect one another has been limited. This study seeks to pro-
vide a better understanding of the connections between em-
ployment and caregiving through an analysis of the
reciprocal relationships between them.
Our first hypothesis, that employed women would be less
likely to start caregiving, was not supported. Indeed, none
of the work or demographic characteristics was strongly as-
sociated with whether or not women started caregiving over
the 3-year interval. This suggests that caregiving initiation
is equally likely for all women, as neither employment nor
personal characteristics predict which women will start
caregiving.
However, once women do start caregiving, the ways they
manage those tasks can affect work. Our second hypothe-
sis, that women who start caregiving would be more likely
to reduce or stop employment, was supported. Equally im-
portant is our finding that women who stop caregiving dur-
ing this interval do not increase employment, thus suggest-
ing that, for women in late midlife, hours lost when
caregiving starts are not likely to be recovered later on.
Finally, although women who start caregiving are more
likely to reduce hours or exit the labor force, the work and
demographic characteristics that most strongly affect em-
ployment reductions are similar to those that affect
women's employment reductions more generally. Thus,
older caregivers and those less satisfied with their job are
more likely to reduce hours, but this is also true for non-
S178 PAVALKO AND ARTIS
caregivers. This suggests that the exit process among care-
givers is similar to that among noncaregivers, but occurs at
a more rapid pace. The one exception is our finding that un-
married caregivers are especially unlikely to reduce hours,
indicating the need to explore the potential benefits and re-
strictions faced by unmarried caregivers.
Our findings about the direction of the employment-care-
giving relationship are noteworthy because much of the prior
research has been based on cross-sectional data and has not
been able to separate the two sides of this relationship. The
use of cross-sectional data can easily lead to incorrect con-
clusions about the direction of the causal processes. For ex-
ample, if we use only the 1984 survey wave and estimate the
effects of employment in 1984 on caregiving in 1984, we
find that employed women are much less likely to be care-
giving (analyses not shown). An obvious conclusion might
be that employment reduces women's ability to take on care-
giving tasks. But, when we examine changes in caregiving
and employment over time, this is not the case. Instead, it is
after women start caregiving that they reduce work hours.
Although our attention to the effects of women's prior
work history was largely exploratory, it is notable that nei-
ther women's general work history nor prior exits for family
reasons influence whether or not women start caregiving or
whether they reduce hours after starting caregiving. This is
somewhat contrary to previous research (Robison, Moen,
and Dempster-McClain, 1995) that found that similar co-
horts of women with continuous work histories were more
likely to start caregiving. However, this earlier research also
found that the effect of prior work history varied by educa-
tion and birth cohort, but did not separate the effects of cur-
rent and prior work status. Further research exploring the
many aspects of women's current and prior work history is
needed to further understand how work processes relate to
caregiving as well as many other types of unpaid work.
Understanding the relationship between caregiving and
employment can inform linkages between state policies and
the life course. Observed trends in caregiving and employ-
ment are framed within a broader political debate that seeks
to move responsibility for care back to families, which in
reality usually means women (Gerstel and Gallagher, 1994;
Seccombe, 1992). This agenda is based in part on faulty as-
sumptions that "families" (e.g., women) are shirking re-
sponsibility for care in favor of employment outside the
home. Our research joins a growing body of research that
suggests that this is not the case. Employed women are not
less likely to start caregiving and "career" women -- those
with more stable work histories or those who did not previ-
ously interrupt their work to take care of family needs --
are no less likely to provide care than other women.
Instead, what our findings do suggest is that employed
women take on caregiving tasks at a potential cost to their
short- and long-term income. Caregiving is associated with
greater reductions in employment hours, and these hours
appear to not be recovered when women stop caregiving.
While this finding is only preliminary, given the proximity
of this cohort of women to retirement, it is potentially im-
portant. If later worklife exits for caregiving are not recov-
ered, then these reductions will translate into short-term
loss of wages but also potentially long-term reductions in
pension income. The pattern that emerges is not one of
women forgoing caregiving because of employment, but
rather, women squeezed as reductions in government pro-
grams and health insurance increase both their responsibil-
ity for providing care and their need for waged income
(Glazer, 1990). Further reductions in policies supporting
working families will only exacerbate those pressures.
Our findings on the causal processes relating employ-
ment and caregiving suggest several avenues for further
study. First, longitudinal analyses comparing caregiving ac-
tivities of men and women are needed if we are to fully un-
derstand the employment-caregiving relationship. This
study examines variations among women, in part because
women provide much of the care to ill or disabled persons.
However, research comparing caregiving between men and
women indicates that they may provide different types of
care (see Dwyer and Coward, 1992, for a review). It seems
plausible that the causal relationships between employment
and caregiving may differ for men and women, but it is not
clear whether any differences might stem from variation in
job conditions, work histories, or from other differences in
gender roles. Second, more detailed analyses of how spe-
cific types and levels of caregiving affect and are affected
by employment are also needed. For example, cross-sec-
tional research has shown that those providing more than
10 hours of care per week or those providing the most ex-
tensive types of care may be less likely to be employed
(Matthews, Werkner, and Delaney, 1989; Ruhm, 1996), but
it remains unclear whether the causal relationships differ or
are just more pronounced for higher levels of care. Thus,
we need to further examine whether these relationships
vary for different types and levels of care.
Finally, the relationship between caregiving and employ-
ment speaks to broader questions about how men and
women combine paid and unpaid work, how caregiving
compares to other types of unpaid work, and how these
types of work may shift across the life course. In many
ways, the work of caring for an ill or disabled friend or
family member is unique. Unlike childcare, caregiving may
last for a short period of time (see Moen, Robison, and
Fields, 1994). Particularly in the early stages, it is seldom
planned and may be prompted by a sudden and unexpected
change in someone's health. Also, unpaid work that arises
later in the life course, such as caregiving, may affect work
differently than unpaid work done earlier in the work ca-
reer. In other ways, caregiving may be similar to other
types of unpaid work, such as housework and childcare. All
of these types of unpaid work may conflict with paid em-
ployment, and often they require similar types of tasks
(feeding, cleaning, bathing, running errands). While we are
beginning to have a better understanding of each of these
types of work, we still know little about how all types of
unpaid work relate to one another, and their individual and
cumulative impact on paid employment.
