Known or knowing publics? Social
media data mining and the question
of public agency
Helen Kennedy1 and Giles Moss2
Abstract
New methods to analyse social media data provide a powerful way to know publics and capture what they say and do. At
the same time, access to these methods is uneven, with corporations and governments tending to have best access to
relevant data and analytics tools. Critics raise a number of concerns about the implications dominant uses of data mining
and analytics may have for the public: they result in less privacy, more surveillance and social discrimination, and they
provide new ways of controlling how publics come to be represented and so understood. In this paper, we consider if a
different relationship between the public and data mining might be established, one in which publics might be said to have
greater agency and reflexivity vis-a
`-vis data power. Drawing on growing calls for alternative data regimes and practices,
we argue that to enable this different relationship, data mining and analytics need to be democratised in three ways: they
should be subject to greater public supervision and regulation, available and accessible to all, and used to create not
simply known but reflexive, active and knowing publics. We therefore imagine conditions in which data mining is not just
used as a way to know publics, but can become a means for publics to know themselves.

Introduction
Social media data mining is on the rise. The increasing
availability of data on users and their online behaviour,
the decreasing cost of collecting, storing and processing
data, and the exponential expansion of social media
platforms from which much of this data is taken
mean that ­ at least in theory ­ an increasingly diverse
range of actors can mine social data. This process
can involve simply counting the likes and shares of
social media content, or more advanced analysis of its
strength, sentiment, passion, reach and other quantifi-
able characteristics (mentions, users, sources, hash-
tags). The metadata that sits behind social media
content is also widely mined, and considered by some
to be more valuable than the content itself. Such meta-
data includes: who is speaking and sharing, where they
are located, to whom they are linked, how influential
and active they are, what their previous activity pat-
terns look like and what this suggests about their
likely preferences and future activities. Social media
data mining is undertaken by the major platforms
themselves (like Facebook and Twitter), by intermedi-
ary commercial companies (such as Sysomos, Radian6,
Brandwatch), or with tools which are free to all comers;
some easy-to-use (for example Social Mention), and
others more complex (such as NodeXL).
Methods for analysing social media data promise
powerful new ways of knowing publics and
capturing what they say and do. And yet access to
these methods is uneven, with large corporations and
governments tending to have the best access to data
and analytics tools. Critics warn of a number of

troubling consequences for publics that result from the
rise and spread of data mining: less privacy, more sur-
veillance and social discrimination, and a new means of
controlling how publics come to be represented and so
understood. Meanwhile, the tools and systems that gen-
erate knowledge from social media data are typically
opaque and are rarely open to public scrutiny and
supervision. We argue that these various enactments
and characteristics of data mining are constitutive of
a new form of data power.
In the light of data power, this article considers
whether a more positive relationship between social
media data mining and public life might be established,
one in which publics can be said to have greater agency
and reflexivity. We argue that, in order for this to
happen, there is a need to democratise data power in
three main ways. First, to address concerns about the
potential negative effects of data mining on the public,
it needs to be subject to greater public supervision and
regulation. Secondly, to address the danger of new,
data-driven digital divides emerging, the technologies
of data mining (which include software and expertise
as well as data themselves) must be available and
accessible to the public so they can be used in varied
ways. Thirdly, given the contribution that data mining
increasingly makes to how publics and public issues are
represented, data mining could be used in ways that
enable members of the public to understand each
other, reflect on matters of shared concern, and
decide how to act collectively as publics, thereby allow-
ing publics to constitute themselves as more reflexive
and active agents.
Together, these three ways of democratising data
mining (subjecting it to greater public supervision and
control, ensuring it is available and accessible to the
public to use, and using it in a way that enables the
production of more reflexive and active publics) address
concerns expressed about data mining and point us
towards ways in which more knowing publics (rather
than just known publics) might surface through data
mining. They may, therefore, produce conditions in
which the public can act with greater agency in relation
to data mining, in the sense that Couldry (2014: 891)
has defined this term: `not brute acts (of clicking on this
button, pressing like to this post)' but rather `the longer
processes of action based on reflection, giving an
account of what one has done, even more basically,
making sense of the world so as to act within it'.
Baack (2015) argues that thinking about agency is fun-
damental to challenging the structures of data power
and yet questions about agency have been `obscured by
unnecessarily generalised readings' (Couldry and
Powell, 2014: 1) of the supposed power of technological
assemblages like data mining. For this reason, Couldry
and Powell (and others) call for more attention to
agency than theories of algorithmic power, or data
power, have thus far made possible. This paper repre-
sents one such endeavour.
Our paper is an imagining of the conditions that are
required to democratise data mining, grounded in
examples of the three strategies we discuss. As such,
our approach is normative, and is in line with those
grounded critical theories that seek both to analyse
problems with current social practices and articulate
what might be valuable about them (Young, 2002:
11­12). We are aware that despite growing calls to
think about and do data mining differently, efforts to
democratise data mining are far from being realised in
practice. Nonetheless, we feel it is important to do
the work of imagining what could be with regard to
the relationship between data mining and publics.
Given that, as van Dijck and Poell (2013) assert, all
kinds of actors (in education, health, politics, arts,
entertainment, policing, activism) are increasingly
required to act within what they define as `social
media logic' (which includes social media data
mining), imagining how such practices might be more
democratic seems like a vital undertaking. In doing this,
we revisit the question that Andrew Feenberg asked in
his preface to Transforming Technology: `must human
beings submit to the harsh logic of machinery, or can
technology be fundamentally redesigned to better serve
its creators?' (2002: v).
Although more and more data are mined from an
ever broader range of sources, we focus on social
media data mining here for three reasons. First, because
a wide range of public actors are technically able to
engage in it, as the open APIs (Application
Programme Interfaces) of social media platforms
make it possible for non-corporate actors to analyse at
least some public social media data. Second, while social
media have been viewed as sites of `interactivity' among
publics, social media data mining is categorically not
interactive: it takes data from social media and analyses
them, and publics are not able to intervene or interact in
this process. For this reason, the politics of social media
data mining need critical attention. Third, social media
have been viewed as crucial sites where publics emerge.
Described first as `networked publics' assembling in and
structured by social media platforms (Boyd, 2010) and
then as algorithmically generated `calculated publics'
(Gillespie, 2014), in this paper we consider whether it
is possible for the publics that take shape through data
mining to be characterised by agency and so be under-
stood as neither known nor calculated publics, but
rather as knowing publics. We proceed to elaborate on
some of the main criticisms that have been levelled at
social media data mining's production of known pub-
lics, in order then to consider the conditions under
which more knowing publics might emerge.
2 Big Data & Society
Known publics
The analysis of social media data is seen as a powerful
new way of knowing publics and capturing what they
say and do. But social media data mining and analytics
tend to be dominated by corporate and government
elites, who generally have the best access to data and
analytics tools. Critics warn of a number of problems
for the public that may stem from the growing data
power of these groups: it is likely to result in less priv-
acy and more surveillance, increased social discrimin-
ation and `deep personalisation' (Couldry and Turow,
2014: 1712), and it provides the already-powerful with
control over how networked publics come to be repre-
sented and understood.
The most common concern that arises from corpor-
ate and governmental uses of social media data mining
to know publics is that it results in less privacy and
more surveillance. In 2010, Facebook CEO Mark
Zuckerberg announced that in the age of social
media, privacy is no longer `a social norm' (Johnson,
2010). At the same time, a number of commentators
have contested this view, such as Boyd (2014), whose
extensive ethnographic research into teen social media
attitudes leads her to argue that privacy still matters to
young people. Contrary to Zuckerberg's assertion,
privacy still is a social norm, she and others claim.
Of course, it is in the interests of social media compa-
nies who make money by selling the content that users
share on social media platforms to tell us that we no
longer care about privacy ­ indeed, such strategies play
a role in shaping how we think. Yet despite the efforts
of Zuckerberg and others to dismiss the significance of
privacy in social media environments, the concept
retains traction. Examples of the invasion of social
media privacy by corporations are greeted by public
concern, and academic researchers seek to understand
what they call the `privacy paradox', or the fact that
social media users' sharing practices appear to contra-
dict their expressed privacy concerns. Some authors
conclude that for users, there is a distinction between
social privacy (controlling which people within
their networks get access to their information) and
institutional privacy (the mining of personal informa-
tion by social media platforms and other commercial
companies) (Raynes-Goldie, 2010; Young and
Quan-Haase, 2013).
Alongside concerns about personal privacy invasion,
social media data mining is seen as having increased
surveillance. Trottier (2012) argues that social media
data mining opens up access to aspects of life once
intimate and guarded and, as such, is a new form of
surveillance (see also Fuchs, 2014). Andrejevic provides
a convincing array of examples to argue that there are
various ways in which our actions are subjected to
surveillant scrutiny, including forms of social media
data mining like sentiment analysis and opinion
mining, but also other activities like body language
analysis, neuromarketing and drone technology
(2013). Social media platforms like Facebook are ide-
ally situated for ubiquitous surveillance, he argues with
Gates (Andrejevic and Gates, 2014), as they have the
infrastructure in place that makes it possible for them
to serve as surveillance systems. In a recent online list of
the 10 largest databases in the world, a number of social
media platforms figure (Anonyzious, 2012, cited in
Andrejevic and Gates, 2014: 189). Thus corporate and
governmental uses of social media data mining can be
seen as contemporary forms of surveillance, and plat-
forms are simultaneously actors in surveillant practices,
infrastructures that enable surveillance, and databases
which house the datasets that are surveilled.
With all of this mined data comes the possibility of
discriminating amongst members of the public, and a
number of scholars have pointed to the various
domains in which this discrimination is taking place.
Turow (2012) highlights how the digital advertising
industries use data to discriminate as, through data ana-
lytics processes, `individual profiles' are turned into
`individual evaluations' (p. 6). Based on behavioural
and other forms of tracking, individuals' marketing
value is calculated and each individual is categorised
as target or waste. Like Turow, others have highlighted
how the discriminatory potential of data mining is cap-
tured in the interests of capital. Hearn (2010) argues
that data mining's ability to identify valuable senti-
ments monetises feeling and intimacy and represents
yet another capitalist mechanism of value extraction,
and Andrejevic (2011) writes about the role sentiment
analysis plays in the prediction and control of affect.
Elsewhere, Beer and Burrows (2013) point to the ways
in which data-based discrimination operates in the pro-
duction of culture. Writing about music consumption
technologies and their generation of archivable data
about listening habits, they suggest that such data do
not only constitute listening practices, but also `feed
into the production of large-scale national geodemo-
graphic systems that in turn provide postcode-level ana-
lysis of people's tastes and preferences' (2013: 59). As
such, data constitutes much more than culture, serving
also to shape regimes of governance and control (see
also Barocas and Selbst, 2014).
Elsewhere, commentators have raised concerns
about the democratic implications of the `deep person-
alisation' that result from the discriminatory practices
discussed above (Couldry and Turow, 2014: 1712;
Kant, 2014; Pariser, 2011). Pariser (2011: 24) warns
that the resulting `filter bubble' of media content tai-
lored to individuals is a `centrifugal force' that separ-
ates members of the public from one other and weakens
Kennedy and Moss 3
democracy. Couldry and Turow (2014: 1716­1718)
describe how personalisation might shape the content
media organisations produce, as they adapt news
and other content based on the knowledge they have
about audiences. Deep personalisation of media, they
argue, threatens to undermine the `shared reference
points' necessary for democracy and which `enable us
to recognize one another as members of a common
social and political space' (Couldry and Turow, 2014:
1719).
At the same time, some commentators have argued
that data-mining techniques are used by dominant
groups as a powerful new way of controlling how pub-
lics are represented and so understood. In this respect,
if personalisation is a centrifugal force (Pariser, 2011:
24), data mining can act as a centripetal force in repre-
senting what broader publics are saying and doing.
While much knowledge generated through social
media data is not shared with the public, representa-
tions of the public based on social media data now
circulate in the public sphere and shape how publics
are viewed and how they see themselves (Anstead and
O'Loughlin, 2015; Gillespie, 2014). Discussing the UK
general election in 2010, Anstead and O'Loughlin
(2015: 215) note that `the use of social media as a
tool to understand and illustrate public opinion is start-
ing to enter into mainstream media discourse', through
`more complex semantic polling techniques' as well as
`electronic vox pops and commentary on trending
topics'. The public, they argue, `reflect on' `interpret
and talk about these forms of public opinion in their
everyday lives' (Anstead and O'Loughlin, 2015: 216).
Similarly, Gillespie (2014) discusses how representa-
tions of the public generated through data ­ what he
terms `calculated publics' ­ are becoming increasingly
prominent ways of thinking about publics. He gives the
example of Twitter's Trends algorithm, which claims to
represent what different geographical publics are dis-
cussing on Twitter at particular moments in time
(Gillespie, 2012). Gillespie (2014) argues that these rep-
resentations matter because they play a role in shaping
and constituting what we take publics to be. He therefore
urges us to ask, `how do these technologies, now not just
technologies of evaluation but of representation, help to
constitute and codify the publics they claim to measure,
publics that would not otherwise exist except that the
algorithm called them into existence?' (2014: 189). The
publics generated through data are contestable: they do
not simply mirror publics `out there', but rather are con-
structed in particular and partial ways. Given this,
Gillespie (2014: 189) suggests there is the possibility of a
`friction between the ``networked publics'' forged by users
and the ``calculated publics'' offered by algorithms'.
We argue below that the representational work data
mining can perform in representing broader publics ­
especially in view of the personalisation and fragmen-
tation of digital spaces ­ could be a valuable resource in
providing `shared reference points' that Couldry and
Turow (2014) argue are crucial for democracy.
The important question is to what extent data mining
is used to promote public reflection, understanding and
debate, and whether the representations it generates are
contestable. Gillespie (2014: 191) suggests that with
each public medium (now algorithms, previously, for
example, newspapers), we `turn over the provision of
knowledge to others' and so are `left vulnerable to their
choices, methods and subjectivities'. Sometimes this can
be positive, he argues, as it provides us with knowledge
filtered through editorial expertise, as in the case of
newspapers. But sometimes it is not, because filtering
and selection procedures are unavailable to us, or
because they have undesirable social and political con-
sequences. Algorithms are `socially constructed and
institutionally managed mechanisms for assuring
public acumen: a new knowledge logic', he writes
(Gillespie, 2014, 192). However, the criteria by which
calculated publics are generated are typically unknown
and not clearly explained (Gillespie, 2014).
The concentration of data power in elite hands and
the related unequal access to data and analytics tools
can make it difficult for publics to contest or challenge
the ways in which data mining plays a role in represent-
ing publics. Indeed, another concern expressed in rela-
tion to the rise of data mining, one of Boyd and
Crawford's (2012) six `provocations for Big Data,' is
that limited access to Big Data is creating new digital
divides. Boyd and Crawford (2012) point out that while
much of the enthusiasm surrounding Big Data comes
from a belief that they are easy and straightforward to
access, this is categorically not the case. So our state-
ment in the introduction, that it is technically possible
for a range of actors to engage in social media data
mining because of platforms' open APIs, requires the
important caveat that there are a number of challenges
to realising this possibility. At present, elite commercial
companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon have
the best access to data, as well as the best tools and
methods to make sense of it (Williamson, 2014). Some
companies restrict access to data entirely, others sell
access for a high fee, some offer small data sets to uni-
versity-based researchers. Thus those with money or
inside a company have differential access to social
media data from those without financial resources or
operating outside the major companies.
These data inequalities relate not only to data and
analytics tools, but also to the expertise needed to use
and make sense of them. Manovich states that there are
three ways of relating to Big Data: there are `those who
create data (both consciously and by leaving digital
footprints), those who have the means to collect it,
4 Big Data & Society
and those who have expertise to analyze it' (2011: 10).
Boyd and Crawford (2012) also point out that who is
deemed to have expertise determines both who controls
data-mining processes and the `knowledge' about
publics that results, knowledge which in turn produces
publics, as we suggest above. `Wrangling APIs, scrap-
ing, and analyzing big swathes of data is a skill set
generally restricted to those with a computational back-
ground' (2012: 674), they argue. So access to data-
mining expertise, as well as to data themselves, is
uneven, and this produces new digital divides in rela-
tion to access to data, tools, skills and expertise (Boyd
and Crawford, 2012).
The criticisms of social media data mining outlined
in this section point to problems with current dominant
uses of data mining. Critics argue that the imperative of
government and corporate elites to know publics in
particular ways through social media and other forms
of data mining leads to the erosion of personal privacy
and a parallel growth in practices of surveillance,
discrimination and elite control over the ways in
which publics are represented and known. These are
all valid concerns, but they leave us with the question
of whether it has to be so, or whether data mining may
be reimagined in ways that allow it to contribute more
positively to public life. In the next section, we describe
alternative ways of thinking and doing data mining that
seek to democratise data power and which suggest that
a different relationship between the public and data
mining may be possible. Our intervention, then, is to
suggest ways of moving beyond critique. We character-
ise the battle over data power as being about a move
from `known publics', who are subject to the data-
mining practices of powerful groups, to `knowing pub-
lics', who are more active and reflexive agents.
Knowing publics
We have described how data mining is used by corpor-
ations and governments to know publics and how these
practices raise concerns about privacy, surveillance,
social discrimination and control over how publics
are represented and understood. These problems are
exacerbated by the emergence of new digital divides
and inequalities around data. The critiques of data
mining we have discussed above do the important
job of highlighting some of the troubling consequences
of current forms of social media data mining. However,
they only take us so far: they do not tell us whether
alternative data practices and arrangements are pos-
sible and, if so, what they should look like. In this sec-
tion, we take critiques of data mining as a starting point
and ask: `given these problems, what then?' Looking
towards alternative ways of thinking about and doing
data mining that are emerging, we consider how data
mining may be reimagined in ways that allow it to
contribute more positively to public life.
Following the concerns expressed about social media
data mining, there have been growing calls to think
about and do data mining differently and so to democ-
ratise data. We highlight three main aspects to this pol-
itics of data mining, all of which seek to increase the
power of the public vis-a
` -vis current data-mining
regimes:
1. Data-mining practices should be subject to greater
public supervision and regulation.
2. Data mining (data, tools, and expertise) should be
accessible for all to use.
3. Data-mining practices should be used in ways that
help to make more reflexive and active publics.
The first two of these are already the subject of wide-
spread discussion, but the third is less widely discussed
in relation to data mining and analytics. Our contribu-
tion to this debate is to argue that all of these three
ways of democratising data mining are necessary to
address the problems of data power, because together,
they provide the means by which publics may be
empowered through data. Of course, these are not
straightforward solutions and are far from being imple-
mented in practice, but identifying and outlining them
is a necessary part of our project of imagining alterna-
tive and more democratic forms of social media data
mining.
Perhaps the most widely discussed way in which the
public can have more control over data mining is by
making data-mining practices more transparent.
Concerns about the negative social consequences of
data mining in terms of privacy, surveillance, social
discrimination, personalisation and control over how
the public are represented and exacerbated by the
black-boxing of data-mining processes: it is difficult to
evaluate data-mining practices because code, algo-
rithms and methodologies are often proprietary and
we do not always know how they work. Gillespie
(2014) highlights this problem when he talks about
the opacity of Twitter's Trend algorithm and digital
reputation measurement platforms like Klout. Given
this, commentators argue that data-mining techniques
need to be more transparent (Anstead and O'Loughlin,
2012; Couldry and Powell, 2014). Proponents of this
position argue that making data-mining algorithms
and processes public in this way would help to facilitate
public understanding, scrutiny and debate about the
political effects of data mining, and allow the public
and groups acting on the public's behalf to examine
and contest data-mining practices.
Some efforts to communicate transparently about
data-mining practice are starting to emerge, although
Kennedy and Moss 5
not necessarily on the major social media platforms.
The UK broadcaster Channel 4 attempted to commu-
nicate its uses of viewer data to viewers through the
production of a video featuring one of its comic talents,
Alan Carr, in which the comedian describes which data
the broadcaster asks its viewers to share voluntarily, the
uses to which they are put, and the benefits to viewers
(http://www.channel4.com/4viewers/). Similarly, the
dating website OK Cupid attempted to explain its algo-
rithmic matching processes in an animated video called
`the math of online dating' (https://www.youtube.com/
watch?v=m9PiPlRuy6E) and the site also regularly
unpacks the platform's own data on its blog (http://
blog.okcupid.com/).
However, some commentators argue that making
data mining transparent is not enough. Requiring com-
panies to show their algorithms does not mean they will
or are required to revise problematic practices, nor does
it necessarily lead to greater public understanding, given
the levels of expertise required to make sense of the tech-
nical operations of data-mining processes. What is
needed, then, is not transparency, but accountability,
some argue (Diakopoulos, 2014; MacKinnon, 2014;
Pasquale, 2015; Sandvig et al., 2014). As Couldry and
Powell (2014: 4) note, transparency goes some way
towards addressing the problems of data mining's opa-
city and black-boxing, but it still `fails to address
accountability and reflexivity'. In other words, transpar-
ent companies are not necessarily accountable. Here,
accountability might be understood in the terms in
which Giddens (1984: 30) defines it: `to be ``account-
able'' for one's activities is both to explicate the reasons
for them and supply normative grounds whereby they
can be ``justified'''. Drawing on Giddens' definition,
McQuail (2003: 15) writes that `we can view accountabil-
ity as the entire process (within a communication rela-
tionship) of making claims based on expectations and
appeals to norms, the response of the other party (reject-
ing claims or explaining actions), and any ensuing pro-
cedures for reconciling the two'. In the context of
democratising data mining, accountability would there-
fore mean requiring data-mining companies not just to
show the public what they are doing, but to tell publics
what they are doing, why, and with what effect. Such
accountability makes it possible to audit firms in a way
that transparency does not, and it is for these reasons
that proponents cited here argue for `algorithmic
accountability' rather than transparency.
Other commentators stress the need to regulate the
uses to which data mining is put in order to prevent
harm to the public (Barocas et al., 2013; Zarsky, 2004).
Self regulation by private companies is not likely to be
sufficient. To secure the public interest, as Freedman
(2012) argues in relation to the Internet and the
media industries more generally, regulation requires
the intervention of public authorities. But any govern-
ment regulation of data mining must itself be demo-
cratic and accountable to the public, not least because
of the use of data mining and analytics by governments
themselves. Government regulation imposed from the
top down, without input from the public, would not
guarantee that it serves the public and addresses
public concerns. The public needs to be involved in
determining how data mining will be regulated, if regu-
lation is to be legitimate and enjoy public support.
Examples which try to enact this proposal on a small
scale include the EU's Hack4Participation initiatives:
these hackathons explore how to get EU citizens
more involved in EU policy-making and how to
enable the better analysis of policy-making processes,
and they sometimes result in the development of
data-related policy. For example, policy relating to
Net Neutrality was developed at a German policy
hackathon and the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative
operates in this way, adopting a strategy not of lobby-
ing but of writing media policies which are relevant to
the current digital age (for example in relation to priv-
acy) (Hintz, 2014).
The second way to democratise data mining relates
to public access. Given concerns about the emergence
of a new digital divide around data, some commenta-
tors argue that if data mining is to serve the objectives
of the public, it needs to be accessible to the public, not
just major corporations, governments and security
agencies. One proposed solution to problems of
access which is relevant to our focus here is open
data. According to Bates (2013), open initiatives like
Open Government Data, Open Access and Free and
Open-Source Software can be understood as efforts to
reverse the trend towards the private ownership of and
differential access to data that results in the kinds of
known publics discussed above. Open data groups
lobby for access to and the ability to re-use datasets,
often focusing on those produced by public institutions.
They insist on access and re-use for everyone, `free of
charge, and without discrimination' (Bates, 2013: np).
Such groups see the opening up of public datasets as a
form of democratisation of data, allowing the access to
data that Boyd and Crawford argue is ominously
absent from the data delirium (van Zoonen, 2014).
But returning to the arguments of Manovich and
Boyd and Crawford, open data advocate Rae (2014)
argues that although the release of open datasets can
be for the public good, it needs to be accompanied by
skilled analysis and, importantly, by the right answers
to these three questions: opened by whom, open to
whom, and open to what? Open access to data is only
one step in overcoming the danger of data-driven
6 Big Data & Society
digital divides and in making data more accessible to
publics. Alone, it is not an unproblematic solution to
the problems of data mining discussed above. Indeed,
as Bates and others (for example Gurstein, 2011) point
out, there are many ways in which open data may
serve to empower the technologically-elite and
already-empowered ­ Bates' own study into open gov-
ernment data confirmed that governments usually
release open data under conditions that allow them to
control information flows.
It should be noted that these discussions are about
the democratisation of access to data produced by
public institutions, not to data mining, nor to social
media data. Couldry and others addressed the issue of
making data mining and analytics public ­ or social, in
their terms ­ on a project called Storycircle (http://
storycircle.co.uk/), which aimed to develop understand-
ing of how digital resources can support individual and
group agency in a specific social context (Couldry,
2014). One such resource is analytics. Couldry and col-
laborators developed the notion of `social analytics' to
describe their research into social actors' uses of ana-
lytics, what Couldry describes as `alternative projects of
self-knowledge, group knowledge, institutional know-
ledge ­ whose ends are not the tracking of data for its
own sake, or even for profit, but for broader social,
civic, cultural or political goals' (Couldry, 2014: 892;
see also http://storycircle.co.uk/resources/social-analy-
tics/). Social organisations' uses of analytics for these
`social, civic, cultural or political' purposes might be
seen as a concrete example of the democratisation not
just of data but of data mining.
Efforts to make social data open in the same ways as
other types of data raise issues of ethics and personal
privacy, discussed above, something which again
underscores the need for public debate about and regu-
lation of data mining. As Baack (2015) points out, open
data advocates believe that personal data (that is, data
which allows persons to be identified) should not be
made open in the same way as other data.
Nonetheless, some researchers have experimented with
opening up social media data, such as Pybus et al.
(forthcoming), who discuss their project `Our Data,
Ourselves' in this special issue. This project aimed to
confront questions of agency in relation to social media
data, given what the researchers saw as asymmetrical
power relationships with regard to who gets to own the
social data that we are all active in producing, and to
explore how gaining access to one's own social data
might augment agency. Aware that accessibility issues
relate not just to data but also to software and the
technical skills and expertise required to analyse data
(see also Boyd and Crawford, 2012, discussed above),
they worked with already-skilled young coders to create
apps to intervene in social data produced and mined on
mobile phones. Examples of apps created by the young
coders include one designed to highlight the frequency of
data tracking through audio alerts and another which
produced graphs demonstrating the relationship between
social media platform usage and frequency of data
mining. At the time of writing, the project is only
recently finished, so the results and findings have not
yet been widely shared, but it nonetheless represents a
concrete example of how social media data and their
mining might be made more accessible to publics.
The third way in which data mining might be demo-
cratised relates to the types of publics it produces and
the implications this has for the quality of the public
sphere (Barnett, 2003: 54­80, 2008; Habermas, 1997:
329­387) or `the mediapolis' (Silverstone, 2007).
As noted earlier, the representations of publics gener-
ated through data mining circulate in the public sphere
and constitute publics by shaping how publics come to
be viewed and understood (Anstead and O'Loughlin,
2015; Gillespie, 2014). In one respect, this is not new:
several democratic and media theorists have noted how
`the public' and `public opinion' are not things that can
be known without various technologies and practices of
representation that make them present (Barnett, 2008;
Osborne and Rose, 1999; Peters, 1995). As Barnett
(2008: 404) puts it, `people speak about what ``the
public'' thinks, feels, and favours, and when they do
so, they tend to have recourse to the results of elections,
or statistical surveys, or opinion polls. These technical
mediums are the ways in which the voice of the public is
often expressed'.
However, while publics depend upon various forms
of representation, not all ways of representing publics
are equal and the implications different representations
have for the quality of the public sphere vary signifi-
cantly. In his account of `the mediapolis', Silverstone
(2007: 29) stresses how media representations exclude
as well as include and stifle as well as promote public
understanding and debate. Yet, he argues that good
media are a crucial source of public reflexivity.
Media, he writes, `are not only the locus of reflexivity
in this, the late modern world, but they are one of its
key stimuli, and they themselves, at best, provide the
materials for that reflection and criticism' (Silverstone,
2007: 20). He therefore urges us to consider the `facul-
ties of judgement and imagination, and the capacity of
the mediapolis to provide, and enable, the resources for
the exercise of both in the pursuit of more effective
understanding and participation in the world'
(Silverstone, 2007: 43).
Data mining and analytics (and the representations
and visualisations of publics they generate) could pro-
vide an invaluable cognitive resource for members of
Kennedy and Moss 7
the public to understand each other, reflect on matters
of shared concern, and to decide how to act together as
publics. In this way, data mining and analytics could
help to provide `shared references points' for publics
that cut across the data-driven personalisation of digi-
tal space (Couldry and Turow, 2014). However, data
mining is more often viewed as a way of generating
knowledge about publics rather than for or with pub-
lics. To date, most attention has been focused on how
data mining can capture what publics say and do,
rather than how ­ as part of `the mediapolis'
(Silverstone, 2007) or public sphere ­ it can help mem-
bers of the public to understand public issues and each
other better, such that more informed and knowing
publics may take shape. But there are some exceptions.
We point below to examples where data mining has
been used to promote public understanding and
debate in ways that might enable the creation of more
active and knowing publics.
Good data journalism uses data mining (and,
relatedly, data visualisation) to promote public under-
standing of public issues. One example is the work done
by The Guardian newspaper, in collaboration with
academic researchers, on the Reading the Riots project,
which analysed data about the riots that took place in
the UK in the summer of 2011 (Vis, 2012). The project
aimed to identify why looting took place, in response to
the absence of a government enquiry into the causes of
the riots. Combining data about the location of riots
with deprivation data allowed the project team to ques-
tion the dominant narrative which asserted that there
was no link between the riots and poverty. A parallel
analysis of the role social media played in the riots
found that Twitter was not used to organise people to
go looting, as was widely reported, but rather to
respond to the riots: #riotcleanup, used to mobilise
people to clean up the streets after the riots, was one
of the most popular hashtags during the period (Vis,
2012). In this example, sharing mined social media data
with the public and presenting alternative representa-
tions to those that dominated debate could be seen as
an effort to increase publics' understandings of them-
selves as publics, and so to facilitate greater reflexivity
among publics.
The analytics practices undertaken by social actors
on the Storycircle project, discussed above, might also
be seen as efforts to produce reflective and therefore
knowing publics, in that data mining for `social, civic,
cultural or political goals' might mean that social
groups come to know themselves in more reflexive
ways. Other social researchers have also reflected on
how digital methods like social media data mining
may be used to involve publics in the process of know-
ledge construction. This possibility leads Marres
(2012: 141) to argue that `digitization may be unsettling
established divisions of labour in social research'. She
writes that:
As online social research forces us to acknowledge the
contributions of digital devices, practices and subjects,
to the enactment of social research, it can be taken as
an invitation to move beyond ``proprietary'' concepts
of methods, that is, beyond the entrenched use of
method as a way to monopolise the representation of
a given field or aspect of social reality. (Marres, 2012:
160­161)
Likewise, Housley et al. (2014: 4) have argued that
digital methods provide social researchers with new ways
of collaborating with publics, making both a `public soci-
ology' and `citizen social science' possible. Collaborative
Online Social Media Observatory (COSMOS), an aca-
demic project undertaken by these authors, aims to oper-
ate as a `collaboratory' where publics and researchers aim
to produce knowledge together. As Housley et al. (2014:
12) describe it, the project's aim `is to develop the
COSMOS platform as a ``collaboratory'', an element of
participatory research infrastructure supporting public
engagement in a range of activities that includes the
exchange of ideas, debates about the shape of institutions,
current social problems, opportunities and events, as well
astheco-productionofsocialscientificknowledgethrough
citizen social science, where publics act as vital sensors and
interpreters of social life'.
These examples highlight embryonic practices which
seek to use data mining in a way that contributes more
positively to `the mediapolis' (Silverstone, 2007). We
noted above how Gillespie (2014: 189) points to a pos-
sible `friction between ``networked publics'' forged by
users and the ``calculated publics'' offered by algo-
rithms'. But if data mining is used to enable the cre-
ation of more reflexive and active publics in these ways,
the relationship between `networked publics' and `cal-
culated publics' may be understood in more productive
terms, in so far as knowledge generated through data
mining is drawn upon by `networked publics' in order
to understand themselves, each other and public issues.
As Peters (1995: 16) suggests, `in acting upon symbolic
representations of ``the public'' the public can come
into existence as a real actor'. Understood this way,
data mining and analytics are not only mechanisms
for knowing publics, but can be means by which publics
can know themselves.
Conclusion: Social media data mining
and public agency
In this paper, we have considered possible responses to
some of the mains criticisms that have been levelled at
contemporary forms of data mining. In doing so, we
8 Big Data & Society
have attempted to move beyond critique by considering
whether a better relationship between social media data
mining and public life might be possible and what alter-
native arrangements in relation to social media data
mining might look like. We have argued that this
requires a move from `known publics', who are subject
to the data-mining practices of others, to `knowing
publics', who are positioned in relation to data as
more active and reflexive agents.
Concerns about data mining (in terms of increased
surveillance and privacy invasion, related opaque forms
of discrimination, social sorting and control over the
way the public is represented) are now being followed
by calls to do data mining differently and democratise
data power. We have argued that there are three main
ways in which this might be done. Firstly, we noted that
commentators call for data mining to be transparent
and open to public supervision and to be regulated by
public authorities. Greater transparency and account-
ability of data mining are proposed as mechanisms to
facilitate public understanding, debate and action in
relation to data mining. Similarly, to address concerns
about access to data practices, technologies and expert-
ise, there have been calls for data and data mining to be
more accessible and available as a common public
good. Open data movements offer one (albeit not
straightforward) example of this principle in action,
but as yet, considerations of how it might apply to
data mining and to social media data are somewhat
limited. Finally, we suggested building on the notion
that publics exist, in part, through the way they are
represented, in order to consider whether data-mining
practices can be used by publics to constitute them-
selves as more active and reflexive agents. Through
these moves, it may be possible for data mining not
only to be used by elites to produce known publics,
but rather for the public to be more knowing of itself
and to participate in the active production of itself, the
public.
By reflecting on these issues, we have returned to the
issue of agency, central to so many studies which have
sought to explore how cultures and societies are made,
and how they might be made fairer and more equal. In
debates about which has primacy, structures or agency,
structuralist critics would argue that structures not only
determine, but serve to oppress and restrict the agency
of already-disadvantaged groups in society. Some of
the critics discussed in our paper fall into this category.
In contrast, others have stressed the capacity of human
agents to make and shape their worlds, albeit in the
context of constraining structures. Others still have
highlighted the dialectical relationship between struc-
ture and agency: structures shape and constrain
human agency, but human agents act against, as well
as within, them. We share this view. Cultural critic
Jeremy Gilbert advocates such a position, a perspective
which, he says, acknowledges `the potency of both of
these modes of analysis and the fact that they can both
be true simultaneously'. In fact, he goes on to argue, `I
want to insist that we can't understand how capitalist
culture works without understanding that they are both
true' (Gilbert, 2012). It is within this ever-present, dia-
lectic tension between structure and agency that this
paper is situated. Returning to Couldry's (2014: 891)
definition of agency as `the longer processes of action
based on reflection, giving an account of what one has
done, even more basically, making sense of the world so
as to act within it', we maintain that greater public
agency in relation to data mining might be possible,
under the conditions discussed in the second half of
this paper. However far away we might currently be
from realising these imaginings, it is certainly worth
having them in sight.
