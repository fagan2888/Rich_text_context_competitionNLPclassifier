Article
Clinical supervision is widely considered to be an essential
component of psychotherapy training (Bernard & Goodyear,
2014). Within most models of supervision, one of the supervi-
sors' most important responsibilities is ensuring and protect-
ing client welfare (e.g., Ellis & Ladany, 1997). For example, in
their competency-based model for supervision, Falender and
Shafranske (2004) stated, "The most important task of the
supervisor is to monitor the supervisee's conduct to ensure . . .
the best possible clinical outcome for the client" (p. 4).
This conceptualization implies that supervisors can and
should have an effect on client outcome. However, doubts
have been raised about the extent of impact supervisors
can have on client outcome due to the many variables at
the supervisor and supervisee levels that may moderate
outcome (e.g., Holloway, 1984). These variables include,
but are not limited to, factors such as quality of the super-
visory working alliance (Ellis & Ladany, 1997) and the
extent of collaboration in supervision (Rousmaniere,
Swift, Babins-Wagner, Whipple, & Berzins, 2014). In their
discussion of supervision research, Wampold and Holloway
(1997) stated, "Detection of a relation between supervision
process and the patient's rating of patient change (the most
distal outcome) would be expected to be extremely small"
(p. 23). Likewise, Ladany and Inman (2012) recommended
modest expectations for supervisors' impact on client out-
come: "Supervision may have an effect on client outcome;
however, supervisors should recognize that the effect in
many instances may be minimal" (p. 195).
Research on the supervisor-to-client outcome connection
is similarly mixed. Three reviews of the literature have been
conducted which examines this link (Freitas, 2002; Milne,
Sheikh, Pattison, & Wilkinson, 2011; Watkins, 2011). While
these reviews have found some support for the theory that
supervision may impact client outcome, methodological
concerns within the individual studies can be found in each
of the three studies. These methodological issues are signifi-
cant enough to raise serious doubts about their findings (e.g.,
nonrandom assignment of participants, reliance on supervi-
sor/supervisee self-report, use of outcome measures with
poor psychometric properties).
The strongest evidence linking supervision to client out-
come can be found in three individual studies with stronger
methodologies (Bambling, King, Raue, Schweitzer, &
Lambert, 2006; Callahan, Almstrom, Swift, Borja, & Heath,

Abstract
Clinical supervision is considered to be an essential component of psychotherapy training. However, research on supervisors'
ability to affect client outcome has been mixed. This investigation aims to answer two questions: (a) What is the perceived
impact of supervision on client outcome, and (b) how important is it to supervisors and supervisees that supervision affects
client outcome? A mixed-methods approach was used to examine the perspectives of both supervisors and supervisees. The
survey consisted of survey questions and one open-ended qualitative question. Findings suggest that both supervisors and
supervisees perceive supervision as beneficial and important for impacting client outcome. Supervisees perceive supervision
as more important in impacting outcome than supervisors. Existing literature suggests that supervision may not have as
significant an impact on client outcome as previously believed; however, supervisors and supervisees perceive the supervision
process as essential for psychotherapy training. Implications and future directions are discussed.

2 SAGE Open
2009; Reese et al., 2009). Each of these studies yielded sig-
nificantly different results, and despite stronger methodol-
ogy than the reviews cited above, the extent to which
supervision impacts client outcome is unclear. Bambling
et al. (2006) used an experimental design, in which 127 cli-
ents were randomly assigned to 127 licensed therapists, half
of whom received supervision for eight sessions of problem-
solving treatment. Clients of therapists receiving supervision
had higher scores on both measures of treatment outcome
and working alliance (Bambling et al., 2006). Callahan and
colleagues (2009) used a naturalistic data set to examine the
outcomes of 76 adult psychotherapy clients who were ran-
domly assigned to 40 trainee therapists, who were in supervi-
sion with nine supervisors. Supervisors were found to
account for 16% of the variance in client outcome (Callahan
et al., 2009). Reese et al. (2009) performed a controlled study
in which the outcomes of trainees receiving supervision that
included regular outcome feedback (n = 9) were compared
with the outcomes of trainees receiving supervision without
regular outcome feedback (n = 10). Data included 115 psy-
chotherapy cases collected over the course of a year. Trainees
in the supervision-with-feedback condition had significantly
better outcomes than trainees receiving supervision without
feedback. No significant differences were found between
supervisors within the treatment conditions (Reese et al.,
2009).
On the contrary, a recent study examined this topic with
a large sample from routine practice and found null results
(Author & Coauthors, 2014). In this study, a 5-year archi-
val naturalistic data set of psychotherapy outcomes from a
private, nonprofit mental health center was used to test
whether client treatment outcomes (as measured by the
Outcome Questionnaire­45.2 [OQ-45.2]) differed depend-
ing on who was providing the supervision (Lambert et al.,
2004).The data included 6,688 clients seen by 174 trainee
therapists who were supervised by 14 supervisors. Results
indicated that supervisors explained less than .01% of the
variance in client psychotherapy outcomes (Author, 2014).
Thus, the extent to which supervisors can affect client out-
come is still unclear. In light of these results, the question
still remains: To what extent does supervision impact cli-
ent outcome? In his summary of the research on the sub-
ject, Watkins (2011) concluded, "After a century of
psychotherapy supervision and over half a century of
supervision research, we still cannot empirically answer
that question" (p. 252).
Given this research, it is unrealistic to state that the pri-
mary task of clinical supervision is to ensure the greatest
possible treatment outcome for clients. Hence, there is a
clear need to determine whether supervisors and supervisees
even believe the supervision process is impactful on client
outcome. If the existing literature suggests that supervision
has little impact on client outcome, it would be important to
determine whether supervisors and supervisees share this
perception.
Our aim for this study, which has yet to be investigated,
was to use a mixed-methods design to better understand
supervisor and supervisee perceptions of the supervision­
client outcome relationship.
The first major goal of this investigation was to examine
supervisors' and supervisees' opinions of two questions: (a)
What is the extent of impact supervisors can have on client out-
comes, and (b) how important is it that supervisors can affect
client outcome? Drawing from treatment-outcome literature
(e.g., Lambert, 2013), these two questions explored four major
areas of client outcome: positive impact of treatment, client
deterioration, client dropout, and speed/efficiency of treatment.
In addition, we sought to examine the relation between each
participant's answers to the two research questions:
Research Question 1: What is the perceived impact of
supervision on client outcome?
Research Question 2: How important is it to supervisors
and supervisees that supervision affects client outcome?
The second major goal of this study was to explore super-
visors' and supervisees' perspectives on how supervisors
affect client outcome. In other words, what specific activities
of supervision enable the supervisor to impact client out-
come? It is important to note that it is still unclear how super-
vision may actually impact client outcome. Given the
exploratory nature of this investigation, the authors did not
make any hypotheses about how supervisors and supervisees
would respond to the quantitative items or their open-ended
qualitative responses to this topic.
Method
Participants
Supervisors.The supervisor participants were 189 individu-
als who were recruited through various listservs that were
associated with a variety of clinical, counseling, and educa-
tion psychology graduate school programs. Of these partici-
pants, the majority identified as female (64.6%) and 34.4%
as male. Supervisors had an average age of 51.72 years (SD
= 11.55, range = 28.0-78.0) and an average of 14.36 years of
experience practicing as a supervisor (SD = 9.7, range =
1-46). The primary therapeutic modality most frequently
practiced by supervisors was eclectic/integrative (28.7%),
followed by cognitive-behavioral (17.9%), psychodynamic
(15.9%), Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing
(EMDR, 6.2%), interpersonal (5.6%), Rogerian/client-cen-
tered (2.6%), experiential (2.1%), and other/no primary
(21.1%) modality. Just under half (45.0%) of supervisors
reported having their supervisees use quantitative outcome
measures to assess client outcome.
Supervisees.One hundred eighty-five supervisees com-
pleted the online survey. Supervisees came from a variety of
Rast et al. 3
counseling, clinical and education counseling graduate pro-
grams. Of the participants, the majority identified as female
(79.6%) and 19.9% as male, and one did not report a gender.
Supervisees had an average age of 32.56 years (SD = 8.39,
range = 22-61). Supervisees reported an average of 24.95
months (SD = 19.20, range = 1.0-72.0) of experience work-
ing with clients face-to-face. Supervisees were also asked to
estimate the total number of clients they had worked with
face-to-face and reported an average of 72.34 total clients
(SD = 93.88, range = 1.0-600.0). Just over half, 51.3%, of
supervisees were in a master's program, 47.6% were in a
doctoral program, and 2.1% did not report their type of
graduate program. Supervisees reported that their primary
therapeutic modality was eclectic/integrative (29.3%),
cognitive-behavioral (15.7%), psychodynamic (15.2%),
Rogerian/client-centered (7.3%), interpersonal (6.3%),
experiential (2.6%), EMDR (.5%), and other/no primary
(23.0%) modality. Supervisees reported that their supervi-
sor's primary therapeutic modality was eclectic/integrative
(20.4%), cognitive-behavioral (18.8%), psychodynamic
(18.8%), interpersonal (4.7%), Rogerian/client-centered
(3.1%), EMDR (2.6%), experiential (1.6%), other/no pri-
mary modality (19.4%), and did not know their supervisor's
primary therapeutic (10.5%) modality. Under half (38.2%)
of supervisees reported using quantitative outcome mea-
sures to assess client outcome.
To explore whether any outstanding demographic differ-
ences existed, a series of independent-sample t tests and one-
way ANOVAs were used to explore the demographic
differences within supervisors' extent and importance on
impact scores. These tests explored both overall differences
between the constructs of extent and importance of supervi-
sion, as well as examined single-item variations for both
supervisors and supervisees. Within supervisees, a series of
independent-sample t tests and one-way ANOVAs were used
to explore the demographic differences on extent and impor-
tance of impact scores. All analyses were conducted through
SPSS.
Measures
Supervisors. Supervisors completed an online survey with a
total of 15 questions. The questions on the supervisor survey
were developed by the authors who are practicing supervi-
sors and supervision researchers. The questions were then
pilot-tested with six practicing supervisors and revised for
clarity. The first four questions in the survey were presented
as a group, with the following header: "For the specific areas
below, rate the positive impact your supervision has on your
supervisees' clients' outcomes." The four areas were as fol-
lows: (a) "My supervision increases the positive impact of
my trainees' counseling/psychotherapy," (b) "My supervi-
sion prevents or reduces my trainees' client deterioration,"
(c) "My supervision prevents or reduces my trainees' client
dropout," and (d) "My supervision increases the speed or
efficiency of my trainees' counseling/psychotherapy." These
questions were answered along a 5-point Likert-type scale,
from 1 = "do not agree" to 5 = "totally agree," and a sum
score was computed.
The next four questions were presented as another group,
with the following header: "When you consider the diverse
range of skills that someone must have to be an effective
supervisor, how important is the supervisor's overall ability
to impact their supervisees' clients' outcomes?" The four
areas were as follows: (a) "Increase the positive impact of
counseling/psychotherapy," (b) "Prevent or reduce client
deterioration," (c) "Prevent or reduce client dropout," and (d)
"Increase the speed or efficiency of counseling/psychother-
apy." These questions were answered also along a 5-point
Likert-type scale, from 1 = "no importance" to 5 = "highest
importance," and a sum score was computed. Cronbach's
alpha for these items in this sample was .76, indicating fair
internal consistency.
Questions 9 and 10 asked whether supervisor participants
have their supervisees use quantitative measures to track
their client outcome, and, if so, which measure(s). For the
qualitative portion of this study, Question 11 asked, "Other
than what has been identified above, please list any other
ways that you feel your supervision has a positive impact on
your supervisee's client's outcomes." This question allowed
for any length of answer. The remaining four items were
demographic questions (age, gender, primary therapeutic
orientation, and years of experience as a supervisor).
Supervisees. Supervisees completed an online survey with a
total of 18 questions. The questions on the supervisee survey
were developed by the authors who are supervisors, pilot-
tested with six practicing supervisees, and revised for clarity.
The first four questions in the survey were presented as a
group, with the following header: "In your opinion, how
much does your current primary individual supervisor help
you to help your clients?" The four areas were as follows: (a)
"My supervisor helps me increase the positive impact of my
counseling/psychotherapy," (b) "My supervisor helps me
prevent or reduce the risk of my clients deteriorating," (c)
"My supervisor helps me prevent or reduce the risk of my
clients dropping out," and (d) "My supervisor helps me
increase the speed or efficiency of my counseling/psycho-
therapy." These questions were answered along a 5-point
Likert-type scale, from 1 = "do not agree" to 5 = "totally
agree," and a sum score was computed. Cronbach's alpha for
these items in this sample was .87, indicating good internal
consistency.
The next four questions were presented as another group,
with the following header: "In your opinion, how important is
it that your supervisor is able to help you help your clients?"
The four areas were as follows: (a) "How important is it that
your supervisor can help you increase the positive impact of
your counseling/psychotherapy," (b) "How important is it
that your supervisor can help you prevent or reduce the risk of
4 SAGE Open
client deterioration," (c) "How important is it that your super-
visor can help you prevent or reduce the risk of client drop-
out," and (d) "How important is it that your supervisor can
help you increase the speed or efficiency of your counseling/
psychotherapy." These questions were answered along a
5-point Likert-type scale, from 1 = "no importance" to 5 =
"highest importance," and a sum score was computed.
Questions 9 and 10 asked whether supervisee participants
have their supervisees use quantitative measures to track their
client outcome, and, if so, which measure(s). Similar to super-
visor inquiry, Question 11 asked, "Other than what has been
identified above, please list any other ways that you feel your
supervisor has a positive impact on your clients' outcomes."
This question allowed any length of answer. The remaining
seven items were demographic questions (age, gender, pri-
mary therapeutic orientation, supervisor's primary therapeutic
orientation, months of experience working with clients in
face-to-face individual counseling/psychotherapy, total num-
ber of clients worked with in face-to-face individual counsel-
ing/psychotherapy, and type of degree program).
Qualitative Methodology
A discovery-oriented-exploratory qualitative research method-
ology (Mahrer, 1988) was used to analyze supervisors'
responses to the question, "Other than what has been identified
above, please list any other ways that you feel your supervisor
has a positive impact on your clients'outcomes," and supervis-
ees'responses to the question, "Other than what has been iden-
tified above, please list any other ways that you feel your
supervision has a positive impact on your supervisee's client's
outcomes." Analysis was conducted by three of the authors,
who attempted to follow the guidelines of discovery-oriented
methodology (e.g., Yeh & Inman, 2007). Before starting data
analysis, the authors discussed their own expectations, values,
and biases toward the research material, including assumptions
based on their self-identities, with an eye for the power differ-
entials inherent in the roles of supervisor and supervisees.
Each judge reviewed all of the supervisors' responses,
creating and sorting them into mutually exclusive categories.
The judges then met as a team to discuss their different cat-
egories and create a codebook. The team coded all of the
supervisors' responses, and disagreements were discussed
and resolved by consensus. This process was repeated for the
supervisees' responses. The three judges came to consensus
on the supervisor and supervisee codes. The team then
reviewed and discussed both codebooks, modifying and
recoding the associated responses until there was 100% con-
sensus. Codes that represented fewer than 1.00% of partici-
pant responses were dropped from the codebook.
Procedures
Participants for the supervisor and supervisee surveys were
recruited through purposive sampling using a wide range of
email listservs, including graduate programs, regional asso-
ciations, and national associations, and for specific therapeu-
tic modalities (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy). As an
incentive to participate, an opportunity to enter a drawing for
one of two US$50 Amazon.com gift certificates was offered.
Participation was voluntary and anonymous. The secure
online survey was hosted at http://www.psychdata.com. Both
surveys were available online for 2 weeks, during which
time 194 supervisors and 196 supervisees completed them.
Participants with missing data or with z scores  |3.5| were
removed. Five supervisors and five supervisees were
removed, leaving data that included 189 supervisors and 191
supervisees.
Results
The major goal of this investigation sought to explore the
perspectives of both supervisors and supervisees on the
extent and importance of which supervision impacts client
outcome.
Demographic Differences Between Supervisor
and Supervisee Responses
Through a series of independent-sample t tests and one-way
ANOVAs, no significant differences were found within
supervisors regarding the extent or importance scores for
gender, age, therapeutic modality, years of supervising, or
between supervisors who used outcome measures and those
who did not. Furthermore, within supervisees, there were no
significant differences found within extent and importance
scores for gender, age, therapeutic modality, degree type,
months of experience, number of clients, or between super-
visees whose supervisors used outcome measures and those
who did not.
Quantitative Findings
To compare quantitative findings across supervisors and
supervisees, their responses to the four questions that made
up extent of supervisor impact, and the four questions that
made up importance of supervisor impact, were totaled sepa-
rately and then averaged. The average score for each main
question can be found in Table 1.
Extent of supervisor impact on outcomes
Overall scores.A series of independent-sample t tests
were used to compare the average extent of impact scores
between supervisors (n = 189) and supervisees (n = 191).
On average, supervisors showed positive scores of M =
3.65, SD = 0.68, and supervisees also showed positive
scores of M = 3.54, SD = 0.94, with a mean difference
of M = 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [-.06, .27],
between the groups. This difference was not significant,
t(378) = 1.27, p > .05, d = 0.12.
Rast et al. 5
Single-item analysis. A series of independent-sample t tests
were used to compare differences between supervisors (n =
189) and supervisees (n = 191) in how they responded to the
four items related to the extent of impact (1-4). There were
no significant differences found between supervisors and
supervisees within the items related to the extent of impact.
Importance of supervisors' impact on client outcomes
Overall scores. A series of independent-sample t tests were
used to compare the average importance of impact scores
between supervisors (n = 189) and supervisees (n = 191). On
average, supervisors showed positive scores of M = 3.87, SD
= 0.56, and supervisees also showed positive scores of M =
4.06, SD = 0.62, with a mean difference of M = -0.18, 95%
CI = [-.30, .06], between the groups. This difference was
significant, t(378) = -2.97, p < .05, d = 0.23, indicating that
supervisees find the impact of supervision significantly more
important for client outcomes than supervisors.
Single-item analysis. A series of independent-sample t tests
were used to compare differences between supervisors (n =
189) and supervisees (n = 191) in how they responded to the
four items related to the importance of impact (5-8). There
were no significant differences between supervisors and
supervisees on Item 7 or 8. Significance levels and t-scores
for all items can be found in Table 1.
Item 5 asked about the importance of supervision in
increasing the positive impact of counseling/psychotherapy.
On average, supervisors showed positive scores of M = 4.18,
SD = 0.71, and supervisees also showed positive scores of M
= 4.41, SD = 0.66, with a mean difference of M = -0.23, 95%
CI = [-.37, .09], between the groups. This difference was
significant, t(378) = -3.24, p < .05, d = 0.28, indicating that
supervisees found supervision to be more important than
supervisors for increasing the positive impact of counseling/
psychotherapy.
Item 6 asked about the importance of supervision in
preventing or reducing client deterioration. On average,
supervisors showed positive scores of M = 4.01, SD =
0.73, and supervisees also showed positive scores of M =
4.21, SD = 0.71, with a mean difference of M = -0.21,
95% CI = [-.36, -.06], between the groups. This differ-
ence was significant, t(378) = -2.83, p < .05, d = 0.28,
indicating that supervisees found supervision to be more
important than supervisors for preventing or reducing cli-
ent deterioration.
Qualitative Data
One hundred nine (57.67%) supervisors and 120 (62.83%)
supervisees responded to the qualitative questions. The qual-
itative methodology aimed to examine the various ways that
supervisors and supervisees perceived supervision to impact
client outcome.
Supervisor responses.In response to the question "ways
that feel your supervision has a positive impact on your
supervisees' clients' outcomes," the highest responses
indicated references to personal/professional growth by
supervisees. Examples such as "helping supervisee iden-
tify and address their own `self of therapist' issues that
arise" and "professional development issues for supervis-
ees" accounted for slightly less than half of all supervisor
responses. The second most frequently endorsed response
specified references to the therapeutic relationship as most
impactful to positive client outcomes. Supervisors reported
examples such as "By drawing attention toward issues of
countertransference and interpersonal impact of client on
clinician and vice versa" and "challenging them to develop
a collaborative relationship with their clients." Descriptive
statistics and content of qualitative supervisor data can be
seen in Table 2.

Discussion
The purpose of this study was to explore the perceived extent
and importance of impact that supervision has on client out-
come. The first overarching finding within the study was that
both supervisor and supervisee participants appeared to have
a positive endorsement (i.e., agreement that supervision was
important and impactful) in their responses to the research
questions:
Research Question 1: What is the perceived impact of
supervision on client outcome?
Research Question 2: How important is it to supervisors
and supervisees that supervision affects client outcome?
These results are not surprising, given that current models of
supervision indicate that one of the primary tasks of supervi-
sion is to ensure the best outcome for clients and would
Rast et al. 7
therefore suggest that supervisors and supervisees would
likely assume it is both beneficial and important (Falender &
Shafranske, 2004). Participant responses were consistently
positive across all four major areas of client outcome that
were addressed (increasing positive impact of treatment,
reducing client deterioration, reducing client dropout, and
increasing speed/efficiency of treatment). These findings
have strong support from both the quantitative and qualita-
tive data, suggesting that there is a stark contrast with how
positively supervisors and supervisees view the impact of
supervision in comparison with current outcome research,
which suggests that supervision may have a smaller impact
on outcome than previously believed (Ladany & Inman,
2012). Notably, in the qualitative data, only six supervisors
and seven supervisees expressed hesitation or doubts about
the impact of supervision on client outcome. The responses
of both groups (supervision and supervisees) to the two
major research questions revealed significant correlations,
suggesting that participants who thought that supervisors can
impact client outcome also thought that it was important that

supervisors do impact client outcome, and vice versa.
Although these perceptions match the current theory pro-
posed by most major supervision models, it begs the ques-
tion of how supervision goes about impacting client outcome,
both positively and negatively.
Differences between how supervisors and supervisees
responded to questions related to the extent of impact and
importance of impact of supervision on client outcome were
examined. Overall, there were no significant differences
between supervisors' and supervisees' perception of the
extent that supervision can impact client outcome, suggest-
ing that both groups find supervision equally impactful on
client outcomes.
Conversely, the findings revealed that supervisors and
supervisees did differ in their perceptions on the impor-
tance of supervision, with significant differences between
the two groups in how they responded to questions relat-
ing to the importance of supervision impacting client out-
come. The data indicated that supervisees perceive
supervision as more important to impacting client out-
come than supervisors do. In addition, within the con-
struct of importance to impact, supervisees perceived
supervision as more important than supervisors for
increasing positive impact of therapy, as well as for pre-
venting or reducing client deterioration.
The second goal of this study was to explore partici-
pants' opinions regarding how supervisors affect client
outcome. Participants responded in a variety ways, with
responses ranging from a supportive supervisory rela-
tionship to general techniques and tools. Participants also
reported that various aspects of supervision that address
specific treatment variables benefit client outcome (e.g.,
"psychotherapy models and techniques," "therapeutic
relationship"). Conversely, both supervisors and super-
visees reported that the aspects of supervision that address
these variables at the supervisee level would also benefit
client outcome. For example, "supervisee growth" was
the most frequently reported category for supervisors,
and the third most frequently reported for supervisees.
Further research into what constitutes "supervisee
growth" and how it has a positive impact on client out-
come is needed.
Two notable differences within the qualitative data
between supervisor and supervisee responses stood out.
Supervisees reported the "supervisory relationship" as more
impactful to client outcome, whereas more than twice as
many supervisors endorsed the "therapeutic relationship."
These findings suggest a significant difference in perspec-
tive between the two groups regarding the relative impor-
tance of the supervisory and therapeutic relationship. In
addition, these results suggest that further research is needed
in exploring what aspects of both the supervisory and thera-
peutic relationships in clinical supervision are impacting cli-
ent outcome, if at all.
Implications and Future Directions
Overall, the data suggest that the impact of supervision on
client outcome, as perceived by the supervisors and super-
visees, is perceived to be a complex process by both groups,
involving a coalescence of treatment, supervisee, and
supervision variables. Supervisors and supervisees both
view supervision as important; however, supervisees feel
supervision is more important in comparison with supervi-
sors. These may suggest that supervisees value more sup-
port, feedback, and guidance from their supervisors,
regardless of potential impact on client outcome. Despite
these differences, the data suggest that both groups feel
supervision is important to client outcome. These findings
would seem predictable of "common sense." However, the
results of this study have yet to be quantitatively or qualita-
tively established in the existing literature. Furthermore,
this research is necessary to identify what supervisors and
supervisees believe is impacted by supervision, if not client
outcome (e.g., supervisee professional identity, supportive
environment for supervisees, etc.).
Current research suggests that supervision, theoreti-
cally and in clinical practice, has a minimal impact on cli-
ent outcome, despite the primary task of supervision being
to ensure the best possible outcome for the client. Most
supervisors and supervisees proceed within supervision as
if it is both important and impactful to client outcome.
However, if client outcome is not being impacted by super-
vision, further research is needed to determine what in
supervision may actually be impacted. Furthermore, if we
proceed as though supervision is both important and
impactful to client outcome, future studies would need to
examine what aspects of clinical supervision actually
impact outcome and what practices would need to be
changed to ensure a positive impact on client outcome,
allowing for an opportunity to improve upon future models
of supervision.
Given the discrepancy between study participants' beliefs
that supervision is both impactful and important, and the out-
come research that suggests a smaller effect, there is a clear
need to uncover what it is about supervision that results in
this endorsement by supervisors and supervisees. It is possi-
ble that a similar self-assessment bias thatWalfish, McAlister,
O'Donnell, and Lambert (2012) found among practicing
psychotherapists is occurring at a supervision level, where
supervisors and supervisees have a tendency to overestimate
the ability of contemporary supervision practices to impact
client outcome. Supervisors and supervisees may be using
positive perceptions of supervision as another means of
maintaining morale in the face of challenging clients within
a demanding field. "Self-assessment bias may simply be the
unconscious attempt to stay motivated in the face of very dif-
ficult client problems and circumstances" (Walfish et al.,
2012, p. 642).

Limitations
There are multiple limitations that are often associated with a
nonstandardized, self-report survey. Underreporting of nega-
tive behaviors and responding to questions in a way that por-
trays the responder in a positive regard are the two most
common limitations associated with this method of research
(Donaldson & Grant-Vallone, 2002). In addition, nonstandard-
ized, self-report survey research may also focus too broadly on
a range of topics, which may result in a lack of depth or full
understanding in the topic at hand. The qualitative portion of
this research was conducted with these limitations in mind,
and the shortcomings of this research methodology were taken
into account when examining the results.
Another limitation of this study may be attributed to the
fact that the survey only asked for supervisees to comment
on their experiences with their current supervisor. It is pos-
sible that supervisees may have had a different experience
with supervision overall. It should be noted that supervisees
may have responded differently to the study if the question
inquired about overall supervision experiences.
A major limitation to this study pertains to the question
used to address the qualitative aspect of this study. The quali-
tative question had a narrow focus, potentially limiting the
range of answers that supervisees and supervisors could have
provided. By specifically asking supervisees what their
supervisors contributed to having a positive impact on their
clients' outcome, the opportunity to explore an organic,
broad-range response from supervisees about what they felt
was impactful was lost. While a more open-ended question
may have been beneficial in this instance, the exploratory
nature of this study benefited with the specific question to
use as a reference point to guide future research on this topic.
Several of the limitations within this study can be attrib-
uted to the restrictive nature of the qualitative portion, which
was constrained by the format of an Internet-based survey.
This medium of data collection prevented any modification
to the research question, limiting the spontaneity of natural
responses between participant and researcher. Future
research could implement the interview approach to allow
for more in-depth responses from participants and a more
conductive relationship between researcher and participant.
The mixed-methods approach of this study may have
impacted potential responses from participants. The quanti-
tative portion was administered before the qualitative ques-
tions, which may have primed participant responses. In
addition, the qualitative coding done by the researchers may
have been unknowingly influenced by the biases of the team
members. Although precautions were taken in an attempt to
combat these biases, it is possible that biases shared by the
three-team members may have potentially influenced the
results. Further research would be helpful to capture a wider
understanding of what supervisees find helpful to client out-
comes from their supervisors and would be able to account
for the potential limitations that exist within this study.
In summary, these results indicated that both supervisors
and supervisees believe that supervision has an impact on
client outcome; however, there is no clear consensus of how
supervision impacts client outcome and to what degree.
Further research is needed to explore what aspects of super-
vision, if any, impact client outcome.
