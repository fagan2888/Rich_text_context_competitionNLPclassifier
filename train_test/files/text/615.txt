Comparing Standard and Selective
Degradation DNA Extraction Methods: Results
from a Field Experiment with Sexual Assault
Kits*,
ABSTRACT: A growing number of U.S. cities have large numbers of untested sexual assault kits (SAKs) in police property facilities. Test-
ing older kits and maintaining current case work will be challenging for forensic laboratories, creating a need for more efficient testing meth-
ods. Methods: We evaluated selective degradation methods for DNA extraction using actual case work from a sample of previously
unsubmitted SAKs in Detroit, Michigan. We randomly assigned 350 kits to either standard or selective degradation testing methods and then
compared DNA testing rates and CODIS entry rates between the two groups. Results and conclusions: Continuation-ratio modeling showed no
significant differences, indicating that the selective degradation method had no decrement in performance relative to customary methods. Fol-
low-up equivalence tests indicated that CODIS entry rates for the two methods could differ by more than Æ5%. Selective degradation methods
required less personnel time for testing and scientific review than standard testing.
KEYWORDS: forensic science, selective degradation, DNA, forensic testing, sexual assault kits, rape kits, CODIS
Large numbers of untested sexual assault kits (SAKs) have
been found in police property facilities throughout the United
States (1­6). This growing national problem has raised concerns
among criminal justice system practitioners and victim advocates
alike. When SAKs (also termed `rape kits') are not submitted for
forensic DNA testing, there is no opportunity for the evidence
within these kits to help prosecute perpetrators, protect public
safety, and/or exonerate those who have been wrongly accused
of crimes they did not commit (1,6). Even if tested years after
their original collection, previously untested SAKs still have the
potential to provide actionable information for police and prose-
cutors, so many jurisdictions are deciding to submit their kits for
forensic testing, often thousands of SAKs at a time (5), which
presents substantial challenges for forensic science laboratories.
To meet these increasing demands for testing, it is essential that
laboratories have DNA testing methods that are time, staff, and
resource efficient, without sacrificing quality. To that end, in this
study, we examined an emerging method that has shown pro-
mise in the forensic science literature for its efficiency and qual-
ity--selective degradation (7,8). Using actual casework from one
U.S. city that had thousands of untested SAKs in police prop-
erty, Detroit, Michigan, we compared the forensic testing out-
comes of SAKs analyzed with selective degradation or standard
methods.
Over the past thirty years, there have been revolutionary
changes in how biological evidence can be tested and used by
the criminal justice system (9­12). The general process of testing
crime scene evidence for DNA includes body fluid identification
(serology) screening of the samples to determine whether they
contain biological evidence (e.g., semen, saliva, blood), extract-
ing the DNA from the samples, quantifying the amount of DNA
extracted, characterizing the DNA, and finally analyzing and
interpreting the results (9). Over the years, different methods
have been developed for the extraction, amplification, separation,
and analysis steps, and in the past decade, newer methods have
been developed that allows forensic scientists to skip traditional
serology screening in favor of faster screening methods that
determine whether there is any male DNA in the samples (Y-
marker screening methods). The development of short tandem
repeat (STR) typing techniques and polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) methods have been particularly impactful advancements
for offering faster analysis with smaller samples (10). There have
also been significant successes in decreasing overall testing time
through the use of automation (13) and microchip technology
(14,15).

More recently, other strategies for reducing testing time have
emerged, ones that focus on improving efficiency within specific
steps of the DNA testing process. One of the more time-consum-
ing processes in testing samples from SAKs is separating the
sperm cells from all other cells (e.g., male epithelial cells, female
epithelial cells). National epidemiological data indicate that most
sexual assault victims are female and most perpetrators are male
(16), so the task of separating male and female DNA is neces-
sary for the vast majority of SAKs submitted for forensic testing.
Traditionally, the differential lysis method has been used, which
"relies on separation of intact sperm from the DNA of digested
epithelial cells by centrifugation and careful removal of super-
natant, a process that remains unchanged since it was first
described in 1985" (7). For decades, standard practice has been
to physically separate the offender's sperm from all other cells
by use of a centrifuge and then to wash the sample repeatedly to
remove any remaining female DNA. This process for DNA
extraction has been criticized for its tediousness, difficulty to
automate, and riskiness for losing sperm from the sample (8).
To address these problems, selective degradation methods
were created, which utilize chemical techniques for the separa-
tion of male and female DNA (see Fig. 1). Nonsperm cells (e.g.,
male offender epithelial, female victim epithelial cells) are chem-
ically lysed; the sperm heads are resistant to this process and are
not lysed. This first step produces a pellet of sperm heads with
residual DNA from the lysed nonsperm cells. A nuclease is used
to remove remnants of nonsperm DNA from the sperm head pel-
let. The nuclease is deactivated prior to chemical rupture of the
sperm heads, producing a relatively pure male DNA sample for
further analysis (7,8). As Garvin and colleagues (2009)
explained, "the addition of a degradative agent is inherently
easier than a physical separation process and can require only a
single pipetting step" (7., pp. 1297).
To evaluate the efficacy of the selective degradation method,
Garvin et al. (2009) analyzed postcoital vaginal swabs from con-
sensual vaginal­penile sexual intercourse; swabs were divided
lengthwise and then randomly assigned to DNA testing method
(standard vs. selective degradation). As expected, the samples
treated with the nuclease had far less contamination by female
DNA, making identification of the male profile substantially
easier. Garvin et al. (2009) also obtained archived swabs from
five criminal sexual assault cases and randomly assigned sam-
ples to testing condition. In three samples, there was similar per-
formance between the two methods, and for two samples,
selective degradation produced superior STR profiles than stan-
dard methods. In a follow-up efficacy study, Garvin et al.
(2012) compared STR profiles generated by selective degrada-
tion and standard methods from three types of samples:
semen-spiked female buccal swabs, postcoital vaginal swabs
from consensual sex, and four samples from actual criminal sex-
ual assault casework. Across all three types of samples, the STR
profiles of male DNA fractions extracted via selective degrada-
tion were of equal or better quality than those obtained using
standard methods.
The results of these efficacy studies are promising, so a key
next step in this line of research is to evaluate selective degrada-
tion methods with larger samples of actual sexual assault case-
work. It is also important to examine whether there are any
"downstream" implications of this testing method with respect to
whether and how the results may be utilized by criminal justice
system practitioners; specifically, in regard to whether a profile
will qualify for entry into CODIS. CODIS (Combined DNA
Index System) is the U.S. national forensic DNA database,
which consists of reference DNA profiles from arrestees/con-
victed offenders and from samples obtained at crime scenes
(9,17­19). A DNA profile may be eligible for entry into CODIS
if it meets specified standards regarding biological quality of the
sample, and reasonable assurances that a crime was in fact com-
mitted and that the forensic sample is most likely from the
alleged perpetrator (9,11,12,18­20). If a DNA profile meets
these standards, then it can be compared to the reference sam-
ples in CODIS, and if there is a match (termed a "hit"), then
law enforcement personnel have a promising investigative lead.
To date, no prior studies have compared rates of CODIS entry
stemming from different DNA testing methods to determine
whether resulting profiles are more or less likely to qualify for
CODIS. Because a CODIS entry is a necessary condition for a
CODIS hit, it is useful to examine this outcome as a first step in
understanding how testing methods can affect law enforcement
and prosecutorial utilization of forensic testing findings. If there
are "downstream" differences such that CODIS entry rates for a
particular DNA testing method are significantly higher or lower
than another method, such findings could be concerning for
criminal justice system practitioners. However, if the rates of
CODIS entry are functionally equivalent across testing methods,
but one method is notably more resource efficient, then such
information could be helpful to laboratory administrators and
their colleagues in law enforcement and prosecution for estab-
lishing methods for SAK testing, particularly if this effect was
established with actual criminal sexual assault casework.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine forensic
testing outcomes in a sample of 350 SAKs from Detroit, Michi-
gan. This sample was selected from the larger population of
approximately 8,500 untested SAKs that were found in a Detroit
police department storage facility in August, 2009 (21). When
these untested SAKs were discovered, a multidisciplinary action
research project was formed with funding from the National
Institute of Justice to bring together researchers and law enforce-
ment personnel, prosecutors, forensic scientists, nurses/medical
personnel, and victim advocates to develop data-driven response
strategies (22). A primary goal of this action research project
was to develop empirically informed approaches for resolving
large numbers of untested SAKs, which provided an opportunity
to evaluate promising DNA testing methods with actual case-
work. To that end, we randomly selected a sample of SAKs
(N = 350) and randomly assigned kits to either standard DNA
testing methods or selective degradation methods. In contrast to
prior formative studies on selective degradation by Garvin and
colleagues (7,8), our focus was not the forensic adequacy of the
method (i.e., STR profile quality), but rather its potential utility
to criminal justice system practitioners. As such, we quantified
and compared how many SAKs in each testing group proceeded
from serology screening to DNA testing to CODIS-eligible pro-
files, as well as how the methods compared with respect to the
cost of consumable supplies and the amount of personnel effort
required to test, interpret, and review the testing results.
Methods
Sample
The sample contained a total of 350 SAKs, which were asso-
ciated with a total of 344 unique assailants. Descriptive charac-
teristics of the victims, offenders, and sexual assaults associated
with these SAKs are documented in Table 1 (for each testing
method and for the overall sample). Nearly all of these victims
214 JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES
were female (96.6%) and the assailants were male (94.9%). It is
important to note that in female-perpetrated sexual assaults,
selective degradation methods would not be appropriate (regard-
less of which testing condition to which the kit was assigned),
and standard methods would be utilized. In this project, only
one SAK associated with a female assailant was assigned to the
selective degradation testing group, but it did not pass the body
fluid identification (serology) screening, so this was not a con-
cern in this study. Four of the SAKs randomly assigned to the
selective degradation group had missing data regarding perpetra-
tor gender; there was no additional information in the medical
forensic report to suggest that the offender was female, and
given that the overwhelming majority of SAKs received by the
state police forensic science division have male perpetrators, test-
ing proceeded as though these four offenders were male. Among
the SAKs associated with sexual assaults in which there were
multiple perpetrators, the assailants were exclusively male for all
but one SAK, which had missing data regarding assailant gen-
der; that kit had been randomly assigned to the standard testing
group, so the missing data regarding offender gender were not
problematic. With respect to race/ethnicity, most of the victims
and assailants were African American (80.0% and 88.9%,
respectively), consistent with the demographic composition of
Detroit. The victims were, on average, 23.04 years old at the
time of the assault, and the assailants were somewhat older
(M = 28.49 years old). The SAKs had been collected, on aver-
age, 6.55 years prior to the time they were selected for testing,
with a range of 4­11 years ago. Accounting for missing data,
21.1% of the assaults were committed by a stranger and 60.9%
were committed by someone known to the victim.
Procedures and Measures
We randomly assigned half of the SAKs to each DNA testing
method (0 = standard testing; 1 = selective degradation testing).
The state police outsourced forensic testing of the SAKs to a pri-
vate laboratory capable of performing selective degradation test-
ing methods. A site visit was conducted at the vendor laboratory
before shipment of the kits to ensure that testing procedures and
quality control processes met standards established by the state
police forensic science division.
Forensic testing is a multistage process whereby SAKs pass
on from one stage to the next only if they meet stage-specific
transition criteria (10,12); hence, the last stage of testing reached
by each SAK is an ordinal variable. We reorganized the data to
record a set of stage-specific binary outcome variables showing
whether each SAK continued to the next stage after it reached a
given stage (0 = no, 1 = yes). For this study, we focused on
FIG. 1­­Comparing standard and selective degradation DNA extraction methods. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

. SELECTIVE DEGRADATION DNA EXTRACTION 215
two specific transition points in this process. First, we computed
how many SAKs passed serology screening (i.e., the samples in
the kit contained bodily fluids that could be analyzed), which we
termed Stage 0, and proceeded to DNA testing, which we ter-
med Stage 1. The probability that a kit will proceed from Stage
0 to Stage 1 can be quantified as the DNA Testing Rate. We did
not expect a significant difference in the DNA testing rate
between the two testing conditions because what distinguishes
the two groups occurs during Stage 1, but we quantified and
compared this rate to verify that randomization to testing condi-
tion was successful.
For the SAKs randomly assigned to the standard DNA testing
condition, if semen was present via Christmas tree staining and
microscopic observation, the forensic scientist used a standard
differential extraction method to separate the sperm from the
nonsperm cells. For the SAKs in the selective degradation condi-
tion, if semen was present, the sample was chemically lysed,
separated by centrifugation, and the resulting sperm pellet treated
with a nuclease to purify the sperm. Once the sperm cells were
isolated, testing in both conditions proceeded per usual PCR-
STR methods. The DNA quantitation method used quantitative
PCR using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR instru-
ment and Promega's Plexor HY quantitation chemistry. The
short tandem repeat (STR) kit was Promega's PowerPlex 16HS
chemistry. If no semen was present, the kit testing was halted
and no further testing occurred regardless of group.
The second key transition point in the testing process that we
examined was whether the resulting DNA profile (whether
obtained by standard methods or selective degradation methods)
met minimum state requirements for completeness and eligibility
for entry into CODIS (Stage 2). The probability that a kit will
pass from Stage 1 to Stage 2 was quantified as the CODIS Entry
Rate. Comparing the CODIS entry rates between the two testing
conditions was the key focus of this study. We did not examine
whether those CODIS entries resulted in a CODIS hit (i.e.,
CODIS Hit Rate, Stage 3) because a hit depends on the match
between the contents of new CODIS entries and other records
already stored in CODIS (not on the method used to extract the
DNA). Any effect of testing method on the CODIS hit rate must
be mediated by either what is being entered into CODIS or what
was already present in CODIS.
The vendor laboratory completed stages 0 and 1 in the testing
process. Forensic scientists at that laboratory recorded whether
each SAK passed the serology screening, the presence of sperm
(0 = absent, 1 = present), the cost of consumable supplies (in
US dollars, including the costs of waste, controls, and reprocess-
ing), and laboratory personnel effort spent on testing and review-
ing test results (in hours). Then, state police forensic scientists
reviewed the results, entered eligible profiles into CODIS (Stage
2), and recorded CODIS entry outcomes and personnel effort
spent reviewing test results (in hours). The testing outcomes for
each SAK (whether it advanced from Stage 0 to Stage 1, then
from Stage 1 to Stage 2), the presence of sperm, and the staff
time and cost of consumable supplies required to test/review the
results were recorded and sent to the research team.
The cost and personnel effort data were sometimes recorded
as aggregate values for batches of multiple SAKs and other
times recorded separately for each SAK. This inconsistency in
the level of detail recorded requires that we aggregate these data
and present only descriptive summaries, as we are not aware of
any statistical method that can adequately quantify the sampling
variation expected around the estimates given the inconsistent
way the data were recorded.
Data Analytic Plan
We used continuation-ratio models (23,24) to quantify and
compare the forensic outcomes (i.e., DNA testing and CODIS
entry rates) as a function of DNA testing method. Continuation-
ratio models are an appropriate analytic choice for evaluating
sequential selection processes (23), which aligned well with our
focus on examining SAK progression through these two transi-
tion points (or stages) in the forensic testing process.
Our base model regressed stage-specific binary outcomes
showing whether a SAK continued passed each stage to reach
the next one (0 = no, 1 = yes) on main effects for stage and
DNA testing method, plus a stage times method interaction. The

DNA Testing Rate is an unconditional rate that reflects the pro-
portion of SAKs submitted for testing that passed serology
screening, indicating that there was sufficient biological evidence
present in the SAK to warrant DNA testing. By contrast, the
CODIS entry rate is a conditional rate that corresponds to the
proportion of SAKs that were actually tested (i.e., that passed
the screening at Stage 0) that yielded DNA profiles suitable for
upload into CODIS. Focusing on the conditional estimate
ensures that we have a clean comparison between the two DNA
testing methods under conditions where laboratory personnel
believe there is enough biological evidence present in the SAKs
that extracting an offender's DNA profile is actually possible.
In addition to reporting these rates, we also report odds ratios
(ORs), relative risks (RRs), and number needed to submit (NNS,
which is based on the number needed to treat [NNT]; (25,26) to
facilitate interpretation of the findings. Relative risk reflects how
much more often an event happens (e.g., a CODIS entry) for
one group (e.g., SAKs tested with selective degradation meth-
ods) relative to another group (e.g., SAKs tested with standard
methods). RR is computed by dividing the CODIS entry rate for
the selective degradation testing group by the CODIS entry rate
for standard group, which tells us how much more likely that
outcome (CODIS entry) is for the former group versus the latter.
The NNS is another useful index for understanding differential
rates between two groups. Larger absolute values of NNS indi-
cate that more SAKs would need to be submitted and tested to
obtain a one-unit difference between the groups; if it takes a
substantial number of SAKs to yield just a one-unit difference in
the focal outcome (e.g., CODIS-eligible profiles), then that sug-
gests the two groups are fairly similar and it may not make prac-
tical sense to treat them differentially.
Results from two separate analyses are presented below: (1) a
base model that omits covariates; and (2) a model that accounts
for a binary covariate, namely the presence of sperm in the
SAK, acting as a moderator of the testing method effect. In this
context, a moderator is a covariate that modifies how strongly a
focal predictor affects the outcome of interest. Here, we consider
the possibility that the testing method effect on DNA testing
rates and CODIS entry rate depends on whether sperm is present
in the SAK. The selective degradation testing method is
designed to work by selectively degrading DNA not contributed
by a sperm cell. Thus, it has the greatest potential to outperform
standard testing when sperm is present. It also has some poten-
tial to perform worse when sperm is not present because other
assailant DNA that is present may be degraded. Accounting for
this potential moderator may be important in understanding
when standard versus selective degradation testing may yield dif-
ferent results. To examine whether the testing method influences
forensic outcomes after we account for the presence or absence
of sperm, we extended the model to include a stage by testing
method by presence of sperm interaction effect, then looked at
the simple main effect of testing method on each rate separately
when sperm was absent and when it was present.
We also directly examined whether the two groups yield con-
ditional and unconditional CODIS entry rates that are function-
ally equivalent. Conventional statistical tests, such as the
continuation-ratio model, adopt a null hypothesis that there is no
difference between groups (i.e., their outcomes are exactly
equal). A nonsignificant finding from a conventional test yields
only an "absence of evidence" with respect to the hypothesis
that two groups have equivalent outcomes. Establishing that
groups have equivalent outcomes requires generating credible
"evidence of absence" with respect to group differences, which
is the purpose of equivalence tests. These statistical methods
adopt the null hypothesis that the outcomes for the groups are
not equivalent (i.e., the difference is large enough to be impor-
tant) (27­31). Only when the analysis provides strong evidence
refuting that assumption can we conclude that groups are equiva-
lent. Explicitly defining equivalence in advance is crucial for
these tests. When rates are expressed as proportions, the margin
of equivalence can be expressed as either an odds ratio or an
absolute risk reduction (ARR = pSD
ÀpS
) (28). We set the mar-
gin of equivalence for the ARR at 5% because feedback from
forensic science stakeholders (two at the state level and two at
the national level) suggested that CODIS entry rates for the two
groups that are within 5% of each other (À0.05 < ARR < 0.05)
would warrant considering the two DNA testing methods func-
tionally equivalent.
We analyzed the data with R 3.2.2 (32) and several R pack-
ages (33­40). All data, raw statistical output, and R code used to
obtain our results have been submitted for archiving in the
National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD) to promote
reproducible research.

Figure 2 shows the effect of DNA testing method on the test-
ing outcomes when we omit the potential moderator (presence of
sperm) from the model. The first panel shows that, as expected,
random assignment eliminated systematic differences with
respect to the presence of biological evidence (see supplemental
file for further interpretation of the difference in DNA testing
rates).

among SOL-unexpired detroit SAKs. The DNA testing rate is an uncondi-
tional estimate (the proportion of SAKs that pass the Stage 0 serology
screening to reach the actual DNA test at Stage 1). The CODIS entry rate is
a conditional estimate (the proportion of SAKs tested that yielded a DNA
profile suitable for upload into CODIS). These results generalize to the sub-
population of untested, SOL-unexpired Detroit SAKs (regardless of adjudica-
tion status or victim­offender relationship). After selecting N = 350 SAKs
from that subpopulation, n = 175 SAKs were randomly allocated to each of
the two testing methods. These estimates were obtained from a continuation-
ratio model of SAK progression across stages 0­2. The dots mark the esti-
mated rates; whiskers show corresponding 95% CIs. The odds ratios (OR)
and associated 95% CIs quantify the simple effect of testing method on the

CAMPBELL ET AL.
. SELECTIVE DEGRADATION DNA EXTRACTION 217
The conditional CODIS Entry Rate for SAKs in the standard
group was 80.8% (95% CI = [72.8, 86.9]), as compared to 76.8%
(95% CI = [68.5, 83.4]) in the selective degradation group (see
Table 2). The effect size is very small and nonsignificant
(OR = 0.78, 95% CI = [0.42, 1.46], p = 0.441). The RR = 0.95
(95% CI = [0.83, 1.07]) indicates that SAKs allocated to selective
degradation testing are about 0.95 times less likely to yield CODIS
entries than standard testing. Furthermore, the NNS = À24.79
(95% CI = [-87.64, 38.05]) means that testing about 25 SAKs
containing biological evidence via selective degradation testing
would likely yield one less CODIS entry than we would expect
from standard testing of a similar number SAKs containing biolog-
ical evidence (i.e., 19.04 vs. 20.04 CODIS entries).
The continuation-ratio model without the moderator term does
not offer strong evidence for a difference between testing meth-
ods, so we also computed an equivalence test to evaluate
whether the conditional CODIS entry rates are functionally
equivalent. The ARR = À4% was imprecisely estimated (90%
CI = [À12.6, 4.5]), with the lower bound of that CI falling far
outside the Æ5% margin of equivalence. So, CODIS entry rates
for the two groups are not equivalent because the rate yielded
by selective degradation testing may be more than 5% lower
than the rate yielded by standard testing.
We also examined results of the experiment in terms of
unconditional rates when we omit the potential moderator from
the model. Because our focus is on conditional CODIS entry
rates, we put Figure S1 (which contains the unconditional rates)
and interpretive comments in the supplemental file.
Conditional Rates for DNA Testing and CODIS Entry:
Moderator Included
Figure 3 shows the effect of testing method on the testing out-
comes when we include the presence of sperm as a moderator in
the model. The top panels show the results when sperm was
absent; the bottom panels show the results when sperm was pre-
sent. Comparing Figs 2 and 3 highlights the fact that each panel in
the former is essentially a weighted average of the top and bottom
panels from the latter (with weights based on the numbers of
SAKs with and without sperm). The first panel on each row shows
that accounting for the moderator does not alter the finding that
random assignment eliminated systematic differences with respect
to the presence of biological evidence (see supplemental file for
further interpretation of the difference in DNA testing rates).
When sperm was absent, the conditional CODIS Entry Rate
was 20.0% (95% CI = [05.0, 54.1]) for SAKs in the standard
test group and 33.3% (95% CI = [12.9, 62.8]) in the selective
degradation group (see Table 3). The wide confidence intervals
for these estimates (top right panel, Fig. 3) are likely due to the
low DNA testing rates, which effectively reduced the sample
size and increased the uncertainty surrounding the estimated pro-
portions and the corresponding effect size. Thus, although the
difference in the odds of a CODIS entry was nominally moder-
ate and nonsignificant (OR = 2.00, 95% CI = [0.28, 14.57],
p = 0.489), it could plausibly be substantially larger and favor
either group. There is far too much sampling variability to be
certain either way because the CI spans a range consistent with
a large negative effect to a very large positive effect. The
RR = 1.67 (95% CI = [0.0, 4.13]) indicates that when SAKs
containing biological evidence but no sperm are allocated to
selective degradation testing, they are about 1.67 times more
likely to yield CODIS entries than similar SAKs allocated to the
standard test. Furthermore, the NNS = 7.50 (95% CI = [À13.00,
28.00]) means that testing 7.50 SAKs containing biological evi-
dence but no sperm via selective degradation testing would
likely yield one more CODIS entry than we would expect from
standard testing of a similar number SAKs containing biological
evidence but no sperm (i.e., 2.50 vs. 1.50 CODIS entries).

218 JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES
Examining the difference in the conditional CODIS entry rates
(ARR) when sperm was absent reinforced the finding from the
difference test. The ARR = 13.3% lies above the upper end of
the Æ5% margin of equivalence and the 90% CI (À17.3, 43.9)
is so wide (due to estimating the rates from just 10-12 SAKs per
group) that it extends beyond the lower end of the equivalence
margin. This indicates that the rates are not equivalent because
the difference between them could be larger than 5% in either
direction when sperm are absent.
When sperm was present, the conditional CODIS Entry Rate
was 86.4% (95% CI = [78.5, 91.7]) for SAKs in the standard
test group and 81.4% (95% CI = [73.0, 87.6]) in the selective
degradation test group. This would be considered a small, statis-
tically nonsignificant, negative effect (OR = 0.69, 95%
CI = [0.33, 1.44], p = 0.317) on the odds of a CODIS entry that
could reflect nothing more than random sampling variation.
However, the wide CI for the OR is consistent with a range of
plausible effect sizes falling anywhere between a large negative
effect and a small positive one. The RR = 0.94 (95% CI = [0.83,
1.05]) indicates that SAKs allocated to selective degradation test-
ing are about 0.94 times less likely to yield CODIS entries than
SAKs allocated to the standard test. Furthermore, the
NNS = À20.21 (95% CI = [À59.55, 19.12]) means that testing
20.21 SAKs containing sperm via selective degradation testing
would likely yield one less CODIS entry than we would expect
from standard testing of a similar number SAKs containing
sperm (i.e., 16.46 vs. 17.46 CODIS entries).
The equivalence test directly examining the difference in con-
ditional CODIS entry rates also turned up an unusual result
when sperm was present. The observed ARR = À4.9% in favor
of standard testing lies right above the lower bound for the mar-
gin of equivalence. The 90% CI (À13.0, 3.1) therefore spans
that boundary with almost half of the interval on each side. This
means the rates are not equivalent. The two rates might differ by
less than 5% (indicating equivalence), but it is almost equally
plausible that standard testing yields a rate more than 5% higher
than that yielded by selective degradation testing.
The unconditional rates based on the model including the
potential moderator are shown in Figure S2. Because our focus
is on conditional CODIS entry rates, our interpretation of those
unconditional rates accompanies Figure S2 in the supplemental
file.
Comparisons of Testing Costs and Personnel Effort Between
Testing Methods
In this experiment, we also examined whether the two meth-
ods differ with respect to cost and personnel effort required.
Assuming equal performance with respect to forensic outcomes,
a testing method that costs less or enables personnel to work
more efficiently might be preferable. Table 4 summarizes cost of
consumable supplies used during testing, the amount of labora-
tory personnel time spent on testing and reviewing the results,
and the amount of state police forensic science division person-
nel time spent reviewing the DNA test results. There was little
difference in total cost of supplies ($16.20 total, $0.09 per SAK)
between the two methods, which could be entirely attributable to
the difference in costs at the Stage 0 screening.
The aggregate time spent by laboratory personnel on stan-
dard testing was 848.50 h, which was 192.50 more hours than
laboratory personnel spent on selective degradation testing
(656.00 h) for the same number of SAKs (N = 175 each).
Most of the difference was time spent on the actual testing
(181.75 h) rather than reviewing results (10.75 h). Laboratory
personnel spent an average of 4.85 h/SAK on standard DNA
testing; they spent an average of 3.75 h/SAK on selective
degradation testing. Therefore, selective degradation testing
method saved an average of 1.10 h/SAK in laboratory person-
nel time relative to standard testing. Cumulated across a large
collection of SAKs, this may yield substantial savings on per-
sonnel costs, but we cannot assess how much sampling varia-
tion one might expect in these estimates from the current
data. The true average time savings for laboratory personnel
could be higher or lower, but we cannot provide a valid CI
because the data were already partially aggregated when we
received them.
The aggregate difference in state police forensic science per-
sonnel time spent on reviewing test results was substantially
smaller (a total of 10.85 h). Reviewing results from standard
testing took state police forensic science division personnel a

Discussion of Findings
A growing body of research indicates that there are likely
hundreds of thousands of untested SAKs in police property facil-
ities throughout the United States (1,6). These kits could contain
useful, actionable information for law enforcement personnel and
prosecutors, so many communities with large numbers of
untested rape kits have elected to have all kits tested for DNA
(41). In addition, many U.S. states are passing laws requiring
that all SAKs be submitted for forensic testing (41­44). It will
be challenging for forensic laboratories to process older, previ-
ously untested SAKs, and maintain timely turnaround on current
case work. Decreasing testing time, without sacrificing testing
quality, is one of many strategies that could help meet this chal-
lenge. Emerging literature suggests that selective degradation
methods may offer a more efficient approach for DNA extrac-
tion, and initial efficacy studies indicate that the technique pro-
duces good quality STR profiles (7,8).
In this project, we looked further "downstream" in the pro-
cess of forensic testing to explore whether selective degradation
methods yielded comparable rates of CODIS-eligible DNA pro-
files compared to standard testing methods. Using actual case
work from a sample of previously unsubmitted SAKs in
Detroit, Michigan, we randomly assigned 350 kits to either
standard or selective degradation testing methods. We then
quantified and compared the forensic testing results with
respect to DNA testing rates and CODIS entry rates. The con-
tinuation-ratio model showed no significant differences between
the two groups, indicating that the selective degradation method
had no decrement in performance relative to customary meth-
ods. Follow-up equivalence tests, however, indicated that the
CODIS entry rates for the two methods could differ by more
than Æ5%, due to wide confidence intervals around the
estimates.
Taken together, these results are somewhat conflicting: The
significance test model showed no difference between the rates
of CODIS-eligible profiles for standard and selective degradation
methods, but the more rigorous test of equivalence could not
establish that the rates were statistically equivalent. Future stud-
ies should use larger samples because narrower confidence inter-
vals around the estimated difference between the CODIS entry
rates associated with standard and selective degradation DNA
testing methods will clarify whether these rates differ meaning-
fully, allowing researchers to discern more definitively whether
selective degradation performs at least as well as standard testing
with respect to CODIS entry rates. The data from this project
can help facilitate sample size planning required to obtain high
precision estimates (45,46). Our estimates were not precise
enough to determine unambiguously whether any differences in
CODIS entry rates between testing methods were small enough
to be substantively unimportant.
The findings of this study are clearer regarding the potential
practical utility of selective degradation methods. We computed
number-needed-to-submit (NNS) indices, which estimate how
many more SAKs would have to be tested to obtain a one-unit
difference between the groups. In this study, when sperm were
present, the NNS = À20.21, which was quite high and means
that we would need to test 20.21 SAKs via selective degradation
testing to observe a one-unit change in the number of CODIS
entries (one fewer CODIS entry). The practical advantages of
selective degradation were also evident in our cost analyses.
Materials costs were also similar across the two groups, but the
selective degradation method offered a substantial savings in
staffing time for interpretation/review: 1.10 h of laboratory per-
sonnel time per SAK relative to standard testing. Cumulated
across a large collection of SAKs, selective degradation testing
may yield substantial savings on personnel costs, but our results
merit replication in other laboratories/settings prior to broad-
based implementation.
Study Limitations
It is important to note several limitations of this study that
temper the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn from
this work. First, it is worth reiterating that selective degrada-
tion methods are not appropriate for female-perpetrated
assaults, but given that national epidemiological data indicate
that the vast majority of sexual assaults are committed by
males (1,6), this testing method could be viable for most--but
certainly not all--SAK casework. Second, selective degrada-
tion has the potential for automation, which was not used in
this experiment; thus, the potential time savings of this
method are underestimated in this study. Replication of these
findings with automation would provide more sensitive data
regarding potential time savings offered by selective degrada-
tion. Finally, the focus of this study was not the quality of
the STR profiles generated by selective degradation (7,8), but
rather, whether there are potential "downstream" differences in
the number of CODIS-eligible profiles. We did not explore
how these testing results were utilized by criminal justice
practitioners in the investigation and prosecution of the cases
associated with these SAKs. As such, we do not know
whether there were (or will be) any legal challenges to this
testing method, which was beyond the scope of this study,
but clearly merits examination in future research.
Conclusions
With these caveats in mind, this study was the first large-scale
evaluation of selective degradation testing methods with actual
SAK casework. Our findings indicate that this method could
offer forensic laboratories substantial time savings as a more
efficient method for DNA extraction.
Compared to standard testing methods, selective degradation
did not produce a significantly higher or lower number of
CODIS-eligible DNA profiles, but additional studies are needed
because our results were equivocal as to whether the rates were
in fact statistically equivalent between the two groups. Addi-
tional studies that evaluate both the quality of the STR profiles
and the downstream utility and utilization of DNA profiles
obtained through selective degradation are needed.
