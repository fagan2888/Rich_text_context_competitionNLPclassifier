Abstract
The HIV glycoprotein gp120, a neurotoxic HIV glycoprotein that is overproduced and shed by HIV-infected macrophages, is
associated with neurological complications of HIV such as distal sensory polyneuropathy, but interactions of gp120 in the
peripheral nervous system remain to be characterized. Here, we demonstrate internalization of extracellular gp120 in a
manner partially independent of binding to its coreceptor CXCR4 by F11 neuroblastoma cells and cultured dorsal root
ganglion neurons. Immunocytochemical and pharmacological experiments indicate that gp120 does not undergo trafficking
through the endolysosomal pathway. Instead, gp120 is mainly internalized through lipid rafts in a cholesterol-dependent
manner, with a minor fraction being internalized by fluid phase pinocytosis. Experiments using compartmentalized micro-
fluidic chambers further indicate that, after internalization, endocytosed gp120 selectively undergoes retrograde but not
anterograde axonal transport from axons to neuronal cell bodies. Collectively, these studies illuminate mechanisms of gp120
internalization and axonal transport in peripheral nervous system neurons, providing a novel framework for mechanisms for
gp120 neurotoxicity.

Introduction
The HIV glycoprotein gp120 is a neurotoxic viral protein
that is overproduced and shed during HIV infection
(Schneider et al., 1986). Infected macrophages are thought
to damage sensory neurons indirectly by producing neuro-
toxic factors including cytokines, excitatory amino acids,
and shed viral proteins (Kaul et al., 2005). Several lines of
evidence link gp120 to neurological complications of HIV,
such as distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP; Ellis et al.,
2010; Evans et al., 2011; Anziska et al., 2012). Notably,
transgenic expression of gp120 in mice suffices to produce
dying back neuronal pathology (Toggas et al., 1994;
Michaud et al., 2001). Additionally, infected macrophages
infiltrate dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), promoting a higher
local concentration of gp120 around the DRG neurons
(Laast et al., 2011), and administration of recombinant
gp120 to rodents causes pain hypersensitivity, a common
DSP symptom (Milligan et al., 2000; Herzberg and Sagen,
2001). Gp120 can directly bind to its coreceptors CXCR4
and CCR5 on the surface of DRG neurons (Apostolski
et al., 1993; Oh et al., 2001), with CXCR4 being
more clearly linked to neurotoxicity than CCR5 (Kaul
et al., 2005). Consequently, T-tropic strains of gp120
that bind to CXCR4, as opposed to M-tropic strains
of gp120 that bind to CCR5, are more commonly utilized
to study gp120 neurotoxicity.
Recently, gp120 was reported to be internalized by
neurons of the central nervous system (CNS; Bachis
et al., 2003, 2006), raising the possibility that intracellular
gp120 might also be harmful to neurons. However,
pathways by which gp120 may be internalized have not
been identified. An understanding of how gp120 enters
neurons and how sensory neurons respond to viral pro-
tein entry could lead to an enhanced knowledge of

mechanisms underlying gp120 neurotoxicity. In this con-
text, identifying pathways for gp120 internalization
would aid in development of novel therapeutic strategies
either by preventing gp120 entry into sensory neurons or
blocking downstream signaling pathways.
Major pathways that are candidates for gp120 intern-
alization include the common endosomal pathway, which
utilizes clathrin-mediated endocytosis; fluid phase pino-
cytosis in which endosomes are nonspecifically taken up
by the cell along with extracellular fluid; and lipid raft
internalization. Lipid rafts are cholesterol-enriched, dis-
crete microdomains within the plasma membrane that
act as signal transduction platforms and mediate cla-
thrin-independent internalization. Several viruses utilize
lipid rafts to mediate entry into cells (Chazal and
Gerlier, 2003; Suzuki and Suzuki, 2006), including
HIV (Chazal and Gerlier, 2003). Accordingly, gp120 clus-
ters with its coreceptors in lipid rafts to allow virus intern-
alization (Manes et al., 2000; Liao et al., 2001; Popik et al.,
2002), making lipid rafts likely sites for gp120 entry.
Neurons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) are
remarkably polarized, with axons reaching up to a meter
or more in length in some cases. This unique cellular
architecture renders these cells highly dependent on
microtubule motor-dependent fast axonal transport
mechanisms for trafficking of proteins and cellular com-
ponents within axons (Morfini et al., 2009). Certain
viruses, including herpes simplex virus and adenoviruses,
have the capability to hijack specific components of the
host's fast axonal transport machinery (i.e., molecular
motors and vesicle-associated proteins), allowing their
intracellular movement (Berth et al., 2009). Transport
of gp120 itself has been reported in the CNS but not in
PNS axons (Ahmed et al., 2009).
The aims of this study were to determine whether
gp120 is subject to internalization by PNS sensory neu-
rons, to identify specific uptake pathways involved, and
to evaluate whether gp120 is transported along axons.
Our findings indicate that gp120 is mainly internalized
through lipid rafts, with a minor fraction internalized
through fluid phase pinocytosis. Additionally, gp120
was retrogradely transported from axons to the cell
bodies in a time frame indicating fast axonal transport.
The demonstration of intracellular internalization for
gp120 in DRG neurons raises the possibility of intracel-
lular neurotoxic effects of gp120.
Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
F11 cells (a generous gift from Dr. Richard Miller) were
grown in high glucose DMEM media (Invitrogen), sup-
plemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% glu-
tamax, and 10,000 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin.
Six-channel m-slides from Ibidi (#80606) were coated
with 0.1 mg/ml poly-L-lysine (Sigma) and then rinsed 4
times (30 min each) with autoclaved, deionized water.
Then, 300 cells were added to each channel and main-
tained at 37C in 5% CO2
and 95% O2
. To differentiate
F11 cells, the amount of FBS was first reduced to 5% for
24 hr, and cells were treated with 0.5 mM dibutryl-cAMP
(Sigma) in media with 0.5% FBS for 4 days.
Antibodies and Reagents
The following antibodies were used: DM1A (Sigma),
CXCR4 (Abcam #ab2074), EEA1 (Cell Signaling
#3288), and LAMP-2 (Thermo Scientific #PA1-655).
Recombinant gp120 IIIB and fluorescein-conjugated
recombinant gp120 IIIB were purchased from
Immunodiagnostics (#1001 and #1001-F, respectively).
Gp120 BaL and AMD3100 (AMD) were obtained from
the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and
Reference Reagent Program. Rhodamine-dextran
(10,000 MW), Alexa Fluor 594-cholera toxin B, and
Alexa Fluor-transferrin were purchased from Invitrogen.
The HRP-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody
was purchased from Jackson. Methyl-b-cyclodextrin (CD)
was purchased from Sigma.
Cell Lysates
F11 cells were differentiated in 100 mm Petri dishes.
After 4 days of 0.5 mM dibutryl-cAMP (Sigma) treat-
ment, cells were scraped and collected in 700 mL lysis
buffer (1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS] in phosphate-
buffered saline [PBS], pH 7.4) and sonicated for
two short, 3-s bursts each. Cells were spun at
14,000 rpm at 4C in a Beckman tabletop centrifuge.
Protein concentration of the clarified supernatants was
determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA
assay) kit (Pierce). Sample buffer was added to the clar-
ified supernatants, and the samples were placed in the
À20C freezer prior to analysis via SDS-PAGE.
Immunoblots
Protein samples were loaded onto a 4% to 12% bis/tris
gradient gel (Invitrogen). Proteins from the gels were
transferred (at 4C) to Immobilon-P transfer membranes
(PVDF, Millipore) at 0.4 Amps for 2 hr in 1Â Towbin
buffer. Membranes were blocked at room temperature for
120 min with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS).
Primary antibody (Abcam #2074) in 1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) was added overnight at 4C with gentle
rocking. The primary antibody was washed 3 Â 10 min
with TBST (0.1% Tween), and the secondary antibody
was added for 1 hr at 4C with gentle rocking.
Membranes were again washed 3 Â 10 min and visualized

Treatment of Cells
Differentiated F11 cells were treated with fluorescein-con-
jugated gp120 IIIB for several time points. For heat
inactivation, gp120 IIIB was boiled for 1 hr prior to treat-
ing F11 cells. For experiments in Figure 2, F11 cells were
preincubated with 2 mM AMD for 1 hr and then
cotreated with 2 mM AMD and 70 nM (8.3 mg/ml) fluor-
escein-gp120 for a 2-hr time course. For CD pretreatment
experiments, F11 cells were incubated with 5 mM CD for
20 min, washed 3 times with media, and then incubated
with 70 nM fluorescein-gp120 for a 2-hr time course. To
examine the effect of CD pretreatment on transferrin
internalization, differentiated F11 cells were treated
with either 5 mM CD or washed with media for 20 min
at 37C, incubated with 50 mg/ml transferrin on ice for 15
min, and then washed and incubated at 37C for 15 min.
For colocalization analysis with dextran, F11 cells were
cotreated with 70 nM gp120 and 200 mg/ml dextran for a
2-hr time course. To examine colocalization between
gp120 and cholera toxin B, differentiated F11 cells were
first incubated with 500 ng/ml cholera toxin B on ice for
15 min, washed, and then incubated with 70 nM fluores-
cein-gp120 at 37C for a 2-hr time course. Cells were then
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.01% glutaralde-
hyde in PBS for 10 min and quenched with 50 mM
ammonium chloride in PBS for 5 min. Mounting media
with the nuclear dye DAPI (Vectashield) was dropped
into wells.
Immunocytochemistry
All steps were carried at room temperature, unless indi-
cated. DM1A (anti-alpha tubulin) antibody was used to
visualize F11 cells and their neurites, or DRG neurons
and their axons. For immunostaining with DM1A, fixed
F11 cells were permeabilized with 0.1% triton-X-100 for
10 min and then blocked with 5% fat-free milk in PBS for
1 hr. Cells were incubated with DM1A antibody at room
temperature for 1 hr. For immunostaining with CXCR4
antibody, fixed F11 cells were permeabilized with 0.1%
triton-X-100 for 10 min and then blocked with 1%
BSA in PBS for 1 hr. Cells were incubated with
CXCR4 antibody at room temperature for 1 hr. For
immunostaining using EEA1 and LAMP2 antibodies,
F11 cells were permeabilized with 0.25% triton-X-100
in PBS for 1 hr and blocked with 5% normal goat
serum (Santa Cruz). Cells were incubated with primary
antibodies for 1 hr, washed, and incubated with Alexa
Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hr at
room temperature. Mounting media with DAPI
(Vectashield) was dropped into wells.
Fluorescence Imaging and Quantitation
Cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta laser
scanning confocal microscope with a 100Â objective.
One-micrometer-thick z-stacks were obtained, and at
least 10 cells per experimental condition were analyzed
for each time point. Z-stacks excluded the slices in
which the upper and lower boundaries of the cells were
in focus, to ensure that the z-stacks were only composed
of intracellular slices. For the CXCR4 image, a 40Â
objective was used to show multiple cells.
Images were deconvolved and analyzed in three
dimensions using Volocity software (Perkin Elmer).
Three-dimensional reconstructions and movies were cre-
ated in Volocity (Supplemental Figures 1 to 3). For
internalization assays, the average fluorescence units
were calculated for each region of interest (ROI) obtained
from each cell traced. For colocalization analysis, the
Pearson's correlation coefficient, which calculates the cor-
relation between intensities of different channels, was
obtained for each cell. To provide quantitative colocali-
zation of immunofluorescent signals, colocalization coef-
ficients M1 and M2 were obtained for the green and red
channels respectively which calculate the fraction of each
channel that overlapped with the other channel (Manders
et al., 1993). For quantitation of gp120 internalization,
Student's t test and Spearman's correlation were used for
statistical analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
utilized to compare amounts of gp120 internalization
between treatments of gp120 alone, heat inactivated
gp120, and AMD pretreatments. Student's t test was
used to examine decreases in gp120 internalization after
CD treatment for 30 min, 1 hr, and 2 hr time points.
Quantitative data were expressed as mean Æ SEM, and
significance was determined at p < .05.
Microfluidic Devices
Custom microfluidic chambers were produced to com-
partmentalize axonal terminal and somatodendritic com-
partments (ATC and SDC, respectively) of cultured
neurons. Nanofabricated microchannels separating
these compartments are small enough (length of 900 mm
and a width of 8 mm) that only axons can grow through.
Fluidic isolation of a compartment is maintained by
volume differences of 200 ml, as well as through a perpen-
dicular central channel 23 mm long and 50 mm wide, so
that the pressure gradient overcomes diffusion.
Microfluidic chambers were fabricated using photolithog-
raphy and replica molding techniques. Briefly, patterned
layers of PDMS were exposed to plasma generated by a
laboratory corona treater (BD-20AC; Electro-Technic
Products, Inc., Chicago, IL), as were glass coverslips.
The plasma-treated surfaces were then immediately
placed in conformal contact, and incubation of the
Berth et al. 3
whole setup at 80C overnight resulted in irreversible
bonding. ATC and SDC were loaded with 70% etha-
nol for 30 min, rinsed with autoclaved water 4 times,
and if needed, treated with 0.1% tritonX-100 in PBS to
remove bubbles from the microchannels. After this,
devices were washed with autoclaved water 3 times for
5 min each.
Microfluidic devices were incubated overnight with
0.5 mg/ml poly-L-lysine (Sigma) in 0.1 M borate buffer
pH 8.5 and then washed with autoclaved water 4 times
for 30 min each. Devices were incubated overnight
with 10 mg/ml laminin (Invitrogen) in Neurobasal
media (Invitrogen) at 37C prior to plating the DRG
neurons.
Primary DRG Neuron Cell Culture
All experiments involving animals were conducted
according to protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at University of
Illinois at Chicago. E15 DRG neurons were dissected
from embryos obtained from timed pregnant Sprague-
Dawley rats, as described in Hall et al. (2006), and
placed into ice-cold 1Â Hank's balanced salt solution.
Trypsin was added to 0.25%, and the cells were incubated
at 37C. Trypsin was inactivated by adding 10% FBS,
and cells were collected by centrifugation (600 Â g for 6
min). Cells were resuspended in serum-free Neurobasal
media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B27
(Invitrogen), 1% Glutamax (Invitrogen), 0.5% penicil-
lin/streptomycin (10,000 U/ml each, Invitrogen), and
2.5 S nerve growth factor (NGF; 20 ng/ml, Invitrogen).
Cells (90,000) were added to the SDC of the prepared
microfluidic devices (30,000 cells per SDC compartment),
and microfluidic flow was from SDC to ATC. Within the
ATC, 2.5 S NGF was added at 50 ng/ml concentration, to
maintain an NGF gradient that attracts DRG axons into
the ATCs. Half of the cell media was replaced with fresh
media every other day. 5-Fluoro-20-dexyuridine (FudR;
10 mm) was added to the cell media every other time the
media was replaced to eliminate nonneuronal cells.
Results
Time Course of gp120 Internalization by F11 Cells
The neurotoxicity of gp120 was commonly thought to
result from binding to its coreceptor CXCR4 at the
plasma membrane and abnormal activation of signaling
pathways (Kaul et al., 2005), but internalization of gp120
by some neurons of the CNS was recently demonstrated
(Bachis et al., 2003, 2006). However, the pathway for this
internalization and gp120 uptake by sensory neurons, the
main neuronal type affected in DSP, has not been estab-
lished. Examining gp120 internalization by sensory
neurons could illuminate mechanisms for sensory
neuron-specific responses to gp120, providing novel
insights into DSP pathogenesis. To address this issue,
we evaluated gp120 internalization in F11 cells differen-
tiated with dibutryl-cAMP, which are rat DRG neurons
hybridized with mouse neuroblastoma cells (Ghil et al.,
2000). F11 cells were chosen for these experiments due to
their similarity to DRG neurons. Their ability to prolif-
erate and differentiate avoids the heterogeneity of neur-
onal cell type characteristic of DRG primary cultures
(Francel et al., 1987; Shastry et al., 2001). This is import-
ant to avoid any indirect effects of gp120 treatment

through its interactions with nonneuronal cells. To follow
uptake and internalization, fluorescein-conjugated gp120
IIIB (70 nM) was added to the culture media. Z-stack
images obtained by confocal microscopy demonstrated
accumulation of gp120 within cells after 2 hr of incuba-
tion (Figure 1(a) to (c), Supplemental Figures 1 to 3). A
time-course study (Figure 2(a) to (e)) further indicated
that internalization of gp120 by F11 cells was detectable
as early as 15 min (Figure 2(b)) and continued to increase
for more than 2 hr (Figure 2(e)). The gp120 was first seen
to be localized along neuritic processes (not shown) and
at cell bodies, with accumulation in the perinuclear region
of the cell bodies at later time points, raising the possi-
bility that this protein may undergo retrograde axonal
transport (see later). A Student's two-tailed t test revealed
that the amount of gp120-derived average fluorescence
was significantly increased after 15 min of treatment
(p < .0001) and continued to increase for the duration
of the treatment (Figure 2(f)). A Spearman's correlation
analysis confirmed that gp120 internalization increased
over time (p < .001).
Gp120 Internalization Is Specific and Partially
Dependent on Binding to CXCR4
To evaluate whether gp120 internalization was specific to
its biological activity, fluorescein-gp120 was heat inacti-
vated by boiling for 1 hr before addition to F11 cells.
Internalization of gp120 (Figure 3(a)) over the course of
2 hr was completely abrogated by heat inactivation of
gp120 (Figure 3(b)), demonstrating that internalization
of gp120 by F11 cells required native protein conform-
ation. Because T-tropic gp120 binds to its coreceptor
CXCR4 on DRG neurons (Apostolski et al., 1993; Oh
et al., 2001), the necessity of this binding for internaliza-
tion was evaluated. Immunocytochemistry experiments
(Figure 3(d)) and immunoblots (Figure 3(e)) confirmed
the presence of CXCR4 in F11 cells. F11 cells were
pretreated for an hour with 2 mM AMD, a small molecule
inhibitor of gp120 binding to CXCR4 (De Clercq et al.,
1994; Donzella et al., 1998), and then a time course
experiment was performed cotreating cells with
Figure 2. Time course of gp120 internalization by F11 cells. F11 cells were treated with fluorescein-gp120 (green) for 0 (a), 15 (b), 30 (c),
60 (d), and 120 min (e). Arrows in (b) and (c) point to fluorescein-gp120 accumulated at the cell membrane and neuritic processes. By 30
min, gp120 begins to accumulate in perinuclear areas of the cell (c), with the amount of perinuclear gp120 increasing at later time points (d)
and (e). Scale bar: 10 mm. The morphology of cells was revealed using an anti-tubulin antibody (red). (f) Average gp120-derived fluores-
cence was calculated for 10 or more cells and box plots generated for each time point (see Materials and Methods section). Intracellular
gp120 fluorescence significantly increased by 15 min of treatment (*p <.0001), and continued to increase for the duration of the treatment,
showing signs of saturation at the 2-hr time point.

fluorescein-gp120 and AMD. Significantly, treatment of
F11 cells with AMD markedly reduced the amount
of internalized gp120 (Figure 3(c)) compared with
untreated cells (Figure 3(a)), but not to the same extent
as heat-inactivated fluorescein-gp120 Figure 3(b)). This
concentration of AMD was sufficient to abolish signaling
through the CXCR4 receptor (data not shown).
A one-way ANOVA was performed to determine dif-
ferences in the amounts of gp120 internalized between the
gp120 alone group, the heat-inactivated gp120 group, and
the AMD treated group (Figure 3(e) and (f)). The groups
were found to be significantly different (p < .0001).
Further, all experimental groups were significantly
different from each other (p < .0001 for each comparison)
using a Tukey­Kramer test. These data indicate that
gp120 binding to CXCR4 is necessary for some, but
not all of the gp120 internalized by F11 cells.
Mechanisms of gp120 Internalization
The highly punctate intracellular staining of fluorescein-
conjugated gp120 (Figure 1) suggested internalization
through an endocytic mechanism. To evaluate this possi-
bility, F11 cells were treated with fluorescein-conjugated
gp120 for a time course more than 4 hr and then stained
with antibodies recognizing markers of the early (EEA1)
Figure 3. Gp120 internalization is abolished by heat inactivation and reduced by AMD3100. F11 cells were treated with (a) fluorescein-
gp120, (b) heat-inactivated (h.i.) gp120, or (c) pretreated with 2 mm AMD3100 (AMD; an inhibitor of gp120 binding to CXCR4) for 1 hr
before the addition of fluorescein-gp120. Heat inactivation prevented internalization of fluorescein-gp120 by F11 cells, demonstrating that
internalization is specific to the native protein conformation of gp120. Also, AMD3100 treatment reduced gp120 internalization,
demonstrating that internalization of gp120 is partially dependent on binding to CXCR4, a normal biological activity. However, the partial
reduction of internalization indicates that gp120 can also be internalized through a mechanism independent of CXCR4. The morphology of
cells was revealed using an anti-tubulin antibody (red). (d) F11 cells immunostained with a CXCR4 antibody demonstrate the presence of
CXCR4 on the surface of the cells. Scale bar: 10 mm. (e) Immunoblot confirms the presence of CXCR4 in F11 cells. C indicates the

and late (LAMP2) endosomal/lysosomal compartments.
Colocalization of internalized gp120 with these
markers was evaluated using the Pearson's correlation
coefficient along with the colocalization coefficients M1
and M2 (see Fluorescence Imaging and Quantitation sec-
tion). Significantly, gp120 failed to colocalize with either
EEA1 (Figure 4) or LAMP2 (Figure 5) throughout the
entire time course of the experiments, ruling out intern-
alization through the common endolysosomal pathway.
Next, fluid phase pinocytosis was assessed as a
mechanism for gp120 internalization. To this end, differ-
entiated F11 cells were simultaneously treated with fluor-
escein-gp120 and rhodamine-conjugated dextran (MW
10,000), a well-known marker of fluid phase pinocytosis
(Frost et al., 2009). Partial colocalization between gp120
and dextran was observed (Figure 6), suggesting that at
least a fraction of extracellular gp120 is internalized into
F11 cells through fluid phase pinocytosis.
Because gp120 did not enter the cell through the
common endolysosomal pathway and fluid phase
pinocytosis only accounted for a minor fraction of total
gp120 internalized, we considered that gp120 might also
be internalized through lipid raft-mediated endocytosis,
another non-clathrin-mediated process (Lajoie and Nabi,
2010). Gp120 and its receptors are known to cluster in
lipid rafts (Popik et al., 2002), and this clustering is crit-
ical for HIV infection (Kamiyama et al., 2009).
Consistent with this possibility, significant colocalization
was observed between internalized fluorescein-gp120 and
cholera toxin B (Figure 7). To further evaluate the role of
lipid rafts for gp120 internalization, differentiated F11
cells were treated with 5 mM CD for 20 min to deplete
cholesterol and inhibit lipid raft internalization. Next
fluorescein-gp120 was added to media, and gp120 intern-
alization quantified. Comparing untreated cells (Figure
8(a)) with F11 cells pretreated with CD (Figure 8(b))
indicated that CD pretreatment significantly decreased
the amount of internalized gp120 at 30, 60, and 120
min time points (Figure 8(b) to (d)), and the differences
were significant at p < .05 using a Student's two-tailed
Figure 4. Gp120 does not colocalize with EEA1. A time course of fluorescein-gp120 internalization by F11 cells was performed, and cells
were stained with an antibody for EEA1, a marker of early endosomes within the common endosomal pathway. Representative images of an
F11 cell treated for 2 hr show fluorescein-gp120 (a, green), EEA1 immunoreactivity (b, red), and both gp120 and EEA1 (c) Scale bar: 10 mm.
Z-stacks were taken of at least 10 cells per time point on a laser scanning confocal microscope, and images were deconvolved and analyzed
for colocalization in Volocity. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (d), colocalization coefficient M1 (green channel; e) and colocalization
coefficient M2 (red channel; f) all show very low values, consistent with lack of co-localization for fluorescein-gp120 and EEA1. This
indicates that gp120 is not significantly internalized through the common endosomal pathway.

t test (*), a finding consistent with results from colocali-
zation experiments in Figure 7. In concurrent experi-
ments, treatment of F11 cells with CD did not decrease
the amount of internalized transferrin (Figure 8(e)),
demonstrating that the inhibitory effect of CD on
gp120 internalization was specific to lipid raft-mediated,
but not clathrin-mediated, endocytosis. Taken together,
these experiments indicated that lipid raft-mediated endo-
cytosis represents a major pathway for gp120 internaliza-
tion by sensory neurons.
Recombinant gp120 Is Transported Retrogradely,
but Not Anterogradely, Along DRG Axons
A number of viruses and viral proteins have the capabil-
ity to highjack various components of the host's axonal
transport machinery and be transported to different
intracellular compartments (Berth et al., 2009). Having
established internalization of gp120 by F11 cells, we
examined internalization and axonal transport of gp120
in cultured DRG neurons using compartmentalized
microfluidic devices, which allow for isolation of SDC
and ATC. All axons have the same polarity and are in
register, so directionality of transport can be evaluated in
the axons. The diameter of nanofabricated microgrooves
that separate the SDC and ATC prevents dendrites or cell
bodies from growing into the ATC. Primary DRG neu-
rons bearing differentiated axons are more suited for
these devices than F11 cells, so rat primary DRG neurons
were utilized for these experiments to directly evaluate
axonal trafficking.
Primary DRG neurons were grown in the SDC com-
partment with a larger volume of media in the SDC to
isolate the cell bodies and dendrites fluidically from the
ATC. After this, 70 nM fluorescein-gp120 was added to
the ATC of mature DRG neurons for 4 hr (Figure 9(a),
diagram on left). Neurons were then fixed and stained
with the DM1A antibody. Gp120 in the ATC, microflui-
dic channels, and SDC was evaluated by fluorescence
microscopy. As shown in Figure 9(a), fluorescein-gp120
was found at the ATC, along axons in the microfluidic
channels, and within cell bodies in the SDC, thus demon-
strating that gp120 had been internalized and retro-
gradely transported along axons into neuronal cell
bodies. Further, the time course of the experiment indi-
cates that gp120 was transported by fast, and not slow,
axonal transport, a microtubule motor-dependent pro-
cess (Morfini et al., 2012). Next, anterograde transport

The Pearson's correlation coefficient (d), colocalization coefficient M1 (green channel; e), and colocalization coefficient M2 (red channel; f)
all show very low values, demonstrating that fluorescein-gp120 does not colocalize with LAMP2. Because LAMP2 is a marker of lysosomes
in the common endosomal pathway, this indicates that gp120 is not internalized through the common endosomal pathway.

was examined by growing DRG neurons in devices in
which the ATC was maintained with a larger volume of
media than the SDC to fluidically isolate the ATC
(Figure 9(b), diagram on left). The SDC was treated
with 70 nM fluorescein-gp120 for 4 hr. As shown in
Figure 9(b), fluorescent microscopy demonstrated that
the microfluidic channels and ATC lacked fluorescein-
gp120, indicating that recombinant gp120 does not
undergo anterograde axonal transport in DRG neurons.
Discussion
Combination antiretroviral treatment has dramatically
improved HIV patient mortality and decreased a
number of HIV complications (Greene, 2007; Clifford,
2008). However, the prevalence of DSP continues una-
bated (Ghosh et al., 2012), making this an important
disease complication that still requires treatment.
Because HIV does not productively infect neurons
(An,Groves, Giometto, Beckett, & Scaravilli, 1999), the
mechanism for HIV-induced peripheral nerve damage is
believed to involve indirect mechanisms. These include
neurotoxicity by secretion of inflammatory factors, cyto-
kines, and shed viral proteins such as gp120 (Kaul et al.,
2005). The persistence of DSP despite tight viral control
by combination antiretroviral therapy may be due to
latently infected cells that produce and release viral pro-
teins (Nath, 2002) or low levels of HIV replication lead-
ing to gp120 shedding from HIV particles or from
infected macrophages (Kranick and Nath, 2012). Gp120
binds to its coreceptor CXCR4 at the plasma membrane
of DRG neurons leading to activation of downstream
signaling cascades (Apostolski et al., 1993). One proposal
is that aberrant activation of this pathway might produce
the pain hypersensitivity (Oh et al., 2001; Bhangoo et al.,
2009), axonal degeneration, and apoptosis (Melli et al.,
2006) characteristic of DSP. However, recent experiments

coefficient M2 (red channel; f) all show values indicative of partial colocalization between gp120 and dextran. Because dextran is a marker
of fluid phase pinocytosis, this demonstrates that a component of gp120 is internalized through fluid phase pinocytosis.

neurons raised the possibility that intracellular gp120
might contribute to DSP pathogenesis (Bachis et al.,
2003, 2006). However, whether sensory neurons affected
in DSP are capable of internalizing gp120 and how inter-
nalized gp120 might contribute to neurotoxicity was
unclear.
Here we demonstrate that both F11 cells and primary
DRG rat neurons internalized gp120 in a time-dependent
manner. Quantitative imaging showed accumulation of
gp120 in the perinuclear region over time that began
to level off after 2 hr of incubation with recombinant
gp120 in the culture media. The highly punctate nature
of intracellular gp120-derived fluorescence was consist-
ent with that reported for other cell types (Cefai et al.,
1992), including CNS neurons (Bachis et al., 2003).
Additionally, heat inactivation and AMD pretreatment
experiments demonstrated that gp120 internalization
was specific to its biological activity and dependent
upon native protein conformation.
Pharmacological experiments with the inhibitor AMD
indicated that gp120 internalization was partially
dependent on binding to its coreceptor CXCR4 but did
not reveal the pathway for internalization. Extracellular
gp120 was previously reported to cause neurotoxicity
through aberrant activation of CXCR4-linked signaling
cascades (Oh et al., 2001; Trushin et al., 2007). However,
our results show that gp120 can be internalized, raising
the possibility that intra-neuronal gp120 contributes to
sensory neuron toxicity. Binding of gp120 to CXCR4
might represent an initial step for gp120 internalization.
Colocalization studies with markers of different endo-
somal pathways helped define pathways for gp120 intern-
alization. Lack of colocalization with EEA1 and LAMP2
demonstrated that gp120 is not significantly internalized
through the common endolysosomal pathway. Rather,
colocalization analysis of gp120 with cholera toxin B
and with dextran indicated that the bulk of extracellular
gp120 was internalized through lipid rafts, with a minor
fraction being internalized through fluid phase pinocyt-
osis. Accordingly, disrupting lipid rafts through CD
treatment greatly decreased the amount of internalized
gp120. This observation was consistent with previous
Figure 7. Gp120 substantially colocalizes with cholera toxin B. F11 cells were cotreated with fluorescein-gp120 (green) and Alexa Fluor
594-cholera toxin B (CTxB, red), and a time course of internalization was performed. The scale bar denotes 10 mm. A representative image
of a F11 cell treated for 2 hr is shown in (a) to (c). Note the colocalization in (c) between green and red channels. Arrows in (c) point to
colocalized puncta. Z-stacks were taken of at least 10 cells per time point on a laser scanning confocal microscope, and images were
deconvolved and analyzed for colocalization in Volocity. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (d), colocalization coefficient M1 (green
channel; e), and colocalization coefficient M2 (red channel; f) all show values indicative of colocalization between gp120 and cholera toxin B,
especially by 2 hr treatment. Because cholera toxin B is a marker of internalization through lipid rafts, this indicates that gp120 is also
internalized through lipid rafts.

tors within lipid rafts is crucial for HIV infection (Manes
et al., 2000; Liao et al., 2001; Popik et al., 2002).
Moreover, gp120 was reported to induce CXCR4
movement into lipid rafts for HIV entry (Kamiyama
et al., 2009). Based on these results, the major pathway
for internalization of gp120 appears to require binding to
CXCR4 in association with lipid rafts. Gp120 has been

20 min to disrupt lipid rafts, and then a time course of internalization of fluorescein-gp120 was performed. Scale bar: 10 mm. Representative
images of cells treated with fluorescein-gp120 for 2 hr without CD (a) or with CD pretreatment are shown (b). The morphology of cells
was revealed using an anti-tubulin antibody (red). Note the reduced amount of internalized gp120 in CD-treated cells (b), compared with
untreated ones (a). Average gp120-derived fluorescence was calculated for 10 or more cells. As shown in (c), pretreatment with 5 mM
cyclodextrin for 20 min reduced the amount of internalized gp120 (gray line), compared with control cells (black line). Each measurement
is plotted in (c), with gray and black dots corresponding to pretreatment with CD or no pretreatment, respectively. (d) Box plots
demonstrate that internalization of gp120 was significantly reduced at the 30, 60, and 120 min time points, consistent with internalization of
gp120 through lipid rafts. *p <.05. (e) Pretreatment of differentiated F11 cells with 5 mM cyclodextrin for 20 min did not significantly affect

reported to cointernalize with CXCR4 in T-cells (Misse
et al., 1999), but internalized CXCR4 reportedly localizes
to recycling endosomes in T-cells (Zhang et al., 2004). We
do not see colocalization of internalized gp120 with endo-
somal markers, raising the possibility that sensory neu-
rons and hematopoetic cells utilize different pathways to
internalize CXCR4.
The bulk of gp120 was internalized through lipid
rafts in neurons and neuron-like cells, but a small frac-
tion was internalized through fluid phase pinocytosis.
One possibility is that the fraction of gp120 taken up
by fluid phase pinocytosis was due to the nonselectivity
of the process (Lim and Gleeson, 2011); in fact, fluid
phase pinocytosis is increased if the concentration of a
fluorescent ligand is high enough to saturate a receptor-
mediated process (Swanson, 1989). However, these two
mechanisms have been found concurrently in the intern-
alization of HIV in brain microvascular endothelial cells
(Liu et al., 2002), demonstrating that both lipid raft
internalization and fluid phase pinocytosis might
mediate soluble (shed) gp120 or HIV virion internaliza-
tion in multiple cell types. Additional experiments are
needed to understand whether one or both routes of
gp120 internalization contribute to pathogenesis.
However, our data suggest that inhibition of lipid raft
internalization (through cholesterol-lowering drugs such
as statins) or fluid phase pinocytosis (through sodium
proton exchange inhibitors like dimethyl amiloride)
might have beneficial effects to halt or prevent DSP
progression.
What is the fate of internalized gp120 in DRG neu-
rons? If internalization occurs within axons, then gp120
would not be immediately degraded, as degradation of
endocytosed protein by lysosomes occurs in the perinuc-
lear region of the neuron (Parton et al., 1992; Tai and
Schuman, 2008). Significantly, gp120 was transported in
the retrograde direction from isolated DRG axons to
their fluidically isolated cell bodies. Retrograde axonal
transport of gp120 is consistent with time course studies
in F11 cells, as gp120-derived fluorescence first appeared
Figure 9. Internalized gp120 undergoes retrograde but not anterograde transport along DRG axons. Primary DRG neurons were grown
in compartmentalized microfluidic devices. To examine retrograde transport of gp120, DRG neurons were seeded in the larger com-
partment to isolate cell bodies fluidically (schematic on a). The ATC was treated with 70 nM gp120 for 4 hr, and then the cells were fixed
and stained with an anti-tubulin antibody (in red). Scale bar: 15 mm. Representative images of DRG neurons show that, after 4 hr of
treatment, gp120 is present within axons in the microfluidic channels and in cell bodies within the SDC, demonstrating that gp120 has been
transported from the ATC to the SDC. Conversely, DRG neurons were seeded in the smaller compartment to isolate their axons
fluidically (schematic on b). The SDC was treated with 70 nM gp120 for 4 hr, and then the cells were fixed and stained as in (a).
Representative images of DRG neurons show that fluorescein-gp120 was not detected in the microfluidic channels or in the ATC,
indicating that gp120 is not transported in the anterograde direction from the SDC to the ATC.

within neurites, gradually accumulating at the perinuclear
region at later time points. Although prelysosomal endo-
somes are among the organelles moving with retrograde
axonal transport, colocalization studies with the lyso-
somal marker LAMP2 rule out a lysosomal destination
for gp120, suggesting a different organelle such as a sig-
naling endosome (Howe and Mobley, 2004) or another
less well-characterized membrane-bounded organelle.
Experiments with microfluidic devices indicated that
gp120 was not transported in the anterograde direction
from the cell body to axons, consistent with prior work
which reported that selective retrograde transport of
viruses and viral proteins (Leopold and Pfister, 2006;
Berth et al., 2009). Identification of functional roles for
the gp120 target organelle is critical.
The present work establishes internalization of gp120
by sensory neurons and characterizes candidate path-
ways for internalization and intracellular location of
gp120. To date, the majority of research examining
direct gp120 neurotoxicity in DSP has focused on its
binding to CXCR4 and subsequent activation of signal-
ing cascades (Kamerman et al., 2012). Significantly,
gp120 follows a pathway by which HIV can enter
cells and escape into the cytoplasm to infect cells. As
a result, intracellular actions of gp120 that might
underlie the toxic effect of gp120 on DRG neurons
remain to be characterized. Intracellular actions of
gp120 may play a role in the development of dying
back neurodegeneration. For example, intracellular
gp120 may affect signaling pathways involved in fast
axonal transport regulation, which are critical for main-
tenance of axonal connectivity and neuronal survival
(Berth et al., 2009; Morfini et al., 2009). Identifying
intracellular effects of this protein within axons may
provide important information on the molecular basis
for DSP in long-term HIV patients and could lead to
the development of novel therapeutic treatments for
HIV-related DSP.
Summary
The neurotoxic HIV glycoprotein gp120 was found to be
internalized through lipid rafts and fluid phase pinocyt-
osis and retrogradely transported along axons, providing
evidence for intracellular interactions by gp120 in the
peripheral nervous system.
