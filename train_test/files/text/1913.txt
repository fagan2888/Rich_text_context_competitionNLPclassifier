Religious Participation and Mortality Risk
Among the Oldest Old in China

Objectives. Rapid population aging in China calls for more research into social factors responsible for health and well-
being among older adults. This article adds to this line of inquiry by examining the relationship between religious
participation and mortality, as well as the potential pathways linking these factors and subgroup variations among oldest
old Chinese.
Methods. Using two waves (1998 and 2000) of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, I estimated Cox
proportional hazards models for a nationwide sample of Chinese aged 80 to 105.
Results. Controlling for a wide range of covariates, I found religious participation to be significantly associated with
lower risk of mortality for oldest old women and for individuals in poor health. Engaging in leisure activities and exercises
partially accounted for this association.
Discussion. Findings suggest that (a) religious participation, associated with other socially integrated and cognitively
stimulating activities, predicts mortality risk among oldest old Chinese; and (b) religious participation offers psychosocial
resources that are likely to compensate for the increased mortality risk associated with disadvantaged socioeconomic
conditions of certain vulnerable groups such as women and individuals in poor health.
Key Words: Religious participation--Mortality--Oldest old--China.
CHINA, the most populous country in the world, is now
aging at a rapid speed. The number of the oldest old
population aged 80 and older, currently the largest of any
nation in the world, may increase by more than 100 million by
2050 (Zeng, Liu, & George, 2003). China's population control
program, the ``one-child policy'' introduced in 1980, worsened
the situation by reducing the size of the younger population.
This imbalance makes the care of older persons at both society
and family levels increasingly difficult and calls for the
recognition of social factors responsible for the well-being of
older Chinese.
Religious participation stands out as one of the important
health-promoting social factors worthy of exploration. Despite
the recent decades of government constraint, China has
historically been a country of multiple religious traditions, all
of which have characteristics that are particularly relevant to
health (e.g., Ai, 2000, 2006). A recent survey on religious
beliefs in China (Wu, 2007) disclosed that approximately one
fourth of the Chinese population, or more than 300 million
Chinese, is involved in religious activities of one form or
another. This makes it feasible to explore the religion­health
association, a long neglected topic, in contemporary China. Spe-
cifically, this article examines the religion­mortality associa-
tion, as well as the potential mechanisms linking these factors
and the subgroup variations.
THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL BACKGROUND
Previous Research on Religion and Mortality in the
United States
The past three decades have witnessed a growing body of
U.S. research examining relationships between individual
religious involvement and health (for reviews, see Ellison &
Levin, 1998; Koenig, McCullough, & Larson, 2001). In-
creasing evidence suggests that multiple features of religious-
ness have beneficial effects on a wide range of health outcomes
(Hummer, Ellison, Rogers, Moulton, & Romero, 2004; Koenig
et al., 2001). In particular, more frequent service attendance is
associated with a reduced risk of mortality (for reviews, see
Hummer et al., 2004; McCullough, Larson, Hoty, Koenig, &
Thoresen, 2000). Evidence comes from community-based epide-
miologic surveys (e.g., Koenig et al., 1999; Lutgendorf et al.,
2004; Oman & Reed, 1998; Strawbridge, Cohen, Shema, &
Kaplan, 1997), nationwide surveys (Hummer, Rogers, Nam, &
Ellison, 1999; Musick, House, & Williams, 2004), as well as
clinical samples (Oxman, Freeman, & Manheimer, 1995;
Pargament, Koenig, Tarakeshwar, & Hahn, 2001). Not
surprisingly, many of these studies have focused on older
adults (e.g., Helm, Hays, Flint, Koenig, & Blazer, 2000; Hill,
Angel, Ellison, & Angel, 2005; Krause, 1998; Lutgendorf et al.,
2004), among whom levels of religiousness tend to be high and
for whom religion is an arguably important social resource.
Despite these recent advances in research on religion and
mortality, investigators have only begun to examine this
association among racial and ethnic minorities (Ellison,
Hummer, Cormier, & Rogers, 2000; Hill et al., 2005). There
is evidence indicating that religious involvement is associated
with a reduction in the risk of mortality among African
American adults (Ellison et al., 2000) and older Hispanics (Hill
et al., 2005). However, little research has been done on the
religion­mortality association in a non-Western setting. In
this study, I hypothesized that participating in Eastern re-
ligions would also reduce the odds of death. This is the first
hypothesis.

Religious Participation and Mortality in China
Most people in China practice a combination of folk religion,
Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. Different from Western
congregational religions, Chinese religious traditions have long-
standing and distinct psychosocial and behavioral functions on
health and well-being. For instance, followers of Confucian
teachings believe that virtues such as self-cultivation, chung
(loyalty), shu (empathy), and jen (humaneness) are imperative to
developing and maintaining deep and profound relationships
with self, family, community, and state (Taylor, 1998). This
greatly facilitates the formation of secular social ties, on the basis
of which coreligionists are likely to engage in various leisure
activities that are socially integrated or cognitively stimulating,
such as collective exercises, playing cards, chase, or Mah-jongg
(Ross & Zhang, 2008). Buddhism is more similar to Western
religion with respect to spiritual and ritual practices that are
likely to offer means to spiritual well-being, such as tolerance,
self-control, harmony, inner peace, and wisdom (Ai, 2000).
These faith-based attitudes, along with rituals such as prayer,
may lead to positive expectations such as hope and optimism
(Ai, Peterson, Tice, Bolling, & Koenig, 2004) that are likely to
help vulnerable older Chinese such as women and individuals
in bad health to cope effectively with traumatic life events. The
spirit of Taoism underlines the mind­body connection and
promotes holistic well-being through energy-based health
practices and healing processes such as tai chi or qigong, which
involve deep breath and meditation with movement (Ai, 2006).
In sum, Chinese religions have a potential impact on the
health and well-being of older adults. They integrate essences
from different religious traditions, build social as well as
spiritual relationships, encourage an active lifestyle among
participants, and create positive expectations. In this sense,
China is a nation of religion, not by a Western definition, but in
its own way. Many aspects of Chinese religions are likely to be
associated with a reduction in the risk of mortality. This study
hypothesized two sets of potential mediators linking Chinese
religions and mortality: psychological resources indicated by
optimism and autonomy, and health behaviors indicated by
engaging in collective exercises and other leisure activities.
This is the second hypothesis.
Religion and Mortality: Subgroup Variations
Findings on religion and mortality have become increasingly
robust, but studies have only begun to examine the contingent
effects of religious involvement on mortality, and the available
evidence is far from conclusive. Rogers, Hummer, and Nam
(2000) suggested a stronger religion­mortality association for
younger adults, Ellison and colleagues (2000) showed gender
differences in mechanisms underlying the religion­mortality
link, and Oman and Reed (1998) indicated that religious
attendance amplified the effects of social support on mortality.
Whereas some studies have shown stronger religion­mortality
links among women, and especially among older women
(Koenig et al., 1999; Strawbridge et al., 1997), studies of
general populations have not (Hummer et al., 1999; Musick
et al., 2004). Virtually no evidence suggests that the religion­
mortality association differs by health status.
To explain how the influence of religiosity on health and
well-being conditioned on demographic factors, Schieman,
Nguyen, and Elliot (2003) proposed two competing theories.
One is called resource amplification theory: Religion is more
valuable in the context of other resources such as education,
income, and social activities. The other is called resource
compensation theory: Religion is more important in the absence
of other types of advantage. Supporting the resource amplifi-
cation view, Schieman and colleagues suggested that the
negative association between religiosity and mastery was
stronger among those who were poorly educated. Their findings
on religion and mental health shed light on the religion­
mortality association. Alternatively, Ellison (1991) indirectly
suggested the resource compensation view: The ``existential
certainty'' was associated more positively with life satisfaction
among those who were less educated. Similarly, Ross and
Mirowsky (2006) disclosed the gender-conditioned association
between education and psychological well-being: Women
benefit more from education than men because resources
substitute for one another, and the presence of education makes
the absence of other resources less harmful.
Extending resource compensation or substitution theory into
the religion­mortality scenario, one can reasonably argue that
religiousness, and the resources derived from it, benefit lon-
gevity more for socioeconomically deprived groups such as
women and individuals in poor health. For instance, Chinese
women have historically lived in a patriarchal society where
they have structurally and systematically been denied education
and mentally stimulating occupations (National Research
Council, 2000; Zhang, 2006). As a result, they face more eco-
nomic dependency and are more socioeconomically disadvan-
taged. In this study, I examined how participating in religious
activities may compensate for or amplify the disadvantaged
socioeconomic positions for women and for individuals in poor
health. This is the third hypothesis of this article.
METHODS
Data
Data to test these ideas came from the 1998 and 2000
Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS).
CLHLS was conducted by randomly selecting one half of the
cities and counties of China's 22 provinces where Han Chinese
are the ethnic majority. The survey area covered more than 85%
of the Chinese population. The baseline sample included 9,093
respondents aged 77 to 122 and had a response rate of 88%. In
2000, 4,831 respondents remained and were reinterviewed,
whereas 3,368 respondents had died and 894 were unavailable
for follow-up. This data set was ideal for testing the three pro-
posed hypotheses because of its richness in variables tapping
characteristics of religious participation, psychosocial resour-
ces, and a wide range of health behaviors. This study focused
on 8,805 respondents aged 80 to 105 years old at baseline.
I excluded those aged 106 and older due to insufficient infor-
mation to validate their old age (Zeng & Vaupel, 2002). After
listwise deletion of missing values, the analytic sample was
reduced to 6,747.
Measurement
Mortality. --Based on informant report, I recorded mortality
from 1998 to 2000, yielding a roughly 2-year follow-up period.
ZHANG
S294
I created a binary variable to distinguish the oldest old who had
died (sometime between 1998 and 2000) from those who were
still alive at the 2000 interview. I defined survival time as the
number of days between the baseline interview and the date of
death or final interview, at which point surviving participants
represented censored observations. Roughly 37% of the
participants died over the 2-year study period.
Religious participation. --Respondents were asked how
often they participated in religious activities (1 ¼ every day,
3 ¼ never). I grouped participants indicating every day and
sometimes were grouped into one category (1) and participants
indicating never into another (0). More than 17% of the sample
reported participating in religious activities at least sometimes.
Demographics. --Demographic measures included age (in
years), ethnicity (Han: 0¼minority, 1¼Han), gender (female: 0¼
male, 1 ¼ female), marital status (married: 0 ¼ not married, 1 ¼
married), education (literate: 0 ¼ illiterate, 1 ¼ literate), urban/
rural residence (urban: 0¼rural residence, 1¼urban residence),
and east/west residence (east: 0 ¼ west residence, 1 ¼ east
residence). A majority of the sample was Han (93%), female
(57%), rural (63%), illiterate (66%), and unmarried (82%).
Baseline health status. --Respondents were asked to evaluate
their overall health status (1 ¼ very bad, 5 ¼ very good). The
mean level of self-reported health was 3.64, roughly approach-
ing the ``good'' category.
Psychological resources. --I used optimism and autonomy
as the indicators of psychological resources. Respondents were
asked the following: ``How often do you look on the bright side
of things?'' and ``How often do you make your own
decisions?'' Responses to these two questions were coded in
an increasing (1­5) manner such that higher scores reflected
more optimism and autonomy. A majority of the sample
reported above average levels of optimism (M ¼ 3.9) and of
making their own decisions (M ¼ 3.51).
Health behaviors. --I incorporated three health risk factors,
some of which have been used in previous studies (Hill,
Ellison, Burdette, & Musick, 2007; Musick et al., 2004;
Strawbridge, Shema, Cohen, & Kaplan, 2001), and some of
which were highly relevant in the Chinese cultural setting
(Ross & Zhang, 2008). A four-item index on engagement in
leisure activities gauged how often (1 ¼ never, 3 ¼ every day)
respondents (a) did gardening, (b) read newspapers or
magazines, (c) watched television or listened to the radio, and
(d) played cards or Mah-jongg. I measured exercise in response
to the question ``Do you exercise at present?'' I measured
smoking in response to the question ``Do you smoke at
present?'' The answers were coded into yes¼1 and no¼0. The
mean level of leisure activity engagement was around 1.34.
Approximately 30% of the sample reported that they exercised,
and 19% of the respondents smoked.
RESULTS
I first examined the sample attrition pattern. A binary
variable marked those lost to the second interview and those
who either were available for the second interview or had died.
I then applied logistic regression to regress this binary outcome
on the Wave 1 measures. Findings revealed that the sample
attrition did not occur in a random manner: Participants who
were lost between 1998 and 2000 were more likely to be Han,
urban residents, and highly educated. However, religious
participation and the proposed mediators did not predict the
loss of sample. This kept enough variability in religious
participation in the remaining sample and facilitated the follow-
up analyses on the effects of religious participation on
mortality.
I then applied Cox proportional hazards models to estimate
mortality risk depending on religious participation and control,
mediating, and moderating factors. Model 1 tested the religion­
mortality association, adjusting for demographics and health
status when appropriate. In Models 2 through 4, I added
psychosocial mediators to see how much they could account for
the religion­mortality association. I examined moderating
effects by creating cross-product terms between religion and
gender, and health status, with each cross-product term entering
the main effects model separately.
Upon examination of the whole sample (N ¼ 6,747; data not
shown), the hazard ratio (HR) in the first model suggested that
religious participation was significantly related to a lower risk
of mortality (HR ¼ 0.87, p ¼ .002) over and above controls.
Exercise and engagement were significant mediators, sub-
stantially reducing the significance level of religion (HR¼0.92,
p ¼ .16). Adding the cross-product terms into the final model
(Model 4) suggested that the interaction effects for gender
(HR ¼ 0.81, p ¼ .085) and health status (HR ¼ 1.35, p ¼ .009)
were moderately to strongly significant.
To provide more insight into the moderating effects,
I divided the sample into four subgroups: women, men,
individuals in poor health, and individuals in good health. For
each subgroup, I applied the same modeling strategies. Table 1
presents the hazard rate ratios from the Cox proportional
hazards models for women and for individuals in poor health.
For women, participating in religious activities significantly
reduced the mortality risk over and above controls for
demographics and health status (HR ¼ 0.82, p ¼ .006). Tests
of mediating effects suggested that respondents who engaged
little in exercise or other leisure activities were at an increased
risk for mortality. By adding these mediators into Models 3 and
4, I found that the effects of religion diminished somewhat
(HR¼0.87, p¼.054). I found similar patterns for individuals in
poor health (see the right-hand side of Table 1): Religious
participation significantly reduced their mortality risk over and
above controls and mediators (HR ¼ 0.79, p ¼ .009). By
contrast, religious participation had no significant effects for
men or for individuals in good health (data not shown). These
results suggest that religious participation in China has
significant and sizeable direct and indirect effects on mortality
for women and for individuals in poor health.
DISCUSSION
Focusing on oldest old people in China, this study advances
prior research by specifically examining the contingent effects
of religion on mortality. I found that the impact of religious
participation on the reduction of mortality was more salient for
RELIGIOSITY AND MORTALITY IN CHINA S295
socioeconomically disadvantaged groups such as women and
individuals in poor health who have fewer alternative resources.
This implies resource compensation rather than amplification:
Resources can substitute for one another to decrease the risk of
mortality. The effect of having a specific resource is greater for
those who have fewer alternatives. Religion not only helps
people who are healthy to avoid illness but favorably alters the
course of illness among those who are already ill.
In addition, the religion­mortality mediators exhibited
unique features in China: A substantial portion of religious
effect on mortality was mediated by health behaviors rather than
by psychological resources such as optimism and autonomy.
This indicates the dialectic nature of Eastern religions, which
do not necessarily lead to positive psychological status as do
Western religions. These findings suggest that religious partic-
ipation in China might help older Chinese develop healthy
lifestyles, stimulate social engagement, and thus reduce mortality
risk. Not only do individuals participate in religious activities,
they also help to produce them; by doing so, they greatly enhance
their health and well-being (Musick et al., 2004).
The results of this investigation are intriguing; however,
much remains to be explored. The first priority is measurement
improvement. Future research should examine the content of
religion and spirituality practice or beliefs rather than treat them
as social or demographic components such as simple measures
of education or income. For example, the measure of religious
participation needs to be further decomposed to identify the
precise facet of religion that is responsible for the health-
protective effects. Does it reflect public attendance (similar to
organizational participation in the United States) or private
religious practice (such as praying at home)? Although my
follow-up in-depth interviews in China suggested both, more
well-developed survey questions gauging multiple features
of religiousness are greatly needed. In addition, more waves
of data covering a longer period of time, as well as more com-
prehensive samples covering younger generations, are likewise
imperative. In this study, approximately 23% of the sample was
lost due to item nonresponse. This high rate indicates the
general low levels of education among oldest old Chinese. By
sampling younger generations with more years of schooling,
future researchers will likely overcome this problem.
