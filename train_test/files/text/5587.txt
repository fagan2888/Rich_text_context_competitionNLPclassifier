Introduction
Marijuana is the world's most commonly used illicit sub-
stance and estimates suggest there are between 119 and 224
million marijuana users worldwide (UN Office on Drugs and
Crime, 2012). Estimates from the National Survey on Drug
Use and Health suggest that there are 18.1 million current
(past month) marijuana users in the United States (Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
[SAMHSA], 2012). Among American illicit drug users,
roughly two thirds (64.3%) report the use of only marijuana
(SAMHSA, 2012). Marijuana use often begins during adoles-
cence1 and by 12th grade, 36% of young people in the United
States report past-year marijuana use (Johnston, O'Malley,
Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2012). Rates of recent (past
30 day) marijuana use among adolescents now exceed rates
of cigarette use among that age group (15.2% and 11.7%,
respectively; Johnston et al., 2012). Annual prevalence data
have also documented increases in the rates of marijuana use
among American adolescents between 2008 and 2011
(Johnston et al., 2012). Among adolescents and young adults
who use marijuana, approximately 26% meet Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.;
DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) crite-
ria for marijuana abuse or dependence (Wu, Woody, Yang,
Pan, & Blazer, 2011). Approximately half of the individuals
who enter treatment for marijuana use are below the age of 25
(Budney, Roffman, Stephens, & Walker, 2007).
While marijuana use is relatively common, it has been
connected to several adverse outcomes, particularly among
adolescents. Adolescent marijuana use has been associated
with an increased risk of a range of negative health outcomes,
including future depression and anxiety disorders (Rey,
Martin, & Krabman, 2004), fatal automobile crashes
(Asbridge, Hayden, & Cartwright, 2012), accidental injuries,
chronic bronchitis, and respiratory infections (Hall &
Degenhardt, 2009). As adolescent brains are still developing,
the results of frequent marijuana use are a particular concern
among this age group. Frequent marijuana use among ado-
lescents can have a detrimental impact on cognitive func-
tioning and may affect functional and structural development
in areas of the brain involved in higher intellectual capabili-
ties (Lisdahl, Nagel, & Tapert, 2010; Schweinsburg, Brown,
& Tapert, 2008). A recent prospective study of more than

Public Perceptions and Attitudes Toward
Adolescent Marijuana Use: Results of a
Statewide Survey
Stella M. Resko1
Abstract
The purpose of the current study is to examine patterns in public perceptions and attitudes toward marijuana use among
adolescents. Computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) was used to collect data from a statewide sample of adults in
Michigan identified through random-digit dialing (n = 560). CATI interviews were supplemented with web- and paper-based
surveys for nonrespondents. We used latent class analysis to characterize patterns in public perception, using a vignette
technique that assessed (a) whether adults recognize adolescent marijuana use as a problem, (b) how they view the efficacy
of treatment, (c) how they view help-seeking with mental health professionals, and (d) whether they support prevention
services for adolescents. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between class membership
and demographics, substance use, and methodological factors. Three latent classes were identified: (a) a discriminating group,
(b) a low-concern group, and (c) a high-concern group. Age and substance use were among the strongest determinants for
membership in the discriminating group. Results provide insight into how the general public perceives marijuana use and
marijuana-related problems among adolescents.

1,000 people, for example, found individuals who used mari-
juana heavily in adolescence and continued through adult-
hood showed a significant drop in IQ between the ages of 13
and 38 (Meier et al., 2012). Under the influence of marijuana,
adolescents also may display impaired judgment, contribut-
ing to risky behaviors such as unprotected sex, driving under
the influence, or riding with an intoxicated driver (Gruber &
Pope, 2002). Earlier age of onset for marijuana use is associ-
ated with increased risk of developing substance-use prob-
lems (Brook, Brook, Zhang, Cohen, & Whiteman, 2002;
Lynskey et al., 2003).
Despite these potential consequences, the levels of per-
ceived risk and disapproval of marijuana among adults and
adolescents are low and steadily declining (Gallup, 2011;
Johnston et al., 2012). When Gallup, for example, first sur-
veyed adults in the United States regarding marijuana legal-
ization in 1969, only 12% favored it. Results of a more recent
survey indicate that 50% of Americans now support mari-
juana legalization (Gallup, 2011). Among adolescents, the
perceived risk associated with marijuana use has been declin-
ing during the late 1990s and 2000s. Survey results from
2011 indicate that most adolescents (57% of 8th graders,
70% of 10th graders, and 60% of 12th graders) do not view
occasional marijuana use as a great risk (Johnston et al.,
2012). Studies suggest that adolescents who believe a par-
ticular substance involves low levels of risk of harm and/or
who approve of its use are more likely to use that substance
(Cleveland, Feinberg, Bontempo, & Greenberg, 2008). The
recent declines in perceived risk are indicative of recent
shifts in American community norms that are more tolerant
of marijuana use (Freise & Grube, 2013). Between 1996 and
September 2013, twenty U.S. states and the District of
Columbia have enacted laws making medical marijuana
legal for adults.2 Approximately 70% of adults in the United
States favor laws making it legal for doctors to prescribe
marijuana to reduce pain and suffering (Gallup, 2011). Voters
have also recently approved ballot measures to legalize rec-
reational marijuana use among adults in Colorado and
Washington State. Although these policies have received
broad public support, there is some concern that these
changes could lead to increases in access to marijuana and
increases in the likelihood and frequency of marijuana use
among children and adolescents (Freise & Grube, 2013).
Few studies have examined the public's perceptions of,
and response to, marijuana use in adolescents. Previous
research on the attitudes toward adolescent marijuana use
has focused on the views of adolescents (e.g., Cleveland
et al., 2008; Johnston et al., 2012) and parents/care givers
(e.g., Fisher et al., 2006; Winters, Anderson, Bengston,
Stinchfield, & Latimer, 2000). Little is known about the gen-
eral public's knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward adoles-
cent marijuana use and related problems. While the recent
opinion polls (e.g., Gallup, 2011) and referenda indicate some
leniency toward marijuana (Freise & Grube, 2013), there are
at this time few accompanying indicators of a strong commit-
ment to prevention of use among the adolescent population.
Adolescents rarely enter into substance-abuse treatment
independently (Godley & White, 2005). Consequently, their
substance-abuse prevention and treatment needs must be
understood in the context of familial, social, and cultural
expectations. Until service providers understand the public's
ideas and expectations, they cannot adequately anticipate
barriers to treatment that need to be surmounted before ado-
lescents can benefit. Furthermore, even when adolescents do
enter into treatment, treatment goals will likely be derailed if
parental and community beliefs counter treatment recom-
mendations (Taylor, 2010).
The purpose of the current study is to use a person-cen-
tered approach to examine patterns in the public perception
and attitude toward marijuana use among adolescents.
Person centered-models (e.g., latent class analysis [LCA],
mixture modeling, growth mixture models, cluster analysis)
highlight the heterogeneity within data and can help to iden-
tify groups of individuals who share similar attributes or
relationships among attributes (Laursen & Hoff, 2006). This
approach contrasts the more dominant variable-centered
research paradigm which describes associations between
variables rather than individuals.3 LCA is a form of person-
centered analysis that has been widely used in the substance-
use field (e.g., B. O. Muthén & Muthén, 2000; O'Connor &
Colder, 2005). Classes of distinct subgroups are identified
based on similar response patterns for a set of indicator vari-
ables (McCutcheon, 1987). For the present study, we use
LCA to characterize patterns based on whether adults in
Michigan (a) recognize adolescent marijuana use as a prob-
lem, (b) view treatment to be effective for adolescent mari-
juana use, (c) view help-seeking with mental health
professionals to be an appropriate strategy for addressing
adolescent marijuana use, and (d) whether they support pre-
vention services for adolescents. After identifying these
classes that share similar configurations of their public per-
ception of adolescent marijuana use, we explore whether
demographic characteristics (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, being
a parent), personal experiences with alcohol and drugs, and
methodological factors (e.g., type of survey) are associated
with different class memberships. Based on previous studies
that found an individual's own use of substances contributes
to their broader opinions of substance use (Hilton &
Kaskutas, 1991; Latimer, Harwood, Newcomb, & Wagenaar,
2001; Wagenaar, Harwood, Toomey, Denl, & Zander, 2000),
we hypothesize that each participant's personal experience
with alcohol and other substances will influence his or her
opinions on adolescent marijuana use. Building on earlier
substance-use studies (e.g., Pukstas, 2006), we also antici-
pate that parental status and other demographic variables
(e.g., age, race/ethnicity, and gender) would influence par-
ticipants' attitudes and beliefs related to adolescent mari-
juana use.

Method
Survey Sample and Procedures
We used computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI)
to collect data from a statewide sample of adults in Michigan.
Michigan provides a useful context for this particular study,
given that its voters approved the use of medical marijuana
for adults in a 2008 statewide ballot measure by a substantial
margin. Random-digit dialing was used to identify a sample
of 4,445 active telephone numbers. Surveys were conducted
with households where a person 18 or above agreed to par-
ticipate. To ensure an adequate sample size and inclusion of
individuals with only wireless telephone service or with no
phone service at all (Galesic, Tourangeau, & Couper, 2006),
the telephone survey was supplemented with paper- and
web-based surveys for nonrespondents. With the assistance
of a directory information service provider, we were able to
append addresses to about half of the active telephone num-
bers (2,198 out of 4,445). After 1 month of telephone
attempts, paper copies of the surveys were sent to all nonre-
spondents for which we had a mailing address (n = 1,720).
The mailed packet also included information on how to
access the survey online, including the web address and a
log-in ID and password. Individuals who indicated they did
not have time to complete the survey over the telephone were
also provided with the web address to complete the survey
online or were offered the survey by mail. Participants were
offered a US$5 gift card for their participation.
After 2 months of telephone interviewing and the mailing
to survey nonrespondents, data collection ceased. The total
number of unduplicated completed surveys was 624. During
the calling process, 1,164 of the 4,445 telephone numbers
were removed from the survey sample due to known ineligi-
bility (having dispositions such as disconnected number,
business number, fax/modem, unqualified resident). Using
guidelines from theAmericanAssociation for Public Opinion
Research (AAPOR, 2011), we calculated the response rate,
margin of error and response rate.4 A response rate of 25.8%
was obtained for the statewide survey and the margin of error
was ±3.8 percentage points. The cooperation rate was 58.3%.
For the current study, 64 participants were excluded from
analyses due to nonresponse on all of the vignette questions.
This results in an analytic sample size of n = 560.
Measures
For the current study, we adapted a vignette technique that
has been used in public opinion research on mental illness
(Pescosolido et al., 2008). Two vignettes describing mari-
juana use among 16-year-old adolescents were developed.
By focusing on this age, we were able to ensure participants
would be older than the adolescents described in the
vignettes. We also felt there may be greater variability in the
attitudes toward marijuana use among 16-year-olds com-
pared with younger adolescents (e.g., 13-year-olds). These
vignettes featured varying contexts, levels of marijuana use,
and problems associated with use.
After each of the vignettes, participants were asked as
series of questions in response to the situation that was
described (see the appendix for the vignettes and additional
survey items). These questions addressed perception of prob-
lem severity, belief in treatment efficacy, and attitude toward
help-seeking with a professional. The first question mea-
sured the perception of problem severity by asking: "How
serious would you consider this teen's problem, if any, to
be?" (very serious, somewhat serious, not very serious, or
not at all serious). The next question addressed the belief in
treatment efficacy and asked, "How likely do you think it is
that would this situation improve with treatment?" (very
likely, somewhat likely, somewhat unlikely, very unlikely).
The third question addressed help-seeking behaviors: "If this
child were your own, how likely is it that you would seek
help from a doctor, nurse, counselor, psychologist, social
worker, or other mental health professional?" (very likely,
somewhat likely, somewhat unlikely, or very unlikely).
Responses on these three questions were dichotomized to
create indicator variables for the LCA. Responses for the
problem severity question were coded as 1 for serious (com-
bining very serious and somewhat serious) and 0 for not seri-
ous (combining not very serious and not at all serious). The
other items were coded 1 for likely (combining very likely
and somewhat likely) and 0 for unlikely (combining some-
what unlikely and very unlikely). One additional question
from previous public opinion research (Pukstas, 2006) asked
participants about their general support for marijuana pre-
vention efforts. This item evaluated the level of agreement
with the statement, "It is possible to reduce marijuana prob-
lems through prevention" (strongly agree, somewhat agree,
or somewhat disagree or strongly disagree). Responses for
this question were also coded as 1 for likely (combining very
likely and somewhat likely) and 0 for unlikely (combining
somewhat unlikely and very unlikely). These seven items (six
questions based on the vignettes and the one question
addressing marijuana prevention more generally) were com-
bined and used as the indicator variables for the LCA.
Additional survey items were included as independent
and control variables. These included the participant's demo-
graphic/background characteristics, substance use, and the
data collection strategy (see the appendix for specific survey
items). Demographic measures included age (in years), gen-
der (male or female), and marital status (coded as married
and cohabitating vs. not married). Highest level of educa-
tional attainment was measured and responses were coded
into two groups (1 for those with bachelor's degree or higher
and 0 for those with less than a bachelor's degree). Parental
status was measured with two items assessing whether par-
ticipants have children (including adult children) and whether
they have children are below age 18 in their household. Two
questions from the Addiction Severity Index (McLellan
et al., 2002) were included to ask about recent experiences
4 SAGE Open
with alcohol or marijuana. These items asked "How many
days in the past month have you used alcohol?" and "How
many days in the past month have you used marijuana?" An
additional item from the National Survey on Drug Use and
Health (SAMHSA, 2012) was adapted to measure lifetime
experiences with drugs other than marijuana. This question
asked: In your lifetime, have you ever tried other illicit drugs
(other than marijuana), like cocaine or crack or heroin, or
any other substance not prescribed by a doctor, to get high or
to achieve an altered state? Two final items were used to
assess the impact of the recruitment strategy. These items
examined the extent of landline telephone usage (less than
1/3 of telephone calls on a landline coded as 1 and 1/3 or
greater coded as 0) and survey mode (CATI, web, or paper).
Analytic Strategy
LCA is a form of person-centered analysis and is used to
identify different and distinct patterns within the broader
population, based on the similarity of responses to the ado-
lescent marijuana use variables (e.g., problem recognition,
and treatment efficacy). This approach may facilitate the
identification of particular subgroups within the population
that vary in the extent to which they view adolescent sub-
stance abuse as a problem and the extent to which they sup-
port substance-abuse treatment for problems related to
adolescent marijuana use. We compared a series of latent
class models to determine the optimal model in terms of bal-
ancing model fit and parsimony. Multiple indicators were
examined to assess model fit, including the Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC; Schwarz, 1978), entropy and
average latent class posterior probabilities, the number and
percentage of participants in the smallest class, and interpret-
ability of results.
The BIC (Sclove, 1987) is considered to be one of the
more reliable indicators of model fit in LCA (Nylund,
Asparouhov, & Muthén, 2007; Tofighi & Enders, 2007).
Lower BIC values indicate better model fit. BIC can be used
to assess relative fit when comparing models with various
numbers of classes (e.g., two classes vs. three classes).
Posterior probabilities provide another criterion to assess
model fit in LCA. Rather than assigning each individual par-
ticipant to a specific class (as is done in cluster analysis), in
LCA each participant is assigned a probability value for
membership in each class. These probabilities are a function
of each individual's response patterns, the number of latent
classes, and the proportion of individuals estimated to be in
each class (Roesch, Villodas, & Villodas, 2010). In a well-
fitting model, each participant will have a high probability of
membership in one class and low probability of membership
in all other classes. Entropy provides an aggregate measure
of the posterior probabilities and is an indicator of how well
classes can be distinguished. Entropy values above 0.8 are
considered acceptable (Ramaswamy, DeSarbo, Reibstein, &
Robinson, 1993; Weden & Zabin, 2005). Class size should
also be taken into consideration when comparing latent class
models. Classes with less than 5% of the sample in the small-
est group are generally discouraged unless smaller groups
are expected, based on theory or epidemiology (Weller,
Bowen, & Bowen, 2013).The final and perhaps most impor-
tant model selection criteria are substantive meaning and
interpretability (B. O. Muthén & Muthén, 2000; O'Connor &
Colder, 2005). According to numerous LCA experts, sub-
stantive meaning and interpretability are critical consider-
ations that can sometimes supersede statistical criteria for
selection of the final latent class model (B. O. Muthén &
Muthén, 2000; O'Connor & Colder, 2005; Weller et al.,
2013).
Once the final latent class model was identified, we con-
ducted multinomial logistic regression to investigate the
relationship between class membership and demographic
characteristics, substance use, and the data collection strat-
egy. Race/ethnicity, initially classified into five categories in
descriptive analysis (i.e., non-Hispanic White, African
American, Hispanic, Asian American, and Other) was con-
verted into dichotomous variables (i.e., White and non-
White) for multinomial logistic regression because of small
sample sizes in several groups. Data were weighted using
sampling weights that adjust for oversampling based on age,
gender and race/ethnicity. Latent class models were con-
ducted in Mplus version 6.12 (L. K. Muthén & Muthén,
1998-2010) and the multinomial logistic regression was con-
ducted in Stat version 12 (StataCorp, 2011).
Results
Descriptive Statistics5
Survey participants (n = 560) ranged in age from 18 to 95,
with an average age of 49 years (SD = 16.3). Half of the par-
ticipants (49%) were female, and more than half (60%) were
married or cohabitating. Most of the participants (77%) self-
identified their primary racial or ethnic origin as white/
Caucasian, while a smaller proportion of participants identi-
fied themselves as Black/African American (13%), Latino/
Hispanic, American Indian, Asian/Pacific Islander, or Arab/
Middle Eastern (less than 3% for each of these groups). While
the majority of participants (79%) reported having children,
only 39% had children under the age of 18. Regarding educa-
tional level, 58% had earned a high school diploma/GED or
less, while 42% of participants had completed a college
degree (26% had completed a bachelor's degree and 16% had
completed a graduate or professional degree). More than half
the sample (54%) reported recent (past 30 day) alcohol use,
while only 6% reported recent (past 30 day) marijuana use.
Almost a quarter of participants in the sample (22%) reported
that they have used nonmedical prescription drugs or illicit
drugs other than marijuana in their lifetimes.
Most participants (74%) completed the survey through
the CATI, while smaller numbers completed the web (2%) or
Resko 5
paper (24%) surveys. Approximately a third of participants
(37%) reported that they receive few of their telephone calls
(one third or less) on a land-based telephone line; 18%
reported receiving between 1/3 and 2/3 of their calls on a
landline. Just under half of the sample (45%) reported receiv-
ing most of their phone calls (2/3 or more) on a land-based
telephone.
Fifty-four percent of participants considered the first sce-
nario to be a serious problem. For the second scenario, the
majority of participants (92%) identified the situation as a
serious problem. Approximately one third of participants
(32%) felt the situation in scenario one would improve with
treatment, while 83% felt the situation in scenario two would.
A large proportion of participants reported that they would
seek help from a health professional (e.g., doctor nurse,
counselor, psychologist, social worker) if the teens in the
scenarios were their own children (66% for scenario one and
83% for scenario two). Most participants (86%) agreed with
the statement that it is possible to reduce marijuana problems
through prevention.
LCA
We determined that the three class model provided a more
optimal solution, compared with one- two-, three-, four-class
models. The three class model exhibited the best empirical fit
(BIC = 4,219; entropy = 0.95, posterior probabilities  .95)
and had a clearly distinguishable set of classes that were con-
ceptually plausible. Figure 1 presents the adolescent mari-
juana use ratings for each class. The seven marijuana indicator
variables are along the x-axis and the probabilities of class
membership are plotted along the y-axis. The probability of
class membership represents the average probability that
members in a class reported high scores (indicator variable =
1) on each item. The distinguishing features of each class
were used in selecting names for each class. The first class
had moderate probabilities for problem recognition and help-
seeking for the first vignette (Class 1: "discriminating class"
26.7%). This class had higher probabilities of problem recog-
nition and help-seeking for the second vignette, which
involved more problems (e.g., problems at school, marijuana
possession arrest). The second class had low probabilities of
problem recognition and help-seeking behaviors for both
vignettes (Class 2: "low concern" 7.0%). The final and largest
class, had high probabilities of problem recognition and help-
seeking across the two scenarios (Class 3: "high concern"
66.4%).
Multinomial Logistic Regression
To learn more about patterns related to the public perceptions
of adolescent marijuana use, we looked at demographic char-
acteristics (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, being a parent), alcohol
and drug use, and methodological factors (e.g., type of sur-
vey) for each of the public perception latent classes, using
multinomial logistic regression analysis. The multinomial
logistic regression model was estimated by entering all vari-
ables simultaneously. Each latent class is compared with the
high-concern reference group (Class 3). Table 1 describes the
relationships between the public perception classes and the
study variables. When comparing the discriminating group
(Class 1) to the high-concern group (Class 3), there were sev-
eral notable differences. The discriminating group (Class 1)
was significantly younger than the high-concern group
(Class 3). Other demographic variables (i.e., gender, race,
education, marital status, and parental status) were not sig-
nificantly different between the discriminating and high-con-
cern public perception groups. The variables indicating
substance use of the respondent were among the strongest
determinants of group membership. Adults in the discrimi-
nating group (Class 1) were more likely than the high-con-
cern group (Class 3) to report alcohol or marijuana use in the
past 30 days (alcohol odds ratio [OR] = 1.72; confidence
interval [CI] = [1.03, 2.87]; marijuana OR = 3.82 CI = [1.24,
11.80]). Those participants in the discriminating group (Class 1)
were also more likely than the high-concern group to report
use of drugs other than marijuana (lifetime; OR = 2.24 CI =
[1.27, 3.95]). When comparing the low-concern group (Class
2) to the high-concern group (Class 3), there were no dis-
cernible differences.
Discussion
The health, psychosocial, and legal consequences associated
with marijuana use can be serious and the results of this
study suggest that most adults have concerns about mari-
juana use among adolescents. The largest group of partici-
pants (Class 3 "high-concern group" n = 476) recognized
both situations in the vignettes as potential problems. The
second largest group of adults (Class 1 "discriminating
group" n = 173) ascribed different levels of problem severity
to the hypothetical situations. These adults appeared to have
fewer concerns with marijuana use that occurred in a social

context and was not associated with other problems. Adults
in this discriminating class (Class 1) were more concerned
by the vignette that involved marijuana use in multiple con-
texts (e.g., social settings and alone) and several problems
related or potentially related to marijuana use (e.g., falling
grades, school suspension, and marijuana possession arrest).
This finding may reflect the attitude that experimentation
with marijuana during adolescence or young adulthood does
not necessarily indicate a very serious problem. For many
adolescents, marijuana use is developmentally limited and
does not lead to substance-use problems later in life
(Schulenberg et al., 2005). It also may reflect the popular
perception that marijuana is not considered an "addictive"
drug.
Participants in Classes 1 (discriminating group) and 3
(high-concern group) reported stronger beliefs in treatment
effectiveness, particularly in reacting to the second vignette.
These groups also showed higher levels of support for help-
seeking and indicated greater willingness to seek profes-
sional help if the adolescents described were their own
children. It is possible that this willingness may be over-
stated. Previous research using vignettes and hypothetical
situations (Hughes & Huby, 2004; Pescosolido et al., 2008)
has shown that willingness to seek help is likely to be lower
when faced with a similar situation in real life. Regardless,
these results provide insight into how the general public
assesses risk and views treatment for marijuana use among
adolescents.
Results indicate that individuals in the discriminating
group (Class 1) were significantly younger and reported
higher rates of current substance use, compared with the
high-concern group (Class 3). The finding that the discrimi-
nating group was significantly younger is consistent with
public opinion research that has demonstrated some differ-
ences in attitudes toward marijuana along age lines. Analysis
of the General Social Survey, for example, suggests that the
Silent Generation (those born between 1925 and 1945) is the
age cohort least likely to favor marijuana legalization in
the United States (Caulkins, Coulson, Farber, & Vesely,
2012). The findings of the current study suggest that one's
personal experiences with alcohol and drugs may also be
important factors in shaping individual dispositions to con-
sider a situation problematic and urge treatment. Sherman,
Nelson, and Steele (2000) suggested that individuals often
interpret situations involving health risks in such a way that
they can preserve a positive self-image. It is therefore not
surprising that many marijuana users do not see their use as
particularly risky or problematic (Kilmer, Hunt, Lee, &
Neighbors, 2007). The current study further suggests that
these types of assessments may also hold true when assess-
ing the risks for adolescent marijuana use.
Although most participants (93%) expressed some con-
cern related to the vignettes involving adolescent marijuana
use, a small group did not consider either of the situations in
the vignettes to be problematic or situations where they
would seek treatment if the teens were their own children
(Class 2; n = 52). In terms of their demographic background
and substance-use characteristics, the low-concern group
(Class 2) was fairly similar to the high-concern group (Class
3) that identified both vignettes as hypothesizing serious
problems. Although these groups are similar with regard to
recent alcohol and marijuana use, it is unclear whether these

groups also have similar previous experiences with alcohol,
marijuana and other drugs (e.g., past-year or lifetime). Other
studies have suggested that individual' past experiences
using marijuana are an important determinant in the per-
ceived risk associated with marijuana use (Kilmer et al.,
2007) and the attitude toward marijuana policies (Williams,
van Ours, & Grossman, 2011). In a sample of college stu-
dents, Kilmer and colleagues (2007) found that the perceived
risk associated with marijuana use was greater among nonus-
ers of marijuana than among those who did. Williams et al.
(2011) similarly found in the Australian Drug Strategy's
National Household Survey that both current marijuana use
and past use were significantly associated with supporting
marijuana legalization. Future research on public attitudes
toward adolescent marijuana use should explore whether
there are any differences in past substance use and substance-
use related consequences over the life span and if these fac-
tors are likely to impact group membership.
Limitations and Future Research
Results of this research should be viewed in the context of its
limitations. Due to the low response rate, generalizability
may be limited. The CATI helped us to achieve a relatively
high level of coverage of the state population and ensured
privacy and accuracy of reports of sensitive information
(Galesic et al., 2006). However, its use may have also
resulted in some bias. Sampling for this multimethod survey
was conducted using random-digit dialing and may under-
represent those individuals who do not have a telephone or
who only have mobile phones. Although 20.0% of our sam-
ple reported that they receive all of their phone calls on a
mobile telephone, this number is likely to be lower than the
rate of wireless-only households in Michigan. Estimates
from the National Health Interview Survey, for example,
suggest that, during the period which this study was con-
ducted, 29.2% of households in Michigan were wireless only
(Blumberg et al., 2011). Previous research on telephone sur-
veys has also indicated that demographic factors such as
income and employment are significantly related to partici-
pation (Johnson, Holbrook, Cho, & Bossarte, 2006). It is
possible that these factors are also related to variables in this
study. Finally, it is also worth noting that the assessments
were limited in scope and focused on just the two situations
described in the vignettes. Future studies would benefit from
using a broader range of situations that include more varied
levels of substance use, use of other substances and more
varied characteristics of the adolescents (e.g., gender, age,
race) as well as more detailed measures (e.g., lifetime sub-
stance-use experiences). The current study reflects only on
the public attitude toward 16-year-old adolescents and does
not reflect attitude toward older or younger adolescents.
Additional research on other ages and research using other
samples are also needed to establish stronger confidence in
the classes derived from the current data (Bauer, 2007;
Roesch et al., 2010). The current application of LCA is a
good first step toward this end.
Conclusion
The current study used a vignette technique to examine the
attitudes and beliefs held by the general public about adoles-
cent marijuana use. Marijuana has generally been perceived
as being associated with a lower level of risk, and both ado-
lescents and adults may be less likely to perceive a need to
treat adolescent marijuana problems. Understanding the pub-
lic's views is important as the number of state-level policies
providing adults access to marijuana for medical and recre-
ational purposes increases. Public opinion can help to shape
what individuals consider to be a problem and what advice is
given to adolescents and caregivers of adolescents facing
problems related to marijuana. The attitudes and beliefs of
the general public have been noticeably absent from the
research literature. The present study offers insight into how
the general public responds to marijuana use and related
problems among adolescents. This research represents only a
first step in understanding these cultural attitudes, and future
investigation is needed to examine other factors related to
adolescent marijuana use and treatment. A joint understand-
ing of the larger cultural context, coupled with a greater pub-
lic awareness of effective treatment opportunities may offer
a pathway to improved outcomes for adolescents.
