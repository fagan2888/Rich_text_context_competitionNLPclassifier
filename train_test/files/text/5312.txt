Effect of Copulins on Rating of Female
Attractiveness, Mate-Guarding, and
Self-Perceived Sexual Desirability
Megan N. Williams1,2 and Amy Jacobson1
Abstract
Olfaction and chemical signaling play an important role in the mating behaviors of many taxa, yet there is minimal empirical
research on human putative pheromones. A mixture of five volatile fatty acids secreted vaginally, identified and named ``copulins,''
significantly increase in concentration during the follicular phase and decrease in concentration during the luteal phase in nonpill
using women. Men exposed to copulins exhibit an increase in testosterone, are inhibited in discriminating the attractiveness of
women's faces, and behave less cooperatively. According to Anisogamy, Sexual Selection and Parental Investment Theory,
mammalian males, having low cost and high benefit from any copulatory interaction, may adaptively utilize any useful cues to
identifying ovulating females and adjust their behavior accordingly in order to maximize their potential reproductive success. In
the current study, we attempted a replication of Ju
¨tte and Grammer's finding indicating copulins inhibit the ability of men to
discriminate attractiveness of women's faces, and we examined the role of copulins in self-reported mate-guarding behaviors and
self-perceived sexual desirability. We utilized a randomized placebo-controlled design and as predicted, results indicated men
exposed to copulins were more likely to rate themselves as sexually desirable to women and, on average, the copulin group rated
women's faces as more attractive than controls. There were no significant findings with mate guarding.

Introduction
Females in many mammalian species undergo a period of time
referred to as estrus, when they are most likely to conceive and
are more receptive to copulation attempts by males (Miller,
Tybur, & Jordan, 2007). During estrus, several primate species
exhibit visual cues to their physiological status, like sexual
swelling (Grammer, Fink, & Neave, 2005). Humans do not
exhibit overt visual cues during ovulation. Thus, human ovula-
tion is often termed concealed, which may provide some
advantages to women, for example, increasing the appeal of
monogamous pair-bonding thereby increasing male parental
investment, increasing chances of successful cuckoldry, and
decreasing the risk of infanticide (Grammer et al., 2005;
Roberts et al., 2004).
Sexual Conflict and Parental Investment Theory explains
the diverging and often conflicting evolutionary interests of
males and females (Chapman, Arnqvist, Bangham, & Rowe,
2003). The disparity between male and female potentials for
lifetime reproductive success is reflected in the mating strata-
gems adopted by each sex (Trivers, 1972). Sperm are produced
throughout a lifetime, eggs, on the other hand, are finite. Eggs
are also the more energetically costly sex cell. Any copulation
event for a human female could result in 9 months of invest-
ment in a single offspring, thus females benefit from being
selective in their mate choice. Male investment, on the other
hand, can end with ejaculation. Males must compete for access
to the limiting resource, in this case females, which results in
some males monopolizing multiple females and other males

being left out the mating game entirely. Females have a low
risk of being left out the mating game, as mating with any
female is low cost and high benefit for a male. Because the
best interest of males and females are in conflict, with regard to
reproductive success, an evolutionary ``arms race'' manifested
as certain behavioral tendencies, such as mate guarding, and
physiological adaptations, like nonadvertised ovulation, may
be underway (Trivers, 1972).
Mate guarding and sexual jealousy occurs when a partner
perceives a threat to their mating relationship (Buss, 2002).
Buss (2002) described seven typical mate-guarding tactics:
vigilance, violence, concealment, monopolization of time, sex-
ual inducement, physical signs of possession, and possessive
ornamentation. Some examples of these tactics include obses-
sive calling and checking the whereabouts of one's partner,
dissuading a partner from attending a social gathering where
the opposite sex will be present, and even the custom of wed-
ding rings that signify the wearer is already in a committed
relationship.
Haselton and Gangestad (2006) showed that nonpill using
pair-bonded women self-reported more flirtatious behavior and
an increase in their partner's mate guarding around ovulation.
Near and during ovulation women are more likely to seek
extrapair copulations. Women may choose to engage in a
long-term relationship with men who are willing to invest their
time and resources in an offspring but seek ``sexy genes'' dur-
ing ovulation in an attempt to improve the overall genetic
quality of their offspring while also cuckolding parentally
investing men (Trivers, 1972). In self-report surveys, ovulating
women do show an increased preference for more attractive
men and an increased desirability for men besides their current
partner. This result is more extreme when the woman's primary
partner does not possess ``sexy traits'' (Haselton & Gilder-
sleeve, 2011). Gangestad, Garver-Apgar, Cousins, and Thron-
hill (2014) found that nonpill using women report greater
self-assertiveness and engage in more behaviors aimed at resist-
ing their partners mate guarding during their fertile phase. The
women's partners also self-reported more assertive behaviors
toward their partner, while she was at high conception risk.
Increased mate-guarding behavior during ovulation may be
related to something more than a response to changes in female
behavior (i.e., increased flirtation and desire for extrapair copu-
lation; Haselton & Gangestad, 2006). A large portion of
research on sexual behavior concerns visual cues and beha-
vioral signaling. Substantially less research has been devoted
to olfactory influences as humans have traditionally been clas-
sified as microsmatic (poor smellers; Carlson, 2013). Porter
et al. (2007) suggest that the perceived differences in human
and other species olfactory capabilities might be due to the
anatomical adaptation of bipedality and not a direct reflection
of olfactory ability. The current study argues men may be able
to detect odor changes related to the physiological status of
women, and this may explain subsequent behavioral and phy-
siological changes in men.
In a number of animals, including some primates, chemicals
have been shown to advertise female ovulation and affect male
mating behavior (Miller & Maner, 2011). These chemicals are
referred to as pheromones. Pheromones are defined as chemi-
cals released from an organisms' body into the environment
that result in certain responses, both physiological and beha-
vioral, in conspecifics. Some well-known physiological
responses in mammals to pheromones include the Lee-Boot
effect, the Bruce effect, and the Whitten effect (Grammer
et al., 2005).
Cummins et al. (2011) reported a striking example of intra-
sexual aggression induced via a pheromone produced by
female squid. A protein, Loligo b-microsemino, synthesized
by female squid causes male squid upon contact to rapidly
change from a calm state to one of extreme aggression, result-
ing in the exhibition of fighting displays. In their natural envi-
ronment, female squid produces this protein and inserts it into
the outer portion of the egg capsule. Males are attracted to egg
capsules visually and upon contact with Loligo b-microsemino,
become aggressive. Male­male competition ensues and the
female squid benefits from the acquisition of the victor's
sperm. Laboratory studies showed that the presence of Loligo
b-microsemino without a female or egg capsules present was
enough to trigger behavioral shift in males. Loligo b-microse-
mino is related, albeit distantly, to a protein represented in
female mammalian reproductive secretions.
In some primate species, females produce vaginal secretions
that may influence males behaviorally and hormonally.
Michael and Keverne (1970) reported that estrogen stimulated
some primates to produce vaginal secretions containing a
chain of five volatile aliphatic acids: acetic, propanoic,
methylpropanoic, butanoic, and methylbutanoic. This mixture
of fatty acids, called copulins, could potentially be classified
as a pheromone, since they are produced vaginally and trigger
certain behavioral and physiological reactions in conspecifics
(Grammer et al., 2005).
Copulins were first identified within the vaginal secretions
of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta; Michael & Zumpe,
1982). Copulins are registered by male rhesus monkeys
through olfaction and affect mate choice. Michael and Zumpe
(1982) placed four bilaterally ovariectomized females into a
social group with one male. Testosterone was administered to
two of the females causing them to be more receptive to
approach and mounting attempts. One of the testosterone
treated females was also treated with synthetic copulins, while
the other was treated with ether. Female treatments were
altered every trial to control for male mate-choice bias. The
results indicated that copulins significantly increased mounting
attempts and ejaculations. This suggests copulins act as a sig-
nificant olfactory stimulus affecting male rhesus monkey mat-
ing behavior by allowing them to discriminate, which females
in a social group are ovulating (Michael & Zumpe, 1982).
A similar study was conducted with stump-tailed macaques
(Macaca arctoides). Female stump-tailed macaques lack sex-
ual swellings, yet males have been shown to discriminatorily
engage in copulatory behavior with females during the perio-
vulatory phase. Vaginal secretions were collected throughout
the five menstrual phases, and males were exposed to cotton
2 Evolutionary Psychology
swabs soaked in these secretions or salt water. Upon returning
to the home cage, males exposed to secretions from the ovula-
tory phase showed increased exploratory and coercive sexual
behaviors (Cerda-Molina, Hernandez-Lopez, Rojas-Maya,
Murcia-Mejia, & Mondragon-Ceballos, 2006).
Matsumoto-Oda et al. (2003) identified a chain of six vola-
tile fatty acids: mucus, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid,
iso-butyric acid, and valeric acid in the vaginal secretions of
chimpanzees. Four captive female chimpanzees were observed
throughout their cycles. One female exhibited significantly
higher levels of acetic and propionic acids in her vaginal secre-
tions. She was also the only female to be followed by a male
and impregnated during the study. Levels of acetic and propio-
nic acids were stable across all the female's cycles. Only the
concentration of iso-butyric acid fluctuated throughout the
menstrual cycle. This finding suggests that iso-butyric acid
may act as a signal or cue to reproductive status. The other
acids, specifically acetic and propionic, may play a role in
advertising overall genetic quality and fecundity.
Cross-species comparisons between humans and primates
that exhibit sexual swelling or seasonal breeding patterns sug-
gest that ovulatory cues have been lost in humans. However,
women do display some cues related to their reproductive sta-
tus such as behavioral shifts. Grammer, Renninger, and Fischer
(2004) reported that ovulating nonpill using women at night
clubs in Vienna danced more provocatively, showed more skin,
and self-rated their outfit choices as sexier and bolder. They
interpreted their results to imply women consciously display
social signals with their clothing choices. Men report their
perception of a woman as a partner is altered by her clothing
choice. Women models showing more skin are reported as
attractive for a sexual partner but less attractive as a long-
term mate (Grammer, Renninger, & Fischer, 2004). Other
research shows that near ovulation, women report an increased
preference for men, other than their partner, that possess more
symmetrical bodies and immunocompatible odors (Singh &
Bronstad, 2001). Grammer, Fink, and Neave (2005) found that
13.8% of unprotected extrapair copulations happened during
ovulation. According to parental investment and sexual selec-
tion, women should be seeking both good genes and good
parental partners. Women may form pair bonds with more
parentally investing partners and sneak extrapair copulations
during ovulation with men exhibiting sexy genes. Sperm com-
petition will improve the overall genetic quality of a woman's
offspring, as the ``best'' sperm will impregnate her egg (Gram-
mer et al., 2004; Trivers, 1972). Similar research demonstrates
that women not only exhibit behavioral shifts but also shift in
physical appearance throughout their cycles.
Symmetry is selected for in many species as an indicator of
overall genetic quality. For example, fluctuating asymmetry in
plants is a product of sexual selection and involved in signaling
to pollinators (MØller & Eriksson, 1994). Human mating stra-
tagems may correlate with symmetry, in that higher symmetry,
men are likely to develop short-term mating strategies and
asymmetrical men are likely to develop long-term mating stra-
tegies (Haselton & Gangestad, 2006). The sexy genes discussed
in previous paragraphs is a reference to symmetry, among other
factors (Grammer et al., 2004; Trivers, 1972). Women exhibit
fluctuating asymmetry in relation to the menstrual cycle
(Roberts et al., 2004). Soft tissues (ears, fingers, and breast)
become more symmetrical during ovulation (Manning, Scutt,
Whitehouse, Leinster, & Walton, 1996). Other subtle shifts in a
woman's physical features include lighter facial skin pigmen-
tation, improved waist-to-hip ratio, and fluctuations in vocal
pitch (Miller & Maner, 2011; Van den Berghe & Frost, 1986).
Men judge photos of a woman not using hormonal contracep-
tives as more attractive during the follicular phase and less
attractive during the luteal phase, suggesting that men may use
fluctuating asymmetry as a cue to reproductive status (Roberts
et al., 2004).
Miller, Tybur, and Jordan (2007) found that nonpill using
lap dancers earned US$350 in tips while ovulating compared to
US$260 in the luteal phase and US$185 during menstruation.
One hypothesis based on behavioral differences suggests the
discrepancy in earnings is due to more flirtation and provoca-
tive dancing during ovulation. Another hypothesis suggests
men are unconsciously detecting olfactory cues to the physio-
logical status of the dancer (Haselton & Gangestad, 2006;
Haselton & Gildersleeve, 2011).
Michael, Bonsall, and Kutner (1975) examined vaginal
secretions throughout the menstrual cycle of 50 young women
via a tampon method. Their findings show that humans produce
the same copulins as nonhuman primates and that copulins
increase in concentration significantly during high fertility
phases and decrease during low fertility phases. Before enter-
ing into a discussion on chemical communication via copulins
in humans, it is worth mentioning that copulins could be a
byproduct of shared phylogeny with nonhuman primates and
of little importance in modern society. This will be brought up
again in the discussion of future research (see the Section Dis-
cussion of Men's Behavior in Response to Copulin Exposure).
Michael et al. (1975) found that women using oral contracep-
tives were clearly distinguishable from normal cycling women
because the overall content of fatty acids in their vaginal secre-
tions was low and there was no alteration in concentrations
throughout their menstrual cycle. Acetic acid was the most
dominant acid found in the participants' vaginal secretions,
which is congruent with chimpanzee vaginal secretion findings
(Matsumoto-Oda et al., 2003). In the chimpanzee study
described earlier, researchers suggested that acetic and propio-
nic acid signal overall female genetic quality because of their
relatively stable concentrations across the menstrual cycle. Iso-
butyric acid, on the other hand, fluctuates throughout the men-
strual cycle, and these fluctuations may be detected by males
(Matsumoto-Oda et al., 2003). Acetic acid in human vaginal
secretions is also relatively stable across the menstrual cycle
and has a high threshold for olfaction. Thus, acetic acid,
although the most dominate, contributes the least to vaginal
odor. Waltman et al. (1973) reported iso-butyric acid, which
typically fluctuates the most in human vaginal secretions across
the menstrual cycle, decreases in production by postmenopau-
sal women. Postmenopausal women do not ovulate and
Williams and Jacobson 3
subsequently do not need to secrete an acid that plays a role
signaling reproductive status. Thus, changes in men's behavior
and perceptions surrounding an ovulating woman may not be
solely due to changes in her behavior and fluctuating asymme-
try but also related to fluctuations in concentrations of copulins,
specifically iso-butyric acid, in her vaginal secretions.
Many studies show men are able to distinguish nonovulating
women from ovulating women via scent alone. In one example
of a classic smelly T-shirt study, nonpill using women in both
the luteal and follicular phases wore t-shirts to bed for three
days in a row. Afterward, men judged the scent of these T-shirts.
Results indicated that men preferred the scent of women in the
follicular phase. They rated those T-shirts as the most pleasant
and sexy smelling (Singh & Bronstad, 2001).
Miller and Maner (2010) took hormonal measurements after
exposing men to T-shirts worn by ovulating and nonovulating
women. Men exposed to T-shirts worn by ovulating women
exhibited a significant increase in testosterone. Testosterone
has been implicated in, among other things, aggressive beha-
viors like competiveness and dominance. These are traits that
may be valued by women, especially during ovulation, and are
related to intrasexual aggression (Kenrick et al., 2009; Miller &
Maner, 2010). In the presence of an ovulating woman, we
suggest that men may be primed by copulins to compete with
each other and display aggression, similar to the effects of
Loligo b-microsemino in squid (Cummins et al., 2011). In a
series of follow-up studies, Miller and Maner (2011) had men
complete an emotional perception task after being exposed to
T-shirts worn by ovulating and nonovulating women. Men in
the ovulating condition reported higher levels of sexual arousal
and were more likely to complete a word stem to form a sexual
word. They also rated the sexual interest of a female confed-
erate significantly greater than men in the nonovulating condi-
tion. In a separately run study, Miller and Maner (2011) had
participants interact with a confederate, while she was at a
high-conception risk or low-conception risk. Men were
accessed on how often they mimicked her body language and
their risk taking in a black jack game the confederate watched.
Men in the ovulating condition were more likely to mimic the
confederate's posture and make riskier decisions (Miller &
Maner, 2011).
Doty, Ford, Preti, and Huggins (1975) found that on average
men and women rate preovulatory and ovulatory secretions as
weaker and less intense than secretions from other phases of the
menstrual cycle. Cerda-Molina, Hernandez-Lopez, De la O,
Chavira-Ramirez, and Mondragon-Ceballos (2013) provide evi-
dence that men exhibit endocrine changes specifically to
increased concentrations of chemicals in women's axillary and
vulvar secretions at ovulation. Axillary and vulvar scents from
high fertility phases increased cortisol and testosterone levels
with vulvar scents, creating a longer lasting changes. General
sexual interest also increased. Luteal vulvar scents were rated as
intense and unpleasant compared to the other scents. These stud-
ies as well as others presented above show that men are sensitive
to high fertility and low fertility odors, but these studies do not
isolate copulins as the potential chemical mechanism.
Ju
¨tte and Grammer (1997) exposed men to copulins, while
having them rate the attractiveness of women's faces. Hormo-
nal measurements showed an increase in testosterone for men
in the copulin condition. Men in the copulin condition also
seemed inhibited in their ability to discriminate attractiveness,
meaning they rated all of the women's faces as significantly
more attractive than controls and exhibited a decrease in var-
iance of responses. A follow-up study replicated the hormonal
findings and indicated men exposed to copulins were less coop-
erative in a tragedy of the commons paradigm than controls
(Steinbach, Oberzaucher, & Grammer, 2012).
In our study, we causally tested whether copulin exposure
increased men's mate-guarding behavior, ratings of women's
attractiveness, and self-perceived sexual desirability. We
sought to replicate Ju
¨tte and Grammer (1997) by exposing men
to synthetic copulins while having them rate photographs of
women's faces. Prior research has focused on behavioral shifts
and fluctuating asymmetry as subtle cues to human ovulation.
Yet we know, olfaction and chemical signaling play an impor-
tant role in social interactions and mating behavior in diverse
animal taxa. The relevance of this in primates, specifically
humans, has been discounted, as human sensory evolution has
been characterized by increased optical primacy. However, a
profusion of recent studies challenges this view. Our study will
add to this growing body of research and try to answer the
question: What functions does olfaction play, if any, in human
mating psychology?
Material and Method
Participants
One hundred heterosexual men were recruited from advertise-
ments posted around the campuses of Rutgers University, New
Brunswick. The study involved deception as advertisements
described the study as collecting hormonal measurements and
measuring mating preferences. No hormonal measures were
collected, and participants were debriefed afterward. Partici-
pants were paid US$20 upon completion of the study but were
informed suspension of the study at any time would not effect
their collection of the full participation payment. Demographic
information, beyond age (M ¼ 20.7, SD ¼ 4.1) and relationship
status (Single ¼ 69%, Committed Relationship ¼ 31%), was
not collected in order to make participants feel less identifiable.
This study was approved by the Rutgers University's Institu-
tional Review Board.
Procedure
Participants reported for a single session and were equally
divided into two conditions, control and copulin. Control data
were collected prior to experimental data. The composition of
the synthetic copulin solution was 78.38% acetic acid, 13.21%
propanoic acid, 4.94% butanoic acid, 0.76% methylpropanoic
acid, and 2.14% methylbutanoic acid diluted with distilled
water to a concentration of 0.08 per ml. The acid percentages
4 Evolutionary Psychology
are from the concentrations of acids recorded during ovulation
in Michael et al. (1975). All subsequent studies with copulins
have used these concentrations (Ju
¨tte & Grammer, 1997; Stein-
bach et al., 2012). The solution was stored in a glass bottle at
þ4C until participants entered the lab. At this time, 5 ml of the
solution, or distilled water, were used to coat a gauze pad
pinned to the inside of an Uline surgical mask. The solution
was applied using a plastic pipette stored at room temperature.
Subjects were instructed to wear the treated masks for the
entirety of their participation.
Measures: Ratings of Attractiveness
Ten photographs of makeup-less women's faces were used to
test previous research that indicated exposure to copulins inhi-
bits men's ability to discriminate attractiveness in women's
faces (Ju
¨tte & Grammer, 1997). Stimuli were randomized, and
participants rated each stimulus on a 5-point Likert-type scale,
with 1 being not attractive and 5 being very attractive.
Measures: Self-Perceived Sexual Desirability
Assessment of self-perceived sexual desirability was measured
by asking participants to rate on a 5-point Likert-type scale,
with 0 being not very likely and 4 being definitely would, the
photographed woman's desire to have sex with them.
Measures: Mate Guarding
Mate guarding was assessed using a modified version of the
Mate Retention Inventory (Buss, Shackelford, & McKibbin,
2008). We modified the inventory by reducing the number of
questions and deleting the time frame of within the past year.
The question reduction was due to time constraints. We
removed Questions 4, 7, 9­13, 16, 19, 23, 25, 26, 28­33, and
36 as we thought these would show the least variance between
conditions. The original time frame was eliminated and instead
we prompted participants to think of how they behaved in any
serious relationship over their lifetime. We thought this would
give us a more accurate measure of mate-guarding behavior
between conditions as our sample size was too small to analyze
differences between single men and men in relationships (see
the Section Limitations).
Results and Discussion
Mate guarding
We calculated a mate-guarding score by averaging responses
on our modified version of the Mate Retention Inventory; the
modified version had good internal consistency, a ¼ .82. We
then analyzed this using a between-subjects t-test. There was
no difference in mate-guarding scores between the control
(M ¼ 1.2, SD ¼ 0.5) and copulin (M ¼ 1.3, SD ¼ 0.5) condi-
tions, t(98) ¼ À.66, p ¼ .511 (see Figure 1).
Attractiveness Ratings
We analyzed ratings of facial attractiveness using a mixed-
model analysis of variance (ANOVA), with condition as a
between-subject factor and the different faces as a within-
subject factor. There was a trending difference between the
control and copulin condition, F(1, 97) ¼ 3.26, p ¼ .074, partial
Z2 ¼ .03; facial attractiveness ratings were higher in the copu-
lin condition (M ¼ 2.4, SD ¼ 0.6) than in the control condition
(M ¼ 2.1, SD ¼ 0.6).
We next tested if men exposed to copulins were less dis-
criminating when rating facial attractiveness by calculating a
variance across ratings for each participant; this was analyzed
with a between-subjects t-test. There was no difference
between the control and copulin, t(97) ¼ À1.27, p ¼ .209;
variance across ratings were similar in the control (M ¼ 0.72,
SD ¼ 0.39) and copulin (M ¼ 0.81, SD ¼ 0.39; see Figure 1),
suggesting men exposed to copulins were equally discriminat-
ing when ratings facial attractiveness.
Self-Perceived Sexual Desirability
We analyzed ratings of self-perceived sexual desirability using
a mixed-model ANOVA, with condition as a between-subject
factor and the different faces as a within-subject factor. There
was a significant difference between the control and copulin
condition, F(1, 97) ¼ 4.26, p ¼ .042, partial Z2 ¼ .04; men
rated themselves as more sexually desirable in the copulin
condition (M ¼ 2.3, SD ¼ 0.9) than in the control condition
(M ¼ 1.9, SD ¼ 0.9; see Figure 1).
Discussion of Men's Behavior in Response to
Copulin Exposure

copulin condition than in the control condition. There was no
difference in variance of responses between the copulin and
control condition. Although our data were trending, we do not
have statistical evidence to report a replication of Ju
¨tte and
Grammer (1997). This may be due to small sample size and
small number of visual stimuli (see Section Limitations).
There are different hypotheses that could explain why
copulins, if they do, have an effect on men's ability to dis-
criminate women's attractiveness. One may take into account
Anisogamy, Sexual Selection, and Parental Investment The-
ory, which together explain men having a low cost and high
benefit from copulating with any woman may find it advan-
tageous to detect a cue to women's physiological status and
mate with any woman that is ovulating. Thus, when exposed
to the concentrations of copulins produced at ovulation, men
may be placed in a mating mind-set, where all women are
now attractive. A follow-up study may look at whether men
respond differently to different concentrations of copulins as
well as whether we can distinguish the specific acid(s) cor-
relating to overall genetic quality and fecundability or the
acid(s) acting as the olfactory cue to physiological status as
suggested in the Female Quality Hypothesis (Matsumoto-Oda
et al. (2003)).
An alternative way of viewing copulins is that of a signal.
Women may be using copulins to signal their physiological
status and manipulate men into finding them more attractive
and thus of high mate quality. Future studies should also look at
attractiveness ratings of full-body photographs as research sug-
gests waist-to-hip ratio is also an indicator of conception risk
(Kirchengast & Gartner, 2002). Are men exposed to copulins
less discriminatory? If copulins are a signal, our finding that
men under the influence of copulins rate themselves as more
sexually desirable to women is quite puzzling. It may further
suggest an arms race between the sexes. Perhaps women use
copulins to manipulate men into finding them more attractive
and as counter strategy men have adapted an increased
self-perception of their own mate quality, effectively canceling
out the woman's strategy of increased attractiveness.
Other hypotheses may be that copulins are a byproduct of
our shared ancestry with nonhuman primates or that copulins
are a signal and a cue. Perhaps women use copulins to signal to
high-quality mates or to their partner when they are ovulating
to increase chances of successful copulation. In turn, low-
quality mates may use copulins as a cue to women's physiolo-
gical status. Future studies may examine the differences in low-
quality and high-quality men's sensitivity to copulins and what
these differences, if any, may mean.
Analyses of our data produced a null result for mate guard-
ing. The copulin and control conditions did not differ in their
amount of mate guarding. Again, this result may be due to
design flaws. The majority of our participants were single
(69%). In the control condition, 16 participants reported being
in a committed relationship and only 15 participants in the
copulin condition likewise reported being in a committed rela-
tionship. Future studies should look at the difference between
men in committed relationships between conditions, but the
sample size of this study was simply too small to adequately
determine any relationship and thus not worth reporting. Men
in relationships should utilize cues to or signals of their part-
ner's physiological status in order to prevent mate infidelity or
coordination in timing copulation, but single men are not
strongly motivated to mate guard. Although our findings on
mate guarding are null, we do think it worth investigating more
in future studies as our study design was a severe limitation,
particularly to this finding.
As mentioned previously, our results do support the
hypothesis that men exposed to copulins perceive themselves
as more sexually desirable to women. Again, this raises some
interesting questions that may get at the differences between
signals and cues. Are women producing copulins to signal
they are ovulating. If so, why did they develop this mixed
strategy? Are men detecting copulins as a cue to ovulation
and using this information to precisely time when to increase
mate-guarding behaviors? Are copulins simply a byproduct of
shared phylogeny? Research on olfactory influences of human
mating behavior is underwhelming. The studies that do exist
fail to differentiate between signals and cues. This discrepancy
will produce vastly different interpretations of any results, and
future studies will need to determine how copulins should be
classified.
Limitations
The current study had a number of limitations. Participants
were not asked if they smoked, were suffering from a congested
nose, or had any known medical issues affecting olfactory
capability. Future studies should eliminate any participants that
exhibit behaviors potentially leading to olfactory loss or have
any known olfactory problems.
Sample size was too small to determine any meaningful
findings with regard to mate guarding and relationship status.
Small sample size and small number of visual stimuli may also
account for the differences in our findings and Ju
¨tte and Gram-
mer (1997). Mate-guarding behaviors were assessed using self-
report, which is invariably a limitation. Interviews or a com-
parison between the participant's self-reported behaviors and
how their partner scored their behaviors on the same survey, at
high- and low-conception risk, may be more insightful. The use
of actual sensory stimuli may also provide a better measure of
mate-guarding behavior when using a random sample of men,
the majority of which are single. Seeing or reading a situation
and having participants record their reaction may provide more
accurate information as to what actions, mate-guarding or else-
wise, a participant would adopt in a given situation. A reviewer
also brought to our attention that removing the time frame on
the Mate Retention Inventory may also be a limitation, and
future research should use a measure more sensitive to imme-
diate experimental manipulation.
Follow-up designs should also be double blind to eliminate
potential researcher and participant biases. Future studies also
need to take learned association into account. Copulins could
be a pheromone, or the effects of copulins may be due to a
6 Evolutionary Psychology
learned association between the smell of copulins and sexual
arousal. Future studies should look at the sexual history of
participants as a potential mediator. Perhaps only sexually
active heterosexual men are effected by copulins. Chemical
communication via copulins may also be a byproduct of our
shared evolution with nonhuman primates and of little impor-
tance in modern society. Follow-up designs should employ
scent masking tactics to see if men are still sensitive to copu-
lins. Modern hygienic habits and the use of personal deodorant
and perfumes could negate any influence copulins may have on
men's behavior and physiology.
Implications and Future Research
Copulins have implications for human mate choice, behavioral
strategies, infertility, and sexual coercion. Waltman et al.
(1973) found that postmenopausal women show a significant
decrease in concentrations of iso-butyric acid in their vaginal
secretions. Future research should assess the potential of iso-
butyric acid in signaling or cueing female ovulation. Future
research should examine the relationship between fecundity
and copulin concentrations as well as how socioeconomic sta-
tus effect copulin production. Women with unrestricted socio-
sexuality may produce higher concentrations of copulins as
compared to women in less favorable conditions.
Primate studies show exposure to ovulating females causes
males to exhibit sexually coercive behaviors (Cerda-Molina
et al., 2006). Human studies have shown synthetic copulin expo-
sure increases men's testosterone levels and decreases their
cooperative behaviors (Steinbach, Oberzaucher, & Grammer,
2012). Thus, women may be at a greater risk of direct aggressive
behaviors perpetrated by men during ovulation. And indeed
studies show that women may be aware of this increased risk.
Women are more risk aversive at high conception risk than low
conception risk (Chavanne & Gallup, 1998). Women at high
conception risk, but not low conception risk, display greater
handgrip strength in response to sexual assault vignettes but
not in response to control vignettes (Petralia & Gallup, 2002).
This could have implications for domestic violence and date
rape and would be an interesting area for future research.
There has been no research looking at the effects of copulins
on other women. Future research questions may include
whether women show greater intrasexual aggression and anti-
mate poaching behaviors when exposed to copulins. Future
research may also look at the sensitivity of homosexual women
to copulins.
As previously mentioned, olfaction is an understudied area of
human mating leaving open many questions for future research.
Any finding will spawn multiple new research questions, and the
interactions between these findings and known olfactory influ-
ences, like major histocompatibility, will need interpreting.
Conclusion
Previous research indicates exposure to copulins results in hor-
monal changes, inhibits male ability to discriminate the
attractiveness of women's faces, and decreases men's cooper-
ation (Ju
¨tte & Grammer, 1997; Steinbach et al., 2012). Our
study did not replicate Ju
¨tte and Grammer (1997); however,
the data were trending toward significance. Men in the copulin
condition did assign a higher average attractiveness rating for
each woman's face than controls. Our mate-guarding data pro-
duced null results. We did find that men in the copulin condi-
tion rated themselves as significantly more sexually desirable
to women than men in the control condition. These findings
provide extremely limited evidence for copulins exerting some
effect on men's behavior. However limited, these results are
significant in setting the groundwork for future studies on puta-
tive human pheromones and provide some empirical evidence
for olfactory influences on human mating. There are many
critics of human pheromone research and this has led to some
confusion in the general public about whether humans produce
and detect pheromones. Although the scope of the current study
is not adequate to dispel this skepticism, as associative learning
was not tested, future research will address this question. The
significance of this research area extends beyond academia, as
some commercial perfumes capitalize on the notion of phero-
mones and increasing sexual desirability. Thus, the dissemina-
tion of empirical evidence for or against the role of putative
human pheromones will be vital in the future.
