Existing research on the adverse health effects of exposure to pollution has devoted relatively little attention to the
potential impact of ambient air pollution on cognitive function in older adults. We examined the cross-sectional as-
sociation between residential concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 m or less
(PM2.5
) and cognitive function in older adults. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we analyzed data from the
2004 Health and Retirement Study, a large, nationally representative sample of US adults aged 50 years or
older. We linked participant data with 2000 US Census tract data and 2004 census tract­level annual average
PM2.5
concentrations. Older adults living in areas with higher PM2.5
concentrations had worse cognitive function
( = -0.26, 95% confidence interval: -0.47, -0.05) even after adjustment for community- and individual-level social
and economic characteristics. Results suggest that the association is strongest for the episodic memory component
of cognitive function. This study adds to a growing body of research highlighting the importance of air pollution to
cognitive function in older adults. Improving air quality in large metropolitan areas, where much of the aging US
population resides, may be an important mechanism for reducing age-related cognitive decline.

Research suggests that exposure to ambient air pollution is
associated with a number of adverse health effects. Small-
particle air pollution (<10 m in diameter) is especially harm-
ful to health because, once inhaled, particles can travel
through the circulatory system and ultimately cause damage
to organs, such as the heart, lungs, and brain (1). Chronic ex-
posure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution has been
linked to elevated risks of cardiovascular diseases, respira-
tory diseases, and death (2­4). Emerging research suggests
that exposure to air pollution may also be harmful to brain
health and functioning (5). Studies of animals and humans
have found an association between exposure to high concen-
trations of PM air pollution and both increased brain inflam-
mation and accumulation of -amyloid, a marker of neuronal
dysfunction (6­8). Individuals experiencing air pollutant­
induced inflammation and neurodegeneration may be more
likely to develop cognitive deficits (9) and may have greater
risk for experiencing progressive neurodegenerative diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease.
Older adults are especially susceptible to the adverse car-
diovascular and respiratory outcomes associated with par-
ticulate air pollution (10, 11). However, relatively little is
known about the relationship between PM exposure and cog-
nitive function in older adults. Prior studies have found that
older adults living in close proximity to a major road, a mea-
sure of exposure to traffic-related PM, have worse cognitive
function (12, 13). Studies of particulate matter with an aero-
dynamic diameter of 10 m or less reported no association
with cognitive function (12, 14). However, in a study that ex-
amined the coarse (aerodynamic diameter 2.5­10 m) and
fine (aerodynamic diameter 2.5 m) components of PM
separately, higher levels of residential exposure to both com-
ponents were associated with worse cognitive decline (15).
Furthermore, exposure to higher concentrations of black

carbon, a component of PM2.5
, has been linked to worse cog-
nitive function in older adults (13, 16).
There is increasing evidence that particulate air pollution,
such as PM2.5
, may play a significant role in neurodegenera-
tion. To our knowledge, there is no existing research on the
association between PM2.5
exposure and cognitive function
in a national sample of older US men and women. In this
paper, we use a nationally representative sample of community-
dwelling older adults to explore the hypothesis that living in
areas with higher concentrations of PM2.5
is associated with
worse cognitive function, even after adjustment for individual-
level risk factors and community-level social and economic
characteristics.
METHODS
Data
We used data from the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS), a longitudinal and nationally representative study of
US adults aged 50 years or older. The study sample was ob-
tained using a stratified, multistage area probability sample
design with oversampling of African Americans, Hispanics,
and Floridians. Respondent information was obtained from
the RAND HRS data file, version L, which is produced by
the RAND Center for the Study of Aging (Santa Monica,
California), with funding from the National Institute on
Aging (Baltimore, Maryland) and the Social Security
Administration (Woodlawn, Maryland). We used data from
the 2004 HRS survey, which included 18,575 community-
dwelling adults aged 50 years or older. We excluded 1,441
respondents with a history of stroke, as well as 86 respon-
dents who were missing data on individual-level covariates.
Respondents who lived in census tracts that were not within
60 km of an air monitoring station (n = 1,718) or who could
not be geocoded to a census tract (n = 297) were not included
in the analysis, because their exposures to PM2.5
could not be
ascertained. In addition, 1,222 respondents who had a proxy
complete the interview, and thus whose cognitive function
was not directly assessed, were excluded from the analytical
sample. Implications of missing PM2.5
and cognitive data are
discussed in more detail in the results section. The final ana-
lytical sample consisted of 13,996 men and women aged 50
years or older.
Air pollution data came from the US Environmental Pro-
tection Agency's (EPA's) Air Quality System, a national net-
work of air monitoring stations that collects data on air
pollutants. Data on census tract­level air pollution for 2004
were obtained from RAND's Center for Population Health
and Health Disparities Data Core Series (17). Measures of
census tract­level social and economic characteristics are
from the 2000 census. Pollution and census data were linked
to HRS respondents using census tract identifiers.
Measures
Cognitive function. The HRS measure of cognitive func-
tion is based on the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status
(18) and has been validated for use in population surveys
conducted in person and by telephone (19). Approximately
72% of the sample received the cognitive assessment in
face-to-face interviews, and the remainder completed the as-
sessment by telephone. Cognitive function was assessed on a
35-point scale that sums scores on immediate and delayed
10-noun free-recall tests to measure memory, a serial 7 sub-
traction test to measure working memory, a backwards count-
ing test to measure processing speed, recall of the date and
name of the president and vice president to measure orienta-
tion, and an object naming test to measure knowledge and
language. Participants under age 65 years were not assessed
on the orientation and object naming tests because the
"young old" generally answer all items correctly. To con-
struct a total cognitive function score for all respondents,
we assigned full points on these tests to those younger than
65 years.
We also created measures for 2 separate components of
cognitive function measured in the HRS: episodic memory
and mental status. The numbers of correctly recalled words
in the immediate and delayed recall tests were summed to cre-
ate a total episodic memory score that ranges from 0 to 20.
Correct answers on the remaining tests were summed to cre-
ate a mental status score that ranges from 0 to 15. Previous
analysis of cognition in the HRS suggests that episodic mem-
ory and mental status represent 2 distinct factors and should
be investigated separately (19).
Air pollution. Census tract­specific concentrations of
PM2.5
in 2004 were derived using 24-hour daily means re-
ported by monitors within a 60-km radius of each census
tract centroid. Values from each monitoring station were
weighted using the inverse of the distance from the census
tract centroid to the location of the monitor to give greater
importance to values reported by monitors closer to the re-
spondents' census tracts. The daily means were then aggre-
gated to create the tract-level 2004 annual average PM2.5
concentration.
Covariates. Individual-level covariates include socio-
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, as well as
smoking status. Sociodemographic information included
age, sex, and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Hispanic, other). Socioeconomic measures
included educational attainment, which was assessed as the
highest completed grade of school or year of college; current
employment status; and logged household income and
wealth. Smoking behavior was included (never smoker, for-
mer smoker, current smoker). Census tract­level covariates
include the proportion of residents aged 25 years or older
without a high school degree and median household income
(logged).
Analytical strategy
We used multilevel linear regression models to examine
the association between PM2.5
and cognitive function. On av-
erage, there were 3 sample members living in a tract (13,996
respondents living in 4,577 tracts), with only 13% of sample
members living in a singleton tract (i.e., a tract with no other
sample members). Thus, most sample members were clus-
tered in tracts and, therefore, had similar ambient air pollu-
tion exposures. We used multilevel models to account for
the clustering of respondents within census tracts (20). For

both the total cognitive function score and the 2 subcompo-
nents, 3 models are presented. Model 1 includes adjustments
for tract-level covariates and individual sociodemographic
characteristics. Model 2 adds individual socioeconomic sta-
tus. Model 3 adds smoking status. Analyses were conducted
using Stata, version 12, software (StataCorp LP, College Sta-
tion, Texas) and HLM, version 6.06, software (Scientific
Software International, Inc., Skokie, Illinois). In all analyses,
we used sample weights that adjust for differential sampling
probabilities and nonresponse and make the sample represent-
ative of the older US population.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows individual-level characteristics of the sam-
ple. The average age of the sample was 64 years. There were
more women than men, most were non-Hispanic white, and
their average educational attainment was just above high
school level. Average income and wealth showed consider-
able variability in this sample. Just more than half of the sam-
ple was not working, and most did not smoke. The average
cognitive function score was approximately 24, which is in
the normal range.
Because the association between cognitive function and
PM2.5
appeared to be nonlinear, we divided PM2.5
into quar-
tiles. PM2.5
ranged from 4.5 to 20.7 g/m3 (mean = 12.0 g/
m3) in the tracts in which respondents lived. PM2.5
ranged
from 4.500 to 9.942 g/m3 in the first and lowest quartile,
9.943 to 12.184 g/m3 in the second quartile, 12.185 to
13.796 g/m3 in the third quartile, and 13.797 to 20.661 g/m3
in the fourth and highest quartile. The national ambient air
qualitystandard, which is determined by the EPA (Washington,
DC) to be the level at which there is increased risk to human
health, is 12 g/m3 for PM2.5
. Nearly half of sample members
live in areas where PM2.5
concentrations exceed the air qual-
ity standard.
The distribution of sample characteristics is shown sepa-
rately for each PM2.5
quartile in Table 2. The proportion of
residents with less than a high school degree is higher in
more polluted areas. However, residents in more polluted
areas also have higher average income than those in less pol-
luted areas. Those living in more polluted areas were younger
and less likely to be white. Education and income show a cur-
vilinear relationship with PM2.5
, suggesting that those with
the highest levels of education and income lived in both the
least and most polluted areas. A higher percentage of those
living in the most polluted quartiles were not working and
were current smokers. Cognitive function was lower among
those living in areas with higher exposure.
Table 3 presents the multilevel regression models of cog-
nitive function. Model 1 shows the association between
PM2.5
and cognitive function after adjustment for tract-level
covariates and individual sociodemographic characteristics.
Cognitive function is lower in the top 3 quartiles of exposure
compared with the lowest quartile. However, the largest
difference is seen between the lowest and third quartiles
( = -0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.80, -0.36).
Model 2 further adjusts for individual socioeconomic charac-
teristics. The difference between the first and second quartiles
of exposure is no longer statistically significant, and the size

of the coefficient for the third quartile is reduced by about
26%. The difference between the association of PM2.5
with
cognitive function was further reduced in model 3 after ac-
counting for smoking status, but statistically significant dif-
ferences remain between those in the lowest quartile of
exposure and those in the third ( = -0.43, 95% CI: -0.63,
-0.23) and highest ( = -0.26, 95% CI: -0.47, -0.05) quar-
tiles. Although the coefficient for the fourth quartile of expo-
sure is smaller than that for the third quartile, the difference is
not statistically significant ( = -0.17, 95% CI: -0.37, 0.03).
We also examined the association between PM2.5
and 2
subcomponents of cognitive function: episodic memory
and mental status. Results are shown in Table 4, but for brev-
ity, we show only coefficients for quartiles of PM2.5
exposure
(full model results are available upon request). Each model in
Table 4 includes the covariates of the corresponding model in
Table 3. Living in more polluted areas is associated with
worse episodic memory after adjustment for individual-
and neighborhood-level factors. Those living in more pol-
luted areas also had worse performance on tasks representing
mental status, but the association is only marginally signifi-
cant (P < 0.10) after adjustment for individual socioeconomic
characteristics.
Secondary analyses
We conducted several additional analyses that are not
shown here but are available upon request. First, because res-
idents' exposure to ambient air pollution may depend on the
total number of years they have lived in an area, we examined
models that adjusted for the length of time at residence. We
observed the same pattern of results as those presented in
Tables 3 and 4. The results were also unchanged with the
inclusion of indicators of health that could be potentially

and
cognitive function, including body mass index (weight (kg)/
height (m)2) and doctor diagnosed hypertension, heart attack,
diabetes, cancer, and lung disease.
Recognizing that some individuals may be especially vul-
nerable to PM air pollution, we examined interactions be-
tween PM2.5
and all covariates. We found no evidence of
interactions between PM2.5
, sociodemographic factors, or so-
cioeconomic factors (P for all interactions < 0.01). However,
interactions between PM2.5
and smoking status suggest that
current smokers in the second quartile of exposure had worse
cognitive function than nonsmokers in the same quartile and
either smokers or nonsmokers in the bottom quartile of expo-
sure (P for interaction = 0.04).
We also considered the potential influence of missing
PM2.5
and cognitive function data on the reported findings.
First, we performed logistic regressions using individual-
level sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables to
predict missingness of cognitive function data and PM2.5
data (i.e., 1 = missing, 0 = not missing). The following char-
acteristics were associated with having significantly higher
odds (P < 0.05) of missing cognitive data: greater PM2.5
ex-
posure, older age, male sex, "other" race/ethnicity, fewer
years of education, greater income, and currently being em-
ployed. Those with worse cognitive function, younger age,
male sex, non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity, and fewer
years of education were significantly more likely to have
missing PM2.5
data (P < 0.05).
Second, we performed sensitivity analyses using an im-
puted cognitive function score for those with a proxy inter-
view. We used an approach developed for the HRS that
uses proxy assessments and interviewer observations to
classify respondents as normal, cognitively impaired with
no dementia, or demented, and then we assigned proxy re-
spondents the median cognitive function score for each cate-
gory (for normal cognitive function (range, 11­35), median,

(21, 22). Inclusion of the proxy respondents with imputed
scores did not change the findings reported here. Although
we do not have information about PM2.5
exposure for indi-
viduals who do not live in close proximity to an air monitor,
we can assign these individualsto the lowest exposure quartile
under the assumption that the EPA does not place monitors in
areas with low PM2.5
concentrations. Assigning individuals
with missing PM2.5
data to the lowest quartile did not change
our findings.
DISCUSSION
In this cross-sectional study of older US men and women,
exposure to PM2.5
was associated with cognitive function
after adjustment for community social characteristics and
individual social, demographic, economic, and health charac-
teristics. We did not find a linear association between PM2.5
and cognitive function. Those living in areas with the highest
exposure in our sample did not have the worst cognitive func-
tion. Rather, the data indicate that living in areas with annual
PM2.5
concentrations that exceed EPA air quality standards is
harmful to older adults' cognition. To put our findings in per-
spective, we found that living in more polluted areas was as-
sociated with a decrease in cognitive function that is similar
to a 1.7- to 2.8-year difference in age in our data. We did not
find much support for effect modification by individual-level
characteristics. However, our results suggest that, at relatively
low PM2.5
concentrations, cognition may be worse among
older adults who smoke.
Separate analyses of 2 subcomponents of cognitive func-
tion suggest that it is episodic memory that is adversely af-
fected by exposure to PM2.5
. Episodic memory impairment
is 1 of the core diagnostic criteria used to determine mild cog-
nitive impairment and dementia in older adults (23), and it
has been suggested that impairments in this aspect of mem-
ory represent some of the earliest signs of dementia (24).
Thus, exposure to PM may have the most significance for
cognition in healthy older adults who have not yet demon-
strated cognitive impairment.
To our knowledge, this is 1 of only a handful of studies to
consider the association between air pollution and cognitive
function in older adults and the first to do so using a nation-
ally representative sample of older men and women. Most of
the existing evidence for a link between air pollution and cog-
nitive function comes from studies of younger populations (9,
25, 26). Yet there is now growing evidence of the importance
of air pollution for the aging brain, as well. This study adds to
existing research on air pollution and cognition in older
adults by demonstrating that the pollution-cognition link ob-
served in prior studies of select populations (12­16) is also
present in a broader sample of older US men and women.
The current study has several limitations. There were sub-
stantial missing data on both cognitive function and PM2.5
.
Because we excluded older adults who were institutionalized
or had proxy-assisted interviews, the study findings are some-
what biased toward a cognitively intact older adult popula-
tion. Our analysis of the characteristics of those with and
without cognitive data confirms that our analytical sample
differs in several ways from those with missing cognitive
data. However, our findings were unchanged after imputing
cognitive function for these individuals and including them
in the analytical sample. We also excluded from our analyses
those individuals for whom PM2.5
exposure could not be de-
termined. These individuals also differed in systematic ways
from the analytical sample. However, we found the same pat-
tern of results when we included those with missing PM2.5
data in the lowest exposure quartile.

We used a measure of outdoor pollution that may not
completely capture total individual exposure. Although out-
door pollution may be an important contributor to overall ex-
posure, pollution exposure may also occur in other contexts,
such as in the workplace or during daily road travel. How-
ever, most of our sample members were not employed, so
outdoor residential pollution concentrations may be a good
approximation of their total exposure. In addition, previous
research has found high correlations between outdoor
PM2.5
exposure and both indoor and personal PM2.5
exposure
(27). This is likely due to relatively small spatial variability in
PM2.5
concentrations within urban areas. Thus, even though
we use a measure of outdoor PM2.5
from pollution monitors,
we are also likely measuring a good portion of personal ex-
posure. Moreover, we did not have data on long-term pollu-
tion exposure, though our measure may reflect some degree
of longer-term air pollution. Pollution levels are highly cor-
related over time. Correlations of 0.98 and 0.94 have been
reported for PM2.5
measured in a given year and levels mea-
sured 1 and 4 years prior, respectively. PM2.5
measured in a
given year has also shown a high correlation ( = 0.89) with
estimated levels from 10 years prior (15).
This study examined cognition with respect to only the fine
fraction of PM and did not consider the coarse fraction of PM,
which has been linked to cognitive decline in prior research
(15). Although we found an association between PM2.5
and
cognitive function, we are not able to determine what compo-
nents of PM2.5
are primarily responsible for the association.
PM2.5
is a complex mixture of several components, including
carbon and metals (28), and it remains unclear which compo-
nent, or components, are responsible for the adverse health
effects of PM2.5
. Some research suggests that traffic-related
components are responsible for the health effects of PM2.5
(29). This is supported by studies of cognition that have
found associations with black carbon, a traffic-related com-
ponent of PM2.5
(13, 16).
Although we included a number of community- and
individual-level covariates in our models, we were unable
to account for other potentially important confounders, such
as diet and cognitive engagement, which are thought to be
key risk factors for poor cognitive function in old age. Fi-
nally, this study examined cross-sectional associations and,
thus, causal pathways between air pollution and cognitive
function in older adults cannot be determined. However, an
association between PM air pollution and cognitive decline
has been established in previous research using data from
the Nurses' Health Study (15).
The concern over the health effects of fine PM air pollution
is growing. Fine particles are small enough that they can pass
through the throat and nose and ultimately enter the lungs and
brain (30). Inhaled particulates can affect the respiratory and
cardiovascular systems, with potential consequences for vas-
cular pathology in the brain, and they may even directly cause
damage to brain structure and physiology. Studies of both
humans and animals have confirmed that exposure to PM is
linked to harmful changes in brain health and functioning.
The biological evidence, as well as findings from population-
based studies, including the study presented here, provides
further indication that air pollution plays an important role
in brain aging.
The population of older adults living in large metropolitan
areas is growing rapidly (31). Although air pollution levels
have declined in recent years (32), older residents of many
US cities continue to breathe air that is harmful to their
health. In 2013, the EPA lowered the air quality standard
for PM2.5
from 15 to 12 g/m3. Our study found that expo-
sure to PM2.5
concentrations below 15 g/m3 was associated
with worse cognition in older adults. Efforts to further reduce
PM2.5
concentrations in accordance with the recent EPA stan-
dard may have beneficial consequences for the cognitive
health of the aging US population.
