Objective: To examine the associations between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, obesity and
hypertension in young adults in a large population-based cohort.
Design, Setting and Participants: The study population consisted of 15 197 respondents from the National Longitudinal Study
of Adolescent Health, a nationally representative sample of adolescents followed from 1995 to 2009 in the United States.
Multinomial logistic and logistic models examined the odds of overweight, obesity and hypertension in adulthood in relation to
retrospectively reported ADHD symptoms. Latent curve modeling was used to assess the association between symptoms and
naturally occurring changes in body mass index (BMI) from adolescence to adulthood.
Results: Linear association was identified between the number of inattentive (IN) and hyperactive/impulsive (HI) symptoms and
waist circumference, BMI, diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure (all P-values for trend o0.05). Controlling for
demographic variables, physical activity, alcohol use, smoking and depressive symptoms, those with three or more HI or IN
symptoms had the highest odds of obesity (HI 3 þ , odds ratio (OR) ¼ 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) ¼ 1.22À2.83; IN 3 þ ,
OR ¼ 1.21, 95% CI ¼ 1.02À1.44) compared with those with no HI or IN symptoms. HI symptoms at the 3 þ level were
significantly associated with a higher OR of hypertension (HI 3 þ , OR ¼ 1.24, 95% CI ¼ 1.01À1.51; HI continuous, OR ¼ 1.04,
95% CI ¼ 1.00À1.09), but associations were nonsignificant when models were adjusted for BMI. Latent growth modeling results
indicated that compared with those reporting no HI or IN symptoms, those reporting 3 or more symptoms had higher initial
levels of BMI during adolescence. Only HI symptoms were associated with change in BMI.
Conclusion: Self-reported ADHD symptoms were associated with adult BMI and change in BMI from adolescence to adulthood,
providing further evidence of a link between ADHD symptoms and obesity.

Introduction
Globally, it is estimated that 1.6 billion adults are overweight
and 400 million are obese.1 What was once a public health
concern for high-income countries is now also a concern
among middle- and even low-income countries. The causes
of obesity range from biological susceptibility to socio-
environmental influence and the interaction among these
factors.2 Understanding both proximal and distal risk factors
for obesity are essential to developing targeted interventions.
There is evidence for increased comorbidity of non-
eating-related psychiatric disorders and obesity in children
and adults.3 Psychiatric conditions, such as depression
and post-traumatic stress disorder, have been associated
with obesity and related chronic diseases, such as hyperten-
sion.4­6 In addition, an increasing number of studies suggest
a link between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) and obesity.7 Studies of obese children and adults
in clinical settings have documented a higher than expected
prevalence of ADHD.8­11 Similarly, a marginally higher
prevalence of obesity has been observed among patients
with ADHD;12­15 however, this finding is not consistent
among all studies.16,17
In addition to these clinic-based studies, a small set of
population-based studies have investigated the link between
ADHD and obesity. One study using data from the National

Survey of Children's Health, a telephone survey conducted
with parents, found that childhood ADHD was associated
with an increased odds (1.5) of obesity in these children.18
Another study using the Collaborative Psychiatric Epide-
miology data set, combining three population-based surveys
from the United States, found that childhood ADHD
persisting into adulthood was associated with an increased
likelihood of overweight and obesity (1.58 and 1.81,
respectively), even after controlling for depression.19
Individuals in the population who exhibit high levels of
ADHD symptoms, independent of their clinical diagnosis,
are at higher risk for problematic health behaviors including
smoking.20,21 Studies to date have not examined specifically
how subthreshold ADHD symptoms contribute to risk for
obesity. However, a small but growing body of literature has
demonstrated that certain characteristics commonly seen
among individuals with ADHD (for example, lower levels of
attention, impulse regulation, and inhibitory control) are
more prevalent among obese children and prospectively
predict childhood obesity risk.22­28 These findings support
the notion that ADHD symptoms assessed on a dimensional
scale, not necessarily a categorical diagnosis, are relevant to
the association with obesity.
The purpose of this study was to examine associations
between ADHD symptoms, obesity and hypertension in
young adults in a large population-based cohort from the
United States. This study extends previous research on ADHD
clinical status and obesity by (1) examining the influence of
subclinical ADHD symptoms and by (2) investigating the
specific role of inattentive (IN) and hyperactive/impulsive
(HI) symptoms alone and in combination. Given that
psychosocial and psychiatric factors have also been impli-
cated as risk factors for hypertension,29,30 we also examined
the association between ADHD symptoms and hypertension.
Materials and methods
Data source and study sample
The study population consisted of 20 745 adolescents from
the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add
Health), a nationally representative study of adolescents.
This longitudinal cohort includes 12 288 respondents who
completed in-home surveys on four separate occasions (April
to December 1995; April to August 1996; August 2001 to
August 2002; and January 2008 to February 2009). The mean
age of the participants in the four waves of data collection
was 15.65 (s.d. ¼ 1.75) years, 16.22 (s.d. ¼ 1.64) years, 22.96
(s.d. ¼ 1.77) years and 28.9 (s.d. ¼ 1.76) years, respectively.
By design, the Add Health survey was stratified by region,
urban versus rural residence, school type, ethnic mix and size
to garner a nationally representative sample. The design and
data collection have been described in detail elsewhere.31,32
The study sample included participants from Wave IV who
had also completed one or more of the previous waves.
Women who were pregnant at Wave IV were excluded from
the analyses (n ¼ 433), leaving a final analysis sample of
n ¼ 11 666.
Measures
Anthropometrics. Measured height and weight were
ascertained by Add Health study personnel at Waves II, III
and IV using a digital scale and was self-reported at Wave I.
Body mass index (BMI) (kg mÀ2)33 was calculated and
categorized into three groups (normal BMI p25; overweight
BMI ¼ 25­29; and obese BMI X30). At Wave IV, waist
circumference to the nearest 0.5 cm at the superior border
of the iliac crest was also measured by study personnel using
an SECA 200 (Seca Corp., North America East; Hanover, MD,
USA) metric-increment circumference tape measure. This
measure was not collected at earlier waves.
Blood pressure and hypertension. Blood pressure (systolic
(SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP)) was measured at
Wave IV by field interviewers using a Micorolife (MicroLife
USA, Inc.; Dunedin, FL, USA) blood pleasure monitor.
Participants were instructed to remain seated for at least
5 min before the readings. Three separate readings at 30 s
intervals were conducted with participants in a seated
position with both feet on the floor and legs uncrossed.
The average of the second and third readings were used as
the SBP and DBP values unless the second and third values
were missing, in which case the first reading was used. Stage
II hypertension was defined in accordance with the 7th
report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention
Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pres-
sure: SBP X160 and DBP X100 mm Hg.34
ADHD symptoms. At Wave III, participants were asked to
retrospectively report ADHD symptoms experienced between
the ages of 5 and 12 years. Specifically, they were asked to
report the frequency of each symptom using a 4-point Likert
scale: never or rarely, sometimes, often, very often. One item
(`You were spiteful or vindictive') is not a Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) ADHD symptom and was
excluded from analyses; one DSM-IV HI symptom (`Often
interrupts or intrudes on others') was not included in the
retrospective ADHD section. Thus, our analyses included
responses to nine IN and eight HI symptoms.
A symptom was considered present if it was experienced
`often' or `very often.' This approach to dichotomizing
symptoms has been used in other community-based studies
of ADHD symptomatology, is considered clinical conven-
tion35 and was also used in previous studies on the relation
between ADHD and smoking outcomes.20,36 We examined
the dimensions of ADHD as the total number of symptoms
reported in each domain (0­9 for IN; 0­8 for HI) or as two
categorical classifications. Two categorical classifications
were also utilized: (1) To examine the incremental effect of
increasing symptoms relative to having no symptoms, we
created an ordinal variable with four categories (0 ¼ no
ADHD symptoms, obesity and hypertension

symptoms, 1 ¼ 1 symptom, 2 ¼ 2 symptoms and 3 ¼ 3 or
more symptoms); (2) to examine clinically relevant
categories based on the number of reported symptoms,
symptoms were classified into one of four clinically relevant
categories: (a) IN subtype: X6 IN symptoms, o6 HI
symptoms (n ¼ 302, 2.8%); (b) HI subtype: X6 HI symptoms,
o6 IN symptoms (n ¼ 337, 3.1%); (c) combined subtype: X6
IN symptoms and X6 HI symptoms (n ¼ 262, 2.6%); and (d)
control subtype: o6 HI and o6 IN symptoms (n ¼ 10 753,
91.5%). The six-symptom cutoff is consistent with DSM-IV
ADHD criteria requiring the presence of six or more
symptoms from either the IN or HI symptom domains, but
does not represent a proxy for the diagnosis of ADHD.
Clinical diagnoses of ADHD were not available in this
population-based sample.
The use of retrospective report is common in clinical
practice when working with adults with ADHD, and previous
studies support the reliability and validity of these self-
reports.37­41 We have previously demonstrated adequate
reliability and validity of this approach by demonstrating
good internal consistency of the items (a¼ 0.86), and we also
showed that parents of adolescents reporting six or more
symptoms on either or both HI and IN scales were more likely
to indicate learning or behavioral problems in their adolescent
children at Wave 1. These adolescents were also more likely to
report taking medications for ADHD at Wave III.36
Other variables. A number of potential covariates believed
to be related to obesity or hypertension were included in
statistical models. These variables were constructed from
Wave IV data. Physical activity was assessed by a set of three
questions regarding leisure-based activities that approxi-
mated moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (played a
strenuous team sport, played an individual sport or engaged
in the following: roller blade, roller skate, downhill ski, snow
board, racquet sports or aerobics). Participants were asked
to indicate the number of times they engaged in each
activity in the last 7 days (ranging from 0 to 7 or more times).
For analyses, scores were dichothomized (0 ¼ no moderate-
to-vigorous physical activity of the above type or
1 ¼ participation at least once in the past 7 days). Current
or past depression was a derived variable based on partici-
pants' response to whether they had ever been diagnosed
with depression and were currently (within the past 7 days)
feeling depressed. Alcohol consumption was assessed by
whether participants reported consuming alcohol in the past
30 days and, if they had drank alcohol, the number of drinks
they usually had each time. Responses were categorized as 0
(no alcohol consumption in the past 30 days), 1 (alcohol
consumption in the past 30 days; 1­4 drinks per occasion)
and 2 (alcohol consumption in the past 30 days; about 5 or
more drinks per occasion). An indicator of daily smoking
(0 not daily and 1 daily) was also included. Sociodemo-
graphic variables included age, gender and educational
attainment (high school or less, vocational or some college,
or college or greater) at Wave IV.
Statistical analysis. Associations between reported ADHD
symptoms and obesity and hypertension at Wave IV were
assessed using SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 10.0.1, SUDAAN
Statistical Software, Research Triangle Institute International,
Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) statistical software.42
SUDAAN controls for survey design effects of individuals
clustered within sampling unit (school), and stratification of
geographic region. In addition, post-stratification weights were
applied to make the results generalizable to young adults in the
United States. First, means for continuous covariates and
percentages for categorical covariates were tabulated for each
of the three BMI categories (normal, overweight and obese),
and w2-tests and t-tests were used to evaluate statistical
differences among these categories. Similar comparisons were
made between those with and without stage II hypertension.
Second, we compared the prevalences of overweight and obese
and stage II hypertension among the ADHD symptom cate-
gories. Similarly, we compared the mean waist circumference,
BMI, DBP and SBP among the ADHD symptom categories.
The adjusted associations between ADHD symptoms and
the three categories of BMI were examined using multinomial
logistic regression models. Similarly, logistic regression
models were used to assess the adjusted relationship between
ADHD symptoms and stage II hypertension. These models
examined the relative odds of overweight, obesity and
hypertension in relation to ADHD symptoms with the three
different specifications (that is, clinically consistent cate-
gories; the ordered category of 0, 1, 2 or 3 þ HI/IN symptoms;
or HI/IN on a continuous scale). To examine which symptom
domain had the stronger relationship with the outcome, a
final model included both continuous HI and IN symptoms
simultaneously. To examine the contribution of ADHD
symptoms to hypertension, both directly and as mediated
through the height-adjusted weight status, the results with
and without control for BMI at Wave IV are presented.
To explore whether ADHD symptoms were related to
naturally occurring changes in BMI during the developmen-
tal period from adolescence to adulthood, we developed a set
of latent curve models (also known as random effects,
random coefficients or mixed models outside of the
structural equation modeling framework). We initially tested
a series of unadjusted models comparing linear and quad-
ratic change functions with either user-set heteroscedastic or
homoscedastic residual errors to evaluate which model best
fit the data, in terms of w2 and other modeling fit statistics
(good model data fit is implied when root mean square error
of approximation is 0.05 or less with a 90% confidence
interval (CI) around the root mean square error of approx-
imation containing 0.05 and the Tucker Luis Index and the
Comparative Fit Index are 0.95 or greater).43,44 Factor
loadings for the linear model were fixed equal to 0, 1, 6
and 12, representing the unequal time intervals (for the
quadratic factor loadings were set to 0, 1, 36 and 144). The
parameter estimate representing the intercept reflects BMI at
mean age at Wave I, and parameter estimate representing the
slope (change) reflects growth in BMI for 1-year intervals.

The second stage involved entering the effect of the main
time invariant covariates (sex, age at Wave 1 and race) and
ADHD symptoms. This allowed for examining the effect of
ADHD symptoms on initial BMI status at Wave I (intercept),
the change in BMI over the four time points (slope) and the
change in BMI over the four time points (curve), while
controlling for race, sex and age at Wave I. Latent growth
curve modeling was conducted using Mplus version 5.2,45
which accounts for survey design effects and incorporates
sampling weights. Missing values were treated with the
inherent maximum likelihood estimation in the program.
Results
Sample characteristics by BMI categories and hypertension
status
The mean age at Wave IV was 28.9 years. Individuals in the
obese BMI category were more likely to be older, female,
black or Hispanic, have a lower educational attainment, no
physical activity in the last week, have current or past
depression, consume either larger amounts of alcohol or
abstain completely and not smoke daily (Table 1). Indivi-
duals with stage II hypertension were more likely to be older
black males, have a higher BMI, have a lower educational
attainment, no physical activity in the past week, have
current or past depression and consume either larger
amounts of alcohol or abstain completely.
ADHD symptoms by BMI categories and hypertension status
The percent obese was slightly higher among those in the
ADHD clinically relevant categories, but this was not
statistically significant (Table 2). Considering the symptom
domains separately, the proportion obese and the proportion
with hypertension were greater among those with 3 or more
HI or IN symptoms (Table 2). A slight, gradual increase in the
prevalence of obesity and stage II hypertension was present
with increasing HI and IN symptoms (Figures 1a and b).

Mean values for waist circumference, BMI, DBP and SBP
by ADHD symptoms
Mean waist circumference was higher among those in the
ADHD clinically relevant categories compared with those
with subclinical ADHD symptoms (Table 2). Mean DBP and
SBP were higher, but not statistically significantly higher
among those in the ADHD clinically relevant categories
compared with those with subclinical ADHD symptoms.
In general, means for waist circumference, BMI, DBP and SBP
increased with increasing HI and IN symptoms.
Multivariate-adjusted odds of overweight, obesity and
hypertension
Table 3 presents the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CIs from the
multinomial logistic and logistic regression analyses. Com-
pared with those in the subclinical ADHD category (o6 HI
and o6 IN symptoms), those in the HI only category had the
highest odds of obesity (OR ¼ 01.63; 95% CI ¼ 1.11­2.39).
The relative odds of hypertension among those in clinically
relevant categories (IN only, HI only or combined) were not
significantly higher than among those in the subclinical
ADHD category.
Compared with those with no HI or IN symptoms, those
with 3 or more symptoms had the highest odds of obesity
(HI 3 þ , OR ¼ 1.50, 95% CI ¼ 1.22­2.83; IN 3 þ , OR ¼ 1.21,
95% CI ¼ 1.02­1.44). In models that included the conti-
nuous variable of HI and IN (0­8 HI symptoms and 0­9 IN
symptoms), one additional HI symptom was associated
with a 5% increase in the odds of overweight and a 9%
increase in the odds of obesity (OR overweight ¼ 1.05, 95%
CI ¼ 1.01­1.09; OR obese ¼ 1.09, 95% CI ¼ 1.04­1.14).
IN symptoms, when measured on a continuous scale, were
not statistically significantly associated with overweight or
obesity (OR overweight ¼ 1.00, 95% CI ¼ 0.97­1.04; OR
obese ¼ 1.03, 95% CI ¼ 0.99­1.07) (data not shown).
In addition, HI symptoms at the 3 þ level or measured
on a continuous scale were significantly associated with
higher relative odds for hypertension (HI 3 þ , OR ¼ 1.24,
95% CI ¼ 1.01­1.51; HI continuous, OR ¼ 1.04, 95%
CI ¼ 1.00­1.09). These associations were attenuated so that
no significant associations were observed when models were
adjusted for BMI (HI 3 þ , OR ¼ 1.16, 95% CI ¼ 0.92­1.45;
HI continuous, OR ¼ 1.03, 95% CI ¼ 0.98­1.07). IN symptoms,
when measured on a continuous scale, were not statis-
tically significantly associated with hypertension, regardless
of whether BMI was included in the models (OR
hypertension ¼ 1.03, 95% CI ¼ 0.99­1.07; OR hypertension
adjusted for BMI ¼ 1.02, 95% CI ¼ 0.98­1.07) (data not
shown).
When both the HI and IN continuous symptoms were
entered together in a model, the OR was attenuated for IN
symptoms, but not for HI symptoms (OR overweight for
HI ¼ 1.08, 95% CI ¼ 1.03­1.13; OR overweight for IN ¼ 0.96,
95% CI ¼ 0.91­1.00 and OR obese for HI ¼ 1.11, 95%
CI ¼ 1.06­1.17; OR obese for IN ¼ 0.96, 95% CI ¼ 0.93­1.01)
(data not shown). There was no association between HI or IN
symptoms and hypertension when both symptoms were
entered into these models simultaneously.
Longitudinal associations between ADHD symptoms and BMI
The change in BMI was best described by a quadratic growth
function with a homoscedastic residual structure (d.f. ¼ 4;

leveling-off over time (data not shown).
Results of the longitudinal analyses assessing the influence
of ADHD symptoms on BMI growth curves, controlling for
age, sex and race can be seen in Table 4. For all models tested,
there were no significant model-fit statistic decrements
beyond the unadjusted model. In most cases, model-fit was
improved (data not shown). Models included the quadratic
function, but none of the ADHD variables were related to the
curvature, thus the data are not shown. There were no
statistically significant associations between the clinically
relevant ADHD categories and overall BMI intercept or slope.
HI symptoms assessed as either a categorical variable or on a
continuous scale were associated with BMI intercept and
slope. Compared with having no HI symptoms, having 3 þ
HI symptoms was associated with a 0.36 unit higher initial
BMI above the age/sex/race-adjusted mean intercept of 22.32
(that is, 22.68). From Wave I to Wave IV, the slope in BMI
among those with 3 þ HI symptoms was 0.12 units higher
compared with those with no HI symptoms (0.85 vs the
age/sex/race-adjusted mean slope of 0.73). A similar effect
was observed for the continuous 0 to 8 HI variable with
higher HI symptoms associated with a higher initial BMI and
steeper slope over time (gintercept
¼ 0.08, s.e. ¼ 0.04, Po0.05;
gslope
¼ 0.02, s.e. ¼ 0.01, Po0.05) (data not shown).
Compared with the effect of the HI symptoms, IN
symptoms had a slightly different effect on the BMI intercept
and slope. IN symptoms were significantly associated with
the intercept, but not the slope. Compared with having no
IN symptoms, having 3 þ IN symptoms was associated with
a significantly higher mean BMI intercept of about half a
unit (aintercept IN 3 þ
¼ 22.73 vs aintercept IN 0
¼ 22.29, Po0.01).
Increasing IN symptoms (either assessed with the four-
categorical indicator or on the continuous 0 to 9 scale) were
not associated with increasing slope in BMI over time
(P-valuesX0.05). A graphic depiction of the effect of four
category HI and IN symptoms on BMI intercept and slope
can be viewed in Figures 2a and b.
When both IN and HI were entered in the model together,
increasing IN symptoms were significantly associated with
initial BMI intercept, but not slope (gintercept
¼ 0.08,
s.e. ¼ 0.04, Po0.05 and gslope ¼
0.00, s.e. ¼ 0.01, P ¼ 0.84,
respectively) (data not shown). Conversely, increasing HI
symptoms was not statistically associated with initial BMI
intercept, but was with increasing slope in BMI
(gintercept
¼ 0.02, s.e. ¼ 0.05, P ¼ 0.60 and gslope
¼ 0.02,
s.e. ¼ 0.01, Po0.05, respectively) (data not shown).

adolescence into early adulthood. HI symptoms were also
related to risk of hypertension during adulthood, but
accounting for BMI during adulthood in the analyses
attenuated this association, indicating that adult BMI is a
stronger predictor of hypertension than are HI symptoms.
The present findings are consistent with previous reports
linking clinically diagnosed ADHD with higher prevalence of
obesity.12­15 To our knowledge, only one other population-
based study has found that a diagnosis of ADHD persisting
into adulthood is associated with a higher risk for obesity.19
However, the database used for that study included only a
history of ADHD diagnosis, not specific ADHD symptoms,
and only had categorical self-reported indicators of weight
rather than measured height and weight and BMI measured
in a continuous manner. Thus, this is the first population-
based study to examine the association between ADHD
symptoms, both the IN and HI dimensions, as predictors of
adult BMI, changes in BMI over time and risk of adult obesity
and hypertension.
Studies in clinical or local samples are often the first
reports of new associations. However, the degree to which
these findings generalize to the larger population remains
unknown. Larger population-based studies of non-clinical
samples, such as this one, are important for extending these
initial reports, as well as for identifying the degree to which
individual differences, as reflected by IN and HI symptoms,
may have on the development of obesity and related health
outcomes. Furthermore, examining the different domains of
HI and IN dimensionally is important because this better
accounts for the variability among people with these symp-
toms. Also, there may be partially dissociable genetic and
phenotypic pathways that give rise to HI and IN symptom
domains.46 As such, identifying associations separately for
each symptom domain can generate hypotheses about possible
pathways to non-homeostatic eating and risk for obesity.
In general, our findings highlight that HI and IN ADHD
symptom domains have differential effects on risk for obesity
as they relate to naturally occurring changes in BMI from
adolescence to adulthood. IN symptoms, which are related
to deficits in ability to sustain attention and/or exert
persistent effort, were related to higher BMI during adoles-
cence, but did not have an impact on the changes in BMI
over time; whereas HI symptoms, which are related to
deficits in behavioral inhibitory control, did not affect BMI
during adolescence but were associated with increasing BMI
over time. Although further work is needed to more precisely
characterize the nature of the relationship between ADHD
symptoms and obesity, our findings highlight that both
symptom domains affect risk for obesity, but have more or
less impact during different developmental periods.
The behavioral mechanisms that underlie ADHD symp-
tom­obesity outcomes are yet to be fully elucidated.
Laboratory studies have shown that habituation to food
cues is disrupted during activities when attention allocation
is required (for example, television viewing), resulting in
increased energy consumption47 with highly IN individuals
tending to consume more energy during television
viewing.48 As such, children with deficits in ability to sustain
attention may be less likely to habituate to food cues and
consume more calories when engaged by distracting stimuli,
such as watching television or playing video games. Later,
during adolescence, when parental regulation and control
over food choices wanes, individuals with inability to
inhibit behavioral responses may be disadvantaged when
attempting to regulate their own food choices.
The link between ADHD symptoms and obesity is
biologically plausible. Several investigators have hypo-
thesized that ADHD and non-homeostatic eating leading
to obesity may share common underlying neurological
substrates, especially those related to the production and
reuptake of the neurotransmitter dopamine.7,49 Genetic
association studies have found that ADHD and obesity are
both associated with genes regulating dopamine avail-
ability.50 Furthermore, in two separate studies using Positron
emission tomography with [11C]raclopride, Volkow et al.52
have shown that individuals with ADHD50 and those who
are obese both show lower than normal dopamine (D2)
receptor availability. This lower dopamine receptor avail-
ability could reflect the common dispositions in both ADHD
and obesity.22­27,53­56
In the present analysis, HI symptoms were associated with
an increased risk of hypertension. However, this association
was reduced after adjusting for current BMI. Studies of
psychosocial risk factors for hypertension have found that
trait impulsivity, hostility and time urgency/impatience are
related to greater risk for hypertension.30,57 These traits may
be overrepresented among those with high levels of HI
symptoms.58 Further study is warranted investigating the
degree to which HI symptoms relate to cardiovascular
pathology, as well as the mechanisms that may underlie
these potential associations. At this point, we can only
conclude that the ADHD­hypertension association may be
best explained by differences in health behaviors, such
as healthy dietary intake and physical activity, which may
be easier to sustain with decreasing ADHD symptoms.
Strengths and limitations
In this large population-based sample, clinical assessments
were not undertaken. Thus, we are not able to determine
the association between a clinical diagnosis of ADHD and
obesity and/or hypertension. Furthermore, the database only
includes ADHD symptoms as recalled from the past. The
approach to quantifying ADHD symptoms by retrospective
self-report has been shown to be reliable and valid;35,36
however, prospective designs should be used to replicate our
findings. Our constructed measure of `clinically relevant'
symptoms should not be construed as clinical diagnostic
categories, but rather an approximation of ADHD subtypes.
The strength of the association that we found between `HI
only' and adult obesity (OR ¼ 1.6) is similar to those reported
by others who have examined the association between
ADHD symptoms, obesity and hypertension
BF Fuemmeler et al
859
International Journal of Obesity
diagnostic classification of ADHD and adult obesity
(OR ¼ 1.8).19 Thus, it may be that the association reported
between our `clinically relevant' categories and risk for
obesity and hypertension is an underestimate of the
relationship between clinical ADHD and obesity and hyper-
tension. Nevertheless, the purpose of this study was not only
to examine the association between clinical levels of ADHD
and obesity, but also to estimate the relationships between
dimensional levels of symptoms and risk for obesity and
hypertension for the reasons stated above. The findings
highlight that there may be variability unaccounted for by
sole use of clinical categories that is important in the relation
between ADHD symptoms and obesity, and this deserves
further investigation. A strength of the study is that we were
able to examine how ADHD symptoms related to naturally
occurring changes in BMI over the course of adolescence into
adulthood, something which has not heretofore been
investigated. In future studies, however, it will be important
to confirm these findings with prospectively collected data
on ADHD symptoms or ADHD phenotypes (for example,
behavioral inhibition), preferably combined with clinical
diagnosis of ADHD. The lack of data on multiple measures of
blood pressure or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
prevented us from determining the association that ADHD
symptoms had on changes in hypertension susceptibility
over time. Finally, although we did include a number of
covariates that were related to risk for obesity and hyperten-
sion, many of these were based on self-report. There is the
possibility of potential residual confounding of both mea-
sured and unmeasured variables.
Conclusions
Evidence from smaller community-based samples and at
least one other population-based representative sample have
found an association between ADHD and adult obesity. Our
findings show a dose­response increase in risk of obesity
associated with increasing ADHD symptoms, especially HI
symptoms. Indicators of hypertension also increased with
increasing HI symptoms; however, this relationship was
attenuated when accounting for BMI. If our findings are
confirmed in other samples, they could have relevant
clinical implications both for the treatment of ADHD and
for obesity. As has been suggested, it may be clinically
relevant to screen patients with ADHD who are at risk for
obesity to develop appropriate treatment strategies.7,59,60
Medications for ADHD often suppress appetite, and in
children decelerated growth velocity has typically been a
concern. It may become necessary for clinicians to monitor
weight more carefully among their child and adolescent
patients with ADHD, especially when they come off
medications or in developmental transitions where weight
gain is common. Treatment for obesity may also be affected
among individuals with ADHD symptoms. Treatment
effectiveness may be diminished and relapse may be greater
among those with more ADHD symptoms.27 Given the
mounting evidence, effort directed at developing and
defining strategies for assessing and treating obese patients
with co-occurring ADHD symptoms and for monitoring
ADHD patients for unhealthy weight gain appears
warranted.
There has been increasing interest in the response
inhibition hypothesis of obesity and ADHD.23,61­65 Our
findings reflecting significant associations between HI
symptoms and risk for obesity synchronize with this line of
study. Examining the associations between ADHD symptoms
or ADHD symptom-like phenotypes on obesity outcomes
could be a fruitful venue of research on both the etiology of
obesity and as a means for improving tailored treatment and
prevention strategies.
