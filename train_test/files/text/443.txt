Background: Our objective was to analyse the influence of education on the link between functional limitation (FL) and self-rated health
(SRH) in two countries, France and the USA. Methods: The data of the North American NHANES study (n = 9254) and the French National
Health Survey (n = 25 559) were used. FL was measured by the ADL and IADL scales. We constructed a logistic regression model with SRH as
the outcome and included variables for education, FL and the interaction between education and FL. All results were adjusted for age.
Results: Poor SRH was more frequently reported in France than in the USA (24.1% vs. 18.4% for men, 29.0% vs. 19.7% for women). The most
highly educated persons in the USA had similar FL (25.4% for men, 32.9% for women) to the least educated French persons (22.8% for men,
31.8% for women). In the USA, FL was associated more strongly with poor SRH in the most educated men than in the least educated. In
France, the same interaction was observed although the link was weaker than in the USA. FL was more strongly associated with poor SRH in
the most educated women than in the least educated in both countries. Conclusion: Functional limitation had a greater impact on the most
highly educated persons in both France and the USA. Using SRH as a measure of health for evaluating social inequalities could lead to
underestimation of the true magnitude of functional health inequalities existing within and between countries.

Introduction
Since the original study by Mossey and Shapiro in 19821, many studies
have shown that self-rated health (SRH), based on a single item asking
how people rate their health, is associated with mortality even after
adjusting for a variety of factors.2,3 SRH is thus an attractive measure
of health because it is easy to use, refers to a multi-dimensional definition
of health and is a good predictor of mortality. Therefore, some studies
aimed at analysing health inequalities have used this indicator as a
measure of health. However, recent results have shown that the
predictive value of SRH on subsequent mortality differs according to
level of educational attainment.4­6 Other studies have reported that edu-
cational attainment directly influences the relationship between objective
health status and SRH, with objectively measured chronic conditions
having less of an impact on SRH among the least educated group.7,8
One possible explanation for this phenomenon is differences in the
expectations and aspirations people may have regarding their health
according to educational attainment. In this case, the impact of a same
health condition on SRH could be higher for those who have the highest
expectations, such as socially advantaged groups or those with a high level
of education.9 The fact that for a same health condition people with a
high socio-economic position may experience a greater negative impact
on their perceived health than people with lower socio-economic position
could lead to an underestimation of health inequalities between
socio-economic groups when using SRH as an indicator of health.
If we consider that this phenomenon is true, in the aim of using SRH as
a measure of health for analysing social inequalities across countries, a
logical question is to ask if the influence of socio-economic position on
the relationship between health status and SRH is stable and the same in
different social and cultural contexts. Studies have shown that the
proportion of poor SRH varies across countries.10,11 Such cross-country
comparisons may be most useful. However, they need to be made with
caution, since many factors have been suggested to influence SRH:
population structure in terms of individual characteristics (social
position, lifestyle, health status), differences in social capital,12,13
culture, health-care systems14 and/or linguistic factors.14 When
comparing social inequalities in health across countries using SRH,
another pitfall may arise if the influence of socio-economic position on
the relationship between health status and SRH also differs from country
to country. Little attention has been given to this possibility, although it
could shed light on the results from international comparative studies.
Exploring the possibility that socio-economic position has an influence
Functional limitations and SRH between France and USA 317
on the link between health conditions and SRH is thus of main interest
and constitutes the purpose of this study.
As an example of an overall measure of health, functional limitation
(FL), defined here as an individual's report of limitations or an inability
to conduct basic daily activities due to health problems, has been shown
to lead to poorer SRH.15­17 It has been suggested that the relationship
between functional health and SRH may differ according to social
status.8,18 FL could, therefore, be used as a relevant measure of health
condition to study the role of socio-economic position on the relation-
ship between health status and SRH. If socio-economic position has a
different impact on this relationship in different countries, then
intercultural comparisons using SRH as a marker of functional status
would be meaningless, or would require stratification according to
social status. We, therefore, aimed to compare the influence of educa-
tional attainment on the link between FL and SRH in two countries,
France and the USA.
Methods
Two sets of data were used for the current study. The first set of data,
NHANES, is a representative sample of the US population. The second
set, the National Health Survey (NHS) (http://www.insee.
fr/fr/methodes/default.asp?page=sources/ope-enq-sante.htm) is a repre-
sentative sample of the French population.
French sample
The French data were those of the NHS, the only source of systematic
statistical data about the health, health-care consumption
and socio-economic characteristics of French households. This study
has been described in detail elsewhere.19 Briefly, data were collected
through a multilevel, stratified, random survey of households that, on
the basis of data from the 1999 national population census, are represen-
tative of the French population. People who live in institutions (e.g.
retirement homes, religious communities, prisons and hospitals), in
mobile homes or who are homeless are not included, therefore $98%
of the entire population is covered by the survey.19 Using a combination
of face-to-face interviews and self-administered questionnaires, the NHS
collects data at both individual and household levels, including informa-
tion about demographic characteristics, socio-economic and health
status, complementary insurance coverage and medical care
consumption.
A new data collection was carried out between October 2002
and September 2003 and constitutes our sample. People were interviewed
in five waves, throughout the year to account for seasonal variability.
Three face-to-face interviews were conducted at 1-month intervals. The
overall response rate during the 2003 NHS survey was >85%. The global
sample was composed of 16 821 households, representing 40 796 individ-
uals. We restricted our analyses to participants who completed
self-administered questionnaires on their health. We excluded partici-
pants younger than 18 years (n = 9800), pregnant women (n = 269).
The final sample consisted of 12 110 men and 13 718 women.
US sample
The US data came from the 2001­02 to 2003­04 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), described in detail
elsewhere.20 In brief, NHANES is a cross-sectional, nationally
representative survey of the civilian non-institutionalized population of
the USA. The NHANES uses a stratified, multistage, probability sample.
This multi-stage sample is based on a selection of counties, blocks,
households and persons within households. Data are collected through
an in-person home interview and a physical examination, conducted by
physicians, at mobile examination centres.
Of the 25 917 persons selected in the study, 21 161 (81.6%) persons
completed the in-person home interview and 20 120 (77.6%) subsequent-
ly completed a physical interview/examination. We restricted our analyses
to respondents who completed both the home interview and the physical
interview/examination. We excluded participants aged <20 years
(n = 10 351) and pregnant women (n = 515). The final sample consisted
of 4661 men and 4593 women.
Self-rated health
In the French sample, SRH was measured using the WHO definition, by
asking participants to rate their health as very good, good, fair, poor or
very poor. The responses were dichotomized in our analyses: individuals
reporting very good or good health were classified as having good SRH
and those reporting fair or poor or very poor health as having poor SRH.
In the US sample, SRH was measured using the US definition, by asking
participants to rate their health as excellent, very good, good, fair or poor.
Those reporting excellent, very good or good health were classified as
having good SRH and those reporting fair or poor health as having poor
SRH. It has been shown that associations of SRH with socio-economic
status were similar for the two self-rated item versions, and that com-
parisons of how these factors relate to SRH across surveys using a
different 5-point self-rated scale were unlikely to be biased.21
Socio-economic position
To assess socio-economic position in the two studies, we used level of
education categorized according to the number of years of education:
<12, 12 and >12 years.
Health status
We assessed the relation between SRH and FL, which was defined in the
same way in both studies. FL was assessed using the scale of activities of
daily living (ADLs),22 instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs),
mobility and upper/lower body strength and social participation.23
Participants who reported some difficulty, much difficulty or who were
unable to do one of the activities were considered as having FL.
Statistical analysis
Education may affect SRH and the relationship between FL and SRH
differently according to gender,24­26 so all our analyses were conducted
separately for men and for women. Age-adjusted prevalence of poor
health and FL were compared between France and the USA. To test if
educational level modifies the relationship between FL and SRH, we con-
structed a logistic regression model with SRH as the outcome and
included variables for education, FL and the interaction between
education and FL in the model. We then compared results observed in
France and in the USA. As educational level can be influenced by age, all
these analyses were adjusted for age both in the USA and the French
samples.
Sampling weights were used to account for the sampling structure and
to correct for systematic non-response bias for both samples. This
procedure allows data to be weighted in an inversely proportional rela-
tionship to the non-response probabilities of individuals, in order to
represent the true population.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Educational level
Among US men, 54.4% had >12 years of education compared with 28.0%
of French men (P < 0.0001). Among US women, 55.1% had >12 years of
education, compared with 25.5% of French women (P < 0.0001). The
distribution by age according to educational level differed between the
two countries (table 1). Among US men aged over 60 years, 48.8% had
>12 years of education, compared with 13.5% of their French counter-
parts. Among US women, 39.1% had >12 years of education compared
with 7.9% of their French counterparts.

Self-rated health
After adjustment for age, the proportion of people reporting poor SRH
was higher in France than in the USA, for both men (24.1% in France vs.
18.4% in the USA, P < 0.0001) and women (28.8 vs. 19.7%, P < 0.0001).
Lower educational level was associated with poorer SRH in both
countries, regardless of gender (table 2). The gradient according to edu-
cational level was steeper in the USA than in France. The proportion of
people reporting poor health was similar in France and the USA among
the lowest educated group, for both men and women, whereas the
difference was significant for people with 12 years of education or more.
Functional limitation
French men with a lower level of education were more likely to report FL
than those with the highest level. This was also the case for US men, those
with a lower level of education being more likely to report FL than those
with the highest level. Among the women of both countries, those with a
lower level of education were more likely to report FL than those with a
higher level.
The proportion of people reporting FL was higher in the USA than in
France (table 2), whatever the gender and the level of education.
Differences between countries were so big that the most highly
educated persons in the USA had a similar proportion of FL (25.4%
for men, 32.9% for women) as the least educated French persons
(22.8% for men, 31.8% for women).
Interaction between educational level and FL in relation
to SRH
Tables 2 and 3 show the relationship between FL and poor SRH stratified
by educational level for men and women. For men, FL was associated
with SRH at every educational level in both countries. In the USA, the
proportion of men reporting poor SRH in the presence of FL increased to
a relatively greater extent for those with >12 years of education than for
those with <12 years of education (interaction test P = 0.02). After
adjusting for age, FL was associated more strongly with poor SRH in
more highly educated men than in those with lower educational
attainment (OR = 7.62, 95% CI 5.02­11.58 for the most educated vs.
OR = 4.23, 95% CI 2.80­6.38 for the least educated). The situation was
slightly different in France, where FL did not have a greater impact on
participants with >12 years of education than on those with <12 years
(interaction test P = 0.09). After adjusting for age, the odds ratio for poor
SRH in presence of FL was 6.15 (95% CI 4.40­8.59) for the most
educated men compared with 5.21 (95% CI 4.26­6.39) for the least
educated.
In women, the proportion with poor SRH in the presence of
FL increased more for women with >12 years of education than for

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that directly compares
the moderating role of education on the relationship between FL and
SRH in two different countries. As shown in a previous study,8 our
results confirm that the impact of certain self-reported physical health
conditions, such as FL, on SRH is different according to level of
education. But our results suggest, for the first time, that this effect
may be observed across countries, at least in France and in the USA. In
both countries, FL has relatively greater repercussions on SRH in people
with a higher education level. They may have higher expectations
regarding health, and so in the event of disease the impact on SRH
may be greater. This explanation is supported by other findings
showing the influence of education on the relationship between SRH
and morbidity7 and between SRH and mortality.4­6 It is noteworthy
that the gradient seems similar in France and in the USA, with the
most highly educated Americans reporting comparable rates of FL to
those of the least educated French people.
An important limitation of our study is that health conditions were
self-reported, so may be influenced in the same way as SRH and be
susceptible to misreporting.27 However, information on health
conditions is a subjective report of factual matters.11 As showed by
Haapanen et al.,28 the agreement between questionnaire data and
medical records may be good for chronic diseases that have a clear
definition. Therefore, the results are unlikely to be biased with regard
to FL, which is measured and defined in the same way in the French and
the US samples. Moreover, in a previous study using NHANES data,7 we
showed that education influenced the relationship between health
conditions (measured using clinical variables) and SRH, reinforcing the
results that we found using variables based on self-reported information.8
Banks et al.29 also showed that a socio-economic status gradient appears
whether self-reports or biological measures of health are used.
The French NHS and NHANES were not designed to enable interna-
tional comparisons. However, the US and French samples are very similar
in their construction and are representative of the general population,
reinforcing the validity of this comparison. Health conditions are not
measured in the same way in the French and the US samples, with the
exception of FL, which is why it was selected for the comparison between
the two countries.
The measure of SRH was different in the two countries and could
partly explain the lower proportion of poor health observed in the
USA compared with France: the US definition (excellent, very good,
good, fair and poor) vs. the WHO definition (very good, good, fair,
bad and very bad) used in France. Jurges et al.21 showed that people
seem to be in better health using the US definition, and that the WHO
variable could lead to a higher prevalence of poor SRH.30 However, Jurges
et al.21 have shown that `associations of SRH with demographic factors
such as socio-economic status were similar for the two self-rated item
versions. Thus comparisons of how demographic and other factors relate
to SRH across surveys using a different 5-point self-rated scale are unlikely
to be biased'. Thus, using two differing definitions for SRH may not limit
our analysis of the impact of education on the link between health
conditions and SRH in France and the USA.
The way SRH is translated could also influence the proportion of
people reporting poor health. Bzostek et al.31 showed that translation
issues between Spanish and English language versions of the SRH
question may give rise to some of the differences between Hispanic and
non-Hispanic US respondents. This may also be relevant for differences
observed between French and English language versions, particularly
regarding the use of the word `fair', which is translated by `moyen' in
French, a word that could connote a more negative meaning than `fair'
does in English.
The proportion of people reporting FL increased as level of education
decreased in both countries. This gradient was similar in France and the
USA, suggesting that strong social health inequalities exist for FL in both
countries. However, the most highly educated Americans reported similar
FL rates to French people with the lowest education level. Banks et al.29
have also shown that Americans with the highest levels of education have
comparable rates of diabetes and heart disease to those in the bottom
educational stratum in England. Reasons for health differences between
countries are complex, and are likely to be affected by differences between
health systems and access to care. Health insurance coverage is not
universal in the USA and is much more dependent on socio-economic
resources than in France. Some Americans have no health insurance, even
among people with the highest level of education. However, the
proportion of those with no health insurance in the top income tertile
is low,29 suggesting that access to care is not likely to be the main ex-
planation for health differences between the USA and France. Differences
between France and the USA in the prevalence of risk factors such as
obesity or income inequality as well as differences in social capital32 may
also be relevant in explaining this phenomenon. However, Banks et al.29
showed that differences in the distribution of risk factors were not the
main explanation for the poorer health of Americans compared with the
equivalent English population. Why highly educated Americans present
rates of disease comparable to poorly educated people living in countries
like France or England is worthy of future investigation.

It is noteworthy that though they reported more FL than French
people, Americans with at least 12 years of education were less likely to
report poor SRH than their French counterparts. As we said before, US
and French categories for SRH were different and could partly explain
this paradox. However, regardless of the indicator used, cultural differ-
ences in the understanding and meaning of health could also play a role.
The reference point or normative category in the scale may be different in
different cultural environments.10 As Idler and Benyamini suggest,2 the
response scale measuring SRH may be used differently depending on
cultural and linguistic conventions in describing normal health. This is
in accordance with Jurges11 who showed that the French tend to under-
estimate their health, as do the Germans. Desesquelles et al.30 also showed
that French people with IADLs rated their health as being worse than
Italians in the same situation, highlighting the influence of cultural en-
vironments on perceptions of health status.
Our results show that the relationship between health conditions and
SRH is modified by educational level and that this phenomenon exists in
both France and the USA. The impact of FL on SRH was greater for the
highest educational level compared with the lowest, in France and in the
USA. Therefore the use of SRH as a measure of health for evaluating
social inequalities could lead to underestimation of the real magnitude of
health inequalities existing within and between countries. Future studies
using social indicators other than education are needed, as are interna-
tional studies evaluating how people from different cultures understand
and evaluate the notion of health, how they understand SRH and select
their specific health category. These are important considerations that
need to be taken into account in attempting to understand health differ-
ences between socio-economic groups or populations.

Key points
 Educational attainment is reported to directly influence the rela-
tionship between health status and SRH.
 The influence of education may differ from country to country,
and could shed light on the results from international compara-
tive studies using SRH as a health indicator.
 FL had a greater impact on SRH for highly educated than for low
educated persons, in both France and the USA.
 Use of SRH as a measure of health could underestimate the true
magnitude of health inequalities existing within and between
countries.
