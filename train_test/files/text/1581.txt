Abstract
Background: Firearms are the most commonly used weapon to commit homicide in the U.S.
Virtually all firearms enter the public marketplace through a federal firearms licensee (FFL): a store
or individual licensed by the federal government to sell firearms. Whether FFLs contribute to gun-
related homicide in areas where they are located, in which case FFLs may be a homicide risk factor
that can be modified, is not known.
Methods: Annual county-level data (1993­1999) on gun homicide rates and rates of FFLs per
capita were analyzed using negative binomial regression controlling for socio-demographic
characteristics. Models were run to evaluate whether the relation between rates of FFLs and rates
of gun homicide varied over the study period and across counties according to their level of
urbanism (defined by four groupings, as below). Also, rates of FFLs were compared against FS/S ­
which is the proportion of suicides committed by firearm and is thought to be a good proxy for
firearm availability in a region ­ to help evaluate how well the FFL variable is serving as a way to
proxy firearm availability in each of the county types of interest.
Results: In major cities, gun homicide rates were higher where FFLs were more prevalent (rate
ratio [RR] = 1.70, 95% CI 1.03­2.81). This association increased (p < 0.01) from 1993 (RR = 1.69)
to 1999 (RR = 12.72), due likely to federal reforms that eliminated low-volume dealers, making FFL
prevalence a more accurate exposure measure over time. No association was found in small towns.
In other cities and in suburbs, gun homicide rates were significantly lower where FFLs were more
prevalent, with associations that did not change over the years of the study period. FFL prevalence
was correlated strongly (positively) with FS/S in major cities only, suggesting that the findings for
how FFL prevalence relates to gun homicide may be valid for the findings pertaining to major cities
but not to counties of other types.
Conclusion: Modification of FFLs through federal, state, and local regulation may be a feasible
intervention to reduce gun homicide in major cities.

Background
Homicide is a major cause of death in the U.S. and the sec-
ond leading cause of death among 15­34 year-olds.[1]
During each year of the past quarter century (1980­
2005), more homicides were committed with firearms
than with all other weapon types combined.[2] Firearms
accounted for 331,270 homicides over this period.[2]
A correspondingly large firearm manufacturing and dealer
distribution system exists in the U.S. and is thought to
contribute to the incidence of firearm homicide. [3-5] The
number of federally-licensed firearm dealers (FFLs),
which include gun stores and individuals that are licensed
by the federal government to ship, transport, and receive
firearms in interstate commerce and engage in retail sales,
may play a major role. There were 104,840 FFLs in the
U.S. in 2001.[6] No publicly available data report the
number of guns sold by FFLs. However, data on gun pur-
chases and on guns seized and guns recovered by police
indicate that firearms flow through FFLs into U.S. com-
munities at a rate that sums into the millions each year.
[7-9] A state-level study, using self-reports of household
firearm ownership as a proxy for gun availability, found
that the states where guns were most common experi-
enced the highest rates of gun homicide.[10] Similarly, it
is possible that a greater number of FFLs is associated with
greater gun availability and ultimately, increased gun
homicide rates.
Although the federal government is responsible for regu-
lating which individuals or businesses are issued an FFL,
the decision about where an FFL can operate is a local
matter. Therefore, it is helpful to adopt an urban planning
perspective when considering the possibility that FFLs
could be impacting local homicide rates.[11,12] Like
other businesses, FFLs are subject to regulations including
zoning laws which dictate how land parcels can be used.
In addition to zoning laws, state-level legislation,
although currently in place in only a minority of states,
can mandate additional licensing requirements and peri-
odic inspection of gun dealer records.[13] Therefore, if
FFLs do act as a spigot through which firearms flow into a
community and thereby contribute to homicide, it is pos-
sible that regulating the locations and activities of stores
where firearms are sold is a way to curb homicide. With
this in mind, we considered whether licensed gun dealers
function as a proxy for gun availability in counties in the
U.S., and studied whether having a disproportionately
high number of FFLs in a county was associated an ele-
vated rate of homicide committed with guns. Other stud-
ies examining mortality as a function of gun availability
have used FS/S ­ the proportion of suicides that were
committed with firearms as opposed to other methods ­
as a way to measure by proxy the extent of gun availability
in a geographic area. Whereas FS/S appears to serve well as
a proxy for gun availability, FS/S is not a risk factor that is
modifiable.[10,14,15] FFLs are modifiable, in contrast, in
terms of their locations and retail practices, and thus in
this way this analysis is investigating a public health issue
with direct policy relevance.
Methods
Data and Variables
Our dataset consisted of seven separate, year-specific
entries for 3,112 counties (including the District of
Columbia and county equivalents such as boroughs and
independent cities), totaling 21,784 observations of
county-level data for the U.S. from 1993 to 1999. The out-
come measure was annual firearm homicide rates per
100,000 population in U.S. counties for the years 1993
through 1999. The rates were calculated with firearm
homicide data from the National Center for Health Statis-
tics' (NCHS) Multiple Cause of Death files (defined as
International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision
[ICD-9] codes E965.0­E965.4 for 1993­1998 and ICD-10
codes X93­X95 for 1999) and population data from U.S.
Census data. Permission to include counties with fewer
than 100,000 persons was obtained from the NCHS Divi-
sion of Vital Statistics. We calculated this outcome meas-
ure separately by year for each U.S. county. Our primary
predictor measure was the annual per capita prevalence of
"type one" (firearm dealer) and "type two" (pawnbroker)
FFLs (per 1,000 population) in counties for the years 1993
through 1999. The FFL data were obtained from Basic
Information Systems, Inc. (Wheaton, Maryland), which
provided data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Fire-
arms and Explosives (ATF) on the annual number and
type of FFLs in the U.S. by county for the study period. FFL
data were not available for counties in Alaska and there-
fore Alaska was not included in the analysis. FFL data for
years after 1999 were not available.
Covariates were used to control for several county-level
factors thought to be potential confounders of the associ-
ation between FFL rates and homicide rates being studied
(e.g., [10]): percent of population 15­29 years old, per-
cent male, percent African American, percent Native
American, percent Hispanic, percent married, percent liv-
ing alone, percent female headed households, average per
capita income, percent of persons below the poverty level,
percent of the civilian labor force unemployed, percent
over age 25 who were college educated, hospital beds per
capita, and percent of arrests that were drug-related. Each
of these variables was obtained from the U.S. Census
Bureau and the Area Resource File[16] with the exception
of drug-related arrests, which was obtained from the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation's county-level Uniform Crime
Reports (UCR),[17] and was incorporated given evidence
that drug arrests may be feasible as an indicator of drug
activity.[18,19] Because the UCR arrest data are derived
BMC Public Health 2009, 9:199 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/9/199

from police jurisdictions, which do not correspond
exactly with county boundaries, a second variable that
adjusted for the discrepancy by distance-based weighting
between police jurisdiction centriods and county centro-
ids was included in the model. Also, the covariates
included a variable for urbanization defined according to
a modification of the rural-urban continuum classifica-
tion (mRUC) scheme [20-22] designed by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.[23] This variable initially
included 11 categories that were collapsed to four catego-
ries for parsimony during preliminary analyses: major cit-
ies (mRUC 1: central counties of one million population
or more); other cities (mRUC 2: central counties of metro-
politan areas of one million population or more); sub-
urbs (mRUC 3­5: fringe counties of metropolitan areas of
one million population or more, ranging to counties in
metropolitan areas of fewer than 250,000 population);
and small towns (mRUC 6­11: urban counties with a
population of 20,000 or more adjacent to a metropolitan
area, ranging to completely rural counties of less than
2,500 urban population not adjacent to a metro area).
Each variable was measured annually except for urbaniza-
tion, persons below the poverty level, female-headed
households, persons living alone, persons married, and
persons college-educated. These variables were based on
data available either decennially and/or for certain inter-
censal years. Intercensal years without data were linearly
interpolated or forecast based on known values. Addition-
ally, a linear trend for year was included to account for
temporal variability.
Given that the availability of firearms in one county may
depend on how many FFLs exist in surrounding counties,
a variable was included to reflect the prevalence of FFLs in
counties surrounding the index county, weighted by the
inverse of the squared rectilinear distance between county
population-weighted centriods. The leniency of state fire-
arm laws in each county was controlled for as well. This
was done by coding each county according to a classifica-
tion scheme published annually since 1997. [24-29] The
scheme uses an integer scale ranging from 0 to 100, with
0 representing maximum restrictiveness and 100 repre-
senting maximum leniency, to reflect state laws pertaining
to the acquisition, ownership, and transportation of fire-
arms and ammunition. Leniency scores were assigned sep-
arately to each county for each year. The leniency scores
used for 1997 through 1999 were taken directly from pub-
lished information. We linearly extrapolated leniency
scores for the years 1993 through 1996 based on the val-
ues published for the period 1997 through 2002. Finally,
a variable containing county-level annual nongun homi-
cide rates (defined as ICD-9 codes E960­E964 and
E965.5­E967.9 for 1993­1998 and ICD-10 codes X85­
X92 and X96­Y08 for 1999) was derived for inclusion in
the final statistical model. This was done to explore the
possibility that such an adjustment could help control for
a latent homicidal tendency at the county level and isolate
the contribution of FFLs to gun homicide.
Statistical Analysis
Plots were generated to assess annual prevalence rates of
FFLs and rates of homicide in the U.S. Negative binomial
generalized linear regression conducted at the county
level was used to estimate the association between the
prevalence of FFLs and rates of gun homicide in U.S.
counties during the 1993­1999 study period. Model coef-
ficients were converted into incidence rate ratios (RR),
and the result of the final statistical model are presented.
Correlation stemming from use of multiple data years was
accounted for with generalized estimating equations
under a working independence correlation matrix. Spear-
man correlation coefficients and variance inflation factors
were used to identify multicollinearity and for diagnostic
purposes. Also, variation by year and urbanization, for
reasons discussed below, was then investigated by restrict-
ing analyses to individual data years and using interaction
terms to permit the relation between the prevalence of
FFLs and rates of gun homicide to vary across counties
according to their size (i.e., on the rural-urban contin-
uum). The variable used to represent a linear trend for
year was excluded from the year-specific models. The
adjusted RR estimates derived from these models are pre-
sented in a summary table.
To gain insight into how well the FFL prevalence variable
may be serving as a way to proxy gun availability in coun-
ties of each grouping, the proportion of suicides commit-
ted with firearms (FS/S) ­ which is considered an accurate
proxy for household gun availability and has been studied
in state-level and region-level analyses [10,14,15] ­ was
computed within each county by year and modeled in
place of our FFL variable. Spearman correlation coeffi-
cients were also calculated to determine how well FS/S
was correlated with the FFL prevalence rate within coun-
ties of each grouping.
Results
In 1993, 17,984 gun homicides and 6,141 nongun homi-
cides occurred in the U.S. At that time a total of 253,314
gun manufacturers, gun stores and individuals held active
licenses to sell firearms (i.e., FFLs). The annual incidence
rates of gun and nongun homicide and the annual preva-
lence rates of FFLs in the U.S. from 1993 to 1999 are
shown in Figure 1. Rates of gun homicide dropped con-
siderably over this period, ranging from 3.98 per 100,000
in 1993 to 2.55 per 100,000 in 1999. By contrast, rates of
nongun homicide fluctuated little, ranging from a high in
1993 of 1.52 per 100,000 to a low in 1999 of 1.11 per
100,000. The prevalence of FFLs decreased even more dra-
matically than did gun homicide, ranging from 1.99 per

1,000 in 1993 to 0.70 per 1,000 in 1999. The average
amount by which gun homicide rates and FFL prevalence
rates decreased over the seven-year period was approxi-
mately equal (23% and 22%, respectively).
Table 1 shows characteristics of U.S. counties. The rate of
gun homicide ranged from 0.00 per 100,000 to 187.27
per 100,000 and the rate of nongun homicide ranged
from 0.00 per 100,000 to 97.75 per 100,000, with average
gun and nongun homicide rates of 3.25 per 100,000 and
1.38 per 100,000, respectively. The number of FFLs
ranged from 0.001 per 1,000 to 30.93 per 1,000 with an
average of 1.15 per 1,000. There were no counties without
FFLs; each county had at least one FFL active during each
study year.
Table 2 shows results of the overall statistical model,
which adjusted for covariates using regression but did not
permit for the possibility that the relation between the
prevalence of FFLs and gun homicide rates could vary over
the years of the study period and according to county type
(i.e., urbanization). The variable for percent of female
headed households was excluded during the model build-
ing process due to multicolinearity. The results based on
this overall model suggested that the prevalence of FFLs in
U.S. counties was not associated with the rate of gun hom-
icide in the county (RR = 0.98, 95% confidence interval
[CI] 0.93 to 1.04) (Table 2). However, inclusion of an
interaction term revealed that the relation between FFLs
and gun homicide was found to vary significantly by
urbanization (p < 0.01). The subsequent modeling
revealed that in major cities, a disproportionately high
prevalence of FFLs was associated with significantly higher
gun homicide rates (RR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.81)
(Table 3). Additionally, the magnitude of this association
increased significantly over the study period with an aver-
age increase of 90% per year (p < 0.001) (Figure 2). By
contrast, in other cities and in suburbs a disproportion-
ately high prevalence of FFLs was associated with signifi-
cantly lower gun homicide rates (RR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.57
to 0.93; RR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.97, respectively), and
the magnitude of these associations did not change when
tested for trend over the study period. The prevalence of
FFLs was not associated with gun homicide rates in small
towns. Inclusion of the covariate representing county-
level rates of nongun homicide did not substantively
change the results. Also, the results did not change sub-
stantively when the variable that was used to adjust for the
impact of the prevalence of FFLs in surrounding counties
was excluded from the models.
The results of the models run with FS/S used in place of
the FFL prevalence variable (not presented) were generally
consistent with our findings, although the link between
gun availability and gun homicide appeared to be even
stronger (positive) and more widespread than seen in the

analysis presented here. Importantly though, FS/S was
strongly (positively) correlated with FFL prevalence in
major cities (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.67) but
was weakly correlated and not correlated with FS/S in
other cities (0.32), suburbs (0.16), or small towns (0.07),
respectively. From this evidence it appears that FFL preva-
lence is a good proxy for firearm availability in major cit-
ies only, suggesting that the findings for how FFL
prevalence relates to gun homicide may be valid for the
findings pertaining to major cities but not to counties of
other types.
Discussion
Our analyses provide evidence of an association between
the per capita rate of licensed firearm dealers in a county
and its rate of firearm homicide. In particular, we found
that having a disproportionately high number FFLs was
associated with significantly higher rates of firearm homi-
cide in major cities. As such, FFLs may represent a risk fac-
tor for gun homicide that is modifiable. To the best of our
knowledge, the association between licensed gun dealers
and homicide rates has not previously been estimated. We
also found more FFLs to be associated with significantly
lower firearm homicide rates in other cities and in sub-
urbs. Possible explanations for both findings are dis-
cussed below.
Our evaluation strategy followed the assumption that the
number of FFLs in a county gives some indication of the
prevalence of firearms (i.e., a proxy of gun availability).
Although no available data report the number of guns
sold per dealer, the basic finding that major cities having
the most FFLs per capita also have the highest rates of gun
homicide is consistent with what is known about how
FFLs and communities relate in terms of gun availability.
Data from gun traces (a determination of the chain of
ownership, usually conducted in connection with a crim-
inal investigation) conducted by the ATF may provide the
best insight. Between July 1996 and December 1998, the
ATF conducted 1,530 trace investigations to determine
whether guns used during crimes were trafficked from an
FFL into the illegal gun market and to determine the point
of first purchase.[8] FFLs accounted for less than 10 per-
cent of the 1,530 trace investigations but for nearly half
(40,000) of all firearms involved in these traces. The aver-
age number of firearms trafficked by the FFLs under inves-
tigation was 350, which far exceeds the average number of
firearms trafficked by other means including gun shows
(130 guns), unlicensed gun dealers (75 guns), and straw
purchasers (37 guns). The large volume of firearms that
can be obtained by FFLs is possibly what underlies this
discrepancy and why FFLs may figure prominently as a
risk factor. In addition, a study where researchers tele-
phoned FFLs and posed as customers provides additional
evidence of how FFLs can facilitate the flow of guns to
criminals. Gun dealers were generally willing to sell a
handgun even when the buyer indicated an intention to
purchase the gun illegally on behalf of someone else.[30]
Other ATF data provide additional support for the possi-
bility that gun homicide is a function of local FFLs. Guns
are often found to have been used for criminal purposes

not far from the gun dealer where they were first obtained.
Approximately 62 percent of crime guns traced by the ATF
were first purchased from FFLs in the state where they
were recovered by police, one-quarter (25.9%) of crime
guns were recovered in the county where they were pur-
chased, and 10.5 percent were recovered in a county adja-
cent to the county of purchase, almost all of which were
in the same state (9.5%).[6] Moreover, almost one-third
(32.2%) of traced crime guns are recovered by police
within 10 miles of the FFL where they were first pur-
chased, and over one-third (34.3%) are recovered
between 11 and 250 miles of the FFL where they were first
purchased.[6,8] Thus, an FFL appears most likely to have
an effect in the home or surrounding counties.
A recent study showing that gun dealers in or near major
cities are at substantially elevated risk of selling guns used
in crime may help to explain the strong positive associa-
tion found here between FFL prevalence and gun homi-
cide in major cities specifically.[31] Also, we found that
the association between FFLs and gun homicides in major
cities grew stronger from 1993 to 1999. This finding is
consistent with what resulted when in the 1990s the fed-
eral government took steps to regulate FFLs more closely.
Before this time, the process to obtain a license to sell fire-
arms was appreciably simpler.[4] The Gun Control Act of
1968 required the ATF to issue a license to any applicant
who was at least 21 years old, had premises from which
they intended to conduct business, and who otherwise
was not prohibited by law from purchasing a firearm.[4]
At the time, the fee to obtain or annually renew an FFL was
$10. The ATF received an average of 33,000 applications
for FFLs each year over the decade that followed. Fully
169,052 FFLs were active by 1978. That number increased
steadily thereafter and by 1992 reached a national peak of
284,117 FFLs. Not all FFLs were legitimate businesses,
however. Any FFL enabled the holder to purchase large
numbers of firearms, often at wholesale prices, and to buy
from sellers in other states.[6] Many of these dealers made
few if any registered sales, suggesting they were not truly
engaged in the business of firearms dealing as required by
federal law, and a substantial proportion of the extant
FFLs were not in compliance with applicable federal, state,
and local laws.[4]
With the system becoming increasingly difficult for the
ATF to monitor, Congress acted and in 1993 and 1994
increased the FFL application fee 20-fold to $200 and
imposed new laws intended to shut down inactive or cor-
rupt FFLs.[4] In the years that followed, the number of
FFLs nationally dropped from about 260,000 in 1993 to
80,000 in 1999. Our effect estimates suggest that the asso-
ciation between FFL prevalence and homicide may have
been weaker in the early 1990s than in later years because
there existed a large number of low volume dealers who
contributed less to the supply of firearms.[4] Hence, with
FFLs over time becoming a better measure of the exposure
under study, the actual magnitude of the association

between FFLs and gun homicide may be more accurately
portrayed in the last few years of our study.
In contrast to what was observed for major cities, we
found a negative association between gun homicide and
FFL prevalence in other cities and suburbs. When consid-
ered in conjunction with the finding that FFL prevalence
and FS/S are correlated strongly in major cities but corre-
lated weakly in other cities and suburbs, this suggests that
FFL prevalence is not a good proxy for gun availability in
other cities and suburbs and hence the models based on
those areas should not be interpreted as providing valid
estimates of the relation between gun availability and gun
homicide. We can consider these findings in light of our
understanding of how the relation between FFLs and gun
homicide may vary across counties of different urbaniza-
tion types. In major city areas with higher crime rates,
there will be greater criminal demand for guns and, hence,
a larger illegal market for guns. It thus seems more likely
that a weapon sold in a major city, as compared to one
sold in another county type, will end up in the hands of a
criminal user through theft, straw purchase, gun traffick-
ing, or some other kind of transaction in the secondhand
market. Also, it is possible that handguns rather than long
guns account for a higher share of guns sold in major cit-
ies. Further, it would also stand to reason that an "aver-
age" gun possessor has a greater chance of using a gun
criminally in an area with higher rates of gun violence.
Also, gun culture and the roles of guns in peoples' lives
vary dramatically across urban-rural continuum. Firearm
ownership is more widespread in rural areas than urban
areas, so the need to purchase a firearm from an FFL may
be less necessary in rural than urban areas. The role of fire-
arms certainly varies by county type in terms of firearm
mortality, in that rates of firearm-related mortality in the
U.S. are equally high in both the most urban and the most
rural counties, with the nuance being that it is the gun
homicide rate that is high in the most urban counties and
it is the gun suicide rate that is high in the most rural
counties.[20] Each of these points highlights the impor-
tance of stratifying analyses by county type and identify-
ing variables that measure firearm availability accurately
in the county type at the focus of a particular study, an
important point that has been made previously.[32] The
FS/S comparisons suggest that the FFL variable used here
provides an adequate proxy in major city counties alone.
If the FFL variable is not a good proxy for gun availability
in counties we have defined as other cities and suburbs,
our analyses cannot inform the issue of how gun availabil-
ity relates to gun homicide in counties of these types. It
may be the case that the impact of guns on a community
may vary by community type and may be protective in
other cities and suburbs. In one study of 170 U.S. cities
with a population of at least 100,000, however, rates of
homicide and of gun-related assault were found to be pos-
itively associated with the prevalence of firearms.[33]
Even so, it is possible that the mixing in that study of what
we have termed major cities, other cities and suburbs may
have prevented the authors from detecting modification
of this effect across area type. Another study of counties in
Illinois initially found that the rate of firearm ownership
was negatively associated with all measures of violent
crime, including homicide, but had failed to control for
urbanization.[34] Subsequent multivariate analyses with
control for urbanization found no significant association
between the rate of firearm ownership and homicide. A
number of ecologic studies conducted at the state level
[10,14] and individual-level studies [35-37] alike have
found firearm availability to be a risk factor for homicide
rather than a protective factor, yet other studies have not
found clear effects of the relation between gun availability
and homicide, e.g.,[34,38] and a recent National Acad-
emy of Sciences report concluded that the body of
research on this topic is inconclusive.[39] Our findings
highlight the need to account for urbanization in the stud-
ies that will follow.
Our analysis had several strengths. First, it was conducted
at the county level to account for within-state variability in
homicide rates and FFL prevalence. This also allowed us to
control for the possibilities that the homicide rate in a
county was influenced by FFLs in surrounding counties
and by the leniency or permissiveness of neighboring state
firearm laws. Second, our analysis examined the link
between FFLs and homicide over county urbanization
type. Third, the study years coincided with a period when
changes to federal firearm licensing regulations produced
a change in the composition of the pool of FFLs nation-
ally. As FFLs became fewer the pool became more homog-
enous, and hence may have provided an exposure variable
that became a better measure of gun availability over time.
The finding that the association between FFLs and gun
homicide in major cities grew stronger over time adds
support to our interpretation of the results, as does the
finding based on our comparison with FS/S that FFL prev-
alence appears to be a good proxy for gun availability in
counties defined as major cities but not in other county
types.
Also, two aspects of the present study are unique and have
implications for how firearm homicide is studied and
how the incidence of firearm homicide may be reduced.
First, because the link between gun homicide and gun
availability (as measured by the prevalence of FFLs) was
found to vary significantly within states according to the
urbanization levels of counties, it appears that studies
conducted using broader geographic units of analysis
(states, census divisions, etc.) may fail to detect important
nuances in the nature of gun availability.

Second, to the best of our knowledge, our study, in focus-
ing on gun dealers as a potential risk factor for homicide,
is the first to assess a tangible measure of gun availability
that can be modified as part of prevention activities. Law
enforcement, city planners, and legal strategists in cities
with high gun homicide rates can concretely focus in on
excessive or problem gun dealers as opposed to the more
nebulous issue of "gun availability." Moreover, local
efforts to close down illegal gun commerce have already
shown the potential to be effective.[33,40,41] As one
example, zoning laws, which control the location and
operation of stores and individual dealers licensed to sell
firearms, have been used to regulate locations of FFLs in
several U.S. communities.[11,12,42] An attempt to
launch a coordinated effort to identify and act on prob-
lematic gun dealers will surely face challenges, however.
For one, a key component of such efforts will be the polic-
ing activities of the ATF which, in having inspected fewer
than 10% of FFLs in each year since 1979 and fewer than
5% of FFLs in most of those years, may have resources
insufficient for the task.[6]
Our analysis also had limitations. As discussed, we could
not account for the actual volume of firearms introduced
by each FFL into the community. Although gun sales data
are not currently available for a more focused test, the
recent National Academy of Sciences report called for bet-
ter information on FFLs to be collected and made availa-
ble for research.[39] Additionally, we did not explicitly
accommodate spatial autocorrelation in the estimation of
the FFL effect estimates. Refitting the models presented in
Table 2 and Table 3 including a simultaneous autoregres-
sive (SAR) structure,[43] assuming that correlation
declined in proportion to the square of the distance
between counties, generally changed coefficients by less
than 5%. Also, data for FFLs for years after 1999 were not
available. Thus we could not analyze a more recent
period. Nevertheless, we do not anticipate that the rela-
tion observed here between FFLs and homicide would
have changed since the study period and thus this charac-
teristic of the data should not be interpreted as devaluing
the findings. Finally, it may be that high rates of homicide
may lead to increased demand for firearms and hence
additional FFLs, in which case the results of the "FFL as
risk factor" hypothesis that our models have been
designed to test would be spurious. A stronger analytic
approach would be to test whether within-county
increases in FFL prevalence were followed by increases in
the rate of gun homicide. We considered that approach,
but found many instances in which a county experienced
no gun homicides in certain years but some homicides in
the subsequent year, which prevents an annual change in
homicide rate from being calculated. Also, as discussed
above, we found evidence that FFL prevalence became a
better proxy for firearm availability over time, which led
to our preference for the 1999 models and our judgment
to refrain from including change models in the current
manuscript. An instrumental variable approach could be
pursued as well, to attempt to remove from the models
the influence of circularity that may exist. We hope this
manuscript will inform how such design alternatives may
be approached, and acknowledge their need given the
cross-sectional nature of the present study.
Conclusion
If locations of retailers licensed to sell firearms are indeed
functioning as a spigot through which deadly firearms
flow into criminal hands, then communities with greater
geographic access to these dealers should ostensibly expe-
rience more firearm homicides. Our findings are consist-
ent with the hypothesis that this is occurring in major U.S.
cities. The modification of FFLs, as tangible entities that
are tracked and overseen at the national level and, in some
cases, at the state and local levels, may be a feasible inter-
vention to reduce firearm homicide.
