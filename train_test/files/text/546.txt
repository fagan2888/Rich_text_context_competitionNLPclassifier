Objectives.To describe the rationale for the pain presence, location, and intensity measures in the National Social
Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP).
Method.Responses to the pain presence, location (pain map), and intensity (verbal descriptor scale) items were
analyzed by gender and age (62­69, 70­79, and 80­91). Pain intensity was dichotomized (none to mild vs moderate or
higher) and compared by demographics, physical function, mood, and self-rated health. All analyses used Wald tests to
compare sample means.
Results.Participants completed the pain presence (n = 2,430/2,799), location (n = 2,558/2,799), and intensity
(n = 2,589/2,799) items. Pain items varied by gender with women reporting more head, arm, hip/buttock, leg, and foot
pain compared to men, (p < .05) at each individual site. Women also reported more intense pain compared to men--2.13
versus 1.94, respectively (p < .05). Pain items demonstrated remarkable similarity among age cohorts. Health indicators
were significant and in the expected direction (p < .001). An increase in comorbidity, ADL and IADL dependence, worse
self-rated health, and more depressive symptoms were each significantly more common among participants who reported
moderate or greater pain compared to none to mild pain.
Discussion. Pain presence, location, and intensity measures were successfully integrated into NSHAP Wave 2 and
exhibit construct and external validity.
Key Words: Location--Measurement--Older adult--Pain.
The perception of pain is a universal experience and
alerts us to internal and external threats to our integ-
rity (Woolf, American College of Physicians, & American
Physiological Society, 2004). Acute pain generally repre-
sents a noxious stimulus produced by injury and/or disease,
is limited in its duration, and serves a protective function.
In contrast, persistent (e.g., chronic) pain lasts beyond the
usual course of an acute process, injury, or chronic patho-
logical process and lacks a meaningful biologic function
(Woolf et al., 2004). Persistent pain can last for months or
years and manifest symptoms intermittently or continu-
ously (AGS Panel on Persistent Pain in Older Persons,
2002; Thielke et al., 2012). The discomfort and suffering
associated with persistent pain substantially impacts the
well-being and health of older adults including poorer phys-
ical, psychological, and social outcomes compared to older
adults without pain (AGS Panel on Persistent Pain in Older
Persons, 2002; Blyth et al., 2008; Buchman et al., 2010;
Gibson & Lussier, 2012; Reitsma, Tranmer, Buchanan,
& Vandenkerkhof, 2011; Scudds & Ostbye, 2001; Shega,
Dale, et al., 2012; D. Weiner, Peterson, & Keefe, 1998).
The elucidation of reliable and valid reports of a
patient's pain experience is paramount in order to bet-
ter delineate the relationships between persistent pain and
health in older adults. This can be obtained from several
sources including self-report, proxy report, and an assess-
ment of pain behaviors, of which self-report is considered
the gold standard (AGS Panel on Persistent Pain in Older
Persons, 2002; K. Herr, 2011; K. Herr, Spratt, Garand, &
Li, 2007; K. A. Herr, Spratt, Mobily, & Richardson, 2004).
Multidimensional pain measures, such as the Brief Pain
Inventory and McGill Pain Questionnaire (Atkinson et al.,
2011; Caraceni et al., 2002; Melzack, 1975), provide a
comprehensive assessment of a person's pain experience
including pain descriptors, exacerbating and relieving fac-
tors, impact of analgesia, and an extensive inventory of
pain-related interference with physical and psychological
functioning. However, the time needed to complete these
instruments and the specificity of the questions to pain-
related impairment usually limits the use of these measures
to studies whose primary objective focuses on pain-related
outcomes.
Unidimensional pain measures (e.g., pain intensity) pro-
vide an alternative approach to capturing a person's pain
experience. These measures benefit from minimal respond-
ent burden, a rapid administration time, and strong psy-
chometric properties. Unidimensional measures include
the numeric rating scale (NRS) (e.g., 0 to 10-point scale),
visual analogue scale (VAS) (e.g., continuous line anchored
by two end-points), and the verbal descriptor scale (VDS)
S191
SHEGA ET AL.
(e.g., verbal terms express the level of pain). The response
to these scales can then be used to determine the propor-
tion of participants with pain, its intensity, and the relation-
ship between pain and other health-related conditions, such
as depressive symptoms or physical health. Unfortunately,
unidimensional pain scales do not permit an evaluation of
other important pain-related characteristics captured by
multidimensional scales.
In response to the burgeoning evidence surrounding the
relationship between pain and physical, psychological, and
social health among community-dwelling older adults, the
National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP)
incorporated a pain assessment. Pain measurement in Wave
1 focused on pain presence in the lower extremity. Wave 2
incorporated a more comprehensive pain assessment includ-
ing its presence, location, and intensity. In this article, we
describe the rationale for selecting the pain measures for
NSHAPWave 2, derive information regarding its internal and
external validity, and provide recommendations for measure
use as an outcome or covariate for NSHAP-related research.
Method
Overview
NSHAP is a nationally representative, longitudinal sur-
vey designed to investigate the complex interplay of social,
biological, emotional, and environmental factors that come
with aging. Persistent pain represents a common experience
among older adults with a theoretical as well as empirical
role in aging trajectories (Blyth et al., 2008; Shega, Dale,
et al., 2012). Despite this, epidemiologic studies of aging
frequently overlook pain assessment or select measures
not adequately validated in older persons. Moreover, stud-
ies that incorporate a pain measure maintain noteworthy
limitations, including an assessment of pain presence but
not intensity, measurement in one wave but not others, and/
or failure to assess pain uniformly across multiple waves
(Scudds & Ostbye, 2001; Thielke et al., 2012). As a result,
the longitudinal relationship of pain with health at the popu-
lation level remains poorly understood.
In Wave 1, pain presence was assessed in the lower
extremity while walking (see Table 1).
In Wave 2, investigators sought to integrate a more robust
pain measure in order to address the shortcomings of previ-
ous studies as described above, and to better understand the
relationship of pain with health. Given the time and space
constraints within NSHAP, investigators elected to incor-
porate a brief, yet scientifically rigorous assessment of per-
sistent pain, including its presence, location, and intensity.
A literature review was conducted along with input from
pain and aging experts (J. W. S. and W. D.) to establish opti-
mal measures.

Measures
The stem portion of the questions assessing pain pres-
ence, location, and intensity helps differentiate whether
pain reports represent acute or persistent pain (see Table 1).
This is particularly important as acute pain represents a
normal biologic response and serves an important physi-
ologic function, whereas persistent pain lasts beyond its
signal value and is considered to lack a meaningful purpose
(Woolf et al., 2004). Pain represents a continuum with cut
point between acute, subacute, and persistent being some-
what arbitrary. Persistent pain generally lasts for weeks
to months from which we selected a threshold of 4 weeks

PAIN MEASUREMENT IN THE NSHAP
duration representing persistent pain (Scudds & Ostbye,
2001; Turk & Okifuji, 2001). While 4-week duration was
used in NSHAP Wave 2 to capture persistent pain, we can-
not exclude the possibility that these reports may signify
acute or subacute pain.
Ascertainment of pain location is important as it adds
another dimension to the epidemiology of pain in older
adults, facilitates treatment choices (e.g., medical manage-
ment with pharmacologic therapy, physical and/or occupa-
tional therapy, and/or assist devices), and can be utilized
to better capture pain-related functional impairment (D.
Weiner et al., 1998). The pain map, as depicted in Figure 1,
adapted from Margolis et al., has undergone rigorous reli-
ability and validity testing in older populations (Margolis,
Chibnall, & Tait, 1988; D. Weiner et al., 1998). As such, it
is widely recognized as the pain location measure of choice
in older adults with and without cognitive impairment.
The front and back of a body is divided into 45 areas and
respondents circle painful locations. These numbered body
areas correspond to 1 of 12 body locations, as described
in Figure 1. In Wave 2, we asked participants to indicate
where they have felt the most pain in the past 4 weeks (see
Table 1). Over half of Wave 2 respondents indicated more
than one painful location.
TheVDS was selected as the pain intensity measure based
upon the findings of several landmark studies examining the
psychometric properties of unidimensional pain measures
in older populations (K. Herr, 2011; K. Herr et al., 2007;
K. A. Herr et al., 2004). Older adults routinely choose the
VDS (compared to the NRS and VAS) as the most preferred
unidimensional pain intensity measure (K. Herr et al., 2007;
K. A. Herr et al., 2004; Peters, Patijn, & Lamé, 2007). Also,
the VDS demonstrated the highest completion rates when
directly compared to other unidimensional measures (K.
Herr et al., 2007; K. A. Herr et al., 2004). Lastly, the VDS
exhibits superior reliability and validity compared to other
unidimensional measures in older adults from different eth-
nicities and range of cognitive abilities (K. Herr, 2002; Li,
Herr, & Chen, 2009; Taylor, Harris, Epps, & Herr, 2005).
Table 1 displays the stem and response categories for the
VDS incorporated into Wave 2.
We recommend the pain descriptors be recoded into
the following numeric format: 0 = no pain, 1 = slight
pain, 2 = mild pain, 3 = moderate pain, 4 = severe pain,
5 = extreme pain, and 6 = the most intense pain imaginable.
In this format, verbal pain descriptors can be readily trans-
lated into numeric values to facilitate data analysis with
pain as a predictor or outcome (Scudds & Ostbye, 2001;
Shega, Andrew, et al., 2012). Also, the pain intensity meas-
ure can be dichotomized at the moderate intensity level
and greater (e.g., no pain, slight pain, mild pain vs moder-
ate pain, severe pain, extreme pain, and the most intense
pain imaginable) to better ascertain clinically relevant pain
(Collins, Moore, & McQuay, 1997; Shega, Andrew, et al.,
2012; D. K. Weiner et al., 2003).
The data collection process in NSHAP included three
components: (a) an in-home face-to-face interview; (b) a
collection of biomeasures; and (c) a leave-behind self-
administered questionnaire. The pain questions for Wave 1
and 2 were assessed in the leave-behind self-administered
questionnaire. Pain presence with walking in Wave 1 was
completed by 82.3% of respondents. Among Wave 2 sam-
ple respondents, 2,949 of 3,337 completed and returned the
leave-behind questionnaire of which 2,799 were age eligi-
ble for the current analysis. The pain questions were asked
in the order and format displayed in Table 1. Pain presence

SHEGA ET AL.
was followed by location, and intensity with response
rates of 86.8%, 91.4%, and 92.5%, respectively. A portion
of respondents did not answer the pain presence question
(n = 396), but subsequently answered the location (n = 170)
and intensity (n = 204) items as reflected by the larger sam-
ple size for these later groups. See Figure 2 for a flow dia-
gram displaying participant response to pain-related items
based upon response to the pain presence question. These
respondents were coded as "missing" for analyses of the
pain presence item in this article. However, researchers may
consider recoding the skipped pain presence responses as
"yes" or "no" based upon the responses to the subsequent
pain location or intensity measures. Investigators should
establish their analytic approach a priori depending upon
the research question. Also, participants who reported no
pain in the past 4 weeks on the pain presence question were
directed to skip the subsequent two questions on pain loca-
tion and intensity. These participants (n = 798) were subse-
quently identified as "missing legitimately" for the latter 2
questions and coded as a "no pain" response.
Statistical Analysis
In order to generate an inter-wave robustness test of pain
responses, we ran Pearson's correlations between the simi-
lar, but not identical, measures capturing walking pain at
Wave 1 and pain location at Wave 2, limiting the analysis
to Wave 1 returning respondents. Of note, a series of ques-
tions also evaluated sex-related lower extremity pain at
Wave 1; however, these items were not examined in this
analysis since they are more appropriately intended for use
with the NSHAP sexual measures. Eleven out of the 12
body locations assessed in Wave 2 demonstrated significant
associations with Wave 1 walking pain (data not presented).
Walking pain at Wave 1 was positively correlated with
all lower body extremity pain sites at Wave 2-hip/buttock
( = .11, p < .001), genital ( = .08, p < .01), leg ( = .19,
p < .001), and foot pain ( = .15, p < .001).
Summary statistics were generated for walking pain,
pain presence, location, and intensity. Sample means
by gender and age (Table 2) were compared using Wald
tests. In order to examine mean differences among the
three age categories, the pain measures were regressed
on age, followed by the Wald tests. Pain intensity reports
were dichotomized (no to mild pain vs moderate pain
or greater) among Wave 2 respondents and compared
by demographic characteristics along with physical and
mental health status (Table 3). The analytic sample was
first compared to the nonrespondent group, as a portion
of respondents neglected to answer the pain items which
varied by age (75.4 and 72.1, p < .01) and female gender
(60.2 and 51.7, p = .06), item nonresponse and response,
respectively.
Results
Mean pain presence, location, and intensity by gen-
der and age are presented in Table 2. In general, women
reported more pain by location and intense pain than
men. Among women who completed the pain location
measure, leg (40.2%), back (25.5%), foot (19.7%), and
hip/buttock (19.7%) were the most common painful

sites. Among men who completed the pain location
measure, leg (30.9%), back (22.7%), shoulder (17.6%),
and foot (15.3%) were the most frequently reported
painful locations. In addition, women described more
head, arm, hip/buttock, leg, and foot pain compared to
men, (p < .05) at each individual site. Women reported
more intense pain compared to men--1.94 versus 2.13,
respectively (p < .05).
Next, Table 2 compares mean pain reports of presence,
location, and intensity according to age cohorts specified at
62­69, 70­79, and 80 and above. The results demonstrate
that although there were some qualitative differences in
pain presence, location, and intensity, only a few reached
statistical significance. Older respondents reported more
head pain and chest pain, but less genital pain than younger
respondents (p < .05).
Pain reports categorized as no to mild versus moder-
ate or greater among Wave 2 respondents by demographic
characteristics along with physical and mental health fac-
tors are displayed in Table 3. Women were more likely to
report moderate or greater rather than none to mild pain,
55.2% versus 48.2%, respectively (p < .05). High school
graduates reported lower rates of moderate or greater
compared to none to mild pain, 82.3% versus 87.5%,
respectively (p < .01). All of the health indicators were
significant and in the expected direction (p < .001). An
increase in comorbidity, ADL and IADL disability, poorer
self-reported health, and more depressive symptoms were
each significantly more common in participants who
reported moderate or greater pain compared to none to
mild pain.
Discussion
Pain presence, location, and intensity questions were suc-
cessfully incorporated into NSHAP Wave 2 with acceptable
response rates for a leave-behind questionnaire. Participants
who reported walking pain at Wave 1 were more likely to
report lower extremity pain (e.g., hip/buttocks, genital, leg,
and feet pain) at Wave 2. Pain was commonly reported as
49.8% of the sample endorsed moderate or greater pain in
the past 4 weeks. Moreover, moderate or greater pain was
associated with worse health, including increasing comor-
bidity, ADL and IADL disability, poorer self-reported
health, and additional depressive symptoms compared to
persons who reported none to mild pain.
Among age eligible Wave 2 participants, over half indi-
cated pain in more than one body area. Based upon ques-
tion wording and respondent reporting, we recommend
investigators interpret the pain location measure as marked
areas corresponding to painful locations. However, we do
not believe these areas necessarily represent locations of
the most intense pain, nor can one infer an absence of
markings indicating no painful locations. The convergent
and predictive validity of the pain location measure is sup-
ported by the correlation of respondents reporting pain in
the lower extremity in Wave 1 and an increased likelihood
of circling painful areas in the lower extremity in Wave
2. Moreover, respondents indicated lower extremity pain
(e.g., leg, back, and foot) was more common than other
locations such as head, upper extremity, and chest, as
has been demonstrated in other older adult samples, sup-
porting the measures' external validity (D. Weiner et al.,
1998).

SHEGA ET AL.
The proportion of respondents who report "any pain" and
"moderate or greater pain" resemble findings from other
community-dwelling, older adult, population-based sam-
ples, conducted in the US, Canada, and Europe (Donald
& Foy, 2004; Gibson & Lussier, 2012; Hadjistavropoulos
et al., 2007; Jakobsson, Klevsgård, Westergren, & Hallberg,
2003; Reitsma et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2010). The propor-
tion of older adults who report pain varies from 30% to 80%,
depending upon the study. Variations in pain report may
stem from sample characteristics including participant loca-
tion (e.g., community-dwelling, assisted living facility, and/
or nursing home) along with patient specific factors such as
comorbidity and the presence of cognitive impairment, as
well as characteristics of the pain measure itself. The fact
that the prevalence of pain in our sample mirrors that of
other studies further substantiates the external validity of
the pain presence and intensity measures incorporated into
NSHAP Wave 2. Importantly, item nonresponse did vary
by gender and age. Therefore, researchers interested in the
relationship of pain with these variables should consider an
adjustment for differential nonresponse to minimize bias.
The construct validity of the NSHAP pain intensity
measure is further supported by the association of mod-
erate and greater pain with poorer health. Pain intensity
demonstrates the predictive relationship of pain with physi-
cal, psychological, and overall health among older adults
(Eggermont, Penninx, Jones, & Leveille, 2012; Leveille
et al., 2009; Parmelee, Harralson, McPherron, DeCoster,
& Schumacher, 2012; Scudds et al., 2001; Shega, Andrew,
et al., 2012; Shega, Dale, et al., 2012; D. K. Weiner et al.,
2003). We generated the NSHAP measure based on the
criterion of previous research that utilized verbal descrip-
tor scales, and these results meet expectations for an older
sample (K. Herr, 2002, 2010, 2011; K. Herr et al., 2007).
Table 3 presents evidence for concurrent validity since
moderate or greater pain was associated with additional
physical disability and depressive symptoms as well as
poorer self-reported health compared to those with no or
mild pain. Moderate or greater pain was also associated
with additional comorbid conditions, many of which are
associated with persistent pain, such as arthritis, diabetes,
and osteoporosis. These results can be used as guidelines
by analysts who wish to distinguish between the health of
at least two sub-samples of respondents by self-reported
pain intensity. While the above findings argue the "4 week"
time-frame in the stem of the pain item represents persis-
tent pain, such report may also represent other designations
on the pain continuum including acute or subacute pain,
thereby limiting generalizability.
We recommend that investigators interested in pain as
an outcome dichotomize the intensity measure at the mod-
erate intensity level and greater (e.g., no pain, slight pain,
mild pain vs moderate pain, severe pain, extreme pain,
and the most intense pain imaginable). This represents
"clinically relevant pain" or pain associated with physical,
psychological, and social health (Collins et al., 1997; Shega,
Dale, et al., 2012; D. K. Weiner et al., 2003). When pain is
used as a predictor, investigators may elect to use either the
pain intensity measure at the cutoff of moderate intensity
or higher or the pain presence measure (yes or no). It is
important to note that the verbal descriptor levels maintain
ordinal and not interval properties. That is, the increase in
physical, psychological, and social impairment between
pain levels (e.g., mild to moderate vs moderate to severe)
is not equivalent.
In conclusion, we were able to successfully incorporate a
pain presence, location, and intensity measure into NSHAP
Wave 2. The robustness of the variables is supported by a
high completion rate of pain items by respondents along with
evidence of external validity. Researchers can utilize the pain
measures as a predictor or outcome and as a continuous or
dichotomous variable depending upon the research question.
NSHAP investigators hope and encourage researchers to use
these measures to further our understanding of the relation-
ship between pain and health, particularly social health.

Key Points
·
· NSHAP Wave 2 introduced pain presence, location
and intensity measures with response rates that resem-
bled previous North American and European studies.
·
· The congruent and predictive validity of pain loca-
tion items was supported by significant correlations
between Wave 1 walking pain and Wave 2 lower
extremity pain.
·
· More than half of the sample reported moderate or
greater pain, confirming past research. We recom-
mend designating moderate pain as a threshold for
users investigating the correlates of pain intensity.
·
· Gender was a key predictor of anatomic location and
intensity of pain, whereas age was associated with a
few painful locations.
