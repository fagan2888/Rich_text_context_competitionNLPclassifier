Study objective: Outline the use of the pairwise odds ratio (PWOR) to quantify the extent to which a binary
outcome clusters geographically. Quantify the extent to which first experience with cocaine is spatially
correlated within US neighbourhoods and cities. Quantify geographical clustering of first experience with
cocaine by neighbourhood context.
Design: Estimate the PWOR of incident cocaine experience at two levels (neighbourhood, city) and
compare across years. Within years, estimate the PWOR by neighbourhood disadvantage and test for
trend.
Setting: US National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.
Participants: Civilian, non-institutionalised household residents of the United States age 12 years and
older interviewed in person during 1979, 1988, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993.
Main results: First experience with cocaine clusters within US neighbourhoods and cities. There is some
evidence that the spatial correlation of first experience with cocaine increases with percentage of
neighbourhood households living in poverty.
Conclusions: The gradient in spatial correlation of incident cocaine experience by neighbourhood poverty
level is consistent with current theories of concentrated disadvantage. The possibility that the direction of
the poverty gradient might change over the course of a drug epidemic is discussed.
Early epidemiological investigations of infectious disease,
such as John Snow's study of cholera, often focused on
geographical variation in the occurrence of disease. They
compared and contrasted the characteristics of geographical
areas in which disease clustered in an effort to uncover
aetiological clues. Snow pinpointed cases on maps that led
him to discover that geographical context was essential to the
spread of cholera in London; the disease clustered in areas
served by a water company that drew from the polluted
downstream Thames but hardly at all in areas served by its
competitor, which drew from an upstream source.1 Recently,
there has been a resurgence of interest in the context of
health and illness (characteristics of the physical and social
environment) as witnessed by the proliferation of ``contex-
tual,''2 ``multilevel,''3 and ``hierarchical''4 studies in the public
health and social science literatures.5 6 Some epidemiologists
have called for the context of disease, geographical and
otherwise, to be incorporated into risk factor epidemiology,
the long dominant approach that focuses on associations
between individual level risk factors and the risk of illness
without necessarily considering the broader context of
aetiology.7 8
The contextual approach seeks to open the ``black box''9 of
risk factor epidemiology by examining whether contexts
might place people at risk of risks for illness.10 This study and
our previous work11 incorporate geographical clustering, a
notion central to early epidemiology, into the contextual
approach to epidemiology that has recently become popular.
Whereas contextual analyses typically analyse whether
geographically defined contexts are associated with the risk
of disease, our approach examines whether such contexts are
related to the geographical clustering of disease. To demon-
strate our approach, we examine the extent to which incident
experience with cocaine clusters in relation to the geogra-
phical context in which it occurs. Historical distance from the
US cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s12 coupled
with the availability of data from geographically sampled
survey data collected during those years make cocaine a
worthy candidate for this approach to contextual analysis.
In this paper we address two research questions. Firstly,
does incident experience with cocaine cluster geographically
and, if so, is the observed spatial correlation an artefact of
neighbourhood composition? Secondly, in an attempt to
better understand the spatial correlation of cocaine, this
paper takes a cue from previous drug research and examines
whether the magnitude of clustering of cocaine incidence is
associated with neighbourhood disadvantage.13­15
The Office of National Drug Control Policy estimated that
the economic costs of illegal drug misuse in the United States
(health care costs, loss in productivity, crime related costs,
and social welfare costs) rose from $102.2 billion in 1992 to
$143.4 billion in 1998 and projected the cost would rise to
$160.7 billion in 2000.16 Recent reports indicate that cocaine
use, especially in the form of ``crack,'' is growing rapidly in
Europe, most notably in Britain.17­19 Given cocaine's past cost
to and impact on the health of the United States, we believe
this study presents a timely examination of the spatial
correlation of cocaine incidence and its possible association
with neighbourhood disadvantage.
METHODS
This paper reports the results of analyses of public use data
from six years of the National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse (NHSDA): 1979, 1988, and 1990 to 1993.20­25 The use of
multiple years of data facilitates an examination of whether
the results replicate. These six years are examined, in part,
because their corresponding data were available as NHSDA

public use files at the time this study was conceived. More
importantly, they were collected during the downward turn
in the most recent cocaine epidemic in the United States.12 26
Data from more recent years, after the cocaine epidemic had
subsided, might provide misleading results as the underlying
factors responsible for the epidemic might have subsided. For
example, if the present analyses used data from years in
which the incidence of cocaine use had fallen to levels lower
than those observed during epidemic years, fewer neighbour-
hood residents would be starting cocaine use, making it more
difficult to detect an association with neighbourhood socio-
economic status.
The NHSDA is a multistage area probability sample of
civilian, non-institutionalised household residents of the
United States age 12 years and older. It was first conducted
in 1971, then periodically during the 1970s and 1980s, and
has been conducted annually since 1990. Before the 1991
survey, only the 48 contiguous states were sampled; Alaska
and Hawaii were included beginning with the 1991 survey.
The primary sampling units (PSUs) randomly selected in the
first stage of sampling were standard metropolitan statistical
areas, counties, groups of counties and independent cities, or
portions of counties, or other well defined geographical units;
for ease of discussion, PSUs will hereinafter be referred to as
``cities,'' the lay geographical term to which they most closely
correspond. The 1990 survey oversampled the Washington,
DC metropolitan area; the 1991­1993 surveys added over-
samples of metropolitan Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles,
Miami, and New York City. ``Segments'' within cities were
selected in the second stage of sampling. Segments were
defined using aggregations of census blocks and enumeration
districts that contained a maximum of 1000 and a minimum
of 40 (in 1988) to 90 (in 1993) occupied housing units
according to the 1980 census or, in the case of the 1992 and
1993 surveys, the 1990 census. For ease of discussion,
segments will hereinafter be referred to as their closest lay
equivalent--``neighbourhoods.'' Housing units (hereinafter
referred to as ``households'') within neighbourhoods were
selected in the third stage of sampling. The fourth and final
stage of sampling entailed selecting zero, one or two
respondents from individual households. Complete details
of the survey design and sampling procedures can be found
in official NHSDA publications. Once respondents were
identified, they were recruited into the study according to
guidelines approved by an Institutional Review Board.
Respondents who agreed to participate answered some
interview questions by responding to questions read aloud
to them by an interviewer who recorded their oral answers.
Respondents answered sensitive questions such as those
regarding drug use by reading them from an answer sheet on
which they also marked their own replies, which remained
unknown to the interviewer. The interview response rate
ranged from 77% in 1988 to 84% in 1991.27­32
The NHSDA interview contained modules that include
standardised questions about use, opportunity to use, and
perceived harm of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. It also
contained a module of questions about demographic char-
acteristics of respondents and their families. Beginning with
the 1988 survey, respondents were instructed that all
questions about cocaine should be interpreted to include
both the powder form of cocaine and crack cocaine unless a
question asked specifically about crack cocaine. Accordingly,
this study examines both forms of cocaine.
The inclusion of multiple respondents from a household
might tend to inflate estimates of geographical clustering
when using simpler statistical models. To expedite statistical
computations, a single respondent was randomly selected
from within those households in which more than one
interview was conducted. Furthermore, to estimate the
extent to which incident cocaine experience clusters, subjects
who were not ``at risk'' for the respective outcomes had to be
removed from the samples. The samples used for this study
were therefore smaller than the total sample sizes on the
NHSDA public use files.
Variables
This paper examines two outcomes that reflect incident
experience with cocaine. Two binary (yes/no) outcomes were
constructed from responses to the following two questions30:
(1) ``About how old were you when you first had a chance to
try cocaine, in any form, if you had wanted to?''; (2) ``About
how old were you the first time you actually used cocaine, in
any form, even once?'' The two outcomes will be referred to
herein as first had opportunity and first used cocaine,
respectively.
If neighbourhoods and cities differ in terms of their
composition with respect to factors associated with these
outcomes, it is possible that estimates of geographical
clustering could be artefacts of these differences. For this
reason, seven categorical sociodemographic covariates asso-
ciated with cocaine use33 are incorporated into all of the
models reported herein in an effort to examine whether their
statistical adjustment might attenuate the estimates of
geographical clustering of the outcomes. These seven
categorical covariates are: age, race, hispanic ethnicity, sex,
marital status, employment status, and educational attain-
ment.
Two additional individual level categorical covariates were
also included in the analyses for the purposes of adjustment.
People from the same socioeconomic status (SES) tend to
cluster their residences in self selected neighbourhoods.34
Because this paper examines whether cocaine outcomes
cluster based on geographical area of residence, it is therefore
necessary to adjust for SES. We use the combination of
educational attainment and occupation to measure SES.35
Because adolescents were included in the sample, we
measure occupation of chief wage earner (CWE) in house-
hold, which breaks the Census Bureau's 16 occupational
groups into six categories.36 Two additional categories were
added to accommodate respondents who: (a) reported their
households had no CWE or that the household CWE does not
work; (b) did not report the occupation of their household
CWE.
The other individual level covariate included for the
purposes of adjustment is residential mobility. This binary
covariate (moved/did not move) was constructed from
responses to the following question: ``How many times in
the past five years have you moved?''23 Beyond its reported
association with the cocaine outcomes,33 residential mobility
is used in an attempt to adjust for the presence of selection
effects. Cocaine users might cluster in particular neighbour-
hoods by way of two different processes or some combination
thereof. People with a proclivity to use or have opportunity to
use cocaine might migrate to certain locations, thereby
selecting the neighbourhoods in which they cluster.
Selection effects might also occur when persons who are
not likely to use or have opportunity to use cocaine selectively
migrate from particular neighbourhoods, leaving behind a
cluster of persons who do have these characteristics.37 The
analyses reported in this paper attempt to adjust for selection
effects by incorporating this measure of residential mobility
as a covariate in our analyses.
Finally, of the few neighbourhood level measures of
neighbourhood disadvantage available on the NHSDA public
use data files examined herein, we chose the only one that
allowed for examination of a gradient in within neighbour-
hood clustering. This measure of disadvantage, percentage of
households in poverty, is derived from 1990 census data. It is

included only on the 1992 and 1993 NHSDA public use files
and appears as a six category variable (quintiles plus a
missing category) to prevent possible disclosure of any
respondent's identity.
Statistical methods
The extent to which the binary cocaine outcomes co-occur
within geographical areas can be quantified using alternating
logistic regressions (ALR), a recently developed statistical
method.38 The ALR method uses first order generalised
estimating equations39 to regress a binary outcome on
covariates while simultaneously estimating a pairwise odds
ratio (PWOR) by regressing each binary response in a
geographical area on others from the same geographical
area. To address the first research question, we use ALR to
quantify the extent to which first experience with cocaine
clusters within US cities and neighbourhoods. To quantify
geographical clustering in this way necessitates the estima-
tion of nested models because neighbourhoods are nested
within cities. To address the second research question, we use
ALR with a contextual pairwise model to quantify the extent to
which incident experience with cocaine clusters within
neighbourhoods by level of neighbourhood disadvantage
(see appendix).
RESULTS
Table 1 displays the number of cities, neighbourhoods and
respondents in each of the six NHSDA samples after removal
of respondents not ``at risk'' of the respective outcome (that is,
those who had their first opportunity to use cocaine, or first
used cocaine, more than five years ago). The two incidence
measures declined steadily between 1979 and 1993: First had
opportunity drops from 15.6% of respondents in 1979 to 8.0%
of the 1993 sample. First used cocaine falls from 8.4% of
respondents in 1979 to 2.8% of the 1993 sample. (Because of
space limitations, cross tabulations of the outcomes by the
nine sociodemographic covariates under consideration are not
presented here but are available upon request.)
Figure 1 illustrates that first had opportunity and first used
cocaine cluster within neighbourhoods; it displays within
neighbourhood PWORs and their 95% confidence limits for
six years of data. For each outcome, five of the six PWORs are
greater than unity. The extent to which first had opportunity
clusters within neighbourhoods ranges from 1.20 (95%
CI = 1.00 to 1.44) in 1990 to 1.69 (95% CI = 1.35 to 2.12) in
1993. (The unadjusted counterpart PWORs (not depicted) are
1.20 in 1990 and 1.88 in 1993.) The estimates for first used
cocaine range from 1.30 (95% CI = 1.01 to 1.66) in 1990 to
1.92 (95% CI = 1.29 to 2.86) in 1979. (The unadjusted
counterpart PWORs (not depicted) are 1.42 in 1990 and
2.38 in 1979.)
Figure 2 illustrates both outcomes cluster within cities. It
displays the within city PWORs, and their 95% confidence
limits, from the same models used to estimate the within
neighbourhood PWORs in figure 1. Recall that the within city
PWOR quantifies the residual clustering within cities once
clustering within neighbourhoods has been taken into
account. For each outcome, four of the six PWORs are
greater than unity. The extent to which first had opportunity
clusters within cities ranges from 1.00 (95% CI = 0.99 to 1.01)

unadjusted counterpart PWORs (not depicted) are 1.01 in
1990 and 1.22 in 1979.) The estimates for first used cocaine
range from 0.99 (95% CI = 0.97 to 1.01) in 1990 to 1.29 (95%
CI = 1.08 to 1.53) in 1979. (The unadjusted counterpart
PWORs (not depicted) are 1.00 in 1990 and 1.32 in 1979.) For
both outcomes, within city clustering decreases from 1979 to
a minimum in 1990 and increases thereafter.
Figure 3 illustrates within neighbourhood clustering of
first had opportunity increases with neighbourhood poverty
level in 1992 (z = 2.97) but not in 1993 (z = 0.68). In 1992,
within neighbourhood clustering ranges from 1.16 (95%
CI = 0.91 to 1.47) in the least impoverished neighbourhoods
to 1.94 (95% CI = 1.54 to 2.46) in the most impoverished.
(The unadjusted counterpart PWORs (not depicted) are 1.24
and 2.17, respectively.) Between the two extremes of poverty,
within neighbourhood clustering of first opportunity
increases with increasing poverty rate. In 1993, clustering
ranges from 1.54 (95% CI = 1.17 to 2.01) in the least
impoverished neighbourhoods to 1.79 (95% CI = 1.45 to
2.22) in the most impoverished. (The unadjusted counterpart
PWORs (not depicted) are 1.93 and 1.80, respectively.) In
1993, a gradient effect is precluded by a high degree of
clustering in neighbourhoods with 2.66% to 5.12% poverty
(PWOR = 1.75; 95% CI = 1.07 to 2.86).
Figure 4 illustrates within neighbourhood clustering of
first used cocaine increases with neighbourhood poverty level
in 1992 (at z = 1.92) but not in 1993 (z = 0.55). In 1992, first
use is least clustered in the least impoverished neighbour-
hoods (PWOR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.39 to 1.14) and most
clustered in the most impoverished neighbourhoods
(PWOR = 2.08; 95% CI = 1.34 to 3.24). (The unadjusted
counterpart PWORs (not depicted) are 0.62 and 2.40,
respectively.) Between the two extremes of poverty, within
neighbourhood clustering of first use increases with increas-
ing poverty rate. In 1993, the estimates do not display a
gradient; first cocaine use is least clustered in neighbour-
hoods with 5.13% to 9.02% poverty (PWOR = 1.05; 95%
CI = 0.60 to 1.82) and most clustered in neighbourhoods with
9.03% to 16.15% poverty (PWOR = 1.65; 95% CI = 0.99 to
2.75). (The unadjusted counterpart PWORs (not depicted)
are 1.19 and 1.63, respectively.)
DISCUSSION
This study outlines the use of the pairwise odds ratio to
measure a different kind of contextual effect: the extent to
which a binary outcome clusters geographically. It presents
the first quantitative estimates of the magnitude of spatial
correlation of incident experience with cocaine at two levels
of analysis, neighbourhoods and cities, and by level of
neighbourhood disadvantage. The findings are replicated
using six separate years of survey data collected during the
downward turn in the most recent US cocaine epidemic. First
opportunity to use cocaine co-occurs within neighbourhoods
from 1.2 to 1.7 times more often than one would expect if it
were distributed randomly across neighbourhoods, and first
use of cocaine co-occurs from 1.3 to 1.9 times more often.
Once within neighbourhood concentration has been taken
into account, there is evidence of modest residual clustering
of incident experience with cocaine within cities.
Furthermore, there is some evidence that spatial correlation
of first opportunity to use cocaine and first cocaine use
increase with neighbourhood poverty level. Neighbourhood
composition with respect to age, race/ethnicity, sex, socio-
economic status, and residential mobility does not explain
the spatial correlation of incident experience with cocaine
within neighbourhoods in general, or within poorer neigh-
bourhoods in particular.
One possible explanation for geographical clustering of
cocaine incidence within neighbourhoods is ``contagion'': a
contextual effect in which the probability that a person will
develop a disease outcome is dependent upon the degree to
which others in the community already have the outcome.7 40
In other words, the rate at which unaffected people become
affected (that is, incidence) depends upon the prevalence rate
of disease within a group.41 Despite its connotation, the
contagion effect can describe non-infectious diseases and the
adoption of health behaviours within groups.7 42 For example,
current drug users might encourage use among non-users in
the community and thereby transmit the behaviour and
increase the incidence and prevalence rates.42 In other words,
beliefs and behaviours are transmitted from neighbour to
neighbour.43 44 DeAlarcon reported how heroin use spread in
such a fashion among residents of a London suburb in the
1960s.45 Hughes and Crawford used this model in an attempt
to intervene in Chicago's heroin epidemic of the early 1970s.46
Another possible explanation for clustering of first cocaine
experience within neighbourhoods involves ``selection'' pro-
cesses, selective in-migration and/or out-migration from
neighbourhoods. This study adjusted for selection effects by
incorporating a measure of residential mobility as a covariate.
However, it is important to distinguish selection processes
which produce poverty from the social processes by which

neighbourhood contexts produce spatially clustered out-
comes.47 Elsewhere, we found no evidence of differences in
geographical clustering of cocaine when it was estimated
separately by the residential mobility status of respondents.48
Limitations
A thorough interpretation of the estimates presented herein
necessitates a brief discussion of several limitations of the
data and methods used. The NHSDA data are self reported
and their validity are affected by respondents' truthfulness
and memory, and possibly by socially desirable responding
with respect to the behaviour in question.49 Although NHSDA
procedures encourage honesty and recall, the data are likely
to contain some measurement error.
The use of NHSDA ``segments'' as a proxy for ``neighbour-
hoods'' presents some conceptual difficulties. The ideal
measurement of neighbourhoods would not rely solely on
geographical boundaries but would instead capture the social
dimensions of neighbourhoods, such as cohesion and shared
institutions and values, which have been called ``the ultimate
mechanisms through which neighbourhood effects can be
transmitted.''47 The small size of NHSDA segments (max-
imum of 1000 occupied housing units) makes them a less
problematic stand-in for neighbourhoods than such com-
monly used constructs as census tracts, but their small size is
no guarantee that they somehow embody the interpersonal
connections one wishes to quantify when speaking of
``neighbourhood effects.''44 The same conceptual problem
exists when equating NHSDA primary sampling units with
``cities.''
Future research
One facet of the utility of examining whether within
neighbourhood clustering of first experience with cocaine (or
other drug use or other inherently social health problems)
varies by neighbourhood context rests in its potential for
identifying types of neighbourhoods to target for preventive
intervention. However, it is perhaps too broad a general-
isation, or too simplistic, to suggest that preventive
interventions should be targeted to impoverished neigh-
bourhoods. The cross sectional survey data examined here
cannot speak to the underlying mechanisms that might
give rise to the observed spatial correlation of first
experience with cocaine within neighbourhoods. Future
research should apply and evaluate strategies designed to
uncover the social mechanisms that drive the geographical
clustering of cocaine and other drug use, such as those
proposed by Frohlich et al50 and Macintyre et al.51
Several historical examples drawn from the 20th century
experience in the US suggest that the use of cocaine, or ``club
drugs'' such as MDMA (``ecstasy''), may occur more often in
the upper socioeconomic strata when they first gain
popularity but then drift downward as the epidemic gains
momentum. Hence, the ``tipping point'' described by Crane52
might actually characterise the end stages of epidemics of
social problems. It is possible that in the earlier stages of an
epidemic the poverty gradient in clustering of first cocaine
experience might be inverted, such that clustering is highest
in affluent neighbourhoods and lowest in impoverished
neighbourhoods. This speculation cannot be investigated
with respect to the recent US cocaine epidemic because the
requisite data are not available. The early warning signs of a
cocaine epidemic in Britain17­19 suggest a potential opportu-
nity to examine the plausibility of this hypothesis.
Inclusion of more specific survey questions regarding
experience with cocaine and other drugs would be useful.
For example, survey questions that ask respondents whether
they shared or sold drugs to their neighbours could help
evaluate the plausibility of the contagion interpretation of
geographical clustering of incident drug outcomes.
Furthermore, the NHSDA asks when first experience with
cocaine and other drugs occurred, but not where; knowing
whether it occurred at home, school, work, or outside the
neighbourhood would be essential in any attempt to discern
the mechanisms driving geographical clustering.
Finally, although we conducted a preliminary evaluation,48
more definitive research into the potential effect of incorpor-
ating sampling weights into the estimation of geographical
clustering is necessary. Similarly, it is unknown whether
survey designs that include geographically defined oversamples,
such as the 1991­1993 NHSDA six city oversample, affect
estimates of spatial correlation.
Conclusions
The results of this study concur with recent theories of
concentrated disadvantage. William Julius Wilson demon-
strated that the social transformation of inner city neigh-
bourhoods during the 1970s and 1980s resulted in an
increasing concentration of poverty.53 This concentration of
the most disadvantaged segments of the population produces
what he calls ``concentration effects'': ``the constraints and
opportunities associated with living in a neighbourhood in
which the population is overwhelmingly socially disadvan-
taged--constraints and opportunities that include the kinds
Key points
N The pairwise odds ratio (PWOR) can be used to
quantify the extent to which a binary outcome clusters
geographically. The PWOR can be estimated by the
statistical method of alternating logistic regressions.
N First opportunity to use cocaine and first use of cocaine
cluster within US neighbourhoods to an extent that is
not explained by neighbourhood composition.
N Once spatial correlation within neighbourhoods of
these two incident outcomes has been accounted for,
there is modest residual spatial correlation within US
cities.
N There is some evidence that the spatial correlation of
these outcomes within neighbourhoods increases with
neighbourhood poverty level.
Policy implications
N Geographical clustering of the earliest stages of
involvement with cocaine suggests prevention efforts
might be more effective if they were geographically
targeted.
N In the later stages of a cocaine epidemic, the effect of
prevention efforts might be increased if they were
targeted to disadvantaged neighbourhoods.
N Based on previous experience with cocaine and other
drugs, it is possible that in the earlier stages of an
epidemic the poverty gradient in clustering of first
experience with a drug might be inverted, such that
clustering is highest in affluent neighbourhoods and
lowest in impoverished neighbourhoods. The early
warning signs of a cocaine epidemic in Britain suggest
a potential opportunity to examine the plausibility of
this hypothesis.

of ecological niches that the residents of these communities
occupy in terms of access to jobs, availability of marriageable
partners, and exposure to conventional role models'' (page
144). He also describes the growth of the inner city illicit drug
industry as a concentration effect, which, in turn, can
increase rates of drug use in high poverty neighbourhoods.54
Work inspired by Wilson suggests that both poverty and
affluence are highly geographically concentrated in the
United States.34 55 Furthermore, Massey discussed increasing
rates of drug use as a potential ramification of the
concentration of affluence and poverty.55
One of the more intriguing findings in this study, which
might be added to the body of evidence on concentration
effects, involves the interplay between the geographical
clustering of first experience with cocaine and neighbour-
hood disadvantage. Because the results encompass both first
opportunity to use cocaine and first use of cocaine, one can be
more certain that the spatial correlation of first opportunity
to use, one of the earliest points in the progression through
drug involvement, is engendered by concentrated disadvan-
tage or associated conditions in the neighbourhood environ-
ment. It is not easy to imagine how clusters of opportunity to
try cocaine could cause neighbourhood residents to become
more impoverished in any direct manner. Rather, it seems
more likely that concentrated neighbourhood disadvantage
itself, or characteristics associated with it such as a lack of
social capital56 or collective efficacy,57 might give rise to
conditions that favour the occurrence of a first experience
with cocaine.

APPENDIX
Whereas an ordinary odds ratio is defined in terms of
subjects, the PWOR is defined in terms of all possible pairs of
subjects. It can be defined using a standard two by two table:
Note that the cells of the above table refer to pairs of
subjects, not single subjects, with respect to their values on
an outcome of interest. Pairs concordant on the outcome are
counted in cells A and D. Discordant pairs are evenly split
between cells B and C; the PWOR therefore considers
combinations, but not permutations, of the outcome among
pairs of subjects.
The PWOR is calculated like an ordinary odds ratio by
taking the cross product ratio (AD/BC).58 As its name implies,
the PWOR is the ratio of two odds. The numerator of the ratio
represents the odds that one respondent in the pair has the
outcome when the other respondent has the outcome (A/C).
The denominator represents the odds that one respondent
has the outcome when the other does not have the outcome
(B/D).
The PWOR measures the extent to which an outcome
clusters among respondents within pre-defined geographical
areas and can range from zero to infinity. A value of one is
consistent with an absence of spatial correlation of the
outcome. A PWOR greater than one indicates how many
times more often the outcome co-occurs among respondents
compared with what one would expect if the outcome
occurred randomly. The PWOR, however, is not merely a
function of prevalence or incidence rates. Areas with a lower
rate of disease than others could have a higher degree of
clustering. For example, although typhoid rates are higher in
less industrialised nations where it is endemic, it is more
geographically clustered in industrialised nations because it
occurs as sporadic localised outbreaks. A PWOR indicating no
geographical clustering, on the other hand, does not indicate
the rate of disease is the same for all areas.
ALTERNATING LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS (ALR)
The utility of the PWOR becomes more apparent when it is
used to compare different groups of subjects. The scenario
above considers all possible pairs of subjects without
reference to any intrinsic differences between them. The
method of alternating logistic regressions can estimate the
PWOR across categories of subjects defined in various ways.
The design of the NHSDA allows one to partition subjects on
the basis of geographical units. One way this study defines
subjects is according their geographical residence--neigh-
bourhoods and cities. Another way is by the poverty level of
the neighbourhood in which a subject resides.
I NESTED MODEL
Let Yijk
denote the presence or absence of a cocaine
outcome for the kth respondent in the jth neighbourhood in
the ith city. The log PWOR regression model, or ``pairwise''
model, is written:
where Zijk,m
= 1 if j = , (that is, respondents k and m reside
in the same neighbourhood) and Zijk,m
= 0 otherwise. For
example, in the case of pair (Y111
, Y112
),
because the pair (k = 1 and k = 2) reside in the same city
(i = 1) and neighbourhood (j = 1). However, in the case of
pair (Y121
, Y113
),
because the pair (k = 1 and k = 3) reside in the same city
(i = 1) but different neighbourhoods (j = 2 and j = 1,
respectively). It follows that exp(a0
) is the within city
PWOR and exp(a0
+a1
) is the within neighbourhood PWOR.
The within neighbourhood PWOR estimates the odds of a
cocaine outcome for a respondent from a neighbourhood
where a randomly chosen respondent from the same
neighbourhood has the same outcome relative to the odds
if that respondent does not have the same outcome.58 It
quantifies, in other words, how often a cocaine outcome co-
occurs within neighbourhoods relative to what one would
expect if it were distributed randomly. The within city PWOR
estimates the odds of a cocaine outcome for a respondent
from a city where another randomly chosen respondent from
the same city but different neighbourhood has the same outcome
relative to the odds if the randomly chosen respondent does
not have the same outcome. In other words, it quantifies how
often a cocaine outcome co-occurs within cities relative to
what one would expect if it were distributed randomly,

regardless of any non-randomness within neighbourhoods.
Because it considers pairs of respondents from the same city
but different neighbourhoods, the within city PWOR reflects
the residual clustering of the outcome within cities after
accounting for clustering within neighbourhoods.
Let X*ijk
denote the value of covariate X*
for the kth
respondent in the jth neighbourhood in the ith city. The ALR
model simultaneously estimates a GEE logistic regression of a
cocaine outcome on covariates:
As in a conventional logistic regression, exp(b) is interpreted
as an odds ratio. The inclusion of a covariate that describes
respondents and is associated with the outcome will increase
or decrease the within city or within neighbourhood PWOR,
depending on the direction of the correlation of the covariate
within cities and/or neighbourhoods.58
The ALR algorithm alternates between the logistic model of
the outcome and the log odds ratio regression of the pairwise
associations until convergence.38 The impact of adding
covariates to the logistic model can be gauged by comparing
the unadjusted and adjusted estimates of the PWOR.59 The
inclusion of covariates in the logistic model can be
interpreted as adjusting the within neighbourhood PWOR
for the composition of neighbourhoods with respect to those
covariates. The ALR method is implemented as an S-Plus
(Insightful Corporation S-Plus, version 3.4) function that
estimates the regression coefficients and covariance
matrices from the pairwise and logistic models (Carey VJ,
ALR, version 4D, http://www.biostat.harvard.edu/~carey/
old_public_html/index.ssoff.html).
As the ALR method has not yet been augmented to
incorporate sampling weights, we evaluated their impact on
the estimated PWORs by partitioning the NHSDA samples
based on quartile of sampling weight and re-estimating
selected models. The estimates did not vary in a consistent
manner with quartile of sampling weight.48
II Contextual model
Let Yijk
be a binary variable that represents the presence or
absence of a cocaine outcome for the kth respondent in the ith
neighbourhood of type j. To examine clustering within
neighbourhoods of different types, we write the pairwise
model as:
where Zijk,m
= 1 if j = , (k & m reside in the same
neighbourhood, which is of type j) and Zijk,m
= 0 otherwise.
It follows that exp(a0
) is the PWOR for the reference type of
neighbourhood and exp(a0
+aj
) is the PWOR within neigh-
bourhood type j. The logistic model is specified in the same
manner as in the nested model. For each outcome and year,
we use the contextual ALR model to estimate within
neighbourhood clustering by neighbourhood poverty level
and test the PWORs for trend.
