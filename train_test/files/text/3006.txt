OBSERVATIONAL EPIDEMIO-
logic studies have repeat-
edly identified an indepen-
dent, positive relationship
between dietary intake of sodium and
blood pressure across populations as
well as within populations.1-4 Random-
ized controlled trials have also demon-
strated that reduced sodium intake leads
to a reduction in blood pressure in both
hypertensive and normotensive per-
sons.1,5-7 Given that blood pressure level
is a strong risk factor for coronary heart
disease and stroke, a high dietary so-
dium intake could be predicted to in-
crease the risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease. Indeed, several ecological studies
have found a positive relationship be-
tween average population dietary so-
dium intake and mortality due to
stroke.8-11 Animal studies have also in-
dicated that a high-sodium diet in-
creases stroke mortality in Dahl rats and
stroke-prone spontaneously hyperten-
sive rats.12,13 However, several prospec-
tive cohort studies have failed to iden-
tify a significant association between
dietary sodium intake and risk of
stroke.14,15 This may have been due to
difficulties in measuring an individu-
al's usual sodium intake or to use of rela-
tively small sample sizes.14,15
In westernized populations, intra-
individual variations in sodium intake
are even greater than interindividual
variations.16 This measurement error di-
minishes the statistical power to detect
significant associations between di-
etary sodium intake and cardiovascu-
lar outcomes in epidemiologic studies.
Another difficulty in studying the rela-
tionshipbetweensodiumintakeandcar-
diovascular disease is the heterogene-
ity of risk that exists at any given level
of sodium intake because of the multi-
factorialnatureofenvironmentalandge-
netic influences on risk. For example,
results of some epidemiologic and clini-
calstudiessuggestthatobesepersonsare
more sensitive to the effect of sodium on
blood pressure than are their nonobese
counterparts.17-19 This enhanced so-
dium sensitivity may be due to in-

Context Dietary sodium is positively associated with blood pressure, and ecological
and animal studies both have suggested that high dietary sodium intake increases stroke
mortality.
Objective To examine the risk of cardiovascular disease associated with dietary so-
dium intake in overweight and nonoverweight persons.
Design Prospective cohort study.
Setting The first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic
Follow-up Study, conducted in 1982-1984, 1986, 1987, and 1992.
Participants Of those aged 25 to 74 years when the survey was conducted in 1971-
1975 (14 407 participants), a total of 2688 overweight and 6797 nonoverweight per-
sons were included in the analysis.
Main Outcome Measures Dietary sodium and energy intake were estimated at
baseline using a single 24-hour dietary recall method. Incidence and mortality data
for cardiovascular disease were obtained from medical records and death certificates.
Results For overweight and nonoverweight persons, over an average of 19 years of
follow-up, the total number of documented cases were as follows: 680 stroke events
(210 fatal), 1727 coronary heart disease events (614 fatal), 895 cardiovascular dis-
ease deaths, and 2486 deaths from all causes. Among overweight persons with an
average energy intake of 7452 kJ, a 100 mmol higher sodium intake was associated
with a 32% increase (relative risk [RR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-
1.64; P = .01) in stroke incidence, 89% increase (RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.31-2.74; P.001)
in stroke mortality, 44% increase (RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.14-1.81; P = .002) in coro-
nary heart disease mortality, 61% increase (RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.32-1.96; P.001) in
cardiovascular disease mortality, and 39% increase (RR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.23-1.58;
P.001) in mortality from all causes. Dietary sodium intake was not significantly as-
sociated with cardiovascular disease risk in nonoverweight persons.
Conclusions Our analysis indicates that high sodium intake is strongly and inde-
pendently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mor-
tality in overweight persons.

dium in obese persons.20 We made use
of the large sample size and prolonged
follow-up experiences of participants in
the first National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES I) Epi-
demiologic Follow-up Study to exam-
ine the risk of cardiovascular disease as-
sociated with dietary sodium intake in
overweight persons.
METHODS
Study Population
In NHANES I, a multistage, stratified,
probability-samplingdesignwasusedto
select a representative sample of the US
civilian noninstitutionalized popula-
tionaged1to74years.21,22 Certainpopu-
lation subgroups, including those with
lowincomes,womenofchildbearingage
(25-44 years), and elderly persons (65
years or older) were oversampled. The
NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up
Study is a prospective cohort study of
NHANES I participants who were 25 to
74yearsofagewhenthesurveywascon-
ductedin1971to1975.12-17 Ofthe14407
persons in this age range at baseline, we
excluded 3059 who lacked 24-hour
dietaryrecallinformation;2wholacked
sodium intake information; 1133 who
hadaself-reportedhistoryofheartattack,

used medication for heart disease dur-
ingthepreceding6months;and337who
were consuming a low-salt diet at base-
line.Amongremainingparticipants,391
(4.0%) were lost to follow-up, leaving a
total of 9485 participants, of whom 931
men and 1757 women were over-
weight (TABLE 1). Overweight was
defined as a body mass index of 27.8
kg/m2 or higher for men and 27.3 kg/m2
orhigherforwomen;nonoverweightwas
definedasabodymassindexoflessthan
27.8 kg/m2 for men and less than 27.3
kg/m2 for women.23
Measurements
Baseline data collection included medi-
cal history, standardized medical ex-
amination, dietary history, laboratory
tests, and anthropometric measure-
ments.21,22 A single 24-hour dietary re-
call was conducted by trained NHANES
I personnel using a standardized proto-
col and 3-dimensional food-portion
models. Frequency but not amount of
salt added during food preparation or
consumption was collected in the
NHANES I. The dietary recall question-
naires were later coded by interviewers
using nutrient information from the US
Department of Agriculture Handbook
No. 824 or other resources. Dietary so-
dium and energy intake were calcu-
lated for each participant by the Na-
tionalCenterforHealthStatistics.Frozen
serum samples were sent to the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Preven-
tionformeasurementofserumtotalcho-
lesterol levels. Blood pressure, body
weight, and height were obtained us-
ing standard protocols. The baseline
questionnaire on medical history in-
cluded questions about selected health
conditions and medications used for
those conditions during the preceding
6 months. Data on education, physical
activity, and alcohol consumption were
obtained by interviewer-administered
questionnaires. Baseline information on
smoking status was obtained in a ran-
dom subsample of 936 overweight and
2313 nonoverweight participants who
underwent more detailed baseline ex-
amination.21,22 For the remaining study
participants, information on smoking
status at baseline was derived from re-
sponses to questions on lifetime smok-
ing history at follow-up interviews in
1982 through 1984 or later.25,26 Valid-
ityofinformationobtainedusingthisap-
proach has been documented.25,26
Follow-up Procedures

Incident stroke was based on death
certificate reports in which the under-
lying cause of death was recorded using
an International Classification of Dis-
eases,NinthRevision(ICD-9)codeof430-
434.9, 436, or 437.0-437.1, or 1 or more
hospital and/or nursing home stays in

ICD-9 410-414, or by 1 or more hospi-
tal and/or nursing home stays in which
the participant had a discharge diagno-
sis with an ICD-9 code of 410-414.
Cause-specific mortality was identified
by underlying cause of death using the
following ICD-9 codes: 430-434.9, 436,
or 437.0-437.1 (stroke); 410-414 (coro-
nary heart disease); and 410-414, 430-
434.9,436,437.0-437.1,402-404,or428
(cardiovascular disease). The date of
record for incident events was identi-
fied by the date of first hospital admis-
sion with an established study event or
date of death from a study event in the
absence of hospital or nursing home
documentation of such an event.
Statistical Analysis
Sodium intake and total energy intake
werehighlycorrelatedinthestudypopu-
lation(r = 0.65,P.001).Therefore,both
absolutesodiumintake(mmol/d)andso-
dium-to-energy ratio (mmol/kJ) were
used to examine the relationship be-
tween sodium intake and cardiovascu-
lar disease risk. Relative risk estimates
were similar for both indexes. Sodium-
to-energy ratio was expressed as 1 mmol
of sodium per 7452 kJ, the average en-
ergy intake in the study population.
Because a statistically significant in-
teraction on cardiovascular disease out-
comes was detected between dietary so-
diumintakeandoverweight,allanalyses
were stratified by overweight. The quar-
tile of sodium-to-energy ratio was cal-

647 coronary heart disease events (214
fatal),329cardiovasculardiseasedeaths,
and 810 deaths from all causes were
documented. The cumulative mortal-
ity of stroke at age 85 years was 9.0%,
8.9%, 14.4% and 15.8% among pa-
tients within the first, second, third, and
fourth quartiles of sodium-to-energy ra-
tio, respectively (P = .004 for trend)
(FIGURE). The corresponding cumula-
tive estimates by quartile of sodium-to-
energy ratio were 24.9%, 22.3%, 26.0%,
and 30.9% for coronary heart disease
mortality (P = .17 for trend); 34.3%,
32.4%, 39.0%, and 44.9% for cardiovas-
cular disease mortality (P = .008 for
trend); and 65.8%, 63.7%, 70.2%, and
74.7% for mortality from all causes
(P = .003fortrend),respectively.Thecu-
mulative incidence of stroke at age 85
years was 23.7%, 30.4%, 41.4%, and
33.9% among patients within the first,
second, third, and fourth quartiles of so-
dium-to-energy ratio, respectively
(P = .005 for trend). The cumulative in-
cidenceofcoronaryheartdiseasewasnot
significantly associated with the corre-
sponding sodium-to-energy ratio.
There were statistically significant in-
teractions on major outcomes between
sodiumintakeandoverweight(TABLE 3).
Dietary sodium intake was significantly
associated with increased stroke inci-
dence and mortality from stroke, coro-
nary heart disease, cardiovascular dis-
ease,andallcausesinoverweightbutnot
in nonoverweight persons. Further-
more, the RRs were similar when either
sodium-to-energy ratio or absolute so-
dium intake was used as the indepen-
dent variable.
The association between sodium in-
take and risk of cardiovascular disease
was similar in men and women (P value
for interaction varied from .19 to .98).
For example, a 100-mmol per 7452 kJ
higher intake of sodium was associ-
ated with a 67% increase (RR, 1.67; 95%
CI, 1.27-2.18) in cardiovascular mor-
tality in men and a 53% increase (RR,
1.53; 95% CI, 1.13-2.08) in women
(P = .69 for interaction). A 100-mmol
per 7452 kJ higher intake of sodium was
associated with a 44% increase (RR,
1.44; 95% CI, 1.14-1.81) in all-cause
mortality in men and a 35% increase
(RR, 1.35;95%CI,1.13-1.62)inwomen

COMMENT
Our study is the first to document the
presence of a positive and independent
relationshipbetweendietarysodiumin-
take and cardiovascular disease risk in
adults.In1995,anestimated960 592US
residentsdiedofcardiovasculardisease,
representing 41.5% of all deaths.36 In
many economically developing coun-
tries,cardiovasculardiseasemortalityhas
increased rapidly and has become the
leadingcauseofdeath.37 Dietarysodium
reduction has been recommended as a
meanstopreventbothhypertensionand
cardiovascular disease mortality and
morbidity.38,39 Ourfindingssuggestthat
reducedsodiumintakemaybeespecially
efficacious in overweight persons.
Obesityactivatesthesympatheticner-
vous and renin-angiotensin systems,
causes insulin resistance and hyperin-
sulinemia, and alters intrarenal vascu-
lar resistance. These changes have been
relatedtoenhancedrenaltubularsodium
reabsorption and sodium retention.20,40
In a study of 60 obese and 18 nonobese
adolescents, Rocchini et al18 found that
bloodpressurewasmorereadilyaffected
by dietary sodium intake in obese than
nonobeseadolescents,andthisincreased
sodium sensitivity was reduced after
weight loss. Increased sodium sensitiv-
ity in overweight persons may explain
why we identified a strong, indepen-
dentrelationshipbetweendietarysodium
intake and cardiovascular disease risk,
whereas other investigators who have
studied predominantly nonoverweight
populationshavenotfoundsuchanasso-
ciation.14,15 Overweightisacommonand
importantcardiovasculardiseaseriskfac-
tor.AccordingtodatafromNHANESIII,
conducted from 1988 to 1991, 33.4% of
US adults aged 20 years or older were
overweight as defined by a body mass
index of 27.8 kg/m2 or higher for men
and 27.3 kg/m2 or higher for women.41
That the prevalence of obesity has
increased progressively during recent
decadesinmalesandfemalesofallracial
groups in the United States is particu-
larly troubling.41 To reduce the cardio-
vascular disease risk in overweight
patients, both weight loss and sodium
reductionshouldberecommended.For
persons with difficulty losing weight,
greaterattentiontoreductionsinsodium
intake may be appropriate.

Dahl salt-resistant rats that were placed
on high-salt diets compared with those
that were maintained on lower-salt di-
ets, despite similar levels of blood pres-
sure in the 2 groups.42 Findings from
ecological analyses indicating that the
association between sodium intake and
stroke risk was stronger than the cor-
responding relationship between so-
dium intake and blood pressure level
may also imply a direct effect of so-
dium intake on stroke risk.9,11 In our
study, dietary sodium intake was re-
lated to cardiovascular disease risk and
total mortality, independent of base-
line levels of systolic blood pressure.
Moreover, estimated RRs of cardiovas-
cular disease associated with a 100-
mmol greater sodium intake were much
larger than would be expected based on
the corresponding influence on blood
pressure. In clinical trials, a 100-
mmol reduction in dietary sodium in-
take was associated with an average re-
duction in diastolic blood pressure of
1.4 to 2.5 mm Hg.5 This could poten-
tially result in a 15% decrease in stroke
risk.43 Our study estimated that a 100-
mmol difference in dietary sodium in-
take was associated with a 32% in-
crease in stroke risk. The apparent
excess of observed RR of cardiovascu-
lar disease associated with sodium in-
take compared with that expected on
the basis of anticipated blood pressure
increase suggests the possibility of an
independent direct effect of sodium in-
take on cardiovascular disease.
Alderman and colleagues44 used data
from the NHANES I Epidemiologic Fol-
low-up Study to examine the relation-
ship between dietary sodium intake and
mortality from cardiovascular disease
and all causes. In contrast with our find-
ings, they identified an inverse relation-
ship between sodium intake and mor-
tality from cardiovascular disease
(P = .09) and all causes (P.007) and
a positive relationship between sodium-
to-energy ratio and mortality from car-
diovascular disease (P = .006) and all
causes (P.001). However, several
methodological concerns make it diffi-
cult to interpret their findings. For in-
stance, they did not exclude from their
main analysis participants with base-
line histories of cardiovascular disease,
albeit such participants might have been
expected to have changed their dietary
intake of sodium. In addition, they did
not exclude participants who were con-
suming low-sodium diets at baseline.
Acute rheumatic fever, chronic rheu-
matic heart disease, and diseases of the
pulmonary circulation were included as
cardiovascular mortality outcomes, al-
thoughthereisnoobviousbiologicalba-
sis for a relationship betweensodium in-
take and these diseases. Perhaps of
greatest concern is the fact that they in-
cluded sodium intake, energy intake,
and sodium-to-energy ratio as continu-
ous variables in the same multivariate
model. Given that an interaction term
was included in their analysis model, it
is not possible to interpret the main ef-
fect of sodium intake alone on the out-
comes of interest. The inconsistency of
theassociationbetweenthe2sodiumin-
take indicators (sodium alone and so-
dium-to-energy ratio) and outcomes of
interest in the study by Alderman et al
mightreflecttheheterogeneityofthisre-
lationshipinastudypopulationwithdif-
ferent body weights. In our analyses, we
found a consistent relationship be-
tween both sodium intake and sodium-
to-energy ratio with risk of cardiovas-
cular disease and total mortality in
overweight persons but not in nonover-
weight persons.
In an earlier study, Alderman and col-
leagues45 reported a significant inverse
association between urinary sodium ex-
cretion and incidence of myocardial in-
farction in a prospective study of 2937
patients treated for hypertension. Un-
measured variables and imprecision of
thepotentiallyconfoundingvariablesthat
were measured might have contributed
to the occurrence of this unexpected
finding.46,47 In addition, urinary so-
dium excretion was measured after 5
daysofdietarysodiumrestriction,which
most likely would not have provided a
valid assessment of habitual intake of di-
etarysodium.Finally,thestudywascon-
ductedinhypertensivepatientswhowere
enrolled in a work-site treatment pro-
gram.Assuch,thefindingsmaynothave
general applicability. In our study, di-
etary sodium intake was not associated
withcoronaryheartdiseaseincidencebut
with increased coronary heart disease
mortality. Similarly, analyses from the
Multiple Risk Factors Intervention Trial
cohort did not find an inverse associa-
tion between sodium intake and inci-
dence of myocardial infarction.48
A limitation of our study is the esti-
mation of sodium intake by a single
24-hour dietary recall. This may result
in misclassification of usual sodium
intake at the individual level. In addi-
tion, the dietary recall method used in
NHANES I may have underestimated
sodiumintakebecauseitdidnotinclude
quantitativedataondiscretionaryuseof
salt in the cooking or seasoning of food
at the table, settings that account for
about 15% to 30% of the sodium intake
in Western societies.49,50 Likewise,
NHANES I study participants may have
underreported their dietary energy
intake.51,52 These measurement errors
would tend to bias our RR estimates
toward1(effectto0)inunivariatemod-
els.Asidefromapossibleloweringofsen-
sitivity to sodium intake in nonover-
weight compared with overweight
persons, these measurement errors in
sodium intake might have contributed
to our finding of a null association in
nonoverweight persons. Another limi-
tationisthatparticipantswerepassively
followedupforclinicaloutcomes.How-
ever,anyresultantmisclassificationbias
is likely to have been confined to char-
acterizationofincidentcasesandshould
havehadnoeffectonestimationofmor-
tality experience.
Our study has several important
strengths. First, the findings can be gen-
eralized to overweight persons in the
US general population because the
NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up
Study cohort is a random sample of this
population. In addition, temporal rela-
tionships can be established with con-
fidence because dietary sodium intake
was measured at baseline, and subse-
quent cardiovascular disease and total
mortality were assessed over an aver-
age of 19 years. The fact that follow-up
experience was available for more than

96% of study participants further en-
hances the validity of our findings.
Our study indicates that a high so-
dium intake is strongly and indepen-
dently associated with an increased risk
of cardiovascular disease in over-
weight persons. While we await addi-
tional studies on this important pub-
lic health issue, our findings support
existing recommendations for moder-
ate reduction in sodium intake aimed
at reducing blood pressure and cardio-
vascular disease risk in the over-
weight adult population.
