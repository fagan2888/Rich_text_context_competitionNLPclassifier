Australia, a country intensely populated by migrants from
the 18th century onward,1 is still one of the strongest targets
of migration.2 According to the 2011 Census, almost 6 mil-
lion migrants born in more than 200 countries now live in the
country. While migrants from English-speaking countries
(e.g., the United Kingdom and New Zealand) are still the
largest group of overseas-born residents, 19% of the
Australian population over 5 years of age speaks languages
other than English at home. Almost half (49%) of longer-
standing migrants and 67% of recent arrivals3 speak a lan-
guage other than English at home (Australian Bureau of
Statistics, 2012b). One of the most obvious manifestations of
this process is the presence in the classroom of students
acquiring English as a second language while having to cope
with the academic demands of a new curriculum (Verhoeven,
1991). In some geographical areas (e.g., Logan Central,
Queensland), up to 70% of the state school's population are
fromnon-English-speakinghomes(QueenslandGovernment,
2009). About 30% of these children cannot read or write in
their first language and experience difficulties in the transi-
tion to a new educational system in a language yet to be mas-
tered (Queensland Government, 2009).
While mastery of the English language by migrant chil-
dren is undoubtedly a crucial aim, it is still to be noted that
languages other than English are neglected in the Australian
education system. The lack of institutional support is particu-
larly noteworthy in the area of literacy skills in minority lan-
guages. Parents wishing to raise their children bilingually
have very few venues--other than classes offered by
Community Language Schools in a limited number of lan-
guages--to ensure that their children become literate in their
native language(s), or that they can maintain literacy in the
home language if the process of literacy development has
been interrupted by migration. This affects not only newly
arrived children but also second- and third-generation
migrants as can be seen from high percentages of language
attrition rates (Clyne, 2001; Lo Bianco, 2003). There is
ample research that shows that writing is the most fragile
skill in linguistic minority situations, as it is not needed in
daily life and needs constant use or practice for its mainte-
nance (Clyne, Fernandez, Chen, & Summo-O'Connell,
1997; Oriyama, 2011). Over time, the lack of institutional
support results in what has been termed kitchen languages,
impoverished varieties of community languages that serve
mostly oral communication needs around restricted topics. In
addition, as we show in the next sections, insufficient sup-
port for home languages deprives children of the recognized
educational, social, and affective advantages associated with
bilingualism and can hinder intergenerational cohesion
within families and communities. Moreover, this situation

The Importance of Literacy in the Home
Language: The View From Australia
Susana A. Eisenchlas1, Andrea C. Schalley1, and Diana Guillemin1
Abstract
While advantages of literacy in the home language have been widely documented, the Australian education system has not
been proactive in providing institutional support for its development. This paper investigates the impact of (il)literacy in the
home language on the academic, affective, and social development of bilingual/multilingual children and proposes principles
that home-language-literacy programs should meet to be effective. It discusses programs that, although designed to develop
literacy or second-language proficiency mainly in classroom contexts, could be easily adapted to address the needs of
the linguistically and culturally diverse Australian context. We argue that the cost of not investing in successful home-
language-literacy programs will be higher in the long run than their implementation costs and recommend that Australia
should consider supporting grassroots home-language-literacy programs in a push to improve overall literacy outcomes for
Australian home-language speakers.

entails a loss of potential economic opportunities for the
country, as few people develop the advanced language skills
required to operate successfully in the international arena.
Paradoxically, given Australia's dependence on interna-
tional trade (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2012a)4 and its
often-repeated desire to be accepted as part of the Asia
Pacific group of nations (Goldsmith & Dun, 1997; Keating,
2000; Smith, 2009), the call is made periodically to enhance
the role of languages in the curriculum and improve their
teaching. However, when it comes to public debate and edu-
cational language policy and planning for languages other
than English, there is no clear and consistent conceptualiza-
tion of how these languages are viewed. In a classic article,
Ruiz (1984) discusses three main policy orientations to lan-
guage: language as a right, language as a problem, and lan-
guage as a resource. Although Ruiz was reflecting on the
United States and Canada, this distinction is pertinent to the
Australian context and provides a useful framework for anal-
ysis. In Australia, not all language groups have the opportu-
nity to be included in the school curriculum. When it comes
to languages other than English, a clear distinction is made
between modern foreign languages, indigenous languages,
and migrant/community languages (Lo Bianco, 2003).5 Only
a few "foreign" languages are seen as resources, and, thus,
when it comes to justify the selection of particular languages
in the education system, justifications are worded either in
relation to the high cultural achievements of the target cul-
tures (e.g., French and German) or to economic and geopo-
litical national imperatives (e.g., Chinese and Japanese).
Most of the languages spoken in Australia however are not
seen in this light. Except for the few languages that at differ-
ent times attracted strong financial support from foreign gov-
ernments or institutions (e.g., Korean and Italian), "migrant/
community" languages are seen as a problem, hindering
assimilation into the dominant culture and potentially polar-
izing society. Lo Bianco poignantly summarizes the situation
noting that in Australia, languages spoken "in other coun-
tries" and divorced from daily life are seen as valuable skills.
In contrast, "when the languages are less foreign, when emo-
tional attachment and mastery may be high, their study, pub-
lic use, and maintenance `threaten civilization.' No longer a
skill but sedition" (Lo Bianco, 2000, p. 99). This reflects the
tension that Hakuta and McLaughlin (1996), describing the
situation in the United States, take as evidence of "elite" ver-
sus "folk bilingualism". Bilingualism in Australia has simi-
larly been mostly confined "to a small and in sociological
terms, elite (unrepresentative) category," which learns for-
eign languages from a historically privileged English-
speaking base and to "immigrants and indigenous peoples; a
larger but not socially elite category," who learn English as a
second language from a historically disadvantaged base (Lo
Bianco, 2003, p. 10).
For reasons outlined in the section "Literacy in the Home
Language: What Research Tells Us," recognition and sup-
port for indigenous and migrant/community languages are
crucial to children, families, and the nation. The section
"Minority Language Education in the Australian Context" pro-
vides a brief overview of the minority-language-education situ-
ation in Australia. We conclude that given the substantial
linguistic diversity in Australia, effective support strategies
can only be devised through deployment of innovative
approaches that are mindful of resources. In the section
"Alternative Approaches", we thus discuss a number of such
approaches that might be trialed and put to use in the
Australian home-language context. The "Conclusion" summa-
rizes the paper, recommending thatAustralia should consider to
systematically support grass-root home-language-literacy pro-
grams in a push to improve overall literacy outcomes for a
substantial group of Australians--those who speak a lan-
guage other than English at home.
Before going any further, however, some terminological
clarifications are in order: In this paper, we refer to "majority
language" as the language used by a socially and culturally
dominant group, whereas "minority language" is used by a
group that is subordinate in a social and cultural context
(Hamers & Blanc, 2000).6 With regard to the relationship
between the speaker and the minority language(s), a number
of alternative terms have been used in the literature (among
them "mother tongue", "first language", "home language",
"native language", "heritage language", cf. Skutnabb-
Kangas, 2000), but their definitions are not straightforward.
One of the most commonly used terms is "mother tongue".
This concept has taken a variety of meanings in the literature.
As Olivier (2011) notes, it is difficult to determine which
language used by multilinguals is actually the person's
mother tongue. Skutnabb-Kangas (1988, p. 16-17) proposes
that when trying to determine a speaker's "mother tongue", it
is important to distinguish between four aspects: origin--
which language was acquired first; competence--which lan-
guage the speaker knows the best; function--which language
the speaker uses the most; and identification--which lan-
guage is used to associate with or disassociate from others. It
is evident that a speaker may have more than one mother
tongue and that the mother tongue can change during the
lifetime. Following this definition, it is obvious that the term
first language is insufficient as it only relates to origin, but
the bilinguals' chronological first language may not be their
dominant language. For lack of a better term, and given that
our focus is on young children, in this paper, we use the term
home language as the language acquired by the child through
immersion at home, usually the language the child knows
best before going through child care or school.
Literacy in the Home Language: What
Research Tells Us
It should be pointed out at the outset that our approach is
ideologically based on the belief in the value of multicultur-
alism and in the right of minority groups to choose whether
to retain their language(s) and culture7--in Ruiz's (1984)
Eisenchlas et al. 3
terms, in "language as a right and as a resource". We, there-
fore, focus our discussion on empirical research that has
extensively documented the many educational, social, and
affective advantages of developing literacy in the home
language and, conversely, the detrimental effects of home-
language-literacy neglect.8 The following sections report on
general research findings. However, unlike first-language-
acquisition patterns that typically show consistency in pace
and rate of linguistic development across populations
(Slobin, 1986), bilingual acquisition involves great degrees
of variability and is affected by issues such as quantity and
quality of input, context of acquisition, methods of upbring-
ing (e.g., simultaneous vs. consecutive), and even children's
cultural orientation and identification (Verhoeven, 1991b).
Many of the studies discussed in what follows give little
information about participants and their circumstances, and,
therefore, the findings need to be taken with caution, as they
may conceal nuances or patterns that only apply to particular
contexts. More research in this area is most certainly needed;
nonetheless, results of recent studies as outlined in the fol-
lowing sections appear to point toward manifold advantages
to developing literacy in the home language, including ben-
efits for literacy in general.9
Educational Advantages for the Child
Current research indicates that home-language-literacy
acquisition provides a number of educational advantages to
bilingual children. These include fostering the development
of linguistic skills in the home language to high levels of
proficiency, supporting the acquisition of literacy in the
majority language, easing the transition into the school envi-
ronment, and enhancing the child's general academic
achievement. We briefly discuss each of these issues in turn.
Home-language development and maintenance.Research has
shown that literacy is important for long-lasting lexical
development, fluency, and overall maintenance of a language
(Baker, 2006; Cohen, 1989; Olshtain, 1989). Conversely,
studies conducted mostly in Canada and the United States
have documented the rapid loss of home-language fluency in
the early years of schooling when these languages are not
reinforced (see Cummins, 2005, for a review of studies).
Indeed, language attrition has been reported in the latestAus-
tralian census: First-generation Australians had the highest
proportion of people who spoke a language other than Eng-
lish at home (53%). It was much lower for second-generation
Australians (20%) and lower still for the third-plus genera-
tion (1.6%) (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2012b).
Acquisition of the majority language. Underlying the dominant
monolingual orientation of the Australian education system,
with the consequent disregard for languages other than Eng-
lish, is what Benson (2005) calls the "either-or myth," that is,
the mistaken belief that bilingualism causes confusion and
that it must be pushed aside so that the majority language can
be acquired. Children are thus expected to undergo a rapid
transition into the majority language, which would ensure
academic success and improve their chances of effective
competition in mainstream society. Richardson (1998) very
aptly summarizes the Australian situation: "In the multi-eth-
nic Australian society literacy pedagogy and schooling are
identified as the equalising instruments in an otherwise com-
plex, heterogeneous and unequal society" (p. 128).
Under this perspective, foreign languages spoken by non-
English-speaking immigrants in Australia are seen as a hin-
drance to the assimilation process (Wright & Taylor, 1995).
Migrant and refugee parents, concerned that their children
will lag behind their native-born peers, follow the mistakenly
dispensed advice of shifting into English in their interactions
with their children, despite their limited proficiency in this
language (Martín, 2005).10 These beliefs, however, run coun-
ter to the massive body of research providing evidence that
home-language promotion is possible at no cost to the devel-
opment of the majority language and to the documented ben-
eficial role of bilingualism in general, and of literacy in the
home language in particular, as discussed in the following
paragraph.
With regard to mastery of the majority language, there is
growing acceptance that home-language maintenance not
only supports it (Makin, Campbell, & Jones Diaz, 1995), but
also that children who are educated initially in their home
language learn a second language, and hence the majority
language, more proficiently and achieve more academic suc-
cess than those who have not had such a solid foundation
(Barac & Bialystok, 2011; Cummins, 1999; Cummins, 2000;
Swain, Lapkin, Rowen, & Hart, 1990; Thomas & Collier,
1997). In a report commissioned by the U.S. Department of
Education, August and Shanahan (2010) concluded that
teaching students in their home language was beneficial to
English-literacy learning and better than English immer-
sion.11 Benson (2005) argues that the more highly developed
the first language skills the better the results in the second
language, because language and cognition in the second lan-
guage build on the first. Similarly, Verhoeven (1991) pro-
poses that "[i]t is easier for children to build up elementary
literacy skills in [the language for] which they have acquired
basic phonological, lexical and syntactic skills" (p. 61).12
Studies have shown that strategies involved in reading in
the first language can be positively transferred to the other
language. Swain et al. (1990) explain that the facilitative
effect of home-language-literacy programs stems from the
fact that it is easier for children to develop an initial under-
standing of the functions and mechanics of reading and writ-
ing in the language they use to make sense of their life
experiences. This effect can be found even when two lan-
guages are written differently (Bialystok, Luk, & Kwan,
2005). Studies have also shown that bilingual children have
a more complete understanding of the symbolic relation
between print and meanings than monolinguals. Bialystok
4 SAGE Open
(2001b) found that "just being exposed to two writing sys-
tems, or two kinds of storybooks, enabled bilingual children
to appreciate that the written forms are the symbolic systems
from which the story emerges" (p. 30). This finding is attrib-
uted to the bilingual's experience in managing two writing
systems and the resulting insights about the separation of
form and meaning, a crucial prerequisite skill in the develop-
ment of literacy.
It has also been proposed that, once students have basic
literacy skills in the home language and have developed
communicative abilities in the majority language, they will
be able to transfer the literacy skills acquired in the familiar
language into the new language. The posited transfer of skills
is based on Cummins' (1976, 1979) interdependence theory
and the concept of common underlying proficiency whereby
the knowledge of the home language and the second lan-
guage are not separated but interdependent. Thus, language,
literacy, and concepts learned in the home language can be
accessed and used in the second language, once oral L2 skills
are developed. No relearning of elementary-literacy skills is
required, provided that there is enough exposure and motiva-
tion. There is a proviso, however, that children must achieve
adequate levels of proficiency in both languages for this
transfer to occur. Cummins (1979) calls this proposal the
threshold hypothesis. Thus, reaching adequate levels of pro-
ficiency in the home language is seen as a prerequisite that
leads to positive cognitive and academic consequences for
the bilingual child.13 The relationship between bilingualism
and cognitive/academic outcomes is mediated by the level of
language proficiency, which is, in turn, affected by the acqui-
sition of literacy skills.
This proposal does not exclude the possibility of transfer-
ring the skills acquired in the majority language into the
home language; however, given the arguments discussed
above, when the home language is the dominant one, transfer
from the majority into the home language would be an
unnecessarily difficult and inefficient process (Benson,
2005).
Transition into the school environment.A number of studies
have suggested that minority-language-speaking children
can potentially experience compounding disadvantage when
starting school (Makin et al., 1995; Verhoeven, 1991a). In
the Australian context, children who speak English enter for-
mal schooling already speaking the language in which they
will become literate. Furthermore, they have been social-
ized--through child-care and home practices--into the gen-
eral practices followed at school, are taught by native
speakers of English, and live in a society supportive of Eng-
lish. On the other hand, minority-language speakers often do
not speak the majority language, or not fluently, when they
enter school. They have not been generally socialized into
the norms of interaction of a typical Australian class situa-
tion. Moreover, the teacher does not speak their language,
and they are taught alongside native speakers of English.
These children live in a society that does not support bilin-
gualism and are not able to become literate in their home
language (Makin et al., 1995). This situation, which poten-
tially disadvantages migrant/refugee children, as well as
indigenous minorities, has been addressed in some countries
by creating bilingual and dual literacy programs that roughly
fall into three main educational approaches: simultaneous
bilingual instruction from the start, successive home-
language­majority-language literacy instruction (also called
the "staircase approach"), or successive majority-language­
home-language literacy instruction (Verhoeven, 1991).14 In
these programs, bilingual teachers who share children's lan-
guages and cultures facilitate the transition into the new aca-
demic culture. Such literacy programs would be possible if
the number of languages spoken in society was restricted,
but they would be extremely difficult to implement in multi-
lingual societies such as Australia, given the human and
financial resources needed to implement a project of this
magnitude.
While these programs show very promising results in
terms of children's academic achievement (see for instance
Devlin, 1997, 2005; Gale, McClay, Christie, & Harris, 1981;
Mohanty, 1990) when compared with the typical L2 submer-
sion found in most regions in Australia, they are rare in
Australia. Aboriginal education was an exception with dual-
literacy education being implemented in some states, but
these programs have had a chequered history (Molyneux,
2009).15
General academic achievement.A number of scholars have
proposed that acquisition of literacy in the home language,
whether simultaneously or concurrently with literacy devel-
opment in the majority language, is a source of general cog-
nitive and academic advantages for bilinguals that extend
beyond the linguistic domain (Swain & Lapkin, 1991a, in
Baker, 2006). Domains in which this claim has been tested
include meta-linguistic awareness, phonological awareness,
working memory, ability to decode and interpret text, in par-
ticular, when the writing systems differ across languages,
and enhanced attention and concentration, among other skills
(see Bialystok, 2001a, for a thorough review of the
literature).
It is thus fair to say that there is complementary evidence
pointing to manifold educational advantages to developing
literacy in the home language, with positive effects not only
for literacy acquisition in both home and majority language
but also for academic achievement more generally. We now
turn to affective advantages.
Affective Advantages
There is ample research on the positive affective outcomes
that derive from literacy in the home language. Expanding the
functions and usage of the home language increases the status
of that language, which according to Baker (2006) is crucial
Eisenchlas et al. 5
for language maintenance. Baker further argues that, where
oral communication is in the minority language and literacy in
the majority language, the minority language has lower pres-
tige and may have less chances of being maintained.
Wright and Taylor (1995), who studied the effect of edu-
cation in the home language (i.e., Inuttitut) vis-à-vis educa-
tion in a second language (i.e., English) in Canada, showed
that early home-language education had a positive effect on
the personal and collective self-esteem of minority-language
students, while instruction in the second language did not
have a positive effect. Bialystok (2001a) argues that "the lan-
guage we speak is instrumental in forming our identity, and
being required to speak a language that is not completely
natural may interfere with the child's construction of self" (p.
5) and may impinge on the child's ability in establishing eth-
nic and cultural affiliations. Furthermore, literacy in the
home language enables the home traditions and culture to be
accessed, reproduced, and transmitted (Clyne, 1991;
Fishman, 1991; Oriyama, 2011). It may thus encourage in-
group affiliation, positive self-esteem, the vision and world-
view of one's heritage culture, self-identity, and intellectual
empathy. High self-esteem may result in better performance
in English in the long run. Studies have shown positive cor-
relations between self-esteem and academic success (Makin
et al., 1995; Wright & Taylor, 1995).
Researchers (e.g., Fishman, 1991; Rosenthal & Cichelloa,
1986) have noted that language shift can result in intergen-
erational conflict and alienation triggered by a clash of val-
ues between the newcomers and their offspring, and diminish
feelings of belonging.16 Conversely, allowing children to
develop skills to maintain and expand the home language
and to access the cultural heritage of their parents and grand-
parents may enhance community cohesion and may foster
acceptance and understanding of cultural diversity.
Social Advantages
Supporters of a monolingual agenda often base their argu-
ments on the myth of "one nation­one language," or, in other
terms, in the mistaken belief that monolingualism is a crucial
prerequisite to social cohesion (Hobsbawm, 1996; Lo
Bianco, 2003). They argue that if groups retain their cultures
and languages, they will be less likely to identify with the
mainstream culture and thus will become disengaged from
the society and state.As many have noted, however, minority
language oracy without literacy can disempower students
and lead to language shift and assimilation. Assimilation, in
addition to eliminating cultural richness in society, "can
result in lowered self-esteem, poor self-concept and cultural
alienation" (Olivier, 2011, p. 22), not only from the in-group
but also from the community at large. While the exact mix of
contributing factors is still unclear, Barrett, Sonderegger, and
Sonderegger (2002) have shown that "Australian adolescents
exhibit greater overall self-esteem than young migrants"
(p. 229). They discuss the need for culture-specific
early-intervention and prevention programs. The support of
literacy in the home language could be trialed as a part of
such programs.
Advantages for the Nation
While advanced foreign-language proficiency is seen as a
valuable resource to the nation and as an imperative in the
age of globalization, foreign language studies in Australia
are mostly relegated to the Higher Education level (Clyne,
2005; Martín, 2005). As a result of the late start, very few
learners acquire languages to a level at which they can oper-
ate effectively across languages and cultures. Paradoxically,
children from culturally and linguistically diverse back-
grounds, who could potentially fill Australia's linguistic
needs, are ignored, thus lost to the system. Clyne (2005)
refers to this process as a "squandering" of language
resources. As many of these children shift into the dominant
language, their home language deteriorates to a stage where
only passive comprehension and minimal production skills
are retained (Clyne, 2005; Oriyama, 2011). Cummins (2005)
poignantly characterizes the current situation as a "bizarre
scenario of schools successfully transforming fluent speak-
ers of foreign languages into monolingual English speakers,
at the same time as they struggle, largely unsuccessfully, to
transform English monolingual students into foreign lan-
guage speakers" (p. 586). In light of this, it suggests itself
that fostering the home language and its literacy develop-
ment would not only be hugely beneficial to the children and
families involved but also result in an invaluable gain for the
nation and society as a whole.
Minority Language Education in the
Australian Context
When it comes to providing resources to develop linguistic
skills in general and literacy in particular for minority-
language speakers, Australia faces a number of challenges:
Migrants come from different places, cultures, and socioeco-
nomic and educational backgrounds. While more than 200
languages are regularly spoken in Australia by 19% of the
population over the age of 5 (Australian Bureau of Statistics,
2012b), the second most frequently spoken language after
English is Mandarin, which is spoken by only 4% of the pop-
ulation. This contrasts with the situation in the United States
where 12.3% of the population speaks just one minority lan-
guage, Spanish (Shin & Kominski, 2010), or with Canada
that has an official policy of bilingualism, thus officially
acknowledging a right for children to receive publicly funded
primary and secondary schooling in French or English if
French or English, respectively, is the minority language of
the area they live in (Section 23 of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms; Government of Canada, 1982).17
The wide range of languages spoken makes it difficult
to address the educational needs of this culturally and
6 SAGE Open
linguistically diverse sector of the population. Ideological
and practical considerations further complicate the issue. As
described above, assimilationist policy orientations call into
question the value of diverting resources into supporting
community languages. Even when the political willingness
exists, there are obvious limitations in terms of materials,
curricula, and teaching expertise in such a varied range of
languages, some of which have few speakers.
Experiences overseas leave no doubts that bilingual
school-based programs, in which children are taught part or
the entire curriculum in a second language, would be the
optimal model of biliteracy development, and there is ample
evidence to attest for their effectiveness (Swain et al., 1990;
Willig, 1985). However, and despite the fact that this sort of
schooling was once very common (Clyne, 1991), in contem-
porary Australia, bilingual schools are very rare, as language
proficiency has become synonymous with mastery of
English-language skills (Molyneux, 2009). The few bilin-
gual programs that exist are for target languages that are seen
as "resources" (e.g., French, German, Chinese, Japanese),
but they are ill-equipped in terms of funding and staffing
requirements to cope with the wide range of languages spo-
ken in the community.
Minority language education in Australia has been pre-
dominantly pursued through Community Language Schools
(otherwise called "ethnic," "heritage," "community run
schools," or "Saturday/Sunday" schools). There are at pres-
ent some 1,000 community language schools attended by
about 100,000 school-aged children (Australian Federation
of Ethnic Schools Associations, 2012). These schools pro-
vide language maintenance in 72 languages (Lo Bianco,
2009; Australian Federation of Ethnic Schools Associations,
2012) and receive State funding supplemented by Federal
"per capita" funding.
Most of these schools teach language and culture, some
also add religion and history to instill in-group loyalty. They
would be particularly suitable to develop literacy in the home
languages, an area about which parents may feel less confi-
dent. Despite the good intentions, there are many challenges
these schools face. One of the most problematic aspects is
that tuition is usually carried out in addition to mainstream
schooling, generally on Saturday or Sunday mornings or
after school hours. Many children lack motivation and per-
ceive after-hours school as an unnecessary burden. In addi-
tion, Australian cities are extremely spread out and driving
children to the schools where the target language (i.e., home
language of the child) is offered may be utterly impractical, as it
may, for example, clash with parents' working commitments.
Given the diversity of languages, not every language can be
offered in each city or suburb, and, because all minority-lan-
guage speakers do not live in urban centers, their needs are
not met by community language schools.
Another challenge these programs face, particularly in
small schools, is the vast range in students'linguistic compe-
tence. Catering for this diversity requires a balance between
age/cognitive development and language development in the
class composition. The lack of trained teachers in the differ-
ent target languages and the scarcity of teaching materials
appropriate to the Australian situation pose additional prob-
lems; the available textbooks are usually intended for much
younger children in the country of origin and are, thus,
unlikely to motivate students. Community language schools
thus struggle to cope with their community's linguistic
diversity.
From a broader perspective, there are additional issues
with relying on community language schools for supporting
home-language literacy. Not all parents may have the
resources to provide their children with the opportunity to
attend community language schools. Socioeconomic status
of families is thus likely to preselect who can attend, as are
other factors such as the value that is attributed to bilingual-
ism and biliteracy. Moreover, the languages on offer at the
moment of writing merely represent about one third of the
languages spoken in homes across Australia, that is, about
two thirds of the language communities do not have this ave-
nue at all to support their children's home-language-literacy
development. It is thus crucial to start exploring which alter-
native ways might be available, which we do in the following
sections.
Alternative Approaches
Because we do not anticipate a large-scale policy shift with
respect to home/community languages, and given the high
number of languages to be included in any home-language-
literacy programs across Australia, we propose that alterna-
tive teaching and learning strategies need to be explored to
achieve more immediate impact. In Cummins'(2005) words,
we propose a move away from macropolicies and instead
focus on working with communities and educators at the
local level to implement instructional practices aimed at
strengthening students' home-language literacy and profi-
ciency. As Fishman (1991) points out, overreliance on the
education system leads to a frustrating struggle against the
monolingual mindset. He suggests that parents need to take
more responsibility in bringing up their children in two lan-
guages. Furthermore, as Baker (2006) acknowledges, while
the school is important in developing literacy, bilinguals also
develop literacy in the family and the community, environ-
ments that could very well be exploited for home-language-
literacy development. Learning outside school and using the
minority community's resources help personalize the experi-
ence of reading and writing by relating information to the
child's own experiences and emotions.
We, therefore, propose a bottom­up introduction of literacy
through nonformal education practices. To be successful, these
strategies will need to be implemented as extracurricular activ-
ities, without adding substantial demands on parents and car-
ers' time and resources. They will also require grass-root
community support to persuade different ethno-linguistic
Eisenchlas et al. 7
groups to provide competent native speakers and funds for the
development of appealing and culturally appropriate pedagog-
ical materials so that students will be encouraged to use these
resources--and they need to be easily and cheaply maintained,
updated, and expanded. Benson (2005) argues that this type of
grassroots-level approach, although not easy from a large-
scale organizational standpoint, is the most promising in terms
of community commitment and sustainability.
The initial community investment in developing such
programs will be offset by its potential benefits: In addition
to the positive effects identified in the section "Literacy in
the Home Language: What Research Tells Us", there will be
the added benefit for the diverse ethno-linguistic groups in
raising the usefulness and status of the home language in the
community in the eyes of speakers and nonspeakers, thus
fostering a valorization of the home culture and language and
a sense of pride. This nonformal approach is also expected to
increase parent participation in their children's education and
to foster cultural relevance to the social context of the child,
which some researchers consider essential to the enhance-
ment of children's literacy (Hancock, 2002; Krashen, 2000;
Thomas & Collier, 1998).
Given the complex nature of the Australian context, it
becomes clear that any offerings of home-language-literacy
support to children of minority languages have to meet a
number of principles. From the learners' perspective, these
programs need to be:
i. engaging and motivating, so that children enjoy the
experience and are intellectually stimulated; yet
ii. nonthreatening, to avoid frustration; and
iii. culturally relevant and appropriate, to draw on chil-
dren's immediate experiences.
In terms of design and implementation, these programs
should be:
iv. easily adaptable, to cater to different levels of profi-
ciency, different languages, and different ages;
v. flexibly accessible at different times and locations of
the children's choice;
vi. cost-effective (ideally freely available); and
vii. easy to maintain and expand.
Programs that meet all these conditions should foster
responsibility and autonomy in the learners.
In the remainder of this paper, we describe some approaches
that have been implemented overseas to promote home/
community-language literacy outside of, or parallel to, the
mainstream education system. We, in particular, focus on their
suitability to theAustralian context. While a single approach is
unlikely to work across different cultural contexts and speech
communities and for different ages, developmental stages,
and literacy levels of children, we nonetheless expect that a
sophisticated adaptation and combination of aspects from
these different approaches might lead to an improvement of
home-language-literacy levels in the Australian context. This
overview is by no means exhaustive but is meant to show the
effectiveness of some programs in meeting some (or all) of the
principles listed above. As outlined in the following, the pro-
grams selected either concentrate on motivating young learn-
ers through engaging materials or on involving parents to
assist in the learning process.
The "Book Flood" and "Shared Book"
Approaches
This approach, initially developed in the South Pacific in the
1970s, was used in a number of developing countries to
improve the acquisition of English as a foreign language by
children who have already developed literacy skills in their
home language. The "Book Flood" approach (Elley, 2000)
involves making available in the classroom a "flood" of
about 100 high-interest books that children can access inde-
pendently. The basic hypothesis underlying this approach is
that, if children have an abundant supply of engaging books
in class (principle i), it would increase their exposure to the
language and thus expand their lexical and grammatical
acquisition. Good quality books that appeal to their interests
would also increase reading time and motivation, both good
predictors of academic success. Thus, the books are not seen
as supplementary materials but as the central pedagogical
tools, which allow children to proceed autonomously and
learn the language directly by reading.
Recognizing that not all cultures engage in similar read-
ing practices (conf. Heath, 1982), the "Shared Book"
approach--developed independently of the "Book Flood"--
is used as a preparation step and to avoid early frustration
(principle ii). Here, the teacher shares a good book with a
class of pupils over several days until they become familiar
with the language of the book (Elley, 2000). The teacher
introduces the stories, discusses the title and illustrations,
and encourages children to make predictions about the con-
tent. This builds up children's confidence in their abilities to
work out meanings from illustrations and/or context later on.
The stories are discussed and reread until children are famil-
iar and can join in. The process is meant not only to introduce
children to particular stories but also to ensure that children
interact constructively with books on a daily basis and to
provide modeling and guidance on how to engage with
books, thus preparing children for independent reading.
Programs using these approaches have been evaluated by
Elley and her colleagues in a variety of cultural contexts, lan-
guages, and age levels. The results show that the "Book
Flood" approach can double the rate of reading acquisition,
improve writing, listening comprehension, and related lan-
guage skills, and increase motivation and enthusiasm for
reading. Moreover, students appear to transfer their enhanced
skills to other subjects of the curriculum that depend heavily
on reading (Elley, 2000).
8 SAGE Open
Although the aim of the "Book Flood" approach is to
improve linguistic proficiency in a foreign language, we
believe that this model could be even more effective in pro-
moting literacy in a language in which children are already
fluent. Adapting such a model to the Australian context
would also address one of the criticisms raised against the
original implementation of the "Book Flood", namely, the
lack of cultural relevance and appropriateness (principle iii;
Elley, 2000), given that the approach was based on books
imported from abroad and developed for widely different
cultural contexts. We propose that the community can con-
tribute to the creation of texts and that texts can be shared
within the community, thus also reducing overall costs.
Moreover, members of the community could easily be
trained to assist children in the initial stages of literacy devel-
opment (see the two programs discussed in the section
"Family Literacy Programs"), thus addressing potential
shortages of community teachers fluent in particular lan-
guages. Furthermore, these resources could be digitized and
made freely available online, thus overcoming the scarcity of
resources and obstacles of accessibility.
A recent implementation based on similar principles is
being conducted by Worldreader, a U.S. and European non-
profit organization, who is making digital books written by
foreign and local authors and publishers available to children
in the developing world. As of May 2013, they have distrib-
uted more than 609,000 e-books to 4,300 children in sub-
Saharan Africa. Their initial evaluations, reported on their
website (http://www.worldreader.org), indicate marked
improvements in reading abilities and high levels of engage-
ment. In the Australian context, where children have comput-
ers readily available through schools and public libraries if not
at home, such initiatives could be easily implemented involv-
ing the different ethno-linguistic communities, and they could
be expected to yield positive results in terms of motivating and
engaging learners while meeting the design and implementa-
tion principles (i.e., principles iv-vii) listed above.
Family Literacy Programs
"Book Floods," in the traditional and recent guises, have
been implemented in child foreign-language-acquisition
contexts in which all children in a class are learning the same
foreign language. The situation of minority languages in
Australia as described above involves a wide variety of lan-
guages, and this poses additional challenges, one of these
being the scarcity of trained teachers. One way of addressing
the linguistic diversity would be to make parents partners in
the literacy-development process. We turn now to two pro-
grams or interventions originating in the United States in the
late 1980s (Hannon, Brooks, & Bird, 2007) that support the
idea that parents can be instrumental in helping children
develop literacy (Hancock, 2002). Although these projects
aimed at improving literacy in the mainstream language, the
results hold promise in the Australian situation.
The idea that parents can assist children in developing lit-
eracy is not new. Andersson (1981), for instance, argues that
reading is learned rather than taught and that the best teacher
is the one who is intimately associated with the child and
provides the environmental stimulation to learning through
oracy and literacy experiences (Gilliam, Parten Gerla, &
Wright, 2004). Furthermore, parents' participation can
empower children in English-dominant classrooms by fos-
tering a closer alignment between home and school practices
(Hancock, 2002; Krashen, 2000) that may enhance academic
progress. A number of projects have been implemented fol-
lowing these tenets. Of those, two are summarized below.
Project ROAR (Reach Out and Read). This project was devel-
oped by Gilliam et al. (2004) and implemented in a predomi-
nantly Hispanic elementary school in Texas, United States,
in a low-socioeconomic area characterized by poor educa-
tional levels in adults and low levels of adult literacy, a situ-
ation that applies to a number of emergent communities in
Australia, such as, for instance, the Dinka community from
Southern Sudan (cf. Commonwealth of Australia, 2009, p. 4
and the 2011 Census results).18 The basic premise was that
parents want to enhance their children's academic success
but may not have the skills to do so or the confidence to try.
To address this challenge, university faculty and student vol-
unteers engaged in interactive-literacy activities with parents
and children, meeting monthly over a period of 10 months.
Sessions were conducted in a public library to familiarize
parents with the venue and expose them to books they could
borrow and included workshops on the importance of liter-
acy, storytelling, basic techniques, and activities that parents
could implement at home. In evaluating the program, parents
reported gains in their confidence, closer bonds between par-
ents and children, and increased enjoyment of books (prin-
ciple i). More important for our purposes, parents reported
that children were beginning to "read" to them and that older
siblings who did not enjoy reading previously were also
eagerly participating.
While this project was conducted in English and only
explicitly addressed one of the principles we identified as
necessary to develop autonomous reading in the home lan-
guage--although probably the most crucial one, increasing
motivation--it could easily be implemented in theAustralian
context. Based around family practices, programs such as
ROAR offer families a nonthreatening experience (principle
ii), ease of accessibility (principle v), and the flexibility to
cater for any language, age, and level of proficiency (princi-
ple iv), given the necessary resources. Moreover, the com-
munity could be involved in the creation of resources, thus
addressing the issue of cultural relevance (principle iii).
FRED (Families Reading Every Day) Books.This program,
developed by Hancock (2002), combines elements of the two
projects summarized above: quality books as in the "Book
Flood" and parents' involvement as in the ROAR project.
Eisenchlas et al. 9
However, it extends the discussion to the importance of
developing literacy initially in the home language. ROAR
was developed as a response to the challenge of teaching lin-
guistically diverse populations resulting from the increase of
minority-language children in American schools, a phenom-
enon common to Australia. Hancock saw promise in using
and building from what children already bring to the class,
namely, their home language. To test the claim that profi-
ciency in the home language facilitates the development of
proficiency in the second language (Barac & Bialystok,
2011; Cummins, 1999, 2000; Swain et al., 1990; Thomas &
Collier, 1997), Hancock conducted an experiment involving
52 native Spanish-speaking kindergartners and FRED
books--books that have been used in the United States since
the 1990s to develop pre-literacy skills in kindergarten chil-
dren. In this study, Hispanic children were assigned ran-
domly to two conditions: The 26 children in the treatment
group received FRED books written in Spanish, while the 26
children in the control group received FRED books written
in English. Each day, children took the books home for par-
ents to read to them. The results in standardized tests con-
ducted at the end of the semester supported the claims found
in the literature: Children in the treatment group outper-
formed children in the control group in pre-literacy skills. In
addition, children in the treatment group performed no dif-
ferently than their native English-speaking classmates when
exposed to books in English. These results provide further
evidence that literacy in the home language does not nega-
tively affect literacy in the majority language and points to
the gains that stem from out-of-school literacy initiatives.
Furthermore, by being based in the home, the principles we
identified above were met by the ROAR project.
Self-Directed Learning
The final model discussed in this paper was designed by
Mackey (1991) in bilingual Acadia, Canada, to develop
second-language acquisition through self-directed learning.
The basic premise of this program was that learners can teach
themselves a foreign language if sufficient stimulating mate-
rials in the target language are made available and provided
that the learning process is scaffolded by organizing the
materials according to learners'proficiency levels. The mate-
rials used in this project were analyzed and coded for degree
of difficulty, and menus were created to supply as much free-
dom of choice as possible according to the child's level and
interests.
Participants were young children, aged 8 and up who
were provided with hundreds of books, audiotapes, videos,
and software. Children selected books that seemed appeal-
ing. Because each book was linked to an audiotape, they
could either listen as they read or opt for reading or listening
only, for as long as they were interested in the task. The thor-
ough evaluation of the program provided evidence that
"children can learn a second language in the absence of
trained specialized second language teaching staff or native
speakers" (Mackey, 1991, p. 247), which led to its wide
implementation.19
What distinguishes this program from traditional lan-
guage teaching is, first, the direct contact with the new lan-
guage, bypassing teachers' input. Second, it differs in its
belief that learners this young can and should be responsible
for their own learning. Children not only selected their mate-
rials but also kept track of the work done by completing indi-
vidualized control sheets. And third, the program was
innovative in its use of widespread and generally available
technologies that handled the mechanical and repetitive tasks
usually performed by teachers, while it catered for individual
needs, interests, and proficiency levels of students.
The self-directed learning program differs from the focus
of this paper in that its aim was to develop second-language
proficiency--rather than literacy in a home language that the
children already speak. Another distinctive feature relates to
the participants' abilities, because at age 8 and above they
would already be literate, or at least could be expected to
have developed basic reading and writing skills, while we
are looking for models to develop literacy from scratch.
However, of all the models discussed in this paper, the self-
directed learning one seems to be the core and most impor-
tant one for the Australian context, as it could fulfill all the
principles required to promote autonomous learning while
bypassing the need of trained teachers in many of the com-
munity languages: A wide variety of interesting materials
(principle i) that are culturally and linguistically relevant
(principle iii) could be created through community involve-
ment, thus making it cost-effective (principle vi) and easy to
maintain and expand (principle vii). Teachers who are native
speakers of the languages could be recruited to grade and
code materials according to levels of proficiency and ages
(principle iv), thus scaffolding the learning process (princi-
ple ii). Moreover, because teachers would not be needed on
location after the grading and coding are completed, schools
and libraries could make these materials readily accessible
(principle v).
Moreover, in the two decades since this model was ini-
tially introduced in Canada, the use of technology has grown
exponentially. Computers are widely available and accessi-
ble from schools, public libraries, and homes in Australia,
and software development and applications have become
much more sophisticated and interactive. It would now be
easy to supplement books (possibly even presented as
e-books or online textual materials) with additional self-
access materials and activities, such as games, which would
be highly motivating for children. There are many reasons to
believe that if a self-directed program is effective in teaching
a second language, it would be at least as effective in teach-
ing children to read in a language that they already speak
fluently.

Conclusion
Despite the wide recognition of the cognitive, affective, and
social advantages associated with bilingualism in general
and literacy in the home language in particular, community
languages continue to be neglected in the Australian educa-
tion system. This entails a loss of opportunities for individu-
als, migrant and refugee groups, and the wider society. The
lack of support for home languages stems not only from
assimilationist-policy orientations but also from the widely
diverse ethno-linguistic composition of Australian society,
which poses great practical challenges in the implementation
of such programs, such as the lack of trained teachers in
many of the languages, diverse levels of competence in
classes, and scarcity of culturally relevant materials.
In this paper, we have attempted to address these chal-
lenges by shifting the focus away from top-down approaches
to literacy that would involve a large-scale policy shift to a
bottom­up approach based on nonformal educational prac-
tices that could supplement mainstream education. To this
end, we have proposed a number of principles that home-
language-literacy programs should meet to motivate chil-
dren, involve the diverse communities in the responsibility
of helping them become literate, and promote autonomy in
learners, so that the challenges originating from the tremen-
dous linguistic diversity can be met. We have discussed some
innovative programs that, although designed for the develop-
ment of majority-language literacy or foreign languages
mainly in classroom contexts, illustrate some of these prin-
ciples in action and have highlighted aspects of these pro-
grams that could be adapted to the linguistically and culturally
diverse Australian context.
Needless to say, there are costs involved in adapting and
implementing elements of these programs, in terms of human
resources and materials development. For instance, the initial
collection of appropriate materials and the adaptation and
development of new resources would be time-consuming and
involve financial investment. However, we strongly believe
that, for all the reasons discussed in this paper, the cost for
individuals and societies of not investing in successful home-
language-literacy programs will eventually be higher than
that of implementing them.

Notes
 1. This time period does not take into account the arrival of the
ancestors of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,
which certain estimates date to as far back as 60,000 years ago
(Blake, 1991).
 2. This is demonstrated by the current Migration Program. For the
period 2013-2014, the migrant intake has been set at 190,000
places. This comprises 60,885 places for family migrants
who are sponsored by family members already in Australia
(or 32.%), 128,550 places for skilled migrants (67.7%), and
565 places for "special eligibility" migrants (0.3%). The
Humanitarian Program is set at 20,000 places (Department
of Immigration and Border Protection, 2013). Moreover, the
latest census of population reveals that Australia has one of
the highest proportions of overseas-born residents (27%), the
third highest behind Singapore (41.5%) and Hong Kong (39%;
Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2012a).
 3. "Longer-standing" arrivals are those who arrived before 2007,
and "recent" arrivals are those who arrived in the period from
2007 to the Census Night in 2011 (August 9, 2011; Australian
Bureau of Statistics, 2012a, section on "Cultural Diversity in
Australia").
 4. According to the then Minister for Trade, Dr Craig Emerson
MP, in 2010, "Australian exports generated more than 20 per-
cent of Australia's gross domestic product. Both exports and
imports create employment: One in five Australian jobs is
related to trade and expanding our international trade will help
secure a high-skill, high-wage future" (Australian Government
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2011).
5. It is important to note that there is a "substantial overlap
between `foreign language' and `community language' [that]
is either not recognized or only seen as a problem. Some of the
most frequently taught `foreign languages' (Chinese, German,
Italian, Japanese, Korean) are also major `community lan-
guages.'However, instead of recognizing this fact as an oppor-
tunity, it is widely seen as a problem. Most heritage speakers
end up being better off choosing another language or no lan-
guage at all, than pursuing their heritage language through
mainstream schooling," as "heritage speakers" are considered
as having "an unfair advantage" over "non-heritage learners"
(Piller, 2012).
 6. The term subordinate here should be understood in relation to
the asymmetrical power between the cultural and economic
support afforded by English (the Australian majority lan-
guage) as compared with the (at best) limited support given to
indigenous and community languages (the Australian minority
languages).
7. The right of minorities to maintain their own language has
been officially recognized by UNESCO (1960) and the United
Nations (1966).
 8. The benefits of bilingualism are many and have been exten-
sible documented, so we do not include a discussion of these
here. See Barac and Bialystok (2011) for a thorough review.
 9. Possible drawbacks and challenges are addressed throughout
the paper in the relevant sections (e.g., issues affecting the
transition to the school environment).
10. The First Report on the Progress and Assimilation of Migrant
Children in Australia (Commonwealth Immigration Advisory
Council ­ Special Committee, 1960), noting that a minor-
ity of migrant children may lag behind their native-English-
speaking classmates, recommends implementing "a national
campaign, particularly through foreign-language newspapers
Eisenchlas et al. 11
to encourage parents to speak English in the home for their
children's sake" (p. 4). While, nationally, the value of bilin-
gualism is now officially recognized (most recently in the Our
Land Our Languages report; Commonwealth of Australia,
2012), what Clarke (2009) describes is still upheld by a non-
negligible part of the Australian population, who believe "that
it is a disadvantage for children to be learning two languages
at the same time" (p. 27), with parents and teachers being
"mistakenly advised that parents should give up speaking their
languages at home so that children can learn English." This
attitude is, for instance, evidenced in social blog discussions
such as at http://www.mamamia.com.au/social/no-english-in-
this-house/ from November 2012.
11. Similar conclusions have been previously reported in major
reviews, such as Francis, Lesaux, and August (2006), Genesse,
Lindolm-Leary, Saunders, and Christian (2005), and Rolstad,
Mahoney, and Glass (2005).
12. This conclusion should not be taken as an argument in favor of
sequential bilingualism. The findings relate to situations where
minority-language speakers are submersed in the mainstream-
education system at early stages of acquisition of the majority
language.
13. Although Cummins's discussion assumes the interdependence
of two languages, his proposal would presumably also apply to
speakers brought up with more than two languages, provided
the children are motivated and have reached adequate levels of
proficiency in each of their languages.
14. For a discussion on whether it is better to expose children to
simultaneous or subsequent literacy, see Baker (2006) and ref-
erences therein.
15. In 2008, the government of the Northern Territory eliminated
bilingual education in that part of Australia after more than
30 years of operation, by mandating that the first 4 hr of each
school day be taught in English (see Devlin 2009). This deci-
sion had detrimental effects such as a reduction in children's
engagement and attendance at school (Dickson, 2012a). It has
recently been reversed, and the bilingual ban has been qui-
etly abandoned (Dickson, 2012b); however, the new Literacy
Framework replacing the previous policy "has been billed as a
far cry from genuine bilingual, bicultural education. It places
a primacy on reading and writing in English, while allowing
children's home language to be used to explain new concepts"
(Murphy, 2012). For a chronology up to 2009, cf. Australian
Broadcasting Corporation (2009).
16. Interestingly, it is to avoid intergenerational conflict that the
First Report on the Progress and Assimilation of Migrant
Children in Australia (Commonwealth Immigration Advisory
Council ­ Special Committee, 1960) recommended that par-
ents switch to English, not taking into account that is would be
easier for children to maintain the home language than for par-
ents to acquire the new language to high levels of competence.
17. Note, however, that this disregards all other languages spoken
as home languages in Canada.
18. The quoted report (Commonwealth ofAustralia, 2009) focuses
exclusively on adult literacy, and, hence, its literacy improve-
ment results are not directly transferable to children's home-
language-literacy development.
19. By 1990, there were around 3,000 learners from Grades 3 to 12
involved in self-directed-language acquisition.
