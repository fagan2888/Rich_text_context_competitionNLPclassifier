Neurobiological models of drug abuse propose that drug use is initiated and maintained by rewarding
feedback mechanisms. However, the most commonly used drugs are plant neurotoxins that evolved to
punish, not reward, consumption by animal herbivores. Reward models therefore implicitly assume an
evolutionary mismatch between recent drug-profligate environments and a relatively drug-free past in
which a reward centre, incidentally vulnerable to neurotoxins, could evolve. By contrast, emerging insights
from plant evolutionary ecology and the genetics of hepatic enzymes, particularly cytochrome P450,
indicate that animal and hominid taxa have been exposed to plant toxins throughout their evolution.
Specifically, evidence of conserved function, stabilizing selection, and population-specific selection of
human cytochrome P450 genes indicate recent evolutionary exposure to plant toxins, including those that
affect animal nervous systems. Thus, the human propensity to seek out and consume plant neurotoxins is a
paradox with far-reaching implications for current drug-reward theory. We sketch some potential
resolutions of the paradox, including the possibility that humans may have evolved to counter-exploit plant
neurotoxins. Resolving the paradox of drug reward will require a synthesis of ecological and
neurobiological perspectives of drug seeking and use.

1. INTRODUCTION
The use of psychoactive substances is one of the most
perplexing human behaviours. Some substances cause
immeasurable harm to individuals and societies (e.g.
heroin) or impose a tremendous social burden in the form
of preventable chronic illnesses (e.g. tobacco), while others
appear to be mostly harmless and are widely enjoyed by
people around the world (e.g. coffee and chocolate).
Historically, a broad range of psychosocial, behavioural
and neurobiological theories seeking to understand drug
phenomena are unified by the notions of reward and
reinforcement (Thorndike 1911). According to these
theories, recreational drugs reward and/or reinforce
consumption, often via hedonic effects (Wise & Rompre
1989; Everitt & Robbins 2005; Kalivas 2005; Koob &
Le Moal 2005; Nestler 2005).
Most commonly used psychoactive drugs are plant
secondary metabolites (e.g. alkaloids) or their close
chemical analogues (table 1, see also further detail in
table 1, electronic supplementary material). Evolutionary
biologists studying plant­herbivore interactions have con-
vincingly argued that many plant secondary metabolites,
including alkaloids such as nicotine, morphine and cocaine,
are potent neurotoxins that evolved to deter consumption
by herbivores (Karban & Baldwin 1997; Roberts & Wink
1998).1 On the other hand, neurobiology's reward model
sees interactions between drugs and the nervous system as
rewarding and reinforcing. Hence, in their current forms,
neurobiology's reward model and evolutionary biology's
punishment model appear to be incompatible. We term this
incompatibility the paradox of drug reward.
Several theorists have attempted to explain drug reward
from an evolutionary perspective emphasizing fitness
consequences (Tooby & Cosmides 1990; Nesse & Berridge
1997; Johns 1999; Smith 1999; Kelley & Berridge 2002;
Newlin 2002). In this view, behaviours beneficial to an
animal's reproductive success are rewarded and/or
reinforced by positive emotions, while behaviours with
fitness-impairing consequences are discouraged with
negative emotions. This perspective holds that drugs of
abuse subvert natural reward circuits by creating a signal in
thebrainfalselyindicatingthe arrivalof a hugefitnessbenefit
(positive reinforcement), and by blocking painful feelings or
affect states, `short circuiting' the adaptive functions of
negative emotions (Nesse & Berridge 1997).
This current evolutionary interpretation of brain
function and reward could potentially resolve the paradox,
but carries with it several assumptions with which we
intend to take issue. These are summarized below.
(i) The widespread availability of drugs in the present is
an evolutionary novelty, or mismatch; meaning that
the brain, and its putative reward centres, evolved in

ancestraldrug-freeenvironments(Tooby&Cosmides
1990; Nesse & Berridge 1997; Smith 1999). To the
contrary, we will argue that the evolutionary biological
evidence strongly indicates that humans and other
animals have been exposed to drugs throughout their
evolution,andwillbasethisargumentonananalysisof
the evolution of hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450)
that metabolize environmental chemicals.
(ii) The brain and its reward centres are inherently
vulnerable to drugs (Nesse & Berridge 1997). This
idea follows from the `mismatch' assumption. If drug
exposure is an evolutionary novelty, then it logically
follows that the brain does not have evolved defences
to protect it from psychoactive substances. If such
exposures were not novel then, as (Nesse & Berridge
1997) point out, `Hundreds of generations of
exposure would likely shape resistance to [drugs']
allure and .deleterious effects.' We will use evidence
from the genetics of drug metabolism to show that
humans have been exposed to plant neurotoxins
throughout their evolution, and to indicate that we are
unlikely to be inherently vulnerable to drugs.
(iii) Drugs of abuse are intrinsically rewarding and that
sentientrewardscorrelatewithfitness consequences. To
the contrary, we will argue that commonly used
drugs are often experienced as affectively unpleasant
by neophyte users (i.e. non-rewarding) and are
identified physiologically as toxic (non-rewarding)
in the nervous system.
Among the points of contention described above, the
key question is that of `novelty' or mismatch--whether or
not our ancestors were exposed to psychoactive neuro-
toxins. Our rejection of the assumption that drugs are
evolutionarily novel, we will argue, leaves the paradox of
drug reward unresolved. Although we see no obvious
resolution to the paradox, we conclude by sketching some
possibilities, including a consideration of the potential
adaptive outcomes of an evolutionary exposure to plant
neurotoxins in humans.
2. ACUTE DRUG REWARD: THE NEUROBIOLOGICAL
PERSPECTIVE
Neurobiological theory of drug use distinguishes between
initial seeking and use, and the longer term phenomena of
drug tolerance and addiction. Causal theories of both
`stages' of drug use employ the concepts of reward or
reinforcement: as motivation for drug seeking and in the
acute effects of initial use, and in the maintenance of long-
term drug use and the neuroplastic changes that occur in
response to chronic drug exposure. It is not surprising
then, that the motivations for neophyte drug use are often
conflated by a failure to distinguish between the causes of
initial and long-term drug use (Wallace 2004). Our focus
is on the most enigmatic phase of drug use--initial drug
seeking and its acute effects, which we detail here, and not
on the distinct processes of dependence and addiction
(for recent reviews of the neurobiology of addiction see
Kalivas & Volkow (2005) and Nestler (2005); for a list of
theories of addiction, see West (2001)). Note that neither
stage of drug-use theory typically incorporates evolution-
ary insights (cf. Lende 2007).
The leading neurobiological model of acute drug
reward and reinforcement is the mesolimbic dopamine
system (MDS). In simplified terms, the MDS comprises
dopaminergic neurons projecting from the ventral teg-
mental area (VTA) in the midbrain to the nucleus
accumbens (NAc) in the basal forebrain. The degree of
activity of the dopaminergic projections affects concen-
trations of extracellular dopamine in the NAc (Kelley &
Berridge 2002; Koob & Le Moal 2005; Nestler 2005).
An influential interpretation of dopamine function in
the MDS followed from the observation that dopamine
receptor blockade induced an `anhedonia' in rats, which
was not explained by sedation or motor side effects (Wise
et al. 1978). In other words, under what is sometimes
referred to as the hedonia hypothesis, dopamine mediates
the unconditioned pleasure produced by food, sex, etc., as
well as the conditioned pleasure produced by secondary
reinforcers like drugs.
The discovery that dopamine neurons fail to respond
when animals receive an anticipated reward contradicts the
hedonia hypothesis, suggesting instead that the response
of midbrain dopaminergic neurons might encode predic-
tion errors--the difference between predicted and
obtained rewards--rather than absolute reward. Under
this hypothesis, unpredicted rewards elicit activation of
midbrain dopaminergic neurons (positive prediction
error), fully predicted rewards elicit no response, and the
omission of predicted rewards induces a depression
(negative prediction; Schultz 1998).
The incentive salience hypothesis (Robinson & Berridge
1993; Berridge & Robinson 1998) represents a further
revision of the original hedonia hypothesis. This perspective
stresses that manipulation of dopamine transmission has a
powerful impact on motivation without changing hedonic
reactions, and that `wanting' is neurologically, psychologi-
cally and conceptually distinct from `liking'. In this view, the
MDS mediates wanting and not liking (i.e. not hedonia).
Despite diverse mechanisms of action and hetero-
geneous effects in the brain and periphery, initial and acute
exposure to all drugs of abuse is thought to interfere with
the normal functions of the MDS by increasing dopamin-
ergic transmission in the NAc (Nestler 2005). For
example, stimulants such as amphetamines and cocaine
directly increase dopaminergic transmission in the NAc;
opiates inhibit GABAergic interneurons in the VTA by
disinhibiting VTA dopamine neurons projecting to the
NAc; and nicotine seems to activate VTA dopamine
neurons both directly and indirectly via stimulation

precise effects of increased dopamine levels are not yet
resolved, this drug-induced increase is widely believed to
reward and/or reinforce drug use (Kelley & Berridge
2002; Koob & Le Moal 2005; Nestler 2005).
3. PLANT CHEMICAL PUNISHMENT OF
HERBIVORES: THE EVOLUTIONARY
BIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE
The relationship between living plants and the animals
that feed on them is antagonistic, forged by an intense and
ongoing evolutionary arms race. In the evolution of life,
autotrophs--plants, algae and some bacteria that syn-
thesize organic compounds from inorganic sources of
carbon and energy--became the ultimate source of raw
materials and energy for heterotrophs--the animals, fungi,
protists, bacteria and viruses that constitute the Earth's
remaining biota.2
Plants and other autotrophs have evolved an impressive
array of chemical defences to deter heterotrophic pre-
dators (insect and vertebrate herbivores, fungi and
microbes; Wink 1998). All cellular organisms possess
internal signalling systems to regulate metabolism, growth
and reproduction, which depend on small quantities of
simple molecules such as amines, peptides, steroids and
lipids. Although such systems are efficient, they are
vulnerable to manipulation by adversaries. As a key
facet of their chemical defence, many autotrophs have
coevolved compounds that are either identical to or
closely mimic these signalling molecules; thus enabling
autotrophs to subject herbivores to disrupting chemical
attacks. For example, one or more plant alkaloids have
been identified that interfere with nearly every step in
neural signalling. Targets include neurotransmitter
synthesis, storage, release, binding, deactivation and
reuptake, ion channel activation and function, and key
enzymes involved in signal transduction (Wink 2000).
Paradoxically, the same properties invoked to explain
why common drugs like caffeine, nicotine and cocaine are
toxic are also those invoked to explain why these
compounds are rewarding. It is therefore important to
stress that these and other addictive drugs appear to have
evolved only because they successfully deterred, not
rewarded or reinforced, plant consumption. Among
drugs of abuse, the data are particularly clear for nicotine,
an alkaloid that binds to acetylcholine receptors. Nicotiana
attenuata is an important model species for the analysis of
plant­herbivore interactions involving nicotine. It is a
domesticated North American tobacco plant that is
attacked by over 20 different herbivores, ranging from
mammalian browsers to intracellular-feeding insects
(Baldwin 2001). These attacks elicit a battery of defensive
responses, including nicotine production.
For example, under natural conditions, Nicotiana with
transgenically downregulated nicotine production lost three-
fold more leaf area to herbivores than did wild-type plants,
supporting a defensive function for nicotine (Steppuhn et al.
2004). Nicotiana treated with jasmonic acid (JA) to boost
concentrations of nicotine and other defences had less leaf
loss to mammalian browsers, lower mortality rate and
produced more viable seed than size-matched controls.
The insect herbivore, tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta)
showed dramatically lower survivorship and growth on
JA-treated plants than on untreated controls. However, for
plants not subject to herbivory, JA treatment reduced seed
production by 26% relative to controls, demonstrating that
chemical defences are expensive to produce. Nicotiana has
therefore evolved to allocate chemical defences strategically
by concentrating them in the most valuable parts of the plant,
such as young leaves, stems and reproductive organs, and
by modulating its production according to the type of
herbivore and extent of leaf damage (Baldwin 2001).
Herbivores have coevolved a number ofcountermeasures
in response to the evolution of autotroph chemical defences
including: chemosensors that permit selective feeding on
less toxic tissues, compounds that prevent or attenuate
induction of autotroph chemical defences, mechanisms that
extract benefits from defensive chemicals (e.g. by metaboliz-
ing them or sequestering them to aid heterotrophic chemical
defence against predators), symbiotic relationships with
microbes to detoxify or extract nutrients from plant
defences, cellular membranes for multidrug transport and,
perhaps most commonly, enzymes that detoxify plant
secondary compounds (Karban & Agrawal 2002). We will
return to the latter topic shortly.
4. IS DRUG EXPOSURE AN EVOLUTIONARY
NOVELTY?
Neurobiologists have made a strong case that drug seeking
and use is intimately related to neural circuitry involved in
reward and/or reinforcement. However, evolutionary
biologists have made an equally strong case that plant
neurotoxins evolved to punish, not reward, plant con-
sumers, and that it is in the fitness interests of both plant
and consumer that the consumer is averse to the plant's
defensive toxins. From the perspective of evolutionary
ecology, plants should not have evolved defensive
chemicals that easily trigger reward in consumers, and
consumers should not have evolved neural circuitry that
readily but inadvertently rewards or reinforces consump-
tion of numerous neurotoxins.
Several evolutionary theorists have argued that the
MDS evolved to reinforce behaviours that successfully
resulted in food acquisition, mating and other fitness-
enhancing outcomes, and is maladaptively triggered by
evolutionarily novel exposure to psychoactive plant toxins
(Tooby & Cosmides 1990; Nesse & Berridge 1997; Johns
1999; Smith 1999; Kelley & Berridge 2002; Newlin
2002). If exposure to plant neurotoxins is evolutionarily
novel, then humans should exhibit little evidence of
evolved countermeasures.
(a) Detoxification enzymes: a coevolved counter-
measure in humans and other animals
Here we explore a key superfamily of detoxification
enzymes to assess whether they support the hypothesis
that exposure to plant neurotoxins is evolutionarily novel
for humans. The principal heterotroph detoxification
enzymes are the cytochrome P450 (CYP) haemoproteins.
CYPs are ubiquitous in Bacteria and Eukarya, and have
been found in many Archaea species, suggesting that the
ancestral CYP gene evolved approximately 3.5 Gyr ago.
The metabolism of endogenous fatty acids and steroido-
genesis appear to have been the original (and still central)
functions of most CYP genes. With the rise of terrestrial
Review. The paradox of drug reward R. J. Sullivan et al. 1233
Proc. R. Soc. B (2008)
plants and animals approximately 400 Myr ago, the major
functions of CYPs expanded to encompass the detoxifica-
tion of dietary phytochemicals via a coevolutionary
process involving dozens of gene duplication events
(Nelson 1999; Lewis 2001). There are approximately 76
CYP families known in animals, with 57 of these present
in humans (Nelson et al. 2004).
Although CYPs are found in many tissues, in humans
and other mammalsthey are concentrated in the liver, where
they catalyse the oxidation of a wide range of endogenous
and exogenous chemicals in phase I metabolism. CYP
oxidases introduce an atom of molecular oxygen into the
structure of a lipophilic substrate (such as a toxin/drug) to
render it more hydrophilic prior to conjugation to a carrier
molecule in phase II metabolism for export from the body.
In mammals, CYPs are responsible for oxidizing over 90%
of drugs and other xenobiotics (Lewis 2001).
Several CYP families are highly conserved across
species, whereas others are quite variable. The conserved
CYP 5 and higher families have endogenous functions
such as bile acid metabolism and cholesterol and steroid
biosynthesis, and show remarkable cross-species simi-
larity. For example, 21 out of the 22 human and mouse
genes in these families are orthologous (Nelson 1999).
By contrast, most of the drug-metabolizing enzymes
are in the variable group (Nelson 1999). The CYP 2 and
CYP 3 families, for example, are phylogenetically
divergent with 16 human CYP 2 genes and 4 CYP 3
genes, as opposed to 51 CYP 2 and 8 CYP 3 genes in mice
(Nelson et al. 2004). There is only one 2D gene (2D6) in
humans, whereas there are nine 2D genes in mice (Nelson
et al. 2004). A comparison of the human genome with the
initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome similarly found
rapid evolutionary divergence in xenobiotic-metabolizing
genes (The Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Con-
sortium 2005), as well as divergence in genes expressed in
the liver (Khaitovich et al. 2005). The latter finding is
supported by in vivo pharmacokinetic studies. For
instance, systemic clearance of propranolol, verapamil,
theophylline and 12 other synthetic drugs in chimpanzees
and humans ranged from close to parity to a 10-fold
variation, with CYP2D enzyme activity approximately
10 times higher in the chimpanzee, a species that notably
subsists primarily on plants (Wong 2004).
The emergence of xenobiotic-metabolizing CYP in
animals at about the same time as the evolution of
terrestrial plants, the localization of cross-species variation
in CYP genes within the xenobiotic-metabolizing subset,
and the large species differences in drug metabolism
suggest species-specific adaptation to frequently encoun-
tered plant toxins and other environmental chemicals.
(b) Evolution in human xenobiotic-metabolizing
cytochrome P450
The mammalian cytochrome P450 phylogenetic data are
compelling evidence of a long evolutionary history of
exposure to plant toxins. As mammals, humans have
phylogenetically `inherited' the cytochrome P450 system
for detoxification of environmental chemicals. This fact
alone would seem to falsify the hypothesis that human
exposure to drugs is evolutionarily novel--that there has
been a mismatch between contemporary drug-profligate
and ancestral environments that were `drug' free. But
humans are taxonomically unique in several respects,
particularly in regard to the relative magnitude of culture
and technology. A scenario that might preserve the
mismatch hypothesis is that the evolving human nervous
system was `protected' in a unique cultural or ecological
niche that excluded plant neurotoxins. In this scenario, the
phylogenetically inherited mammalian P450 adaptation
was superfluous until the proliferation of drugs in the
modern era. The Homo genus with its meat-rich diet and
detoxification technology (e.g. fire), probably had reduced
toxins in its diet relative to the chimpanzee (Ingelman-
Sundberg 2005). However, several lines of evidence
indicate that our ancestors were regularly exposed to
plant neurotoxins, and do not constitute a special case in
mammalian evolution.
(i) Conserved function
Perhaps the most compelling argument that humans have
experienced relatively recent selection pressures from plant
toxins is that xenobiotic-metabolizing function is con-
served. Psychoactive plant toxins are substrates of CYP
enzymes (table 2) with enzyme activity levels similar to
those for endogenous hormones and essential fatty acids
(table 2 in the electronic supplementary material). If plant
toxins were not a recent selection pressure on humans, then
loss of enzyme function through genetic drift would be
expected. For the majority of phenotypes, loss of function
from drift does not appear to have occurred.
(ii) Stabilizing selection
Solus et al. (2004) sequenced 11 out of the 23 genes in the
xenobiotic-metabolizing CYP1, CYP2 and CYP3
families. DNA was sampled from 93 ethnically diverse
humans, including Caucasians, African-Americans and
Asians. Although measures of genetic diversity indicated
these genes were comparatively rich in variation (mostly as
a consequence of low-frequency polymorphism), four
independent measures also indicated that these genes are
under selection against non-synonymous amino acid
changes in coding regions. Across all genes, for example,
the ratio of variation in non-synonymous versus synon-
ymous coding regions, pNS
/pS
, was 0.27, signifying
stabilizing selection and thus a recent evolutionary history
of exposure to xenobiotics such as plant toxins. For several
key enzymes, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C19 and
CYP2E1, these ratios were particularly low (pNS
/pSZ
0.08, 0.08, 0.06 and 0.08, respectively).
(iii) Population-specific selection
Most polymorphisms in CYP genes are of low frequency,
but several are found with relatively high frequency in
certain populations. In some cases, high-frequency poly-
morphisms can be plausibly associated with the local plant
ecology. Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, for example,
have very high frequencies of 2D6 ultrametabolizers:
individuals with multiple functional copies of 2D6 genes
(Aynacioglu et al. 1999). This pattern suggests positive
selection for CYP2D6 (Ingelman-Sundberg 2005), an
enzyme that metabolizes opiates and amphetamine-like
compounds, together with other substrates. Perhaps not
coincidentally, the opium poppy is native to the Turkish
region, and khat (a plant containing amphetamine-like
compounds) is native to North East Africa and is
ubiquitously chewed in Ethiopia and the Arabian Peninsula
(Sullivan & Hagen 2002; Sullivan 2003).

Proc. R. Soc. B (2008)
(iv) Reduced selection
In most cases, no compelling explanation exists for high-
frequency population-specific CYP polymorphisms. Some
high-frequency polymorphisms produce low or non-
functioning enzymes that suggest reduced or no selection
by certain categories of xenobiotics. Such evidence could
undermine the argument that humans have been under
recent selection by plant toxins; we address this potential
objection by investigating two CYP genes in detail.
CYP2D6 is well studied and constitutes approximately
19% of total drug metabolism in vivo (Lewis 2001), with
more than 100 alleles identified (Nelson et al. 2008).
CYP2A6 is less researched, but is important here as the
principal metabolizing enzyme of nicotine. CYP2A6
constitutes 2­3% of total drug metabolism in humans
(Lewis 2001) and has more than 30 currently recognized
alleles (Nelson et al. 2008). Together, CYP2D6 and
CYP2A6 are representatives of current descriptive knowl-
edge in human pharmacogenetics. The majority of 2D6
and 2A6 alleles have low frequencies, consistent with
stabilizing selection, but a few have high frequencies in
some populations. Table 3 lists several alleles for which
in vivo enzyme activity has been measured (see also table 3
in the electronic supplementary material).
Some of the strongest evidence of reduced selection for,
or selection against, a particular CYP enzyme occurs in
Asian populations, among which the highest frequencies
of non-functioning CYP2A6 alleles are observed. Assum-
ing Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium, the allele frequencies in
table 3 indicate that approximately 4% of Japanese are
non-metabolizers (Ã4/Ã4), and another 16% lack a normal
metabolizing allele (e.g. Ã7/Ã7, Ã9/Ã9, Ã4/Ã7, Ã4/Ã9).
Nonetheless, individuals with the latter genotypes still
metabolize nicotine adequately, albeit at somewhat
reduced levels. In one study of Koreans, for example,
the cotinine/nicotine ratio (an in vivo measure of enzyme
activity) was 10.4 for the Ã1A/Ã1A genotype, 7.7 for
Ã1A/Ã9 and 4.3 for Ã9/Ã9 (Yoshida et al. 2003). Similarly,
up to 10% of some Caucasian populations and 19% of
South African San are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers
(Sommers et al. 1988; Bernard et al. 2006).
Although humans have probably been exposed to fewer
plant toxins than our non-human ancestors (Ingelman-
Sundberg 2005), we believe that these population-level
patterns of 2A6 and 2D6 enzyme activity more strongly
support a hypothesis of relatively recent population-
specific selection by particular categories of xenobiotics,
rather than a global near absence of exposure to plant
toxins across human evolution (Sullivan 2003). For
example, although Asians have high frequencies of non-
functional 2A6 alleles, they also have low frequencies of
non-functional 2D6 alleles, a pattern that is more or less
reversed in Caucasians (table 3). If Asians and Caucasians
had not been subjected to selection from xenobiotics, then
both populations should have high frequencies of non-
functional alleles for both genes. Overall, 2D6 and 2A6
adequately metabolize typical substrates in 90% of
individuals, albeit at variable rates.
We interpret the conserved function in human CYP
enzymes, the statistical evidence of stabilizing selection
and the existence of both species- and population-specific
polymorphisms as evidence that humans have undergone
relatively recent selection by plant toxins frequently
encountered in local environments. This hypothesis, if
correct, has important implications for reward models of
drug seeking and acute drug use.
5. THE PARADOX OF HUMAN DRUG USE
(a) Are we inherently vulnerable to drugs?
The notion that we are inherently vulnerable to drugs is
implicit in neurobiological models of the mammalian
MDS. The current assumption is that the MDS is easily
triggered by a broad range of neurotoxins because it was
not exposed to such toxins during its evolution (Nesse &
Berridge 1997). The coevolution of the xenobiotic-
metabolizing CYP families contradicts this view by
demonstrating that heterotroph signalling systems have
successfully endured a relentless chemical assault by
autotrophs for hundreds of millions of years.
The long exposure to plant neurotoxins indicated by
the CYP data make it unlikely that humans, or other
mammals, are inherently vulnerable to drugs. This
conclusion amounts to a rejection of the conventional
evolutionary explanation of drug use, dependent as it is on
the notion that the MDS evolved in the absence of
selection pressures from plant neurotoxins (Nesse &
Berridge 1997) or, in broader theoretical terms, that the
reward and/or reinforcement functions of the MDS were
somehow exempt from the implications of evolutionary
biology's punishment model.
To reiterate our broader argument here, the phylogenetic
evidence for coevolution of animal CYP and plant toxins
reinforces the evolutionary biological perspective that plant
neurotoxins evolved because they punished and deterred
consumption by herbivores (Karban & Baldwin 1997;
Table 2. Examples of human cytochrome P450 enzymes

Roberts & Wink 1998), and is in direct conflict with
neurobiology's reward model which sees drug use as
rewarded and reinforced in the MDS. We termed this
incompatibility the paradox of drug reward. Before sketching
potential resolutions of the paradox of drug reward, we
respond to several objections to our argument that emerge
directly from the substantial data generated in support of
current reward models like the MDS drug-reward pathway.
(b) Does initial drug use elicit hedonic rewards
and false-positive fitness signals?
Nesse & Berridge (1997) and others (Tooby & Cosmides
1990; Johns 1999; Smith 1999; Kelley & Berridge 2002;
Newlin 2002) propose that positive and negative affective
experiences and sensations are related to fitness con-
sequences, and that drugs interfere with affectively
mediated fitness signals. We find this perspective proble-
matic in several ways.
First, commonly used drugs have multiple nervous
system `targets' and may activate physiological responses
that are unpleasant or physiological systems that do not
mediate affective experiences. For example, the widely used
drug arecoline (betel nut) not only binds to muscarinic
receptors in the brain, but also exerts potent effects in the
peripheral nervous system (PNS) inducing tremor, face
flushing, sweating, changes in heart rate and blood pressure,
salivation, nausea and broncoconstriction (Chu 1993,
1995). The unpleasant consequences of PNS-binding sites
are shared by all of the most commonly used plant drugs
(e.g. tobacco, betel nut, khat, cola nut, coffee, tea, coca,
cannabis). In regard to tobacco, Eissenberg & Balster
(2000) demonstrated that neophyte users typically experi-
ence nausea and other aversive affects, not hedonic
rewards. Most commonly used plant drugs are correctly
and unsurprisingly `recognized' as toxins by most new users,
both physiologically and affectively, and the physical and
affective responses are accurate warnings of fitness costs,
rather than a false `positive' signal of a fitness benefit.
Second, modern euphoric drugs, like heroin, might
represent a genuine evolutionary mismatch--drugs that are
vastly more pleasurable than any neurotoxins occurring
naturally in ancestral environments (Nesse & Berridge
1997; Smith 1999; Nesse 2002). Yet, in population terms,
euphoric drug use is trivial when compared with mundane
drugs such as tobacco, cannabis and betel nut. We
compiled data from the 2004 annual federal survey of
drug use in the USA, to show that regular users of heroin
are an extremely small proportion of the population (0.2%)
and even the numbers of regular users of cocaine, `crack'
and amphetamines are markedly smaller (2.4, 0.5 and 0.6%
of the population, respectively) than the proportions of
tobacco and cannabis users (34 and 11%, respectively,
`used in the last year'; figure 1). These data suggest that the
exception--use of euphoric drugs by very small proportions
of human populations--has been used to prove the `rule' of
hedonic drug reward. Stiff legal penalties might partially
explain the exceptionally low frequency of euphoric drug
consumption (DuPont & Voth 1995), but they obviously
cannot explain the high frequency of non-euphoric drug
consumption. Euphoric drug use is a poor model for a
general theory of human, or mammalian, drug use. We
suggest that commonly used non-euphoric drugs should be
the basis for new models of human substance use that
reflect major, rather than minor, population-use trends.
(c) Potency
Smith (1999) and Nesse (2002) have argued that even
commonly useddrugs are more potentand are morelikely to
be encountered today than they were by our ancestors. We
have countered elsewhere that firstly, the most commonly
used drugs in the ancestral past are the same drugs that are
still most commonly used today, e.g. tobacco, coffee, tea,
cannabis, betel nut, khat, coca and cola nut (Sullivan &
Hagen 2002), and secondly, that the concentrations of
alkaloids like nicotine in the wild (or partially domesticated)
species encountered by our ancestors is generally higher
than in the domesticated species currently used in the
manufacture of commercial brands (Watson 1983).
The issues surrounding domestication and potency are
complex and contradictory: domestication of edible plants
has employed detoxifying cultural technologies to make
food safer and more palatable (Johns 1990), whereas
plants used as drugs appear to have been artificially
selected for potency, rather than detoxification (Sullivan &
Hagen 2002). Although issues of domestication require
further research, there is little evidence that the transitions

to horticulture and agriculture provided an evolutionary
`window' free from human exposure to plant neurotoxins.
(d) Routes of delivery
It has been argued that the mismatch might not be in the
nature of the drugs, but in their method of delivery, e.g. via
hypodermic needle to bypass first-pass metabolism (Nesse
2002). However, many drug-containing plants are simply
chewed or smoked, and pre-industrial and prehistoric
societies often used drug delivery methods, such as free-
basing techniques in combination with the buccal­oral
route that ensured that these drugs were pure (i.e.
chemically unbound) and bypassed first-pass metabolism
(Sullivan & Hagen 2002). Given the simplicity of these
methods, it is entirely plausible that they have been used as
long as there have been cognitively modern people, that is,
for more than 100 000 years.
(e) Animal data of drug reward
Some of the strongest data supporting drug reinforcement
models have emerged from decades of research using
laboratory animals (Liebman & Cooper 1989). Taking
these results at face value, however, does not invalidate our
critique. The xenobiotic-metabolizing CYP1, CYP2 and
CYP3 families are well represented in all mammals for
which data are available, including mice, rats, rabbits and
primates, and the evidence for coevolution of neurotoxins
and mammalian CYP shows that exposure to high
concentrations of plant alkaloids is no more an evolution-
ary novelty for rats or rabbits than it is for humans
(Rat Genome Sequencing Project Consortium 2004).
Hence, drug reward is as much as a paradox for laboratory
animals as it is for humans.
This insight suggests that we should pay particular
attention to animal learning research that has incorporated
evolutionarily and ecologically plausible experimental
conditions. For example, the classic studiesbyPetrinovich &
Bolles (1954) and Garcia & Ervin (1968) showed that
murine experimental outcomes that contradict conven-
tional classical and instrumental conditioning theory are
explicable only when interpreted from an evolutionary
perspective. Garcia & Ervin (1968) showed that rats will
avoid novel foods paired with an aversive association after a
single trial, but only if the aversive experience is nausea.
Petrinovich & Bolles (1954) demonstrated that rats find it
easier to learn relationships that are consistent with their
natural ecology, and will make such associations indepen-
dently of experimentally induced motivational states such as
hunger and thirst. Garcia & Ervin's insights may be
particularly relevant to our argument in that plant toxins
may have provided the phylogenetic basis for the con-
ditioned taste aversions observed in rats. A third example is
the work of Green et al. (2002) showing that rats in
`enriched' environments (i.e. those that are relatively less
artificial) are less inclined to lever press for drug rewards.
The common element in all of these studies, experimental
conditions that are ecologically `normal' to the laboratory
animal, is missing from other studies that have been hugely
influential on the theory of drug reward such as Olds &
Milner's classic research of electrical brain stimulation in
the rat (Olds & Milner 1954).
6. POTENTIAL RESOLUTIONS OF THE PARADOX:
NOVEL DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
Evolutionary rationales that can accommodate current
drug-reward models might include that the most com-
monly used plant drugs today have exploited human
pleasurable `tastes' to encourage domestication, much in
the way that sweet tasting fruits and nectar promote seed
and pollen dispersal by animals (Nesse 2002). Tobacco
stands as a counter-example to this hypothosis. Nicotine
evolved before humans, is toxic for tobacco herbivores, is
induced in tobacco plants when subject to herbivory, and
has no known function for seed dispersal by non-human
species. Thus, it is unlikely that it evolved to exploit
pleasurable tastes of humans or other animals.

Review. The paradox of drug reward R. J. Sullivan et al. 1237
Proc. R. Soc. B (2008)
Even if psychoactive plant toxins are not an evolutionary
novelty, it is possible that a few toxins incidentally activate
reward circuitry (Nesse 2002). As discussed previously,
however, responses to first use of tobacco and other
recreational drugs are usually aversive with nausea and
vomiting as a commonly occurring outcome (Eissenberg &
Balster 2000; Sullivan & Hagen 2002). In neurobiological
terms, most drugs are recognized as toxins, suggesting that
the paradox of drug reward might be usefully informed by a
greater understanding of why aversion mechanisms and
aversive learning do not overcome drug reward and
reinforcement (Hagen et al. in preparation).
Not all neurobiological theories of drug use invoke
evolvedneuralsignallingpathways.Theoriesofchronicdrug
use emphasize neuroplastic `adaptations' to chronic
drug exposure and addiction, and focus less on hedonic
feedback circuits that motivate initial drug seeking
and responses to acute drug exposure (Kalivas 2005;
Shaham & Hope 2005). Such models, as non-evolutionary
explanations for habituated drug use, do not necessarily
conflict with the evidence of plant­animal coevolution.
(a) Questioning a unitary reward model
There is a near consensus that all recreational drugs increase
dopaminergic transmission in the NAc, however, when
compared with opiates, the mechanisms by which they do
so are `more conjectural' (Nestler 2005). For instance,
mesolimbic and neostriatal dopamine projections are
crucial to sensorimotor function, which, in turn, means
that sensorimotor responses to dopamine manipulation
complicate a clear understanding of dopamine's role in
reward (Berridge & Robinson 1998). Furthermore, on the
basis of observations that do not easily fit prevailing reward
and reinforcement models of the MDS, several researchers
have suggested that the MDS involves broader functions
such as attention, complex sensorimotor integration, effort
or behavioural programme switching (see, e.g. Horvitz
2000; Salamone et al. 2005). If so, drug use could be
explained by effects other than, or in addition to, reward and
reinforcement. A unitary reward model for all drugs of
abuse, in other words, is not yet established.
Although the unitary account of drug use provided by
the MDS model is elegant, we believe that it would also be
beneficial to explore drug-specific mechanisms. It is
commonly recognized that different drugs have profoundly
different and wide-ranging effects on the CNS and PNS,
and it is likely that the explanation for opiate use could differ
in fundamental ways from the explanation for tobacco use.
For example, it is relatively easier to induce the self-
administration of opiates than nicotine in laboratory
animals (Le Foll & Goldberg 2006). It is important to
keep in mind that the opium poppy evolved morphine to
replace endogenous endorphins at m-opioid receptors, and
that the tobacco plant evolved nicotine to replace
endogenous acetylcholine at cholinergic receptors, in the
CNS and PNS (table 1), not to activate the MDS
`downstream'. If we were to consider each toxin/receptor
relationship as a distinct ecological phenomenon with, firstly,
its own neurochemistry reflecting plant-defence strategies
and, secondly, potential consumer counter-strategies, we
may find that multiple drug pathway models can account
for neurobiological and behavioural data of acute drug
states better than the current comprehensive models.
(b) Ecological approaches to drug use
Thus far, we can summarize certain common elements
that should be present in ecological and/or evolutionary
approaches to research of substance use as follows.
(i) Making a distinction between the causes of
neophyte use and the physiological and behavioural
processes associated with chronic drug use.
(ii) Using information about natural patterns of
seeking and use. For example, what are the
ecologically salient factors affecting initial use
patterns in humans and animals?
(iii) Using independent variables that are ecologically
meaningful, or plausible, to the experimental
subject; that is, which reflect a plausible aspect of
the animal's natural ecology and evolutionary
history. For example, the key elements of Garcia &
Ervin's (1968) classic study--food paired with
nausea--are `ecologically plausible' to the rat; by
contrast, the electrical brain stimulation used in
Olds & Milner's famous study (1954) has no natural
parallel in the ecology or phylogeny of the rat.
(iv) Focusingon theprimaryneurobiologicaltargetofthe
neurotoxin rather thandownstreaminteractionswith
dopamine and/or the NAc. For example, the
neurotoxin nicotine has evolved to bind with
cholinergic receptors, not dopaminergic receptors;
what are the primary physiological (and behavioural)
correlates of cholinergic receptor binding, and how
do they relate to 1, 2 and 3 above?
(v) Considering the possibility of coevolutionary pro-
cesses. Animals that are ecologically exposed to plant
neurotoxins often evolve strategies and adaptations
to counter-exploit the neurotoxin.
In regard to the latter, the broad patterns of human drug-
seeking behaviour (see the macro trends in the US National
Survey data; figure 1) may reflect active substance seeking
mediated by presently unknown toxin-exploiting
mechanisms, similar to those found in numerous other
species (Karban & Agrawal 2002), rather than an inherent
vulnerability to drugs. For example, Bentz & Barbosa
(1990) demonstrated that the food use efficiency of
unparasitized tobacco hornworm larvae was significantly
reduced by ingestion of nicotine. However, larvae that
consumed food containing nicotine were themselves
protected from parasitism by the wasp Cotesia congregata.
Parasitized larvae that consumed a nicotine-laced diet had
significantly greater efficiency in conversion of ingested and
digested food than parasitized larvae without dietary
nicotine, presumably because nicotine was worse for the
parasitic wasps than it was for the hornworm larvae (an
example of what ecologists call pharmacophagy). Note that
the benefit of nicotine exposure exceeded the cost only
when the hornworm was itself parasitized. This example
demonstrates both the cost of toxin consumption to
co-adapted species (tobacco hornworm/Nicotiana) and
how a targeted plant predator may counter-exploit the
toxins deployed against it.
In this light, it has been proposed that toxins in fava
beans and cassava might be effective against Plasmodium
falciparum infections in humans (Jackson 1990, 1996), that
the ubiquitous use of spices could be an adaptation to
exploit plant alkaloids to combat bacterial infections of
1238 R. J. Sullivan et al. Review. The paradox of drug reward

food (Billing & Sherman 1998), and that the evidence that
primates and other animals use the toxic properties of plants
to self-medicate, especially against gastrointestinal
parasites, may provide an evolutionary basis for human
medicinal behaviour (Johns 1990, 1999; Huffman 1997).
We have hypothesized elsewhere that hominins may have
exploited plant toxins to overcome nutritional and energetic
constraints on CNS signalling (Sullivan & Hagen 2002).
Here we note that some recreational drugs attack human
pathogens. For example, of the world's three most popular
alkaloid drugs--caffeine (coffee), nicotine (tobacco) and
arecoline (betel nut)--two, in the form of nicotine sulphate
and arecoline hydrobromide, are potent commercial
anthelmintics used in animals (Eckert et al. 1981;
Hammond et al. 1997). Dried tobacco leaves, stalks and
the whole herb are still employed by farmers in parts of the
developing world to treat helminth infections in livestock,
and it has been shown that an aqueous extract of nicotine
from tobacco leaves is quite effective against helminth
infections in cattle and sheep (Msolla et al. 1987; Iqbal et al.
2006). Like nicotine, modern anthelmintics such as
levamisole and tetrahydropyrimidines target nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors on somatic muscle cells, inducing
spastic paralysis and parasite expulsion (Kohler 2001).
Nicotinic receptors are also targeted by recently developed
`neonicotinoid' agents effective against fleas, ticks and other
arthropod parasites (Tomizawa & Casida 2005).
Although we are not aware of any quantitative studies,
orally ingested nicotine and arecoline are seen as
efficacious anthelmintics in humans (Fabricant &
Farnsworth 2001). Thus, the widespread recreational
use of plants producing nicotine and arecoline could be an
evolved response to chronic infections of parasites (with
nicotinic or muscarinic receptors) in ancestral human
populations. However, we doubt that selection occurred
for use of nicotine or arecoline specifically; it appears more
likely that there could have been selection to seek out and
use cholinergic agents of various types.3 According to this
hypothesis, any pleasure or satisfaction from nicotine and
arecoline use stems not from incidental activation of a
general reward mechanism, but rather from an evolved
propensity for `human pharmacophagy' using these or
related cholinergic compounds. As in the case of
pharmacophagy by the parasitized tobacco hornworm,
our ancestors may have initially exploited plant neurotox-
ins because, although they are `bad' (toxic) for humans,
they are even worse for some human pathogens.
Currently, any potential benefits from the antihelmen-
tic properties of nicotine are outweighed by the consider-
able health costs of tobacco consumption in long-lived,
resource-rich Western populations with low parasite loads.
In the shorter-lived, nutritionally stressed populations
with higher parasite loads, such as those in which our
ancestors evolved, the antihelmentic properties of cholin-
ergic plant toxins may have constituted a significant
adaptive opportunity. These hypotheses are testable
using both descriptive and experimental methods in
animals and humans. Animal research could observe a
propensity for consuming cholinergic substances after
experimental infection with helminths. In humans,
observational research could describe associations
between consumption of cholinergic substances and
rates of helminth infections in natural populations.
Experimental studies could measure the effects of
cholinergic interventions on experimentally induced
(benign) helminth infections or, conversely, the effects of
manipulations of existing infection (e.g. by treatment with
commercial anthelmintics) on existing cholinergic sub-
stance use (e.g. tobacco use).
7. CONCLUSION
This paper has sought to illuminate the paradox between
evolutionary biology's punishment model and neurobiol-
ogy's reward model. Existing models of drug reward have
effectively bypassed the paradox by ignoring the evolved
function of plant drugs and the probable coevolution of
plant defensive compounds and herbivore nervous
systems. We have critiqued major assumptions underlying
the current evolutionary justification of reward models,
that: drugs are an evolutionary novelty; humans (and
mammals) are inherently vulnerable; and hedonic reward
best characterizes the psychological and physiological
responses to drug exposure. Our review has identified
several elements of research design that we believe would
constitute evolutionarily/ecologically plausible research of
substance use, including considering the possibility of
counter-exploitation of plant toxins in human evolution.
We have also provided an initial hypothesis that human
substance seeking may have evolved to exploit the anti-
parasitic properties of commonly used plant toxins, but
there are, of course, other possibilities.
In our opinion, resolving the paradox of human drug
use will require new neurobiological models, or new
interpretations of neurobiological reward theory, that are
consistent with insights from evolutionary ecology. More
generally, we urge neurobiologists studying drug use, and
evolutionary biologists studying plant­herbivore
interactions, to expand their research agenda to incorpor-
ate findings and insights from one another.

ENDNOTES
1Our arguments apply equally to evolved fungal defensive
compounds (e.g. psilocybin). Ethanol is the only commonly used
drug that is not a secondary compound and it therefore falls outside
the boundaries of our discussion. See Dudley (2002) for an
evolutionary account of ethanol use.
2The dynamic of co-evolutionary antagonism has several important
exceptions such as seed and pollen dispersal, and there is unlikely to
be much co-evolution between decomposers and degradable plant
detritus.
