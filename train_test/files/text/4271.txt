Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the relationship between effect-site concentration (CE
) of propofol during
total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) and cardiac systolic function using tissue Doppler imaging
(TDI) in patients undergoing cardiovascular procedures.
Methods: Stepwise increments of CE
of propofol of 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 mg/ml (modified Marsh
model) were achieved using a target-controlled infusion device. Transthoracic echocardiographic
assessments using TDI were performed for each CE
of propofol and corresponding systolic
myocardial velocity (s0), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and bispectral index
(BIS) were evaluated.
Results: Data from 31 patients were analysed in this prospective study. The s0 velocity decreased
with increasing propofol CE
and values recorded at propofol CE
3.0 and 4.0 mg/ml were near or
below 8 cm/s indicating abnormal cardiac systolic function. MAP, HR and BIS also decreased with
each propofol CE
increment.
Conclusion: Although the recommended dosage for propofol is up to 4.0 mg/ml, caution should
be taken when using propofol concentrations above 2.0 mg/ml during TIVA in patients with
underlying cardiovascular diseases.

Introduction
Propofol is a commonly used intravenous
agent for induction and maintenance of
anaesthesia because it has a rapid onset
and a short duration of action.1 However,
induction of anaesthesia with 2 mg/kg
propofol frequently causes a drop in
blood pressure (BP) secondary to decreased
systemic vascular resistance and cardiac
contractility, which may occasionally lead
to transient adverse events, especially in
patients with cardiovascular diseases.2
Furthermore, in patients with a low cardiac
output status, continuous infusion of a
relatively low-dose of propofol may result
in hypotension during induction of anaes-
thesia.3 The concentration of propofol
required for anaesthesia during surgery
ranges from 2.5 ­ 4.5 mg/ml1 and a concen-
tration of 2.0 ­ 4.0 mg/ml is usually recom-
mended during cardiovascular procedures.4
However, the effects of different concentra-
tions of propofol on cardiac systolic func-
tion have not been clarified, especially
in patients undergoing cardiovascular pro-
cedures who are expected to be at risk for
complications.3
Echocardiography is widely used for
the evaluation of cardiac systolic function.
In particular, tissue Doppler imaging (TDI)
is a relatively novel technique that measures
myocardial tissue velocities during
systole and diastole and reduces depend-
ency on left ventricular (LV) preload
change.5­7
It was hypothesized that determining
the optimal concentration of propofol for
anaesthesia that would not affect cardiac
systolic function may be beneficial in total
intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) where a
safe induction and maintenance of anaes-
thesia is required. Therefore, this present
study evaluated the relationship between
effect-site concentration (CE
) of propofol
and cardiac systolic function using TDI,
in patients undergoing cardiovascular
procedures.
Patients and methods
Study population
This was a single-centre, prospective study
that took place between January 2013 and
May 2014 at Konkuk University Medical
Centre, Seoul, Korea. Patients undergoing
general anaesthesia under TIVA for cardio-
vascular procedures were eligible for inclusion.
Exclusion criteria were: (i) age<18 years; (ii)
urgent or emergency cases; (iii) allergy to egg
or soybean oil; (iv) left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF) <40%; (v) regional wall
motion abnormality; (vi) atrial fibrillation.
The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Konkuk
University Medical Centre, Seoul, Korea
(approval no. KUH1160049) and registered
at http://cris.nih.go.kr (KCT0000635).
Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients.
Anaesthetic regimen and TDI
According to our institutional protocol,
anaesthesia was performed after all vasoactive
agents including dopamine and phenylephrine
had been prepared. The anaesthetic technique
was standardized. In brief, the patient arrived
at the operation room without premedication.
After establishing routine patient monitoring
(i.e. pulse oximetry, electrocardiography, non-
invasive BP monitoring and bispectral index
[BIS; a measure of the depth of anaesthesia]),
a radial artery was cannulated for continu-
ous invasive systemic BP monitoring. Pre-
oxygenation and de-nitrogenation were
achieved following eight breaths of maximal
inhalation and exhalation with 100% oxygen.
During induction of anaesthesia, each patient
was supplied with 100% oxygen via a tightly
fitted mask. Target end-tidal carbon dioxide
(CO2
) concentration was maintained, and
respiration parameters (i.e. tidal volume and
respiration rate) were checked. Intravenous
lidocaine (0.5mg/kg) was used to prevent the
pain induced by the propofol injection.

Transthoracic echocardiographic assess-
ments using TDI were performed using
a 5 MHz transducer (GE Healthcare,
Wauwatosa, WI, USA) as recommended in
guidelines.8 Pulsed wave TDI was evaluated
after obtaining an apical four-chamber view
with optimal gain and the best signal-to-
noise ratio. The sample volume was pos-
itioned at the left lateral ventricular wall
with the mitral valve annulus. Three dis-
tinctive velocities were recorded; upward
deflection during systole (systolic myocar-
dial velocity, s0) and two downward deflec-
tions corresponding to the early diastolic
phase (early diastolic myocardial relaxation
velocity, e0) and late diastolic phase (late
myocardial relaxation velocity with atrial
contraction, a0) (Figure 1). The s0 velocity
was measured for assessment of LV systolic
function.
All TDI assessments were performed by
the cardiac anaesthesiologist (S-H Kim) at
the end of the expiratory period to exclude
respiratory effects. A TDI assessment was
performed at baseline (i.e. CE
0.0 mg/ml)
after the lidocaine injection. Anaesthesia
was induced by administration of propofol
at an initial effect-site target concentration
of 1.0 mg/ml using a target-controlled infu-
sion device with a built-in modified Marsh
model (OrchestraÕ Base Primea; Fresenius
Vial, Bre
´ zins. France).9 A second TDI
assessment was performed 5 min after the
plasma concentration (CP
) and CE

propofol were equivalent. Further TDI
assessments were made 5 min after the CP
and CE
of propofol were equivalent for all
dose increases of propofol up to 4.0 mg/ml
(Figure 2). At the same time-points, mean
arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate
(HR) and BIS were also measured.
During the dose escalation of propofol,
assisted or controlled ventilation using a
face mask with 100% oxygen was used if
pulse oximetry fell below 95%. The tidal
volume, respiration rate and concentration
of end-tidal CO2
were maintained at the
same values as for spontaneous ventilation.
Crystalloid fluid was infused at 2 Â ideal
body weight (kg) ml/h throughout the entire
anaesthesia.10 In the event that MAP
decreased to <60 mmHg or HR fell to <40
beats per min (bpm), a vasoactive agent (i.e.
phenylephrine 30 mg or ephedrine 4 mg
[MAP <60 mmHg and HR <40 bpm], or
atropine [HR <40 bpm]) was administered
and the study was terminated to ensure
patient safety.
After all TDI assessments had been
completed, anaesthesia care was continued
by the attending anaesthesiologists until the
end of surgery.
Statistical Analyses
The CE
of propofol and the corresponding
TDI (s0 velocity), MAP, HR and BIS were
evaluated. The TDIs were evaluated by three
assessors, two were blinded observers
and one (S-H Kim) had also performed the
TDI assessments. To assess inter-observer
variability, the values of s0 according to CE
of propofol were analysed using the intra-
class correlation coefficient (ICC). The
ICC is an established statistic for assessing
measurement `reliability' and is defined
using variance components.11 The better
the agreement among assessors, the closer
the denominator is to the numerator and the
closer the ICC is to 1.0.
The primary outcome variable was s0 vel-
ocity. In a pilot study at our centre that
involved 10 patients undergoing general anaes-
thesia under TIVA for cardiovascular pro-
cedures, s0 velocity was 9.61Æ 1.89cm/sec.
Another study of non-anaesthetized patients
found that a cut-off limit for s0 velocity of 8cm/
sec differentiated between normal (!50%)
and below normal (<50%) LVEF.12 As it
was determined that a minimum difference of
20% in the values of s0 velocity between 0.0
and 4.0mg/ml CE
of propofol was clinically

and bispectral index (BIS) were evaluated 5 min after achieving the same plasma concentration (CP

significant, a sample size of 31 was estimated to
achieve a power of 0.9 and a value of 0.05.
Normality of the data was assessed by
the Kolmogorov­Smirnov test and if nor-
mally distributed the data were expressed as
the mean Æ SD or medians (interquartile
range) as appropriate. In all analyses,
P < 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical
significance.
All statistical analyses were performed
using the SPSSÕ statistical package, version
18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. The changes in TDI (s0 velocity),
MAP, HR and BIS according to CE
of
propofol were analysed by analysis of vari-
ance on ranks for repeated measurements
and Bonferroni's correction was performed
if values were statistically significant.
Results
Thirty-eight patients were enrolled in the
study. Seven patients could not be evaluated
up to CE
4.0 mg/ml and did not complete the
study. Therefore, the final analysis was
performed on 31 patients (Table 1).
The ICC values for inter-observer reli-
ability of s0 velocity assessments were 0.93
(95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88, 0.96),
0.84 (95% CI 0.73, 0.91), 0.94 (95% CI 0.89,
0.97), 0.93 (95% CI 0.88, 0.96) and 0.94
(95% CI 0.89, 0.97) for propofol CE
0.0, 1.0,
2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 mg/ml, respectively.
The s0 velocity decreased with increasing
propofol CE
(Table 2). With the exception of
the s0 velocity between 0.0 and 1.0 mg/ml and
between 3.0 and 4.0 mg/ml propofol CE
, all
comparisons between doses were statistic-
ally significantly different (P < 0.05 for all
comparisons). During the study period, no
new-onset regional wall motion abnormal-
ities were detected. MAP and HR showed
no significant differences between 0.0 and
1.0 mg/ml propofol CE
, but decreased sig-
nificantly with each propofol CE
increment
from 2.0 to 4.0 mg/ml (P < 0.05 for all com-
parisons). The BIS decreased significantly

Discussion
This present study evaluated cardiac sys-
tolic function by assessing the s0 velocity of
TDI parameters at the left lateral ventricu-
lar wall. The s0 velocity is less dependent on
preload, closely related to LVEF,13,14 and is
better correlated with ventricular contract-
ility compared with LVEF.13,15 The LV
wall is composed of three myocardial layers
with non-homogenous deformation creat-
ing multiple directed movements including
circumferential and longitudinal contrac-
tions.16 The subendocardial layer of the left
ventricle is mainly composed of longitu-
dinal fibres and has greater oxygen con-
sumption with less collateral blood flow
than the other layers.17 Therefore, the
subendocardial layer of the left ventricle is
vulnerable to ischaemia.18 Even in patients
with normal LVEF, s0 velocity values are
often low,19 but they provide early infor-
mation regarding abnormal longitudinal
systolic function well before any deterior-
ation in LVEF.6 The s0 velocity has been
reported to be a predictor of myocardial
perfusion defect20 and has been shown to be
useful in the detection of early abnormal-
ities in LV in patients with coronary artery
disease.21 Therefore, in our opinion mea-
suring the longitudinal contraction with s0
velocity is a valid parameter for assessing
early cardiac systolic dysfunction in
patients undergoing cardiovascular proced-
ures. Furthermore, the ICC statistic
showed that there was substantial inter-
observer reliability of the s0 velocity
assessments.
A previous study indicated that an s0
velocity below 8 cm/s suggests LV systolic
dysfunction.12 In the present study, at pro-
pofol concentrations of 3.0 and 4.0 mg/ml,
the s0 velocity was near or below
8 cm/s during cardiovascular procedures.
These observations indicate that propofol at
concentrations >2.0 mg/ml during TIVA
could induce deterioration of subendocardial
function in patients with underlying cardio-
vascular diseases even in those with normal
LVEF. Therefore, because patients undergo-
ing cardiovascular procedures are usually
susceptible to low BP and have a right-shift
in the autoregulation of coronary blood flow,
these current findings suggest that patients
showing an s0 velocity near or below 8 cm/s
with decreased MAP will require adequate
and timely treatment. The combination of
propofol as a hypnotic agent with remifenta-
nil as an analgesic agent is the most com-
monly used regimen for achieving
haemodynamic stability during TIVA.22
However, remifentanil has a limited effect
on myocardial contractility23,24 and may
induce hypotension with vasodilatation.1
Therefore, a combination of remifentanil
with propofol >2.0 mg/ml during TIVA may
cause significant haemodynamic deterior-
ation partly based on propofol-related longi-
tudinal cardiac systolic dysfunction as
observed in this present study.
Although there were no statistically signifi-
cant decreases in MAP, HR or s0 velocity as
propofol CE
increased from 0.0 to 1.0mg/ml,
BIS decreased with statistical significance.
This finding is in agreement with another
study where the effect of propofol on BIS was
shown to be more rapid than its effect on
systolic BP.25 Therefore, it appears that at the
onset of the effects of propofol on s0 velocity,
its effects on MAP, HR and BIS could differ
at the same CE.
The study was conducted at induction of
anaesthesia rather than under maintenance of
anaesthesia to confirm the true effects of the
different incremental increases of propofol CE
on the s0 velocity of the LV. If the study had
been conducted under maintenance of anaes-
thesia, assessing the true effects of propofol CE
would have been difficult because of various
confounding factors such as remifentanil,
vasoactive medications and ventilation-related
458 Journal of International Medical Research 44(3)
preload changes. Moreover, the incremental
increases of propofol CE
during maintenance
of anaesthesia may have decreased the values
of BIS to below the appropriate anaesthetic
depth with accompanying hypotension, which
would have required the addition of vaso-
active agents.3
The Marsh and Schnider models are
widely used as pharmacokinetic models for
propofol.9,26 In the present study, the mod-
ified Marsh model was used and it has a
central compartment volume of 0.228 ml/kg,
greater than the 4.27 l of the Schnider
model.9,26 Therefore, compared with the
Schnider model, the modified Marsh model
requires more propofol during induction
and maintenance of anaesthesia to sustain
the same CE
.9,26 The lower requirement of
propofol with the Schnider model may have
translated into a smaller decrement of s0
velocity. Therefore, the decline in s0 velocity
may differ according to the adopted phar-
macokinetic model for propofol.
The present study had several limitations.
First, patients with regional wall motion
abnormalities were not enrolled because it
was essential to include all segments of the
LV wall for precise evaluation of s0 velocity.
Further studies are required to access LV
contractility after propofol infusion in more
diverse segments of LV. Secondly, the meas-
urement of LVEF would have been helpful
to confirm the effect of propofol on cardiac
systolic function. Previous research has
reported good correlation between s0 vel-
ocity and LVEF.27,28 However, LVEF was
not measured in the present study because of
the risk of displacement of the echocardio-
graphic transducer induced by frequent
transducer moving in the simultaneous
measurement of s0 velocity. Research has
shown that transducer displacement can
result in the misalignment of the angle for
measuring TDI, which results in incorrect
values.29
In conclusion, the s0 velocity decreased as
propofol CE
increased from 0.0 to 4.0 mg/ml.
Importantly, propofol CE
3.0 and 4.0 mg/ml
were associated with s0 velocity near or
below 8 cm/s, which indicated cardiac sys-
tolic dysfunction. Therefore, although the
recommended dosage for propofol is up
to 4.0 mg/ml, caution should be taken
when using propofol concentrations above
2.0 mg/ml during TIVA in patients with
underlying cardiovascular disease.
