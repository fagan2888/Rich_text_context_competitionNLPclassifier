The Gap Gets Bigger: Changes
In Mortality And Life
Expectancy, By Education,
1981­2000
During a period of increased focus on disparities in health, virtually all
gains in life expectancy occurred among highly educated groups.
by Ellen R. Meara, Seth Richards, and David M. Cutler
ABSTRACT: In this paper we examine educational disparities in mortality and life expec-
tancy among non-Hispanic blacks and whites in the 1980s and 1990s. Despite increased
attention and substantial dollars directed to groups with low socioeconomic status, within
race and gender groups, the educational gap in life expectancy is rising, mainly because of
rising differentials among the elderly. With the exception of black males, all recent gains in
life expectancy at age twenty-five have occurred among better-educated groups, raising ed-
ucational differentials in life expectancy by 30 percent. Differential trends in smoking-
related diseases explain at least 20 percent of this trend. [Health Affairs 27, no. 2 (2008):
350­360; 10.1377/hlthaff.27.2.350]
Disparities in mortality and morbidity across U.S. educational
groups have been prevalent for decades. Attention to these disparities in-
tensified with Evelyn Kitagawa and Philip Hauser's comprehensive na-
tional account of educational mortality differentials in 1973, and a wave of related
disparities research followed.1 Heartened by early successes in the Healthy People
2000 initiative to reduce disparities in health care and health outcomes, the
Healthy People 2010 initiative aims to eliminate health disparities entirely by the
end of this decade. Groups such as the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and many pri-
vate organizations have also promoted this agenda.2 In 2003, the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) produced its first annual National
Healthcare Disparities Report to track racial and socioeconomic disparities in health
and health care.3

have been designed to address racial and socioeconomic disparities in health. Well-
known examples include the Medicare disproportionate-share hospital (DSH) pro-
gram ($12.9 billion annually) and the State Children's Health Insurance Program
(SCHIP) and related Medicaid expansions ($7 billion annually).4 In addition, much
of the $6.6 billion annual budget for the Health Resources and Services Administra-
tion (HRSA) targets disadvantaged populations via funding for community health
centers and the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE)
program for HIV/AIDS. The current wave of state initiatives to expand health insur-
ance coverage explicitly targets children and adults with low socioeconomic status
(SES). Finally, efforts to improve public health promotion and disease prevention
activities have expanded over time, with a particular focus on risk factors that are
prevalent among populations with low SES: tobacco use, obesity, and underuse of
preventive and screening services.5
n Recent research. Recent research on racial disparities demonstrates mortal-
ity gains for blacks relative to whites during the 1990s, but data on education-related
disparities in mortality are not comprehensive.6 Most research measuring such dis-
parities ends in the 1980s. These studies show widening differences in mortality by
education attainment.7 Many of the programs noted above postdate that era, how-
ever. More recent evidence focuses on area-level disparities.8 But major migration
and demographic changes mean that area-level analyses may understate or overstate
the full extent of health disparities at the individual level. Another large study after
1990 pools data from 1959 through 1996, making it difficult to attribute trends to a
single decade.9 Furthermore, analyses of death by cause can augment our under-
standing of education-related disparities in mortality because some causes of death
are more amenable to intervention than others, suggesting different policy ap-
proaches to ameliorate disparities.10
In this study we analyzed life expectancy and mortality trends by education
group and then estimated which diseases account for differential trends.
Study Data And Methods
n Data sources. We used two different sources of data to estimate mortality
trends. We matched census population estimates to death certificate data in the
Multiple Cause of Death (MCD) files for 1990 and 2000.11 The nearly universal sam-
ple of deaths makes the MCD attractive, but there are questions about the accuracy
of education reporting on death certificates.12 To validate these data and to assess an
earlier time period, we used the National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS),
which followed members of the March Current Population Survey (CPS) through
subsequent deaths. The CPS data span 1981­85 and 1991­95, and deaths span 1981­
88 and 1991­98.13 The initial CPS sample is noninstitutionalized. For this reason,
mortality rates in the NLMS are below those in the MCD, which includes all deaths.
We restricted analyses to non-Hispanic blacks and whites, to limit the impact of im-
migration on our estimates.14

n Measures of education. NLMS and U.S. census respondents report educa-
tion, while informants, usually next of kin, report education on death certificates.
Previous studies document some inconsistencies between these methods--in par-
ticular, overstatement of high school graduation relative to incomplete high school
experience on death certificates.15 As a result, we chose two broad categories of edu-
cation where agreement is high: low education, which refers to twelve or fewer years
of education; and high education, which indicates at least thirteen years of school-
ing. This cutoff yielded the following shares of high-education people in our study:
47.3 percent in 1990 and 54.5 percent in 2000 using census data, and 43.9 percent in
1981­88 and 56.1 percent in 1991­98 in the NLMS.
Because rising educational attainment over time could affect our results, we re-
computed estimates after equalizing the shares in the high- and low-education
groups. We did this by randomly reassigning some people with twelve years of ed-
ucation to the high-education group in the early period to match education shares
in the latter period. The patterns we documented are robust to the changing com-
position within education groups.16
n Mortality rates and life expectancy. For a given age-race-sex-education
group (for example, white low-education women ages 65­74 in 1990), we divided
the number of deaths by the group's population to compute age-specific mortality
rates. These were calculated for ages 25­84, since most education is completed by
age twenty-five and few NLMS participants survived beyond age eighty-four. To in-
corporate mortality after that age, we assigned published death rates within age-
sex-race groups.17 Period life expectancy was then constructed in the usual way.18
For 1990 and 2000 we estimated cause-specific mortality rates based on the five
leading causes of death: diseases of the heart, cancers, cerebrovascular diseases,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and unintentional injuries.19 Be-
cause ample evidence implicates tobacco use as the underlying cause for a sub-
stantial portion of deaths, we distinguished lung cancer from other cancers, yield-
ing six cause-of-death categories.20
n Analyses. We computed life expectancy by education both within race-sex
groups and for the entire study population, holding race and sex composition con-
stant at year 2000 shares. We also calculated age-standardized mortality rates using
ten-year age strata with the year 2000 population standard. The changes in these
rates from 1990 to 2000 were decomposed by cause of death and age group.21 We
computed standard errors for 1990, 2000, and changes over time using the Delta
method, and NLMS variance estimates accounted for the complex survey design.22
Lastly, given the importance of causes of death for which smoking is a risk factor, we
computed the sex-specific, age-adjusted share of the adult population (age twenty-
five and older) reporting that they were "current smokers" for selected years be-
tween 1966 and 2002, in the annual National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) from
various years.

Study Findings
n Life expectancy. Between the 1980s and 2000, life expectancy increases oc-
curred nearly exclusively among high-education groups (Exhibit 1). Comparing
1981­88 with 1991­98, life expectancy at age twenty-five grew 1.4 years for high-
education people but only 0.5 years for low-education people--a difference of 0.9
year (p = 0.014). Between 1990 and 2000, life expectancy grew 1.6 years for the high-
education group but remained unchanged for the low-education group (p < 0.001 for
the difference). As expected, life expectancy in the MCD data was lower than in the
NLMS data because of the inclusion of the institutionalized population. In both
data sets, education-related gaps in life expectancy increased by about 30 percent.
This similarity is striking, given the differences in sampling frames and education
measures between the sources. Further, the levels of the education differences are
large. In 2000, life expectancy for a twenty-five-year-old with a high school diploma
or less was fifty years. For a person with some college, life expectancy was nearly
fifty-seven years.
n Life expectancy by race and sex. Widening educational disparities in life
expectancy do not arise from increased race or sex differences in mortality trends.
Our population estimates hold demographics constant at their 2000 level. More fun-
damentally, Exhibit 2 shows similar trends within each race and gender group. The
growing educational gap in life expectancy was most pronounced among women,
regardless of race. Life expectancy at age twenty-five declined among less-educated
black and white women while rising one year or more for more-educated women. By
2000, highly educated women could expect to live more than five years longer than
their less-educated counterparts, in both races. For white men the gap was 7.8 years
in 2000, up 1.6 years from 1990, and for black men it was 8.4 years, up 1.3 years.
Overall and even within-race trends in mortality by education mask another

important trend. Although SES differences in mortality were rising, mortality dif-
ferences across sexes and races were falling. From 1990 to 2000, the life expec-
tancy differences between blacks and whites decreased 1.8 years for low-educa-
tion males, 1.5 years for high-education males, and 0.7 and 0.6 years for low- and
high-education females, respectively. Life expectancy for low-education white
males increased in both the NLMS and MCD data, while it decreased for females.
Within the high-education group, life expectancy increased for both men and
women, but the gains for men were almost double those for women. Gaps in mor-
tality by race and sex persist, but they are smaller now than they were in the 1980s.
n Condition-specific contributors to rising education gaps. Diseases of the
heart, cancers, and COPD contributed more than 60 percent of deaths in the sample
in 1990 and 2000 in all race and gender groups. Heart diseases and cancers exclud-
ing lung cancer contributed most to rising education differentials, 32 percent. Lung
cancer and COPD, two diseases largely attributable to tobacco use, accounted for 21
percent (Exhibit 3). These diseases were particularly salient among less-educated
white women over age forty-five, among whom lung cancer and COPD contributed

about 25 percent of rising educational gaps in mortality.23 By 2000, lung cancer and
COPD death rates were twice as high among low-education white men and women
and black men, compared to the more educated in these groups (Exhibit 4).
n Age-specific contributors to rising education differentials. Increased edu-
cation differentials among the elderly account for much of the growing gaps in mor-
tality and life expectancy. Within each race-gender group, at least half of the growth
in life expectancy gaps and more than 60 percent of the growth in mortality gaps
come from those age sixty-five or older.24 In contrast, trends among adults ages 25­
44 contributed little to growing gaps in mortality, and among black men ages 25­44,
education-related mortality gaps narrowed during 1990­2000. Among the causes of
death we examined, the narrowing educational differential among black men ages
25­44 was driven by unintentional injuries and heart disease deaths.25
n Smoking rates over time. Adult smoking rates have declined greatly since the
mid-1960s (Exhibit 5). Among men, the reduction in smoking prevalence was rela-
tively even by education, although somewhat greater for the better-educated. Be-
tween 1966 and 1995, rates dropped twenty-two percentage points among the better
educated versus eighteen percentage points among less-educated men (Exhibit 5),
despite the fact that better-educated men already had lower smoking rates in 1966.
Smoking among women increased from 1966 through the late 1970s and then
began to decline (Exhibit 5). The decline from 1979 through 1995 was twelve per-
centage points among the better-educated and five percentage points among the
less-educated. The sharp divergence in smoking rates by education occurred be-
tween 1979 and 1983, coincident with the first surgeon general's report highlight-
ing smoking risks for women.26 Over the entire period, smoking among female col-
lege attendees declined by more than sixteen percentage points, compared with
only 7.5 percentage points among less-educated women (data not shown).

Discussion
The 1980s and 1990s were periods of rapidly rising life expectancy, but the mor-
tality declines that yielded these gains did not occur evenly by education group.
On average, we find very little change in life expectancy among less-educated
black and white non-Hispanics and very substantial increases in life expectancy
among the more educated. These patterns mirror similar widening of education
differentials in disability and self-reported health status over the same period.27
The growing gap in life expectancy by education occurred during a period of in-
creasing attention to health disparities and increased public spending designed to

improve the health of less-advantaged populations.
One important exception to this pattern is that education-related mortality
disparities narrowed among young black men, a finding consistent with recent ev-
idence that race-related mortality gaps narrowed in the 1990s. Nevertheless, a
five-year gap in life expectancy between blacks and whites remains.28 In terms of
gender, men made faster gains in mortality than women over this period, narrow-
ing gender-related mortality and life expectancy gaps.
n The income factor. Our data span a period of rapidly rising income inequality,
providing one potential explanation for widening education disparities. However,
data do not support this explanation because health disparities narrowed across
race and sex as inequality increased.29
n The smoking factor. Our results suggest that differential trends in smoking
may explain a large part of widening gaps in mortality and life expectancy. The dis-
eases contributing most to the growing education gap in mortality include diseases
of the heart, lung and other cancers, and COPD, all of which share tobacco use as a
major risk factor. Lung cancer and COPD alone account for one-quarter of the in-
creasing gap in life expectancy for women over age forty-five, consistent with their
sharp divergence in smoking rates during the 1980s. For men, the divergence in
smoking rates was more moderate, as was the increase in the mortality gap attribut-
able to tobacco-related causes of death.
Public policy designed to reduce health consequences related to smoking might
have indirectly contributed to this disparity. In the half-century since the harms of
smoking became widely known, tobacco control measures have proliferated. Cig-
arette labels warning of the health hazards of smoking have been required since
1966. Cigarette advertising was banned from television and radio in 1971.30 During
the 1980s and 1990s, many states and localities instituted smoking bans in the
workplace. By 1993, 70 percent of indoor workers had smoking bans in work, and

by 2007, every state had some smoke-free air provision.31 In addition, cigarette
taxes have increased rapidly in recent years, after falling in real terms in the 1970s.
On net, the real price of cigarettes has nearly tripled since the 1960s.32
The proliferation of tobacco control policies brought remarkable reductions in
tobacco use. In the four decades following the 1964 surgeon general's report, per
capita annual consumption of cigarettes among adults fell by half. However, de-
clines were greatest among the most-educated groups. The growing education-
related gap in mortality for smoking-related causes supports the long-standing
paradox that prevention can widen disparities in health across education and in-
come groups.33 In this case, the advances are related to knowledge about risk-fac-
tor control; we cannot say whether the same is true about medical technologies.34
n Other efforts to reduce disparities. The focus on tobacco does not imply that
other efforts to reduce disparities in health were not successful. Indeed, we confirm
recent work highlighting relative gains in life expectancy overall for blacks com-
pared with whites during the 1990s.35 Further, other studies have shown that
Medicaid expansions targeting low-income children and pregnant women im-
proved their health outcomes.36 Our study does not argue that these policies were
unsuccessful. Rather, it suggests that these efforts were swimming against a strong
tide, one that overwhelmed billions of dollars spent annually on additional medical
care. On a more positive note, our results suggest that one place to look for real prog-
ress is tobacco control efforts for low-SES groups because mortality trends mimic
trends in smoking that occurred decades earlier. These long-run consequences of
health behavior bolster the argument for early childhood intervention.37
n Why differential smoking trends? The explanation for differential smoking
trends is complex. Basic knowledge does not appear to be the major issue. In 1986,
90 percent of Americans surveyed across the board reported that smoking causes
lung cancer and emphysema, and 80 percent believed that it contributed to heart
disease and bronchitis.38 Translating knowledge into action has proved more com-
plex, however. Innovations that target less-advantaged groups might offset this un-
intended consequence of medical progress. Some caution about this conclusion is
needed, however. Without addressing the underlying factors that lead less-edu-
cated people to be less able or willing to invest in better health, measures to reduce
smoking may simply lead to a shift from tobacco-related deaths to other causes.39
n The obesity factor. Beyond the differential change in smoking, there is the na-
tional trend toward increased obesity. As with smoking, obesity is more common
among the less-educated than among the better-educated. Further, recent research
suggests that obesity might contribute to nearly as many deaths as tobacco does.40
Although the population health consequences of obesity remain controversial, the
obesity trends into the future could further widen socioeconomic gaps in health.
In summary, during a period of increased focus on disparities in health, virtu-
ally all gains in life expectancy occurred among highly educated groups. Causes of
death related to differential trends in cigarette smoking by education have con-

tributed greatly to rising mortality differentials. Larger and better-targeted efforts
to push successful health interventions into less-educated groups may be needed
to achieve the goal of reducing socioeconomic disparities in health.
