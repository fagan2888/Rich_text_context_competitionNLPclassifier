Objective. Previous literature suggests that increases in the medical use of opioids over the early
1990s did not contribute to increased morbidity secondary to opioid abuse. Our objective was to
evaluate the period 1997­2001 to analyze trends in medical use and medical abuse of three classes
of opioid analgesics that are commonly used in sustained-release formulations: fentanyl, morphine,
and oxycodone.
Design and Setting. A retrospective analysis of the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) data-
base and the Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) database for the
years 1997­2001 was used for this study.
Results. The analysis of the DAWN database showed that there was an 83.5% increase in all opioid
analgesic mentions from 1997 to 2001. Mentions involving any fentanyl compound increased
249.8%, any morphine compound increased 161.8%, and any oxycodone-containing compound
increased 267.3%. Mentions of each of these three classes of opioids remained less than 2% of all
total drug mentions per year for each year studied. Medical use of the selected opioid classes, as
reported in the ARCOS database and measured by grams distributed, all increased substantially
(fentanyl 151.2%, morphine 48.8%, oxycodone 347.9%).
Conclusion. Using this method of analysis, the rates of drug abuse, and resultant morbidity
secondary to the use of opioid analgesics, remain low in spite of the increase in medical use of these
substances.

Introduction
The adequate treatment of chronic pain
remains a major public health concern. It has
been suggested that 40­80% of patients with
cancer pain experience inadequate pain manage-
ment [1]. This statistic is bothersome when one
considers that current pain medicine specialists
suggest that as many as 90% of patients with
cancer pain may be effectively treated with present
pharmacological therapies [2]. Chronic nonmalig-
nant pain also continues as a significant problem
throughout the industrialized world, with a
reported prevalence of 10­55%, depending on the
definition used to characterize this disorder [3].
The treatment of chronic pain is complicated
by evidence that nonmedical use and abuse of pre-
scription opioids are rising in the United States.
The National Survey on Drug Use and Health,
which was formally called the National Household
Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA), reported that 2
million people in the United States aged 12 and
older used a prescription opioid for nonmedical
use for the first time in the year 2000 [4,5]. This
number was approximately four times the value
reported per year in the mid 1980s. The NHSDA
also reported that survey questions pertaining to
prescription opioid dependence yielded data that
indicated a significant increase (P < 0.05) from
443,000 persons meeting the criteria for this dis-
order in 2000 to 656,000 in 2001 [4,5].
In April 2000, Joranson et al. analyzed the
trends of use and potential drug abuse of five major
classes of opioid analgesics--morphine, fentanyl,
oxycodone, hydromorphone, and meperidine [6].
The methodology they employed was a compari-
son of mentions of each class of opioid, using the
Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) data-
base, to the trends of cumulative distribution
of grams of these opioid classes, using the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration's Automation
of Reports and Consolidated Orders System
(ARCOS) database, over a period from 1990­1996.
Those authors' results included the finding that, as
measured by the DAWN system, opioid analgesics
were responsible for a small proportion of emer-
gency department (ED) visits due to drug abuse
during the period studied. The proportion of men-
tions of opioid abuse relative to the total number of
reports of drug abuse actually decreased from 5.1%
to 3.8% over the 7-year period, and all of the
classes of opioids studied had a decline in mentions
in the DAWN database except for morphine,
which increased by 3.2%. The mentions of all five
classes of drugs compared with the total mentions
were less than 1% for each year studied. These
findings all occurred as the trends in medical use of
four of the five classes of opioids in both total dis-
tribution and grams, adjusted per population,
increased (meperidine showed a decrease). The
authors concluded that "the trend of increasing
medical use of opioids to treat pain does not appear
to contribute to increases in the health conse-
quences of opioid analgesic abuse" [6].
Can today's health care provider continue to
draw this same conclusion, or has newer data
revealed other trends of special importance in
opioid prescriptive patterns? This is of special
concern to generalists, who see the vast majority of
the aging population that is experiencing chronic
pain. The aim of this study is to conduct an analy-
sis similar to that done by Joranson et al. to provide
a more recent comparison of trends of medical use
and possible abuse of opioid analgesics.
Methods
Given that there has been an increased availabil-
ity of sustained-release opioids to treat severe pain
during the period since the previous study
(1990­1996), the decision was made to evaluate
the three major classes of these compounds--
oxycodone, morphine, and fentanyl--currently
used by generalists to treat chronic pain.
The DAWN database was used as the source for
trends in drug abuse. This data source, which is
sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) of the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
is described in detail in the original Joranson et al.
article [6]. All statistical information involving the
incidence of drug abuse used for this analysis was
obtained using the SAMHSA website [7].
DAWNtracesdrug-relatedEDepisodesthrough
retrospective examination of medical records. It is
not a measure of prevalence of drug use in a popu-
lation [8]. It may be more accurate to describe it as
a measure of drug-related morbidity and mortality
[9]. The 2001 DAWN report describes itself as a
probability sample of hospitals designed to produce
representative estimates of ED drug episodes and
drug mentions for the coterminous United States
and 21 metropolitan areas [8].
Drug episodes include ED visits that are
induced by or related to the use of illegal drugs or
the nonmedical use of legal drugs in patients aged
6­97 years. Drug mentions refer to drugs men-
tioned per episode. There may be up to four drugs
mentioned per episode, with an average of 1.8
drugs mentioned per episode in 2001. Multidrug
episodes were reported 56.2% of the time during
that year. Drugs reported are divided into two
major categories. "Major substances of abuse"
includes the most common illicit drugs reported
to DAWN (cocaine, marijuana, and heroin) and
alcohol reported in combination with other sub-
stances. (Alcohol is not recorded unless it is used
in combination with another substance.) "Other
substances of abuse" includes generic classifica-
tions of drugs that are prescription or over-the-
counter preparations. The three categories of
drugs studied fall into this category. Substances
referred to as narcotic analgesics in DAWN pub-
lications have been renamed opioid analgesics for
this analysis. It is extremely important to note that
DAWN publications acknowledge that estimates
from the database may not be used to make direct
estimates of drugs marketed under trade names, so
all conclusions made from estimates are at best,
trends of classes of substances mentioned.
Examples of the types of drug episodes reported
include drug-induced suicide attempts, nonlethal
drug overdoses, withdrawal episodes requiring
60 Novak et al.
ED attention, or undesired drug reactions [10].
DAWN data are attractive to researchers because
the nonmedical use of legal drugs is included in
the database. Unfortunately, information as to
whether the drug was obtained by a legal pre-
scription method, or by drug diversion, is not
included. Information regarding how the drug was
ingested is also not included.
Data from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Admin-
istration's ARCOS database were again used to
analyze trends in the medical use of opioids.
Manufacturers and distributors of Schedule I, II,
and III narcotic materials, and selected Schedule
III and IV psychotropic drugs, are required to
report commercial distribution to hospitals, retail
pharmacies, practitioners, midlevel practitioners,
and teaching institutions under this system [11].
The data are intended for use in identifying the
diversion of controlled substances. All information
used for this analysis involving the medical use of
opioids was obtained from the U.S. Department
of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration's
ARCOS retail drug summary website [12]. Infor-
mation used for this analysis includes reports of
the three drug compounds in grams distributed
and grams per 100,000 population. It is important
to note that information was not provided on this
website for compounds containing fentanyl or
morphine for the year 2000.
To aid in the interpretation of the ARCOS data,
grams per 100,000 population values were also
adjusted for equivalency, with morphine as the
reference standard. For example, with respect to
potency, 30mg of sustained-release morphine is
equivalent to 20mg of controlled-release oxy-
codone, or a 25-mg transdermal fentanyl patch
[13,14]. For our analysis requiring equivalency
conversion, grams of opioid substance distributed
per 100,000 population was adjusted by a conver-
sion factor. Oxycodone grams per 100,000 popu-
lation were multiplied by a factor of 1.5 and
fentanyl grams per 100,000 population were mul-
tiplied by a factor of 100. The fentanyl conversion
factor was calculated by first using the fact that
a 25-mg/hour fentanyl patch delivers 1,800mg of
drug over a 72-hour period. This is an equivalent
dose of approximately 30mg sustained-release
morphine every 12 hours, or 180mg in 72 hours
(the standard dosing period of a fentanyl patch).
Results
DAWN ED mentions and percentages of DAWN
ED mentions to total drug abuse mentions for
major classes of drug substances for the years 1997
and 2001 are listed in Table 1. There were
1,165,367 drug mentions in the DAWN database in
2001. Opioid analgesics were mentioned 99,317
times (8.5% of total mentions). To allow for further
comparison, Table 1 includes the percentage
increase of these substances over the time range of
study (1997­2001). Total drug mentions increased
by 23.7%. Total opioid mentions increased by
83.5%, which is a larger percentage increase than
for the three major substances of abuse (cocaine
19.8%, marijuana 70.8%, and heroin 31.6%).

Table 2 gives DAWN ED mentions for the
specific opioids analyzed in our study (fentanyl,
morphine, and oxycodone) as raw numbers and
as percentages of total mentions per year. Dawn
ED data delineates mentions of the drugs analyzed
in this study according to mentions of the sub-
stance alone and in combination with another
drug, and this information is reflected in the
table. Fentanyl and morphine single-compound
mentions were essentially the same as those in
combination, so those compounds were not sepa-
rated. Once again, it is important to note that
any estimate made by this method cannot be
attributed to drugs marketed under particular
brand names. For further analysis, the percent
change of mentions over the 5-year time period is
also included.
There were large percentage increases for the
opioid classes analyzed (oxycodone 267.3%, mor-
phine 161.8%, and fentanyl 249.8%), but all three
classes of drugs continued to account for less than
2% of total mentions in 2001.
The largest percentage increase in mentions for
a drug compound studied were those mentions
associated with oxycodone-only compounds
(2,883.9%). This is in contrast to all oxycodone
mentions (single compound and in combination
267.3%), oxycodone with acetaminophen men-
tions (66.2%), and oxycodone with aspirin men-
tions (­58.5%). It is important to note that, while
there was a percentage increase in the number of
mentions over the time period studied, the per-
centage of mentions to total mentions remains low
for all compounds, including those that contain
oxycodone only.
Trends in the medical use of the opioids studied
are listed in Table 3. The largest percentage
increase is noted for oxycodone-containing com-
pounds. It is important to remember when ana-
lyzing these data that fentanyl is approximately
100 times more potent than morphine and that
fentanyl usage is currently similar on a unit-dosage
basis to the other long-acting opioid compounds.
Figure 1 allows for a comparison of trends in
abuse of the compounds studied. Grams per
100,000 population, as listed in Table 3, were first
adjusted for equivalency, as described in Methods.
Total mentions for compounds (both as single
drugs and in combination with other substances),
as listed in Table 2, were divided by these adjusted
values. The figure shows that oxycodone-containing
compounds had the greatest number of mentions
per grams per 100,000 population as adjusted for
equivalency for all years. There was a decrease in
mentions per grams until 1999, when there was an
upturn.

Discussion
ARCOS data indicate that there has been a sub-
stantial increase in retail distribution of oxy-
codone, morphine, and fentanyl over the period
1997­2001. This, hopefully, is an indication that
progress is continuing in the improvement of pain
management. Since the original Joranson et al.
study [6], there have been multiple national con-
sensus statements published about the use of
opioids for chronic pain, as well as task force meet-
ings and study groups to study this issue [15].
The data analyzed in this study suggest that
opioid analgesics continue to be a small part of drug
abuse as measured by the DAWN system. As
Joranson et al. originally noted, abuse levels, as
reflected by this database, have remained low in
spite of the greater availability of these substances.
These data are consistent with those reported
for the Treatment Episode Data Sets (TEDS) in
the year 2000 [16]. Only 1.6% of admissions to
treatment centers reported in that database were
attributed to "opiates other than heroin." This
classification included nonprescription use of metha-
done, codeine, morphine, oxycodone, hydromor-
phone, meperidine, opium, and other drugs with
morphine-like effects. In fact, the National Drug
Intelligence Center has stated that, "The illegal
abuse of pharmaceuticals, medicinal drugs legally
available by prescription or over the counter, is the
lowest threat among major drug categories" [17].
On the other hand, total opioid analgesic abuse
has continued to rise as evidenced by total number
of mentions (83.5%) and percentage of total
mentions (from 5.7% to 8.5%, an increase of
48.4%). The large percentage increase in men-
tions of compounds containing oxycodone alone
(2,883.9%) also cannot be ignored.
There are many limitations to a study using this
methodology. Joranson et al. mentioned problems
with the DAWN database itself, including the fact
that the system obviously underreports the true
extent of drug abuse as it only reports admissions
to an ED. Caulkins et al. have also extensively
critiqued the DAWN database [18]. One particu-
lar area of concern is that there are numerous
factors that influence ED usage that can vary over
location and time. The SAMHSA is aware of the
concerns about the limitations of the DAWN
system and has developed a new design that will
be implemented in the field in 2003 [19].
Another concern of the DAWN system of col-
lection is that suicide attempts are included in the
total numbers of mentions [20]. As there have
been a substantial number of reports of psychiatric
comorbidity, and especially depression, in patients
with drug abuse problems, there remains a ques-
tion as to whether the use of the controlled
substance is actually related to abuse or to a psy-
chiatric disorder.
A final limitation is that we are unable to iden-
tify any specific drug by brand name using this
methodology. The analyses simply allow for an
overview of trends in abuse and use of classes of
drugs that are available in sustained-release
formulations.
There are multiple areas of further research
suggested by this analysis. The effect of the exten-
sive media focus in the lay literature on opioid
use and abuse on provider prescribing patterns of
these substances is an area that should be exam-
ined. This analysis should also examine the effect
of the media on a patient's willingness to accept
opioids for the treatment of chronic pain. The
effect of Drug Enforcement Agency reactions to
the potential of "escalating abuse and diversion"
of prescription opioids is also an area that may
provide insight into government regulatory influ-
ence on health care provider treatment regimens
[21]. The reasons that opioid use has increased,
and for what classes of patients, are important
potential areas of research, at least in part, to
measure our successes and shortcomings in pain
management. Finally, there continues to be a need
to design better methods of determining the actual

cially that of opioids in their use for chronic pain

Conclusion
How then does one address the question of
whether the trend of increasing use of opioids to
treat pain contributes to increases in opioid anal-
gesic abuse and related morbidity? Prescription
opioid abuse continues, as measured by the
DAWN system, and this abuse is growing. This
increase in prescription opioid abuse is substanti-
ated by other epidemiologic data sources such as
the NHSDA. This trend in increased opioid abuse
has been accompanied by a large number of media
reports that have often been sensational [22,23].
These reports have fueled physician fears about
increased addiction potential as well as potential
governmental investigation of prescribing prac-
tices involving controlled substances [15,24].
There is tremendous concern that these reports
could potentially undo advances that have been
made in improvement in chronic pain control. To
avoid the possibility of this occurrence, the health
care system must continue to provide education
about pain control and addiction. At the same time,
diversion control programs must continue to strive
to improve detection of opioid abuse without
interfering with their appropriate medical use.
