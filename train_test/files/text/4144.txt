Abstract
Objective: Cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer, 61 (CYR61) is a key gene in the transforming growth
factor-b signalling pathway, which is involved in the development of many tumour types. This study
aimed to clarify the status and clinical significance of CYR61 expression in patients with ovarian
epithelial carcinoma.
Methods: Tissue from patients with ovarian epithelial carcinoma or benign ovarian tumours were
investigated retrospectively for CYR61 expression at mRNA and protein levels, using reverse
transcription­polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Correlations
between immunohistochemical scores and several clinicopathological parameters were
investigated.
Results: In 50 patients with ovarian epithelial carcinoma and 50 patients with benign ovarian
tumours, CYR61 expression on mRNA and protein levels was significantly higher in ovarian
epithelial carcinoma tissue than in benign ovarian tissue. CYR61 expression was associated with
regional lymph node metastases and progression of clinical disease stage. There was no difference
in CYR61 expression between patients aged <50 years and !50 years.
Conclusions: CYR61 expression was significantly upregulated in ovarian carcinoma tissue
compared with benign ovarian tumour tissue samples. Protein CYR61 levels were associated
with lymph node metastases and Union for International Cancer Control stage. Protein CYR61
may be useful in targeted diagnosis and therapy, for patients with ovarian epithelial carcinoma.

Introduction
Ovarian epithelial carcinoma, which
accounts for 90% of ovarian cancer cases,
continues to be the leading cause of death
among gynaecological malignancies.1 Over
two-thirds of cases are not diagnosed until
the disease has spread beyond the ovaries,
due to the asymptomatic nature of early
stage disease.2,3 The development of novel
biomarkers4 for early detection of ovarian
epithelial carcinoma is therefore essential to
improve the survival of patients with this
disease.
Cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer, 61
(CYR61) encodes protein CYR61, which
belongs to the connective tissue growth
factor, CYR61 and nephroblastoma over-
expressed (CCN)1­6 family, and has been
implicated in diverse biological processes
such as cell adhesion, migration, angio-
genesis and wound healing.5,6 CYR61 is
an important gene in the transforming
growth factor-b (TGF-b) signalling path-
way and it can be activated by thrombos-
pondin-1 through its interaction with
latent TGF-b binding proteins. This inter-
action results in activation of TGF-b so
that it can bind to its receptors, thus
stimulating the Smad pathway.7,8 Smad
proteins can bind to protein CYR61,
which leads to transcription of CYR61,
and activation of angiogenesis and tumour
growth.9,10 CYR61 expression can, there-
fore, play a key role in growth and
development, and is critically involved in
the development of some tumours.11,12
CYR61 expression has been shown to be
significantly higher in Barrett's oesopha-
geal adenocarcinoma tissue than in
Barrett's oesophageal tissue with no sign
of cancer.13,14 The significance of CYR61
expression and prognosis in ovarian
epithelial cancer, however, remains
uncertain.
The present study aimed to explore
CYR61 expression and determine whether
protein CYR61 could be a prognostic factor
in ovarian epithelial carcinoma. Expression
of CYR61 in ovarian epithelial carcinoma
was investigated by immunohistochemical
staining. In addition, the relationship
between CYR61 expression and clinico-
pathological parameters in patients with
ovarian epithelial carcinoma was
investigated.
Patients and methods
Study population and sample collection
Patients with primary ovarian epithelial
carcinoma and patients with benign ovar-
ian tumours, treated at the Department of
Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Second
Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun,
China between December 2011 and
March 2013, were included in this retro-
spective study. Patients with a previous or
secondary malignancy, or who had previ-
ously undergone chemotherapy or radio-
therapy treatment, were excluded from the
study. Clinicopathological information was
collected from the data held in records for
the patients diagnosed with ovarian epi-
thelial carcinoma. Tumours were staged
according to the tumour­node­metastasis
staging system of the Union for
International Cancer Control (UICC; 5th
edition).15
All patients received standard surgery
as appropriate, to provide maximal
tumour resection. For each patient, a
sample of ovarian tissue had been fixed
in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin
wax and cut into 4 -mm thick serial sec-
tions for immunohistochemical staining;
a second sample had been snap-frozen
at ­80C for subsequent total RNA isola-
tion; methodologies are described fully
below.
This study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Second Hospital, Jilin
University. Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants.

RNA preparation and semiquantitative
RT­PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the frozen
ovarian tissue samples using TRIzolÕ
reagent (InvitrogenTM, Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. In short, the
tissue, frozen at ­80C was ground using
a pestle and mortar. 100 mg of ground
tissue was then incubated with 1 ml
TRIzolÕ reagent for 5 min at room tem-
perature. Cell debris was removed by cen-
trifugation at 12 000 g for 10 min at 4C
and 0.4 ml chloroform was added. The mix
was then vortexed, followed by incubation
for 5 min at room temperature. The phases
were separated by centrifugation at 12
000 g for 15 min at 4C and the aqueous
phase was transferred to a new tube.
0.6 Â volume isopropyl alcohol and
0.1 Â volume 3 M sodium acetate were
added to this aqueous phase and incubated
for 10 min at 4C. The precipitated RNA
was pelleted by centrifugation at 12 000 g
for 15 min at 4C and, following removal
of the supernatant, the RNA was washed
twice with 70% ethanol. The RNA was
dried and resuspended in 30 ml of diethyl-
pyrocarbonate-treated water. Using 1 mg
mRNA as the template, single-stranded
cDNAs were generated using 1 ml (200 IU)
SuperscriptÕ II reverse transcriptase
(InvitrogenTM) according to the manufac-
turer's instructions. Polymerase chain reac-
tion (PCR) amplification of the cDNA was
conducted using the following CYR61
primer sequences: sense, 50-
ACTTCATGGTCCCAGTGCTC-30; anti-
sense, 50-AAATCCGGGTTTCTTTC
ACA-30. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase was amplified as the inter-
nal control using the following primers: 50-
TG TGGGCATCAATGGATTTGG-30,
reverse: 50-ACACCA TGTAT
TCCGGGTCAAT-30 (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). PCR
was performed using the premix EX TaqÕ
Version 2.0 mix (Takara, Dalian, China).
Briefly, the qPCR was performed in 10 -ml
reactions containing 4 ml of cDNA and 5 ml
SYBRÕ Green Master Mix (Takara), and
1 ml of 100 mM stock primer mix. The PCR
conditions were 94C for 3 min, followed
by 32 cDNA amplification cycles of 40 s at
94C, 45 s at 61C and 1 min at 72C, with
a final extension period of 5 min at 72C.
PCR products were separated by electro-
phoresis at a constant voltage of 2 V/cm in
a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel. Images were
captured using a Gel Print 2000i visual
graphics array (BioImage Products, Ann
Arbor, MI, USA) and the integrated den-
sities value was analysed using Motic
Images Advanced, version 3.2 image ana-
lysis software (Motic, Hong Kong, China).
Immunohistochemistry assay
To detect CYR61 expression and localiza-
tion of protein CYR61 in ovarian tissue,
immunohistochemistry was performed using
a streptavidin­peroxidase immunohisto-
chemical staining kit (Tiangen; Beijing,
China) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. In short, ovarian tissues were
fixed in 10% buffered formalin, dehydrated
in ethanol, embedded in paraffin wax and
cut into 4 -mm thick sections for use in
immunohistochemistry analyses. Sections
were deparaffinized in xylene and rehy-
drated with graded alcohols. For heat-
induced epitope retrieval, sections were
immersed in 0.01 M citrate buffer solution
(pH 6.0) and pressure cooked for 10 min (the
pressure of this step was not constant).
Sections were then cooled for 1 h at room
temperature, then washed in water and
0.01 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS;
pH 7.2). Hydrogen peroxide (0.3%) was
302 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
applied to block endogenous peroxidase
activity and the sections were incubated
with normal goat serum at 37C for 2 h to
reduce nonspecific binding. Sections were
then incubated overnight at 4C with pri-
mary rabbit antihuman CYR61 (polyclonal;
1 : 25 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA), then washed three
times in 0.01 mM PBS (pH 7.2) for 5 min.
Secondary biotinylated goat antirabbit
serum immunoglobulin G 1 : 200; Tiangen
Biotech, Beijing, China) was added at 37C
for 2 h. After washing 3 times in 0.01 mM
PBS (pH 7.2), sections were stained using
the ImmunoCruzTM ABC staining system
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the colour
was developed with diaminobenzidine,
according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions. The immunohistochemical staining
was evaluated at Â 100 and Â 400 magnifi-
cations using an Olympus BX51 light micro-
scope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan).
PBS was used in place of the primary
antibody as a negative control.
The level of immunoreactivity was
assessed according to a semiquantitative
method16 and was measured using a
scale between À and þþþ, where À repre-
sented no immunostaining; þ represented
<25% cells reactive; þþ represented 25­
50% of cells reactive; þþþ represented
>50% of cells reactive. Scores of À and þ
were considered to be negative; scores of þþ
and þþþ were considered to be positive.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed with
SPSSÕ software, version 13.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) for WindowsÕ. Student's
t-test was used to compare means between
two groups. The relationships between
CYR61 expression and clinicopathological
variables (including age, UICC stage and
presence of lymph node metastasis) in
patients with ovarian epithelial carcinoma
were examined using V2-test. Data were
presented as mean Æ SD and n (%) inci-
dence. P values <0.05 were considered to be
statistically significant.
Results
This study included 50 patients with ovarian
epithelial carcinoma (mean age, 51.23 Æ 2.1
years) and 50 patients with benign ovarian
tumours (mean age 50.4 Æ 1.9 years). There
were no significant between-group differ-
ences in terms of mean age (Student's t-test).
Semiquantitative RT­PCR analysis
showed that levels of CYR61 mRNA were
significantly increased in ovarian epithelial
carcinoma tissue compared with benign
ovarian tumour tissue (P < 0.05; Figure 1).
Protein CYR61 immunoreactivity in
ovarian tissue appeared as fine, granular to
diffuse cytoplasmic and membrane staining
(Figure 2). Positive immunohistochemical
staining for protein CYR61 (i.e. þþ or
þþþ staining intensity) was detected in
tissue samples from 35/50 (70 %) patients
with ovarian epithelial carcinoma; these
levels of staining were significantly higher
than those seen in the benign tumour group
(13/50 [26.0 %] patients; P < 0.05).
The association between CYR61 expres-
sion and various clinicopathological factors
associated with ovrarian epithelial carcin-
oma (including patient age, presence of
lymph node metastasis and clinical stage),
was examined (Table 1). Patients with lymph
node metastasis were found to exhibit sig-
nificantly higher CYR61 expression levels
than those with no metastasis (P < 0.001).
CYR61 expression levels were also found to
be higherin patients with clinical stageIII­IV
carcinoma compared with stage I­II disease
(P < 0.001; Table 1). There was no difference
in CYR61 expression between patients aged
<50 years and patients aged !50 years.

Discussion
The present study investigated expression of
the CYR61 gene in ovarian tissues from
patients with ovarian epithelial carcinoma or
benign ovarian tumours. Levels of CYR61
expression were significantly upregulated in
the ovarian epithelial carcinoma group com-
pared with the benign tumour group at both
an mRNA and protein level. Furthermore,
in the patients with ovarian epithelial car-
cinoma, significant associations were identi-
fied between levels of protein CYR61 and
UICC stage and lymph node metastasis,
suggesting that CYR61 expression may be
involved in disease pathogenesis.
Protein CYR61 is a secreted, heparin-
binding and extracellular matrix-associated
angiogenic inducer belonging to the CNN1­
6 family, which regulates cell adhesion,
migration, proliferation and differentiation,
and is involved in tumour growth.5,6
Research shows that CYR61 may be
regarded as both a suppressor and a pro-
moter of cancer progression and tumour
invasion.14,17 Studies have shown that
CYR61 can suppress carcinogenesis in non-
small cell lung cancer or gastric carcin-
oma.17,18 However, other studies have
shown that CYR61 can enhance carcinogen-
esis.19­21 The findings that CYR61 enhances
tumour growth in a gastric adenocarcinoma
cell line, RF-1, and in breast cancer cell
lines,19­21 are consistent with results of the
present study, in which CYR61 expression
levels were increased in patients with ovarian
epithelial carcinoma compared with those
with benign tumours, and upregulation of
protein CYR61 was significantly associated
with lymph node metastases and UICC
stage. These results suggest that the level of
CYR61 expression may be associated with
the malignant potential of ovarian epithelial
carcinomas.
In conclusion, the present retrospective
study demonstrated that CYR61 expression
was significantly upregulated in ovarian
carcinoma tissue compared with benign
ovarian tumour tissue, and that upregula-
tion of protein CYR61 was significantly
associated with presence of lymph node
metastasis and UICC stage III­IV disease,
in patients with ovarian epithelial carcin-
oma. The present study findings suggest that
CYR61 may play a key role in the develop-
ment of malignant tumours.
