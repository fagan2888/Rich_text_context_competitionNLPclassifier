OBSERVATIONS
Internal Carotid
Artery Occlusion
Detected With
Nonmydriatic
Fundus Photography
A case report
Diabetic retinopathy is one of the major
complications of diabetes, and it is
the most common cause of blindness.
Following the recommendation of the
management guidelines for type 2 dia-
betes, we have established a routine screen-
ing for diabetic complications in our clinics
(1). Although nonmydriatic fundus pho-
tography was widely used for screening of
diabetic retinopathy, less attention has
been directed toward the correlation
between asymmetric retinopathy (i.e., more
advanced retinopathy in one eye and no
retinopathy in the other) and carotid artery
disease. Here, we are reporting on a diabetic
patient with asymptomatic internal carotid
artery (ICA) occlusion who presented with
significantly asymmetric retinopathy found
by nonmydriatic fundus photography in
our routine screening clinic.
A 59-year-old man with a known his-
tory of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and
dyslipidemia for 10 years was regularly
followed up in our hospital. Routine
screening with nonmydriatic fundus pho-
tography found asymmetric retinopathy
with hemorrhagic and cotton wool spots in
the left eye and no retinopathy in the right
eye ground.(Fig. 1). After noting this find-
ing, we asked the patient about possible
neurological symptoms. Only mild vision
deterioration in the left eye was noted in
the past 10 days. Because it did not hinder
his daily life, he had not paid attention to
the condition. He denied any other motor,
sensory, or visual disturbances. There was
no history of cigarette smoking, alcohol
consumption, or previous surgical opera-
tion. On physical examination, his height
and weight were 170 cm and 69 kg,
respectively. His blood pressure was
138/90 mmHg, with a regular pulse and
no carotid bruit or heart murmur. Exami-
nations of the chest and abdomen pro-
duced normal results. No pitting edema
was found in the extremities, the distal cir-
culation was intact, and the bilateral
ankle/brachial index was 1.06/1.06. No
remaining evidence of any other neurolog-
ical deficits was noted during normal sen-
sory examinations and measurements of
deep tendon reflexes and muscle power.
The laboratory studies revealed a
hemoglobin level of 13.4 g/dl, a platelet
count of 258  109/l, fasting plasma glu-
cose level of 175 mg/dl, a postprandial
plasma glucose level of 153 mg/dl, HbA1c
value of 6.9%, a creatinine level of 0.8
mg/dl, total cholesterol level of 275 mg/dl,
triglyceride 690 mg/dl, and urinary albu-
min excretion count of 30­300 mg/g creati-
nine. We further performed a carotid ultra-
sound examination, and found total occlu-
sion of the left ICA and mild plaque in the
right ICA (Fig. 2). After weighing the risk of
stroke during medical management versus
the risks of surgery, the patient was pre-
scribed aspirin 650 mg/day for antiplatelet

therapy, buflomedil 150 mg 3 times a day
for reducing risks of myocardial infarction,
stroke, and oral hypoglycemic antihyper-
tensive lipid-lowering agents.
Atheromatous lesions were found to
be present in the ipsilateral arteries of 88%
of patients presenting with retinal
ischemia, and there was a trend toward
higher incidence of more severe lesions on
the ipsilateral side (2,3). Asymmetric
retinopathy occurs in 5.2­10.1% of dia-
betic patients with proliferative diabetic
retinopathy (PDR) (4­6). Although the
incidence of severe carotid artery disease
was only 0.8­20% (4,7), we learned from
this case and other studies that reported
that even in asymptomatic patients,
significant ipsilateral carotid occlusion dis-
ease is an important risk factor for asym-
metric pre-PDR and PDR (7).
It is estimated that more than 2 million
Americans have 50% stenosis of the
carotid artery without being aware of any
attendant symptoms (8), and carotid artery
stenosis accounts for 20% of occlusive
strokes in the carotid distribution (9). Our
patient's asymptomatic ICA occlusion was
found unexpectedly by routine screening
with nonmydriatic fundus photography
because of the presence of significantly
asymmetric retinopathy. We therefore
strongly recommend searching for underly-
ing lesions in cases of asymmetric diabetic
retinopathy (including pre-PDR and severe
PDR). We suggest that both carotid vessels
should be examined routinely in patients
with asymmetric diabetic retinopathy.

Effectiveness of a
Diabetes Education
Program Adapted
for People With
Vision Impairment
The rising prevalence of people with
vision impairment associated with dia-
betes (estimated between 570,000 and
2.3 million affected individuals) requires
adapted diabetes education services (1­3).
The availability of diabetes programs deliv-
ering these services is limited. A compre-
hensive program for people with both
diabetes and vision impairment enabled
participants to master self-care skills,
such as administration of insulin injec-
tions and blood glucose monitoring (4­6).
We evaluated the outcomes of this program
extended to a more diverse population over
a 10-year period.
From 1989 through 1998, visually
impaired participants were referred to the
St. Louis University Health Sciences Cen-
ter. Diabetes educators specializing in
adaptive diabetes techniques met with the
individuals to 1) assess visual function,
2) evaluate and update general diabetes
knowledge, and 3) assist in the selection of
appropriate self-management devices. The
number and content of the sessions varied
according to the level of preexisting dia-
betes knowledge and time needed for
acquisition of self-care skills.
Assessment of visual function was
obtained from medical records as well as
from direct questioning about the subjects
ability to read standard and large-print
materials, their need for special lighting,
and their ability to recognize large objects
or subtle details. Before introducing adap-
tive self-care skills, the educators provided
instructions in basic diabetes knowledge
and self-care. Visual function and manual
dexterity were taken into consideration
when choosing the most appropriate adap-
tive devices among the available options.
Adaptive equipment included syringe
magnifiers, syringe loading devices, and
glucose monitoring systems with speech
capability and tactile aids for proper
blood sample placement (7­10). Subjects
returned for final follow-up after procuring
their own equipment. Demonstration of
proficient self-care technique was consid-
ered a successful outcome. The protocol
was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of St. Louis University.
Data were analyzed by nonpaired tests
and one-way analysis of variance, with sub-
group analysis performed by the method of
the Newmann-Keuls post hoc test. Compar-
isons of proportions were performed by 2
tests. All data are described as means ± SD.
There were 163 participants. The par-
ticipants' mean age was 55.9 ± 14.5 years,
the duration of diabetes was 17.5 ± 9.8
years, and the duration of vision impair-
ment was 5.5 ± 9.2 years. There were 28
people with type 1 and 135 with type 2
diabetes. There were 43 men and 120
women; 36% were African-American and
64% were white. There were 99 subjects
who had "early" visual impairment
(defined as legal blindness with some
retained functional vision) and 64 subjects
had "late" visual impairment (defined as
light perception only or total blindness).
There were 112 participants (72%)
who succeeded in learning the specialized
techniques. Five refused training, 1 had a
stroke, and 1 was lost to follow-up. Those
who were successful were younger (53.9 ±
14.0 years of age) compared with those who
were unsuccessful (61.0 ± 14.9 years of age,
P = 0.006). When the population was
divided into quartiles by age distribution,
those in the highest quartile (66 years of
age [53%]) were the least successful in mas-
tering the skills (2 9.8, P = 0.02). Those
DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 23, NUMBER 9, SEPTEMBER 2000 1431
Letters
with late visual impairment had a poorer
success rate (57%) compared with those
with early visual impairment success rate of
81% (2 10.3, df = 1; P = 0.001). There was
an overall trend for poorer success with
both advanced age and advanced visual
impairment (r = 0.95, P = 0.05) (Fig. 1).
Before the program, 49 people were
attempting to manage their diabetes by
themselves, 89 required the help of a fam-
ily member, and 18 required professional
home health care. The latter group, who
were predominantly in the fourth age
quartile, had the poorest success rate.
In conclusion, this adaptive diabetes
education program demonstrated effective-
ness in restoring independent diabetes self-
care practices among a diverse population.
Those individuals least likely to succeed
were the elderly with the most advanced
degree of vision impairment. Even so,
approximately half of the elderly were able
to complete the program successfully.
Younger individuals with advanced stages
of vision loss were less likely to be deterred.
Individuals with early visual impair-
ment were more successful in completing
the program, suggesting that reliance on
remaining vision may have facilitated acqui-
sition of self-care skills. Early intervention in
the course of vision loss may empower the
individual with confidence and self-reliance
to maintain learned skills as the vision loss
progresses.
National standards for diabetes educa-
tion do not emphasize rehabilitative train-
ing and self-care techniques (11,12). How-
ever, an adaptive diabetes self-care program
allows individuals the opportunity to par-
ticipate in their diabetes management with
the same expectations as their sighted peers
(7,9). This leads not only to improved self-
reliance and quality of life, but also allevi-
ates the burden on the family and the home
health care system (13). With appropriate
instruction, independent self-care is possi-
ble for the majority of individuals, includ-
ing many elderly people and those with the
severest degrees of vision loss.
All diabetes educators should have an
understanding of the resources available
for visually impaired patients. The cost of
acquiring all necessary adaptive demon-
stration devices may be prohibitive for pri-
vate offices and smaller centers (19). How-
ever, all major diabetes programs should
function as regional referral centers, offer-
ing the appropriate demonstration devices
and trained educators.

Which Screening
Test Is the Best for
Gestational
Impaired Glucose
Tolerance and
Gestational Diabetes
Mellitus?
The glucose challenge test (GCT) has
been widely adopted as a screening
test for gestational diabetes mellitus
(GDM). However, because the test is quite
labor-intensive, some researchers have
investigated other less complex screening
methods. Reichelt et al. (1) recently
demonstrated that fasting glucose levels
predict gestational impaired glucose intol-
erance (GIGT) with a sensitivity of 81%
and a specificity of 49% when using a
threshold of 4.5 mmol/l. So far, there has
been no study to compare the prediction
of GIGT with other less laborious tests.
Therefore, we examined several screening
tests in the prediction of GDM and GIGT
and determined the optimal cutoff thresh-
old for each screening method.
A total of 1,031 pregnant women were
recruited from the prenatal clinic at the
Prince of Wales Hospital. A 50-g GCT was
scheduled between 24 and 28 weeks of
gestation. Plasma spot glucose was mea-
sured before the test and all patients were
scheduled to have a 75-g oral glucose tol-
erance test (OGTT) 2­4 weeks thereafter,
regardless of the initial GCT results. A
blood sugar series that included fasting,
2-h postbreakfast, 2-h postlunch, 2-h
postsupper, and midnight plasma glucose
measurements was also performed either
immediately before or 1 week after the
OGTT. Plasma fructosamine was also mea-
sured during the blood sugar series. A
total of 942 (91.4%) women completed
the study after the initial recruitment. Glu-
cose intolerance (GIGT and GDM) was
diagnosed in 122 subjects (13.0%). The
diagnostic criteria of GDM and GIGT
were based on the recommendations of
the World Health Organization (2). The
accuracy of predictions of GDM/GIGT
using the 1-h GCT, fasting plasma glu-
cose, spot glucose, postbreakfast glucose,
and plasma fructosamine values were
compared by receiver-operator character-
istic (ROC) analysis using the test devised
by DeLong et al. (3).
There were 706 (68.5%) nulliparous
and 325 (31.5%) multiparous women. Of
these women, 734 (71.2%) were older than
25 years and 152 (14.7%) had a BMI 27
kg/m2. There were 145 (14.1%) women
with a family history of diabetes and 15
(1.5%) women with a previous macro-
somic baby. Only 1 patient (0.1%) had a
previous history of GDM. The incidence of
glucose intolerance was significantly higher
in women who were 25 years of age,
were obese, or had a family history of dia-
betes; the odds ratios were 2.64 (95% CI
1.554.51), 1.71 (1.072.73), and 1.79
(1.112.88), respectively. There was no
significant increase in incidence among
those with a previous macrosomic baby.
Each of the areas under the ROC
curves for the GCT (0.773, SEM 0.025),
fasting glucose (0.766, SEM 0.026), and
2-h postbreakfast glucose levels (0.743,
SEM 0.025) were significantly greater than
that for random spot glucose and plasma
fructosamine measurements. The areas
under the curves were not significantly
different among the GCT, fasting glucose,
and 2-h postbreakfast values.
The optimal cutoff values were 7.0,
4.1, 5.0, and 4.7 mmol/l for the 1-h GCT,
fasting glucose, 2-h postbreakfast, and
spot glucose, respectively. The selection of
the cutoff value is guided by the Youden
index, which is, in general, a compromise
between the sensitivity and the specificity.
As we were looking for a good screening
test, the highest Youden index in which
the sensitivity was 70% was selected.
If the policy of selective screening cur-
rently recommended by the American
Diabetes Association (ADA) (4) were
adopted, the number of blood tests could
be reduced by 23%. However, the sensitiv-
ity would drop to 65.6, 64.8, and 63.1%
for the GCT, fasting glucose, and 2-h post-
breakfast tests, respectively, using the cut-
off values previously determined. If selec-
tive screening were performed according
to the ADA recommendation of using the
GCT cutoff of 7.8 mmol/l, a sensitivity of
only 50% would be achieved.
Therefore, our findings support recom-
mendations to offer universal screening to
high-risk ethnic groups. Furthermore, the
GCT has several disadvantages over the
more convenient use of a fasting glucose or
postbreakfast value, which have similar pre-
dictive values. Hence, we propose to discon-
tinue the use of this nonphysiological test.
Although both fasting and postbreakfast
glucose levels performed as well as GCT in
the prediction of GIGT and GDM, fasting
glucose is more convenient administratively,
as it does not require timed blood collection.
Therefore, we recommend the use of fasting
glucose to replace the GCT as a screening
test for GIGT and GDM.

betes, primarily as a result of acceleration of
atherosclerosis and increased thrombosis
(1). One of the early signs in the develop-
ment of atherosclerosis is endothelial dys-
function; abnormal endothelial function has
been observed in patients with conditions
predisposing to the development of athero-
sclerosis, including diabetes (2). The mech-
anisms of endothelial dysfunction in dia-
betic individuals are not known, but there is
strong evidence that inactivation of nitric
oxide by increased oxygen-derived free rad-
icals could be responsible. There are studies
in humans that show that abnormal
endothelial function in type 2 diabetes has
been restored by treatment with antioxi-
dants, e.g., ascorbic acid (3). Women with a
history of gestational diabetes mellitus
(GDM) represent a group of individuals
who have insulin resistance and increased
risk to develop type 2 diabetes later in life
(4). We have recently shown that these
women have markedly abnormal endothe-
lial function, even in the presence of normal
glucose tolerance (5). Because ascorbic acid
improves endothelial function in patients
with type 2 diabetes, we hypothesized that
abnormal endothelium-dependent vasomo-
tor function in such subjects in a prediabetic
state might be improved by ascorbic acid.
Seventeen women with a history of
GDM (mean age 36 ± 3.9 years) randomly
selected from a cohort of women, in whom
endothelial dysfunction has previously
been reported (5), were enrolled in this
study. Ten of these women were nonobese
(BMI 23.5 ± 1.9 kg/m2) and 7 were obese
(BMI 34.3 ± 5.1 kg/m2). All of the women
were otherwise healthy nonsmokers who
were not taking any medication at the time
of the study. Basal insulin resistance was
calculated using homeostasis model assess-
ment (6). Each subject was assessed dou-
ble-blindly on 2 visits, 3­6 months after
delivery. On day 1, baseline flow­mediated
dilatation of the brachial artery was esti-
mated (7), and 2 g ascorbic acid (Cebion,
Merck, Germany) or similarly appearing
placebo tablets were given orally; 2 h later,
flow-mediated dilatation and nitrate-
induced dilatation were estimated. It is
known that oral ingestion of 2 g ascorbic
acid normally leads to plateau plasma lev-
els after 2 h; these remain elevated for 5 h
after ingestion. In addition, the 2-g dose
produces a significant increase in plasma
ascorbic acid levels within the physiologi-
cal range. This dose and timing were thus
selected, as previously recommended (8).
One week later (day 2), measurement of
baseline flow­mediated dilatation of the
brachial artery was repeated and the oppo-
site treatment (placebo or ascorbic acid)
was administered; 2 h later, flow-mediated
dilatation and nitrate-induced dilatation
were assessed. Measurements obtained at
baseline, after ascorbic acid, and after
placebo, were compared by analysis of
variance for repeated measurements with
Newman-Keuls post hoc test comparison
of group mean values. Statistical signifi-
cance was taken at a P value 0.05.
Fasting glucose concentration, glyco-
sylated hemoglobin, and oral glucose tol-
erance tests were all within normal range.
Administration of ascorbic acid had no
effect on heart rate, blood pressure, resting
blood flow, resting artery diameter, and
the degree of reactive hyperemia. Ascorbic
acid resulted in a significant improvement
of endothelium-dependent flow-mediated
dilatation from 2.6 ± 2.7 to 9 ± 3.3%,
whereas there was no improvement after
placebo administration (3 ± 2.3 to 2.6 ±
1.9%) (P  0.05). Regarding the possible
effects of ascorbic acid on arterial smooth
muscle cell function, sublingual nitroglyc-
erin produced arterial dilatation that was
similar in the ascorbic acid and placebo
groups (24 ± 9.3 vs. 22.8 ± 6%, NS), indi-
cating the absence of a beneficial effect of
ascorbic acid on smooth muscle cell
response to nitric oxide.
These findings suggest that ascorbic
acid improved nitric oxide bioavailability in
conduit arteries in response to hyperemic
flow in women with previous GDM; the
scavenging of free radicals and reduction of
the oxidative stress explain the improve-
ment observed after administration of
ascorbic acid. We have recently shown (5)
that women with previous GDM have
markedly abnormal endothelial function
that is independent of obesity; an interest-
ing possibility is that endothelial dysfunc-
tion in this setting could be related to the
chronic insulin resistance known to charac-
terize this group. A positive correlation
between basal vascular endothelial nitric
oxide production and insulin sensitivity has
been reported in healthy individuals (9),
suggesting a direct physiological link
between endothelial function and insulin.
An interesting finding in our previous work
(5) was an inverse correlation of serum uric
acid levels and flow-mediated dilatation,
indicating that oxidative stress in women
with previous GDM plays a role in the
pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction. It
is known that activation of the xanthin/xan-
thinoxidase system causes generation of
vascular oxygen radicals, which results in
reduction of endothelium-dependent vaso-
dilatation, because xanthinoxidase also
generates uric acid; elevated serum uric
acid levels appear to be a marker of
increased oxidative stress (10). Nitric oxide
is inactivated by oxygen-derived free radi-
cals, particularly superoxide anion, leading
to endothelial dysfunction (11). Ascorbic
acid is an effective antioxidant, which has
the ability to scavenge excess superoxide
anions and thereby decrease nitric oxide
inactivation (12).
In conclusion, oral ingestion of ascor-
bic acid acutely improves endothelial dys-
function observed in women with previ-
ous GDM, suggesting that oxygen-derived
free radicals may play a role in the patho-
genesis of abnormal endothelial function
in these women. Restoring endothelial
function may have important implications
for reducing the risk of atherosclerosis in
these subjects. Further studies examining
the effects of the long-term administration
of ascorbic acid on endothelial vasomotor
activity will be required before vitamin C
supplementation can be recommended in
women with previous GDM and abnormal
endothelial function.

Assessment of
Insulin Sensitivity
From a Single
Sample
Comparison of homeostasis
model assessment (HOMA) and
Ln(HOMA) with minimal model
analysis
Assessment of insulin sensitivity pro-
vides a basic understanding about
common metabolic disorders. Vari-
ous methods have been proposed to eval-
uate insulin sensitivity in vivo. The eugly-
cemic clamp study and minimal-model
analysis (MINMOD) are the standard
methods of estimating insulin sensitivity,
but the procedures are rather complex and
expensive (1­3). There is a need for sim-
ple indexes that assess insulin sensitivity
from a single sample at diabetes clinics
and in large-population studies. The
insulin resistance index assessed by home-
ostasis model assessment defined as the
product of fasting plasma insulin and glu-
cose divided by 22.5 (HOMA-IR) is an
estimation of insulin sensitivity from a sin-
gle sample (4). Matthews et al. (4) demon-
strated that HOMA-IR is closely correlated
with insulin resistance index assessed by
euglycemic clamp (clamp IR) in type 2
diabetic patients. This estimation is suit-
able for large-population studies. Very
recently, Emoto at al. (5) and Bonora et al.
(6) also reported that HOMA-IR and log-
transformed HOMA-IR (Ln[Homa]) pro-
vided a good correlation in the clamp
studies. In the present study, we applied
MINMOD during frequently sampled
intravenous glucose tolerance tests to
compare the estimates of insulin sensitiv-
ity with HOMA-IR and Ln(HOMA).
We examined 103 Japanese subjects
with normal glucose tolerance (NGT),
impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and type 2
diabetes to assess insulin sensitivity. Glu-
cose intolerance was diagnosed based on
the criteria of the World Health Organiza-
tion (7). The BMI of the subjects with NGT,
IGT, and type 2 diabetes were 13.4­38.3,
17­39.3, and 17.2­25.3 kg/m2, respec-
tively. MINMOD-derived insulin sensitivity
index (SI) was estimated as previously
described (8­10). The statistical analysis
was performed with the StatView 5 system
(Berkeley, CA).
We observed a significant correlation
between HOMA-IR and MINMOD SI in all
of the subjects examined in this study (r =
0.45, P  0.0001). Because visual inspec-
tion suggested a hyperbolic relationship
between HOMA-IR and SI, we also ana-
lyzed the correlation of Ln(HOMA) with SI.
Ln(HOMA) correlated more strongly with
MINMOD SI than did HOMA-IR per se (r =
0.61, P  0.0001). To investigate the rea-
son why HOMA-IR and Ln(HOMA) show
differences in correlation coefficients, we
analyzed the relationship of HOMA-IR and
Ln(HOMA) with SI across the range of
HOMA-IR. We divided the subjects into 3
groups according to the HOMA-IR values
(HOMA-IR: 1, from 1 to 2, and 2). The
relationship of HOMA-IR and Ln(HOMA)
with MINMOD SI is shown in Table 1.
There was only a slight difference between
the correlation coefficients of HOMA-IR
and Ln(HOMA) with MINMOD SI when
the HOMA-IR was 1 (r = 0.49, P  0.005
vs. r = 0.49, P  0.005). There was also
only a slight difference between the correla-
tion coefficients of HOMA-IR and
Ln(HOMA) with MINMOD SI when the
HOMA-IR was between 1 and 2 (r = 0.40,
P  0.01 vs. r = 0.37, P  0.05). In con-
trast with HOMA-IR values 1 and from 1
to 2, the correlation coefficient becomes
higher and the P value becomes significant
when HOMA-IR is log-transformed in sub-
jects with HOMA-IR 2 (r = 0.33, P = 0.10
vs. r = 0.49, P  0.05). Because the HOMA-
IR value is a product of blood glucose and
insulin levels, it is possible that the estimates
are slightly exaggerated and the values are
scattered to a wide range, compared with
the standard estimates MINMOD SI when
the metabolic status of each individual
increases both glucose and insulin levels.
There is a frequent need of assessing
insulin sensitivity for clinicians during the
diet, exercise, and/or drug therapy. In addi-
tion, HOMA-IR is a widespread index of
insulin sensitivity and a simplified evalua-
tion without exaggeration as a number is

necessary (11,12). When the subjects are
examined whose metabolic circumstances
cause the value of HOMA-IR to increase,
the log-transformed HOMA will be a better
prediction of insulin sensitivity.

Prevalence of
Glucose Intolerance
Among Malays
in Brunei
In newly industrialized countries, dra-
matic changes in economy and lifestyle
may result in changed eating habits,
reduced physical activity, and increased fre-
quency of obesity. These changes appear to
lead to metabolic abnormalities, such as
glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, dys-
lipidemia, hypertension, and obesity. As a
consequence, type 2 diabetes, heart disease,
and stroke have become major causes of
mortality in many of these countries (1).
In Brunei (North Borneo), the socioe-
conomic development and the increase in
wealth over the last 3 decades have led to
rapid modernization processes. During
this time, Bruneians, particularly the ethnic
group of Malays who constitute the major-
ity (75%) of the population, have adapted
to an affluent lifestyle resulting from West-
ern influences. Among other things, this
new lifestyle has been characterized by a
change in diet and very little exercise.
Previous publications have indicated
that a relatively high prevalence of glucose
intolerance correlates with the level of
social development in this area. In West
Malaysia, Malays with an urban lifestyle
have been reported to show a considerably
higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes com-
pared with Malays living a more rural way
of life (8.2 vs. 2.8%, respectively) (2). Like-
wise, Malays in Singapore showed a rela-
tively high prevalence of type 2 diabetes
(9.1 and 6.1%, men and women, respec-
tively) (3). These observations emphasized
the need for assessing the risk of glucose
intolerance among Bruneian Malays.
We performed an oral glucose toler-
ance test on 100 randomly chosen
Bruneian Malay volunteers between 25­55
years of age (57:43, men:women). Our
selection criteria were ethnic origin and age,
whereas the exclusion criteria were preg-
nancy, cancer, treatment with oral steroids,
recent surgery, and recent serious illness.
Venous blood (10­20 ml) was collected just
before the glucose challenge (75 g glu-
cose/300 ml H2
O) and 30, 60, 90, and 120
min afterward. Using the diagnostic criteria
of the World Health Organization and the
National Diabetes Data Group, we classified
each subject as having normal glucose tol-
erance, impaired glucose tolerance, or type 2
diabetes. Serum insulin levels were mea-
sured with an immunoradiometric assay
not susceptible for proinsulin cross-reactiv-
ity (Medgenis, Fleurus, Belgium), and
serum C-peptide measurements were
determined with a radioimmunoassay (Bio-
lab/Serone, Milan, Italy). Statistical analysis
of the insulin and C-peptide response to
oral glucose was based on one-way analysis
of variance with repeated measurements
followed by post hoc Tukey's test.
We observed that 13.5% of the total
group was impaired glucose tolerant and
6.5% was type 2 diabetic. Only the dia-
betic subjects showed increased fasting
serum insulin and C-peptide levels. How-
ever, both diabetic and impaired glucose-
tolerant subjects revealed a delayed insulin
and C-peptide response to oral glucose
and a significantly prolonged exposure to
elevated serum insulin and C-peptide lev-
els during the 2-h testing period. The
prevalence of glucose intolerance in rela-
tion to age was found to be 15, 19, and
25% in the groups 25­34, 35­44, and
45­55 years of age, respectively.
In addition, we determined weight,
height, waist and hip circumference, and
fat distribution based on bicep, tricep, sub-
scapular, and suprailium skin-fold mea-
surements with a caliper. Anthropometric
1436 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 23, NUMBER 9, SEPTEMBER 2000

classification of the subjects according to
the percentage of body fat (%BF) indicated
that 54% of all male subjects and 96% of
all female subjects were overweight or
obese. Alternatively, classification accord-
ing to BMI revealed that 53% of all men
and 56% of all women were overweight
(BMI 25­30 kg/m2) or obese (BMI 30
kg/m2). Remarkably, we found that 42.5%
of the women who were classified as over-
weight or obese based on %BF showed a
BMI 25 kg/m2. Of all female subjects,
67.5% showed a waist-to-hip ratio 0.8. A
combination of a relatively high %BF and a
high waist-to-hip ratio has been shown to
be related to upper body obesity, which is
considered a major risk factor linked to dia-
betes and cardiovascular disease (4). The
specific phenomenon of too much central
body fat, even in women with a BMI 25
kg/m2, has been found in Vietnamese (5)
and Chinese (6) women as well.
This cross-sectional study represents
the first population-based data collection
on the prevalence of glucose intolerance
among the Malay inhabitants of Brunei, and
it indicates a high frequency of type 2 dia-
betes and impaired glucose tolerance.
Although we cannot exclude a predisposi-
tion for glucose intolerance in Bruneian
Malays, environmental factors, such as diet
and physical activity, might contribute to
the development of a multifactorial disease
such as type 2 diabetes. Our results support
previous findings on diabetes epidemiology
in newly industrialized countries.

Frequency and
Patients' Reported
Awareness of
Diabetic Retinopathy
Among Type 2
Diabetic Patients
Admitted to Internal
Medicine Wards
Although diabetes is one of the major
causes of blindness, diabetic retinopa-
thy can be prevented in most cases
(1­8). While successful treatment is depen-
dent on early intervention, irreversible
damage has often already occurred before
symptoms appear. According to guidelines
issued by the American Diabetes Associa-
tion and the American Academy of Oph-
thalmology (9), patients with type 2 dia-
betes are advised to have an initial screen-
ing examination for diabetic retinopathy
shortly after being diagnosed as diabetic.
After the primary fundus evaluation,
annual examinations are recommended
unless more frequent examinations are
indicated. Several studies point out that
there is low awareness and low compliance
to these guidelines for various reasons
(10­14). In many cases, ophthalmic sur-
veillance of high-risk patients with diabetes
is inadequate, and advanced disease is often
present at initial presentation.
Regardless of the reason for admission,
the hospitalization of a diabetic patient
offers an opportunity to screen for diabetic
retinopathy. The objective of this study was
to assess the awareness of diabetic retinopa-
thy among hospitalized patients with dia-
betes and the adequacy of the ophthalmic
surveillance given to these patients. All
patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalized in
the internal medicine wards of one hospital
during one month were candidates for
inclusion in the study, regardless of the rea-
son for hospitalization. Of these patients,
165 were suitable and agreed to be inter-
viewed and to undergo funduscopic exami-
nation. The patients were asked if they
knew about possible ocular involvement in
diabetes and if they ever underwent oph-
thalmologic evaluation. All had a dilated
fundus examination. Each patient received
an explanation regarding diabetic retinopa-
thy, was informed of the results of the pres-
ent examination, and was given a letter for
the family physician noting the results of
the funduscopic findings and the required
treatment or recommendations for annual
follow-up.
A total of 58 patients (35%) reported
being unaware of diabetes-associated ocu-
lar complications; 88 (53%) reported never
having had a dilated examination. Only 57
patients (35%) reported undergoing
dilated examination during the 12 months
before hospitalization. Diabetic retinopa-
thy was found in 73 patients (44%). Of the
37 (22%) patients who required laser treat-
ment, 13 (35%) were unaware that dia-
betes could cause ocular problems. Of the
58 patients who were unaware of diabetic
ocular complications, 26 (45%) had dia-
betic retinopathy (22% required laser treat-
ment). Regarding awareness, our results
are in accordance with previous studies
(11,14). Ophthalmic surveillance findings
resemble the results of several studies (12,
14,15), but are poorer than those reported
by others (16,17).
Our results indicate that ophthalmo-
logic examination of hospitalized diabetic
patients may be an effective means for pro-
viding greater awareness of diabetic
retinopathy and for screening, early detec-
tion, and identifying cases of diabetic
retinopathy. Routine dilated funduscopic
examination for all admitted patients by an
ophthalmologist may be a viable means for
overcoming the low compliance found in
numerous studies (10,12,14,15,18). This
should not replace routine ophthalmologic
screening managed by the patient's physi-
DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 23, NUMBER 9, SEPTEMBER 2000 1437

cian, but it should serve as a supplement
aimed at those patients who are not under
the recommended ophthalmic surveillance.

GAD65
Autoantibodies,
-Cell Function, and
Insulin Resistance in
Japanese-Brazilian
Adults
Outside of Japan, Brazil has the largest
population of individuals of Japan-
ese origin. Although it has been
shown that diabetic Japanese-Brazilian
individuals between 40 and 79 years of
age who were analyzed in the Japanese-
Brazilian Study Group of Bauru City, São
Paulo, Brazil (1), had a smaller mean BMI
than the nondiabetic Brazilian population
(2), they had a higher prevalence of dia-
betes (18%) than the the overall age-
matched Brazilian population (7.6%) (3).
In the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes,
instead of obesity affecting both insulin
secretion and insulin resistance, we know
that obesity may vary the relative impor-
tance of insulin deficiency and insulin
resistance in different ethnic groups (4).
To compare diabetes in Japanese-
Brazilians with type 2 diabetes in non-
Japanese Brazilians, we evaluated anthropo-
metric data, fasting plasma glucose mea-
surements (glucose oxidase method), total
plasma insulin levels with a radioim-
munoassay (RIA) kit (Insulin-CT; CIS Bio
International, Cedex, France), -cell func-
tion with the homeostasis model assess-
ment (HOMA) ([20  insulin (µU/ml)/
glucose (mmol/l) ­ 3.5]), and insulin resis-
tance (HOMA-IR) ([insulin (µU/ml)  glu-
cose (mmol/l)/ 22.5]) applied to fasting
insulin/glucose pairs in each individual.
The GAD65 autoantibodies were measured
in the fasting serum by an RIA procedure
using a commercial reagent kit that used
125I­human recombinant GAD65 (Kronus,
San Clemente, CA).
These variables were studied in a sam-
ple of 49 Japanese-Brazilians with dia-
betes, 50 Japanese-Brazilians without dia-
betes, 47 non-Japanese Brazilians with
type 2 diabetes, and 45 non-Japanese
Brazilians without diabetes.
The Ethics Committee of the São
Paulo Hospital of São Paulo Federal Uni-
versity approved the study. The classifica-
tion of the patients and the control sub-
jects was in accordance with World Health
Organization criteria (5).
All groups were of the same age range
(40­67 years). The diabetic Japanese-Brazil-
ian (25.8 ± 4.5 kg/m2) and the nondiabetic
Japanese-Brazilian (23.6 ± 3.1 kg/m2) popu-
lations had similar BMIs, but both popula-
tions had BMIs lower than both the non-
Japanese­Brazilian population with type 2
diabetes (28.8 ± 4.4 kg/m2) and the non-
Japanese­Brazilian population without dia-
betes (26.4 ± 4.4 kg/m2, P  0.05).
The GAD65 prevalence (upper limit of
normal 0.79 kU/ml [mean  3 SD of that
found in nondiabetic non-Japanese Brazil-
ians]) was similar among each of the
groups: 3 of 50 (6%) diabetic Japanese
Brazilians, 3 of 51 (5.9%) nondiabetic Japa-

nese Brazilians, and 3 of 47 (6.4%) of the
type 2 diabetic non-Japanese Brazilians.
-Cell function was lower in patients
with diabetes (median 85.7%, range
1.1­617.7, and median 134.3%, range
18.1­445.9, in diabetic Japanese Brazil-
ians and type 2 diabetic non-Japanese
Brazilians, respectively) than in control
subjects (median 307.9%, range 41.8
1,669.0, and median 320.5%, range
121.5­1,958.6, P  0.05, in nondiabetic
Japanese Brazilians and nondiabetic non-
Japanese Brazilians, respectively).
Measurements of HOMA-IR were
higher in type 2 diabetic non-Japanese
Brazilians (median 8.4, range 2.8­28.8)
than in nondiabetic non-Japanese Brazilians
(median 5.1, range 1.9­51.9, P  0.05),
and were similar in diabetic Japanese Brazil-
ians (median 7.6, range 0.2­25.9) and non-
diabetic Japanese Brazilians (median 5.6,
range 0.6­21.3).
In the diabetic Japanese-Brazilian pop-
ulation, the presentation of the disease
sometimes prevents one from easily per-
forming a clinical etiological characteriza-
tion. Some of these patients have an abrupt
onset of disease, whereas others have a
slower onset that seems to represent insulin
necessity but not insulin dependence.
The HOMA score explores the sponta-
neous homeostatic characteristics of a
metabolic system by inferring the degree
of -cell function and insulin sensitivity
that is compatible with a particular blood
glucose level. Although this method has
some limitations, comparing -cell func-
tion and insulin resistance by HOMA is
advantageous when individuals have simi-
lar basal fasting glucose levels (6).
Our patients, diabetic Japanese Brazil-
ians and type 2 diabetic non-Japanese
Brazilians, were age-matched (median 57
years, range 42­67, and 57 years, range
40­65, respectively), they were within the
same range of metabolic control (fasting
plasma glucose levels 8.8 ± 3.2 and 8.5 ±
3.0 mmol\l), and their times of clinical
diagnosis of diabetes were similar (median
2.0 and 1.6 years, respectively).
The degree of HOMA-IR in type 2 dia-
betic non-Japanese Brazilians was higher
than that in their matched control sub-
jects, nondiabetic non-Japanese Brazilians.
On the other hand, as a total group, it was
found that the degree of HOMA-IR was
similar in diabetic Japanese Brazilians and
nondiabetic Japanese Brazilians. This simi-
larity also persists when taking their BMI
into account. However, intragroup analy-
sis shows that the rise in BMI was associ-
ated with an increase in HOMA-IR only in
the diabetic cohorts, type 2 diabetic non-
Japanese Brazilians, and diabetic Japanese
Brazilians. These data reinforce that, in
both diabetic groups, obesity is only one
factor among others, such as hypergly-
cemia, that is responsible for the difference
in the insulin resistance level between dia-
betic and healthy nondiabetic individuals
when they become obese.
When this study was performed, as
expected in a clinical phase of diabetes, the
diabetic Japanese-Brazilian and the type 2
diabetic non-Japanese­Brazilian groups
had lower -cell function in comparison
with their matched control groups, nondi-
abetic non-Japanese Brazilians and nondia-
betic Japanese Brazilians, respectively.
The 3 Japanese-Brazilian healthy con-
trol subjects who were GAD65 autoanti-
body­positive had no diabetic first-degree
relatives and they were without autoim-
mune disease. Therefore, without conduct-
ing follow-ups, we are unable to explain
this unexpected positivity to GAD65
autoantibodies in these subjects.
The mean positivity for GAD65 auto-
antibodies in type 2 diabetic non-Japanese
Brazilians was 5.9%, which is similar to
findings of many studies of the literature
(7,8), and it varies from 2.8 to 9% in this
type of diabetes.
Interestingly, we found an inverse asso-
ciation in the entire Japanese-Brazilian
group between the tendency of reduction of
the -cell function and the titers of GAD65
autoantibodies. The group of GAD65 autoan-
tibody­positive individuals had lower levels
of -cell function than the GAD65 autoan-
tibody­negative individuals (P  0.05).
When we performed a backward
stepwise regression analysis of all of the
individuals included in the 4 study
groups, by considering the -cell function
as the dependent variable and through the
combination of the variables, we could
predict in the diabetic Japanese-Brazilian
group GAD65-autoantibody titers (r =
0.242, P = 0.0104) and the time of dia-
betes diagnosis (r = 0.287, P = 0.022).
In the type 2 diabetic non-Japanese­Brazil-
ian group, though, only the time of dia-
betes diagnosis could be predicted (r =
0.223, P = 0.015).
In conclusion, these results show that,
in comparison with non-Japanese Brazilian
adults with type 2 diabetes, the Japanese-
Brazilian individuals with diabetes showed
the same prevalence of GAD65, similar
insulin resistance, and similar -cell func-
tion. In this sample of 40- to 67-year-old
Japanese Brazilians, the individuals with
diabetes showed a lesser degree of -cell
function once they had the same degree of
insulin resistance as their matched control
subjects. We can speculate that in the
Japanese-Brazilian group, the GAD65 anti-
body levels, as well as the time of diagnosis
of diabetes, is a factor that could be related
to low -cell function.

Assessment of
Insulin Sensitivity
and Insulin Secretion
From the Oral
Glucose Tolerance
Test in Nonobese
Japanese Type 2
Diabetic Patients
Comparison with minimal-model
approach
The ability to dispose of carbohy-
drates depends on insulin sensitivity
and pancreatic -cell function. To
estimate these 2 factors simultaneously is
important in the pathogenesis of type 2
diabetes, because the estimate of -cell
function is influenced by the degree of
insulin resistance (1,2). In this context,
the minimal model approach shown by
Bergman (1) enables us to estimate these
2 factors simultaneously. This technique,
however, requires many blood samples
(30) to be collected and cannot be
applied to large population studies. Thus,
a simple method to estimate the 2 factors
simultaneously is needed. Stumvoll et al.
(3) recently disclosed that the oral glu-
cose tolerance test (OGTT) can assess
insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in
nondiabetic subjects when compared
with the results derived from the eugly-
cemic and hyperglycemic clamp studies.
Moreover, they concluded that insulin
sensitivity from euglycemic clamp proce-
dure was best correlated with the meta-
bolic clearance rate of insulin (MCR) and
the insulin sensitivity index (ISI) pre-
dicted from the OGTT-derived equations.
In addition, they confirmed that the ISI
(composite) proposed by Matsuda and
DeFronzo (4), the Ins 120, and the
homeostasis model assessment insulin
resistance (HOMA-IR) shown by Matthews
et al. (5) were also correlated to eugly-
cemic clamp­derived insulin sensitivity
in nondiabetic subjects. On the other
hand, -cell function derived from the
hyperglycemic clamp method was best
correlated with values predicted by equa-
tions from the OGTT followed by area
under the curve (AUC) Ins/AUC Gluc,
Ins30/Glu30, HOMA -cell function
proposed by Matthews et al. (5), and
Ins30/Glu30. However, to our knowl-
edge, the validity of the OGTT to evaluate
insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion
has not yet been investigated in diabetic
subjects. To accomplish this, we calcu-
lated insulin sensitivity and insulin secre-
tion from the results of the OGTT and
then compared them with those obtained
from the minimal-model approach in the
Japanese diabetic populations.
There were 25 nonobese type 2 dia-
betic patients who participated in the
study, after provision of informed con-
sent. Their age and BMI were 45.4 ± 2.3
years (mean ± SEM) and 20.2 ± 0.6
kg/m2 (range 13.5­25.3), respectively.
Their HbA1c
levels were 7.2 ± 0.3%
(range 5.1­11.3). Type 2 diabetes was
diagnosed based on the criteria of the
World Health Organization (6). The dura-
tion of the diagnosis of diabetes was 3.3 ±
0.8 years (range 0.1­17). Five type 2 dia-
betic patients were treated with sul-
fonylureas and the rest were treated with
diet alone. None of the participants in
this study consumed alcohol or per-
formed heavy exercise for at least 1 week
before the test. For at least 3 days before
the test, their body weight was stable.
All subjects had ingested at least 150 g
carbohydrate for the 3 days preceding
the study.
After an overnight fast, a butterfly
needle was inserted into the antecubital
vein and maintained by a slow drip of
physiological saline. Subjects were
allowed to rest quietly for at least 15 min
before blood sampling began. Baseline
samples for glucose and insulin assays
were obtained at 3 min. Glucose (300
mg/kg body wt) was administered intra-
venously within 2 min and insulin (20
mU/kg body wt) was infused from 20 to
25 min after intravenous glucose injec-
tion (7). The samples were obtained from
the contralateral antecubital vein at fre-
quent intervals until 180 min as previ-
ously described (7). Plasma was frozen
and stored at 20°C for subsequent
analysis. The subjects' plasma glucose
levels were measured in duplicate with an
automatic analyzer (Kyoto-Daiichi-
Kagaku, Kyoto, Japan) by the glucose
oxidase method. Immunoreactive insulin
was assayed in duplicate in using a
Phadeseph insulin radioimmunoassay kit
(Shionogi, Osaka, Japan). Insulin sensi-
tivity was estimated by the minimal-
model approach (1,7). Insulin secretion
was expressed as the area under the
insulin curve between 0 and 10 min after
an intravenous glucose injection. The
integrated area of plasma insulin above
basal level was calculated using the trape-
zoidal method (8). The statistical analysis
was performed with the StatView 5 sys-
tem (StatView, Berkeley, CA). Pearson lin-
ear regression analysis and analysis of
variance determined correlation. P 
0.05 was considered significant.
ISI obtained from the minimal-model
approach was best correlated with the ISI
(composite) (r = 0.677, P  0.001), fol-
lowed by root HOMA-IR (r = 0.542, P 
0.001), log HOMA-IR (r = 0.502, P =
0.011), Ins 120 (r = 0.492, P = 0.013),
and HOMA-IR (r = 0.459, P = 0.021) in
our type 2 diabetic patients. On the other
hand, insulin secretion during intravenous
glucose tolerance test was best correlated
to IRI 30/Glu 30 (r = 0.663, P 
0.001), followed by IRI 30/Glu 30 (r =
0.660, P  0.001), HOMA -cell function
(r = 0.646, P  0.001), and IRI 30 (r =
0.619, P  0.001) in our type 2 diabetic
patients. From these results, it may be con-
cluded that our nonobese Japanese type 2
diabetic patients can estimate insulin sensi-
tivity and insulin secretion from the results
during the OGTT. Moreover, it may be
inferred that HOMA-IR and HOMA -cell
function are also a reliable ways to estimate
insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in
nonobese Japanese type 2 diabetic patients
who do not perform the OGTT.

Assessment of
Insulin Secretion
From the Oral
Glucose Tolerance
Test in White
Patients With
Type 2 Diabetes
We have recently proposed a method
to assess insulin sensitivity and
insulin secretion using the oral glu-
cose tolerance test (OGTT) in nondiabetic
subjects (including those subjects with
impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) (1). The
euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic and the
hyperglycemic clamp technique validated
the models, respectively. In the letter by
Taniguchi et al. (2), the idea was extended to
include Japanese subjects with type 2 dia-
betes. Their models were validated by the
minimal model approach (3). They found
that insulin sensitivity was best predicted
by insulin sensitivity index composite
(4) and insulin secretion by (Ins30
­Ins0
)/
(Gluc30
­Gluc0
). We applied the analogous
methodology to determine if insulin secre-
tion as measured by the hyperglycemic
clamp can be estimated from the OGTT in
white patients with type 2 diabetes.
After obtaining informed written con-
sent from the subjects, we studied 28 white
patients with type 2 diabetes (World Health
Organization criteria [5]) using the OGTT
and hyperglycemic clamp (10 mmol/l, 180
min) as previously described (1). Their age
(mean ± SEM) was 54 ± 2 years, BMI 27.7 ±
0.9 kg/m2, fasting glucose 7.0 ± 0.2 mmol/l,
2-h glucose 14.0 ± 0.5 mmol/l, and fasting
insulin 88 ± 9 pmol/l. Plasma insulin was
determined by radioimmunoassay (Pharma-
cia, Piscataway, NJ) or microparticle enzyme
immunoassay (Abbott Laboratories, Tokyo),
and plasma glucose was determined using a
glucose analyzer (YSI, Yellow Springs, OH,
or HemoCue, Aengelholm, Sweden). Indi-
vidual phases of insulin secretion were deter-
mined as previously described (1). In brief,
the first-phase insulin secretion was consid-
ered to be the sum of plasma insulin concen-
trations at 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 min of the
hyperglycemic clamp experiment minus the
mean basal plasma insulin concentration,
and the second-phase insulin secretion was
taken as the average plasma insulin concen-
tration during the last hour of the hypergly-
cemic clamp minus the mean basal plasma
insulin concentration.
Simple and stepwise multiple linear
regression was performed with first- and
second-phase insulin release as the depen-
dent variables and demographic parame-
ters and glucose and insulin concentra-
tions during the OGTT. The homeostasis
model assessment (HOMA) secretion
index was calculated as Ins0
 3.33/(Gluc0
 3.5) (6). The statistical software pack-
age Sigmastat (SPSS, Chicago) was used.
With simple linear regression, clamp
determinations of first and second phases of
insulin release were best correlated with
AUCIns
/AUCGluc
(r = 0.70 and 0.74, respec-
tively; P  0.001), followed by HOMA
(both r = 0.69; P  0.001) and (Ins30
­
Ins0
)/Gluc30
(r = 0.64 and 0.69, respectively;
P  0.001). Among single insulin concen-
trations, Ins120
was best correlated with first-
phase (r = 0.62; P  0.001) and second-
phase insulin release (r = 0.67; P 
0.001). Using stepwise multiple linear
regression, 2 parameters entered the equa-
tions: first phase predicted = 59 
24.1  AUCIns
/AUCGluc
 0.98  Ins90
(multi-
ple r = 0.81; P  0.001); second phase pre-
dicted = 0.41  8.1  AUCIns
/AUCGluc

0.27  Ins90
(multiple r = 0.78; P  0.001).
We conclude from these results that in
this white diabetic population, insulin
secretion as determined by a hyperglycemic
clamp can be estimated from the OGTT.
The equations derived from multiple linear
regression analysis yielded the highest cor-
relation coefficient but are different from
those obtained in subjects with normal glu-
cose tolerance or with IGT. Together with
our results from the nondiabetic popula-
tion, the AUCIns
/AUCGluc
appears to be the
single best parameter to assess -cell func-
tion during an OGTT in Caucasians. Under
circumstances in which an OGTT is
impractical, HOMA also provides an accu-
rate estimate of -cell function.

Advanced Glycation
End Products and
Coronary Heart
Disease in Type 2
Diabetes
We read with interest the recently
published article by Kilhovd et al.
(1). The authors investigated to
determine if serum levels of advanced gly-
cation end products (AGEs) and the gly-
coxidation product N-(carboxymethyl)-
lysine (CML) are increased in subjects with
type 2 diabetes when compared with non-
diabetic control subjects, and whether lev-
els of AGEs and CML differed in their
cohort of 53 subjects with type 2 diabetes
when coronary heart disease (CHD) was
present or absent. Levels of AGEs and CML
were significantly increased in patients with
type 2 diabetes compared with control sub-
jects. Moreover, AGEs were significantly
higher in subjects with type 2 diabetes with
associated CHD than in subjects with type 2
diabetes without CHD. The authors suggest
that AGEs may be involved in the develop-
ment of CHD in this population. Although
this is plausible, we feel that the methods
used to screen for the presence of CHD in
this study are not sufficiently sensitive to
discriminate between the presence or
absence of CHD in this population.
This last conclusion is based on the
capacity to evaluate accurately the presence
of CHD in subjects with type 2 diabetes (2).
At baseline, the investigators diagnosed
CHD on the basis of the following: 1) clini-
cal examination and medical history of
angina pectoris or myocardial infarction, 2)
resting electrocardiogram (ECG) measure-
ments, and 3) exercise ECG measurements.
During follow-up (median 5 years), CHD
was diagnosed solely according to resting
ECG measurements and new symptoms
suggestive of angina pectoris. No exercise
ECG was performed. The total number of
patients with CHD corresponded to the
addition of subjects at baseline and at fol-
low-up. Unfortunately, the authors did not
provide the number of new cases of CHD.
It is well known that diabetes is associ-
ated with silent ischemia (2,3), and sub-
jects with type 2 diabetes can often have a
normal resting ECG and still have suffered
a previous myocardial infarction. Further-
more, exercise testing and/or cardiac-imag-
ing techniques should be used to detect
silent ischemia without symptoms or exer-
cise ECG ST segment changes (3­6). In the
same issue of Diabetes Care, Janand-
Delenne et al. (7) have effectively demon-
strated that a significant number (21%) of
patients with type 2 diabetes, with the
absence of clinical or ECG symptoms sug-
gestive of CHD, had significant (50%)
angiographic lesions. Moreover, 50% of
the subjects with type 2 diabetes were con-
sidered ineligible for exercise testing, thus
putting even more emphasis on the imag-
ing technique to properly unmask the
presence of CHD in this population (3,7).
In summary, the absence of exercise
testing and/or cardiac imaging to detect
CHD at follow-up make problematic the
suggestion that AGEs were higher in the
patients with diabetes with CHD. There-
fore, the importance of AGEs in the patho-
physiology of CHD in subjects with type 2
diabetes needs to be revisited.

(AGEs) have been linked to the develop-
ment of atherosclerosis in the arterial wall.
So far, none of the diagnostic tools available
for in vivo use, perhaps with the exception
of intracoronary ultrasound, can describe
this process directly. Hence, all diagnostic
tests are surrogate measurements and in
clinical practice, we will often use combina-
tions of tests. The diagnostic procedures for
coronary heart disease (CHD) in the pres-
ent study probably underestimate the num-
ber of patients with coronary atherosclero-
sis. However, this will apply to the whole
population, and, in our view, should not
invalidate our findings.
We agree that the data regarding the
importance of AGEs in the development of
CHD in patients with diabetes are scarce
so far. Further and larger studies in this
field are in progress.

Is Testing Children
for Type 2 Diabetes
a Lost Battle?
The American Diabetes Association
recently issued a consensus statement
on type 2 diabetes in children (1).
Although the consensus panel acknowl-
edges that there are insufficient data to
make evidence-based recommendations,
it also recommends testing for type 2 dia-
betes in children 10 years of age who are
overweight and have at least 2 other risk
factors. Risk factors include the following:
1) having a family history of type 2 dia-
betes in first- or second-degree relatives,
2) belonging to certain race or ethnic
groups, and 3) having signs or conditions
associated with insulin resistance, e.g.,
acanthosis nigricans, hypertension, dys-
lipidemia, or polycystic ovary syndrome.
Fasting plasma glucose is the preferred test.
We assessed the implications of the
panel's recommendation and used data
from the third National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (2) to estimate
the number of U.S. adolescents who
would qualify for testing as recom-
mended. Fasting serum glucose was mea-
sured in 1,081 adolescents 12­19 years of
age without known diabetes.
In the period 1988­1994, 10% (95%
CI 8­13) of U.S. adolescents 12­19 years of
age were overweight and had at least 2 of
the other risk factors (3­5) (Table 1). Thus,
2.5 million adolescents would potentially
qualify for type 2 diabetes testing.
Among those who met the criteria for
testing, 73% (67­79) were from minority
populations, 48% (38­58) had a family
history of type 2 diabetes, 26% (9­43) had
hypertension, 73% (67­80) had dyslipi-
demia, and 5% (0­27) had impaired fast-
ing glucose (IFG) or undiagnosed dia-
betes, all in addition to being overweight.
Because of the small number of cases, we
could not estimate the number of adoles-
cents with diabetes, but we still can use
the survey sample to illustrate these fig-
ures. There were 199 of 1,081 adolescents
who met the criteria for testing. Within
that group of 199, 1 adolescent had undi-
agnosed diabetes (fasting glucose 7
mmol/l) and 4 others had IFG (6
mmol/l). None of the 882 adolescents who
did not meet the criteria for testing were
diagnosed with diabetes, but 16 had IFG.
The recommendations for testing chil-
dren for type 2 diabetes lead to testing a
very large number of children, while offer-
ing a rather small yield, due to the low
prevalence of diabetes. To make matters
potentially worse, we underestimated the
number to test. Acanthosis nigricans, poly-
cystic ovary syndrome, and family history
in second-degree relatives for children 17
years of age were not assessed in the survey,
children 10­11 years of age did not have
glucose measured, and we did not consider
high triglyceride and low HDL cholesterol
levels. In addition, although it is likely that
the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in chil-
dren has increased since 1988­1994, the
prevalence of most of these risk factors
probably followed a similar trend.
It is well demonstrated that type 2 dia-
betes is a devastating disease with lifelong
complications and control efforts are badly
needed, especially for children (6). Rather
than challenging the need for testing chil-
dren whose clinical features strongly sug-
gest type 2 diabetes, the figures we present
here highlight at least the need for refining
the criteria for case finding in general.
Efforts at early detection may, however,
not be cost-effective, and may divert
resources away from more important and
cost-effective interventions.

Is Testing Children
for Type 2 Diabetes
a Lost Battle?
Response to Fagot-Campagna et al.
Fagot-Campagna et al. (1) opine that the
recently published American Diabetes
Association (ADA) consensus panel
recommendations on testing children at
risk for type 2 diabetes will lead to massive
overtesting, and they indicate that criteria
for better case-finding need to be refined.
The consensus report did, in fact, note that
school or community-based studies should
be carried out to demonstrate the value of
individual tests and to establish the strength
and risk level of various factors that might
be influential in the development of type 2
diabetes. It was also emphasized that the
studies should be carried out in popula-
tions with sufficient numbers of children
who are at high risk. This would also pro-
vide an indication of the frequency of undi-
agnosed type 2 diabetes in children, which
is presently unknown outside certain
Native American groups.
The data provided by Fagot-Cam-
pagna et al. (1) neither detract from the
recommendations of the consensus panel
nor suggest alternatives. The data are diffi-
cult to accept as representative or sufficient
to derive the estimates that are provided.
Even though the consensus panel rec-
ommendations on case-finding recognize
the need for a population-based study of
their application, their immediate value
and importance is to emphasize to the
clinician the importance of testing chil-
dren who have the noted risk factors. In
fact, Fagot-Campagna et al. (1) state that
they do not challenge the need for testing
children whose clinical features strongly
suggest type 2 diabetes. This is consistent
with the recommendations regarding the
identification of cardiovascular risk factors
in obese children, as suggested by their
colleagues at the Division of Nutrition and
Physical Activity at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (2). The most
important reason for placing these recom-
mendations before the public is to com-
municate an awareness of the risk factors
and the need to test those at risk.
The ADA consensus panel chose to
not make its recommendations restrictive
by suggesting that clinical judgment
should be used to test patients who may
not meet these criteria. The criteria were:
overweight (BMI 85th percentile for age
and sex, weight for height 85th per-
centile, or weight 120% of ideal for
height) plus two other risk factors--family
history of type 2 diabetes in first- or sec-
ond-degree relative; American Indian,
African-American, Hispanic, or Asian/Pacific
Islander ethnicity; or signs of insulin resis-
tance or conditions associate with insulin
resistance such as acanthosis nigricans,
hypertension, dyslipidemia, or PCOS. It
was recommended that testing begin at 10
years or at the onset of puberty if earlier,
with a frequency of every 2 years, and the
preferred test was the fasting plasma glu-
cose measurement. This is hardly a pre-
scription for rampant overtesting.
The importance of the clinical judg-
ment disclaimer is emphasized by the last
10 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes
in our clinic. None had symptoms of dia-
betes. Five were under 10 years of age, 6
were white, and 4 had only one other risk
factor besides obesity (a family history of
type 2 diabetes) that resulted in their being
tested. The rest were diagnosed because of
the incidental finding of glucosuria in 2
patients, which was found while being
studied for vaginitis or dysuria (J.H. Silver-
stein, personal communication). Such early
detection by alerting primary practitioners
holds the promise of forestalling complica-
tions, which appear to be particularly accel-
erated in this patient group, and preventing
hospitalization or death from hyperosmolar
nonketotic coma.
Testing children for type 2 diabetes is
most assuredly not a losing battle. Recog-
nizing that children and adolescents with
type 2 diabetes are frequently asympto-
matic, case-finding in the at-risk population
should be considered good practice.

Delineating the
Relationship
Between Stress,
Depressive
Symptoms, and
Glucose Intolerance
In recent issues of Diabetes Care, several
studies have reported a relationship
between stressful life events and
glycemic control (1) and between depres-
sive symptoms and glycemic control
among clinical (2) and population-based
studies (3­5) of diabetes. In their study,
Gary et al. (4) reported that behavioral fac-
tors (e.g., diet, exercise, and self-monitor-
ing behavior) did not explain the relation-
ship between the Center for Epidemiologic
Studies-Depression scale (CES-D)-assessed
depressive symptoms and metabolic con-
trol. They offered a possible explanation for
the observed relationship: that it might be
1444 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 23, NUMBER 9, SEPTEMBER 2000
Letters
manifested via a causal pathway that is
independent of behavioral factors (4).
Other investigators have also suggested
that behavioral factors cannot fully explain
the relationship between stress, depres-
sion, and metabolic control (6­9).
Most recently, Mooy et al. (10)
reported a significant association between
stressful life events and prevalence of
undetected type 2 diabetes in a popula-
tion-based study. We take particular inter-
est in this study because of our own obser-
vations among a population-based sample
of Native Hawaiians (11). We reported that
CES-D­assessed depressive symptoms
were associated with glycemic control,
even after patients with a prior diagnosis of
diabetes were excluded from analysis (11).
The exclusion of patients with prior diag-
noses of diabetes in both of these studies
suggests that neither behavioral factors,
such as treatment compliance, nor psycho-
logical reaction to a chronic condition can
fully explain these associations. Further-
more, longitudinal studies have demon-
strated that depressive symptoms and
depression may increase the risk of devel-
oping type 2 diabetes (6­8).
Our observations and those of Mooy
et al. agree with the theory by Bjorntorp et
al. (9) that stressful life events or chronic
psychological stress are associated with
glucose intolerance. Several biological
mechanisms have been posited to explain
the association. For example, depressive
disorders are associated with disruption
of the sympathoadrenal system and dis-
regulation of the hypothalamopituitary
adrenal axis, each of which may impair
carbohydrate uptake, thereby leading to
increased blood glucose and glucose
intolerance. Alternatively, glucose intoler-
ance and/or insulin resistance may cause
changes in the neuroendocrine system
that subsequently affect perceived stress
or mood-state. Elevated glucose levels
may cause a heightened state of arousal,
which may be reported as stress or
depressive symptoms (e.g., fatigue or lack
of concentration). Finally, depressive
symptoms and glucose intolerance may
share a common pathogenesis. Bjorntorp
et al. reported that a common polymor-
phism of the glucocorticoid receptor gene
was associated with abdominal obesity,
insulin resistance, and hypertension. A
study examining whether or not individu-
als with these abnormalities are sensitive
to environmental stressors is currently
underway (12).
In conclusion, the causal relationship
of stress and depressive symptoms with
glucose intolerance has not been ade-
quately delineated. Although several
recent longitudinal studies have assessed
baseline depressive symptoms as predic-
tors of diabetes, none of these studies
examined the converse relationship. In
other words, no longitudinal study has
examined the effect of baseline glucose
and insulin on either changes in mood or
response to stress. Additional population-
based studies, in which glucose tolerance
and insulin resistance is assessed for a
cohort of individuals, are necessary to bet-
ter elucidate the causal relationships of the
biological factors discussed here.

Association Between
Socioeconomic
Factors and the
Metabolic Syndrome
in Women With
Prior Gestational
Diabetes Mellitus
In the December issue of Diabetes Care,
Wamala et al. (1) reported that lower
levels of education are associated with
an increased risk for metabolic syndrome
in middle-aged women. This result con-
firms recent reports suggesting the link
between socioeconomic factors and car-
diovascular disease and diabetes or its late
complications (2­4). Because prior gesta-
tional diabetes mellitus (GDM) seems to
be associated with the components of the
metabolic syndrome, or even is a predic-
tor of it (5,6), it may be of importance to
gain some information about a similar
relationship between socioeconomic fac-
tors and metabolic syndrome in women
with prior GDM.
To study the previously mentioned
connection, we analyzed follow-up data of
108 women with GDM 8 years after deliv-
ery (mean [± SD] age, 37.4 ± 6.0 years;
71% of the patients were treated with
insulin during pregnancy), randomly
selected from a cohort of women cared for
by our interdisciplinary team between
DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 23, NUMBER 9, SEPTEMBER 2000 1445
Letters
1985 and 1990. During this period,
women with GDM who were considered
to be in need of special care were referred
to our center. For the evaluation of meta-
bolic syndrome, the same components
and methods (dyslipidemia, central obe-
sity, hypertension, glucose intolerance)
were used as in the study of Wamala et al.
(1), although the exact definitions differed.
Hypertension, however, was defined as
blood pressure 160/90 mmHg or if the
subjects were on blood pressure­lowering
medication and glucose intolerance as
antidiabetic therapy or abnormal result of a
75-g OGTT according to the World Health
Organization criteria (7). Socioeconomic
status (SES) was measured by education
level (primary school, high school, or col-
lege/university), current employment, and
marital status, or according to permanent
residence (urban or rural).
At least 2 components of the meta-
bolic syndrome were detected in 49
(45%) women at follow-up (dyslipidemia
80%, obesity 69%, glucose intolerance
88%, and hypertension 57%). Patients
with lower education (P  0.01) or who
were unemployed (P  0.01) had a
higher risk for metabolic syndrome (uni-
variate comparisons); however, marital
status and residence showed no signifi-
cant connection to it. The age-adjusted
odds ratio for metabolic syndrome was
7.05 (95% CI, 1.68­29.46) between the
lowest and highest educational levels,
whereas it was 4.27 (1.39­13.14) when
comparing unemployment with employ-
ment. In a multivariate analysis (logistic
regression including age, education,
employment, and residence), only lower
education level (P  0.05) and unem-
ployment (P  0.05) entered the model
as independent covariates.
In a homogenous cohort of relatively
young women with prior GDM, an almost
4-times-higher frequency of metabolic
syndrome was found in comparison to
the results of Wamala et al. (1). Because
the selection criteria for this study were
related to the patients' metabolic state,
there is no reason to suppose that selec-
tion bias occurred during analysis. Our
results not only confirm the results of
Wamala et al. found in healthy women,
but also suggest that a similar relationship
exists in women with prior GDM (i.e.,
low education and unemployment might
increase the existing risk of women with
GDM for metabolic syndrome) (1,5,6).
Screening for GDM, follow-up, and care
for women later in life is therefore of
utmost importance, especially in those
with lower SES to prevent clustering of
cardiovascular risk factors.

Preventing
Amputations Among
Patients With
Diabetes on Dialysis
We read with interest Drs. McGrath
and Curran's (1) observations
from New Zealand about the high
amputation rates in Maori people with
diabetes after they began dialysis. We had
similar findings in our work to reduce dia-
betic foot complications in Native Ameri-
can communities in northern Minnesota.
As we instituted measures to identify and
protect diabetic community members
with high-risk feet, we saw amputation
rates decrease from 29 to 21 per 1,000
diabetic person-years in the periods from
1986­1989 to 1990­1993. We then intro-
duced treatment guidelines to stage, treat,
and refer foot ulcers according to well-
defined clinical pathways called Staged
Diabetes Management, and amputation
rates decreased to 15/1,000, as published
previously (2). When we reviewed our
registry of amputations, we realized that
the residual amputations largely occurred
among those on dialysis.
We postulated that dialysis patients
often lost contact with care outside the dial-
ysis setting. Preventive foot care, early
detection of foot problems, and follow-up
care for foot ulcers after hospitalization off-
reservation were not always a part of rou-
tine dialysis care. Accordingly, we instituted
an outreach wound care clinic to follow
those who had been referred off-reservation
for management of severe foot ulcers, and
we extended these services to diabetic
patients who were receiving dialysis in the
local reservation facility. In the 3 years
(1997­1999) after instituting this outreach
program, amputation rates decreased to
7/1,000 (P  0.001 vs. baseline).
These observations also led us to ask if
our experience was unique. Medicare hos-
pitalizations in which a lower-extremity
amputation was performed were used to
assess non-traumatic lower-extremity
amputation in all Medicare end stage renal
disease patients (3). The overall amputa-
tion rate for dialysis patients in the U.S.
was 4.9/100 in 1994 and, for those ESRD
beneficiaries with diabetes, the annualized
1446 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 23, NUMBER 9, SEPTEMBER 2000
Letters
amputation rate was 13.8/100. Native
Americans with diabetes had the highest
rates. Among nondiabetic dialysis patients,
African-Americans experienced the highest
amputation rates. Thus, it appears that all
dialysis patients, particularly those with
diabetes, are at very high risk for lower-
extremity amputation.
In summary, we found that McGrath
and Curran's (1) observations are consis-
tent with ours. Dialysis patients with dia-
betes and those on dialysis for other rea-
sons have both neuropathy and vascular
disease that predispose them to foot ulcers,
poor wound healing, and the cascade of
events that lead to amputation. Foot care is
often not a priority in settings that are busy
providing dialysis. When we recognized
the problem and extended foot care specif-
ically to the dialysis setting, we observed a
decrease in amputation rates in diabetic
community members. Diabetic individuals
worldwide receiving renal replacement
therapy are at high risk for amputation and
the rates can be reduced with interventions
designed to reach them.

Response to
Rith-Najarian and
Gohdes
Thank you to Drs. Rith-Najarian and
Gohdes (1) for their interest in our
letter (2) and for providing data of
high amputation rates in diabetic Native
Americans on dialysis similar to those we
found in New Zealand Maori.
We have also instituted an intensive
podiatric and orthotic service for our dia-
betic dialysis patients in the year since our
study was completed. The lower-extremity
amputation (LEA) rate in this group of
patients has fallen from 14 patients for the
previous 2 years to 2 per year.
Only 1 of the 2 dialysis patients who
required an LEA had seen our podiatrist
before their amputation.
