Objective: Cross sectional studies in the United States often find a significant positive association
between levels of household firearm ownership and suicide rates. This study investigates whether the
association can be explained by differences in levels of mental health.
Methods: The relationship between household handgun ownership and overall suicide rates across
United States regions after accounting for two mental health variables--lifetime prevalence of major
depression and serious suicidal thoughts--were examined. Analyses also add another control variable
(urbanization, education, unemployment, or alcohol consumption). Data on mental health variables
come from the National Comorbidity Study, conducted in the early 1990s. Data on household hand-
gun ownership come from the General Social Surveys.
Results: Across the nine regions for the early 1990s (n = 9), household handgun ownership rates are
positively correlated with the suicide rate (r = 0.59) and are not correlated with either the lifetime
prevalence of major depression or suicidal thoughts. After controlling for major depression and suicidal
thoughts (and any of the four additional control variables), handgun ownership rates remain
significantly associated with the overall suicide rate.
Conclusions: In United States regions with higher levels of household handgun ownership, there are
higher suicide rates. This relationship cannot be explained by differences in the prevalence of two
mental health indicators--lifetime rates of either major depression or suicidal thoughts.
Cross sectional studies in the United States, across
regions,1 2 states,3­5 and urban counties or cities,6 7 often
find a significant association between rates of house-
hold firearm ownership and suicide rates.8 Control variables
have included urbanicity, education, unemployment and alco-
hol problems, but no ecological study we know of has control-
led for possible mental health confounders.
In this article we use data from the National Comorbidity
Survey (NCS) to investigate the regional relationship of hand-
gun ownership levels and two psychological measures--
lifetime prevalence of major depression and serious suicidal
thoughts--with rates of suicide.
Our primary aim is to begin to investigate whether the
association between firearm prevalence and suicide can be
explained by differences in levels of mental health.
METHODS
This study focuses on three related dependent variables: the
total suicide rate, the firearm suicide rate, and the non-firearm
suicide rate across the nine census regions. We begin with
three explanatory variables, which are included in all
analyses: rates of household handgun ownership, lifetime
prevalence of major depression, and lifetime prevalence of
serious suicidal thoughts. We also add a fourth explanatory
variable--which is (1) the percent of the population living in
metropolitan areas, or (2) the percent with at least some col-
lege, or (3) the percent unemployed, or (4) the per capita alco-
hol consumption. These four control variables are added, one
at a time, to regressions that include (as independent
variables) the prevalence of household handgun ownership,
lifetime suicidal thoughts, and lifetime major depression (that
is, these regressions have four rather than three independent
variables).
For suicides, we use average regional rates for a 10 year
period (1988­97). Data for the number of suicides, firearm
suicides, and non-firearm suicides as well as yearly population
figures come from the National Center for Health Statistics
Mortality Files.9 Deaths from firearm of undetermined inten-
tion constitute less than 3% of all firearm deaths and are
excluded from the analysis. Region specific population and
mortality data are derived by aggregating the corresponding
state based data. The suicide rate within each region is very
stable over the 10 year study period; the largest absolute (and
percentage) variation in the rate of suicide within a region
occurred in region 3, where the suicide rate averaged over the
10 year period was 10.9 per 100 000 (range 9.9­11.6 per
100 000). This within-region variation is far smaller than the
twofold variation across regions. Using the rate for any year, or
the average over the 10 years, yields similar results.
Data for the percentage of households with handguns in
each region come from published survey based estimates from
the General Social Surveys (GSS). The GSS, conducted by the
National Opinion Research Center most years from 1972 to
1993, and biennially since 1994, is the gold standard for
national surveys of gun ownership. In its current form, the
GSS is conducted in person with a national area probability
sample of 3000 non-institutionalized adults. The sample is
chosen to be representative of each of the nine census regions.
We use regional handgun ownership data averaged over the
1988­97 period.10
Because the stock of guns in the United States is so high
(over 200 million guns in civilian hands) and because guns are
highly durable goods, year-to-year variations in survey
estimates of firearm ownership rates are as likely to reflect
measurement error rather than actual fluctuations in firearm

ownership levels. Handgun ownership data are, therefore,
averaged over the 10 year study period to obtain more reliable
estimates of regional handgun ownership rates.
Data on mental health variables come from the NCS, a
nationally representative household survey of people aged
15­54 years old. The NCS was conducted between September
1990 and February 1992 to determine the prevalence,
distribution, correlates, and consequences of psychiatric
disorders in the United States. The final sample consisted of
8098 participants for a response rate of over 82%. The survey
provides representative samples of the nine census regions.
Verbal informed consent was obtained from all respondents
and from the parents of minors before the interviews began.
Detailed descriptions of the methods employed by the NCS
have been published elsewhere.11
Mental health variables come from a survey of 15­54 year
olds, whereas the suicide data pertain to all ages. Since rates of
depression and suicide may be higher in more elderly groups,
analyses might be biased if regional age distributions materi-
ally differ. However, across the nine regions, the percent of the
population that is 15­54 years old varies little: from 70% to
73% with a mean of 72%. Moreover, the correlation coefficient
across the nine regions between the suicide rate for all
individuals and for individuals 15­54 years old is 0.99. Not
surprisingly, results are virtually identical whether the
dependent variable is the regional suicide rate for all individu-
als or the regional suicide rates for individuals aged 15­54 year
olds.
The NCS provides information concerning the prevalence of
a multitude of psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders
(depression, dysthymia, mania), anxiety disorders (agorapho-
bia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic, social phobia, simple
phobia, post-traumatic stress disorders), and substance use
disorders (alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, drug abuse,
drug dependence).
All respondents who screened positive for a lifetime preva-
lence of any disorder and a random subsample of other
respondents were administered a part II interview (5877
respondents). The data for these respondents were weighted
to correct for differential probabilities of selection into part II
as well as for differential probabilities of within-household
selection and non-response. Questions on three aspects of sui-
cidality were included in the part II interview (suicidal
thoughts, plans, attempts).
Since the number of observations in our study is very small
(n = 9 regions), we decided to investigate only a small number
of disorders. The criteria for selection were a strong expected
relationship between the disorder and suicide based on the
psychological literature, and a large enough prevalence of the
disorder in the population so the attributable risk would be
sufficient to discover an effect and there would be an adequate
cell size to ensure precision of the regional estimates. For the
second criteria, we decided that the weighted national preva-
lence of the disorder had to be great enough to ensure that, if
the least populous region had an average prevalence, there
would be a minimum of 40 respondents from that region
reporting the disorder. Two disorders met our criteria: lifetime
prevalence of major depression and of serious suicidal
thoughts.
The question on suicide thoughts asked: "Have you ever
seriously thought about committing suicide?" The prevalence,
distribution, and risk factors for lifetime prevalence of ever
having serious suicidal thoughts is described in detail
elsewhere.12
Major depression is the prevalence of people having a
lifetime major depressive episode, based on responses to a
modified version of the Composite International Diagnostic
Interview. The approach to case ascertainment in the NCS,
and particularly the comparison with the use of the Diagnos-
tic Interview Schedule in the Epidemiologic Catchment Area
study is described in detail elsewhere.13
Data for the percent of the population living in metropolitan
areas, the percent with at least some college, and the percent
unemployed are 10 year averages and come from the Statisti-
cal Abstract of the United States. Data for alcohol consump-
tion pertains to gallons of beer, wine, or spirits divided by the
population over age 14 and come from the National Institute
on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
Bivariate associations are presented as simple correlation
coefficients. Multivariate models use ordinary least squares,
using two tailed t tests for statistical significance.
RESULTS
Across the nine regions, the suicide rate, averaged from 1988­
97, varies from 9.0 per 100 000 in the Mid-Atlantic region to
18.0 in the Mountain region. Table 1 provides the regional
rates of suicide, firearm suicide and non-firearm suicide, the
lifetime prevalence of major depression and suicidal thoughts,
and the average rates of household handgun ownership over
the 10 year period. Seventeen percent (17%) of respondents on
the NCS study reported ever having a major depression; resi-
dents of the Pacific region had the highest prevalence. Over
13% of respondents reported ever having serious suicidal
thoughts; the Mountain region had the highest prevalence.
Rates of household handgun ownership range from 12% in the
Mid-Atlantic region to 38% in the East South Central region.
Across the nine regions, household handgun ownership
rates are highly positively correlated with the suicide rate (r =
0.59), and the firearm suicide rate (r = 0.83), and negatively
correlated with the non-firearm suicide rate (r = -0.57) (table
2). Household handgun ownership rates are not correlated
with either the prevalence of major depression (r = -0.10) or
suicidal thoughts (r = -0.01).
The prevalence of major depression and prevalence of
suicidal thoughts are positively correlated, but the prevalence
of major depression is not correlated with the suicide rate
(r = 0.00), while the prevalence of suicidal thoughts is corre-
lated with the suicide rate (r = 0.68) (table 2). Figure 1
provides a graphical representation of regional suicide rates
with household handgun ownership, prevalence of major
depression, and suicidal thoughts across the nine regions.

In multivariate regression (n = 9), with household
handgun ownership, major depression and suicidal thoughts
as the three independent variables, handgun ownership levels
are positively associated with the firearm suicide rate
(p<0.01), negatively associated with the non-firearm suicide
rate (p <0.01), and positively associated with the overall sui-
cide rate (p <0.05) (not shown). Suicidal thoughts are
positively associated with all three suicide rates (p <0.01),
while major depression is not associated with any of the three
suicide rates.
The Mountain region has the lowest population, and the
highest rate of suicide. As a sensitivity analysis we eliminated
that region from the regression (n = 8). In multivariate
analysis, the association of household handgun ownership
levels with firearm, non-firearm and total suicide rates is
unaffected, major depression remains non-significantly corre-
lated with the suicide rates, but suicidal thoughts are no
longer significantly correlated with any of the suicide rates
(not shown). The simple correlation between suicidal
thoughts and overall suicide falls dramatically (r = -0.11),
while the correlation between major depression and suicidal
thoughts rises to r = 0.93 (not shown).
When any one of the additional variables (the percent of the
population living in metropolitan areas, the percent with at
least some college, the percent unemployed, or the per capita
alcohol consumption) are added as a fourth explanatory vari-
able, the relationship between the regional prevalence of
household handgun ownership and the regional suicide rate
remains similar, statistically and in magnitude, as does the
relationship between lifetime suicidal thoughts and the
regional suicide rate (not shown).
DISCUSSION
Across United States regions, where there are more handguns
there are higher rates of firearm suicide, lower rates of
non-firearm suicide, but higher levels of overall suicide. This
article shows that regional levels of handgun ownership are
not correlated with regional lifetime rates of major depression
or suicidal thoughts. The association between rates of
handgun ownership and suicide remains strong at the
regional level even after accounting for the lifetime prevalence
of major depression and suicidal thoughts.
The association between household handgun ownership
rates and the total suicide rate is robust. The handgun-suicide
connection holds when we use the 1992 rates of suicide rather
than the 1988­97 average (not shown) and when rates of gun
ownership rather than just handgun ownership are used as an
independent variable (though the association between gun
ownership levels and suicide is not quite so strong) (not
shown). In addition, our results hold when any one of four
additional control variables are added to the analyses (urbani-
zation, education, unemployment, or alcohol consumption).
This study has various limitations. First, as in any ecological
study, a concern is that the association found at the aggregate
level does not exist at the individual level. For example, from
our data, even if there is a regional level association between
alcohol and suicide, we do not know if the individuals who are
alcohol consumers are the ones more likely to commit suicide.
However, from other studies we know that guns are the prime
method of suicide in the United States, most people who use
guns to commit suicide use family guns, and a gun in the
home is a risk factor for firearm suicide.8 We thus have some-
what less reason to be concerned about the "ecological
fallacy" with respect to the gun prevalence-suicide connec-
tion.
Second, there is uncertainty associated with our
measures--particularly our explanatory variables that come
from self report surveys--that may bias the estimated
relationships. Third, regional groupings undoubtedly mask
considerable variation in the prevalence of both handgun
ownership levels and mental health problems. Because we
have representative mental health data only at the regional
level, we have only nine observations. Fourth, we use only two
measures of mental health--lifetime prevalence of major
depression and of serious suicidal thoughts. Other mental
health and socioeconomic factors undoubtedly influence the
suicide rate.
We did not find any association between lifetime prevalence
of major depression and suicide. Using data on current (30
day) prevalence of major depression might provide a better
measure of susceptibility to suicide than lifetime prevalence.
The NCS found a prevalence of current depression of less than
5%, putting into question the precision of estimates for the
least populous of the nine census regions, if we use that
measure. Dividing the country in four regions, the prevalence
of current depression was highest in the South (where gun
prevalence and suicide rates are highest) but second highest in
the Northeast (where gun prevalence and suicide rates are
lowest).13

Rates of suicide, firearm suicide, and non-firearm suicide come from the National Center for Health Statistics.
Psychiatric disorder prevalence estimates by census region, 1991­92, come from the National Co-morbidity
Study. Lifetime major depression (n=8098) and suicidal thoughts (that is, ever seriously considered suicide)
(n=5877) were reported by 17% and 13% of respondents nationally. Mean household firearm and handgun
ownership rates come from the General Social Surveys (1988­97).

Compared with males, females have higher rates of both
current and lifetime depression, higher rates of suicidal
thoughts and suicidal attempts, but lower rates of suicide.
Unfortunately, the NCS is not large enough to allow us to con-
fidently disaggregate regional mental health measures by
gender or age to get precise estimates to include in our analy-
sis.
The strengths of our ecological study are that we use a good
measure of handgun ownership levels, and we are the first to
control for mental health risk factors. Our main results are
consistent with case-control studies that find that a handgun
or other firearm in the home is a risk factor for suicide, even
after accounting for various measures of mental health.14­18 We
find that in regions with higher levels of household handgun
ownership, there are higher rates of firearm suicide, lower
rates of non-firearm suicide (suggesting substitution of meth-
ods), and higher rates of overall suicide. This positive
association between handgun prevalence and overall suicide
across regions cannot be explained by differences in levels of
two indicators of mental health problems--lifetime preva-
lence of major depression or suicidal thoughts.

Key points
Across US regions:
· Handgun ownership rates are associated with suicide rates.
· Handgun ownership rates are not associated with rates of
lifetime major depression.
· Handgun ownership rates are not associated with rates of
lifetime serious suicidal thoughts.
· Rates of depression and suicidal thoughts cannot account
for the handgun-suicide connection.
