Are HMO Enrollees Healthier
Than Others? Results From The
Community Tracking Study
Not necessarily. Cost considerations and age can be more important
than health status in decisions to enroll in an HMO.
by Elizabeth Schaefer and James D. Reschovsky
ABSTRACT: This analysis addresses the question of biased selection into health mainte-
nance organizations (HMOs) by using recent, nationally representative data from the Com-
munity Tracking Study (CTS) to compare the health status of nonelderly privately insured
persons enrolled in HMO and non-HMO plans. Contrary to the conventional view that HMOs
receive favorable selection, we find among the privately insured that HMO enrollees are not
healthier and may be slightly less healthy. To help understand that result, we present evi-
dence suggesting that other factors, including cost considerations, may be more important
than health when people are deciding whether to enroll in an HMO.
Many point to the lower premiums often associated with health
maintenance organizations (HMOs) to suggest that HMOs offer a way
to help control rising U.S. health care costs. However, HMOs' ability to
control costs depends on how they achieve lower premiums. To the extent that
their cost advantage is the result of favorable selection in enrollment rather than
efficiencies in health care delivery and lower payments to providers, their poten-
tial to serve as a remedy for high health care spending is limited.1 The conventional
view, arising perhaps from a subset of prior studies or from assumptions about the
preferences of people in poor health, seems to be that HMOs do enroll a generally
lower-risk population. Although considerable evidence suggests that this is true
for the Medicare and Medicaid populations, there is only mixed evidence for the
privately insured--the majority of the insured population.2
This analysis investigates the question of biased selection in HMOs by using re-
cent, nationally representative data from the Community Tracking Study (CTS)
to compare the health status of nonelderly privately insured persons enrolled in
HMO and non-HMO plans.3 Contrary to the conventional view about biased se-
lection in HMOs overall, we do not find among the privately insured that HMO
enrollees tend to be healthier than non-HMO enrollees.

n Background and framework. We use the term biased selection to indicate that
one type of health insurance plan enrolls persons who on average are better or worse
risks than enrollees in other types of plans. In empirical analyses of biased selection,
enrollee risk is typically approximated using a measure highly correlated with risk,
such as health status or health care use.
Despite the conventional view that HMOs receive favorable selection, there is
no clear theoretical prediction about whether this actually occurs. For example, in
the hypothetical situation where everyone has a choice between HMO and
non-HMO options, people who are in worse health, and who therefore expect to
have many visits to health care providers, may prefer HMO plans because of their
typically lower per visit cost sharing.4 On the other hand, people in worse health
may place greater weight on maintaining established ties to particular providers,
and so they may prefer non-HMO plans, which impose fewer or no restrictions on
provider visits. In addition, people in poor health may tend to avoid HMOs be-
cause of commonly held beliefs that managed care plans provide worse quality of
care.5 Thus, either favorable or adverse selection may arise depending on how peo-
ple in poor health weigh lower cost sharing in HMOs against their restrictiveness
and perhaps perceived lower quality.
Biased selection could also arise from correlations between health status and
other characteristics that are related to preferences between HMO and non-HMO
plans. For example, older people may be less familiar with managed care or more
likely to have long-standing relationships with providers. Since older people also
tend to be in worse health, non-HMOs could receive adverse selection simply be-
cause their method of care delivery is especially appealing to this group. Similarly,
people with lower incomes may prefer HMOs because of the lower premiums and
cost sharing, and therefore HMOs could receive adverse selection because of the
fact that lower income is often associated with worse health.6
Although it is commonly assumed that biased selection results from consumers'
choices among plans, not everyone has the same opportunity to exercise such a
choice.7 To address this, we investigate health status differences for three distinct
groups of privately insured persons with different plan-choice opportunities:
those in the individual market, those with employer-sponsored insurance and a
choice of HMO and non-HMO plans, and those with employer-sponsored insur-
ance but no choice. Biased selection is least likely to be observed in this last group,
although it may still occur if workers select jobs on the basis of the type of health
plan offered or if employers choose to offer HMO or non-HMO plans based in part
on workers' health status. Although this is not a formal analysis of consumer or
employer decision making, separate analysis of these three groups allows us a
fuller understanding of the factors behind the overall health status differences be-
tween HMO and non-HMO enrollees.
n Previous research. There is a large literature that examines biased selection in
HMOs, and others have already reviewed this literature in detail.8 Conventional

wisdom that HMOs experience favorable selection may be based on results for just
the Medicare and Medicaid populations, which consistently show that HMO en-
rollees are lower risks.9 That view could also have developed from the results of a
subset of the studies of the privately insured, as discussed below.
Many of the studies that focus on nonelderly persons with private insurance,
which is the population of interest for this analysis, use samples of employees, typ-
ically at a single large employer, who have a choice of different types of plans. Most
of these studies analyze measures of health care use (from either before or after the
enrollment choice was made, and sometimes represented by expenditures), and
they find that people with lower use tend to enroll in HMOs.10 However, those re-
sults cannot necessarily be used to conclude that HMOs receive favorable selec-
tion, for several reasons. First, the relationship between low utilization and choice
of an HMO plan is not universal.11 In addition, many of these studies rely on mea-
sures of health care use in the period prior to choosing a health plan, and there is
evidence suggesting that such measures may tend to overstate the differences in
use between the plan types in subsequent periods because of regression to the
mean.12 Lastly, because these studies use samples that come from only a few em-
ployers, the ability to generalize from the results is limited.
Another common approach to this topic is to use nationally representative sur-
vey data and measures of health status.13 The studies using this approach find few
statistically significant health status differences between enrollees in HMOs and
non-HMOs, and those differences go in both directions, with some health status
measures indicating that HMOs receive favorable selection and others indicating
adverse selection. Our analysis is most similar to this set of studies.
Data And Methods
n Data source. The data come from the Community Tracking Study (CTS)
1998­99 Household Survey, a large nationally representative survey of the civilian
noninstitutionalized population that tracks changes in the health care system
through periodic surveys and site visits.14 The survey collected data on approxi-
mately 59,000 persons between August 1998 and October 1999, using telephone in-
terviews that included questions on health insurance coverage, sociodemographic
characteristics, and health status.15
n Population groups. This analysis uses a subsample of about 34,900 nonelderly
persons with private health insurance coverage, of whom 54 percent were enrolled
in HMOs and 46 percent in other types of plans. HMO enrollment is defined by the
response to a question about whether the plan is an HMO.16 Thus, the sample of
HMO enrollees is likely to include enrollees in point-of-service (POS) products,
since these are typically marketed as HMOs with a POS option. These enrollment
percentages are in line with results from other surveys, which show approximately
50 percent combined enrollment in POS and traditional HMO products.17
We analyze results separately for the following three groups: people with em-

ployer-sponsored insurance who had a choice between an HMO and a non-HMO
(45 percent of the privately insured), people with employer-sponsored insurance
but no choice between plan types (47 percent), and people with nongroup insur-
ance (7 percent). To define whether an HMO/non-HMO choice was available for
each person, information is used on the health insurance plans offered by the em-
ployers of all adults in the person's family.
n Health status measures. We used four health status measures to ensure that
our results are robust. Each is an indicator of whether an enrollee's health status is
below a certain threshold.18 Two indicators, overall poor physical health and poor
mental health, are based on the physical and mental health summary scores from the
SF-12, which are available only for adults.19 Poor physical health is identified by a
physical health summary score below the twentieth percentile for the general U.S.
population, and poor mental health is defined analogously. The third measure indi-
cates whether the respondent's self-assessed health status is fair or poor (as opposed
to excellent, very good, or good). The final measure is the presence of any chronic
conditions that are considered expensive to treat.20
We first present results for the prevalence of poor health status among HMO
and non-HMO enrollees. Then, because health status is correlated with many ba-
sic sociodemographic variables, we use logit models to estimate the independent
effect of health on the probability of a person's being enrolled in an HMO.21 We
show the marginal effects from those logit models for the sample with employer-
sponsored insurance and a choice between HMO and non-HMO plan types.
Lastly, we present HMO/non-HMO differences in attitudes about trading off lower
out-of-pocket costs for health care against limitations on choice of providers.
n Data limitations. Two data limitations should be noted. The first is that we
are evaluating biased selection using measures of health status, which is only an in-
direct measure of risk and propensity to use services. The second is that these re-
sults may be affected by misreporting of plan type by household survey respon-
dents.22 However, such misreporting would affect our results only if its direction
varied by health status, and our analysis of additional data in which plan type is
identified by health plans indicates that misreporting has not affected our results.23
Study Results
n Health status and plan type. Among the privately insured, HMOs do not re-
ceive favorable selection (Exhibit 1). Although the differences are not large, HMOs
have a higher percentage of enrollees in poor health for three of the four health status
measures. The recent growth in HMOs with a POS option providing at least some
out-of-network coverage raises the possibility that favorable selection in traditional
HMOs is being obscured by adverse selection in the less-restrictive POS products.
Although the data used in this analysis cannot address that question, a supplement
to an earlier year of these data can, and it shows no evidence of health status differ-
ences between POS-model and traditional HMOs.24

Exhibit 1 also examines whether the small health status differences overall are
masking any strong HMO/non-HMO health status patterns within any of our
three subsamples. We might expect biased selection primarily among the sub-
samples of individually insured and people with employer coverage and a choice of
plan types, because for them plan type can most directly reflect enrollees' prefer-
ences. In fact, none of the health status differences for those two subsamples is
statistically significant. The remaining subsample of those with employer-spon-
sored insurance but no choice of plan types does have significant differences, but
there is no compelling interpretation for that, because only two differences are
significant and the magnitudes are not large. Therefore, at least according to these
simple descriptive results, it appears that enrollees' health status is not strongly
related to choice of plans.
n Health status and plan type, controlling for other factors. To explore these
descriptive results, we use multivariate analysis to estimate the independent effect
of health on the probability of HMO enrollment for the full sample of adults, con-

on the probability of HMO enrollment, although the effect is significant at p < .05 for
only two of the four health measures.
Because the full sample combines persons who face very different types of
health insurance choices, we reestimated the models on just the subsample of
adults with employer-sponsored coverage and a choice between HMO and
non-HMO plans, to better assess the factors most important in the decision about
whether to enroll in an HMO (Exhibit 2). We show only the estimated marginal

models using the three other measures of health status differed little.
Health status did not have a significant effect on the likelihood of HMO enroll-
ment for those with a choice of plan types. However, other factors did. For exam-
ple, age had a significant negative effect, which could reflect the fact that older
people are less familiar with HMOs. Income also had a significant negative effect,
which supports the notion that those with lower incomes are attracted to HMOs'
lower cost-sharing requirements. Overall, for this sample, the lack of large signifi-
cant effects of any of the measures of health status, combined with the significant
effects of income, suggests that nonelderly people with private insurance put more
weight on cost considerations than on health status when choosing coverage.
We also tried including interactions between the health and income variables
in the basic model shown in Exhibit 2, to investigate whether health effects might
exist only at certain income levels (results not shown). In particular, people with
higher incomes may be the only ones who can afford to take their health status
into consideration when choosing a health plan. Our results, however, provide no
evidence that the effect of health on the probability of HMO enrollment varies at
different levels of income.

greater willingness to trade the freedom to choose any provider for lower out-of-
pocket costs. This is not surprising, since one of the most basic features of HMOs is
to lower costs by restricting choice of providers. The fact that the differences be-
tween HMO and non-HMO enrollees are more pronounced for people with a choice
of plan types than for those without reinforces our finding that cost considerations
can be an important factor in HMO enrollment decisions.
Discussion
Our analysis has found little biased selection in HMOs among the privately in-
sured, with HMOs tending to have slightly more enrollees in poor health. This re-
sult is contrary to the conventional wisdom that HMOs receive favorable selec-
tion, although it is generally consistent with other similar studies. To the extent
that health status represents risk, these studies in aggregate, based on data span-
ning 1977 through 1998, suggest that HMOs have not been receiving favorable selec-
tion among their nonelderly enrollees for quite some time, if in fact they ever did.
These results make a noteworthy contribution to the literature on biased selec-
tion in HMOs. First, our measure of choice captures all employer coverage avail-
able through the family instead of just what is available from a person's own em-
ployer, and we use this information to identify that segment of the population
among which biased selection is most likely to be observed. In addition, we have
direct information on attitudes about trading off more limited provider choice for
lower out-of-pocket spending, which confirms our multivariate results indicating
that cost plays an important role in the HMO enrollment decision. Lastly, the use
of timely data in this analysis is important, since many recent developments in the
health insurance market could have affected biased selection among the privately
insured, such as the growth in HMO enrollment, changes in employers' health in-
surance offerings, and changes in managed care products.26
Our results imply that, at least for the privately insured, lower HMO costs can-
not be attributed simply to enrollment of a healthier population. Rather, at least
some of HMOs' cost advantages are likely attributable to lower utilization associ-
ated with care management tools or to lower fees paid to providers.
Our results also suggest that factors other than health status play a role in peo-
ple's decisions about whether to enroll in an HMO. In particular, our finding of in-
come's strong negative effect on HMO enrollment decisions suggests that people
are influenced by HMOs' lower costs. This is reinforced by our finding that HMO
enrollees express a much greater willingness to benefit from lower out-of-pocket
costs in exchange for having restrictions on their choice of providers. Age also ap-
pears to be important in HMO enrollment, most likely reflecting older people's
lack of familiarity with HMOs. Together these results suggest that HMOs' ability
to attract better risks because of older people's unfamiliarity with them is offset by
their appeal to those with lower incomes, who tend to be worse risks.
The effectiveness of HMOs in reducing costs for consumers and the importance

of cost to consumers in their health insurance decisions have particular salience
today as we return to a period of large increases in health care costs among the pri-
vately insured.27 In the past few years a strong economy meant that labor markets
were tight, insulating employees from premium increases through employers'
willingness to absorb those increases to keep and attract workers. During that pe-
riod, consumers' and policymakers' complaints focused on the restrictions im-
posed by managed care plans, although as our data show, some people neverthe-
less still continued to choose HMOs because of their lower costs. However, we are
now seeing a weaker economy and looser labor markets, along with larger in-
creases in premiums. In this environment employers are far more likely to pass on
cost increases to their employees. As the privately insured once again face large
premium increases, our results suggest that cost may return to the forefront
among the complaints of privately insured consumers. This possibility should not
be forgotten in discussions about managed care regulations that may greatly in-
crease costs or restrict consumers' choice of health plan features. If the ultimate ef-
fect of such regulations is to reduce or eliminate some lower-cost health insurance
options, they may not be entirely welcome to all consumers.

12. Although medical spending levels in one year have been found to be positively correlated with spending in
subsequent years, the correlation is not high because of regression to the mean. See W.P. Welch, "Regres-
sion toward the Mean in Medical Care Costs: Implications for Biased Selection in Health Maintenance
Organizations," Medical Care 23, no. 11 (1985): 1234­1241.

15. The survey response rate was 63 percent. Weights account for possible systematic differences between re-
spondents and nonrespondents. The survey includes households without telephones.
16. Respondents were asked: "Is [plan name] an HMO, that is, a Health Maintenance Organization?"
17. J. Gabel et al., "Job-Based Health Insurance in 2000: Premiums Rise Sharply while Coverage Grows,"Health
Affairs (Sep/Oct 2000): 144­151, find 53 percent enrollment in HMO and POS plans in 1999; and M.S. Mar-
quis and S.H. Long, "Trends in Managed Care and Managed Competition, 1993­1997," Health Affairs
(Nov/Dec 1999): 75­88, find 48 percent enrollment in HMO and POS plans in 1997. Both studies used
samples of policyholders of employer-sponsored insurance.
18. This approach was chosen over using continuous versions of the measures because it allows easy compari-
son of results across measures and because using the continuous measures yielded similar results.

20. The conditions for adults are diabetes; rheumatoid arthritis; asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease; atrial fibrillation; ischemic heart disease; congestive heart failure; stroke; cancers of the breast, lung,
colon, or prostate; and HIV or AIDS. The conditions for children are sickle cell disease, tuberculosis,
asthma, and diabetes.
21. Each logit model includes one measure of health status and the following control variables: age, race, edu-
cation, income, sex, marital status, family size, and local market area.
22. Analysis of other data from the CTS found that 76 percent of people get correctly classified into the HMO
and non-HMO categories when using information from CTS Household Survey respondents. See J.D.
Reschovsky and J.L. Hargraves, "Health Care Perceptions and Experiences: It's Not Whether You Are in
an HMO, It's Whether You Think You Are," HSC Issue Brief no. 30 (Washington: HSC, 2000).
23. We used data from the CTS 1996­97 Household Survey and its supplement (the CTS Followback Survey),
which obtains information about the Household Survey respondents' health insurance directly from
health plans. We compared HMO/non-HMO results obtained using Household Survey reports of plan
type against results obtained using the Followback Survey reports of plan type. All results presented here
are virtually the same regardless of survey source.
