Introduction
Changing corporate environment may lead to severe organi-
zational inefficiencies. Several studies have developed typol-
ogies of environments. Shane (2005) focused on the
environmental change from a new approach. Shane classi-
fied the change into three categories, namely, technological,
political and regulatory, and social and demographic changes.
Hubert and Sofie (2008) introduced four sets of factors
related to environmental changes that can cause corporate
inefficiency. They categorized these factors into environ-
mental changes, immediate environment, management, cor-
porate policy, and corporate characteristics. Literature has
demonstrated that the type of corporate environment influ-
ences the shocks that the corporate may receive.
Environmental change and performance inefficiency affect
different aspects of a corporate including corporate strategy
and structure, and human resource management.
Dam construction companies in Iran are the complex ones
with frequent radical shocks. This kind of environment may,
anytime, receive corporate environmental shocks that reduce
the efficiency level. The Iranian Water and Power Resources
Development Company (IWPRDC) is the most important
dam construction corporation in Iran that has recently
received a number of serious environmental shocks espe-
cially in terms of a reduction in governmental budget and
performance inefficiency. The following are the main ques-
tions that IWPRDC managers have faced: (a) Which factors
reduce the performance of organization? (b) Which organi-
zational factors must be considered in the corporate diagno-
sis (CD) process in project-based companies?
According to the Weisbord's (1976) model, the main fac-
tors that must be considered in CD are strategy, structure,
system, and human resource management. But these items
are not comprehensive for CD in project-based companies
because this model omitted the projects' inefficiency. So, the
previous researches have weakness in providing a model that
covers the different factors that lead to inefficiency in proj-
ect-based companies. To fill the gap in the literature, this
article proposes a method for organizational diagnosis in
project-based companies. The main questions of this article
are as follows:
Question 1: Which factors must be considered in organi-
zational diagnosis in project-based companies?
Question 2: What are the sub-factors of them? In the
other words, which items may have had effect on these
considered factors?

Organizational Diagnosis in Project-Based
Companies: Challenges and Directions
Behrouz Zarei1, Yahya Chaghouee2, and Fereshteh Ghapanchi3
Abstract
The purpose of this article is to develop a new method for corporate diagnosis (CD). To this end, a method is developed
for the diagnosis process of project-based companies. The article presents a case study in a large company where data
have been collected through focus groups. Project delay, high project cost, and low profitability are examples of project
deficiency in project-based companies. Such issues have made managers pay special attention to find effective solutions
to improve them. Prominent factors are inappropriate strategy, structure, system, human resource management, and
PMBOK(Project Management Body of Knowledge) processes. Thus, CD and analysis is an important task in improvement
of corporate performance. The CD model that is developed in this article could be used for project-based companies. The
proposed method can be used for CD in any project-based company. This article provides an emphatic application of CD as
a prerequisite for restructuring in project-based companies.

The remainder of the article is organized as follows.
Section 2 provides a literature review on CD. Section 3
describes the research methodology and data sources.
Research findings are presented in Section 4 followed by
concluding remarks.
Literature Review
After representing the theory of systems in management,
drawing attention has been assigned to environmental
changes within the companies. Rapid changes on one hand
and great financial problems on the other hand, which com-
panies face, obliged the managers to assign the topics of
change management and organizational change in their pri-
oritization (Karimi, Khodaie, & Chaghouee, 2014). So,
research attributed the changes to corporate governance and
environments (Park & Kim, 2008).
Corporate in transition economies, have also pursued cor-
porate diagnosis and restructuring eagerly (Makhija, 2004)
and the importance assigned to the change process within the
companies has been formed the early a point of question:
what is the main cause of inefficiency within the companies?
To give a clear response to such question and because the
companies are seeking to improve operating efficiency,
increase cash flow, and, ultimately, enhance firm profitabil-
ity (Espen, 2008); the CD has been transformed as a manage-
rial necessity within the companies. Indeed, CD models help
the managers to recognize the weaknesses and efficiency
existing in the company, and then concentrate on the most
important cause and finally go through resolving it using an
in-depth planning (Karimi et al., 2014).
Corporate diagnosis is a process that involves the three
steps of publicly entering a human system, collecting valid
data about experiences, and feeding back to the system
toward promoting corporate performance (Wu, Dai, &
Magnier, 2010). Furthermore, Karimi et al (2014) has defined
corporate diagnosis such that "it is defined as a method to
analyze the organization aiming at defining organizational
deficiencies and planning to resolve them through organiza-
tional changes and development". Corporate diagnosis deals
with answering three questions: the causes of change (why),
the process of change (how), and the content of change
(what; Janiijevi, 2010). As noted by Janiijevi (2010),
when it comes to CD, studies in the area of corporate devel-
opment and changes are preoccupied with three main issues:
(a) development of corporate diagnostic model, (b) the
choice of procedures and methods for data collection of diag-
nosis (the methodology of CD), and (c) methods and tech-
niques of data processing and making conclusions.
A corporate diagnosis model is a representation of a cor-
porate that helps us identify its main components and rela-
tions between those components for the purpose of
understanding the corporate (as an object of change). The
models are represented in the chronological order in which
they first appeared in the literature as follows (Zali, Hosseini,
& Madhoshi, 2006):
1. Force Field Analysis (1951)
2. Leavitt's model (1965)
3. Likert system analysis (1967)
4. Open system theory (1966)
5. Weisbord's six-box model (1976)
6. Congruence model for organization analysis (1977)
7. Mckinsey 7s framework (1981-1982)
8. Tichy's technical political cultural (TPC) framework
(1983)
9. High-performance programming (1984)
10. Diagnosing individual and group behavior (1987)
11. Burke­Litwin model of organizational performance
and change (1992)
12. Falletta's organizational intelligence model (2008)
According to Weisbord's (1976) model and Mckinsey's
7s framework (Hanafizadeh and Ravasan, 2011): strategy,
structure, system, and human resource management are the
main factors that must be considered in CD. Despite the
emphasis of these past researches on these factors as the
prominent ones that must be assessed in diagnosis process, a
suitable method for corporate diagnosis in project-based
companies has not been prepared by previous researchers.
Herewith, we aim at filling the above-mentioned gap.
Research Methodology
Founded in 1989, the IWPRDC is considered as one of the
most prominent corporations in the field of dam construction
in Iran. The company has 900 qualified staffs. Due to envi-
ronmental changes (especially changes in governmental bud-
gets), IWPRDC has faced inefficiencies.
Herewith, the Delphi Method is selected as a research
method that accesses view of an expert group (Karimi,
Chaghouee, & Hamidpour, 2014; Karimi et al., 2014) for the
purpose of identifying causes of corporate inefficiency. As
described by Okoli and Pawlowski (2004), the Delphi
method involves three general steps: (a) brainstorming to
explore a list of important factors, (b) narrowing down the
original list to the most important ones, and (c) ranking the
list of factors.
The objective of the first phase is to extract the factors. In
this phase, a focus group was formed to determine the defi-
ciency factors. For the next two phases, we had experts in six
distinct panels. In brief, panels modified and narrowed down
the previous identified factors that reflected the causes of the
poor performance. While short-listing the factors in the second
phase, the expert panels rated the factors. The goal of the final
phase (Phase 3) was to reach a consensus within each panel on
the factor ranking. Data were collected through focus groups.
In the next section, the data collection process is explained.
Zarei et al. 3
In this research, focus group was used to collect data.
Focus groups are analytical challenges because they com-
bine three levels of data, including individual, group, and
group interaction (Duggleby, 2005). To analyze group
dynamics, we considered some of the questions designed by
Ingrid and Christine (2010), such as, "How closely did the
group adhere to the issues presented for discussion?" "What
were the contradictions in the discussions?" "What common
experiences were expressed?" and "Was a particular view
dominant?"
Focus groups offer an immediate reaction among the par-
ticipants as they negotiate and confront each other's views
(Kidd & Parshall, 2000). In this research, we sought agree-
ments among the panel members during the focus group ses-
sions and paid attention to disagreements.
The optimal size of a focus group to ensure a proper dis-
cussion is generally six to eight participants (Ingrid &
Christine, 2010). Here, we had a group of eight participants
who were randomly selected from the 20 top managers of
IWPRDC. We held 21 sessions in the corporate diagnosing
stage. The focus group sessions took 2 to 3 hr each, and they
were moderated by a moderator and an observer (co-
researcher). The primary role of the moderator was to initi-
ate, observe, facilitate, and conduct discussions among the
participants, while the observer took field notes and observed
non-verbal communication patterns among the participants.
The sessions were digitally recorded. Data from each focus
group session were analyzed by taking the following steps
(Ingrid & Christine, 2010):
1. Overview: reading the transcript several times to get
a grasp of the material.
2. De-contextualization: categorizing data according to
the main themes in the research guide.
3. Coding: organizing the text according to emerging
categories within each theme.
4. Conceptualization: identifying the main concepts in
the emerging codes and sub-codes.
5. Re-contextualization: re-arranging the text according
to the emerging logic.
6. Documentation: focus groups' participants were
selected to illustrate and validate the process of anal-
ysis in the next session.
Findings
In today's world, it is imperative to use cutting-edge tech-
nologies and tools (Ghapanchi, 2013; Ghapanchi & Aurum,
2012a; Ghapanchi, Jafarzadeh, & Khakbaz, 2008a, 2008b;
Ghapanchi, Tavana, Khakbaz, & Low, 2012; Najaftorkaman,
Ghapanchi, Talaei-Khoei, & Ray, 2013) to assist companies
achieve their goals and objectives. This can also assist com-
panies' executives in their decision making (Ghapanchi &
Aurum, 2012a, 2012b; Khakbaz, Ghapanchi, & Tavana,
2010). In this research, we undertook an in-depth study of
the inefficiency in IWPRDC, and found five sets of corporate
inefficiency. To make this classification, we utilized the
Weisbord (1978) and Mckinsey (1981-1982) models,
PMBOK standard, and interviews with key figures of the
corporation. Table 1 shows different categories of corporate
inefficiency.
The semantic network shown in Figure 1 illustrates the
relationship between inefficiency categories. Figure 1 dem-
onstrates "corporate inefficiency," "Is-From" (I-F), and fac-
tors A, B, C, D and E. This figure shows which inefficiency
factor "Is-From" or "Can-Affect" the other group. For exam-
ple, factors in category A can affect B, C, and D categories.
In addition to external relationships between categories, it
is valuable to determine the relationship between elements of
each category. In Figure 1, these relations are shown with
"Result-In" (R-I) and "Can-Affect" (C-A) connections,
which demonstrate how the emergence of a problem in one
category leads to inefficiency in other places. Therefore, it is
required to identify the sub-categories in each category (as
depicted in Table 2).

Figure 2 illustrates relationships among five major cate-
gories of the corporate inefficiency sources. "Result-In"
(R-I) is a concept that we have used here to demonstrate the
relationship between factors contributing to deficiency in
each group. Uncovering such relationships, which are often
hidden, is of great value to the management of the company.
To make it clear, we make an example. Group D includes
seven sub-categories. "Absence or low clarity of personnel
duties" (Factor 2) can "result in" some problems like "defi-
ciencies of human resource management" (Factor 3).
"Weakness in recognition of personnel training needs"
(Factor 7) may cause "deficiencies of personnel training pro-
grams" (Factor 4). Also, this network shows that a problem
like "deficiencies of human resource management" (Factor
3) results from "inefficiency of human resource rules"
(Factor 5). Moreover, "inefficiency of personnel motivation
and encouragement methods" (Factor 6) can "result in" some
problems like "deficiencies of human resource management"
(Factor 3).
An important aspect of collected data is the frequency of
factors and their ranking (see Table 3). According to Table 3,
the prominent causes of inefficiency in IWPRDC are struc-
ture problems (M = 4, N = total number of experts in six
panels = 48). Furthermore, the main sub-factors are E-3 (fre-
quency = 43), C-1 (frequency = 42), and E-5 (frequency =
41). It also indicates that the deficiency of corporate struc-
ture and the weakness of PMBOK project processes (espe-
cially the poor controlling and closing processes) are the
main corporate deficiency factor.
Concluding Remarks
This article is an endeavor to highlight the causes of corpo-
rate inefficiency in project-based companies and illustrates
how such agents might threat them, such as our case study
(i.e., IWPRDC). Discovering the deficiency causes and their
internal/external relationships can yield several benefits to
the corporate management. This article attempted to illus-
trate the main deficiency sources through conducting a study
on structure effects and presenting the results of an in-depth
study of the IWPRDC.
According to first question of this study, sources of corpo-
rate inefficiency are categorized into five groups: strategy,
system, structure, HRM, and PMBOK processes. The part
also presented acquired data through a semantic network and
depicted internal and external relationships between the
causes of deficiency. It means that during the corporate diag-
nosis in companies that are implementing some projects, the
managers and researchers must consider these factors and
evaluate them for their effect on reduction of corporate
performance.
In addition to the second question, the following items are
demonstrated as sub-factors, which must be checked during
corporate diagnosis in project-based companies:
1. Strategy: human resource management strategy,
financial management strategy, supervision and con-
trol strategy
2. System: project supply system, financial preparation
and control system, projects preparation and control
system, quality management system, contractors and
advisors' assessment and selection system, system
integration and knowledge management system

Finally, this article demonstrates a method for identifica-
tion of factor and sub-factors that cause the inefficiency in
project-based companies and introduced a Semantic Network
of inefficiency causes for cause-and-effect analysis of con-
sidered sub-factors. Based on the result of this, in IWPRDC,
the main item that must be considered for reduction of inef-
ficiency is structure. So, the implementation of a restructur-
ing project is advised to the managers.
This research is not free of limitations. Due to time con-
straints, in this study, we examined the proposed CD model
only in one Iranian project-based company. Further research
would be necessary to evaluate and modify this model by
utilization in different kinds of project-based companies in
other countries.
