Introduction
Mozambique is among the countries most affected by the
HIV/AIDS epidemic. By 2011, nearly 1.5 million of its popu-
lation (all ages) and approximately 130,000 children below the
age of 15 years were living with HIV orAIDS (United Nations
Children's Fund [UNICEF], 2012). Mother-to-child HIV
transmission is a devastating consequence of the spread of
HIV. To respond to this problem, the Mozambique Ministry of
Health rapidly expanded HIV-related care services to prevent
mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV and care for
infants born to HIV-infected mothers, including the provision
of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, HIV early diagnosis by
Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase Chain Reaction (DNA
PCR), and antiretroviral treatment (ART). Despite this com-
mitment, the health system has had limited success in provid-
ing care to HIV-exposed children. Although national data
suggest treatment is increasing, the 2009 figures account for
only 19% of eligible children receivingART (UNICEF, 2009).
One reason for low coverage of HIV care interventions
among HIV-exposed infants is the high rate of loss to follow-
up (LTFU) of these children in postnatal HIV care. Based on
routine program data from HIV treatment clinics in Beira,
the capital of Sofala Province in Mozambique, approxi-
mately 60% of HIV-positive pregnant women and 50% of
HIV-exposed children miss >3 successive clinic visits. Other
studies in sub-Saharan Africa found similarly low follow-up
rates among HIV-positive women and their infants in post-
partum care (Jones, Sherman, & Varga, 2005; Manzi et al.,
2005; Wiktor et al., 1999).
Several issues may contribute to LTFU among HIV-
exposed infants, including health system factors (e.g., long
waiting times, disrespectful treatment by health staff, and
uncoordinated referrals between different HIV services; Braun
et
al., 2011; Orner et
al., 2008) and patient factors (e.g.,
chronic illness, family responsibilities, forgetfulness, lack of
understanding, and distrust of health staff; Robiner & Keel,
1997; Robiner, Yozwiak, Bearman, Strand, & Strasburg,
2009). Transportation costs, inadequate spousal or family sup-
port, and fear of HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination
may discourage women from seeking care (Jones etal., 2005;

Abstract
Loss to follow-up contributes to the low coverage of HIV care interventions among HIV-exposed infants in Beira, Mozambique.
This qualitative study explores the perceptions of HIV-infected women and their health care providers regarding the main
obstacles preventing women from attending follow-up visits for HIV care, and factors influencing women's decisions about
newborn care. Fifty-two in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions were conducted; transcripts were coded and
analyzed using ATLAS.ti. Interviewees perceived three major barriers to follow-up: food insecurity, difficulties navigating the
health system, and women's familial roles and responsibilities. Our findings unveil the complex context in which HIV-infected
women and their children live, and suggest that the structure and function of the HIV care system should be reviewed.
Economic empowerment of women is crucial to achieving better compliance with medical care. Integration of mother and
child services and more efficient and culturally sensitive medical services may improve follow-up.

Maman, 2007; Manzi etal., 2005; Painter etal., 2005). Finally,
structural factors, including the physical, social, cultural, orga-
nizational, community, economic, or policy aspects of the
environment, can act as barriers or facilitators to individually
oriented HIV prevention and care services (Blankenship, Bray,
& Merson, 2000; Farmer, 2004; Farmer, Leandre, etal., 2001;
Gupta, Parkhurst, Ogden, Aggleton, & Mahal, 2008; Jones
etal., 2005; Parker, Easton, & Klein, 2000; Sumartojo, Doll,
Holtgrave, Gayle, & Merson, 2000).
However, few data have been systematically collected in
Mozambique on the conditions that affect the lives of HIV-
positive women and their children on a daily basis, and how
these conditions affect their acceptance and utilization of
HIV care services. We therefore conducted a qualitative
study to determine the factors affecting women's decision to
seek HIV care and adhere to follow-up visits for themselves
and their newborn babies.
Method
We conducted a cross-sectional qualitative study of a subset of
women participating in an observational cohort study of nevi-
rapine (NVP) resistance following prophylaxis with single-
dose nevirapine, which started in June 2005 and ended in
December 2008 (Micek et
al., 2010). Briefly, the study
enrolled mothers and newborn infants participating in PMTCT
programs at three clinics in Beira, Mozambique. Infants were
supposed to make five study visits through 8 weeks of age, at
which time questionnaires were administered and blood sam-
ples taken for analysis of HIV infection and NVP resistance
(Blankenship etal., 2000). Similar to the PMTCT program
from which participants were recruited, study-related follow-
up of infants was poor, with 57% (499/875) of enrolled infants
missing >2 successive scheduled study visits. We investigated
the reasons for LTFU in this already assembled cohort of
mothers and infants, to provide insights into the reasons for
LTFU within PMTCT programs.
Two techniques were used to systematically collect data:
individual in-depth interviews (IDIs) with patients and clinic
staff, and focus group discussions (FGDs) with patients. A
purposive sampling strategy was used to select participants,
stratified primarily by the quality of their study follow-up:
1. mother/infant pairs who participated in the NVP-
resistance study and had good follow-up (missing
less than two sequentially scheduled visits),
2. mother/infant pairs who participated in the NVP-
resistance study and had poor follow-up (missing
more than 2 successive scheduled visits),
3. mother/infant pairs who only attended the first study
visit (early losses),
4. mother/infant pairs who refused participation in the
NVP-resistance study but were registered at the HIV
clinic,
5. mother/infant pairs whose infants were determined
HIV-positive, and
6. clinic workers and study staff involved in the atten-
dance/care of women and children
Interviews focused on exploring the main obstacles pre-
venting women from attending study visits, as well as fol-
low-up with HIV care. Interviews also sought to elicit factors
that influence women's decisions about newborn care, and
identify barriers and facilitators of care and of initiating ART
for eligible infants.
Preliminary analysis of the information obtained in the
IDIs was followed by two FGDs: one including mother/
infant pairs with good follow-up and the other including
mother/infant pairs with poor follow-up. The goal of these
FGDs was to generate debate on recurrent themes that
emerged from IDIs.
Interview and FGD data were tape-recorded, and tran-
scriptswerecodedandanalyzedusingATLAS.ti.Independent
informed consent was obtained from all study respondents.
The study was approved by the institutional review boards
from the Mozambique National Institute of Health (Maputo,
Mozambique) and Seattle Children's Hospital (Seattle,
Washington, USA).
Results
Fifty-two IDIs were conducted, including 42 with mother/
infant pairs, 6 with clinic staff, and 4 with study staff (Table 1).
Two FGDs were performed: One included seven individuals
with good follow-up and the other six individuals with poor
follow-up. All infants of the mother/infant pairs participating
in the FGDs were registered at an HIV clinic that provided
care for HIV-exposed or infected infants.
An array of factors identified by women and health staff
were perceived as important barriers to follow-up study and
clinic visits, and to the acceptability of services. Figure 1
lists all these factors and attempts to represent schematically
the iterative and synergistic interactions among them.
Among the factors identified by respondents, three major
themes pertaining to women accessing health care repeatedly
emerged, independent of the degree of follow-up: food inse-
curity, difficulties navigating a health system perceived as
dysfunctional, and women's familial roles and responsibili-
ties. Further analysis of these three interrelated themes,
including specific issues around each, is highlighted below.
Theme 1: Food Insecurity and the Trade-Offs in
Women's Daily Life
The struggle for daily survival. Issues related to food insecurity
were common among all participants, and appeared to be
inextricably linked to women's choices for continuing HIV
care and complying with follow-up visits. In particular, this
Blanco et al. 3
issue represented the strongest and most prevailing barrier
for all respondents who had poor adherence to follow-up vis-
its. The struggle to get food is a daily constraint among the
women interviewed, who often referred to feeling so weak
and desperate for not having stable means of feeding them-
selves and their children--many of whom were also ill. The
first excerpt in Figure 2 from the IDI of a woman taking ART
illustrates this situation.
Time spent going to the clinic versus time getting money to buy
food. Acommon dilemma mentioned by women was whether
to devote time to get food versus spend time going to the
clinic. Women frequently have to help generate income for
their families through informal businesses that are based on
an unstable economy of subsistence. Common small busi-
nesses (biscatos) mentioned by women as a daily means of
subsistence included the sale of charcoal processed by them
from purchased firewood, the sale of sand gathered on the
beach to be used to make concrete for construction (an activ-
ity punishable by city officials), the sale of purchased fish,
the sale of nipa (a home-brewed alcoholic beverage), and the
sale of produce from their farms (machambas) (Figure 2).

Seasonal work and other household responsibilities. Of the 42
interviewed women, 36 were engaged in some kind of agri-
cultural activity, either for household consumption or for
selling. Because Beira's sandy soil is not fertile, many mach-
ambas are located far from the city. Taking care of their
machambas is done regularly throughout the year, but the
time devoted to this activity usually varies depending on the
season and distance to the fields. Thus, because most women
do not have money to afford public or other transportation,
they are required to walk long journeys to get to their crops.
The duration of visits to the machambas may range from 1 to
3 days per week.
Fetching water for their households was another manda-
tory daily activity requiring their time and resources. Most
mothers expressed that their household tasks and subsistence
activities did not leave time for any additional tasks. Thus,
attending the clinic for care or a study was only possible if
they sacrificed other responsibilities.
Food aid: a social conflict at clinics.Food insecurity has also
become a social problem at health facilities as health workers
need to restrict and prioritize beneficiaries of food aid. A
recurrent barrier that emerged in several IDIs and FGDs was
corruption in the distribution of food aid. Nearly all respon-
dents, including clinic staff, expressed acknowledgment of
episodes where nurses or other health staff manipulated
recipients of food aid or received bribes to sell food origi-
nally intended for patients with HIV/AIDS. The narratives
excerpted in Figure 3 illustrate how this issue permeates the
dynamics of health facilities.
Clinic and study staff questioned about corrupt practices
acknowledged that graft is frequent and systematic.
Marketing of items intended as aid is performed clandes-
tinely but accepted as a common way to procure extra income
for health staff households. Most of them felt that it was a
consequence of meager salaries given to state employees.
Use of transportation subsidies for other household needs.Trans-
portation subsidies were provided as part of the NVP-resis-
tance study for women to attend follow-up study visits.
However, women participating in this study who had poor
follow-up frequently mentioned using the transportation
money for other household needs, mainly food. As a conse-
quence, the woman could not afford transportation to the
subsequent study visit.
Theme 2: Difficulties Navigating a Dysfunctional
Health System
Most interviewed women identified the rudeness of health
care providers and the incomprehensible flow of care as bar-
riers to attending follow-up visits at the HIV clinic. Women
perceived the clinic staff to be overloaded, unmotivated, and
poorly trained. Furthermore, staff members were frequently
accused of lacking compassion in their interactions with
patients. In the interviews, mothers described several exam-
ples of disrespectful treatment of patients, including verbal
and nonverbal derogatory and discriminatory practices
(Figure 4).
An erratic flow of services was described by women
during interviews and FGDs. Women complained about
having separate appointments for themselves and their
babies at the pediatric and adult HIV clinics, with most of
the appointments within only a few days of each other.
They also told of going back and forth between different

trade-off in women's daily life.
. . . It is different for a healthy person, they can eat whenever
they want; instead, I have the obligation of eating everyday
because I'm sick and taking pills.That's my concern, so much
suffering is coming into my life, and it's so hard to get some-
thing to eat. If I have something for breakfast it might not be
possible to get something for lunch.
I don't have the time to be at the hospital so often mainly
because I don't have a fixed schedule for my"biscatos".From
time to time I have to buy fish at midnight because there is
no schedule for this. Any time fishermen bring fish at the
beach I have to go there to purchase it, then I have to salt it
and spread it till dry while bringing the rest to sell in the
market.
The nurse said: you came here because you heard that here
we are providing food. I replied no, I'm here because I have a
follow-up consultation, not because of the food. I didn't even
know there was something related to food aid distribution . .
.The nurse said: only the ones who have cards will receive
something, who has lost the card should get a new one, then
I said I lost mine when my things were stolen, and then she
replied,none of my business,there is no more food here,I can
see it is food what you are looking for.
I received only soy flour not the other food products they said
we should receive . . . only soy, a thing that I don't even know
how to prepare porridge with it. But it's difficult to discuss
with those people working at the health center . . . by chance
you meet a person who has five, eight cards to receive food .
. . can you see?
After having paid the bribe, they brought me a sac of flour . .
. then I realized that it was a business, that we, the patients,
are only getting the last part, we only receive flour . . . so it
ended up being a business of clinic workers, using aid food
for the patients.

clinic rooms or wards (i.e., social worker, pharmacy, nurse
who interprets CD4 results, multiple blood draws at labs,
etc.). Many women claimed they had not had a consulta-
tion with a medical doctor since their registration at the
HIV clinic. Many of those who had seen a doctor men-
tioned having several appointments canceled after waiting
entire days for a doctor who never arrived or in other cases
waiting for a late doctor who never offered an apology for
the delay.
Most public health facilities in Mozambique, including all
three clinics where this study took place, are extremely busy
early in the morning but nearly empty in the afternoons
(Figure 4).
Theme 3: Women's Familial Roles and
Household Responsibilities
Many women reported that illness, either in close relatives or
themselves, prevented them from attending the HIV clinic.
This issue was raised among all women whose babies were
HIV infected, but also frequently by women whose babies
were not infected (Figure 5).
Despite the fact that women felt they were primarily in
charge of their children's health care, the decision to seek
medical care was usually a family decision. Women were
socially expected to consult their husbands, mothers-in-law, or
other relatives before seeking care for themselves and their
children. Nonetheless, when their children were sick, some
women said that they had the primary responsibility of procur-
ing money to bring the child to the clinic, bringing food to the
child while hospitalized, or even paying for the treatment.
Women with an HIV-infected child who had not disclosed
their own HIV infection status to their partners had difficulties
justifying frequent visits to the health facility. Fear of domestic
violence and stigma from their families and communities pre-
vented them from utilizing HIV care services (Figure 5).
Many mothers reported that they sought care for their
children from diverse health providers concurrently. Women
believe traditional healing practices are important for their
children's health; however, most of them opted to attend
public health facilities first because traditional healers and
other informal health providers request higher payments than
public health facilities.
Discussion
Our qualitative study explored the perceptions of HIV-
infected postpartum women and their health care providers
regarding the primary barriers to maternal and infant compli-
ance with medical newborn care in Beira, Mozambique.
Non-adherence to infants' clinic visits appeared primarily
due to (a) women's full-time obligation to help gain food for
the family, (b) unpleasant and ineffectual past experiences
with the health care system, and (c) stigma related to HIV
within family units. Our findings unveil the complex context
in which HIV-infected women and their children live and
function on a daily basis. Furthermore, our findings suggest
that the structure and function of the HIV care system imple-
mented by the state and supported by non-governmental
organizations should be reviewed.
Although important programmatic goals related to HIV
services have been attained in Sofala Province (80,000
people are registered in HIV care and 18,000 have started
ART free of charge in more than 39 public health facilities
at the time of this study; HAI, 2009), overall living condi-
tions in central Mozambique remain extremely difficult for
people living with HIV/AIDS (Kalofonos, 2008). Indeed, a
significant body of literature has identified poverty as a
main socioeconomic force behind the HIV epidemic
(Farmer, 2004; Farmer, Connors, & Simmons, 1996; Kim
& Millen, 2002; Parker etal., 2000; Singer, 1998). These
reports highlight that other forms of social inequality,
instability, and discrimination synergize with poverty to
When I asked if I was going to be attended, the nurse told
me: hey don't bother me it was not me who passed you that
disease, you have to wait.
The problem at this hospital is that almost always the health
workers leave early.Around noon, patients are already being
dispatched.For example that mom was waiting for a visit the
whole day; it is 1 pm now and she was asked to come back
another day . . . clinic staff as well as all state workers need
to go out to procure extra-money, because government sala-
ries are not enough to sustain their families.
We know lots of drugs are donated to benefit poor people
who don't have the possibility to afford them,but when these
drugs get to the clinics, instead of being received by the peo-
ple who are entitled to, they ended up filling other pockets.
Figure 4. Barriers faced at the health system.
I haven't come because my child has been repeatedly very
sick. He coughs all the time.This may be because during the
nights I have to sell fried fish in the street for those who are
drinking in the bar and I must bring him with me. He cannot
bear this temperature. He frequently has a cold and I have
to take care of him.
Yesterday night, my mother was drunk; she insulted me and
yelled at me. She said:`I guess you have AIDS but you don´t
want to tell me the truth. I´ve seen you waste a lot of time
going to the hospital and your child is always taking
medications . . .

exacerbate the risk of HIV and vulnerability of those who
become infected. Our findings regarding the health care
system are in agreement with previous research done
around the world, showing that structural factors interfere
with effective care of HIV infection (Blankenship etal.,
2000; Farmer, 2004; Farmer, Leandre, etal., 2001; Gupta
etal., 2008; Parker etal., 2000; Sumartojo etal., 2000).
Social analysts have increasingly called for an evaluation
of the health care system and have advocated a shift of
resources to focus intervention primarily on the economic,
social, and environmental factors that are thought to under-
lie the HIV epidemic (Loforte, 2007; Parker etal., 2000).
In Mozambique, where cash income is increasingly
important for survival, the informal economy has become
vital for women, particularly in urban areas (Inge, Paulo, &
Montserrat, 2008). The Mozambican women in our study
were expected to accomplish multiple daily tasks that
included procuring cash to cover their subsistence needs,
providing child and family care, gathering water for daily
consumption, and cooking. These tasks and responsibilities
prevented them from attending to medical care for their
infants at the frequency currently recommended by the HIV
care system. Importantly, women's responsibilities have
been demonstrated to include a heavier workload and lower
cash returns compared with men, with significant ramifica-
tions on their well-being and decision making regarding their
and their child's health care (Parker etal., 2000). As reported
by our study participants, others have found that attending
frequent clinical appointments jeopardizes household food
security when women's activities are diverted from food pro-
duction (Kerr, 2005).
The link between poverty, food insecurity, and HIV risk
may also be mediated through the need to travel for work. In
our study, all women interviewed were settled in urban Beira.
However, the seasonal tending of crops in the countryside
and women's daily journeys in the search for work and food
were constraints consistently perceived as barriers to clinic
visits. Similarly, in Malawi, mobility was a marker of
increased risk and vulnerability for HIV-infected women
(Bryceson & Fonseca, 2006).
Our study found that the poor quality of services provided
by clinic staff affected women's follow-up with care and that
the ineffectual behaviors of health care workers may be rooted
in their perceived poor living conditions. Structural adjustment
policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
have cut national budgets since the 1980s, which has kept
health worker salaries at poverty levels, contributing to low
morale and pressing health workers to search for more lucra-
tive work in the private or informal sector (Gloyd etal., 2007).
Others agree that resource scarcity must be addressed,
structural adjustment policies must be reversed, and overall
expansion of public spending are required (Gloyd etal., 2007)
to improve the working and living conditions and thus morale
and behaviors of staff at health facilities. The implementa-
tion and success of culturally tailored health programs in
Mozambique (Loforte, 2007) suggest that health services are
weakened by health provider's misunderstanding of their
female clients. Anthropological research might facilitate
educational strategies to remediate the attitudes and behav-
iors of health workers (Loforte, 2003, 2007) and lead to
improved service utilization.
This study has several limitations. The nesting of our
study within a prospective research cohort may limit the gen-
eralizability of our findings. The small sample size and pur-
poseful sampling methodology may also limit our ability to
generalize to the HIV population in Mozambique.
Nonetheless, the voices and life circumstances of those who
participated in our study were consistent with the findings of
other studies, and provide valuable insights that allow us to
better understand reasons for poor follow-up that may apply
to women and children in similar contexts (Chapman, 2003,
2006; Farmer, Leandre, et
al., 2001; Jones et
al., 2005;
Painter etal., 2004; Painter etal., 2005).
In conclusion, our study's findings suggest that the
mere provision of clinical HIV care services will not nec-
essarily engage HIV/AIDS-affected women and children
into medical care. Our observed LTFU of more than 50%
of infants (Blankenship etal., 2000) appeared to be asso-
ciated with mothers' daily struggles related to poverty and
food insecurity, which prevented their use of available
services. Our study suggests that integration of mother
and child medical consultations, and more efficient and
culturally sensitive medical services may improve follow-
up. And finally, our study indicates that economic empow-
erment of women is crucial to achieving better compliance
with medical care.
