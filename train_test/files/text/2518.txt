Markey, E. (2015). The Impact of Caregiving on the Development of Major
Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Journal of European
Psychology Students, 6(1), 17-24, DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/jeps.cn
The growth of the older adult population, increased preva-
lence of chronic diseases, higher rates of survival among
people with disabilities, and high costs of institutional
care have forced millions of individuals into stressful roles
of providing care for ill or disabled family members (Talley
& Crews, 2007). Caring for an ill family member consumes
a huge amount of energy, time, and money over poten-
tially long periods of time. Due to the consuming nature of
the caring task, caregiving can be psychologically stressful
and exhausting, (Pruchno, Kleban, Michaels, & Dempsey,
1990). A survey conducted by Cheffings (2003) of over
1000 caregivers indicated that nearly half of the respond-
ents reported that their health was negatively affected by
their caregiving role. Comparable results were found in
a survey by Carers UK (2002) where the most common
negative emotions reported by caregivers were feelings of
being mentally, emotionally, and physically drained.
Research has demonstrated that racial and ethnic differ-
ences exist within the level of psychological distress expe-
rienced by caregivers. For example, Hilgeman et al. (2009)
found that a sample of Caucasian caregivers reported
more psychological stress when compared to African
American caregivers. A number of socio-demographic fac-
tors including age, gender, socioeconomic status and the
type and quality of the caregiver relationship have been
identified as contributing to caregivers stress. The effect of
all of the socio-demographic variables mentioned above
on the caregiver's quality of life is unclear as findings from
previous studies have been mixed (Wilder, Oliver, Demiris,
& Washington, 2008). A study conducted by Carter, Lewin,
Rashid, Adams, and Clover (2008) indicated that enhanced
quality of life for caregivers was correlated with caregivers
who were married to the care recipient, male, older, and
had achieved a minimum of a high school education. The
age of the caregiver was found to have an impact on the
caregiver's stress where younger caregivers are more likely
to experience caregiver stress. Pinquart and Sorenson's
(2007) study found that there was a higher rate of depres-
sion in older caregivers but a higher prevalence of anxi-
ety in younger caregivers. This was believed to be due
to fewer external coping resources such as money and
time for older caregivers but more competing roles such
as jobs and other caregiving responsibilities for younger
caregivers.
Differences in the stressors associated with caregiving
have been identified for caring for a person with a psy-
chological illness and caring for a person with a physical
illness. Research conducted by Teri et al. (1992) demon-
strated that the care of an older relative with both demen-
tia and depression was associated with higher levels of
burden compared to caregivers of a relative with a physi-
cal illness such as heart disease. A survey conducted by
the National Association for Caregiving and the American
Association of Retired Persons (AARP, 2004) with a large
sample of over 1500 caregiving families found that when
compared with caregivers of physically disabled older
adults, caregivers of relatives with dementia provided
more assistance and reported that providing care was
more stressful, impacted more on time spent with their
other family members, and had a higher rate of work
related difficulties.

Providing care for a relative is associated with psychological distress and a higher prevalence of
psychological disorders. This study investigated the prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders
among the caregiving population. The study was based on data drawn from the Collaborative Psychiatric
Epidemiology Surveys (CPES). Binary logistic regressions were conducted to examine these associations
and to identify factors influencing the development of depressive and anxiety disorders. The analysis
indicated that respondents providing care for a relative were at a higher risk of developing a psychological
disorder. A number of socio-demographic variables were identified as increasing the risk of developing a
psychological disorder such as being younger, female and divorced. The findings highlight the importance
of support and interventions for family caregivers.

People caring for a relative with a mental or physical ill-
ness face both similarities and unique characteristics in
relation to the task of caregiving, influencing the experi-
enced level of burden. For example, due to the nature of a
mental illness, caregivers may experience periods of well-
ness followed by periods of illness at a more frequent level
than people with a physical illness (Seltzer, Greenberg,
Floyd, & Hong, 2004). Furthermore, caregivers to peo-
ple with a mental illness also have to deal with a stigma
that may be associated with a mental illness. The cyclical
nature of a mental illness coupled with the stigma experi-
enced by caregivers could result in caregivers of mentally
ill people experiencing a higher level of caregiver stress
(Seltzer et al., 2004).
Most previous research has been based on a small sam-
ple size of caregivers who are providing care for people
with specific illnesses such as dementia or heart disease.
These studies due to their sample sizes cannot be general-
ised to the population. Our study is one of a few epidemi-
ological studies conducted within the area of caregiving.
Past research has focused primarily on the impact of car-
egiving on the caregivers' levels of depression. Few studies
have examined the effect of caregiving on the caregivers'
levels of anxiety. Therefore, this study has extended the
scope of previous research by looking at these aspects.
In order to overcome the deficits of previous research,
the primary aim of this study is to investigate the preva-
lence of both depression and anxiety disorders, among
individuals caring for a relative with either a physical or
a psychological illness. A secondary aim of this study is to
investigate the impact of several mediating variables such
as demographic and socio-economic status on the devel-
opment of caregivers' psychological disorders. In order to
achieve the aims, this study has three main hypotheses:
(1) there will be a higher prevalence of depressive and
anxiety disorders among people providing care for an ill
relative; (2) there will be a higher prevalence of depressive
and anxiety disorders among people providing care for a
relative with a psychological rather than a physical illness;
and (3) work status, marital status, education, age, and
gender of the caregiver will significantly affect the likeli-
hood of developing a depressive or anxiety disorder.
Method
Procedure
Forthepurposeofthisstudy,thepublicversionoftheCPES
was downloaded (Alegria, Jackson, Kessler, & Takeuchi,
2008). We examined the original data for the relevant
variables for the prevalence of depressive and anxiety
disorders within the past 12 months as well as socioeco-
nomic and demographic status. The data chosen from the
original National Institute of Mental Health Collaborative
Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (NIMH-CPES) data set
were then extracted and recoded to allow conclusions to
be drawn on the hypotheses raised in this paper. Ethical
approval for the current study, using secondary data anal-
ysis, was obtained from the Psychology (Magee) Research
Governance Filter Committee at the University of Ulster.
Sample
The NIMH-CPES sample was based on a multistage clus-
tered area probability sample of the US population. The
sample consisted of 20,013 American citizens. The mean
age of the sample was 43.38. The sample was representa-
tive of the US population and also racially and ethnically
diverse. Therefore, the results of these findings include
different racial and ethnic backgrounds which most pre-
vious research has failed to consider. Further informa-
tion on the sample designs can be found in Heeringa et
al. (2004). Please refer to Table 1 for the main features
of the sample designs of the Collaborative Psychiatric
Epidemiology Studies.
Measures
The CPES surveys were developed under the sponsorship
of the NIMH (Alegria et al,. 2008). The primary objective
of CPES was to collect data on the prevalence of men-
tal disorders, impairments associated with these disor-
ders, and their treatment patterns. The CPES combines
three nationally representative surveys: the National
Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS ­R), the National
Survey of American Life (NSAL), and the National Latino
and Asian American Study (NLAAS).
The core NIMH-CPES questionnaire was based on the
World Health Organization's (WHO) expanded version of

the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)
developed for the World Mental Health Survey Initiative,
the WMH-CIDI (Kessler & Ustun, 2004). WMH-CIDI is
a fully structured lay-administered diagnostic inter-
view that generates diagnoses according to definitions
and criteria of both the International Classification of
Diseases -10 (ICD-10; WHO, 1996) and the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR; APA,
2000) diagnostic systems. The WMH-CIDI interviews were
administered using computer-assisted interviewing. CIDI
validity studies indicate that there is a significant associa-
tion between diagnoses based on data collected by the
CIDI and diagnoses made by clinicians who re-interview a
sample of respondents (Kessler & Ustun, 2004). For addi-
tional information, refer to Kessler and Ustun (2004).
Disorders
The psychological disorders measured in this study are
major depressive disorder (MDE) and generalized anxiety
disorder (GAD) as defined by the DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000).
In the National Comorbidity Survey, 58% of patients
diagnosed with major depression were found to have an
anxiety disorder; among these patients, the rate of co-
morbidity with Generalized Anxiety Disorder was 17.2%
(Kessler & Uston, 2004). Based on these high co-morbidity
rates, the results yielded may have been influenced by
the two independent variables in this study being highly
correlated.
Demographic Variables
The following socio-demographic variables were used in
the study, sex, age (mean = 43.38), marital status, work
status, and education. The variable marital status included
three categories, married, divorced, separated or widowed
and never married. The variable work status also included
three categories, employed, not in the labour force, and
unemployed. Education included four categories which
are education greater than or equal to 16 years, educa-
tion 0 to 11 years, education 12 years, and education 13
to 15 years.
Type of Caregiver
The variable caring for a relative with a physical illness
included the following physical illnesses: heart problem,
memory problem, mental retardation, physical disabil-
ity, and chronic physical illness. The variable caring for a
relative with a psychological illness included the follow-
ing psychological illnesses: drug/alcohol problem, health
problem depression, health problem anxiety, health prob-
lem manic depressive, and health problem other serious
chronic mental health problem.
Analytical Strategy
Cross tabulation analyses were computed to examine the
association between caregiving and depression and anxi-
ety disorders. Binary logistic regressions were conducted
to assess the impact of a number of factors on the devel-
opment of depressive and anxiety disorder. The models
contained the following predictor variables sex, age, work
status, marital status, years of education, and type of rela-
tive's illness.
Results
Out of the total sample (N = 20,013), 9.7% of respond-
ents suffered from a depressive and/or an anxiety dis-
order with 6.5% (n = 1,293) suffering from a depressive
disorder and 3.2% (n = 646) suffering from an anxiety
disorder. Out of the total sample (N = 20,013), 11.2% (n =
2,239) of respondents provided care for a relative. In the
caregiver sample of (n = 2,239), 58 % (n = 1,310) provided
care for a relative with a physical problem while 41% (n
= 929) provided care for a relative with a psychological
problem. The most common physical illness reported was
heart problems. Out of the sample of respondents caring
for a relative with a physical problem(n = 1,310), 42% (n
= 557) of respondents provided care for a relative with a
heart problem. The most common psychological illness
reported was depression. Out of the sample of respond-
ents caring for a relative with a psychological problem (n
= 929), 62% (n = 582) cared for a relative with depression.
Please refer to Table 2 for an illustration of the frequency
and percentages of the socio-demographic variables
included in the study.
A two-way cross tabulation analysis was conducted to
examine the association between caring for a relative
with a psychological disorder and suffering from a depres-
sive or an anxiety disorder. The chi square test for inde-
pendence indicated a significant association between

depression disorder and providing care for a relative with
a psychological illness, 2 (1, n = 3092) = 90.35, p = < .05,
 = .17. A significant association was also found between
providing care for a relative with a psychological illness
and suffering from an anxiety disorder, c2 (1, n = 3,092) =
28.794 p = < .05,  = .09.
Following the significant association found between
caring for a relative with a psychological disorder and suf-
fering from a depressive or anxiety disorder, the analysis
investigated the association between caring for a rela-
tive with a physical illness and suffering from an anxiety
or depressive disorder using a two-way cross tabulation
analysis. In contrast to caring for a relative with a psy-
chological disorder, the chi square test for independence
showed that there was no significant association between
depression disorder and providing care for a relative with
a physical illness, 2 (1, n = 3,137) = 1.364, p = > .05,  =
.022. Similar to depression, a non-significant association
was found between caring for a relative with a physical
illness and suffering from an anxiety disorder, 2 (1, n =
3,137) = .12, p = > .05,  = .008. In summary, respondents
caring for a relative with a psychological disorder had a
higher frequency of both depression and anxiety disor-
ders when compared to non-caregivers, whereas respond-
ents caring for a relative with a physical illness did not
have a statistically higher frequency of depression and
anxiety disorders.
Binary Logistic Regression
A binary logistic regression was performed to investigate
the impact of a number of factors on the likelihood of suf-
fering from a depressive disorder. In relation to a depres-
sive disorder, the model containing all variables was
statistically significant (x2 `13, n = 1,648 = 94.681, p < .05).
Six out of the seven variables made a statistically signifi-
cant contribution to the model: sex, age, employment sta-
tus, marital status, and type of relative's illness. Please see
Table 3 for the Binary Logistic Regression model predict-
ing the likelihood of suffering from a depressive disorder.
In relation to an anxiety disorder, the model contain-
ing all six variables was statistically significant (x2 `13, n
= 1,648' = 42.848, p < .05). In contrast to the model for
depression disorder where six out of the seven variables
made a significant contribution, three out of the seven
variables made a statistically significant contribution to
the anxiety model. The following variables made a sig-
nificant contribution to the model: marital status, type
of illness, and intensity of illness. Please see Table 4 for
the Binary Logistic Regression model predicting the likeli-
hood of suffering from an anxiety disorder.
Discussion
The primary aim of this study was to investigate the impact
that providing care for a relative has on the occurrence of
a Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder
as defined by the DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000). Specifically, this
study aimed to decipher whether significant differences
in the prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders
existed among caregivers who provide care for a relative
with a physical illness and those who provide care for a
relative with a psychological illness. A secondary aim of
this study was to identify the predictive value of a num-
ber of factors that would impact the likelihood of a per-
son suffering from a Depressive Disorder or a Generalized
Anxiety Disorder. The study provides comprehensive find-
ings on the impact that caregiving has on psychological

well-being. Moreover, a number of risk factors were identi-
fied as significantly increasing the likelihood of suffering
from a depressive or anxiety disorder.
Similar to Cheffings' (2003) research, which indicated
that caregivers were negatively impacted by their caregiv-
ing role, the cross tabulation analysis indicated that car-
egivers had a higher rate of depression when compared
to non-caregivers. The higher prevalence of depressive
disorders reported by caregivers is similar to previous
research findings. Schulz et al. (1995), following a meta-
analysis, concluded that in almost every study, caregiv-
ers reported an elevated level of depressive symptoms
compared to comparison groups. One possible reason
for this and similar research findings is that the chronic
stressors of caregiving can lead to psychological distress
and the development of psychological disorders such as
depression. Genetic predisposition should also be taken
into consideration as an alternative explanation for the
higher rate of psychological disorders among caregivers.
In essence, respondents caring for a relative with a psy-
chological disorder may be more likely to suffer from a
psychological disorder due to their genetic vulnerability
to developing a psychological disorder rather than the
specific stressors associated with caregiving.
Contrary to the first hypothesis which stipulated that
caregivers would have a higher prevalence of anxiety
disorders, the analysis indicated that the prevalence of
anxiety disorders among caregivers was not statistically
significantly different from non­caregivers. The findings
indicated that a statistical significant difference did not
exist between the group of people providing care for a
relative with a psychological illness and the group provid-
ing care for a relative with a physical illness.
One reason for the non-significant differences found in
anxiety disorders and the substantially lower prevalence
rates of depression disorders as compared to other studies
lies in the stringent psychiatric measurement used in this
study. Some caregivers may suffer from elevated levels of
psychological distress but may not meet the threshold for
the DSM­IV criteria (APA, 2000). Consequently, a number
of caregivers may report higher levels of anxiety or depres-
sive symptoms but may have been excluded from the
analysis. As Vitaliano, Young, and Zhang (2006) suggest
utilising less stringent psychiatric criteria such as dysthy-
mia disorder may give a more accurate measure of psycho-
logical disorders amongst the caregiving population.
Based on the binary logistic regressions, one can con-
clude that the likelihood of suffering from a depressive
or anxiety disorder is significantly increased mainly by
providing care for a relative with a psychological illness.
Caring for a relative with a psychological illness more than
tripled the likelihood of suffering from a depressive dis-
order. The odds ratio is lower for anxiety when compared
to depression disorder; however it is still a substantial
increase of 3.5 increments. These findings complement
previous research findings. For example, Greenberg,
Seltzer, and Greenley's (1993) findings suggested that
mothers caring for an adult child with a mental illness
suffer higher levels of psychological distress and caregiver
burden when compared to mothers of adult children with
mental retardation.
These findings support our third hypothesis which
states that people providing care for a relative with a psy-
chological illness will suffer higher rates of depressive and
anxiety disorders. One possible reason for these increased
rates is the precarious nature of a psychological illness. As

Hooker, Manoogian-O'Dell, Monahan, Frazier, and Shifren
(2000) postulated, the course of a mental illness is very
cyclical and volatile which leaves the family cargiver with
a lower sense of mastery over the relatives' behaviour
and symptoms. Other contributing factors that may have
contributed to these findings are the disruption within
the family and social relationships as well as the stigma
accompanying a mental illness.
The level of psychological stress experienced by caregiv-
ers could be dependent on the type of psychological ill-
ness that their relative is experiencing. In order to conduct
this analysis, a number of psychological disorders were
combined including drug problems and schizophrenia
to create the variable caring for a relative with a psycho-
logical illness. The variation in distress caused by specific
disorders may have confounded the results causing psy-
chological illness to be a significant predictor of anxiety
and depression disorder. Future research should explore
the impact of specific psychological illnesses on the devel-
opment of a depressive and anxiety disorder.
The family burden measure of care recipient's type of
illness is based on the assumption that each caregiver
provides care for a relative with either a psychological or
physical illness. For the purposes of the analysis, these
variables were assumed to be mutually exclusive, whereas
in reality, a care recipient could suffer from both a physi-
cal and psychological illness. In this study, approximately
55% of caregivers provided care for a relative with both
a psychological and physical illness. Not considering the
high correlation between these two variables may have
elevated the significant impact that caring for a relative
with a psychological illness had on the caregivers' risk of
developing a depressive or anxiety disorder. It is interest-
ing to note that although there was a high correlation
between anxiety and depression disorders, different pat-
terns were found for each of these disorders. Further anal-
ysis should be conducted specifically analysing the group
of caregivers providing care to a relative with both a physi-
cal and psychological illness.
An alternative explanation for the significant results
found in the Binary Logistic Regression may be the influ-
ence of genetics and the environment rather than the car-
egiving task itself. If a relative suffers from a psychological
disorder, the caregiver may be more vulnerable to develop-
ing a psychological disorder due to their genetic makeup.
The environment can have an impact on the development
of a psychological disorder, rendering a person more vul-
nerable to developing a psychological disorder. The car-
egiver and relative could have shared the environment
which would have influenced the likelihood of suffering
from an anxiety or depressive disorder.
A number of socio-demographic factors were found to
be highly influential to the development of a depressive
disorder or anxiety disorder. Carter et al. (2008) reported
that caregivers who were married to the care recipient,
male, older, and had at least a high school education
reported better quality of life and lower psychological dis-
tress. Similar to Carter et al. (2008), this study indicated
that being older, married, a man, employed irrespective
of caregiving task decreased the likelihood of suffering
from a depressive disorder. In accordance with previous
research, females had an increased risk of suffering from
a depressive disorder in comparison to men (Greenberg et
al., 1993; Hooker et al., 2000; Schulz et al., 2009). Previous
research has shown that women are nearly twice as likely
to suffer from depression as men (Schulz et al., 2009). The
reason for these gender differences may have to do with
higher competing roles of women in today's society. For
example, women are more likely to have to contend with
balancing work and looking after children which could
increase stress levels and make them more vulnerable to
developing depression (Pruchno et al., 1990; Schulz et al.,
2009). Women may be more likely to report symptoms
of depression where men due to stigma may underre-
port symptoms or not recognise symptoms of depression
(Hooker et al., 2000). Therefore, the gender differences
found in this study could be influenced by increased
stressors and the reporting of symptoms.
In this study, the impact of age on the occurrence of
an anxiety or depressive disorder was in contrast to pre-
vious research. Pinquart and Sorenson (2007) found that
older people had a higher rate of depression and younger
people had higher rates of anxiety. Our study found that
that being younger significantly increased the likelihood
of suffering from a depressive disorder whereas age was
not a significant predictor of suffering from an anxiety dis-
order. One could surmise that younger people have more
pressure and other roles to fulfil rendering them more
vulnerable to suffering from an anxiety disorder (Pinquart
& Sorenson 2007).
Similar to previous findings of Dew et al. (2004), in this
study employment status significantly affected the likeli-
hood of suffering from a depressive disorder. Not being in
the labour force increased the likelihood of suffering from
a depressive disorder twofold. Dew et al.'s (2004) study
indicated that depressive and anxiety related disorders
were elevated by unemployment (Dew et al., 2004). Our
study did not find that unemployment predicted elevated
rates of depressive or anxiety disorders. The sole socio-
demographic variable that held significant predictive
value for both anxiety and depressive disorders was mari-
tal status, more specifically, being divorced, separated, or
widowed. People who are divorced, separated, or widowed
may be experiencing chronic stressors relating to their
marital situation. As a result of the overload of pressures,
they may be more vulnerable to developing a psychologi-
cal disorder (Haley, Lamond, Han, Burton, & Schonwetter,
2003). This premise provides an explanation for the non-
significant effect of never being married on the occur-
rence of depressive and anxiety disorders. Alternatively,
the high predictive value of this factor may be due to the
additional support that married people obtain from their
spouses (Haley et al., 2003).
Conclusion
Family members providing care to an ill relative are per-
forming a great service not only to their family but also to
society as a whole. From an economic perspective, family
caregivers save health services billions in hospital costs.
The current study provides evidence that people providing

care do so at a great risk to their own psychological health.
Utilising previous research findings and the current find-
ings, it is of the utmost importance that health services
implement caregiver interventions that are designed to
help specific groups of caregivers that are at greater risk
of developing a psychological disorder.
