Objectives. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between religious meaning and subjective well-
being. A major emphasis is placed on assessing race differences in the relationship between these constructs.
Methods. Interviews were conducted with a nationwide sample of older White and older Black adults. Survey items
were administered to assess a sense of meaning in life that is derived specifically from religion. Subjective well-being was
measured with indices of life satisfaction, self-esteem, and optimism.
Results. The findings suggest that older adults who derive a sense of meaning in life from religion tend to have higher
levels of life satisfaction, self-esteem, and optimism. The data further reveal that older Black adults are more likely to find
meaning in religion than older White adults. In addition, the relationships among religious meaning, life satisfaction, self-
esteem, and optimism tend to be stronger for older African Americans persons than older White persons.
Discussion. Researchers have argued for some time that religion may be an important source of resilience for older
Black adults, but it is not clear how these beneficial effects arise. The data from this study suggest that religious meaning
may be an important factor.
Arapidly growing literature suggests that greater involve-
ment in religion is associated with better physical health,
better mental health, and enhanced feelings of subjective well-
being across the life course (Ellison, 1994; Koenig, McCul-
lough, & Larson, 2001; McFadden, 1995). With respect to
well-being, the potentially beneficial effects of religion have
been observed with a wide range of outcomes, including life
satisfaction (Ellison, 1993), happiness (Poloma & Pendleton,
1990), self-esteem (Krause, 1995), and optimism (Idler & Kasl,
1997). Although this research has provided many valuable
insights, it is less evident how the potentially beneficial effects
of religion on subjective well-being arise. Part of the difficulty
may be traced to the fact that religion is a complex
multidimensional phenomenon that may affect well-being in
a number of different ways (Ellison & Levin, 1998). For ex-
ample, research indicates that religious coping (Pargament,
1997), prayer (Poloma & Gallup, 1991), and church-based
social support (Krause, Ellison, & Wulff, 1998) may all play
a role in this process.
To understand more fully the relationship between religion
and well-being, it is important to expand the scope of inquiry
by turning to dimensions of religion that have been overlooked
by other investigators. The purpose of the present study is to
examine one such facet of religion--religious meaning. A
thorough review of the literature failed to uncover a satisfactory
definition of religious meaning. Therefore, for the purposes of
this study, religious meaning is defined as the process of
turning to religion in an effort to find a sense of purpose in life,
a sense of direction in life, and a sense that there is a reason for
one's existence. Although there has been little prior empirical
work with religious meaning, there is good reason to suspect it
may be associated with subjective well-being. Frankl (1963)
argued that the desire to find a sense of meaning is the primary
motivational force in life. Moreover, a number of investigators
believe that one of the basic functions of religion is to help
people fulfill this fundamental need. Evidence of this may be
found, for example, in the classic work of Clark (1958), who
argued that, ``... religion more than any other human function
satisfies the need for meaning in life'' (p. 419). Similarly, in the
process of developing his thought-provoking discussion of
significance, Pargament (1997) observed that, ``In essence,
religion offers meaning in life'' (p. 49).
Satisfying basic needs in life should be associated with
enhanced feelings of subjective well-being (Maslow, 1971). If
finding meaning in life is a basic goal of human existence, and
religion helps people find meaning, it follows that religious
meaning should be associated with greater subjective well-
being.
The first goal of the present study is to see whether religious
meaning is related to subjective well-being in late life. But
rather than focus on this relationship alone, this study aims to
contribute to the literature by bringing the potentially
important influence of race to the foreground. This line of
inquiry is justified because an extensive literature suggests that
older African American persons are substantially more
involved in religion than older White persons (Levin, Taylor,
& Chatters, 1994). To the extent this is true, race differences
may arise at two key junctures in this study. First, older Black
adults may be more likely than older White adults to derive
a sense of meaning in life from religion. Second, the impact of
religious meaning on subjective well-being may be stronger
for older Black than older White adults. There do not appear to
be any studies in the literature that evaluate the interface
between religious meaning, race, and subjective well-being in
late life.
The discussion that follows is divided into three main
sections. First, the theoretical underpinnings of the study are
developed in greater detail. Second, the study sample and

measures are presented. The data analytic strategy is briefly
presented at this juncture as well. Finally, results from
a nationwide survey of older Black and older White adults
are reviewed and discussed.
Religious Meaning and Subjective
Well-Being in Late Life
The theoretical rationale for this study is developed below in
four components. First, an effort is made to clarify the nature of
religious meaning by showing how it differs from a construct
that has been examined more often in the literature--a general
sense of meaning in life. Second, a rationale is provided for
why religious meaning may be related to subjective well-being.
Third, a case is made for why it is important to study religious
meaning and well-being in samples composed of older people.
Finally, the reasons why there may be race differences in
religious meaning and subjective well-being are examined in
greater detail.
Religious meaning and a general sense of meaning in life. --
Most research in the field focuses on a general sense of
meaning in life (Reker, 1997). This construct is differentiated
from religious meaning by its scope or focus. As Reker (2000)
points out, a general sense of meaning in life can arise from any
number of sources, including personal relationships, work,
hobbies, and religion. In contrast, religious meaning obviously
arises from one source alone. To date, most studies on religious
issues rely on a general sense of meaning in life. For example,
Petersen and Roy (1985) found that religious salience (i.e., the
importance of religion) is associated with a greater sense of
general meaning in life. However, they did not empirically
evaluate meaning that arises specifically from religion, nor did
they assess whether religious meaning is associated with
subjective well-being. A major contribution of the present study
arises from the fact that an effort is made to address these gaps
in the literature.
Research that focuses specifically on religious meaning is
important for the following reason. The wider intent of this
study is to find out why religion may be associated with
subjective well-being in late life. If meaning plays a role in this
respect, then it makes more sense to focus on meaning as it
arises specifically from religion. If a general sense of meaning
was used instead, it would be more difficult to know if the
effects were from religion, work, interpersonal relationships, or
some other secular influence.
Religious meaning and subjective well-being. --Berger's
(1990) widely cited work on religion helps show why religious
meaning may influence feelings of subjective well-being.
Berger maintained that people are inevitably confronted with
a series of painful and discrepant situations in life that often are
not amenable to change. Included among these difficulties are
the presence of evil and suffering in the world, as well as the
unavoidable prospect of death. He argued that religion helps
people deal with these challenges by providing theodicies.
Theodicies are religiously based world views that explain
things like death, and show how they fit into a larger cosmic
order or purpose. Berger (1990) asserted that people who
subscribe to and internalize these theodicies derive a deeper
sense of meaning and purpose in life. In contrast, he argued that
people who are unable to accept religious theodicies are more
likely to experience a state of anomy, which is a painful
separation from the wider social order that casts the individual
into a deep sense of inner turmoil.
It is surprising to find that there are relatively few empirical
studies that assess Berger's (1990) notion of theodicies. One
noteworthy exception is the work of Musick (2000). However,
his operational definition of theodicies was fairly narrow because
it focused only on the degree to which individuals feel the world,
and the people in it, are evil or sinful (i.e., sin theodicies).
His findings reveal that people who subscribe to sin theodicies
tend to have lower levels of life satisfaction than individuals
who hold more positive views about the nature of the world.
However, it is important to point out that these findings held for
White study participants, but not Black study participants.
Although the work of Musick (2000) provides valuable
insight into the potentially important role of religious
theodicies, more research is needed. More specifically, the
interface between religious theodicies and well-being needs
to be evaluated with measures that encompass more than
just beliefs about sin and evil. Consistent with the original
formulation developed by Berger (1990), measures are needed
that assess beliefs about the wider meaning and purpose in life.
These broader measures of religious meaning form the focal
point of the analyses presented herein.
Subjective well-being is assessed in this study with three
measures: life satisfaction, self-esteem, and optimism. Conse-
quently, it is important to show why religious meaning might
be related to each of these outcomes. There are good reasons
to suspect that religious meaning may be related to life
satisfaction. One of the key functions of religious meaning is to
provide a better understanding of adversity and the challenges
that arise in life. But more than this, religious meaning helps
a person see the larger reasons for difficult situations that lie
beyond their own immediate concerns, expectations, and
aspirations. Attaining these insights, and believing their lives
fit into a larger plan or purpose, may be a source of significant
personal growth for some individuals. Realizing that one has
grown in the face of adversity may, in turn, be an important
source of life satisfaction.
There are relatively straightforward reasons why religious
meaning may be associated with self-esteem. If older people
believe that God has a purpose and a plan for their life, then it
must mean that God loves and cares for them. Because feelings
of self-esteem arise, in part, from views of the self that are held
by significant others, believing that God values, loves, and
cares for them should bolster the self-esteem of older people.
Finally, it seems reasonable to assume that if people believe
religion provides a sense of direction and purpose in life, they
will feel more optimistic about the future. In fact, this is one
reason why Peterson (2000) argued that, ``Religion lends itself
particularly well to big optimism because of its certainty''
(p. 51). Similarly, Seligman (1990) maintained that religious
meaning enhances feelings of optimism by helping people see
that their lives will follow a specific and beneficial plan that has
been devised by God (see Seligman, 1990, p. 203).
Religious meaning and aging. --There are two reasons why it
is important to study the relationship between religious meaning
and well-being in samples comprising older people. First, as
RELIGIOUS MEANING S161
discussed previously, Berger (1990) maintained that religious
theodicies help people deal with painful life circumstances that
are not changed easily. Older people are often confronted by this
type of difficulty. More specifically, as Nuland's (1993) book on
the physiology of aging reveals, physical decline is an unavoid-
able part of growing older. Although it is true that the timing and
rate of decline may vary from person to person, the fact that
decline will eventually occur is certain. In addition, there is some
evidence that cognitive abilities tend to diminish as a number of
people go through late life. More specifically, research indicates
that approximately 29% of people aged 75 and older have
either mild or severe cognitive impairment (George, Landerman,
Blazer, & Anthony, 1991). Clearly, when coupled with the close
proximity of death, finding a larger meaning and purpose in life
throughreligion may helpolder people deal more effectively with
these intractable physical and mental health changes.
There is also some evidence that the physical and mental
health changes associated with aging may be accompanied by
certain psychological challenges, as well. This is evident in the
work of developmental theorists, such as Erikson (1959). He
maintained that, as people approach late life, they enter the final
stage of development that is characterized by the crisis of
integrity versus despair. This is a time of deep introspection,
when older people survey their lives, attempt to reconcile the
things they have done, and make sense of the experiences they
have had (see also Buhler, 1962; Butler & Lewis, 1982; Jung,
1953). Viewed broadly, a common theme cuts across the work
on adult development. In particular, this literature suggests that,
as people get older, they carefully re-evaluate the past in
an effort to weave their lives into a more coherent whole.
Ultimately, the goal of this process is to imbue life with a deeper
sense of meaning. It is especially important to point out that
everyone does not resolve these developmental challenges
successfully, and as a Erikson (1959) argued, they may sub-
sequently slip into despair.
Tornstam (1997) provides further evidence of how key
developmental challenges may shape a sense of meaning
and well-being in late life. More specifically, his theory of
gerotranscendence specifies that, as people grow older, they
experience a major shift, ``... from a materialistic and
pragmatic view of the world to a more cosmic and transcendent
one, normally accompanied by an increase in life satisfaction''
(Tornstam, 1997, p. 143). It is especially important to point out
that this cosmic perspective involves adopting a wider view of
the nature and purpose of life.
Although people of all ages engage in a search for meaning
in life, there may be age differences in the function or goal of
this process. This may be seen by turning to the work of
Staudinger (2001) on life reviews and reminiscence. She argued
that younger people reflect on the broad issues in their lives to
find solutions to a pressing life decision. In contrast, older
people engage in life reviews in an effort to strike a balance in
life and to integrate their lives more tightly as they have been
lived. Even though reminiscence may help people of all ages, it
appears to have a more immediate or pragmatic focus among
the young that does not typically involve wider insights that are
gleaned from reflecting deeply on the past. In contrast, by using
life reviews to integrate a broad array of past experiences, older
adults may be in a better position to see wider themes and
purposes in life.
In addition to reviewing the work of developmental the-
orists, there is a second way to show why it is important to
study religious meaning and well-being in late life. Some
investigators maintain that people tend to become more
religious as they grow older. For example, using data that
had been gathered from the same respondents over a 40-year
period, Wink and Dillon (2001) reported that the importance of
religion decreased through early and middle adulthood, but
then increased significantly during the later years of life. Based
on a comparable measure of the importance of religion, Argue
and her colleagues also found a pattern of nonlinear change
with age, but the results were more complex (Argue, Johnson,
& White, 1999). More specifically, these investigators found
that the age effect of religion was stronger for Catholics than
Protestants. Ploch and Hastings (1994) reported that church
attendance increases sharply up to about age 70. Like Argue
and colleagues (1999), Ploch and Hastings (1994) found that
church attendance increases with age, but the relationship
between these measures varies by religious preference (see,
also, Firebaugh & Harley, 1991).
It is important to note that not all researchers would agree
that religiousness increases with age. For example, Davie and
Vincent (1998) review evidence suggesting that researchers
may merely be observing cohort and not age effects. Neverthe-
less, when taken as a whole, there is some evidence in the
literature that religiousness increases with age. If this is true,
and a central function of religion is to provide a sense of
meaning in life, then perhaps religious meaning may become
increasingly important as people grow older.
Race differences in religious meaning and well-being. --The
theoretical rationale provided up to this point suggests that
religious meaning may promote a sense of psychological well-
being among older people. But, consistent with the specific
aims for this study, it is important to think about how race
differences may arise in this relationship.
A considerable number of studies suggest that older Black
adults are more deeply involved in religion than older White
adults. In one of the more comprehensive studies, Levin and
colleagues (1994) explored race differences in religion across
four national surveys. Race comparisons were made on 21
indicators of religion that were contained in these different data
bases. The findings indicated that older Black adults were more
religious than older White adults in 19 of the 21 tests. This
study revealed, for example, that compared with older White
adults, older Black adults attend church more often, read
religious books more often, and feel that religion is more
important in their lives.
A key premise in the present study is that some fundamental
underlying factor must be at work for race differences to
emerge in such a wide range of religion measures. The purpose
of the discussion that follows is threefold: (1) to show that this
underlying factor is religious meaning; (2) to briefly trace the
historical origins of this influence; and (3) to consider how the
effects of religious meaning on well-being might be manifest
among older White and older Black adults.
In a thought-provoking volume, Cooper-Lewter and Mitchell
(1986) propose that, at the basis of Black culture, is a set of
core religious beliefs, or religious world views. Included among
the 10 core religious beliefs they identified are beliefs about the
KRAUSE
S162
nature of God and His relationship to man, as well as beliefs
about basic human nature and the way people should relate to
each other. They go on to point out that these core religious
beliefs, ``... are the bedrock attitudes that govern all deliberate
behavior and relationships and also all spontaneous responses
to crises'' (Cooper-Lewter & Mitchell, 1986, p. 3). Although
these researchers do not use the term ``religious meaning''
explicitly, it is hard to imagine how these core religious beliefs
could function without fostering a deep sense of religious
meaning.
Similar views are expressed by Ellison (1993). He argues
that one of the primary functions of the church in the Black
community is to provide individuals with a sense of their own
inherent uniqueness as individuals. Moreover, the church
promotes and rewards a range of spiritual qualities, including
wisdom and morality. These important functions are, in turn,
likely to promote a sense of meaning in life.
A key issue at this juncture is to determine why these core
religious beliefs and functions achieved such an elevated status
in the Black community. There are clear historical reasons why
this may be so. A number of investigators maintain that because
of centuries of discrimination and prejudice, the church became
the social center of the Black community (Du Bois, 1903/
2000). In addition to being the center of religious training and
worship, the church also became the nucleus of social activities
and a conduit for the dispersion of social services (Billingsley,
1999). As Lincoln and Mamiya (1990) point out, the church
assumed this pivotal position because it was the only institution
in the Black community that was wholly owned and controlled
by Black persons. But the wider historical forces that were at
work did more than just shape the organizational aspects of
the church. In addition, these historical influences shaped the
content of Black theology as well. More specifically, Paris
(1995) maintained that religion in the African American
community is guided by a ``survival theology.'' Arising from
centuries of slavery, discrimination, and prejudice, this survival
theology emphasizes, ``... the maintenance, preservation, and
enhancement of meaningful life ... in the midst of the actual
experience of suffering and the existential threat of death ...''
(p. 48). An insightful qualitative study by Black (1999) further
highlights the role played by meaning in Black theology. She
found Black women were able to find meaning in poverty and
racism because they, ``... interpreted it as a measure of their
strength, imbued it with divine purpose, and foresaw a just
end'' (Black, 1999, p. 372).
Although religious meaning may play a more central role in
the lives of older Black people, it is important to reflect
carefully on how the effects of religious meaning may be
manifest. A basic premise in the present study is that there are
two ways to think about this issue. First, older Black people
may be more likely than older White people to find a sense of
meaning in religion. This differential involvement perspective
may be evaluated by either looking at mean differences in
religious meaning for older White and older Black people or by
regressing religious meaning on race.
In contrast, a second view specifies that the relationship
between religious meaning and subjective well-being is
stronger for older Black than for older White persons. This
means that, even though older Black and older White people
may have the same religious meaning score, the relationship
between religious meaning and well-being is stronger for older
Blacks than older White people. This differential impact per-
spective suggests there may be something qualitatively different
about the nature of religious meaning in the Black community,
or that some unique facet of religious meaning is an espe-
cially important source of resilience for older Black people.
The survival theology discussed by Paris (1995) provides one
example of how religious meaning may be qualitatively
different in the Black community. Evidence of the differential
impact perspective would be found by testing for a statistical
interaction effect between religious meaning and race on
subjective well-being.
It is important to point out that the differential involvement
and the differential impact perspectives are not mutually
exclusive and that both may be operating at the same time. In
contrast, only one of the two viewpoints may accurately capture
the underlying process that is at work. Either way, comparing
and contrasting the two approaches should provide valuable
insight into the nature of the relationships among race, religious
meaning, and subjective well-being in late life. There do not
appear to be any studies in the literature that either discuss or
empirically evaluate these two perspectives. Doing so repre-
sents another major contribution of the work presented below.
METHODS
Sample
The data for this study come from a nationwide survey of
older Whites and older African American people. The study
population was defined as all household residents who were
either White or Black, noninstitutionalized, English-speaking,
and at least 66 years of age. Geographically, the study pop-
ulation was restricted to eligible persons residing in the co-
terminous United States (i.e., residents of Alaska and Hawaii
were excluded). Finally, the study was restricted to people who
were currently practicing Christians, individuals who were
Christians in the past but no longer practice any religion, and
people who were not affiliated with any faith at any point in
their lifetime. Individuals who practice a religion other than
Christianity (e.g., Jews and Muslims) were excluded, because it
would be difficult to devise a set of religion measures that are
suitable for persons of all faiths.
The sampling frame consisted of eligible persons contained
in the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) Medicare
Beneficiary Eligibility List (HCFA is now called the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services). This list contains the
name, address, sex, and race of virtually every person in the
United States. It should be emphasized that people are included
in this list even if they are not receiving Social Security
benefits. Nevertheless, some older people are not in the data
base because they do not have a Social Security number. This
may be because of factors such as illegal immigration.
A five-step procedure was used to draw the sample. First,
once each year, researchers at HCFA draw a 5% sample of
names from their master file. These names are selected with
a simple random sampling procedure. The sampled names
include individuals who are 65 years of age or older. However,
by the time the field period for the present study began, subjects
in the 5% file were at least 66 years of age. It is for this reason
RELIGIOUS MEANING S163
that the study population was defined earlier as including
people who were 66 years of age or older. In the second step
of the sampling procedure, the 5% file was split into two
subfiles--one containing older White and the other containing
older Black people. Each file was sorted by county and then by
zip code within each county. Then, in the third step, an nth
interval was calculated for each file based on the total number
of eligible records. Following a random start, 75 nth selections
were made in each file. In the fourth step of the sampling
strategy, primary sampling units (i.e., PSUs) were formed by
selecting approximately 25 names above and 25 names below
each case identified in step three. Finally, in the last step,
sampled persons within each PSU were recruited for an
interview with the goal of obtaining 10 cases per PSU.
Interviewing began in March 2001 and concluded in August
2001. The data collection was performed by Louis Harris and
Associates (now Harris Interactive). A total of 1,500 interviews
were completed. Older Black participants were oversampled so
that sufficient statistical power would be available to explore
fully race differences in religion. More specifically, the sample
consisted of 748 older White and 752 older Black adults. The
overall response rate for the study was 62%.
After using listwise deletion of missing values to deal with
item nonresponse, the number of cases used in the analyses
presented herein ranged from 1,112 to 1,247. Based on the
group consisting of 1,247 individuals, preliminary analysis
revealed that 50% of the subjects were older White and 50%
were older Black people. The average age of these people was
74.4 years (SD 5 6.37 years). Approximately 41% were older
men, and 50% were married at the time of the interview.
Finally, these older adults reported they had successfully
completed an average of 11.5 years of schooling (SD 5 3.38
years). These descriptive data, as well as the findings presented
herein, are based on weighted data.
Measures
Table 1 contains the survey items that are used in this study.
Table 2 provides the means and standard deviations by race for
all study measures. In addition, Table 2 contains the results of
simple t-tests that were conducted to see if the means differ
significantly for older White and older African American adults.
Religious meaning. --A series of questions were developed
especially for this study to assess religious meaning. It is
important to discuss briefly how these items were written.
Before the nationwide survey was conducted, 3 years were
spent conducting a series of focus groups, in-depth interviews,
and cognitive interviews with a separate group of 399 older
White and older Black adults (see Krause, 2002, for a detailed
discussion of this item development strategy). The goal of this
intensive item development program was to craft a set of
religion measures that capture the way older White and older
Black people experience religion in daily life. Throughout, the
intent was to maximize the salience of the items by using the
respondents' own words to write the question stems.
As shown in Table 1, religious meaning is measured with six
items. Following the recommendations of the Fetzer Institute/
National Institute on Aging Working Group, these questions
were written so that they explicitly capture meaning that arises
from religion, and not a more general sense of meaning that
might come from any number of sources (Fetzer Institute/
National Institute on Aging, 1999).
In addition to focusing specifically on religious meaning,
these indicators were crafted with a second measurement issue
in mind. As the members of the Fetzer Institute/National
Institute on Aging (1999) Working Group observed, many
measures that assess a general sense of meaning in life are
confounded with psychological well-being. Evidence of this
may be found in Reker's (1997) definition of a general sense of
meaning in life. In his view, meaning involves, ``... having
a purpose in life, having a sense of direction, a sense of order
and a reason for existence, a clear personal identity ...'' (Reker,
1997, p. 10). By specifying that a clear personal identity is part
of a general sense of meaning in life, Reker (1997) may be
confounding meaning with self-esteem. Consequently, when
the religious meaning items were being developed for the
present study, an effort was made to avoid question stems that
include direct references to well-being outcome measures.
As shown in Table 1, the indicators of religious meaning that
are used in this study are coded so that a high score represents
a greater sense of religious meaning in life. An exploratory
factor analysis revealed that the six religious meaning
indicators reflect a single underlying construct. The internal

KRAUSE
S164
consistency reliability estimate for this newly devised scale
(.946) is quite good and provides one way of demonstrating
that the time-consuming, item development strategy used in this
study was justified (Krause, 2002).
Life satisfaction. --A brief three-item measure of life
satisfaction was administered to the subjects in this study.
The first two indicators come from the Life Satisfaction Index
A (Neugarten, Havighurst, & Tobin, 1961). The third-listed
item assesses satisfaction with life as a whole. A high score on
these indicators means that study participants feel more
satisfied with the way their lives have turned out. The internal
consistency reliability estimate for this short scale is .721.
Self-esteem. --Three items were also used to assess self-
esteem. These indicators come from the widely used scale that
was developed by Rosenberg (1965). A high score denotes
greater feelings of self-worth. The reliability estimate for this
brief composite is .907.
Optimism. --Optimism was measured with three indicators.
Two come from the scale developed by Scheier and Carver
(1985). These items assess whether study participants expect
the best in uncertain times and whether they are optimistic
about the future. The third item deals with feeling confident that
the rest of one's life will turn out well. This indicator was based
on insights provided by the respondents in the qualitative work
that was discussed earlier (Krause, 2002). More specifically,
a number of older study participants indicated their faith made
them feel that no matter what may happen in the future, things
will turn out well. All three indicators are coded so that a high
score denotes greater optimism. The reliability estimate for this
scale is .816.
Race. --A binary variable was used to contrast older White
(scored 1) with older African American adults (scored 0).
Religious control measures. --To show that religious
meaning is worthy of further investigation, it is important to
show that it exerts a significant effect even after the influence of
other well-known religious correlates of well-being are
controlled statistically. Two additional religion measures were
included in the analysis for this purpose. As shown in Table 1,
the first assesses the frequency of church attendance, whereas
the second measures the frequency of private prayer. These
indicators are coded so that a high score reflects more frequent
church attendance or more frequent private prayer.
Demographic control measures. --The relationship between
religious meaning and psychological well-being was assessed
after the effects of age, sex, education, and marital status were
controlled statistically. Age is scored in a continuous format.
Similarly, education is coded in a continuous format reflecting
the total number of years of completed schooling. Sex is a binary
variable contrasting men (scored 1) with women (scored 0), and
marital status is a binary indicator in which a score of 1 is
assigned to older study participants who were married at the
time of the survey, and a score of 0 stands for older people who
were not married when the interview took place.
Data Analysis Strategy
Three hypotheses are evaluated in this study. The first two
are designed to test the differential involvement perspective.
The first hypothesis states that older African American adults
should report higher levels of religious meaning than older
White adults. The second specifies that religious meaning
should, in turn, be positively associated with life satisfaction,
self-esteem, and optimism. Tests of these hypotheses will be
conducted using ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple re-
gression analysis. The first hypothesis will be evaluated by
regressing religious meaning on race and the control variables,
whereas the second will be assessed by regressing well-being
on religious meaning and the other study measures.
Hypothesis 3 is more complex and is designed to evaluate the
differential impact perspective. This hypothesis states that the
relationship between religious meaning and well-being will be
stronger for older Black than older White people. Stated in more
technical terms, this specification calls for a statistical interaction
effect between race and religious meaning on well-being.
Hypothesis 3 will also be evaluated with OLS multiple regression
procedures. However, in this instance, the regression equations
will be estimated in a three-step hierarchical fashion. The additive
effects of church attendance, private prayer, race, and the control
measures will be entered in the first step. In the second step,
religious meaning will be added to the model. This makes it
possible to evaluate an issue that has not been discussed up to this
point. More specifically, a good deal of research indicates that the
frequency of church attendance and private prayer are associated
with subjective well-being in late life (Koenig et al., 2001).
However, it is not entirely clear why these behavioral measures of
religion are related to well-being. The second step in the
hierarchical regression analysis tests the proposition that older
people who go to church often and pray frequently enjoy a greater
sense of well-being, because these religious activities foster
a sense of meaning in life. Evidence of this would be found if the

strength of the relationship between church attendance and well-
being, as well as private prayer and well-being, is diminished
after religious meaning is entered into the equation.
The third step in the hierarchical analysis tests the proposed
statistical interaction effect between race and religious meaning
on well-being. This step is executed by adding a multiplicative
or cross-product term to the model (religious meaning 3 race).
The size of this multiplicative term reflects the difference
between the net effects of religious meaning on well-being for
older White people and the net effects of religious meaning
on well-being for older Black people. The procedures described
by Aiken and West (1991) are used to interpret and evaluate the
interactions that emerge between race and religious meaning on
well-being. More specifically, these hand calculations yield
three estimates: (1) unstandardized regression coefficients
representing the relationship between religious meaning and
well-being for older Black and older White people, respec-
tively; (2) t-tests that are designed to see if these coefficients
differ significantly from zero; and (3) standardized regression
coefficients for the relationship between religious meaning and
well-being in each racial group.
RESULTS
The findings are presented here in two sections. First, tests of
the differential involvement perspective are conducted. Fol-
lowing this, the differential impact perspective is evaluated.
Differential Involvement
Table 3 contains the findings from the regressions analysis
that were designed to see if levels of religious meaning are
higher in older Black than older White adults. These analyses
were performed in two steps. The demographic variables and
the binary race indicator were entered into the equation in Step
1 (see Model 1 in Table 3). Then, the frequency of church
attendance and private prayer were added to these independent
variables in Step 2 (see Model 2). The findings from Model 1 re-
veal that, compared with older Black adults, older White adults
are less likely to find a sense of meaning in religion (Beta 5
2.252; p , .001). The observed race difference in religious
meaning continues to be statistically significant after church
attendance and private prayer are entered into the equation, but
the size of the standardized regression coefficient is reduced by
about 60% (Beta 5 2.101; p , .001). Taken together, the
findings from both models reveal that older Black people are
more likely than older White people to find meaning in religion,
and this race difference is largely because older Black adults pray
more often and attend church more frequently than older White
adults. Viewed more broadly, the data support an important facet
of the differential involvement perspective: Older Black people
are more likely than older White people to derive a sense of
meaning from their faith. However, for the differential in-
volvement perspective to be fully evaluated, it is important to
show that religious meaning is, in turn, associated with well-
being. This issue is addressed in the next section in the process of
evaluating the differential impact perspective.
Differential Impact
Life satisfaction. --Table 4 contains the results of the
analyses that were designed to explore the relationships among
race, religion, and life satisfaction. The data in the left-hand
column of this table (Model 1) reveal that older adults who
attend church often (Beta 5 .078; p , .05) and older people
who pray frequently (Beta 5 .124; p , .001) tend to have
a greater sense of life satisfaction than older adults who do not
go to church or pray often. However, two important findings
emerge from the data when religious meaning is entered into
the equation (see Model 2). First, church attendance (Beta 5
.015; ns) and private prayer (Beta 5 2.005; ns) no longer exert
a statistically significant influence on feelings of life satisfac-
tion. This suggests that the frequently observed relationship
between these behavioral measures of religion and life sat-
isfaction may be explained by the new measure of religious
meaning that was developed for this study. The second major
finding to emerge from Model 2 has to do with the additive
effects of religious meaning on well-being. More specifically,
the data suggest that, for the sample taken as a whole, greater
religious meaning is associated with greater life satisfaction
(Beta 5 .293; p , .001). When coupled with the results pre-
sented in the previous section, these data provide support for
the differential involvement perspective. More specifically,
these findings suggest that, compared with older White adults,
religious meaning appears to play a larger role in shaping life
satisfaction among older Black persons.
The data on the right-hand side of Table 3 (Model 2) reveal
further that the differential impact perspective may provide
valuable insight, as well. More specifically, the findings suggest
there is a statistically significant interaction effect between race
and religious meaning on life satisfaction (b 5 2.145; p ,
.001; unstandardized regression coefficients are discussed
because standardized estimates are meaningless in this context).
Based on the procedures provided by Aiken and West (1991),
further hand calculations reveal that the size of the relationship
between religious meaning and psychological well-being for
older Black adults (Beta 5 .447; p , .001) is about two and
a half times larger than the corresponding estimate for older
White adults (Beta 5 .170; p , .001). Viewed more generally,
these data indicate that, although religious meaning appears to

bolster the life satisfaction of both older White and older Black
adults, older African Americans may enjoy a substantially
greater benefit.
Self-esteem. --Findings from the analyses that were designed
to explore the relationships among race, religion, and self-
esteem are provided in Table 5. The data in the left-hand
column of this table (Model 1) reveal that older adults who go
to church often tend to have greater feelings of self-worth than
older people who do not go to church as frequently (Beta 5
.142; p , .001). But, in contrast, the frequency of private
prayer is not significantly related to self-esteem (Beta 5 .050;
ns). Nevertheless, as the data provided by Model 2 reveal, the
relationship between church attendance, private prayer, and
self-esteem changes once religious meaning is added to the
equation. More specifically, the size of the relationship between
church attendance and self-esteem is reduced by about 45%
(Beta 5 .078; p , .05), but the relationship between private
prayer and self-esteem changes in a way that initially is
somewhat surprising. In particular, the data indicate that older
people who pray more often tend to have lower feelings of self-
worth (Beta 5 2.081; p , .05). Finally, the data in Model 2
suggest that, as anticipated, older people who find a strong
sense of meaning in their faith tend to have greater feelings of
self-worth than older adults who do not derive a sense of
meaning from religion (Beta 5 .301; p , .001).
Two important findings emerge from the data provided by
Model 3. First, the unanticipated relationship between private
prayer and self-esteem disappears (Beta 5 2.049; ns) once tests
are performed for the interaction between race and religious
meaning on self-esteem. This means that the unexpected finding
that emerged in Model 2 is because this model was misspecified
(i.e., the relationship between race and religious meaning was
not assessed properly). The second, and more important, result
to emerge from Model 3 suggests that the relationship between
religious meaning and self-esteem appears to be stronger for
older Black than for older White people (b 5 2.115; p , .001).
The nature of these race differences may be illustrated more
clearly with the procedures provided by Aiken and West (1991).
These additional analyses indicate that the relationship between
religious meaning and self-esteem among older Black adults
(Beta 5 .456; p , .001) is approximately two and a half times
larger than that of older White adults (Beta 5 .183; p , .001).
Taken as a whole, the results presented in this section suggest
that both the differential involvement and the differential impact
perspectives help explain why religious meaning plays a larger
role in shaping feelings of self-worth among older Blacks than
older White adults.
Optimism. --The data in Table 6 reveal that older people who
go to church frequently tend to be more optimistic than older
adults who do not attend church as often (Beta 5 .181; p ,
.001; see Model 1). But, in contrast, private prayer does not
appear to be significantly associated with a sense of optimism
(Beta 5 .048; ns). However, as with the other well-being
outcome measures, the relationship between church attendance,
private prayer, and optimism changes once religious meaning is
added to the equation (see Model 2). More specifically, after the
effects of religious meaning are taken into account, the size of
the relationship between church attendance and optimism is
reduced by approximately 44%. This suggests that religious
meaning explains part of the reason why church attendance is
associated with optimism in late life. However, the data in
Table 6 further reveal that once religious meaning is added to
the equation, private prayer appears to have a negative effect on
optimism (Beta 5 2.120; p , .001). Finally, the results from

RELIGIOUS MEANING S167
Model 2 indicate that, as anticipated, older people who derive
a strong sense of meaning from religion tend to be more
optimistic than older adults who do not find meaning in religion
(Beta 5 .381; p , .001).
Two major findings emerge from the data once tests are
performed to assess the proposed interaction effect between
race and religious meaning on optimism. First, correctly
specifying the relationship between race and religious meaning
tends to reduce, but not completely eliminate, the negative
relationship between private prayer and optimism (Beta 5
2.084; p , .05). Although it is difficult to explain these
unanticipated findings, it should be kept in mind that the size of
this relationship is not large (2.084). Perhaps these results
reflect the possibility that older people with a low sense of
optimism pray more often in an effort to feel more positive
about the future. This issue should be explored in future
studies. The second major finding to emerge from Model 3 has
to do with the proposed interaction effect between race and
religious meaning on optimism. As the data in the right-hand
side of Table 6 suggest (Model 3), the relationship between
religious meaning and optimism is significantly larger for older
African American people (b 5 2.134; p , .001). More
specifically, the additional hand calculations reveal that the
association between religious meaning and optimism is about
twice as large for older Black people (Beta 5 .552; p , .001)
than older White people (Beta 5 .253; p , .001).
DISCUSSION
Recently, some investigators have argued that the literature
on race, religion, and psychological well-being is ``limited,''
and that a number of facets of religion have yet to be explored
fully (Mattis & Jagers, 2001, p. 519). The purpose of the
present study was to address this gap in the knowledge base by
focusing on the potentially important influence of one facet of
religion that has been overlooked in many studies--religious
meaning. It was hypothesized that religious meaning is
associated with a greater sense of subjective well-being in late
life. In addition, it was further hypothesized that the beneficial
effects of religious meaning would be especially evident among
older Black people. As Frankl (1963) argued, ``... suffering
ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning''
(p. 135). Older African American adults have clearly experi-
enced a good deal of suffering arising from decades of exposure
to racial prejudice and discrimination (Kessler, Mickelson, &
Williams, 1999). As a result, a major function of the church in
the Black community has been to help African American people
find meaning in the face of racial oppression (Cone, 1997).
Viewed broadly, the data appear to support the hypotheses
that were developed for this study. More specifically, the
findings suggest that greater religious meaning is associated
with more life satisfaction, higher self-esteem, and more
optimism for both older White and older Black adults.
However, the data further reveal that religious meaning may
play a significantly larger role in shaping feelings of well-being
among older Black adults. Two theoretical perspectives were
evaluated to better understand the race differences that emerged
from the data. The differential involvement perspective
suggests that older Black persons are more likely than older
White persons to find meaning in religion, and that people who
find meaning in religion, in turn, enjoy a greater sense of well-
being. In contrast, the differential impact perspective proposes
that the relationship between religious meaning and well-being
will be stronger for older Black adults than for older White
adults, and the difference may be because of an underlying
qualitative difference in the nature of religious meaning in the
Black community. The data provide strong support for both
perspectives. More specifically, the findings indicate that older
Black people enjoy a greater sense of well-being because they
derive a greater sense of meaning from religion than older
White people, and because the impact of religious meaning on
well-being is stronger for older Black than older White adults.
The findings from this study are noteworthy for several
reasons. First, the analyses are based on data provided by
a nationwide sample of older White and older Black adults.
Second, carefully crafted measures were used that focus
specifically on meaning that arises from religion. This appears
to be the first time that anyone has explicitly evaluated the
relationship between religious meaning and well-being in late
life. Third, because a range of outcome measures were used, it
was possible to show that the positive influence of religious
meaning is fairly broad-based, instead of being manifest in one
specific outcome (e.g., life satisfaction only). Fourth, this
appears to be the first time the differential involvement and
differential impact perspectives have been evaluated empiri-
cally within the context of religious meaning.
Although the findings from this study may make a contribu-
tion to the literature, a great deal of work remains to be done. To
begin with, it is important to know more about why religious
meaning may bolster feelings of well-being in late life.
Although a number of factors are likely to be involved, stressful
life events may play an important role in this process. More
specifically, religious meaning may exert a positive influence on
well-being, because it helps older people cope more effectively
with the pernicious effects of stress (Musick, 2000).

In addition, it is important to learn more about why religious
meaning enhances the subjective well-being of older Black than
older White people. The items used to assess meaning in this
study ask whether religion provides a sense of purpose and
understanding of life, but these indicators do not explicitly
capture the unique social circumstances that older Black adults
must grapple with to derive a sense of meaning in life. This was
necessary so that older White and older Black persons could be
compared and contrasted. But now it is time to take the next
step and explore more focused facets of religious meaning.
Perhaps, as Paris (1995) and others have argued, religion helps
older African American adults better understand the suffering
associated with slavery, racial prejudice, and discrimination. To
the extent this is true, a stronger relationship may emerge if
researchers use measures of religious meaning that focus
specifically on these racial problems.
It would also be useful to know more about how a sense of
religious meaning arises in the first place. Earlier, evidence was
provided that older people who go to church more often and
who pray more often tend to find a greater sense of meaning in
religion. But there is likely to be more to it than this. For
example, a number of researchers have argued that religion has
a strong social foundation, and this communal or interpersonal
emphasis is more evident in the Black community (Mattis &
Jagers, 2001; Paris, 1995). If this is true, then perhaps spiritual
support (i.e., mutual encouragement to adopt and practice
various tenets of religion) found in church settings may be an
important source of religious meaning, especially for older
African American people.
Finally, as noted previously, a number of studies indicate that
a general sense of meaning in life is associated with enhanced
feelings of well-being (Reker, 1997). However, the findings
presented herein suggest that meaning arising specifically from
religion is also related to well-being. Consequently, research is
needed to compare and contrast directly the two measures of
meaning to see which is more strongly associated with well-
being. This type of analysis should help resolve a long-standing
debate in the literature about whether meaning arising
specifically from religion is more important than a generalized
sense of meaning that arises from a number of different sources
(Naiditch, 2000).
In the process of exploring this as well as other issues related
to religious meaning, researchers would benefit from paying
attention to the limitations in the present study. One is especially
important. The analyses were based on data that were gathered
at one point in time only. As a result, the temporal ordering of
the relationship between religious meaning and well-being was
based on theoretical considerations alone. The inherent problem
in using cross-sectional data may be illustrated by turning to the
literature on a general sense of meaning in life and self-esteem.
Researchers have specified the nature of the causal relationship
between these constructs in nearly every possible way. For
example, some investigators argue that meaning is a source of
self-esteem (Reker, 1997), others assert that self-esteem is
actually a dimension or component of meaning (Park &
Folkman, 1997), whereas other researchers maintain that high
self-esteem promotes a sense of meaning in life (Hoyle, Kernis,
Leary, & Baldwin, 1999). This issue can only be addressed with
a strong theoretical rationale and data that have been gathered at
three or more points in time.
Writing in 1931, Jung noted that, ``The least of things with
a meaning is always worth more than the greatest of things
without it'' (Jung, 1953, p. 285). In essence, Jung (1953)
suggested that nothing in life has value, unless it is meaningful.
Although there are a number of ways to find meaning in life
(Fowler, 1981), religion may play a particularly important role
in this respect. This is especially true given the nature of the
challenges that must be faced in late life, including death. Yet
researchers know so little about religious meaning. Relatively
little evidenced-based research exists to show how it arises, and
little is known about how it helps those who face significant
adversity, such as older African American people. Viewed
broadly, the purpose of this study has been to bring religious
meaning to the foreground by showing that it may play
a significant role in shaping constructs of long-standing interest
in social gerontology (i.e., life satisfaction, self-esteem, and
optimism). Perhaps no facet of religion is as elusive as
meaning. Yet, no other dimension of religion may have the
potential to capture the core issues involved in negotiating the
final decades of life.
