Introduction
Anovel field of research has recently emerged among polit-
ical behavioralists. This research agenda has focused on the
relationship between physiological responses and political
issue preferences and partisanship. A seminal work in the
field thus far is Oxley et al. (2008), which demonstrates that
those with higher physiological sensitivity to threatening
stimuli generally tend to support more conservative politi-
cal policies and vice versa. It suggests that those with a
higher threat sensitivity support conservative policies that
seek to "protect" the status quo from threats. Several other
studies (e.g. Balzer and Jacobs, 2011; Dodd et al., 2012;
Gruszczynski et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2011; Wagner et al.,
2014) have been largely successful in demonstrating addi-
tional evidence in support of this phenomenon, specifically
that a variety of political attitudes and behaviors seem to be
clearly associated with physiological response patterns.
This research implies strong evidence for the evolutionary
origins of human political behavior (see e.g. Hatemi and
McDermott, 2011).
Despite these compelling findings, much of the recent
research focused specifically on the relationship between
political behavior and skin conductance response to threat-
ening and disgusting stimuli is based on analyses of a data
collection sample of approximately 200 study participants
described first by Oxley et al. (2008). The objective of this
analysis, then, is to attempt to reproduce1 the findings of
some of these early studies, specifically in regards to skin
conductance response to threatening and disgusting stimuli,
using a novel and unique dataset produced in a different
context. To briefly preview the findings, we are unable to
reproduce many of the findings of previous research on the
link between skin conductance response and political atti-
tudes in our novel context. This suggests that the previous

Abstract
One of the most provocative recent findings in our understanding of political behavior is the link between physiological
responses to environmental stimuli and political attitudes and behavior. This line of research holds much promise in
explaining some of the foundational evolutionary origins of basic political orientations. Much of this recent research
focused specifically on skin conductance response to threatening and disgusting stimuli, however, is based on analyses
of a data collection sample of approximately 200 study participants drawn from the same community at a single point in
time. Herein we attempt to reproduce many of the basic findings of recent research on skin conductance response and
political behavior using data collected from a novel and unique dataset in a different context. In brief, we fail to reproduce
many of the basic findings from this incipient line of research which suggests that the link between skin conductance and
political behavior may be more contingent than previously assumed.

may be more contingent than previously assumed, specifi-
cally that it may be contingent upon subject age and its
effect on the stability of political attitudes.
Physiological responses and political
behavior
Recent studies of the link between physiological responses
and political behavior have investigated a variety of differ-
ent biological mechanisms. Many researchers have investi-
gated the role of emotional response and cognitive
processing (see e.g. Lodge and Taber, 2005; Mutz and
Reeves, 2005; Redlawsk et al., 2010). Others have used
MRI and EEG brain imaging to measure differences between
self-identified liberals and conservatives in the way they
process information--especially what regions of the brain
react when facing a risky decision or which areas have
increased gray matter data (Amodio et al., 2007; Giuseffi,
2012; Kanai et al., 2011; Schreiber et al., 2013). Others have
measured response valences and found that conservatives
were quicker to respond to negative images and biased
toward negative outcomes and situations (Carraro et al.,
2011; Hibbing et al., 2014; Shook and Fazio, 2009). Dodd
et al. (2011) measured gaze cuing effects and found that lib-
erals were more influenced by gaze cues and argued that
conservatives value personal autonomy more so than liber-
als and therefore are less likely to be responsive to gaze
cues. Vigil (2010) measured facial expressions in college
students and discovered that Republican sympathizers were
more likely to interpret faces as signaling threatening
expressions or dominant emotions and political affiliation
was independently related to perceptions of threatening
facial expressions, whereas the demographic variables were
not significantly related (see also Vigil and Strenth, 2014).
More recently, Adams et al. (2014) found that exposure to a
repugnant odor (which activates the disgust response)
moved subjects to be more likely to oppose socially liberal
political policies, including gay marriage. (For a more com-
prehensive treatment of the literature on physiological
response and political behavior, see Hatemi and McDermott,
2011; Hibbing et al., 2013; Tuschman, 2013.)
Other researchers have focused specifically on physio-
logical threat response, as measured most often by skin
conductance (sweat response), which is the focus of the
current study. The first major examination of the link spe-
cifically between skin conductance levels (SCL) and politi-
cal attitudes is Oxley et al. (2008). In this study, 46
participants were shown a series of threatening images and
their change in SCL and mean blink amplitude (intensity of
blink response) were measured to indicate levels of physi-
ological threat arousal on the part of participants.According
to the authors, those who exhibited lower physical sensi-
tivities to threatening images were "more likely to support
foreign aid, liberal immigration policies, pacifism, and gun
control" (Oxley et al., 2008: 1667). In contrast, those who
exhibited higher reactions to the same stimuli were "more
likely to favor defense spending, capital punishment, patri-
otism, and the Iraq War" (Oxley et al., 2008: 1667), policies
that were interpreted by the authors as preferences for poli-
cies that protect the status quo from threats.
While research on the relationship between physiologi-
cal response and political and social attitudes are growing,
as far as we were able to determine as of the writing of this
report there have been only six additional published studies
in peer-reviewed outlets that specifically investigate the
link between physiological response as measured by SCL
and political attitudes.
Smith et al. (2011) and Balzer and Jacobs (2011), for
example, both used SCL change to measure disgust sensi-
tivity and determine its relationship to policy preferences.
Smith, et al. (2011) determined that gay marriage was the
only issue significantly related to SCL change in response
to disgusting stimuli. Similarly, Balzer and Jacobs (2011)
determined that disgust sensitivity (both self-reported and
physiological) easily separated supporters and opponents
of gay marriage.
In another study, Dodd et al. (2012) measured changes in
both SCL and attentiveness to the visual stimuli being pre-
sented. They successfully reproduced Oxley et al.'s (2008)
finding that links SCL response to threatening images with
conservative political orientations. They also find that com-
pared with individuals on the political left, those on the right
pay more attention to aversive stimuli and exhibit greater
physiological responsiveness to said stimuli.
Renshon et al. (2014) attempted to establish a connec-
tion between anxiety emotions and attitudes toward immi-
gration. They found that emotions incidental to the decision
process can have significant effects on immigration atti-
tudes, and that these are mediated by levels of SCLresponse
to anxiety-inducing stimuli. In other words, physiological
responses are important because they can affect the rela-
tionship between emotions and political attitudes.
Others have broadened both the independent and
dependent variables. Gruszczynski et al. (2013) broadened
the dependent variable to political behavior and found that,
on average, those individuals that were more physiologi-
cally responsive to both threatening and disgusting images
were also more likely to participate in politics, as measured
by a multi-item "participation scale." Wagner et al. (2014)
examined SLC response not to threatening/non-threatening
images but instead to images of President Obama and found
that the SCL response to Obama's image predicts intensity
of opinions toward both Obama and health care reform.
Current objectives
As can be seen, the weight of the evidence thus far has
established a clear relationship between higher skin con-
ductance response sensitivity and conservative political
attitudes. In that light, it is important to note that the seven
Knoll et al. 3
studies described in the previous section which have estab-
lished the evidence for the relationship between SCL
response patterns and political attitudes (Balzer and
Jacobs, 2011; Dodd et al., 2012; Gruszczynski et al., 2013;
Oxley et al., 2008; Renshon et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2011;
Wagner et al., 2014) examined only three distinct data
samples. When it comes to studies examining SCL threat
and disgust response specifically, each analyzed data col-
lected from the same single original sample of individuals
recruited from the Lincoln, Nebraska area in the summer
of 2007, although different studies feature analyses of dif-
ferent subgroups drawn from the original recruitment sam-
ple of approximately 200 individuals (Oxley et al., 2008:
SOM page 2). (See Table 1 in the Supplementary Online
Materials [SOM] for details on the various samples for
these seven studies.)
To bolster their generalizability, it is important that these
findings for SCL threat and disgust response be reproduced
in a variety of contexts from diverse samples. Thus far the
evidence for the link between SCL threat response and
political orientations is based on a single data collection
sample. Thus, our current objective is to determine whether
or not these same patterns exist by attempting to reproduce
the same results in a different context using a unique data-
set collected from a novel sample. We focus specifically on
studies examining SCL threat, non-threat, and disgust
response (Dodd et al., 2012; Oxley et al., 2008; Smith et al.,
2011).
In order to evaluate the generalizability of these previ-
ous findings, we conducted a skin conductance and threat
stimuli procedure modeled after those used by previous
researchers in this field (Balzer and Jacobs, 2011; Dodd
et al., 2012; Gruszczynski et al., 2013; Oxley et al., 2008;
Smith et al., 2011), but varying slightly the images and
question wording in the procedure as well as the sample,
which consisted of 69 students recruited from both general
education (43%) and upper-level political science courses
(57%) at Centre College, a selective liberal arts institution
in the central south region of the United States. Of the
undergraduate-aged sample, 57% were female and 43%
male, 55% self-identified Democrats or leaners, 38%
Republicans or leaners, 7% pure Independents, 50% liber-
als, 26% moderates, and 24% conservative. Further, 89% of
subjects reported having strong opinions toward at least
one political issue, with a mean of 8.22 on a 0­10 scale of
intensity of opinion toward that issue (more details availa-
ble in the SOM materials).
It is important to note that this procedure does not repre-
sent a pure "replication" of the previous studies but rather
an attempt to "reproduce" the same findings in a novel con-
text with slightly varying conditions in order to determine
the extent of their generalizability (see note 1; full details of
the procedure are available in the SOM). This is important
given how influential this body of research has become in
recent years.
Reproduction of Oxley et al. (2008)
We begin with a reproduction of Oxley et al.'s (2008) find-
ings related to SCL change and political attitudes. (A full
description of the reproduction procedure is included in the
SOM.) First, we note that similar to Oxley et al. (2008),
subjects in our sample responded with higher mean levels
of SCL change to threatening images than non-threatening
images (0.00163 logged Hz and -0.00013 logged Hz,
respectively), although this effect is smaller than that
reported by Oxley et al. (2008). (Compare mean values of
0.004 and -0.0025 to the Oxley et al. 2008 sample, as
reported in Oxley et al. 2008 SOM, page 4.) This is impor-
tant because it shows that subjects were indeed responding
differently to threatening vs. non-threatening stimuli in
terms of physiological SCL threat response, and in the
expected direction (see Figure 1).
Next, we conduct difference of means t-tests to repro-
duce the analyses regarding the relationship between change
in SCL in response to threatening/non-threatening images
and support for protective policies. In terms of SCLresponse
to threatening images, we find that, contrary to Oxley et al.
(2008), those with high levels of support for protective poli-
cies actually have lower average levels of change in SCL
levels (-0.0007 logged Hz) compared to those with low lev-
els of support (0.0055 logged Hz). We also find that this
difference fails to achieve statistical significance (t=1.046;
p=0.300). In terms of non-threatening visual stimuli, we
also find no significant difference in non-threatening SCL
levels between these two groups (t=­1.5004; p=0.139).
Next, we reproduce Tables 1 and 2 of Oxley et al. (2008)
that regress support for protective policies on threatening
and non-threatening SCL responses.2 Table 1 shows the
results of the model predicting support for protective poli-
cies (0­5 additive index scale) using SCLchange in response
to threatening images as the key independent variable with

and non-threatening stimuli, comparison of Oxley et al. (2008)
and current study.
4 Research and Politics 
gender (female=1; male=0) and family income (9-point
ordinal variable) as controls.
Whereas the coefficient for threatening image SCL
change in Oxley et al. (2008) achieved statistical signifi-
cance (p<0.05), ours did not (p=0.180). Next, Table 2
reproduces Oxley et al. (2008) Table 2. This is identical to
the model displayed previously in Table 2 except that the
key independent variable of interest is SCL change in
response to non-threatening stimuli.
Here we observe that, in line with Oxley et al. (2008),
the coefficient for SCL change in response to non-threaten-
ing images fails to achieve statistical significance in pre-
dicting support for protective policies.
In sum, we fail to reproduce Oxley et al.'s (2008) key
findings related to the relationship between SCL change in
response to threatening visual stimuli and support for pro-
tective policies in our novel context. We are, however, able
to reproduce the finding that SCL changes in response to
non-threatening visual stimuli have no significant relation-
ship with support for protective policies.
Reproduction of Smith et al. (2011)
Smith et al. (2011) take a slightly different approach in ana-
lyzing the relationship between physiological response pat-
terns and political attitudes. In contrast to Oxley et al.
(2008), who analyze responses to threatening visual stimuli,
Smith et al. (2011) focus on physiological responses to dis-
gusting stimuli. Specifically, they measure SCL change (and
heart rate change) in response to images of a "horribly ema-
ciated but alive body, human excrement floating in a toilet,
a bloody wound, and an open sore with maggots in it"
(Smith et al., 2011). They argue that the disgust response is
important to understand as separate from the threat response
because of its unique interaction with sociopolitical atti-
tudes and behavior, particular through the predictions of
"moral foundations theory" (Haidt, 2012; Haidt and Hersh,
2001). Smith et al.'s (2011) sample is drawn from the same
original 2007 Nebraska sample of 200 individuals, but is a
different subset than that analyzed by Oxley et al. (2008).
First, we observe that similar to Smith et al. (2011), sub-
jects in our study responded with increased SCL to disgust-
ing stimuli (mean 0.00273 logged Hz). Next, we attempt to
reproduce Smith et al.'s (2011) first finding that SCL
responses to disgusting images predict self-report political
ideology. (A full description of the reproduction procedure
is included in the SOM.) We estimate an OLS model with
ideology as the dependent variable and SCLdisgust response
and gender as independent variables and the results are dis-
played in Table 3. While the coefficient is in the right direc-
tion (conservative = higher SCL response), the coefficient in
Table 3 fails to achieve significance (p=0.195).
Next, we attempt to reproduce the finding that the SCL
disgust response predicts attitudes toward gay marriage. We
again estimate an OLS model identical to that found in Table
3 except substituting gay marriage attitudes for ideology as
the dependent variable; the results are displayed in Table 4.
Again, the SCL disgust response fails to significantly pre-
dict attitudes toward gay marriage (p=0.498) and the coef-
ficient, while insignificant, is in the wrong direction (higher
SCL response associated with more liberal gay marriage
attitudes).
Reproduction of Dodd et al. (2012)
Among other things, Dodd et al. (2012) focus on SCL lev-
els in response to threatening and non-threatening images
(identical images and subject pool as described in Oxley
et al. 2008) and analyzed the relationship between SCL
change in response to these images and "political
orientation"--a scale index variable formed by combining
self-report partisanship, ideology, preferences on 28 politi-
cal policies, and responses to 15 "social principles" index
(Dodd et al., 2012: 642).
First, we examine Dodd, et al.'s (2012) finding regard-
ing differences in SCL levels between those on the right
and left side of the "political orientation" scale. (A full
description of the reproduction procedure is included in the
SOM.) We find no statistically significant difference
between those with left and right orientations in SCL
responses to threatening ("aversive") images (t=­1.256;
p=0.214, N=56), nor do we find any significant difference
in SCL responses to non-threatening ("appetitive") images

(t=-0.032; p=0.974, N=56). A MANOVA analysis reveals a
similar non-significant result (F=0.78; p=0.465).
Second, we attempt to reproduce the OLS analysis using
threatening SCL responses to predict political orientation
levels. The model is found in Table 5 and, again, the coef-
ficient for SCL change to threatening images fails to
achieve significance (p=0.637).
In sum, we are unable to reproduce the key findings of
Dodd et al. (2012) that changes in SCL levels in response to
threatening ("aversive") images is meaningfully related to
broad political orientations.
Discussion and conclusion
This analysis was able to reproduce some findings in our
novel context while unable to reproduce several others.
(Table 2 of the SOM summarizes each specific finding
from the literature and its reproduction result.)
Specifically, we successfully reproduced findings related
to SCL response in the face of threatening, non-threaten-
ing, and disgusting stimuli, as well as the non-relation-
ship between SCL response to non-threatening images
and political behavior. In contrast, we were unable to
reproduce the arguably more critical findings related to
physiological responses to threatening images. In our
particular sample at least, there appears to be very little
discernible relationship between responses to threatening
or disgusting visual stimuli and attitudes such as ideology
and political preferences. How should we interpret these
findings given the evidence presented in previous
research demonstrating a clearer relationship between
SCL and political attitudes?
The most obvious (although not exclusive3) possibility
is that the differences between our findings and others is
due to the fact that the subjects in our analysis are college
students while previous studies have analyzed a more rep-
resentative sample of adults in the population who have
more diversity in terms of age, income, and levels of edu-
cation. Previous research has shown that young adults are
less crystalized in their political attitudes and show more
variability than older adults (Sears, 1986) and all of our
sample were likely in their late teens or early twenties with
a heavier skew toward liberal ideological views. This may
therefore suggest an interactive relationship: the link
between physiological response (specifically SCL threat
response) and political attitudes may depend to some
extent on subject age and its effect on the stability of politi-
cal attitudes. That being said, Renshon et al. (2014) found
significant effects of SCL anxiety (but not threat) response
on political attitudes using a sample composed of young
adult males. Also, there is evidence that student samples
are not wholly unrepresentative of the wider population
when it comes to social science attitudes and behavior
(Druckman and Kam, 2011).
Therefore, we conclude that more research is warranted
to further investigate the relationship specifically between
SCL threat and disgust response mechanisms and political
attitudes, as well as the extent to which these relationships
are contingent upon factors such as political interest, age,
etc. Specifically, we call for additional reproductions of this
data collection procedure in a variety of contexts to deter-
mine the extent of generalizability and ubiquity of physio-
logical-political relationships.

Notes
1. We use the terms "reproduction" and "reproduce" intention-
ally throughout so as not to confuse our efforts with a pure
"replication." As is described in the manuscript, we cannot
replicate exactly the original studies due to different subject
pools and specifics of research designs. Instead, we attempt
to "reproduce" the findings under varied conditions for rea-
sons discussed in the manuscript.
2. We note that Oxley et al. (2008) use individual income, educa-
tion, age, and gender as control variables. Given that our sam-
ple consists exclusively of undergraduate students of the same
approximate level of education and age, we exclude these vari-
ables from the models. We also substitute family income for
individual income as students are not working full time. This
same approach is used for all the multivariate reproductions
that follow (Dodd et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2011).
3. An additional explanation is also possible: that the Oxley
et al. (2008) sample was specifically pre-screened for hav-
ing "strong political attitudes" whereas ours did not have a
similar pre-screen is discussed in the SOM.
