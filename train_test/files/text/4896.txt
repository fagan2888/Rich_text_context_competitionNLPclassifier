Introduction
It is well accepted that cholesterol-lowering treat-
ment (e.g. statins) favorably affects development
and progression of atherosclerosis to only a lim-
ited extent in a significant number of patients.1,2
Synthesis of bile acids is a major route of choles-
terol catabolism.3­6 The body produces about
800 mg of cholesterol per day and about half of
that is used for bile acid synthesis, producing
400­600 mg daily. The relationship between
fecal bile acid excretion (BAE) and coronary
artery disease (CAD) has been debated for sev-
eral decades, with some recent cross-sectional
and prospective studies providing conflicting
evidence with regards to the association between
BAE and CAD-associated morbidity and mor-
tality.3,7­13 The reasons for the increased CAD
risk related to BAE remains, however, largely
unexplained. An association between alteration
in BAE and atherosclerosis has thus far been
shown only in cross-sectional studies.13­22
Providing longitudinal information may help to
understand the contribution of BAE to the
cumulative risk load for CAD.
Cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid are the
most abundant primary bile acids. These are syn-
thesized by the liver. Secondary bile acids are the
result of colonic bacterial action on primary bile
acids.5 Secondary bile acids, deoxycholic acid and
lithocholic acid, are the conjugated salts of primary

Abstract
Background: Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) had significantly lower bile acid
excretion (BAE) compared with non-CAD patients, leading to the hypothesis that the inability to
efficiently excrete bile acids leads to coronary atherosclerosis development. We investigated
the long-term role of BAE in CAD development and related mortality in 50 patients with proven
CAD compared with that of 50 patients with chest pain and no CAD (controls) matched for
clinical and laboratory characteristics.
Methods: All subjects received a 4-day standard diet that included ~500 mg of cholesterol.
Fecal bile acids from 24-h stool collections were measured by gas liquid chromatography.
Results: CAD patients excreted lower amounts of total bile acids than controls (p < 0.001),
less deoxycholic acid (p < 0.0001) and less lithocholic acid (p < 0.01). BAE was the best
significant independent laboratory factor that predicted CAD (p < 0.05). Mortality and CAD
development rates were significantly lower for the controls at the 20-year follow up.
Conclusions: These results showed that CAD patients had markedly decreased BAE levels
compared with non-CAD controls. BAE <415 mg/day was associated with increased CAD
long-term mortality. Impaired ability to excrete cholesterol might be considered an additional
independent risk factor for CAD development.

BA-7-alpha-dehydroxylated derivatives. These
account for over 90% of human bile acids.5
In addition to statins, low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-c) can be reduced by increas-
ing bile acid waste and the compensatory hepatic
up-regulation of bile acid synthesis.2,4,14,16,19­24
It is reasonable to speculate that reduced ability
to convert cholesterol to bile acids would lead to
body cholesterol excess.1,2,6­13,23­25 This assump-
tion is supported by reports on animals that do
not develop hypercholesterolemia or atheroscle-
rosis despite being fed cholesterol-rich diets.2,11­
14,20,23,25 Those animals reacted to the high
cholesterol intake by excreting large amounts of
bile acids, while animals with less efficient
excretion of bile acids had increased plasma lev-
els of cholesterol while on a high-cholesterol
diet. The degree of hypercholesterolemia was
inversely correlated to the rate of bile acid
elimination.1,2,11­14,21,23,25
Simonen and Miettinen18 showed that males with
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)
and CAD excreted lower amounts of bile acids
than those with FH and normal coronary arteries.
Rajaratnam and colleagues demonstrated that
postmenopausal women with CAD had ineffi-
cient fecal elimination of cholesterol.7,8 We found
that the CAD patients excreted markedly lower
amounts (approximately 50%) of fecal bile
acids.15 The differences in excretion of bile acids
were mainly due to lower excretion of deoxycholic
and lithocholic acids.15
The purpose of this study was to explore the
long-term effect of decreased BAE on mortality
in relation to CAD during a 20-year follow-up
period. By carrying out a longitudinal study we
intended to verify whether the difference between
patients with and without CAD remained
unchanged, increased or decreased over the
period of time.
Materials and methods
Study design
Subjects with symptoms suggestive of CAD were
enrolled into the study and tested for the presence
of CAD using coronary angiography. CAD-
positive and CAD-negative patients were assayed
for fecal BAE as described below. The follow-up
period averaged 17 years for both groups.
Patient population
All patients hospitalized in our institution with
chest pain suspected as being CAD (angina pecto-
ris, unstable angina or myocardial infarction) were
eligible for participation in this study, which was
conducted from January 1995 through December
2015. They all underwent coronary catheterization
according to clinical criteria (some of them after
noninvasive tests, treadmill ergometry or a thallium
scan) and were divided into two groups: those with
confirmed CAD (demonstration of stenosis greater
than 70% on coronary angiogram) and those with
normal coronary arteries. Excluded were patients
younger than 40 years of age (because of a low risk
for CAD), those with psychiatric disease, malig-
nancy, acute and end-stage renal failure (dialysis),
hepatic disease, severe chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease or acute infectious disease, and those
receiving lipid-lowering drugs. A complete medical
history was taken, and the medical charts of partici-
pants with previous visits to our clinic were reviewed
in order to retrieve data on a history of CAD and
cardiac risk factors ­ diabetes mellitus (DM),
hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking and a body
mass index (BMI) >25. In addition to a physical
examination, the study candidates also underwent
an electrocardiogram, laboratory tests (a complete
blood count, glucose, renal function, liver enzyme,
creatinine kinase) and a lipid profile in order to
ensure they were clinically stable. All patients after
coronary angiography were divided into two
groups: those with confirmed CAD (Group 1) and
those without CAD (Group 2, controls). Regarding
concerns about the possibility that participants in
the non-CAD group had symptomatic coronary
atherosclerosis (i.e. producing pains), it is impor-
tant to emphasize that members of this group had
bona fide normal coronary arteries.
Group 1 patients were enrolled in the study on
condition that they had not undergone any acute
coronary event for at least a previous 3-month
period in order to exclude any effect of infarction-
related metabolic changes. The study was
approved by the local ethics committee and each
entrant signed an informed consent prior to
enrolling (No. 0663-15-TLV.) Retrospective
forms of long-term follow up and survival were
based on electronic health records.
Study protocol
The study was approved by the Ethical Committee
of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center.

All patients performed a 24-h stool collection into
special containers. A continuous non-absorbable
marker was used to evaluate the quantity of stool
excretion. Each subject received 12 capsules of
75 mg copper isothiocyanate to be taken one per
meal for 4 days previous to stool collection, meant to
serve as an internal standard for the purposes of cal-
culation. A few patients did not have a bowel move-
ment after three days of the internal standard (copper
tablets) administration. In those cases copper was
given for a few more days until a stool was passed.
One week prior to the ingestion of this internal
standard, the patients received a standard in-hospi-
tal diet containing 490 mg/day of cholesterol.15,26 A
high-cholesterol diet was well tolerated by all study
participants without any discomfort or diarrhea.
They were asked to record the contents of each
meal consumed. Participants who did not conform
to the strict diet were dropped from the study. Fecal
collection was made only during the hospital stay of
the patients admitted because of chest pain sugges-
tive of ischemic heart disease. All blood samples
were taken on the same day as feces collection.
Quantitative determination of the bile acids in
feces
Determination of bile acids was done as previ-
ously described.15 This method allows for com-
plete recovery and separation of bile acids,
together with a high level of accuracy, reliability
and simplicity in performance. The stools were
collected throughout 24 h, and the amount of bile
acids was determined per 225 mg of copper iso-
thiocyanate that served as an internal stand-
ard.6,18,26,27 The method of determination of free
bile acids and their fractions is described in detail
in our earlier publication.15
Fecal cholesterol excretion in the present work
was exceedingly low in comparison to total BAE.
We deemed these negligible amounts of choles-
terol to have no significant weight in the total
sterol excretion. With a linear detection range of
1­150 mol bile acids, we considered our meth-
odology fairly sensitive and accurate. Coefficient
of variations for bile acids measurements were:
intra-assay 3% and inter-assay 5%.
In an attempt to simplify the assessment of BAE,
the possibility of measuring blood level of surro-
gate markers for the excretion may appear useful.
However, while several assays have been used to
determine both total and individual bile acids in
biological fluids, it should be recognized that less
than 1% of the total bile acid pool is present in the
peripheral blood (2­10 mmol/L) due to the high
efficiency of the hepatic transport mechanism for
bile acids. Moreover, serum BA level is predis-
posed to considerable variation due to alteration
of liver function that is often undetectable by other
liver function tests. Thus, it is not considered a
reliable measure of metabolic risk for CAD.
Measurement of lipids content in the serum
Total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were meas-
ured enzymatically on a Siemens Advia 1650
Chemistry Analyser (Siemens Medical Solutions.
Diamond Diagnostics - USA, Holliston, MA)
using the manufacturer's reagents.15
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables are reported as frequency
and percentages, and continuous variables are
reported as medians and interquartile ranges
(IQR). Continuous variables were tested for a
normal distribution histogram. Categorical varia-
bles were compared between patients with and
without ischemic heart disease (IHD) by use of
the Chi-square test or the Fisher exact test, and
continuous variables by the independent samples
t test or the Mann­Whitney U test.
Bile acids were divided into categories according to
their median value. Kaplan­Meier plots were used
to describe mortality during follow up in patients
with and without IHD and in different bile acid cat-
egories. The log-rank test was used to compare
them. The length of follow up was measured using
the reverse censoring method. The univariate Cox
regression was used to evaluate the association
between bile acids, CAD status, potential confound-
ers and mortality. Each bile acid was assessed by a
separate multivariate Cox regression. The multivari-
ate regression models included age, sex, IHD and
variables with p < 0.2 in the univariate analysis. A
two-tailed p < 0.05 level was considered statistically
significant. Analyses were performed with SPSS
(IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS Statistics for
Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, USA).
Results
A total of 67 males and 33 females (median
age 62 years, IQR 54­68) participated in this
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11

prospective follow-up study. Fifty patients had
been diagnosed with CAD (Group 1: 37 males,
median age 62.5 years, IQR 58­68) and 50
patients were CAD-free (Group 2, controls):
30 males, median age 61 years (IQR 49­67), with
no significant differences in age and gender
(p = 0.123 and p = 0.726, respectively). Thirty
CAD patient and 27 controls participants were
included in a previous report.15
Table 1 lists patients' clinical features, demograph-
ics, laboratory findings and CAD risk factors.
There were no significant differences between the
two groups in their BMI or in the prevalence of
DM, hypertension, smoking or renal failure. They
did, however, differ in total cholesterol and LDL-c
levels. The controls had a slightly higher left ven-
tricular ejection fraction (LVEF) that was clinically
non-significant, although it was statistically signifi-
cant compared with the control group (median 60
versus 55, p = 0.007). The BAEs of cholic and che-
nodeoxycholic acids were similar for both groups
(p = 0.428 and p = 0.921, respectively). Patients
with CAD had significantly lower excretion levels
of deoxycholic (p < 0.001) and lithocholic acids
(p = 0.004) compared with the controls.
The mean follow up was 17.45 years (95% CI:
16.63­18.27), with a similar number of years in
both groups (Group 1: 17.54 years, 95% CI
16.61­18.48; controls: 17.13 years, 95% CI
15.75­18.50). Table 2 shows the patients' clini-
cal, laboratory and demographic data so as to
compare between survivors and patients who died
during follow up. The patients who survived had
markedly higher total bile, deoxycholic and litho-
cholic acid excretion levels (p < 0.001 for all
comparisons). Table 3 lists the crude hazard
ratios (HRs) of each predictor in association with
cardiovascular mortality: only those ratios for
total deoxycholic and lithocholic acids reached a
level of significance (p < 0.001).
Figure 1 displays the patients' cumulative survival
rate according to CAD and in the non-CAD con-
trol group during the 20-year follow up: 76% of
the controls were event-free compared with 16%
of the CAD group (p = 0.002). Figure 2 illus-
trates survival among the patients according to
the amounts of total bile acid excreted during 20
years of follow up. The vast majority (91.1%) of
patients who excreted 415 mg of bile acids sur-
vived for 20 years compared with 16% of those
who excreted <415 mg. Figure 3 describes sur-
vival in patients according to the amounts of
deoxycholic acid excretion during a 20-year
follow up: 79.4% of the patients who excreted
214 mg survived to the end of the 20-year fol-
low-up period compared with 19.3% of the
patients who excreted <214 mg and survived to
the end of the 20-year follow-up period (p < 0.001).
Figure 4 shows similar findings for the compari-
son of the fraction of lithocholic acid: it was
86.3% of the patients who stayed alive for 20
years and excreted 141 mg compared with
18.4% of the patients who stayed alive for 20
years and excreted <141 mg (p < 0.001). Figure 5
shows differences in survival according to cholic
acid excretion. The statistical cut-off point was
14 mg/24 h, and the differences in survival were:
64.0% of the patients who stayed alive for 20
years excreted 14 mg versus 33.1% of the
patients who stayed alive for 20 years excreted
<14 mg (p = 0.65). There were no differences in
survival when the groups were compared for
chenodeoxycholic acid excretion (p > 0.05;
Figure 6). The latter result can be explained by
the fact that very small amounts of this fraction
existed in total BAEs
Multivariate regression analysis was used in order
to define the clinical relevance of total bile acids
in the CAD group. There was no correlation in
any group between fecal bile acids and other lipid
profile components. Table 3 displays adjusted
HRs associated with cardiovascular mortality
according to excreted total bile acids and their
fractions adjusted to age, gender, BMI, CAD,
LVEF, hypertension, smoking, total cholesterol,
LDL, HDL, hemoglobin and creatinine. The
clinical parameters of LVEF, BMI and presence
of renal failure, and the laboratory parameters of
lipid profile and BAE emerged as being signifi-
cant (p < 0.05) independent factors that pre-
dicted CAD. Advanced age, male gender, LVEF,
BMI, creatinine, hemoglobin and the major risk
factors (DM, hypertension, smoking, hypercho-
lesterolemia) for CAD did not correlate with
BAEs. Regarding bile acids excretion-only, total
bile acids and their two fractions as deoxycholic
and lithocholic acids (but not cholic and cheno-
deoxycholic) correlated with CAD.
A total of 28 (56%) patients in Group 1 and 10
controls (20%) died during the 20-year follow up
(p < 0.001). Four patients (8%) of Group 2
developed CAD during the follow up. Four study
participants (8.0%) with a total bile acid level
above the median (415 mg/dL) died compared
with 34 patients (68.0%) with a total bile acid

level <415 mg/dL (HR adjusted 0.14, 95% CI
0.04­0.45, p = 0.001). There was also a trend to
associate between mortality and two main frac-
tions of bile acid, deoxycholic acid and litho-
cholic acid that did not reach a level of significance
in the multivariate analysis. Only 18% (9 patients)
of the participants with a deoxycholic acid level
>214 mg/dL died during the follow up, while
58% (29 patients) of those with a deoxycholic
acid level <214 mg/dL died (HR 0.46, 95% CI
0.18­1.13, p = 0.09). The findings were similar
for the participants with lithocholic acid levels
>141 mg/dL, where 6 (12%) of them died com-
pared with 32 (64%) with lithocholic acid levels
<141 mg/dL (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.15­1.17, p =
0.099).

these findings support the hypothesis that CAD
patients produce and eliminate lower levels of
bile acids than non-CAD individuals, and that
reduced production of bile acids, possibly lead-
ing to accumulation of cholesterol, could result
in advanced atherosclerosis.3,6,15,17,18 The cur-
rent investigation is in line with the few pub-
lished human studies that reported increased
fecal excretion of bile acids to have an athero-
protective effect.4,6,15,17,18 The majority of those
investigations, however, were done on selected
populations. Simonen and Miettinen18 showed
that males with heterozygous FH and CAD
excreted lower amounts of bile acids than con-
trols with FH and normal coronary arteries.
Rajaratnam and colleagues,17 however, showed
that postmenopausal women with CAD had
inefficient fecal elimination of bile acids. Our
group studied earlier a mixed adult population
with and without CAD and showed that CAD
patients eliminated subnormal amounts of
fecal bile acids.3 In the current investigation,
we surveyed 50 CAD patients and 50 non-
CAD patients with a follow-up period of up to
20 years. Our current findings support our
earlier investigations and allow us to reach
more firm conclusions on the crucial effect of
the elimination of fecal bile acids in CAD
development.
The remarkable differences in the amounts of
excreted acids between the current study and
control groups were found particularly in total
bile acids, with deoxycholic acid as the main

fraction. The difference was slightly less obvious,
albeit significant, in the fraction of lithocholic
acid, while there was no difference for cholic and
chenodeoxycholic acids. Based on the current
data, daily excretion of <415 mg total bile acids
might be considered as a cut-off level for increased
risk for CAD development. Amounts of deoxy-
cholic acid <214 mg/24 h and lithocholic acid
<141 mg/24 h can also be considered proathero-
genic indicators.
Based on the significant differences seen only
with secondary (deoxycholic and lithocholic) and
not with primary bile acids (cholic and chenode-
oxycholic), it would appear that gut bacteria-
dependent metabolism of bile acids may be
playing a role. Given that conjugated secondary
bile acids are not absorbed and excreted in the
feces, it is also likely that bacterial enzymes facili-
tating deconjugation would play a significant role.
While these are speculations requiring further

proof, it could open new lines of investigation
related to the role of gut dysbiosis where increased
deconjugation may limit fecal excretion.
We did not find any significant differences in the
amounts of excreted bile acids between patients
with and without hypercholesterolemia, DM,
hypertension, smoking or family history of CAD
(data not shown).
In contrast to total cholesterol, LDL-c and high-
density lipoprotein, there was a correlation between
the plasma triglycerides level and BAE, but only in
the non-CAD group. This can be explained by
rapid and more complete intestinal absorption of
triglycerides due to an excess of intraluminal bile
acids necessary for the emulsification of fats.
A significant percentage of patients were reported
to develop atherosclerosis despite suppression of
cholesterol levels by statin treatment.4,15,18 We
reason that a greater decrease of cholesterol blood
levels can be achieved by increasing cholesterol
disposal. This is particularly true in the case of
patients at high risk for CAD, and it can be accom-
plished by combining statins, ezetimibe, pcsk9
(proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9)
inhibitor-evolocumab treatment with drugs affect-
ing bile acid (and cholesterol) excretion, thus
ensuring optimal management of dyslipidemia.
The objective of the current longitudinal study
was to verify whether the differences in BAE
between patients with CAD and non-CAD indi-
viduals persist, increase or decrease over an
extended period of time. Importantly, some non-
CAD patients can also be expected to develop
coronary disease over a long period of follow up.
We consider that, in high-risk patients who can-
not achieve optimal LDL cholesterol levels while
on statin, ezetimibe or pcsk9 inhibitor, determi-
nation of BAE could help to evaluate whether
adding a bile acid sequestrant may boost choles-
terol lowering.
Study limitations
The sample was relatively small and this could be
the reason why we did not find the impact of
other bile acids, cholic and chenodeoxycholic
acid, on patients' survival. The vast majority of
our data were collected before the widespread use
of statins, but whatever statin use existed it would
have led to underestimation of risk for the natural
history of CAD. Limitations of this analysis
include the absence of any information about sta-
tin use, and its intensity. Only mortality outcomes
were recorded to the extent that nonfatal myocar-
dial infarction (MI) occurred without subsequent
CAD death during follow up. Thus, the risk for
the combined outcomes of CAD death or nonfa-
tal MI and total atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease would be underestimated in both groups.
Our study included patients of predominantly
European origin, thus limiting the generalizability
of our findings. There are the usual limitations to
this retrospective form of long-term follow up
based on electronic health records as noted previ-
ously. Importantly, we do not know what lipid-
regulating therapy was being used by the
participants for the last 10 years of the study, and
this limits the interpretation of data with regard to
the magnitude of the 20-year benefit.
It is reasonable to assume that repeating stool
analysis might yield more accurate results.
However, stool sampling (described in the study
protocol) is laborious and exceedingly challeng-
ing, meaning that repeating stool collection not
only would intolerably burden participants but
could result in a dropout rate risking the whole
project. We thus opted for a single stool collec-
tion, using the same protocol published in two
previous reports.15,26
It appears that BMI was not an independent
determinant of BAE. [We found only weak cor-
relation between BMI and cholic acid (r-0.2,
p = 0.042).]
However, since BMI might affect BAE in an indi-
rect fashion, the lack of homogeneity in BMI may
limit the interpretation of our results.
Based on the significant differences seen only
with secondary (deoxycholic and lithocholic) and
not with primary bile acids (cholic and chenode-
oxycholic), it would appear that gut bacteria-
dependent metabolism of bile acids may be
playing a role. Given that conjugated secondary
bile acids are not absorbed and excreted in the
feces, it is also likely that bacterial enzymes facili-
tating deconjugation would play a significant role.
While these are speculations requiring further
proof, additional lines of investigations related to
the role of gut dysbiosis where increased deconju-
gation may limit fecal excretion are warranted.

Conclusion
The results of the present follow-up study showed
significantly lower amounts of total bile acid,
deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid secretion in
patients with CAD compared with non-CAD
patients. Decreased BAE to a daily level <415 mg
was associated with increased mortality.
In other words, decreased BAE was found to
independently be associated with increased mor-
tality when patients with CAD are compared with
non-CAD individuals. This might support a role
for BAE as an independent risk factor for CAD.
