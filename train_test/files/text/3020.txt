  Background: It has been difficult to conduct representative surveys measuring both sexually transmitted rusease prevalence and behavioral data. This article reviews the literatu re, describes a recent pretest of the feasibility of integrated surveys, and discusses the potential implications.
  Methods: Several national surveys are  reviewed,  inclurung the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys,  a­ tional Health and Social Life Survey, and National Survey of Adolescent Males. The 1994 pretest of the National Survey of Adolescent Males collected urine specimens of male respondents, which were tested for Chlamydia trachomatis using ligase and polymerase chain reaction tests.
  Results: There have not been any prior national surveys that collect clinical measures of STD infection and detailed behav­ ioral data. In the pretest, 85% of the eligible interview respon­ dents provided a urine specimen. Of those tested, 6% were positive for C. trachomatis.
  Conclusions: Combining  behavioral  surveys  with  collection of urine specimens  for  STD  testing  in  representative  samples is feasible. However, ST D testing adds new operation al and ethi­ cal challenges to the conduct of household surveys.


A LONGSTANDING GAP in the study of sexually trans­ mitted diseases (STD s) is the  lack  of  survey  data  that are ge ne rali zable to broader populations, providing both meaningful clinical and behavioral data. Despite recom­ mendations for surveys like thi s from the National Acad­ emy of Sciences and a National Instit ute of Allergy and

Infectious Dise ases study group, there has been little pro­ gress.1.2 Most research in this area has come from either
(I) medical-epidemiologic studies, which include cli ni cal STD  testing  but  are  not  representative  of  broader  popu­ lat ions and often have li ttle  demographic  or  behavioral data , or (2) dem og rap hi c or behavioral surveys that were drawn  to  be  statistically  representative  of  a   population but lack meaningful clinical disease measures.
  The purposes of this article are to ( I ) review the  sci­ entific literature in this area and compare  the  two  ap­ proache s and (2) briefly prese nt findings from a recent feasibility study  that  linked  representative  sample  su r­ veys with STD testing, using li gase chain reaction  (LCR) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR ) tests. Finally  ,  the study concludes with a discussion of  the  implications  of repre se ntative samp le surveys that include both  clin ic al and beha vioral data for improving our understanding of STDs.

Sexuall y Transmitted Disease Prevalence Su rveys
  From a public health perspective, it is  disappointing  that the United States lacks statistica ll y  representative data on the prevalence of certai n STDs, including Chlam ydia trachomatis , Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or hu­ man immunodeficiency virus (HIV ). These gaps make it difficult to identify the extent  of  infections  and  progress in prevention  and  treatment  over time. Inste ad, there  are a cluster of alternative data sources, including the com­ municable disease reporting system, routine screening of special populations, and specia l rese arch studies of clinic patien ts or other limited populations, such as college stu-

dents, prisoners, or detainees,  and  so on. Although  each of these data sources is valuable, they still are not gen­ eralizable to broader populations because  of inherent limits of how samples were constructed.
  The most common ly cited statis tics about STD preva­ lence or incidence come from the joint federal-state communicable disease reporting system that is a funda­ mental component of the public  health  system  for  track­ ing infectious dise ases. Howe ve r,  since  reports  of infection are prim arily based on patient-initiated visits to
  
Nationally representative surveys of the  prevalence  of STD  infection  have  been  rare  because   of   the  expense and logistical complexities. His to rically , clinic al testing required medical staff and a medical setting for specimen collection and initial storage or processing. The only na­ tionally representative estimates of STD prevalence  have been based on the National Hea lth and Nutrition Exami­ nation Survey series (NH ANES ), which is  a  very  com­ plex and relatively costly  survey  effort.  Table  I s  ummarizes three of the report s available from the 1976

11 In addition, the

and may also unde rre present perso ns who have limited access to medical care. A common metaphor is that re­ ported cases may represent the tip of the iceberg. In ad­ dition , comparisons across areas or over time may be biased, owing to variations in the  public  health  systems or reporting requirement s.3 For example, a state with an extensive network of public STD clinics might appear to have a high e r level of STDs than a state dependent on reporting from privat e phy s icians, but the se might be ar­ tifacts of the reporting systems. From a research  perspec­ ti ve, a limitation of the communicable dise ase reporting system is that it lacks detailed information about the per­ sons infected: only minimal demographic trait s are avail­ able, with no behavioral data at all.
  Routine STD screening of certain groups (e.g., Job Corps recruits 4 or family planning clinic patient s5) can provide stronger prevalence data becau se  they  do  not rely on self-initiated referral for medical care; thus , as­ ymptomatic cases are included and there is less bias, ow­ ing to differential access to medical care. Screening data still ha ve limited generalizability: Job Corps recruits or family planning patients are not random member s of the broader pop u lation. Like communicable disease rep orts, screening data often have limited research use becau se there are few behavioral or demographic data about those tested.
  Richer data come from medical studie s  that  explicitly seek  to  collect  both  clinical  mea sure s  and  behavioral data from co nve nie nce sa mp le s, s uch as per so ns at­ tending  certain  clinics  6 ·7  and  youth  in  juvenile  deten­ tion ce nters. 8 Although th ese studie s may use sam plin g methods to select respo nde nt s from the defined  popu ­ lation (e.g ., select a  random  sample  of  pat ie nt s  attend­ ing  the  clinic  during  the   2-   month   data   collection period ),  these  findings  customarily  cannot  be  general­ ized beyond that partic ul ar setting. In so me cases, con­ venience  samples   are   the   only   feasible   method   to study certain population groups. Some high-ri sk sub­ populations, uch as homo sex ual men, runaways,  pros­ titutes, or drug addic ts, are  essentially  impossible  to identify  in  s ufficien tly  large  number  s  through  repre­ sent ati ve sam pling methods, and convenience sample s become more important.

1960  to  1962  National  Health  Examination  Survey (NHES) included syphilis serolo gy.12 The 1988 to 1994 NHANES  includes  serologic  tests   for   HIV   and   herpes si mplex viruses I and 2 (HSY-I and HSY-2); preliminary results from the HIV tests have been  publis hed,  but  the HSY data have not been published yet.
  National Health  and  Nutrition  Examination  Survey  se­ rie s  is  a  large,  multiyear  population  survey   that  collects a broad battery of medical data, including information on cardiovascular and pulmonary function and nutritional status.13 To collect these data , NHANES used mobile ex­ amination centers that were driven around the country, typically staffed by 16 medical pro fession als, plus addi­ tional in terv ie wer s and administrative staff. Because the survey  was  designed  to  draw  blood,  the  additional   cost of collecting sera for STD or HIV testing  and  testing  the spec i men s was modest. On the other hand, the compre­ hensive nature of the data  collection  meant  that  it  took years to complete the survey , process the specimens, and release the fi nd i ngs. Given the broad topics covered, relatively  scant  relevant  behavioral  or  demographic  data are collected. The 1976 to 1980 survey did not include questions about sexua l behav io r. The 1988 to 1994 inter­ view contained a very limited number of quest ion s about sexual experience and asked whether a doctor had ever diagnosed herpes but did  not  ask  about  condom  use  or STD symptoms. To fully ensure that the HIV data were confidential,  these  samples  were  collected  anonymously and were not linked with the  behavioral  or  other  labora­  tory data.
  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey se­ ries data collection requires an unu ually high level of respondent cooperation. Respondent s, recruited and in­ itially interviewed at home , must then come to the mo­
bile examination site and par tici pate in 31/ 2 hour s of
physical  examination,  including  drawing  blood .  Nonethe­ le ss, the  researchers  have  attained  admirable  response rates. In the  1988  to  1991  component  of  NHANES,  83% of those  selected  to  participate  responded  to  the  inter­ view (we ighted ) and 74% had at least some form of the medical examination.  There  was  a  small,  additional drop-off for blood donation, which had  a  weighted  re­ sponse rate of 67% for those older than I year of age.14

16.4 % of adults ages 15-74 tested positive to herpes simplex virus-2 antibodies. Prevalence was higher among women, blacks, southerners, city dwellers,
lower-income groups and divorced or widowed persons.
Positive test results indicate infection, although the infection may not be clinically symptomatic. Asymptomatic shedding of the virus occurs in a small proportion of people.
0.8% of persons, 12 years of age or older tested positive to syphilis antibodies. Prevalence was higher among blacks, older persons, lower-income groups, city dwellers, and divorced or widowed persons.
Positive test results indicate either current or past (treated) infection.
0.39% of persons 18 to 59 years of age tested from 1988 to 1991 were HIV positive.
Prevalence was higher among men and blacks.

Positive test results indicate that the virus is present.


Serology was tested for a subsample of the total NHANES population. Serum samples were available only for 51% of adults selected, and only 34% of the serum samples were tested (N = 3,416).






Serology was tested for a subsample of those selected for the general interview (N = 12,989).





To ensure confidentiality, specimens for HIV testing were blinded for all data, except age group, race/ethnicity, and county of residence . Of 5,430 unweighted people tested, 29 were HIV positive. A more sophisticated statistical analysis is in preparation.



HSV-2 = herpes simplex virus type 2; HIV= human immunodeficiency virus; NHANES = National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.



Sample  size  was  sometimes   further  reduced   because there was not enough sera  for  some laboratory  analyses. The data from the 1976 to 1980 NHANES are the key source for the often-cited  statistic  that  one  sixth  ( I 6 .4%) of adults  are  infected  with  HSV-2. 9  The  survey  also found that syphilis was much rarer  (0.8 % prevalence  in those 12 years of  age  or  older),  although  it was  much more common among some subpopu lations. 8 Partial data from the early (1988-1991) portion of the I 988 to 1994 survey indicate that 0.39% of the adult  population is in­ fected with HIV, a  level  substantially  lower than  esti­ mates	provided	by    earlier,	indirect	calculations. 10 However, the authors note that the data  do not  include certain high-risk groups, such as the homeless or those
in institutions such as prisons or hospitals.

National Behavioral and Demographic Surve ys Related to Sexuall y Transmitted Diseases
  In the past decade, there has been an increase in the number of  nationally  representativ_e surveys   of adults and youth , focusing on acquired immune deficiency syn­ drome (AIDS) and STD-related behaviors, especially sexual activity and condom use. The interviews typically focus on sexual and condom use behaviors, related atti­ tudes, and other key demographic variables. These are important because sexual activity and condom nonuse

are the proximate causes of STDs, whereas social, psy­ chological, and demographic traits are risk factors for sexual and condom use behaviors. There are also many behavioral and demographic studies of convenience sam­ ples (e.g., college students, patients at family planning clinics) that are not discussed in this article. A pitfall of these surveys is that they do not include data  about  ac­ tual STD status (although some ask about self-reported history of diagnosed STDs). Thus, they do not have clinically meaningful outcome measures of disease status. A further problem is that the self-reported data about sensitive sexual behaviors  are  sometimes  viewed as untrustworthy because of intentional or unjntentional misreporting of behaviors.
  Su rve y Methods. In Table 2, the target populations, survey modes, and response rates for six of the recent nationally representative surveys of  sexual behavior  in the Uruted States are described , including the ational Health and Social Life Survey (NHSLS ),15·16 National AIDS Behavioral Surveys (NABS), 17 18 National  Survey of Men ( SM),19- 22 National Surveys of Farruly Growth (   SFG),23--27  Youth  Risk  Behavior  Surveys  (YRBS), s2 -o3 and ational Surveys of Adolescent Males ( SAM).31  34  Some of these surveys have multiple components  or  waves so that there are more than six actual data collec­ tion efforts represented. All the surveys are nationally representative in scope, although only two (NHSLS and

NABS) encompass  adults  of  both  genders.  The  others have more  specialized  target  populations:  adult  women (NS FG), adult men (NSM), adolescents  (YRBS)  ,  and young  men  (NSAM  ).  Some  of  the  surveys  oversam­ pled  certain  groups,  such  as  minorities  or  persons   liv­ ing in areas with high  AIDS  preva lence  .  Oversampling was performed to ensure adequate sample sizes for subpopulations  of  interest  ;  sample  weights  compensate for this in analysis .  It  is  worth  noting  that  only  two  of the surveys  (  SFG  and  YRBS)  were  directly  adminis­ tered by the federal government. The rest were all inves­ tigator-initiated survey projects, although the federal government was the primary grant-funding source for all except one of the surveys (NHSLS) .
  The most common survey approach has been face-to­ face household interviews with randomly selected re­ spondents conducted on a household basis , with the

most confidential topics covered in brief  self-adminis­ tered questionnaires. The response rates (percent of eligi­ ble respondents who are interviewed)   ranged   from 70% to 83%.  Computer-assisted telephone interview­ ing was used in NABS,  and  the  school-based compo­ nent of YRBS uses self-administered questionnaires completed by students at school. Although they are much less expe  nsive , telephone surveys typically must be shorter  (and thus  cover  fewer  to pics ),  usu­ ally have lower response rates than household sur­ veys, and exclude some groups   (those   without phones). It is not possible to add a urine collection component to a phone surve y, and it would be very difficult to add such a component to  a  school-based survey.

four surveys that concentrate on adults (NHSLS, NABS, NSM, and NSFG) typically  show  that the great  majority of adults are sexually experienced but that the number of sexual partners is fairly conservative (e.g., NHSLS  re­ ports for adults a  median  of  3  partners  since  18  years of age, and NABS reports that 9% had more  than 1 partner in the last 12 months). A small, but nontrivial proportion of adults used  condoms (e.g., in NHSLS, 16% used a condom during last intercourse; in  NSFG, 20% of women reported using condoms). The  NSFG  is the  only  survey that  can be  used  to  examine  changes in adults' condom use since the early 1980s  and  indi­ cates that there have been substantial increases in  con­ dom use since 1982. Because the great majority of

sexual experience was with steady partners (e.g., spouses), the low proportion of condom use was not sur­ prising . However, NABS specifically examined condom use among those with more than  one  partner  in  the last 12 months and reported that only 11% of the national sample used condoms all the time and 38% never used them.
  The behavior of adolescents and young men is differ­ ent. A slight majority of 15- to 19-year-old American adolescents are sexually active. The  NSAM  reports that  an average sexually active male teenager had two female partners in the last year, reflecting the lower stability of relationships among the young . However, young people tend to have relatively higher levels of condom use. In both

304	KU  ET  AL	Sex ua lly Trans mi 1te d Di se ases  May. 1 997

the 1991 YRBS and 1988 NS AM, more than 50%  of youth reported they used  a  condom  the  last  time  they had sex.
  Each of the six surveys has a  number  of  questions about heterosexual behavior and condom use,  but  they vary greatly in the level of data about other factors rele­ vant to STDs. In Table 4, an assessment of the relative depth of data about sexual and prophylactic behaviors in each survey is provided, and those behaviors with specific data about same-gender sex and self-reported STD status are illus trated. The NSFG and YRBS have other areas of inter­ est-women's general fertility experience and the gamut of youth risk behaviors-and have relatively less information about sexual behavior. The other four surveys, which were researcher-ini tiated surveys, have been more focused on sex­ ual and related risk behaviors relevant to STD or HIV risk.
Neither  NSFG or YRBS include questions about homosex­
ual intercourse . The other surveys have asked about same­ gender sex, although the findings have been somewhat discrepant. The NHSLS appears to be the best source of data about same-gender sex and reports that 4.9 % of men and
4.1 % of women have had same-gender sex at  least  once while they were adults. The NSM reported much lower per­ centages of homosexual behavior, but this is probably an un­ derestimate because questions about homosexual behavior were asked in a face-to-face interview and not in a self-ad­ ministered ques tionna ire.
  
In several of the surveys, the respondents also were asked whether they had ever had or had ever  been  told  that  they had an STD. The level of self-reported STDs will underesti­ mate disease prevalence because of undiagnosed infection, poor respondent recall (e.g., inability to remember disease names), and hesitancy to report having a stigmatized disease. The results are divergent: for example, the NSFG estimated that 26% of women ever had gonorrhea, chlamyd ia, or her­ pes, whereas I 0 % of men in NSM reported ever having an STD. It is plausible that much of  the male-female  difference is because of the fact that women have periodic reproductive health examin ations , whereas men do not. Women might also have better recall of their medical histories or be more willing to report STDs than men. The very low prevalence of self-re­ ported STDs in male adolescents in the 1988 NSAM  (1.9%)  is well below  estimated prevalence levels in  adolescents and is probably largely because of undiagnosed STDs.
  Criticisms of the Survey Data. The most important methodological criticisms of the demographic and behav­ ioral surveys concern the validity and reliability of self-re­ ported sexua l, contraceptive, or other risk behaviors (e.g., intravenous drug use) .33 5·36 Many are skeptical about the honesty or accuracy of self-reports about these  sensitive and personal behav io rs. Respondents may have "social desirability bias"; that is, they may be  inclined  to  pro­ vide answers that they believe are more socially accept­ able to the interviewer. Thus, respondents may

underreport stigmatized behaviors, such as homosexual activity or drug injection, or overreport socially favored behaviors, such as condom use.
  Methodological studies of self-reported sexual behaviors have yielded mixed results. For example, Upchurch et al37 found that there was a high degree of concordance  in  re­ ports of sexual behaviors by both members  of a couple. On the other hand, Zenilman et al38 found that self-reports on condom use were essentially uncorrelated with  measured STD incidence, and many people who reported using con­ doms all the time still acquired an STD. It is likely that the validity of self-reported sexual or other risk behaviors is het­ erogeneous: most people are relatively honest and answer to the best of their ability, but a significant minority intention­ ally or unintentionally misreport their behaviors.
  Although it may be difficult to validate individu als' re­ sponses, external data help verify broad trends. For example, increases in self-reported condom use among  young  men from 1979 and 1988 appeared consistent with reports of in­ creasing condom sales in the late l980s,30 and the lack of growth in condom use from 1988 to l 991 also corresponded with sales data.32
  Although there is no clear consensus on  the  extent  of error in self-reports of sexual behavior, it is reasonable to conclude that (I) more sensitive topics are more prone to misreporting  than  less-sensitive  topics,  and  (2)  the   most se nsi tive topics , such as same-gender sex or illegal  drug use, should be asked confidentially by self-administer ed questionnaires that the interviewer is not permitted to view.39 A new method of data collection, the Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI), which permits respondents to either hear questions read to them through headphones or read them on a laptop computer screen and select responses on the com­ puter in a private fashion, has shown promising results as a method of asking about sensitive behaviors..io
  Representative surveys may also underrepresent or exclude cer­ tain high-risk groups. Some socially marginalized populations, such as the homeless, prostitutes, intravenous drug users, and un­ documented aliens, are probably undercounted in most surveys. These marginalized groups may also be more prone to social de­ sirability bias and want to report safer behaviors to appear more " norma l." Because mo st household  surveys  exclude people  in  institutions,  they  may  miss  prisoners  ,  people  in  residential  treatment  programs,  or  hospitalized  pa­ tients. The se  high-risk  groups  may  represent  a  signifi­ cant share of infected persons, particularly those seen  in public clinics.

The Feasibility of Sexually Transmitted Disease Testing in
a Representative Household Survey
  The primary logistical barrier, until recently, in  adding STD testing to nationally representative household  surveys has been that the specimens required for clinical tests gen-

erally required  blood or urethral  swabs. This  meant  that  a data collector had to be a  medical  professional,  such as a nurse or phlebotomist. Although NHANES included a number of medical staff, this is not the norm for most household surveys. In addition, many respondents are hesitant to provide blood or a urethral swab; therefore, participation rates might be low anyway, jeopardizing the validity of the data. The recent advent of PCR and LCR tests for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae have made it feasible to conduct STD tests that have high sensitivity and specificity using first-catch urine specimens. 41 .42 The sim­ plicity of the new specimen collection means that (I) regu­ lar survey interviewers (who are not medically trained) can administer the specimen collection in the field and (2) most respondents should be willing to donate specimens. The new tests have much better performance (i.e., better sensi­ tivity) than prior nonc ulture tests, such as enzyme immu­ noassay or leukocyte esterase tests, greatly reducing the risks of misclassification of infected and uninfected per­ sons. That is, the new tests are not only easier to adminis­ ter , they also yield more valid results.
  Aware of the new diagnosti c tests, in 1994 researchers from the Urban Inst itute , Research Triangle insti tute, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) de­ cided to test the feasibility of adding an STD testing com­ ponent to the 1995 NSAM, which was planned as a behavioral and demographic household interview sur vey. 43 Interviewers would collect the urine samples from the in­ terview respondents and ship them to the CDC for labo­ ratory analyses of C.  trachomatis  (with  eventual plans for testing N. gonorrhoeae). If the pretest proved suc­ cessful (as it did), we would add this component to our full-scale national survey.
  The purposes of the pretest were to determine whether collection of urine specimens was feasible in household surveys and to assess alternative strategies for data  col­ lection protoco ls . Because this  was  a  pretest,  with  lim­ ited resources and time , the sample size  was  relatively  small. and we knew that comparisons of alternative data collection  protocols  would  not  be  statistically   significant at a 95% confidence level. As such, most of the findings reported here should be viewed as tentative.

Methodology
  Sampling  and  Parti cipant  Selection.  The  SAM   pre­ test was focused in three counties in Maryland in the late summer of 1994. Emulating procedures from a full-scale survey,  sampled  addresses  were  statistically   generated from Census data , and trained interviewers screened household s to identify eligible male participants 15 to 25 years of age. Although the original goal was to get 200 respondents,  higher-than-expected  field  costs  meant  that we could interview only I 24 persons, of whom 82 were

306	KU   ET  AL	Sex ua ll y Trans mi tte d Di se ases  May. 1 99 7

eligible to be asked for urine specimens. (The remainder were not asked because they were too young  [younger than I 8 years of age] or in an experimental group  not asked to provide urine at all.)
  Urine collection was limited  to those  I 8  years of age or older. As a matter of policy, NSAM has always re­ quired written parental consent for interviews of minors (those younger than 18 years of age). If we added STD testing for minors , we expected that written parental con­ sent would be needed for the STD tests, and test results possibly would have to be given to parents , which could potentially reduce participation rates and embarrass or harm some minors; therefore, we chose to not  ask  for urine specimens from the minors. In addition, we  ad­ vised those providing urine  specimens  that  they  would be used only for STD tests and would not  be  used  for drug testing . Respondents were offered $ I0.00 to $20.00 to complete the interview and an additional $10.00 to
$20.00 to provide a urine spec ime n. To examine alterna­ tive approaches for obtaining consent, we randomly allo­ cated eligibles into experimental treatments (described in the Results section below).
  An additional informed consent issue  concerned  re­ porting the names of infected  persons  to  state  or  local health departmen ts. It was  plausible  that  this  might  re­ duce willingness to  participate,  particularly  among  high­ risk  persons .  One  of  our  experimental  variations compared persons who were told  that  persons  infected would be reported , and another group promised complete confidentia lity . This was possible because the pretest  site did not mandate C. trachomatis reporting at that time , although most states require it. (Interested readers  may contact the  senior  author  or  their  state  health  depart­ ments for  more  discussion  of  STD  reporting  require­ ments in research studies.)
  All of those tested could call a toll-free telephone number and, after providing identification, learn the status of his or her STD test results. In  addition,  we called anyone who had a positive  test  result , discussed the implications of chlamydia! infection, and urged  them to see a physician for further testing and treatment. Where appropriate, we provided referrals to local clinics that offered free or discount STD treatment services.
  Laboratory Methods . After collection , data collectors labeled the urine specimens with a respondent identifica­ tion code, the date of collection, and the time between specimen donation and last urination. Specimens  were  then packed in ice chests, frozen in home freezers, packed on wet ice, and mailed with overnight delivery to the CDC in Atlanta for laboratory analyses .
  Urine specimens were tested for the presence of C. trachomatis using commercial PCR assays (Amplicor, Roche Diagnostic Systems, Branchburg, NJ) and LCR assays (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Speci-

mens were processed and tested according to the manu­ facturer 's instructions as described  previously,  44 .45  except for the modification  of  freezing  specimens  before  testing by PCR. After arrival  in  the  laboratory,  specimens  were kept at 4°C for no  more  than  48  hours  before  processing by sedimentation and replacement of supernatant with the appropriate urine resuspension buffer provided in the  PCR and LCR kits. Processed  specimens  were  tested  by  PCR and LCR immediately or frozen at -70°C  until  tested,  up to 10 days later. For the purposes of the  pretest  study,  sub­ jects  from  whom  a  specimen  tested  positive  by  either PCR or LCR were considered to be infected.

Results
  Of the 82 persons who consented to be  interviewed, 85% provided a urine specimen  (95 % confidence  inter­ va l, 77% to 93%). The majority of those who were will­ ing to be interviewed would  donate  a  urine  specimen. The relatively low nondonation rate reduces the risk of serious nonresponse bias.
  We included small, randomized, experimental vari­ ations in the informed consent procedures that examined the impact of (I) a one- versus two-stage consent  (asking for the interview and urine specimen all at the same time versus asking for the interview, and only requesting the urine specimen after the interview is completed) and (2) reporting STD versus not reporting STD to state or local health departments. Because of the small sample size, it was not possible to detect significant differences in the groups , but data suggested that a two-stage consent with­ out reporting STD yielded the best combination of inter­ view response rates and urine specimen donation rates .
  To assess nonresponse bias, we examined interview re­ sponses of those who provided urine specimen and those who did not. Again, small samples precluded statistically significant findings, but data suggested that those who provided urine specimens were not substantially different from those who did not. If anything, those who did not provide urine specimens were at lower  risk.  For  exam­ ple, those who donated urine specimens appeared more likely to be sexually experienced. This is consistent with prior research that indicated that survey nonrespondents sometimes have less sexual experience than respon­ dents. 46
  Of those tested, 6% were positive for C. trachomatis. Because of the small and localized  sample,  this  should not be extrapolated to  a  national level.  However,  this rate is consistent with other recent surveys.

Conclusions
  The primary source of national estimates of STD in­ fection has been the communicable disease-reporting

system , which can lead to biased  estimates  because  of the lack of scientific sampling. Although it has been technically possible to collect nationally representative serological data for syphilis since the 1960s, logistical problems and expense rendered this infeasible unless the data collection was just one part of a large battery of medical data collection, as in the NHANES surveys. The new DNA-based PCR and LCR tests of urine specimens help open a new door for scientific research regarding STDs. In addition to the PCR and LCR tests for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae, similar D A amplifica­ tion tests exist (for research use)  for  HIV  and  other STDs.
  The convenience of data collection, stability of speci­ mens, and high sensitivity and specificity make it is pos­ sible for nonmedical data collectors to obtain urine specimens in the field without great difficulty. In our pretest, 85% of the young men who were willing to an­ swer an interview were also willing to provide a urine specimen for STD testing. Based on  this  pretest, we added an STD testing component to the 1995 National Survey of Adolescent Males, and results should be forth­ coming within the next year or so. Although pretest re­ sults suggested that there was relatively low  nondonation of urine specimens, it will be important to more rigor­ ously examine whether those who do not provide speci­ mens differ from those who do.
  Adding urine specimen collection and PCR/LCR test­ ing to a survey is not free. The actual costs would vary, depending on the precise tests used and costs of the laboratory facilities. But the costs for  specimen  collec­ tion and laboratory analyses are small and incremental compared with the basic costs of a nationally repre­ sentative in-person survey. The vast majority of costs are associated with setting up the core interviews, including costs for sampling, for training, and transporting inter­ viewers, screening and contacting respondents, and inter­ viewing them. Again, the specific cost would vary, depending on a number of  factors,  including  the  nature of the population being sampled. Costs and effort are greatly reduced compared with studies such as NHANES.
How  could  integrated  behavioral  and  clinical  data be
used? One key use would be to  provide  statistically based national estimates of the prevalence of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae. But, depending on the content of the interview components of  the  surveys  , many other analyses are possible . First, it will be more feasible to examine the behavioral, demog raphic , and health factors correlated with STD infection, including factors such as number of partners, use of condoms, sub­ stance use, history of STD,  geographic location,  age, race, and educational level. Infection status  can also serve  as a  validity  check  for self-reported  data.  If a per-

son reports no sexual  activity  or 100 % condom  use but  is infected, then the report  appears  questionable.  (It is also possible that people may use condoms I 00 % of the time but become infected because of improper use or breakage.)
  An important factor that cannot be readily determined through survey  research is the infection  status and  infec­ ti vity of prior sexual partners . But it may be possible to obtain data about partners that might serve as risk factors (e.g., partner gender , age, race, where and how this part­ ner was met, whether the partner was a prostitute or drug user , perception of partner 's promiscuity) . These could help us understand more about the sexual networks that promote transmission of STDs.
  Behavioral data, such as attitudes toward sex and con­ dom use, se lf-effic acy, and degree of worry about STD and AIDS , can be used to identify the attitudinal corre­ lates of risky sexual practices and STD infection. Data about prior sex, AIDS, or STD education received by re­ spondents can help us understand the effects of educa­ tional prevention efforts not only  on  risk  behaviors  but on actual STD in fect ions , although they should not be viewed as replacements for  more  rigorous  experiments or field trials of intervention programs .
  Another potential use of integrated  survey  efforts  might be to understand the relation between infection and seeking medical testing or care for STDs. What proportion of those who are infected  have  symptoms?  Those  with  symptoms are most likely to seek care. What proportion of those with symptoms seek medical care? What is the influence of fac­ tors such as type of insu rance,  frequency  of  contact  with the medical system, and education?  What  proportion  of those who are infected have  received  recent  medical  care but still do not know that they are infected? For bacterial STDs, such as C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoe ae, medical treatment with antibiotics is an  integral  step  not  only  to cure the infected person but to prevent  transmission  to fu­ ture partners.
  The ability to integrate behavioral and clinical data also brings new challenges to research. An important  one is the need for collaboration across disciplines, in­ cluding both medical and social science researchers. Clinical researchers would need to understand the spe­ cial challenges of large-scale survey research , and sur­ vey researchers would need to adapt procedures to collect specimens. Together , the researchers will  need to learn how to modify surve y methods to optimize rates of participation for both interviews and  speci­ mens and how to address ethical issues to safeguard respondents' health and confidentiality. The fact that infection for some STDs is uncommon also means that sample sizes will need to be considered carefully. For example, in the 1988 to 1991 NHANES HIV  tests, only 29 positive cases were found among 5,430 per-

sons tested, making subgroup analysis problem atic . Al­ though the new DNA amplification tests  perform  much better than prior nonculture tests, they do not have 100% sensitivity and specificity. Because representative surveys would have low prevalence rates, the potential of misclassi­ fication owing to false-positive results grows more  serious and further increases the need for adequate sample sizes.47
  The new technologies and recent interest in large-scale na­ tionally representative surveys of sexual behavior offer new possibilities to integrate clinical and behavioral survey re­ search about STD and to use probability-based representative samples. We believe that our pretest and subsequent use of urine-based STD testing in the full national survey dem­ onstrate that these  efforts  are  feasible  and  can  become more widely adopted.
