Because of changes in factor replacement therapy and in treatment of human immuno-
deficiency virus (HIV) infection, we examined death record data for persons with hemo-
philia A in the United States to evaluate effects of HIV infection on age and causes of
death. Multiple cause-of-death data from 1968 through 1998 were examined to assess
death rates for persons with hemophilia A. ICD-9 coded causes of death from 1979
through 1998 were examined to assess long-term trends. From 1979 through 1998, 4,781
deaths among persons with hemophilia A were reported, of which 2,254 (47%) had HIV-
related disease listed as a cause of death. In the late 1980s, mortality among persons with
hemophilia A increased markedly, and the age-adjusted death rate peaked at 1.5 per
1,000,000 population in 1992. Median age at death decreased from 55 years in 1979­1982
to 40.5 years in 1987­1990, and increased to 46 years in 1995­1998. In the period 1995­
1998, the median age of hemophilia A decedents with HIV-related disease was 33 years,
compared to 72 years for those without HIV-related disease; the most frequently listed
causes of death for those without HIV-related disease were hemorrhagic and circulatory
phenomena; the most frequently listed for those with HIV-related disease were diseases
of liver and the respiratory system. From 1995 to 1998, hemophilia A-associated deaths
decreased by 41%, with a 78% decrease among those who had HIV-related disease.
Although HIV infection has adversely effected mortality for persons with hemophilia A,
the marked recent decrease in the death rate among persons with hemophilia A appears
to reflect advances in care for those with HIV-related disease and is consistent with a
decline in HIV mortality observed in the general population. Am. J. Hematol. 66:229­240,

INTRODUCTION
Hemophilia A, the clinical manifestation of a congen-
ital deficiency of procoagulant activity of the antihemo-
philic factor (AHF), factor VIII, is characterized by ex-
cess mortality and a markedly lower-than-normal mean
age at death [1,2]. In 1992, researchers found that DNA
inversion within the X chromosome was responsible for
half of the most serious cases of hemophilia A [3]. In
1998, the U.S. population-based estimate of age-adjusted
prevalence of hemophilia A was 10.5 cases per 10,000
males, with an overall estimated national population of
13,321 persons with hemophilia A [4].
In 1964, Dr. Judith Pool observed that a precipitate
that formed after slowly thawing frozen plasma was
enriched in factor VIII coagulant activity [5]; this cryo-
precipitate was subsequently introduced to treat hemor-
rhages associated with hemophilia A. Purified, lyophi-
lized (freeze-dried) preparations of factor VIII became

commercially available in the early 1970s, and by the late
1970s were available for all persons with hemophilia in
the United States [6]. By 1982, 73% of persons with
hemophilia A treated at U.S. hemophilia treatment cen-
ters received lyophilized concentrates, with the majority
receiving their therapy almost exclusively at home [7].
Home infusion enabled earlier treatment of hemorrhages
and markedly reduced their severity. During the late
1970s and early 1980s, the availability of effective treat-
ment with factor concentrates resulted in improved
school and work attendance and decreases in hospitaliza-
tion for persons with hemophilia A. In addition, the me-
dian age at death increased from 45 years in 1975 to a
peak of 65 in 1983 [8,9].
The first U.S. case of AIDS in a person with hemo-
philia A was diagnosed retrospectively as having oc-
curred in January 1981. By the end of 1982, there were
concerns that some transfused factor VIII preparations
may have transmitted the causative agent of AIDS, later
found to be HIV [10,11]. In 1984, it was determined that
HIV in factor VIII preparations could be inactivated by
heat treatment, but by then, the majority of HIV infec-
tions in persons with hemophilia A had already occurred
[12].
By the end of 1999, 733,374 AIDS cases among per-
sons in the United States had been reported to CDC by
state and local health departments [13]. Of these, 5,075
cases had been reported among persons with hemophilia
A or other bleeding disorders, most of whom had been
exposed through contaminated blood transfusions before
the widespread use of heat-treated factor concentrates
began in 1985 [13]. An evaluation of national mortality
data for deaths among persons with hemophilia A
through 1989 showed that the AIDS epidemic had re-
versed the trends toward improved health for persons
with hemophilia A, resulting in a markedly increasing
death rate and decreasing median age at death [8]. More-
over, the percentage of deaths associated with HIV in-
fection in this population had come to exceed those due
to circulatory and hemorrhagic phenomena. Because of
recent developments in antiviral treatment for HIV in-
fection, in prophylaxis and treatment of opportunistic in-
fections, and in preparation of factor concentrates, we
again analyzed national mortality data to determine the
effects of HIV infection and of changes in treatment
modalities on longevity and causes of death among per-
sons with hemophilia A.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In the United States, every death must be reported to
state authorities on a prescribed form which includes
designations for immediate, underlying, and contributory
causes of death. Multiple cause-of-death data for the
United States from 1968 to 1998 were obtained from the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [14]. The
most recent year for which multiple cause-of-death data
are now available is 1998. Cause-of-death classifications
were based on the Revision of the Eighth International
Classification of Diseases (ICD-8) for deaths occurring
during 1968­1978 and the Ninth Revision of the Inter-
national Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) for those oc-
curring during 1979­1998 [14­18]. Hemophilia A deaths
were defined as those in which any condition included in
code 286.0 (hemophilia: antihemophilic globulin defi-
ciency, factor VIII deficiency, hemophilia [familial] [he-
reditary], or hemophilia A, for ICD-8; and congenital
factor VIII disorder: antihemophilic globulin deficiency,
factor VIII [functional] deficiency, hemophilia, hemo-
philia A, classical hemophilia, familial hemophilia, he-
reditary hemophilia, or subhemophilia, for ICD-9) was
listed anywhere on the death record. For the years 1979­
1998, HIV-related deaths were defined as those in which
codes 042.0­044.9 (HIV infection), 136.3 (pneumocys-
tosis), 279.1 (deficiency of cell-mediated immunity),
279.3 (unspecified immunity deficiency), 279.9 (un-
specified disorder of immune mechanism), or 795.8
(positive serological or viral culture findings for HIV)
were listed anywhere on the death record. It should be
noted that specific codes for HIV infection (042.0­044.9)
were not used for mortality coding until 1987 [14­16].
To examine long-term trends, age-adjusted and unad-
justed annual death rates were calculated for the years
1968 through 1998 as the number of hemophilia A deaths
per million persons, based on estimates of the U.S. popu-
lation [19]. Because adjusting for age resulted in small
differences in death rates by gender and race, we used
age-adjusted death rates in this study; crude and age-
adjusted death rates did not differ by year. Age-adjusted
rates were standardized by the direct method, using the
1990 census population [20]. Median age at death by
year for persons with hemophilia A was also determined.
Because of differences between ICD-8 and ICD-9 codes,
all other analyses were restricted to death records using
ICD-9 coding, i.e., deaths from 1979 through 1998. We
calculated age-adjusted and age-specific risk ratios
(RRs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using Pois-
son regression analysis [21]. To examine age differences
in death rates, we used 10-year age groups from 0 to 69
years of age and 70+ years. Median age at death in as-
sociation with hemophilia A was determined for each
4-year period (1979­1982, 1987­1990, and 1995­1998).
The ages at death for all persons with hemophilia A were
compared by time period using the Wilcoxon rank-sum
test [22].
To examine racial differences and trends, we used race
categories as provided in the national mortality data:
white, black, and other races, with the latter including
American Indian, Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific Is-
lander, and all other races. Geographic comparisons were
230 Chorba et al.
analyzed by standard U.S. census regions: Northeast,
Midwest, West, and South.
To describe changes in causes of death among persons
with hemophilia A, we examined the causes of death by
broad disease categories, comparing the three 4-year pe-
riods described above. Other studies have noted under-
reporting of HIV infection or AIDS on death records,
possibly due to improper completion of death records,
reluctance to include HIV infection or AIDS on death
records, inclusion of causes of death unrelated to HIV,
incomplete recognition of underlying diseases [23,24], or
variations in terminology for certain disease categories
[25]. To maximize identification of HIV-related death
records, we aggregated disease categories based on mul-
tiple causes of death listed on death records (Table I)
We also compared the characteristics of deceased per-
sons with hemophilia A who did or did not have HIV-
related disease listed on death records during 1995
through 1998. Characteristics examined included sex,
age, race, geographic region, and other causes of death.
The ages at death for hemophilia A decedents with and
without HIV-related disease for the 1995­1998 time pe-
riod were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test
[23].
RESULTS
Overall Trends
In the United States, age-adjusted death rates for per-
sons with hemophilia A reported in the national multiple
cause-of-death data decreased from 0.5 to 0.4 per 1 mil-
lion population from 1968 through 1978, increased from
0.4 to 1.5 per 1 million population from 1979 through
1992, but then decreased to 0.8 per 1 million population
from 1992 through 1998 (Fig. 1). During the 20-year
period for which ICD-9 coded death data are available,
1979­1998, 4,781 hemophilia A-associated deaths were
reported in the national multiple cause-of-death data; of
these, 2,254 (71%) had HIV-related disease listed as a
cause of death (Fig. 2). Demographic analyses of
changes for the periods 1979­1982, 1987­1990, and
1995­1998 are presented in Table II. The median age at
death of persons with hemophilia A decreased from a
high of 55 years (50.6 mean) in 1979­1982, to 40.5 years
(44.0 mean) in 1987­1990, and then increased to 46
years (50.8 mean) in 1995­1998 (1979­1982 vs. 1995­
1998, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1). During the last 4 years for
which death data are available, the total number of he-
mophilia A-associated deaths decreased 40%, from 374
in 1995, to 286 in 1996, to 223 in 1997, and to 221 in
1998; of these, the number who had HIV-related disease
decreased 78%, from 234 in 1995, to 132 in 1996, to 80
in 1997, and to 71 in 1998.
Gender Differences
The annual hemophilia A age-adjusted death rate for
males has been markedly higher than that for females,
reflecting the inheritance pattern of congenital factor
VIII deficiency and the rarity of occurrence of sponta-
neous factor VIII inhibitors in females, which may be
coded in death data as hemophilia A. For males and
females, the death rates significantly increased from
1979­1982 to 1987­1990 (Table II). From 1987­1990 to
1995­1998, the death rate decreased for males but in-

creased for females (Table II). A disproportionate in-
crease in deaths among females recorded as having he-
mophilia A was observed from 1987­1990 to 1995­
1998. Of the 157 deaths reported among females with
hemophilia A during 1995­1998, only 4 had HIV-related
disease listed as a cause of death.
Other Demographic Considerations
In all racial groups, hemophilia A age-adjusted death
rates increased from 1979­1982 to 1987­1990 (Table II);
from 1987­1990 to 1995­1998, hemophilia A death rates
continued to increase among blacks but decreased sig-
nificantly among whites. All age groups except the

youngest (0­9 years) had significant increases in mortal-
ity from 1979­1982 to 1987­1990. From 1987­1990 to
1995­1998, mortality increased significantly in the 70+
age group and decreased significantly in all other age
groups except 20­29. During 1995­1998, the highest
rates of death were observed in the 70+ age group. Al-
though the largest relative increases in mortality from
1979­1982 to 1995­1998 were observed in the 10­19,
20­29, and 30­39 age groups, the largest relative in-
crease in mortality from 1987­1990 to 1995­1998 was in
the 70+ age group.
Analyses by geographic regions showed increases in
the hemophilia A death rate for all regions from 1979­
1982 to 1987­1990 and fairly uniform decreases for all
regions from 1987­1990 to 1995­1998 (Table II). Com-
parisons of age at death for each time period demon-
strated a general shift to lower age at death from 1979­
1982 to 1987­1990, with the exception of a profound
decrease in percent of deaths among those under 10 years
of age, and a dramatic increase in percent of deaths from
1987­1990 to 1995­1998 among those 70+ years of age
(Fig. 3).
During 1995­1998, HIV-related disease was listed as a
cause in the majority of hemophilia A deaths among
persons 10­49 years of age; for persons with hemophilia
A, 88% of deaths among those with HIV-related disease
were in persons 10­49 years of age, as compared with
only 20% of deaths among those without HIV-related
disease (Table III). During the period 1995­1998, the
proportion of hemophilia A decedents with HIV-related
disease to those without HIV-related disease was higher
for males than for females and was highest for persons in
the West.
Causes of Death
Among persons with hemophilia A who died during
1995­1998, the leading diseases or conditions that con-
tributed to death (as categorized in Materials and Meth-
ods) were HIV-related disease; diseases of the circula-
tory system; hemorrhage; endocrine, nutritional and
metabolic diseases; diseases of the respiratory system;
and noncongenital, intrinsic liver diseases (Table IV).
The numbers of deaths by disease category for the lead-
ing causes of death listed for each period are shown in
Figure 4; leading causes of death were analyzed sepa-
rately for those with and without HIV-related disease as
a cause of death (Fig. 5). Overall, from 1979 through
1998, hemophilia A was listed as the sole cause of death
for only 58 persons, 23 of whom died during 1995­1998.
Although the total number of deaths associated with
hemorrhage or diseases of the circulatory system in-
creased from 1979­1982 to 1995­1998, the percentages
of deaths associated with these causes decreased during
this period from 43.2% to 22.6% for circulatory diseases;

Hemophilia A Deaths 233
these changes are the result of the marked increases in
deaths associated with HIV infection (Fig. 2). For the 106
persons with hemophilia A who died in 1995­1998 with
infections other than pneumocytosis or HIV listed as a
cause of death and without HIV-related disease (as de-
fined above) listed on the death record, 54 (51%) had
septicemia (ICD-9 code 038 with streptococcal, staphy-
lococcal, Gram-negative, or unspecified recorded), 45
(43%) had non-A, non-B (ICD-9 codes 070.4­070.5), or
unspecified viral hepatitis (ICD-9 codes 070.6­070.9), 7
(7%) had hepatitis B (ICD-9 codes 070.2­070.3), and 9
(9%) had another infection commonly associated with
but not diagnostic of HIV infection (thus, in the analyses
presented, these patients and those similarly described
below were not included as having HIV-related disease):
3 had mycobacterial infections, 2 had progressive multi-
focal leukoencephalopathy, 1 had disseminated candidi-
asis,1 had cryptococcosis, 1 had an unspecified mycotic
infection, and 1 had an unspecified viral infection. By
comparison, during 1979­1982, only 30 persons with
hemophilia A died with infections other than HIV or
pneumocystosis listed as a cause of death and without
HIV-related disease listed on the death record: 16 had
septicemia, 5 had non-A, non-B viral hepatitis, 5 had
hepatitis B, 1 had hepatitis A (ICD-9 code 070.1), and 5
(16%) had other infections commonly associated with
but not diagnostic of HIV infection: 2 had tuberculosis, 1
had cryptococcosis, 1 had listeriosis, and 1 had blasto-
mycosis.
Of the 517 persons with hemophilia A with HIV-
related disease who died in 1995­1998, 342 (66%) had
HIV infection, pneumocystosis, or cell-mediated or un-
specified immunity deficiency listed as the underlying
cause of death. Also among these 517, 82 (16%) had viral
hepatitis listed as a cause of death, of whom 77 (15% of
517) had non-A, non-B hepatitis. By comparison, of the
587 persons with hemophilia A without HIV-related dis-
ease who died during this period, only 51 (9%) had viral
hepatitis listed as a cause of death, of whom 46 (8% of
587) had non-A, non-B hepatitis. Among hemophilia A
decedents during this period, those with HIV-related dis-
ease had a significantly higher incidence of non-A,
non-B hepatitis-associated mortality compared to those
without HIV-related disease (RR  1.9 [95% CI  1.4­
3.0]).
Comparisons of deaths occurring during 1995­1998
among persons with hemophilia A for whom HIV-related

median age at death was 30 years (41.6 mean) in 1979­
1982 and 34 years (35.6 mean) in 1987­1990; for those
without HIV-related disease, the median age at death was
55 years (50.7 mean) in 1979­1982 and 58 years (54.8
mean) in 1987­1990.
When deaths by disease category listed for each period
were examined, HIV-related disease, hemorrhage, dis-
eases of the circulatory system, and diseases of the re-
spiratory system were the most frequent causes of death
overall, with HIV surpassing hemorrhage as the leading
cause of death by the 1987­1990 time period (Fig. 4).
Comparisons between those with HIV-related disease
and those without HIV-related disease showed a marked
difference in the distribution of other causes of death. For
those without HIV-related disease, hemorrhagic and cir-
culatory phenomena remained the most frequent causes
of death, whereas for those with HIV-related disease,
intrinsic liver disease and respiratory disease were the
most frequent causes of death after HIV-related disease
itself (Fig. 5).
DISCUSSION
Increases in Death Rates
The analyses presented here show that, from 1979­
1982 to 1987­1990, hemophilia A-associated death rates
for the United States increased in all age groups except
the very young (0­9-year-olds). These increases were
most marked among those with HIV infection. In con-
trast, from 1987­1990 to 1995­1998, mortality increased
significantly in the 70+ age group and decreased signifi-
cantly in all other age groups except 20­29. Among de-
cedents with hemophilia A, those with HIV-related dis-
ease have been dying at significantly younger ages and
those without HIV-related disease dying at progressively
older ages. However, when we analyzed multiple-cause-
of-death data rather than only immediate- or underlying-
cause-of-death data, we noted a 41% decrease in hemo-
philia A-associated deaths from 1995 to 1998, in large
part attributable to a decrease in deaths among persons
with hemophilia A who had HIV-related disease. Al-
though no data regarding the use of antiviral therapy are
available on death certificates, the decrease in deaths
among persons with hemophilia A is consistent with ob-
servations of overall decreasing deaths due to HIV in-
fection in the United States in 1996 [26], 1997 [27], and
1998 [13]. The decrease observed in hemophilia A-
associated deaths from 1995 through 1998 cannot be ex-
plained by a reduction in the numbers of the U.S. popu-
lation with hemophilia A, as such estimates were fairly
constant in the 3 years prior to this observed decrease
[28].
Limitations of Death Data Analyses
In any study of mortality there are limitations of po-
tential incorrect diagnoses or errors in death record
preparation [29,30]. The numbers of HIV-related deaths
indicated on death records likely represent conservative
estimates, since possible HIV-related causes of death
may be listed on the death record without expressly iden-
tifying HIV infection [8]. For example, in our study,
there were many deaths with nonspecific infectious pro-
cesses commonly associated with HIV infection, such as
septicemia, listed as the cause of death. Of the 106 per-
sons with hemophilia A who died during 1995­1998
with infections other than pneumocystosis or HIV listed
as a cause of death and without HIV-related disease, 9
(9%) had mycobacterial, mycotic, or other infections that
are now commonly associated with HIV. From 1979­
1982 to 1995­1998, a 3-fold increase was also observed
in hemophilia A deaths due to septicemia, a phenomenon
suggestive of HIV infection that has also been observed
both among intravenous drug users who are at high risk
for HIV infection [24] as well as among the general

population [31]. Unfortunately, one cannot assess the im-
pact of HIV infection by severity of hemophilia A using
standardized death records. However, it is likely that the
greatest impact of HIV infection has been on those with
severe hemophilia A, since this group would be the major
users of factor VIII concentrates compared to those with
mild or moderate hemophilia A [8,32].
Continuing Importance of Hemorrhagic
Phenomena
The spread of HIV-1 infection in persons with hemo-
philia A in the United States has markedly altered mor-
tality statistics for this population. In the 1960s and
1970s, the introduction of factor replacement therapy, the
development of comprehensive hemophilia treatment
centers, and the implementation of home care for this
population decreased the number and proportion of
deaths due to hemorrhage [7], dramatically increasing
their median age at death [33,34]. In this study, these
perturbations are underscored by the disparity in the me-
dian age at death in 1995­1998 for persons with hemo-
philia A between those with HIV-related disease (33
years) and those without HIV-related disease (72 years).
However, some of this disparity may reflect a greater
representation in the latter group of persons with milder
bleeding disorders who thus had a lesser need for factor
replacement. Based on death certificate data, the median
age at death for persons with hemophilia A without HIV
infection--72 years--now approximates the overall life
expectancy for U.S. males [35].
In the analyses presented here, it should be noted that
among persons with hemophilia A without HIV-related
disease, hemorrhagic phenomena remain a leading cause
of death. In our analyses, the incidence of hemorrhagic
phenomena as a leading cause of death may be higher
than in other reported analyses because the analyses pre-
sented here were not limited to immediate and/or under-
lying causes of death but rather included all reported
diseases or conditions that contributed to death.
Deaths Among Females
A disproportionate increase in deaths from 1987­1990
to 1995­1998 among females with hemophilia A was
observed but was not associated with HIV infection. This
increase probably reflects the increasing recognition and
diagnosis of other causes of hemorrhagic phenomena as-
sociated with lack of factor VIII activity, as in those with
variants of von Willebrand disease, carriers of hemo-
philia who have low levels of factor VIII, persons with

circulating anticoagulants, and those with acquired factor
VIII inhibitors such as occur in the postpartum period
[36,37], all of which may be improperly recorded in
death data as ICD-9 code 286.0--congenital factor VIII
disorder--and may account for the large numbers of
females described on death records as having hemo-
philia A.
Age Factors
Among very young persons with hemophilia A, a de-
crease in the number of deaths observed across the time
periods examined may reflect (a) the widespread avail-
ability of HIV-free factor concentrates; (b) incubation
period considerations, e.g., estimates of the median in-
cubation period for persons seroconverting between the
ages of 16 and 24 years exceed 15 years [38]; and (c)
improvements in survival as the result of earlier diagno-
sis of HIV infection and improvements in therapies for
both HIV infection and hemophilia [26,39]. For practical
purposes in the United States, HIV infection among he-
mophilia patients born after 1985 is non-existent [40];
above age 15, HIV seroprevalence increases by age co-
hort [41,42]. With increasing age at seroconversion, the
incidence of AIDS-defining illnesses increases [43­45]
and survival decreases [46,47], indicating a negative ef-
fect of age on tolerance to HIV infection.
Impact of Hepatitis
The spread of HIV-1 infection has diverted the atten-
tion of clinicians from another pair of sequelae of hemo-
philia treatment, i.e., chronic hepatitis and progressive
liver disease [48,49]. Most recipients of non-heat-treated
plasma-derived factor concentrates have been infected
with HBV [50] and HCV [40,51]. At least 50% of those
infected with HCV get chronic hepatitis, and many even-
tually get cirrhosis [52]. Although HIV was eliminated in
the United States from clotting-factor concentrates by
1985, inactivation processes and donor screening proce-
dures were not sufficiently effective to eliminate the risk
of HCV from blood products used by hemophilia patients
until 1990. In the data presented here, the total number of
persons with hemophilia A who had intrinsic liver dis-
ease listed as a cause of death increased 3-fold from
1979­1982 to 1995­1998; the greatest numbers contrib-
uting to this increase also have HIV-related disease. This
may, in part, reflect the sequelae of exposures to HBV
and HCV, as well as other non-A, non-B hepatitis agents
[53,54]. Levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase and
HCV RNA are much higher among multitransfused per-
sons with hemophilia A who are HIV-positive than
among those who are HIV-negative, suggesting that HIV
infection promotes increased HCV replication [55]. In
the analyses presented here, there was a significantly
greater incidence of non-A, non-B viral hepatitis among
hemophilia A patients who had HIV-related disease com-
pared to those without HIV-related disease, although this
may reflect common sources of exposure for both HIV
and HCV. Fortunately, the widespread use of human re-
combinant DNA-derived antihemophilic factor (factor
VIII) in the treatment of hemophilia A has obviated much
of the concerns of new hepatitis infections in current
treatment, as neither HBV nor HCV is present in recom-
binant products.
Antivirals and Prophylaxis and Treatment of
Opportunistic Infections
Treatment with zidovudine (Retrovir, formerly azido-
thymidine [AZT]) and prophylaxis against Pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia have been widely used for HIV-
infected hemophilia patients since 1989 [56]. In HIV-
infected populations in general, decreases since 1990
have been documented in the incidence of P. carinii
pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex, cryptococ-
cosis, herpes simplex disease, and toxoplasmosis, likely
reflecting the increasing use of preventive therapy to re-
duce the development of these opportunistic infections
[57,58]. For several years, early treatment with antiret-
roviral therapy [59­61] and prophylaxis against P. cari-
nii pneumonia [62] have been known to prolong survival
and the time until AIDS-defining illnesses develop. The
clinical picture and subsequent survival of persons with
HIV infection [56,63­65] have improved even more in
recent years with combination therapy using two, three,
or more antiretrovirals (including other nucleoside ana-
log reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) [65], protease
inhibitors [66,67], and non-nucleoside RTIs [68]) that
inhibit the constitutive enzymes of HIV and slow or pre-
vent replication of HIV in vivo [39,69,70].
CONCLUSION
As more cases of HIV infection are managed with
revised treatment guidelines that include the use of anti-
retrovirals before AIDS-defining illnesses or other symp-
toms of HIV-infection develop [39], decreases in HIV-
related deaths, such as the decreases presented here, will
likely continue [71]. Further gains in longevity can be
anticipated from increased utilization of hemophilia
treatment centers, where there is growing expertise both
in therapy for HIV infection and in treating and prevent-
ing the hemorrhagic phenomena of hemophilia [34].
