Enhance Cognitive Performance?

Abstract
The literature on sexual selection and the social brain hypothesis suggest that human cognition and communication evolved, in
part, for the purpose of displaying desirable cognitive abilities to potential mates. An evolutionary approach to social cognition
implies that proximate mating motives may lead people to display desirable mental traits. In signaling such traits, one can increase
the likelihood of attracting a potential mate. Two experiments demonstrated that exposure to mating cues--highly attractive
opposite-sex faces--led people to display enhancements in declarative memory--a process underlying a variety of abilities such as
resource acquisition, intelligence, and creativity. Experiment 1 showed that men (but not women) displayed enhanced memory
for details of a story that was presented during exposure to highly attractive opposite-sex faces. Experiment 2 demonstrated that
heightened displays of declarative memory reflect an enhancement in retrieval rather than in encoding. Findings contribute to the
literatures on human mating and cognitive performance and provide novel insight into links between social processes and basic
cognition.

The fact that highly attractive members of the opposite sex can
make people lose all their mental faculties is nearly a comedic
clich´
e. Imagine a young, male college student walking to class,
when a beautiful woman approaches him to ask for directions.
Many people could likely relate if this young man, when faced
with the attractive woman, was to suddenly forget the way to
the cafeteria. Indeed, Karremans, Verwijmeren, Pronk, and
Reitsma (2009) demonstrated that interacting with attractive
members of the opposite sex can distract and impair cognitive
performance. Their work fits the image of a bumbling young
man trying to explain directions to a beautiful stranger.
Yet, demonstrating desirable mental traits, such as a robust
memory, would be helpful for attracting a mate. Consequently,
an evolutionary approach might predict that mating cues would
motivate individuals to signal their desirability as a mate by
displaying strong mental traits. The current work tests the
hypothesis that exposure to attractive members of the opposite
sex will lead people to display enhancements in memory.
Theories of sexual selection suggest that people seek quali-
ties in mates that signal reproductively beneficial traits. For
instance, people place a premium on physical traits such as
symmetry (Thornhill & Gangestad, 1994) and facial masculi-
nity in men (Fink & Penton-Voak, 2002) because those traits
can signal high genetic quality. In addition to physical traits,
people seek desirable mental traits such as intelligence, crea-
tivity, and sense of humor (Buss, 1989; Li, Bailey, Kenrick, &
Linsenmeier, 2002; Marlowe, 2004; Miller, 2000; Prokosch,
Coss, Scheib, & Blozis, 2009). That women place a higher
value on traits such as being ``educated, cultured, and intelli-
gent'' during times of high conception risk lends further cre-
dence to the notion that preference for these traits is, at least to
some extent, driven by mating-related goals (Beaulieu &
Havens, 2015). Relative to physical traits, desirable mental

traits are not as easily observed, and thus perceivers rely on
behavioral displays to identify their presence. Consequently,
when people are interested in acquiring a mate, they are often
motivated to display desirable mental traits. For example, Gris-
kevicius, Cialdini, and Kenrick (2006) found that the activation
of mating goals increased displays of creativity.
These social displays are often taxing, mentally or physi-
cally, to the party attempting to attract a mate. The theory of
costly signaling states that (1) a reliable signal must be expen-
sive and burdensome for the sender to indicate the honesty of
the signal to the receiver and (2) that there must be a rational
connection between the signal and the message for the receiver
to easily decipher (Connelly, Certo, Ireland, & Reutzel, 2011;
Zahavi & Zahavi, 1997). Indeed, it has been suggested that the
human desire to assess levels of key mental fitness indicators
such as intelligence, creativity, language, and humor in poten-
tial mates has led to the development of signals to be used in
mating contexts that display these advanced abilities
(McKeown, 2013).
Unlike creativity and a good sense of humor, memory does
not often spring immediately to mind when considering traits to
look for in a mate. However, consider the popularity of trivia
game shows and local trivia quizzes. Those games depend on
contestants' ability to display memory of a wide variety of facts
and successful displays of memory confer prizes and social
status. Traits such as general intelligence and ability to obtain
valuable resources are known to be important (particularly
when selecting a long-term mate) and are directly related to
memory. Indeed, there is empirical support for the notion that
individual differences in intelligence and resource acquisition
are dependent on memory. For example, a meta-analysis of the
cognitive abilities that influence general intelligence scores
revealed that memory is a significant predictor (Grubb &
McDaniel, 2000). Furthermore, success at obtaining resources
in the wild and achieving educational goals relevant to career
success depends on memory (Fagan, Holland, & Wheeler,
2007; Reser, 2009; Sherry & Schacter, 1987).Thus, not only
does memory directly aid in one's survival but displays of
one's memory would also be useful for signaling an array of
reproductively beneficial abilities to potential mates.
Declarative memory, dealing primarily with facts and
events of the physical world, involves the ability to declare
or discuss information with other people (Tulving & Marko-
witsch, 1998). By comparison, other types of memory (e.g.,
implicit memory) involve an individual's private experience.
The social nature of declarative memory makes it valuable for
testing the proposed model of memory displays as a signaling
mechanism. Furthermore, since declarative memory involves
statements of fact that can be independently verified by third
parties, it can function as an honest, or at least, costly signal
(Zahavi & Zahavi, 1997). In the current investigation, we pre-
dicted that exposure to mating cues would lead participants to
display increases in declarative memory.
In addition to this hypothesis, we considered the possibility
that there might be relatively greater effects among men than
women. First, mental qualities are especially important to
people who are seeking long-term partners (Buss, 1989; Miller,
2000) and women are relatively more inclined than men to seek
long-term relationships (Buss & Schmitt, 1993). Second, rela-
tive to men, women tend to place greater priority on desirable
mental (as opposed to physical) traits when seeking partners
(e.g., Li et al., 2002). Thus, signaling desirable mental traits
might be especially useful for men seeking female partners,
although we do not rule out the possibility that women may
also show enhancements in the display of mental traits as a way
of attracting men.
To test our hypotheses, we conducted two experiments in
which participants were exposed to mating primes and listened
to information they were later asked to recall. We predicted that
mating primes would lead to displays of enhanced memory,
perhaps especially among men.
Study 1
Method
Fifty-eight psychology students (30 women) participated for
course credit (age ranged from 18 to 28 years). Participants
were randomly assigned to view 10 opposite-sex faces that
were prerated (7-point scale) as either highly attractive
(M ¼ 6.16) or average in attractiveness (M ¼ 2.55). Previous
studies demonstrate that highly attractive faces can prime mat-
ing motives (Baker & Maner, 2008; Wilson & Daly, 2004).
While viewing the faces, participants listened via headphones
to a male voice reciting a spoken account of two people who
spend a day completing errands and engaging in social inter-
actions. Participants were instructed to pay attention to both the
story and the faces and were told that they might be asked to
remember either later on. This instruction was provided in
order to prevent participants from closing their eyes in order
to focus solely on the details of the story, which would have
prevented exposure to the facial stimuli. Ten faces were pre-
sented for 7 s each, spanning the 70 s duration of the audio
presentation of the story. Finally, participants answered six
questions designed to test their memory for the details of the
story (e.g., ``Where did the characters go before they went to
the hardware store?''). Correct answers were summed with
higher scores indicating better memory performance.

Sex Â Condition interaction, F(1, 54) ¼ 4.60, p ¼ .04, Z2 ¼
.08. In order to probe this interaction, the responses of men and
women in the two facial attractiveness conditions were ana-
lyzed separately using post hoc t-tests. A Levene's test for
Equality of Variances suggested that equal variances should
not be assumed for female participants in the two conditions
(F ¼ 8.70, p < .01); therefore, the more conservative version of
this test is reported. This was not the case for male participants.
Although memory performance of female participants did not
vary by condition, t(23.5) ¼ À.66, p ¼ .51, d ¼ .24, there was
an effect of the facial stimuli among men, such that men who
viewed attractive female faces while listening to the story
remembered more details than men who viewed average faces,
t(26) ¼ 2.40, p ¼ .02, d ¼ .91.
Findings from Study 1 are consistent with the hypothesis
that mating cues enhanced memory performance, and this
effect was observed in men but not women. However, the
relatively low mean for men in the control condition of Study
1 creates some interpretational ambiguity such that it is unclear
whether the observed main effect was driven by the enhance-
ment of memory among men who viewed the attractive faces or
an impairment of memory among men who viewed the
average-looking faces. Moreover, the results leave open the
possibility that effects were driven merely by increases in arou-
sal, as opposed to mating motives. Thus, Study 2 provided a
replication experiment and directly assessed the potential role
of arousal.
Finally, because the story was presented at the same time as
the stimuli, the design of Study 1 leaves open the possibility
that mating cues increased encoding, in addition to or instead of
retrieval. Indeed, it is reasonable to assert that encoding
enhancement might convey similar benefits to retrieval
enhancement, given that successful retrieval is, to some extent,
dependent upon successful encoding. However, we argue that
although encoding and retrieval are not completely indepen-
dent, neither are they homologous, as one can fail to retrieve
information that was successfully encoded. Another important
distinction between encoding and retrieval that is relevant to
the current signaling hypothesis is the different functional
value of these processes. Retrieval is a process through which
people can directly communicate to others their knowledge and
intelligence, thus serving as an honest signal of mental traits
that would be desired by a potential mate. Encoding, on the
other hand, is an early stage mechanism that can signal mental
prowess only via more downstream processes (i.e., those that
communicate the information that was encoded). In other
words, encoding success is private and can only function as a
signal via retrieval. Thus, compared with retrieval, one might
expect that encoding would not be as readily affected by expo-
sure to mating cues. Furthermore, consider that if information
is successfully encoded, then this stored information may or
may not contribute to mating-related signaling at an unknown
later time, whereas retrieval immediately following exposure to
mating primes would be much more likely to function as a
display of desirable traits. We therefore argue that retrieval,
due to its greater degree of functional value and relevance to
self-presentation, is likely to have been subject to greater selec-
tion pressure than encoding. Study 2 addresses the uncertainty
of whether mating cues affect encoding, retrieval, or both pro-
cesses by varying the time at which exposure to mating cues
occurred.
Study 2
Method
Two hundred and twenty-eight psychology students (123
women) participated for course credit (age ranged from 18 to
39 years). Participants viewed the same opposite-sex faces and
listened to the same story as in Study 1. However, the order of
presentation was altered to isolate retrieval as the stage of
processing affected by mating cues. Participants were exposed
to stimuli in one of three orders. In the ``encoding enhance-
ment'' condition, participants viewed attractive faces immedi-
ately followed by an audio presentation of the story, then
viewed average-looking faces, and finally completed a test of
their memory for the details of the story. Thus, in the encoding
enhancement condition, the mating cues (attractive faces) were
perceived immediately prior to encoding, which was intended
to activate mating motives during the encoding stage. In the
``retrieval enhancement'' condition, participants viewed
average-looking faces, listened to the story, then viewed attrac-
tive faces, and finally completed a test of their memory for the
story. Thus, in the retrieval enhancement condition, the mating
cues were perceived immediately prior to retrieval so that mat-
ing motives would be active during retrieval. Participants in a
``no enhancement'' condition viewed average-looking faces
prior to both the story and the memory test. Although

average-looking, opposite sex individuals might be viewed as
potential mates, exposure to average faces does not prime mat-
ing motives as strongly as exposure to images of highly attrac-
tive faces (Baker & Maner, 2008). The audio presentation of
the story in Study 1 occurred simultaneously with the presenta-
tion of the facial stimuli, thus dividing participants' attention
between visual and auditory stimuli. Since the facial stimuli in
Study 2 were presented prior to and following the story, parti-
cipants were asked to view seven emotionally neutral images
chosen from the International Affective Picture System (Lang,
Bradley, & Cuthbert, 1997) while they listened to the story. In
order to keep the task as similar as possible between Study 1
and Study 2, participants were instructed to pay attention to
both the pictures and the story. Memory performance was again
measured by summing accurate responses to six questions
about the story. Participants also completed the Brief Mood
Introspection Scale (BMIS, Mayer & Gaschke, 1988), a widely
used 16-item scale that provides measures of arousal (e.g.,
``lively'') and positive mood valence (e.g., ``content'') that
have been shown to have factor validity and Cronbach's a
reliabilities ranging from .76 to .83. The BMIS was presented
immediately following the presentation of the attractive faces
in the encoding enhancement and retrieval enhancement con-
ditions and following the second presentation of average-
looking faces in the no enhancement condition.
Results and Discussion
Descriptive statistics are provided in Table 2. Nineteen parti-
cipants indicated during debriefing that they had participated in
Study 1; their data were excluded from analysis. An omnibus
3 (encoding enhancement vs. retrieval enhancement vs. con-
trol) Â 2 (participant sex) analysis of covariance with the BMIS
subscales of arousal and pleasant mood included as covariates
revealed a main effect of condition, F(2, 201) ¼ 6.68, p < .05,
Z2 ¼ .03, but no interaction between condition and participant
sex, F(2, 201) ¼ 1.59, p ¼ .21, Z2 ¼ .016, and no effects of
arousal, F(1, 201) ¼ .01, p ¼ .93, Z2 < .001, or mood, F(1, 201)
¼ 2.79, p ¼ .26, Z2 ¼ .006. A planned comparison confirmed
that participants who viewed attractive faces prior to retrieval
remembered significantly more details than participants in the
other two conditions, F(1, 203) ¼ 5.83, p < .05, Z2 ¼ .03.
Consistent with Study 1, this effect was larger in men
(Z2 ¼ .062) than in women (Z2 ¼ .007), although the interac-
tion with participant sex was not significant.
These results indicate that exposure to mating cues
enhanced retrieval rather than encoding, and this effect
occurred independent of any effects of arousal or mood.
Furthermore, although the interaction with participant sex was
not significant, there was some indication that the effect was
relatively stronger in men than in women (consistent with the
findings of Study 1).
General Discussion
Because memory is essential for resource acquisition and other
survival skills, a central aspect of human intellectual perfor-
mance, and is associated with a variety of other desirable men-
tal traits, a display of robust memory can serve as an honest
signal of one's possession of an array of reproductively bene-
ficial traits. The current studies found that memory displays
were enhanced by exposure to mating cues and these effects
were not due to mood or arousal. These findings are consistent
with the hypothesis that mating primes would motivate people
to display desirable mental abilities. Study 2 demonstrated that
this enhancement was specific to retrieval, rather than encod-
ing, fitting with the idea that enhancements in declarative
memory serve a social signaling function.
We observed some evidence that effects of mating cues on
memory displays were relatively stronger in men than women,
although the strength of this evidence was inconsistent across
studies. A sex difference would fit with previous work demon-
strating that, compared with men, women tend to place rela-
tively greater weight on the mental traits of prospective
partners (Buss & Schmitt, 1993); thus, men may reap particular
benefits from signaling desirable mental attributes like good
memory.
One possible explanation for inconsistent evidence for sex
difference might lie in the way the primes were presented.
Griskevicius et al. (2006) found that men's creativity was
enhanced when primed with either a short-term or a long-
term mating goal, whereas women's creativity was enhanced
only when primed with a long-term goal. The attractive faces
we used are likely to have primed a short-term mating goal, as
physical attractiveness is a trait sought primarily in short-term
partners (Li & Kenrick, 2006). Nevertheless, attractive long-
term partners are also preferred over unattractive ones, and,
thus, the primes in the current experiments may also have
primed long-term mating goals. Because the primes did not
clearly differentiate between cues relevant to short-term versus
long-term mating, this may have weakened our ability to detect
sex differences.
Nevertheless, findings from both studies provide novel evi-
dence that exposure to mating cues can lead to displays of
enhanced memory. If we had found that images of attractive
opposite-sex targets had hindered successful memory displays,
some might have dismissed this finding as intuitively obvious.
After all, several studies show that attractive members of the
opposite sex powerfully capture attention and thus should be

mance by Priming Condition and Sex.

No enhancement (n ¼ 78) 3.68 (1.53) 3.35 (1.55)
Note. Higher numbers indicate better memory performance. That average
performance was worse across participants and conditions in Study 1 com-
pared to Study 2 is likely due to the fact that the mating-related stimuli and the
story were presented simultaneously in Study 1, thus dividing participants'
attention.

highly distracting (Maner et al., 2003; Maner, Gailliot, Rouby,
& Miller, 2007).
The distracting nature of potential mates is consistent with
Karremans et al. (2009) who reported that the presence of an
attractive opposite sex experimenter caused men to perform
more slowly on a test of cognitive performance. The dependent
variable used by Karremans and colleagues reflected a measure
of response time. It is possible that their findings partially
reflected greater effort by participants. A desire to display
mental acuity, for example, could have slowed performance;
such speed-accuracy trade-offs are well documented in the
literature (Dutilh, Wagenmakers, Visser, & van der Maas,
2011). Thus, one possibility is that mating cues may have
motivated participants to display desirable mental traits by
prioritizing accuracy over speed.
Another important contrast is that, unlike the Karremans
et al. (2009) studies, the current studies did not require a
face-to-face interaction. Such an interaction would require a
greater degree of impression management, which can deplete
cognitive resources (Vohs, Baumeister, & Ciarocco, 2005).
Indeed, Karremans and colleagues found cognitive perfor-
mance was negatively correlated with participants' self-
reported levels of self-presentation during an interaction with
a member of the opposite sex. A strength of the current work is
that by exposing participants to mating cues via images rather
than an interaction, we were presumably able to avoid tapping
into impression management and more directly test the effect
of mating cues on cognitive displays.
Nonetheless, impression management is likely an important
component in a real-world mating context. The increased cog-
nitive burden of impression management (like that present in
Karremans and colleagues' experimental paradigm) would
make cognitive displays, such as memory displays, all that
much more difficult to fake in an interaction. This fits with the
idea that displays of mental traits are honest signals that can
demonstrate to potential mates that one possesses reproduc-
tively beneficial traits. Given this, the findings of Karremans
et al. (2009) study may complement the current work by sup-
porting the premise that successful displays of mental traits are
an honest, costly signal of reproductively beneficial traits.
Thus, the current studies extend the literature on human mating
by providing a more nuanced understanding of how exposure to
mating cues impacts displays of cognitive performance. This
research also supplements the literature on cognitive perfor-
mance by identifying a key social variable with the capacity
to upregulate people's memory displays.
Additional avenues for future studies are suggested by lim-
itations of our research. For example, because the current work
relied upon samples of undergraduate students, who may be
especially active in their pursuit of mating interests, it may
have provided particularly optimal conditions for testing our
hypothesis. Future research would benefit from examining
mating-related cognition in more demographically varied
samples.
In addition, the current studies operationalized declarative
memory as retrieval of details from a spoken story and one that
included only male actors. Future studies would benefit from
assessing whether these findings generalize to other stimuli and
other measures of declarative memory. Moreover, in light of
work suggesting disjunctions between different cognitive pro-
cesses (e.g., strongly remembering someone despite a lack of
attention; Becker et al., 2010), future investigations would ben-
efit from understanding whether similar disjunctions character-
ize the effects of mating cues on cognitive performance. One
possibility is that while mating cues enhance declarative mem-
ory, they might initially narrow people's attention, as the pres-
ence of a potential mate might distract attention from
peripheral aspects of the situation (Maner et al., 2007).
An additional factor that could be included in research that
seeks to extend the findings of the current work is the role of
hormonal fluctuations in memory displays (and memory per-
formance more broadly). Although the current work did not
evaluate where female participants were in their menstrual
cycles, it has been established that these fluctuations can influ-
ence memory performance (e.g., attention and memory have
been shown to be worse at ovulation compared to the luteal
phase; Hartley, Lyons, & Dunne, 1987; Soli
´s-Ortiz & Corsi-
Cabrera, 2008). Future studies may track ovulation in an
attempt to determine whether hormonal fluctuations have any
effect on declarative memory.
Finally, it is unclear whether the current research primed
short- or long-term mating mind-sets. Although there is con-
siderable overlap between the traits desired in these two con-
texts, there are also important differences (Buss, 1989; Li et al.,
2002). This should have implications for the specific charac-
teristics people signal in these contexts. Future research should
examine potential differences between the effects of long- and
short-term mating cues on the display of desirable traits.
Although intuition might suggest that exposure to highly
attractive people would be distracting and would impair cog-
nitive performance, a functionalist perspective suggests that
mating goals might lead people to display desirable mental
traits. Because memory is a foundational cognitive process that
is linked to important survival skills (such as resource acquisi-
tion) as well as desired mental attributes including intelligence,
displaying a robust memory would signal a variety of repro-
ductively beneficial characteristics. It is also possible that the
memory enhancement following exposure to mating primes
that was demonstrated in the current study functions in the
service of more downstream processes such as use of humor
and generation of creative displays, which play a more direct
role in mate attraction. This work provides new insight into
fundamental links between social processes and human cogni-
tive performance.
