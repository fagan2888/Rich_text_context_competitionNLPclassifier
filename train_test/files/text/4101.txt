Introduction
This article is an analysis of law enforcement identified cases
of human trafficking in Rhode Island from 2009 to 2013. It
gives a summary overview of the Rhode Island cases and com-
pares them with U.S. national statistics on human trafficking.
The analysis in this article uses only law enforcement
identified cases, making the findings about human traffick-
ing operations precisely focused on legally defined human
trafficking (Wilson & Dalton, 2008). Several key findings
emerged from the analysis of the seven human trafficking
cases. These findings reveal insights into human trafficking
perpetrators and human trafficking operations. They include
(a) the outcome of a federal criminal case of forced labor in
which a new anti-trafficking statute was used, and the out-
come of a civil suit involving the same case; (b) an analysis
of the online prostitution advertisements, including how vic-
tims were marketed to sex buyers using their ethnicity and
how sex buyers of certain ages and class standing were
attracted by the advertisements; and (c) how victims' moth-
ers were involved in finding their daughters and making
reports to the police that resulted in the arrests of the traffick-
ers. This later finding introduces a previously undocumented
phenomenon that calls for more research.
Method
The federal and state anti-human trafficking laws provide
definitions of human trafficking that can be used for research
as well as prosecution of traffickers. For many years,
researchers had to rely on their own definitions of trafficking
or make their own evaluations about whether the research
populations met the criteria of human trafficking victims or
perpetrators. This analysis relies on legal definitions of
human trafficking and law enforcement identified cases.
Definition of Crimes in Cases in This Analysis
The cases used in this analysis are based on violations of fed-
eral and state anti-human trafficking and trafficking-related
laws. The federal anti-human trafficking law, the Trafficking
Victims Protection Act of 2000, defines a severe form of
human trafficking as the recruitment, harboring, transporta-
tion, provision, or obtaining of a person for one of three pur-
poses: (a) labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or
coercion for the purposes of subjection to involuntary servi-
tude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery; (b) a commercial sex
act, through use of force, fraud, or coercion; or (c) a commer-
cial sex act if the person is under 18 years of age (Trafficking

Analysis of Human Trafficking Cases in
Rhode Island, 2009-2013
Faith Skodmin1, Rachel Dunham2, and Donna M. Hughes2
Abstract
This article is an analysis of law enforcement identified cases of human trafficking in Rhode Island from 2009 to 2013.
Information was collected from police and court records, prosecutors' press releases, and reports in the media. During
this period, there was one case of forced labor of a domestic worker and six cases of domestic sex trafficking. Many of the
characteristics of the Rhode Island cases were consistent with other human trafficking cases in the United States. Discussions
of key findings include (a) outcomes of a criminal case using a new human trafficking statute on fraud in foreign contracting
and a civil suit, (b) how online prostitution ads are used to market victims to sex buyers using ethnicity of the victims and
age and social standing of the sex buyers, and (c) how mothers of victims are involved in locating their daughters and making
reports to the police that initiated investigations.

2 SAGE Open
Victims Protection Act, 2000). The federal statute used in
charges in the cases in this analysis is 18 U.S.C. 1591 Sex
Trafficking of a Child or by Force, Fraud or Coercion.
Another federal law that is closely related to the anti-traf-
ficking law that is frequently used in federal prosecutions,
but does not require proof of force, fraud, or coercion, is a
"transportation offense." This crime (18 U.S.C. 2421
Transportation for Illegal Sexual Activity and Related
Crimes) is defined as knowingly transporting a person for the
purpose of prostitution or any illegal sexual activity.
The third federal charge in the cases used in this analysis is
Fraud in Foreign Contracting (18 U.S.C. 1351). It is defined
as knowingly recruiting, soliciting, or hiring a person outside
the United States for purposes of employment in the United
States by means of false pretenses or promises or fraud.
After the new federal law defined human trafficking
passed in 2000, states in the United States followed with state
anti-human trafficking laws that closely followed the federal
definition of human trafficking. In 2009, Rhode Island passed
a comprehensive human trafficking law: An Act Relating to
Criminal Offenses (2009). It defined trafficking as whoever
knowingly subjects, attempts to subject, or engages in a con-
spiracy to subject another person for forced labor or commer-
cial sexual activity using the following means: (a) causing or
threatening to cause physical harm to any person; (b) physi-
cally restraining or threatening to physically restrain another
person; (c) abusing or threatening to abuse the law or legal
process; (d) knowingly destroying, concealing, removing,
confiscating, or possessing without that person's consent any
actual or purported passport or other immigration document,
or any other actual or purported government identification
document, of another person; or (e) by using intimidation (An
Act Relating to Criminal Offenses, 2009).
The state cases of sex trafficking used in this analysis
involve two statutes: Trafficking of Persons for Forced Labor
or Commercial Sexual Activity (RI 11-67-3) and Sex
Trafficking of Minor (RI 11-67-6).
With established legal definitions and the prosecution of
human trafficking cases, research can be done on precisely
defined victims, traffickers, and trafficking operations.
Sources of Data for This Analysis
A recent report (Surtees, 2014) evaluating the status of
research on human trafficking criticized the state of empiri-
cal knowledge about human trafficking. It claimed that what
was known about the perpetrators and the human trafficking
operations was "rudimentary, fragmentary and relatively
meager." The report attributed this deficiency to many
researchers relying on victim interviews, and using their
accounts to characterize human trafficking. The report rec-
ommends looking for sources beyond victim interviews. In
particular, the report calls for more research on human traf-
ficking operations (Surtees, 2014). This analysis of human
trafficking uses sources other than victims.
This article analyzes law enforcement identified human
trafficking cases in Rhode Island based on police and court
records, prosecutors' press releases, and reports in the
media. The cases are law enforcement confirmed human
trafficking case which are cases in which an arrest was
made, and the offender charged with one of the offenses
listed in the previous section.
Researchers identified cases of human trafficking in Rhode
Island by searching in several places, including annual reports
from the websites of the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Rhode
Island Attorney General's Office, local news media archives
and websites for newspaper articles, and videos related to
arrests, convictions, and sentencing of human traffickers. The
researchers verified the cases with the Rhode Island Attorney
General's Office and the U.S. Attorney's office.
The following primary documents were retrieved from
the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island and
the Superior Court of Rhode Island: statements by police
officers and witnesses about human trafficking crimes,
indictments, plea agreements, and sentencing memoranda.
In addition, press releases from the Rhode Island Attorney
General's Office and the U.S. Attorney's Office were col-
lected. Statements in the press releases often added impor-
tant information about the cases, such as historic precedents
of the cases and the nature of the crimes. Media sources from
newspapers, TV news, and blogs were used when they sup-
plemented the information from the primary sources.
Sometimes media sources were used as a reference when the
information was not available in official documents. An
example of that kind of information is a quote made by law
enforcement at a news conference about an arrest.
Information from multiple sources was combined to cre-
ate a detailed description of each case. Aspects of the cases
were compared and analyzed to find differences and simi-
larities among the cases. The findings from the Rhode Island
cases were then compared with national statistics on human
trafficking cases. Several key findings from the cases are
discussed in detail.
General Characteristics of the Human
Trafficking Cases in Rhode Island
From 2009 until the end of 2013, there were seven cases of
human trafficking in Rhode Island. During this period, there
was one case of forced labor and six cases of sex trafficking.
In many ways, the Rhode Island cases are similar to other
human trafficking cases in the United States. In the words of
Ambassador-at-Large Luis CdeBaca, of the U.S. State
Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in
Persons: "The Rhode Island cases are symbolic of modern
slavery" (Mulvaney, 2011c).According to data from federally
funded human trafficking task forces (2008-2010), 80% of
suspected incidents of human trafficking were sex trafficking,
and 10% of incidents were forced labor (Banks & Kyckelhahn,
2011). The Rhode Island human trafficking cases followed
Skodmin et al. 3
the same pattern, with six of the seven cases being sex traf-
ficking and one case being forced labor.
The one case of forced labor was a case of domestic ser-
vitude. The perpetrator was a foreign national from the
United Arab Emirates. The victim was a foreign national
from the Philippines. The U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted
this case. Following the criminal case, the victim filed a civil
suit against the trafficker.
Cases of Domestic Sex Trafficking
All of the sex trafficking cases were domestic trafficking
cases, meaning the victims were U.S. citizens, and they were
not transported across international borders. This pattern of
victims of sex trafficking being U.S. citizens is consistent
with the findings of the Department of Justice study that
found that 83% of victims of sex trafficking were U.S. citi-
zens (Banks & Kyckelhahn, 2011). Furthermore, two of the
cases were Rhode Island domestic trafficking cases, meaning
both the trafficker and the victims were from Rhode Island
and the victims were exploited in prostitution in the small
state of Rhode Island.
Most of the sex trafficking cases involved interstate trans-
portation of victims. In four of the six cases, traffickers
brought the victims to Rhode Island from Massachusetts,
New York, or Indiana. In one case of interstate transporta-
tion, two traffickers from New York stated that they brought
victims to Rhode Island because of the lack of a law against
prostitution (Milkovits, 2010c). In one sex trafficking case, a
male trafficker traveled with the victims to Rhode Island,
while his female partner remained in Indiana and organized
the advertising of the victims online (Neronha, 2010b).
Victims of Sex Trafficking
A number of the sex trafficking cases involved interstate
transportation of victims. Two of the six cases of sex traffick-
ing involved traffickers bringing minor girls from
Massachusetts to Rhode Island. Law enforcement personnel,
service providers, and researchers have known for a long
time that women and girls are trafficked from Massachusetts
to Rhode Island. Rhode Island strip clubs and other adult
entertainment businesses were attractive places for traffick-
ers to offer their victims to sex buyers because there was no
law against indoor prostitution and no enforcement of exist-
ing sex trafficking laws in Rhode Island before 2009.
In the six cases of sex trafficking, there were eight perpe-
trators and 11 victims identified in the cases. Of the 11 vic-
tims of sex trafficking, all were women or teen girls. There
was a wide age range among the victims. Six of the victims
were minors (under the age of 18) and five of the victims
were adults (age 18 or older). The youngest victim was 14
years old. The oldest victim was 45.
Many service providers, law enforcement personnel, and
researchers have recognized that runaways are frequently
exploited by sex traffickers (Kotrla, 2010; Shared Hope
International, 2009). The Rhode Island cases of sex traffick-
ing fit this pattern. Five out of the six minor victims of sex
trafficking were reported missing by their families or had run
away from group homes. In May 2014, the Rhode Island
Attorney General's Office said that it had a dozen active
cases and was investigating another dozen. An agency that
provides services to victims of trafficking said that it was
assisting20traffickingvictims.TheRhodeIslandDepartment
of Children, Youth and Families said that in the last year
(2013-2014), 20 girls (aged 13-16) have been referred to
them by investigators (Milkovits, 2014c).
The targeting of minor girls, especially girls in the child
welfare system, by traffickers is widely recognized in Rhode
Island by social workers and professionals in the juvenile
justice system. In 2013, the Family Court of Rhode Island
held a conference on sex trafficking of minors titled
"Trafficking, Trauma and Exploitation of Children in the
Child Welfare System."
Some of the sex trafficking cases likely involved addi-
tional perpetrators and victims who were not included in the
official files.According to police records, in one state domes-
tic trafficking case, "detectives have learned that [the accused
trafficker] may have had six or seven young women or teens
working for her, including another 14-year-old and a 16-year-
old girl" (Milkovits, 2014c). In one federal interstate trans-
portation case, the traffickers had two or three additional
women working for them in and around the state of Indiana
(Neronha, 2010a).
Sex Traffickers
Rhode Island sex trafficking cases were consistent with the
national findings on whether traffickers worked alone or
with a team. Of the eight sex traffickers involved in the six
cases, six of them were men, and two were women. Two
cases involved a team of two perpetrators. One of those cases
involved two men working together, another case involved a
man and a woman team. According to the data from federally
funded task forces, 63% of incidents of sex trafficking
involved only one suspect, while 32% of incidents involved
two to five suspects (Kyckelhahn, Beck, & Cohen, 2009).
Prosecution of Sex Trafficking Cases
Most of the cases of sex trafficking were prosecuted by the
state Attorney General's Office. Of the six sex trafficking
cases, four of them were state cases prosecuted by the Rhode
Island Attorney General's Office, and two of them were fed-
eral cases prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office. This dis-
tribution of human trafficking cases between federal and
state agencies is consistent with the findings of the
Department of Justice, which found that state agencies are
more likely to prosecute sex trafficking cases than federal
agencies and federal agencies are more likely to prosecute
4 SAGE Open
forced labor cases (Banks & Kyckelhahn, 2011). In Rhode
Island, although more of the sex trafficking cases have been
prosecuted by the RI Attorney General, the U.S. Attorney's
office has been active in cooperating with local and state law
enforcement on investigating sex trafficking cases. Most of
the cases of human trafficking resulted in convictions. After
prosecutions, seven of the eight sex traffickers were found
guilty, and one case is still pending.
Involvement of Sex Buyers in Sex Trafficking Cases
There were no sex buyers arrested in connection to any of the
sex trafficking cases. In one case involving a 14-year-old
girl, the trafficker had sold the teen 45 to 50 times over a 30-
to 45-day period (Rosciti, 2013a). When a reporter asked the
officer in charge of the investigative services division if they
were going to investigate the men who purchased sex from a
14-year-old victim, he replied that they "were more con-
cerned about the trafficker than the actions of the men
involved" (Angers & Campbell, 2013). This comment raises
concern about law enforcement personnel's lack of interest
in holding sex buyers accountable, as well as their lack of
awareness of the harm that sex buyers do to victims.
Overall, the general pattern and characteristics of the first
human trafficking cases identified in Rhode Island were con-
sistent with findings of other human trafficking cases around
the United States.
In the next sections, some of the key findings of the seven
human trafficking cases will be discussed. Information that
emerged from the analysis of the cases resulted in some
insightful new findings about human trafficking and will
point to new areas of research.
Successful Civil Suit in Forced Labor Case
From 2009 to 2013, there was only one law enforcement
identified forced labor human trafficking case in Rhode
Island. It was the first case of forced labor prosecuted in
Rhode Island in modern history. The actions included a fed-
erally prosecuted criminal case and later a civil suit filed
against the accused trafficker by the victim. The Federal
criminal case and the civil suit had different outcomes.
This forced labor case was the second time that the crime
of fraud in foreign labor contracting (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1351)
was used as it became an actionable offense with the passage
of the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization
Act of 2008 (The William Wilberforce Act). The first suc-
cessful prosecution using this federal law was in 2010, when
multiple defendants were found guilty of a racketeering
enterprise, involving forced labor and fraud in foreign labor
contracting in Missouri. In this case, foreign workers were
recruited under false pretenses and forced to work under
threat doing housekeeping in hotels (U.S. Department of
Justice, Civil Rights Division, 2010; U.S. Department of
Justice, Kansas City Division 2010).
In the Rhode Island case, criminal charges were filed by
the U.S. Attorney's Office in 2011 (United States of America
v. Arif Mohamed Saeed Mohamed Al-Ali, 2011a). The
accused trafficker was a 46-year-old military officer from the
United Arab Emirates, who was attending a program at the
Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, on a student
visa (Ballesteros, 2011).
The accused trafficker brought the Filipina victim to the
United States under a contract that she would care for his
5-year-old son. The domestic worker was supposed to work
40 hr each week, and be paid US$1,600 a month (Ballesteros,
2011). Instead, the accused trafficker forced her to work an
average of 119 hr per week. He and his wife required the
victim to maintain a five-bedroom, three-story home, as well
as care for the accused trafficker's five children, cook three
meals a day for the family, clean the house, launder and iron
all of the family's clothes, take out the trash, wash the cars,
and clean the garage and yard (Ballesteros, 2011).
The accused trafficker and his wife would not allow the
victim to leave the house unless she was accompanied by
someone in the family. He seized her passport and told her
not to run away because with the support of the U.S Navy he
would find her (Ballesteros, 2011). While living in the United
States, the accused trafficker was making US$32,000 a
month (Mulvaney, 2011e). For the first 2½ months of work
that the victim did, the trafficker sent a total of US$410.00 to
her family in the Philippines as compensation for her labor
(Ballesteros, 2011).
Before the criminal trial began, the man and his family
tried to flee the country. They were removed from a plane at
JFK Airport by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement.
His wife and children were allowed to leave the country. The
trafficker was released on a US$100,000 bond and had to
wear a GPS tracker until he stood trial (Minute Entry, 2011a;
Mulvaney, 2011d).
The alleged trafficker elected to have a bench trial, mean-
ing that the judge ruled on the case and not a jury. In the
criminal trial, there were complications resulting from poor
translation of the victim's testimony. The judge dismissed
the victim's original testimony because the court interpreter
used a different dialect than the witness and she admitted to
not translating the victim's testimony verbatim (Minute
Entry, 2011b; News Staff, 2011). This misinterpretation of
testimony led to confusion and conflict between the prosecu-
tor and the defense about whether the victim should be
allowed to testify again. Ultimately, the judge ruled that the
victim could testify again.
At the conclusion of the trial, the judge decided to put more
credence in the defendant's version of events based on his
30-year career in the Navy of the United Arab Emirates and the
prestige of his position at the U.S. Naval War College (Lisi,
2011).Thejudgedeclaredthatthevictim'stestimony"...doesn't
have a ring of truth," and ruled that the accused trafficker was not
guilty (Lisi, 2011; Mulvaney, 2011b; United States of America v.
Arif Mohamed Saeed Mohamed Al-Ali, 2011b).
Skodmin et al. 5
Later, the victim, with the support of the Asian American
Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), filed a civil
suit against the trafficker (Elizabeth Cabitla Ballesteros v.
Arif Mohamed Saeed Mohamed Al-Ali and Samah
Alharmoodi, 2011; I. Suriyopas, personal communication,
April 1, 2015). Three of the charges for violation of civil
rights were related to crimes of trafficking; they are forced
labor, trafficking with respect to peonage, slavery, involun-
tary servitude, or forced labor, and involuntary servitude
(Ballesteros, 2011).
A representative of the AALDEF's Anti-Trafficking
Initiative stated, "Our client was a recent immigrant with little
knowledge of her rights" (Administrator, 2011). The trafficker
took advantage of the victim's unfamiliarity with employment
laws and customs of the United States and used it as a means
to maintain control over the victim and exploit her labor.
The civil suit judge made a different judgment about the
credibility of the victim's testimony than the Federal judge.
He recognized the control the trafficker had over the victim
and the harm done to her. A representative of the AALDEF's
Anti-Trafficking Initiative said,
Ms. Ballesteros finally had the opportunity to give unfettered
testimony in a court of law. The judge said that the victim suffered
"outrageous, illegal, and inhumane conduct" at the hands of the
defendant. Her experience as an immigrant domestic worker is
all too common, and we are committed to helping her recover
and seek justice. (Sehgal, 2012)
In contrast to the criminal court judge, who did not believe
the victim was credible, the civil court judge did believe she
was credible. The civil suit judge stated,
This court, after hearing [the victim's] testimony, and observing
her demeanor on the witness stand, determines that [the victim]
was a highly credible witness . . . her testimony about the
conditions of her employment and her treatment at the hands of
the accused trafficker was compelling and believable. (Elizabeth
Cabitla Ballesteros v. Arif Mohamed Saeed Mohamed Al-Ali and
Samah Alharmoodi, 2012)
The accused trafficker was ordered to pay the victim 1.2
million dollars in civil damages (Elizabeth Cabitla Ballesteros
v. Arif Mohamed Saeed Mohamed Al-Ali and Samah
Alharmoodi, 2012). According to the AALDEF's representa-
tive, as of spring 2015, the accused trafficker has not paid the
victim any of the 1.2 million dollars in damages. He fled the
country and left behind no assets that could be confiscated (I.
Suriyopas, personal communication, April 1, 2015).
To date, there have been no summary reports about civil
suits for human trafficking in the United States. A recent
report by Levy and Vandenberg (2014) described the "fail-
ure" of criminal cases to obtain legally required restitution,
although forced labor cases were more successful than sex
trafficking cases. Between 2009 and 2012, the authors found
that restitution was awarded in just 36% of the cases, and the
amounts awarded were called "paltry" (Levy & Vandenberg,
2014). It is not known how much of the court ordered restitu-
tion is actually paid to the victims.
At this point, the outcomes of the criminal and civil cases
on forced labor human trafficking in Rhode Island cannot be
put in a national context. However, the difference in findings
in the criminal case and the civil suit point to areas of interest
for future research.
The First Case of Sex Trafficking
In 2010, one year after the passage of the Rhode Island
human trafficking law, the first State case of human traffick-
ing was identified. Two 23-year-old men from Yonkers, New
York, were charged using the 2009 human trafficking law
(Rhode Island Code § 11-67-3; State of Rhode Island v.
Joseph Defeis, 2011b; State of Rhode Island v. Andy
Fakhoury, 2011b).
The men brought women from their home neighborhood
in Yonkers, New York, to Rhode Island in 2008 because, at
that time, there was no law against indoor prostitution
(Kilmartin, 2011). They pretended to be "gangsters" by giv-
ing themselves the street nicknames of "Kash" and "Jemz,"
and made rap music videos of themselves driving around
Providence in a black SUV, flashing fistfuls of US$100 bills.
In one video, they filmed a woman dancing on a stripper pole
and rapped: "I keep a couple of hoes from around my way,"
referring to the women they recruited from their neighbor-
hood in New York (Milkovits, 2011).
The two men recruited the victims through deception. One
man promised a 19-year-old victim love, friendship, and a
waitressing job (Mulvaney, 2011c).According to theAssistant
Attorney General, the men "preyed upon [the victims'] vul-
nerabilities" (Mulvaney, 2011c).
The Providence Police initiated an investigation into the
sex trafficking operation following a tip from police in
Yonkers, New York, that a 19-year-old woman was being
forced to engage in commercial sex acts (Milkovits, 2010a;
Ruggiero, 2010). Police set up a sting operation, in which a
law enforcement officer posed as a sex buyer by calling an
online prostitution advertisement known to be associated
with the victim. He arranged to meet the victim at an apart-
ment. Upon his arrival, the traffickers were arrested and the
victims were rescued (Ruggiero, 2010).
After being arrested and charged with sex trafficking,
both perpetrators pleaded guilty to Trafficking of Persons for
Forced Labor or Commercial Sexual Activity [RI 11-67-3]
(Department of the Attorney General of the State of Rhode
Island, 2011; State of Rhode Island v. Andy Fakhoury, 2011;
State of Rhode Island v. Joseph DeFeis, 2011a). The Rhode
Island Attorney General described the senior partner in the
trafficking operation as ". . . a manipulative, violent, danger-
ous predator who has little regard for basic human rights"
(Kilmartin, 2011, press release). This man was sentenced to
the maximum 20 years with 10 years to serve and 10 years
6 SAGE Open
suspended with probation (Department of the Attorney
General of the State of Rhode Island, 2011; State of Rhode
Island v. Andy Fakhoury, 2011). The second man was sen-
tenced to 10 years with 1 year to serve and 9 years suspended
with probation (State of Rhode Island v. Joseph DeFeis,
2011a). Restitution was granted to one victim for out of
pocket medical bills (State of Rhode Island v. Joseph DeFeis,
2011a). At sentencing, the Superior Court Judge said that
traffickers were guilty of "one of the most despicable crimes
known to mankind." The judge spoke as a Black man and
made a comparison of the crimes of trafficking with slavery:
"You can tell by the color of my skin I differ in complexion
from you . . . People of my skin color, many of them were not
brought here voluntarily . . . What you did in this matter is
nothing less than being a slave owner in the United States of
America" (Mulvaney, 2011a, p. A1).
The first case of sex trafficking in Rhode Island showed
the connection between previously decriminalized indoor
prostitution in Rhode Island and the sex trafficking of vic-
tims to the state. As the first arrests and charge for sex traf-
ficking, the proceedings garnered a lot of media coverage in
the local media. The judge's comment at sentencing clearly
connected the actions of the traffickers to slavery.
Federal Case of Interstate Prostitution
In 2009, a report of an assault at a hotel in Rhode Island led
to a federal investigation into an interstate prostitution opera-
tion that stretched from Indiana to Rhode Island and
Connecticut (Bothelo, 2010; United States of America v.
Nathaniel G. Pope, 2009). The case involved two pimps--a
47-year-old man and a 45-year-old woman--from
Indianapolis, Indiana, who exploited two victims on a road
trip from the Midwest to the Northeast. They ran their inter-
state prostitution operation for about 3 years, and had at least
three additional victims in Indiana (Bothelo, 2010).
The female pimp, known as "Big Mama," recruited an
18-year-old girl from Indiana by befriending her on the
Internet and acting as a friend and confidant (Neronha, 2010a;
United States of America v. Jan Wales, 2010). The second vic-
tim, a 45-year-old woman from Indiana was recruited by the
male pimp in an online "interracial chat room" (Neronha,
2010a). The victim said that she was propositioned to be a
prostitute for the pimp, at which time he "promised her that he
doesn't beat his girls, and promised her that she would be
safe" (Bothelo, 2010).
The male pimp, known as "Rah, Rah," transported the
two victims to New England while the female pimp stayed in
Indiana and ran the administration of the prostitution ring.
She posted online prostitution advertisements and set up
meetings with sex buyers (Neronha, 2011). When the
18-year-old victim did not want to engage in prostitution, the
pimp threatened and assaulted the young woman. He stole
her money, confiscated her cell phone, and abandoned her in
a hotel room in Warwick, Rhode Island (Neronha, 2011).
The male senior partner of the team was arrested and
charged with a violation of federal law Transportation in
Interstate Commerce for Purposes of Prostitution (18 U.S.C.
2421). A few days later, the female junior partner, who had
fled to Arizona, was apprehended (Neronha, 2010a).
Both traffickers pleaded guilty to transporting victims
across state lines for the purpose of prostitution (United States
of America v. Jan M. Wales, 2010b; United States of America
v. Nathan Pope, 2010). During the sentencing process, the
female pimp claimed that she had participated in a "victimless
crime." The United States Attorney said that she had know-
ingly recruited women to engage in commercial sex acts and
played a key role in organizing appointments with sex buyers.
He said, "The defendant was a madam, not a victim" (Neronha,
2010a). "Big Mama," the female pimp, was sentenced to 12
months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release (United
States of America v. Jan M. Wales, 2010a).
During the sentencing process, the senior pimp, "Rah Rah,"
said that his role was misunderstood, he was merely responsi-
ble for "paying bills and getting groceries" in a "happy" home
for wayward prostitutes and their artistic pimp. He too argued
that prostitution was a victimless crime. The U.S. Attorney
responded that "this is not a victimless crime. It is tawdry, dan-
gerous and degrading" (United States of America v. Nathan G.
Pope, 2011). He was sentenced to 24 months in prison, and 3
years of supervised release (United States of America v.
Nathan G. Pope, 2011).
This case was the first federal prosecution of a trafficking-
related crime after Rhode Island passed a law criminalizing
prostitution, which enabled the offense of transportation
across states lines for purpose of prostitution to be charged.
The claim by the defendants that they were engaged in a
"victimless crime" was clearly rejected by the prosecutor and
the evidence in this case demonstrated the violence used
against the victims in this interstate prostitution operation.
Online Advertising of Sex Trafficking
Victims
From the early years of the Internet, traffickers have used
online advertising to market victims to sex buyers (Farley,
Franzblau, & Kennedy, 2014; Hughes, 2001, 2002, 2004;
Mitchell, Jones, Finkelhor, & Wolak, 2011). Sex traffickers'
use of online advertising has enabled them to reach a wider
market of potential sex buyers, which has led to the growth
of prostitution and sex trafficking (Farley et al., 2014;
George, 2012). In addition, sex traffickers utilize social
media on the Internet to contact vulnerable women and teens
and groom them to be victims (George, 2012).
This analysis of sex trafficking cases identified in Rhode
Island between 2009 and 2013 found that sex traffickers
relied heavily on online prostitution advertising sites as a
means to connect with sex buyers. In each of the sex traf-
ficking cases, traffickers paid for advertisements on online
prostitution sites.
Skodmin et al. 7
Disguise of the Victims
The most common element of the advertisements was the
disguise of the victim's age and identity. The traffickers used
fake names and false ages for the victims. The traffickers
concealed their use of minor girls by always claiming they
were above 18 years of age. The minor victims, who were
aged 14 to 17, were advertised as being 19 or older. A
17-year-old victim in a Rhode Island domestic trafficking
case was advertised as being 20 (Rosciti, 2011a). A 14-year-
old victim in a Rhode Island domestic trafficking case was
advertised as being an adult (Milkovits, 2013a; Rosciti,
2013b). A 15-year-old victim in a Massachusetts interstate
trafficking case was advertised as being an adult (Kantorski,
2013). A 17-year-old victim in a Massachusetts interstate
trafficking case was advertised as being 19 (Neronha, 2014).
Sexually Explicit Photos of the Victims
The traffickers often photographed victims in sexually
explicit poses. In one case, a man trafficked a 17-year-old
developmentally delayed victim across state lines. After
being arrested, the trafficker admitted that during his online
conversations with the girl, he knew that there was some-
thing not quite right with her and that she may have some
mental deficiencies (Donaghy, 2013). The trafficker took
photos of her in her underwear standing in a hotel room, then
posted them in an online advertisement (Steimle, 2013). In
another case, the victim stated the trafficker took pictures of
her on a couch when she was in her sister's apartment before
posting them online (Rosciti, 2011a).
Means of Using the Internet in the Trafficking
Operation
Details of the cases revealed how traffickers operate using
the Internet. In an interstate transportation case, a man and a
woman operated as a trafficking team (this case is described
in more detail previously in this article). The female traf-
ficker remained in Indiana and did the online work. She
uploaded prostitution advertisements for the victims and set
up a time and place for her male accomplice to deliver the
victim to the sex buyer (Neronha, 2010b). The man in the
team drove the victim across the Midwest and into the north-
eastern states, including Rhode Island (United States of
America v. Nathan G. Pope and Jan M. Wales, 2010).
After posting ads for the women, the traffickers trans-
ported the victims to meet sex buyers, even when the victims
were old enough to drive (Neronha, 2011). In three of the sex
trafficking cases, the traffickers delivered the victims to the
sex buyers in hotel rooms or apartments. In one case, the
victim was instructed to walk to a nearby empty apartment to
meet a sex buyer (Comella, 2011). In another case, the vic-
tims were kept in an apartment with the two male traffickers
and the sex buyers came to the apartment to use the women
(Ruggiero, 2010). In another case, the sex trafficker took the
teen victim to a strip club where she was used as an exotic
dancer and used by sex buyers in the private booths in the
club (Kantorski, 2013). One female trafficker used online
prostitution advertisements to set up between 45 and 50
meetings with sex buyers for a 14-year-old victim within a
span of 30 to 45 days (Rosciti, 2013a). When the police con-
fronted the 21-year-old trafficker, she said, "That's [victim's
nickname], I knows she's young, I don't do anything, I just
post info and take the calls" (Rosciti, 2013a).
Exploitation of Race and Ethnicity of Victims
In the advertisements, the traffickers exploited the victims'
race and ethnicity. The traffickers used the victims' physical
attributes to market them to sex buyers. For example, there is
a small population of people from the Cape Verde islands in
Rhode Island (Fox Point Cape Verdean Project, n.d.). The
trafficker exploited the 17-year-old Cape Verdean victim's
ethnicity in the prostitution advertisement. "Capverdian [sic]
Paradise $50 Special--Hello, My name is Jessica . . . I am 20
years old and willing to make your night wild . . . hit me up
if u down to handle what I got" (State of Rhode Island v.
Brandon Frails, 2011).
In another case, the trafficker emphasized that the victim
was white with blond hair.
A pretty and petite blond, age nineteen, available all day for
upscale gentlemen looking to spend some time together.
(Ruggiero, 2010)
Traffickers exploiting their victims'ethnicity is not unique
to Rhode Island. In a study of prostitution advertisements in
Las Vegas, ethnicity was specified in 92% of the ads (Farley
et al., 2014). The researcher wrote that the inclusion of race
and ethnicity in the ads reflected their importance to sex
buyers.
Targeted Marketing of Victims
The traffickers also wrote the advertisements to target cer-
tain populations of sex buyers by using slang or different
wording and language style. In some advertisements, the
traffickers marketed the victims to sex buyers of a certain
age and economic background. In two of the advertisements,
the traffickers targeted older, wealthier men. One advertise-
ment requested "upscale gentlemen" (Ruggiero, 2010).
Another trafficker requested that sex buyers be middle-aged
or older "gentlemen." "Sweet girl next door-19. Hey every-
one! I'm the new girl in town. I am your sweet cute girl next
door. So come see me. Older gentlemen only. 45 years of
age and older" (Neronha, 2014).
The advertisements listed prices for the commercial sex
acts. In one case, two traffickers sold the victim for US$150 for
a half hour and US$250 for an hour of oral sex and intercourse
8 SAGE Open
with the victim (Ruggiero, 2010). And, in another case, a male
and female trafficking team sold the victims to sex buyers for
US$250 an hour of sexual intercourse (Neronha, 2010a). And
in the case where the victim was a developmentally delayed
teen, the trafficker negotiated a price with a sex buyer for
US$40.00 and two packs of cigarettes (Donaghy, 2013;
Steimle, 2013).
Law Enforcement's Use of Prostitution
Advertisements in Investigations
In two of the six cases, police used the online advertise-
ments to set up a sting that resulted in the rescue of victims
and the arrest of traffickers. In one case, after a call from a
worried mother, the Yonkers, New York, police identified
the young woman in an online prostitution advertisement.
They contacted Providence Police, who initiated an investi-
gation into the report that a 19-year-old woman was being
forced into prostitution (Mulvaney, 2014). Providence
Police located the online prostitution advertising with a
photo of the victim. A police officer, posing as an under-
cover sex buyer, made an appointment to meet with the vic-
tim (Ruggiero, 2010). The arranged meeting place was at an
apartment in Providence where the victim was being held by
the traffickers (Milkovits, 2010c).
This analysis of online advertisements for victims of sex
trafficking is consistent with findings of other researchers,
law enforcement personnel, and service providers' reports
that online prostitution sites are commonly, even exclusively,
used to market victims of sex trafficking. Recently, the
Massachusetts Attorney General stated that the majority of
sex traffickers in human trafficking cases prosecuted in her
office have used online prostitution advertisements to exploit
the victims (Healey, 2015; Landergan, 2015). Social net-
working sites, advertising websites, message boards, and
dating sites all provide platforms for prostitution marketing
with relative anonymity and impunity (Farley et al., 2014).
Mothers Involved in Recovering Victims
One of the key findings of this analysis of human trafficking
cases in Rhode Island is that family members, particularly
mothers, were often involved in the recovery of their daugh-
ters. In half (three of six) of the sex trafficking cases, mothers
played active, even central, roles in locating their daughters.
Mothers initiated investigations on their own, made police
reports, and even contacted the traffickers in attempts to
recover their daughters.
The analysis of sex trafficking cases in Rhode Island found
that some of the victims were not completely isolated from
their families. Although the traffickers controlled the victims
and limited or monitored their communication, the victims
were still able to communicate with family members. Several
victims in two cases of sex trafficking maintained contact
with their mothers using their cell phones. In these cases, the
victims talked to their mothers but did not communicate
openly with them about all the details of how they were being
trafficked. One crucial piece of information they often did not
reveal to their mothers was their locations.
In the first case of human trafficking prosecuted in the
state of Rhode Island, two men conspired to gain the confi-
dence of at least four victims from their old New York neigh-
borhood (Milkovits, 2010b). The traffickers ensnared the
victims with false promises of love, a job, and a sense of
family. They used the victims' familiarity with them as
neighbors to gain their trust (Milkovits, 2011). In this case,
one mother knew the man who persuaded her daughter to
leave with him, although she did not know that he intended
to exploit her (Milkovits, 2011).
In the same case, one victim told her mother that she was
leaving with the trafficker because he loved her, and he knew
where there was a job for her as a waitress. Soon after the
victim left, she called her mother and said, "Mom, I wish I'd
never come" (Milkovits, 2011). Her mother's suspicion that
her daughter was in danger intensified when, over a period of
months, her phone calls with her daughter were always inter-
rupted. As the mother knew the man her daughter was with,
she tried to contact him repeatedly to find her daughter. On
one occasion, the trafficker answered his phone and told the
victim's mother that he did not know where her daughter was
(Mulvaney, 2011a).
Another mother in the same case was not aware of her
daughter's situation until she received a phone call for help
from her daughter as she hid in a bathroom of the apartment
where she was being held captive (Milkovits, 2014a). The
mother called the police to get help for her daughter. When
police showed up at the apartment, this victim left with the
police. Another victim who was present denied that she was
in danger and stayed at the apartment with the trafficker
(Milkovits, 2014a). She would not be rescued until months
later when her mother contacted local Yonkers Police in New
York for help to locate her daughter (Milkovits, 2011).
As the victimization of teen girls and young women by
traffickers becomes more widely known, more family mem-
bers are turning to online prostitution sites to try to find their
missing daughters. In a Rhode Island domestic trafficking
case, a mother recognized her missing 14-year-old daughter
in a prostitution advertisement. Although the girl kept in
touch with her mother every 2 to 3 days by cell phone, she
never disclosed her location (Milkovits, 2013b). After the
mother recognized her daughter, she called the number on
the advertisement and confronted the trafficker. The traf-
ficker hung up, but her daughter called her back and told her
mother that she loved her. Still, the girl would not reveal her
location. The mother then called the Pawtucket Police, which
led to the victim being rescued, and the trafficker being
arrested (Milkovits, 2013b).
In an interstate transportation case, a trafficker befriended
a 17-year-old girl with a developmental disability online. He
then met her at a public library in Massachusetts and took her
Skodmin et al. 9
with him. When the victim's mother could not find her daugh-
ter, she immediately called the police and reported her as
missing (Hager, 2012). In the library's surveillance video, the
girl was seen leaving with a man (Saladna, 2013). The family
participated in a press conference asking for the return of her
daughter and asked the community to become involved in
finding her. With tears in her eyes the mother pleaded to the
man who abducted her daughter: "Whoever you are could
you please just bring her home to us today. I want her to sleep
in her own bed tonight" (Hager, 2012).As a result of the news
conference and media attention on the abduction of the teen,
the victim was identified by a Rhode Island citizen while she
was with the trafficker on the street (Milkovits, 2014b).
Two victims' mothers spoke at the traffickers' sentencing
hearings about the harm that they did to their daughters. One
mother said, "You manipulated a very trusting young girl.
She trusted you and went with you" (Mulvaney, 2011a). She
continued by stating her daughter had been drugged,
enslaved, and denied food and water (Mulvaney, 2011a).
Another victim's mother addressed the trafficker as she said,
"You will do your time and get out and rebuild your life in no
time, for my daughter it will probably take a lifetime"
(Mulvaney, 2011a).
Although mothers played a significant role in locating and
recovering their daughters, in one case, a family member--a
sister--played a more complicit role in her sister's victimiza-
tion. She knowingly allowed her minor sister, who had run
away from a group home, to have contact with a known pimp
and involve her in prostitution. After the trafficker was
arrested, the sister indicated that she knew the trafficker had
"put her sister to work" (Silva, 2011). In a police statement,
the victim's sister wrote, "I . . . knew that [the trafficker] put
girls on the Internet so he would have money in his pocket
and gas in his car" (Rosciti, 2011b). She claimed that when
she learned the trafficker was selling her sister on the Internet,
she confronted him (Silva, 2011). However, a social worker
from a group home was responsible for contacting the police
and initiating an investigation, which eventually led to the
arrest of the trafficker (Rosciti, 2011a).
One of the most notable findings from this analysis of
cases of human trafficking in Rhode Island is the role that
mothers played in recovering their daughters. The police
acknowledged the significant effort of the mothers.At the end
ofonecase,aSergeantfromtheProvidencePoliceDepartment
commended the mothers for their involvement in the case. He
said the mothers kept looking for their daughters until they
were found: "The mothers never gave up on their daughters"
(Mulvaney, 2011a). The mother's involvement was a key fac-
tor in the discovery of these trafficking cases.
Much of the human trafficking literature discusses how
victims are often runaway girls, who are fleeing abuse at home
or throwaway girls who are no longer wanted by family mem-
bers (Hanna, 2002). The analysis of these Rhode Island cases
raises another possibility, and that is that mothers continue to
look for their missing daughters and even take an active role in
their recovery.
There are anti-trafficking organizations, movies, and
books that emphasize in their names that the victims are
daughters. Examples include, Captive Daughters (http://
www.abolishsexslavery.org/captive-daughters), Somebody's
Daughter (Sher, 2013) and She's Somebody's Daughter
(http://www.shessomebodysdaughter.org/). In England in
1996, a mother, whose daughter was controlled by a pimp
and murdered by a sex buyer, founded an organization called
Coalition for the Removal of Pimping (CROP). The organi-
zation continues today under the name of Parents Against
Child Sexual Exploitation (PACE). PACE offers support to
parents whose children are actively being sexually exploited
by people outside the family, including traffickers.
Before her death, Norma Hotaling, survivor and founder of
SAGE (Standing Against Global Exploitation) in San
Francisco, said she wanted to work on family reunification for
victim/survivors and their families, particularly between moth-
ers and daughters. In her work with victims of prostitution and
sex trafficking, Hotaling had discovered that often mothers still
loved their daughters and were concerned about them, but their
families had become broken, often due to domestic violence or
drug abuse. Hotaling saw the possibility of rebuilding damaged
relationships, and considered that an important way to assist
victims to recover and find stability in their lives.
However, there is no research on the continuing relation-
ship between victims of sex trafficking and their mothers (or
other relatives) after the daughter is under the control of a
trafficker. The analysis for this article introduces this as an
area for future research. Understanding continuing relation-
ships between mothers and their victim daughters could pro-
vide insight into how to break the traumatic bonding that
occurs between perpetrators and victims.
Conclusion
This article is an analysis of law enforcement identified cases
of human trafficking in Rhode Island from 2009 to 2013. It
looked at and evaluated seven cases of human trafficking,
including one case of forced labor of a domestic worker and
six cases of sex trafficking.
Although the number of cases in this analysis is low, sig-
nificant information about human trafficking in Rhode Island
emerged, including several topics for further research.
Overall, the Rhode Island cases were similar to human
trafficking cases in other states in the United States. The
forced labor case involved the trafficking of a foreign
national woman by a foreign national trafficker. The sex traf-
ficking cases were domestic sex trafficking. A few of the
cases involved interstate transportation of victims, and there
were cases that involved sex trafficking within the state of
Rhode Island. The victims were often runaways who were
vulnerable to recruitment by sex traffickers.
Some notable findings that are worthy of further study
emerged from the analysis. In the forced labor human traf-
ficking case, there were different findings in the criminal and
civil cases, which seemed to be a difference in the judges'
10 SAGE Open
opinions on the credibility of the victim. To date, there has
been no analysis of human trafficking civil suits in the United
States. This is an important topic for further study, including
the damages levied and whether the traffickers ever paid the
damages to the victims.
Due to a history of decriminalized prostitution in Rhode
Island, traffickers perceived the state to be tolerant of prosti-
tution and therefore a low-risk destination and environment
for exploitation of victims. More research is needed on the
role that state toleration of prostitution plays in creating a
low-risk environment for sex trafficking.
Although the use of the Internet and prostitution advertis-
ing sites have been researched, this analysis revealed a need
for more detailed analysis of advertisements known to offer
victims of trafficking, including the role race and ethnicity
play in marketing the victims and the cues in the ads for the
type of sex buyers the victims are being marketed to.
Finally, the most previously un-researched topic to emerge
from the analysis was the role that mothers played in locating
their daughters and how their reports to police initiated inves-
tigations. In two of the cases, the mothers contacted the traf-
fickers in an effort to find their daughters. This is an entirely
new area of research for understanding the dynamics of stop-
ping human trafficking.
Overall, this analysis of law enforcement identified cases
of human trafficking in Rhode Island found that these seven
cases were consistent with other cases in the United States.
The detailed analysis of the cases revealed important topics
for further research in this field.
