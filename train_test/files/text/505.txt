Background. Pedometers are more likely than accelerometers to be used in walking interventions and other applica-
tions, including wide spread adoption by lay people. The purpose of this article is to provide older adults' sex-and-age-
specific normative values for accelerometer-determined steps/day, adjusted to a pedometer-based scale.
Methods.The data source was accelerometer data collected over multiple valid days (defined as  10 h/day;
mean 5.8 ± SE 0.1 valid days) from 1,196 60+ year olds participating in the 2005­2006 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey. Accelerometer data were adjusted to a pedometer scale using an established process of censoring
steps counted during those minutes where activity counts totaled <500. Quintile-defined categories of adjusted steps/day
(lowest, below average, average, above average, and highest) for six age groups (60­64, 65­69, 70­74, 75­79, 80­84,
and 85+ years) were computed for the entire sample and separately for each sex. LMSChartmakerPro was used to create
smoothed percentile curves corresponding to the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles.
Results. Men aged 65­69 years defined the highest single category (>9,126 steps/day) and women aged 85+ years of
age defined the lowest single category (<276 steps/day). In general, steps/day tended to decrease within each quintile-
defined category as age increased. Similar patterns were apparent in the more detailed LMSChartmakerPro percentiles.
Conclusions.These data represent the first presentation of a detailed population distribution of normative acceler-
ometer-determined steps/day adjusted to pedometer scaling, an instrument more likely to be used in clinical and public
health applications.

Physical activity is associated with numerous and
profound health benefits throughout the life span (1);
however, practicing a physically active lifestyle is per-
haps even more critical for older adults as they age and
are increasingly threatened with mobility disability (2).
Maintaining and promoting ambulatory activity is of pri-
mary importance (3), and objectively measuring and track-
ing such behavior (eg, as steps/day) is critical to identifying
those at risk, conveying precise and actionable goals, and
evaluating the impact of interventions (4). Sharing objec-
tively determined steps/day can facilitate these processes
by illuminating a clear understanding of how many steps/
day older adults typically accumulate (ie, expected values)
(5,6).
Expected values for older adults' steps/day have been
previously assembled from 28 published studies; mean
pedometer-determined ambulatory activity ranged from
2,015­8,938 steps/day (5). This collection of objectively
monitored older adult studies represents an important ini-
tial attempt to provide the much needed data to facilitate
interpretation of researchers' and practitioners' own data
collections. However, this assemblage of existing published
values can be criticized as a reference source because the
data were pooled from different studies representing differ-
ent populations, sample sizes, measurement protocols, and
instrumentation. True normative data characterize what is
usual in a defined population at a specific point (or period)
in time by employing standardized methods.
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) is a preferred source for U.S. normative
data because it is nationally representative in design and
systematically implemented at frequent time intervals. In
2005­2006, NHANES collected accelerometer-determined
step data as part of its objective physical activity monitoring
strategy. Although a number of articles (7) have been
published with these step data, none have presented a
thorough collation of sex-and-age-specific normative values
representingthecompletedatadistribution.Asaccelerometers
are known to be more sensitive to low force accelerations than
pedometers (8,9) (which are more likely to be used in clinical
U.S. OLDER ADULT REFERENCE DATA 1427
and practical applications), an adjustment is necessary to
make the accelerometer output more representative of what
pedometers are likely to detect. The purpose of this article is
to provide older adults' sex-and-age-specific U.S. normative
values for accelerometer-determined steps/day adjusted to a
pedometer-based scale.
Methods
NHANES Physical Activity Monitor
NHANES physical activity monitor protocols are availa-
ble at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_05_06/
BM.pdf and have been described in detail elsewhere (7).
Briefly, the National Center for Health Statistics ethics
review board approved all NHANES protocols, and all
participants were asked to provide informed consent. The
NHANES is designed to assess the health and nutrition sta-
tus of noninstitutionalized adults and children in the United
States. In the 2005­2006 survey cycle, the ActiGraph
model 7164 accelerometer was used (formerly the CSA/
MTI AM-7164, manufactured by ActiGraph of Ft Walton
Beach, Florida) to assess physical activity, which included
an enumeration of steps taken in addition to the more con-
ventional activity count output. The ActiGraph 7164, which
is no longer distributed by the manufacturer, has been well
described previously (10).
Data Treatment
The SAS macro supplied by the National Cancer Institute
(http://riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/nhanes_pam/) was used
to determine nonwear time (defined as 60 minutes of con-
secutive zero activity counts per minute, allowing minimal
interruptions). Although we did consider using a longer
definition of nonwear (eg, 90 minutes) (11,12), we ulti-
mately chose to remain consistent with previous analyses of
NHANES accelerometer data, which specifically combined
the 60 minutes nonwear definition with a requirement for
at least 10 hours of accelerometer wear time to define a
valid day of data (7). Different wear time algorithms have
their most direct impact on estimates of sedentary time
(13­15), not movement (14,15). Indeed, Choi and cowork-
ers (11) clearly acknowledge that a longer time window
for detecting nonwear in the elderly adult is intended to
"prevent sedentary behaviors from being misclassified as
nonwear" (page 2014). As this analysis of the NHANES
older adults' data does not attempt to estimate sedentary
behavior, but is instead expressly focused on steps/day, the
impact of different wear time algorithms is much less of a
concern. Another, and perhaps more important, reason to
keep with the conventional approach to defining nonwear
is to assure reasonable comparability with future similar
presentations of these NHANES data from children, ado-
lescents, and adults <60 years of age. Using different deci-
sion rules to treat the data across the life span will introduce
artifacts that will most likely impair, or at the very least,
distort interpretation.
Using previously published criteria (16), step counts
were adjusted to better match those that might be obtained
from pedometers. Specifically, in those minutes where
activity counts totaled <500, the corresponding step count
for that minute was set to zero, effectively decreasing the
overall number of steps accumulated each day. A sensitivity
analysis of the effects of using this activity count cut point,
relative to others, has been previously published (17).
Statistical Analysis
Analytic sample.-- Of the 1,359 eligible men and women
60 years of age with physical activity monitor data, we
excluded participants with NHANES-designated unreliable
data (n = 54) or with accelerometers found to be out of cali-
bration upon return (n = 61). We also excluded individuals
who did not have at least one valid day of accelerometer
wear time (n = 48; 10 monitored h/day). The justification
for using a single day as the minimum criteria for valid
wear has been presented elsewhere (16). Thus, the follow-
ing analysis was based on data from 1,196 older adults or
88% of the originally eligible older adult sample.
Descriptive characteristics.--Descriptive characteristics
were calculated using SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute LLC,
Cary, NC) and included sex- and age-decade (60­69, 70­79,
and 80+ years) group-specific age, race/ethnicity (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,
or other), height (cm), body mass (kg), body mass index
(BMI; kg/m2), and percent classified by BMI status as
normal weight (18.5  BMI  24.9
kg/m2), overweight
(25.0  BMI  29.9
kg/m2), or obese (BMI  30.0
kg/m2).
When appropriate, survey procedures were used to account
for the complex, multistage probability design used in
NHANES. Step count values were averaged across all
valid days of accelerometer wear time for each participant.
Pairwise comparisons of accelerometer wear time and
steps/day between sexes were conducted using two-sided
t-tests with 15 df. The level of significance  was set to .05
for all inferential analyses. Quintile-defined categories of
steps/day (lowest, below average, average, above average,
and highest) (18) for six age groups (60­64, 65­69, 70­74,
75­79, 80­84, and 85+ years) were computed for the entire
sample and separately for each sex.
LMS curves.--LMSChartmakerPro (LMS Chartmaker
version 2.54) was used to create smoothed percentile curves
corresponding to the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles
based on the LMS method (19). LMS smoothing is a stand-
ard analytical technique for presenting normative data by sex
and across specific age ranges. It has been used to develop
and present the well-known Centers for Disease Control and
1428 TUDOR-LOCKE ET AL.
Prevention growth charts (20). It has also been used to present
normative data for body fat percentiles (21), physical fitness
(22), and bone densitometry (23). Without a smoothing pro-
cess, the raw dependent variable data present a noisy or jagged
line, with many ups and downs occurring along its age-defined
length. The smoothing process captures and presents the gen-
eralized line, more useful for clinical applications.
The LMS method utilizes a Box­Cox power transforma-
tion, with parameters corresponding to the skewness (L:
Box­Cox power, ), median (M), and coefficient of variation
(S), to normalize the data at each year of age. L, M, and S
are estimated at each age t, and then cubic splines are fitted
by maximum penalized likelihood to create smoothed curves
(L[t], M[t], and S[t]) for each of the parameters. Centile
curves are created using the values of L, M, and S at each age
from the smoothed curves, along with the normal equivalent
deviate.The global fit of the smoothed curves was assessed by
Q statistics for each of the curves (24), implemented within
the software. The extent of smoothing, and curve complex-
ity, increases with the equivalent degrees of freedom for L(t),
M(t), and S(t). These degrees of freedom were chosen to be
as small as possible, while still bringing the Q tests close to
normality, therefore creating a parsimonious model. In order
to avoid artificially creating differences through modeling
procedures, the model was fitted for the entire sample, and
the L, M, and S values chosen for the entire sample were then
applied to each sex separately. All LMS model fitting was
conducted while accounting for NHANES sample weights.
Results
Descriptive characteristics of the analysis sample are dis-
played in Table 1. Mean accelerometer wear time among
the analyzed sample was (M ± SE) 13.9
±
0.1 h/day (95%
CI: 13.6, 14.1) across 5.8
±
0.1 valid days. Men accumu-
lated ~16
min/day more accelerometer wear time than
women (14.0
±
0.1 h/day [13.7, 14.3] vs 13.7
±
0.1 h/day
[13.6, 13.9]; t[15] = 2.55, p = .02). On average, this sam-
ple of U.S. older adults took 4,241±144 steps/day (3,935;
4,548), with men accumulating significantly more steps/
day (4,933
±
131 [4,653; 5,213]) than women (3,702
±
161
[3,358; 4,045]; t[15] = 8.53, p < .0001).
Table 2 presents steps/day ranges across the five quintile-
defined categories by combined age groups for the entire
sample and separately for each sex. Men aged 65­69 years
defined the highest single category (>9,126 steps/day) and
women aged 85+ years of age defined the lowest single
category (<276 steps/day). In general, steps/day tended
to decrease within each quintile-defined category as age
increased. Notable exceptions were the above average and
highest categories, as the fourth quintile of steps/day was
higher in the 65­69 year age group than in the 60­64 year
age group for the entire sample and for each sex separately.
Also, the second and fourth quintiles of steps/day were
higher in the 80­84 year age group than in the 75­79 year
age group in men.
LMS curves of steps/day for each sex are presented in
Figure 1. Normative percentile values of steps/day by
each single-age year for men and women are displayed in
Tables 3 and 4, respectively. LMS derived 20th percentiles
for steps/day were higher than the 1st quintile presented in
Table 2 among men in all cases except 60­64, 78, 79, and
82­84 year olds and among women in all cases except 64,
68, 69, 73, 74, 78, 79, and 84 year olds. LMS derived 80th
percentiles for steps/day were higher than the fourth quin-
tile in Table 2 among men in all cases except 65­69, 73, 74,
and 80­84 year olds and among women in all cases except
65­69, 72­74, 78, 79, 83, and 84 year olds.
Discussion
As noted earlier, the discrepancy between accelerometer
and pedometer-determined steps/day is known (8,9).
The source of this discrepancy has been traced to a

between-instrument difference in sensitivity to low force
accelerations, the accelerometer being more sensitive (25).
For example, the between-instrument difference in steps/
day detected in free-living populations has averaged as
low as ~1,800 steps/day (in a relatively young sample) (26)
to as high as ~8,100 steps/day (in an older adult sample)

(27), suggesting that between-instrument differences are
individualized and that a "one-size-fits-all" correction
factor is crude and therefore inappropriate. The process
of censoring those steps taken at <500 activity counts/
min allows for an individualized adjustment because
each individual will logically accrue a different number
of minutes below this threshold and a variable number of
steps within these designated minutes. When applied to
the NHANES accelerometer data, the resulting average
steps/day estimates are compatible with other surveys
conducted with pedometers (28­30). We have previously
reported a sensitivity analysis of this cut point relative to
other candidates (17). Due to their relative low cost and
technological simplicity, pedometers are more likely than
accelerometers to be used in walking interventions (31)
and other practical applications, including wide spread
adoption by lay people (32). Because the NHANES did not
concurrently collect data with a pedometer, for public health
purposes, we are left to extrapolating normative pedometer-
determined steps/day by systematically adjusting these
nationally representative accelerometer data.
These data confirm the well-known sex- and age-related
differences in steps/day, even in samples restricted to older
adults (5). The data are also generally compatible with pre-
viously published expected values for older adults' pedom-
eter-determined steps/day (5), however, and we do report
lower extreme values. One explanation of this apparent
departure is that none of the previously summarized studies
were based on population samples. Further, lower steps/day
values have been reported for special populations includ-
ing older adults living with chronic disease and/or disability
(33­36). Sick individuals may regularly take <1,000 steps/
day (37). These normative data go beyond simple indicators
of central tendency and instead portray values representing
the complete distribution of expected values.
Obviously, there is no "average" older adult, and so it
is impossible to provide a single average steps/day value
that is fully representative, especially across sex and age
groups. The assembled quintile values (Table 2) and the
more detailed percentile values for steps/day presented in
Tables 3 (men) and 4 (women) by each single-age year
represent the first truly comprehensive normative steps/
day data for older adults. Organized by sex, age, and per-
centile rank, the steps/day values contained in these tables
can serve as important reference values for researchers and
practitioners engaged in screening, surveillance, evaluation,
planning, and tracking activities. For example, researchers
may refer to these tables to identify specific percentile val-
ues that may be appropriate for intervention recruiting pur-
poses. As another example of apparent utility, the Lifestyle
Interventions For Elderly study is an important multicenter
randomized control trial designed to evaluate the impact of
long-term moderate intensity walking-based program on
incident mobility disability (38). Accelerometry is one is

its planned outcome measures and steps/day can be ana-
lyzed. The normative data presented here may be useful to
Lifestyle Interventions For Elderly researchers interested in
characterizing their sample compared to this nationally rep-
resentative sample. From a population level, characteristics
of those averaging 75th percentile values or higher, obtained
from Tables 3 and 4, might be described. Tracking activities
could be implemented to evaluate the relative impact (in
terms of changes in quintile rankings assembled in Table 2)
of program and policy interventions. These data could also
be directly accessed by clinicians and older adults them-
selves to compare their personal data to that of similar aged
peers' data contained in Tables 3 and 4.
Although previous research has shown that pedom-
eters miss steps taken by nursing home residents, they are
acceptably accurate in community-dwelling older adults
(39). The NHANES data were collected from noninstitu-
tionalized individuals, so the presented values that have
been adjusted to a pedometer-based scale can only be gen-
eralized to similar populations. In addition, these data are
U.S. centric and may not be generalizable to other world
populations. U.S. values for steps/day are among the low-
est in comparable population surveys (40). The data are
descriptive and focused on relative peer-based rankings
only, so cannot be used to infer threshold values associ-
ated with any health outcome. As mentioned previously,
pedometers were not used to collect data in NHANES,
and the process used to adjust these accelerometer data
to a pedometer-based scale ultimately represents a "best
guess," yet rational approach given known discrepancies
between these two types of instruments. No other nation-
ally representative data source can be used at this time to
produce better estimates.
In summary, these data fill a notable knowledge gap con-
cerning objectively monitored ambulatory activity of older
adults. They represent the first presentation of a detailed
population distribution of accelerometer-determined steps/
day adjusted to pedometer scaling, an instrument more
likely to be used in clinical and public health applications.
The percentiles presented herein will be useful to research-
ers and practitioners for multiple purposes.
