Abstract
Objectives: this study examined the association between medically recognized urinary incontinence and risk of
several disease conditions, hospitalization, nursing home admission and mortality.
Design: review and abstraction of medical records and computerized data bases from 5986 members, aged 65
years and older, of a large health maintenance organization in northern California.
Results: there was an increased risk of newly recognized urinary incontinence following a diagnosis of Parkinson's
disease, dementia, stroke, depression and congestive heart failure in both men and women, after adjustment for age
and cohort. The risk of hospitalization was 30% higher in women following the diagnosis of incontinence [relative
risk (RR) = 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CD = 1.2-1.5] and 50% higher in men (RR= 1.5, 95% CI = 1.3-1.6) after
adjustment for age, cohort and co-morbid conditions. The adjusted risk of admission to a nursing facility was 2.0
times greaterfor incontinent women (95% CI = 1.7-2.4) and 3.2 times greaterfor incontinent men (95% CI = 2.7-3-8).
In contrast, the adjusted risk of mortality was only slightly greater for women (RR= 1.1; 95% CI = 0.99-1-3) and
men(RR=1.2; 95% CI = 1.1-1.4).
Conclusions: urinary incontinence increases the risk of hospitalization and substantially increases the risk of
admission to a nursing home, independently of age, gender and the presence of other disease conditions, but has
little effect on total mortality.

Introduction
Urinary incontinence is a common condition in elderly
men and women. Population-based estimates of the
prevalence of urinary incontinence among older
women range from 34 to 45% for incontinence defined
as one or more episodes in the past year [1-4] and from
3 to 7% for incontinence denned as once or more
episodes per day [1-3, 5]. The prevalence of incon-
tinence in men has been less well studied, but appears
to be roughly one-half of that in women [2, 3, 5]. The
direct medical cost of urinary incontinence in the US
has been estimated at over 10 billion dollars each year
[6]. The indirect costs, due to increased risk of
hospitalization or nursing home admission, are
unknown.
Urinary incontinence has been associated with
several medical conditions, including neurological
disease [7], depression [5], cardiovascular disease [7]
and cerebrovascular disease [8]. However, these
associations have been based on cross-sectional data
which cannot establish the temporal relationship
between urinary incontinence and the associated
condition. In addition, previous studies have generally
relied on patient self-report of medical conditions,
rather than review of medical records.
Urinary incontinence has also been associated with
multiple hospital admissions and is believed to be an
important cause of admission to long-term care
facilities [8, 9]- While the prevalence of urinary
incontinence is higher in long-term care facilities [10]
and among individuals with multiple hospitalizations
367

[8], urinary incontinence has not been evaluated as a
risk factor for hospitalization or nursing home admis-
sion independently of other co-morbid conditions.
The current study examined the relation between
several medical conditions, documented by medical
record review and the subsequent diagnosis of urinary
incontinence over a 9-year period in two cohorts of
older adults, hi addition, the study assessed urinary
incontinence as an independent risk factor for hospi-
talization, nursing home admission and total mortality.
Methods
Study population
The study population consisted of two cohorts, each
composed of approximately 3000 randomly selected
members of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Northern
California (KFHP), a large health maintenance organi-
zation enrolling approximately 25% of the general
population in the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento
Metropolitan areas. As a traditional health maintenance
organization, KFHP provides virtually all care for its
members within its own facilities and thus has medical
records for over 90% of all office visits and hospitaliza-
tions by its members. All subjects had been KFHP
members for at least 5 years and over 80% had been
members for more than 10 years. The first cohort was
composed of 1453 women and 1420 men aged 65 or
older in 1971. The second cohort was composed of
1551 women and 1562 men aged 65 and older in 1980,
of whom 282 (9.1%) had also been part of the 1971
cohort. Both cohorts were randomly selected from
membership rolls stratified by age (65-69 years, 70-79
years and 80+ years) and gender to provide approxi-
mately equal numbers in each age-gender group. The
sampling fractions for each of the three age groups
were 5, 10 and 20%, respectively. Previous compar-
isons have shown that members of KFHP are generally
representative of the population in the same geographi-
cal area with respect to race and income (except at the
very high and very low ends of the income spectrum)
[11-13] and include a broad distribution of educa-
tional levels (11% less than high school, 20% high-
school graduates, 35% some college and 32% college
graduates) [13]-
Data collection
Subjects were followed for 9 years after the index year
by reviewing and abstracting inpatient and outpatient
medical records and by reviewing computerized hos-
pitalization data. The prevalence of each medical
condition at baseline was established by reviewing
medical records and hospitalization data for 4 years
prior to the index year. A pilot study found that 97% of
prevalent chronic conditions were mentioned within 4
years, even if the diagnosis had been made earlier.
Mortality was ascertained using the California Auto-
mated Mortality Linkage Information System [14] for
the 12-year period following the index year. Sixty-eight
subjects from both cohorts who died in the first 3 years
of the second cohort were counted in both cohorts and
represented 2.2% of all deaths. Subjects who died or
who disenrolled from KFHP during the 9-year period
were assigned a follow-up time equal to the difference
between the index date and the date of dropout. There
were no differences in dropout rates between the two
cohorts.
Detailed chart abstraction was performed by trained
research personnel using a structured abstraction
form. Information was abstracted for 32 medical
conditions and included the date of onset and the
date of diagnosis. In addition to data abstracted from
the subjects charts, hospitalizations and nursing home
admissions were available from the KFHP database.
The chart abstraction form did not distinguish between
urinary and faecal incontinence. To assess the degree
to which 'incontinence' referred to urinary incon-
tinence, a random sample of 49 charts from subjects
with a diagnosis of incontinence was reviewed. Forty-
six (94%) of the 49 subjects had a diagnosis of urinary
incontinence recorded in their chart. Of these 46, 40
(87%) had a diagnosis of only urinary incontinence and
six (13%) diagnoses of both urinary and faecal
incontinence. Only three (6%) of the 49 subjects had
a diagnosis of faecal incontinence without a diagnosis
of urinary incontinence.
Data analysis
The prevalence of incontinence and other diagnoses
was calculated as the percent of all observations in
each cohort at baseline who had had the condition
within the previous 4 years. Incidence rates for each
diagnosis were calculated as the number of newly
recognized events in the 9-year follow-up period,
excluding prevalent cases from the analyses, over the
total follow-up time in person-years per 1000. Follow-
up time for incidence rates was calculated as the time
from baseline to the first event, dropout, death or end
of study period, whichever occurred first. Similar
procedures were used for calculating rates of hospita-
lization, nursing home admissions and mortality by
incontinence status.
The association between disease condition and
incident incontinence was examined using a propor-
tional hazards model [15] with incontinence as the
dependent variable. The association between incident
or prevalent incontinence and the outcomes of hos-
pitalization, nursing home admission and mortality
were examined using a proportional hazards model.
Time from incident incontinence to the outcome of
interest (hospitalization, nursing home admission or
death) was used as a measure of survival time in those

·with incident incontinence. Time from baseline to the
outcome of interest was used as a measure of survival
time in those with prevalent incontinence.
All models were gender-specific and included adjust-
ment for cohort and for age (as a continuous variable).
Additional adjustment was made for co-morbid con-
ditions if including them in the model significantly
changed the estimated association between incon-
tinence and the variable of interest.
Results
The demographic characteristics for each cohort are
presented in Table 1. The age and gender distribution
reflects the gender- and age-stratified sampling used to
create the cohorts.
As shown in Table 2, the prevalence and incidence of
most of the 11 common disease conditions of interest
are similar (within 20%) between the two cohorts. The
exceptions are: hypertension and cerebral vascular
disease (strokes and transient ischaemic attacks),
which were more prevalent in the second cohort;
gout, which was more prevalent and had a higher
incidence in the second cohort; and incontinence,
which had a higher prevalence in the second cohort.
Subsequent analyses combine both cohorts, with
adjustment for cohort in all models.
Table 3 provides a more detailed look at the baseline
prevalence and incidence rate of incontinence by age
and gender. As expected, both incidence and pre-
valence increase with age for both men and women
and both are greater in women than men, with the
exception of incident incontinence among subjects
aged 80 and older.
The associations between incident incontinence and
previously diagnosed medical conditions of interest are
presented in Table 4. The first four conditions
(Parkinsonism, dementia, cerebral vascular disease,
depression and congestive heart failure) were selected
because of previously reported cross-sectional associa-
tions with urinary incontinence. The remaining two
conditions, osteoarthritis and gout, were selected
because they are common conditions which would
be expected to have little association with urinary
incontinence. The risk ratios for incontinence are
significantly elevated for subjects with a medical record
diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, dementia, cerebral
vascular disease and congestive heart failure, in both
men and women. Neither gout not osteoarthritis were
associated with an increased risk of incontinence in
men, but osteoarthritis was associated with a slightly
increased risk in women.
The association between prevalent or incident
incontinence and hospitalization and admission to a
skilled nursing facility is shown in Table 5. The
following co-morbid conditions were entered, step-
wise into the model: dementia, Parkinson's disease,
cerebral vascular disease, depression, congestive heart
failure, ischaemic heart disease, chronic lung disease,

Only those conditions that significantly affected the
estimated association between incontinence and the
risk of either hospitalization or nursing home admis-
sion were retained in the model. After adjustment for
age and cohort and the co-morbid conditions listed in
Table 5, women with incontinence were 30% more
likely to be hospitalized and twice as likely to be
admitted to a nursing home as women without incon-
tinence. Men with incontinence were 47% more likely
to be hospitalized and over three times more likely to
admitted to a nursing home.
The risk of mortality associated with medically
recognized incontinence was evaluated using the
same approach. The results, reported in Table 6,
show that the crude association between incontinence
and mortality was substantially less after adjustment for
co-morbid conditions. After adjustment, there
remained a non-significant increased risk for women
and a small but still significant increased risk (20%) for
men.

Discussion
This study offers several advantages over previous
studies in this area. Cohort data from a large,
representative population were used to examine,
prospectivery, the association between urinary incon-
tinence, other incident disease, hospitalization, nur-
sing home admissions and mortality. Diagnoses were
determined by medical record review, hospitalizations,
nursing home admission and mortality from computer-
ized data bases. The risks of hospitalization, nursing
home admission and mortality associated with incon-
tinence were analysed separately for men and women
and adjusted for co-morbid conditions, as well as age
and cohort.
Women were more likely to be incontinent at
baseline than men, a finding consistent with previous
studies of incontinence prevalence [2, 3, 5, 7, 16, 17].
The ratio of the prevalence of incontinence in women
to men was 1.5 for the 65-74-year-old group and
decreased with age. Most previous studies have
reported ratios around 2 for adults over 60 years of
age, although in older age groups (e.g. 85 years old and
older) and with more severe incontinence, ratios
below 1.5 have been reported [7, 17]. The incidence
of incontinence in the current study increased with age

and was similar in women and men. In contrast,
Herzog et al. reported approximately twice the
incidence of incontinence in women as in men aged
60 years and older [18]. However, when one looks at
the rate of new, severe incontinence among those
previously reporting no or mild incontinence in this
study, the rates for women and men are virtually the
same (6% versus 6.1% in first year, 4.5% versus 5.5% in
second year) [18]. The higher incidence among men in
the oldest age group of the current study (37%) may be
related to the higher prevalence of prostate disease in
this group. The increase in incidence of incontinence
between the two cohorts may represent an increased
sensitivity by providers to diagnosing and documenting
urinary incontinence for the later cohort.

The current study found that Parkinsonism and
cerebral vascular disease (stroke or transient ischaemic
attack) were each associated with an increased risk of
subsequent incontinence in men and women after
adjustment for age and cohort. Neurological disease
(not otherwise specified) has been associated with
urinary incontinence in a study of men and women
aged 85 and older [7]. An association between
incontinence and cerebrovascular disease has been
reported in women but not in men in one study [8].
However, stroke was not associated with incontinence
for either men or women in another study [19]. The
association between dementia and incontinence,
found in the current study, has been previously
reported in cross-sectional studies [20], including at
least one that was population-based [17]. The associa-
tion between depression and incontinence in the
current study is consistent with a previous popula-
tion-based study which found depression to be more
common among subjects with incontinence [5]. The
current study also found an increased risk of incon-
tinence following the diagnosis of congestive heart
failure. Another population-based study reported a
significant association between urinary incontinence
and cardiovascular disease in women only [7], but did
not examine congestive heart failure separately.
These previous studies were all cross-sectional and
relied on patient self-reporting. The associations repor-
ted in the current prospective study suggest that
incontinence follows the medically documented diag-
nosis of each of these conditions. However, while the
prospective nature of the data helps to identify the
temporal relation between diagnosis of incontinence
and diagnosis of other conditions, it cannot establish
the temporal relationship between the onset of
symptoms, since both urinary incontinence and the
371
D. H. Thorn et al.
conditions with which it was associated may have
substantial lag periods between onset of symptoms and
diagnosis. It is possible that the onset of a new disease
condition might worsen pre-existing incontinence and
lead to its diagnosis or might lead to a diagnosis of pre-
existing incontinence due to increased medical atten-
tion. Even when incontinence clearly follows the
development of a medical condition, the relationship
may not be causal, but may reflect a common relation-
ship with a third factor. For example, impaired mobility
has been suggested as an important mediating factor in
dementia and other neurological diseases [21]. Such a
mechanism might explain the modest association
found between arthritis and incontinence among
women in the current study and previously reported
in a cross-sectional population study [19]. For con-
gestive heart failure, the association with incontinence
could be mediated through treatment with a diuretic.
Unlike the other conditions investigated in this
study, depression could as easily be a consequence of
incontinence as a cause. Since both depression and
incontinence can have a substantial lag time from
symptoms to diagnosis, it is possible that the associa-
tion observed is in part due to undiagnosed incon-
tinence preceding depression. To explore this
possibility, the data were analysed to determine the
association between prevalent incontinence and the
subsequent risk of depression. For women, there was
no increased risk of subsequent depression among
those with previously diagnosed incontinence after
adjustment for age and cohort (risk ratio = 0.9, 95%
CI = 0.6-1.6), while in men the age and cohort-
adjusted risk of depression was greater among those
with incontinence (risk ratio = 2.4,95% Q = 1.6-3.7),
suggesting that the relationship may be bi-directional
in men.
The association between incontinence and admis-
sion to a nursing home supports the commonly held
belief that urinary incontinence is an important risk
factor for nursing home admission [9]. At least one
previous study showed incontinence, particularly in
the presence of aggressive behaviour, to be a significant
predictor of nursing home admission among demented
outpatients [22]. The association between inconti-
nence and risks of hospitalization and nursing home
admission in the current study persisted even after
adjustment for age, gender and multiple co-morbid
conditions. It is possible that one or more additional
factors, not in the data set and therefore not controlled
for, could be associated with both incontinence and
nursing home admission, but the persistence of the
association after adjustment for multiple disease
conditions makes this explanation unlikely.
Previous studies have suggested that incontinence,
especially of new onset, may be an independent risk
factor for increased mortality among hospitalized
patients with pneumonia [23] and patients admitted
to anursing home [24]. The resultsfrom population-based
studies of the association between urinary inconti-
nence and mortality have not been consistent. One
study of 559 older adults, including those in institu-
tions, reported that the 3-year mortality for incontinent
subjects was over twice that of continent subjects [17].
However, when survival was plotted by age, the
difference was much less. A recent study by Herzog
et al. of nearly 2000 community-residing older adults
found no association between incontinence and risk of
death after adjusting for age, education, number of
medical conditions and self-assessed health status [25].
The current results of a small increased risk of mortality
among incontinent men only tends to support the
study by Herzog et al. It is possible that the small
association remaining after adjustment in the current
studyreflectsan association between incontinence and
other health conditions not measured (and therefore
not adjusted for in the data). These results suggest that
in contrast to the associations between incontinence
and hospitalizations and nursing home admission,
where the presence of incontinence can plausibly
play a direct role in the decision to institutionalize, the
association between incontinence and mortality is
probably mediated primarily through co-morbid
disease conditions.
The current study has several limitations. Approxi-
mately 6% of the subjects with incontinence had faecal
incontinence only. However, this small proportion
would not be likely to have a large effect on the study's
findings. The study also relied on incontinence noted
in the patient's medical record. Studies have shown
that only about one-third of all people with urinary
incontinence seek medical attention [1, 4] and those
with more severe incontinence are more likely to seek
help. Most studies use one or more definitions of
urinary incontinence based on an average or on the
most recent number of episodes over a past period of
time (from 1 day to 12 months). However, using a
definition of 'medically noted' urinary incontinence
has the advantage of representing what providers 'see'
in their practice. The prevalence of urinary incon-
tinence found in this study--about 7% for women and
5% for men--is similar to the prevalence for incon-
tinence occurring several times per week or more
reported in previous studies [2, 3, 5, 7, 16, 17].
Defining incident urinary incontinence is by nature
difficult, as onset is often gradual and remission
common [2]. For this reason, few studies even attempt
to address incident incontinence [2]. The current study
used a precise definition of urinary incontinence--its
first mention in the medical record--recognizing that
this lags behind the actual onset. It is also possible that
the diagnosis of particular conditions would have
triggered an inquiry into the presence of incontinence,
creating a false association between the condition and
incontinence.
A final limitation is that no direct measure of
functional status was available in the current study
372
Incontinence, institutionalization and mortality
and in fact -would not be feasible for a study of this size
and for this length of follow-up. The large amount of
data on co-morbid conditions was used as a proxy for
functional status. In addition, functional status, as
measured by such commonly used scales as the
Instrumental Activities of Daily Living [26], Activities
of Daily Living [27] or the Barthel index [28] is partially
determined by continence status. The later two scales
include incontinence in the measure and the first
includes activities that may be indirectly related to
incontinence (e.g. shopping, housekeeping). It is
nonetheless possible that functional limitations other
than those caused by urinary incontinence or mea-
sured co-morbid conditions could explain some or all of
the association between incontinence and hospitaliza-
tion and nursing home admission reported in this
study.
The current study confirmed and extended previous
findings of an association between urinary inconti-
nence and several other disease conditions and
suggested that incontinence is associated with a
significantly increased risk of hospital and nursing
home admissions independently of age, gender and
multiple co-morbid conditions. Further studies are
needed to establish the independent contribution of
urinary incontinence to the risk of institutionalization
and to determine whether interventions to reduce
urinary incontinence are also effective in reducing the
risk of institutionalization.

was increased following diagnosis of Parkinson's
disease, dementia, stroke, depression and conges-
tive heart failure.
· The adjusted risk of hospitalization was 30% higher
among incontinent women and 50% higher among
incontinent men.
· The adjusted risk of nursing home admissions was
two times greater in incontinent women and over
three times greater in incontinent men.
· The adjusted mortality rate did not differ signifi-
cantly by continence status for either women or
men.
