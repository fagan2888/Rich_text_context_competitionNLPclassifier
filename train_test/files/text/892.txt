Objectives. This study's focus on the retiree identity complements research on institutionalized retirement criteria. We test
whether tensions between individuals' own life circumstances and institutionalized retirement criteria manifest themselves in
the extent to which individuals assume a retiree identity and in the overlap between self-definitions and attainment of institu-
tionalized retirement criteria.
Methods. The analyses rely on logistic regressions and are based on data from the National Survey of Families and
Households (N=l,633).
Results. Labor force participation serves as the main basis for the retiree identity, but other life experiences (work history,
disability, spouse's retirement, economic status, family history) also contribute to individuals' self-identification as retiree and
the "fit" between self-identification and attainment of institutionalized retirement criteria. Men's retirement identity seems more
closely tied to their attainment of institutionalized retirement criteria and a continuous and successful work career, whereas a
variety of life circumstances impinge on women's retiree definitions. Moderately disabled African Americans are more likely to
self-identify as partly or fully retired.
Discussion. While employment constitutes the main reference for individuals' self-definition as retiree, other life circum-
stances also have some influence. Full understanding of retirement transitions will require more attention to the meaning con-
text of retirement among divergent population groups.
RETIREMENT has become an institutionalized and ac-
. cepted life course transition in postindustrial societies
(Kohli, 1986; Quadagno & Hardy, 1996). Consequently, the re-
tirement transition process, as well as its precursors, are guided
by a set of expectations that specify the meaning of retirement,
its timing, and, to some extent, appropriate role behaviors
(Ekerdt, 1986). Though essentially derived from economic and
political initiatives (employer pensions, Social Security), these
expectations also constitute a basis for individuals' identifica-
tion with the retiree role. For example, anticipation of retire-
ment leads to psychological disengagement from the work role
(Ekerdt & DeViney, 1993). However, some persons or groups
may not assume a retiree identity when they leave the labor
force or become beneficiaries.
Retirement research has emphasized institutionalized, or ob-
jective, retirement criteria such as labor supply or pension re-
ceipt, but paid relatively little tribute to individuals' own defini-
tions or their subjective retiree identity. For example,
investigations documenting the complexity and dynamics of re-
tirement transition processes typically center on such events as
partial retirement (Burr, Massagli, Mutchler, & Pienta, 1996;
Gustman & Steinmeier, 1984a, 1984b, 1986; Honig, 1985;
Honig & Hanoch, 1985), bridge jobs (Quinn & Kozy, 1996),
and work after retirement (Hayward & Grady, 1990; Morrow-
Howell & Leon, 1988) or after the receipt of pension benefits
(Gendell & Siegel, 1996; Holden, 1988; lams, 1986; Wray,
1996). Concerns about the definition of retirement (Palmore,
1965) stimulated studies exploring the extent of overlap among
divergent retirement criteria (Ekerdt & DeViney, 1990; Parnes
& Less, 1985; Zsembik & Singer, 1990). However, these inves-
tigations tend to view disparity among retirement criteria more
as a validity rather than as an identity issue. Others explored
specific subgroups of retirees who do not fit well into tradi-
tional retirement categories; for instance, available nonworkers
(Hardy, 1991), disabled nonworkers (Gibson, 1987, 1991,
1993), or retired housewives (Adelmann, Antonucci, &
Jackson, 1993; Heyman, 1970). These latter studies provide
some initial evidence that individuals' retiree identity is not
only influenced by institutionalized criteria (labor force with-
drawal, pensions) but also reflects complex life course pro-
cesses such as work, health, or family history (Belgrave, 1988,
1989; Gibson, 1987, 1991, 1993; Hardy, 1991; Hayward &
Grady, 1990; Zsembik & Singer, 1990).
While it is certainly essential to explore the precedents and
consequences of labor force exit or benefit receipt, full under-
standing of retirement processes also requires examination of
persons' identification with the retiree role. Whether and at what
time during the objectively and institutionally defined retirement
process individuals assume the retiree identity may have impor-
tant consequences for their behaviors, attitudes, and, ultimately,
their well being. For example, studies show that early retirees
are more prone to reenter the labor market (Hayward, Hardy, &
Liu, 1994), that perceptions of untimely retirement hinder retire-
ment adjustment (Szinovacz, 1989), or that low identification
with one's work role can underminejob satisfaction and feelings
of self-worth (Mutran, Reitzes, Bratton, & Fernandez, 1997).
Similar outcomes may characterize individuals who experience
dissonance between their objective retirement status and their
subjective identification with the retiree role.
As retirement transitions become increasingly blurred
(Hayward, Crimmins, & Wray, 1994; Henretta, 1997;
Quadagno & Hardy, 1996), disparity between objective retire-
ment criteria and individuals' serf-definitions as retiree may be-
come more common. This could mean that larger population
S207
S208 SZINOVACZAND DEVINEY
groups will be less susceptible to program and policy incentives
geared toward retirees. For example, the "retiree busy ethic"
(Ekerdt, 1986) secures a supply of volunteers and leisure con-
sumers, but such activities may not appeal to individuals who
reject the retiree role. It could also imply that more retirees will
pursue activities (e.g., reentry into the labor market) that are in-
consistent with societal expectations and policies. Indeed,
blurred retirement transitions could be viewed as manifesta-
tions of clashes between institutional expectations and personal
pursuits. Thus, a focus on retirement identity and its sources
can contribute to a more in-depth understanding of the reasons
for such blurred boundaries.
Distinction between retirement as defined by institutional-
ized criteria (e.g., labor force withdrawal) and the retiree iden-
tity draws further attention to tensions between institutionalized
programs or policies and subgroup experiences (Kohli, 1986).
Such tensions are evident from research demonstrating that dis-
parity between institutionalized and subjective retirement defi-
nitions prevails among selected societal groups, such as women
and minorities (Ekerdt & DeViney, 1990; Gibson, 1993). For
example, rejection of the retiree identity among older African
Americans who have exited the labor force can be traced to the
consequences of racial discrimination, both in the labor market
and in the health care system (Gibson, 1991; Hayward,
Friedman, & Chen, 1996), and ambiguities in women's retire-
ment definitions reflect conflicts between the work require-
ments and family wage assumptions implied in retirement poli-
cies and expectations about women's family and gender roles
(Belgrave, 1989). Analyses of gender or race differences in ob-
jective retirement processes can identify the sources (e.g, dis-
ability) and economic consequences (e.g., reduced benefits) of
atypical retirement transitions among societal subgroups
(Hayward et al., 1996; Meyer, 1990), but not their more per-
sonal ramifications (e.g., acceptance of the retiree role and its
implications for well-being). Consideration of subjective retire-
ment definitions would, therefore, seem particularly important
to further understanding of retirement processes and their con-
sequences among women and minorities.
In this article, we aim to enhance understanding of individu-
als' retiree identity by exploring the conditions under which in-
dividuals define themselves as retired and the conditions that
contribute to disparity between objective and subjective retire-
ment definitions. Examination of the precursors of retirement
self-definitions can offer insights into potential tensions be-
tween institutionalized retirement processes and subjective ex-
periences by pinpointing which life course experiences and
conditions, other than institutionalized criteria, contribute to the
retiree identity. Also, investigation of discrepancies between
subjective and objective retirement definitions can show under
which conditions objective retirement transitions promote or
inhibit assumption of a retiree identity. Race and gender effects
on retirement self-definitions and on disparity between objective
and subjective retirement definitions, as well as race and gender
differences in the conditions leading to such self-definitions and
disparity, can reveal whether observed subgroup differences de-
rive from exposure to specific life course experiences.
We proceed from the assumption that the retiree identity
evolves from interpretative processes that link institutionalized
retirement criteria to individuals' current and past experiences,
that is, what individuals make of the retiree role (Turner, 1962).
Individuals will usually define themselves as retiree if their life
circumstances fit institutionalized retirement criteria, that is,
when there is little tension between institutional programs and
subjective construction of the life course (Kohli, 1986). Indeed,
previous research demonstrates considerable congruity between
objective and subjective retirement definitions (Ekerdt &
DeViney, 1990; Parnes & Less, 1985). However, specific life
circumstances impede the applicability of societal retirement
criteria. Lack ofjob opportunities or disability can bar access to
the labor force, and discontinuous work histories may render
the exact time of retirement ambiguous (Hardy, 1991; Gibson,
1991, 1993). Also, work obligations outside the labor force
(e.g., family or volunteer work) may clash with expectations of
the retiree role, and housewives especially may find that soci-
etal retirement criteria offer few guidelines for their situation
(Adelmann et al., 1993; Heyman, 1970). Under such condi-
tions, interpretative processes grounded in individuals' life
course experiences are likely to play a paramount role in retire-
ment definitions. Thus, the more individuals' cultural and life
course experiences depart from institutionalized patterns, the
more their retirement definition processes will shift from mere
roletaking to rolemaking.
Based on this argument, four sets of factors can be expected
to influence retirement definitions: (a) attainments linked to in-
stitutionalized retirement criteria; (b) life course experiences
pertaining to individuals' work history as well as to the impor-
tance of the work career in their lives; (c) socioeconomic status;
and (d) membership in cultural or subcultural groups that de-
fines the meaning context of work and retirement, influences
access to work and retirement benefits, and, to some extent,
structures individuals' life course experiences.
The institutionalization of retirement in modern societies can
be traced to the implementation of Social Security and em-
ployer pensions (Henretta, 1994; Kohli, 1994). Retirement, as
an institution, delineates the rights and duties associated with
the retiree status, as well as the timing of the transition to
retirement. At least in the United States (Sainsbury, 1996;
Williamson & Pampel, 1993), retirement entitlements both in
the public (Social Security) and private sector (employer pen-
sions) are tied to individuals' work careers (years in the labor
force or firm, earnings) and serve as a definitional basis for re-
tirement status (Ekerdt, Deviney, & Kosloski, 1994). Because
of their regulatory function (Kohli, 1986), these entitlements re-
quire at least partial withdrawal from the labor force.
Individuals who fail to meet this condition are penalized (re-
duced benefits). In addition, retirement as an institution estab-
lishes age expectations for the retirement transition (what Kohli,
1986, calls chronologization of the life course). Despite the
abolishment of mandatory retirement, such expectations persist
through age constraints in the Social Security program. Thus,
institutionalized retirement criteria combine attainment of enti-
tlements (receipt of Social Security or pensions), fulfillment of
obligations (continuous employment, withdrawal from the
labor force at age 62 or 65), and achievement of retirement age.
However, premises of the male breadwinner role and the family
wage that are inherent in many Social Security and pension
schemes (Sainsbury, 1996) sever, to some extent, the direct link
between individuals' own work careers and their retirement en-
titlements. Consequently, selected features of individuals' mari-
tal history (length of marriages, widowhood), as well as their
RETIREMENTDEFINITIONS S209
spouses' work careers and benefit entitlements, also become
part of institutionalized retirement criteria.
Inherent in institutionalized retirement is the presumption of
a life course which is characterized by fairly uninterrupted work
careers, withdrawal from the labor force at a certain age, and a
family wage. Whenever these criteria are not met, individuals
either may not qualify for benefits at all or may receive some-
times substantially reduced benefits (DeViney & Solomon,
1995; Meyer, 1990; O'Rand, 1988). These penalties, as well as
discrepancies between the "normative life course" (as reflected
in institutionalized criteria) and individuals' own life course ex-
periences, may give rise to subjective retirement definitions that
differ from institutionalized criteria. Several conditions account
for such discrepancies. First, institutionalized public and private
criteria may diverge. Employer pensions and employer retire-
ment incentives sometimes induce individuals to leave their
jobs before they are eligible for Social Security benefits
(Applebaum & Gregory, 1990; Hanks, 1990; Quinn & Kozy,
1996). In such cases, persons may either retire early, that is,
leave the labor force prior to the age criteria set by Social
Security, or take on a bridge job until they qualify for Social
Security benefits. In this situation, assumption of the retiree
identity is ambiguous--it may occur either at the time of with-
drawal from the main career or at the time of final withdrawal
from the labor force.
Second, retirement transitions diverge increasingly from the
traditional abrupt and complete labor force withdrawal at the
institutionalized (Social Security) retirement age. Some indi-
viduals may continue employment (perhaps at reduced hours or
in bridge jobs) past the usual retirement age, either because
they enjoy their careers or because of financial need. Once
again this may create discrepancies between institutionalized
retirement criteria (especially age and benefit receipt) and a
person's self-definition as retiree. In addition, the self-employed
tend toward a more gradual and blurred withdrawal from the
labor force than those employed by others (Mutchler, Burr,
Pienta, & Massagli, 1997), which is likely to render a clear de-
marcation between work and retirement more difficult. Others
may be forced out of the labor force (either for health reasons
or for lack ofjob opportunities) before selected institutionalized
retirement criteria are met. These individuals may meet the re-
tirement criterion of withdrawal from the labor force but reject
a retiree identity because of the involuntary nature of such with-
drawal (Gibson, 1993; Hardy, 1991).
In addition, the retiree identity is likely to reflect the impor-
tance and continuity of the work role in individuals' lives.
Persons with discontinuous work histories may find it difficult
to demarcate the exact time of retirement or view themselves as
partially retired (Honig, 1985; Honig & Hanoch, 1985),
whereas those with marginal attachments to the labor force but
heavy involvement in nonpaid labor (e.g., housewives) may re-
ject either the retiree identity altogether, or base it on other life
circumstances such as the retirement of the spouse (Adelman et
al., 1993; Heyman, 1970).
Life circumstances that do not fit the patterns implied in institu-
tionalized retirement programs predominate among selected popu-
lation groups, especially women and minorities. This is evident
from race and gender differences in the meaning of and reasons for
retirement (Gibson, 1993; Hanson & Wapner, 1994), as well as in
the prevalence of inconsistency among retirement criteria
(Belgrave, 1988,1989; Ekerdt & DeViney, 1990; Gibson, 1987,
1991,1993; Hatch, 1990; Zsembik & Singer, 1990). One factor
contributing to ambiguities in the retirement definition of women is
their heavy involvement in family roles and its consequences.
Women's involvement in family roles competes with their role as
employee and often results in discontinuous work histories (Pienta,
Burr, & Mutchler, 1994) that render distinctions between work in-
terruptions and retirement more difficult (Belgrave, 1989; Sherrell
& Halleen, 1996; Zsembik & Singer, 1990). Such discontinuous
work is likely to prevail among women with early and/or multiple
childbearing histories. Probably because of continuing family work
obligations, women also attach a different meaning to retirement
than men. Whereas men view retirement as a distinct life transition
(new beginning, imposed disruption, transition to old age), women
stress continuity in their pre- and post-retirement lives (Hanson &
Wapner, 1994). Discontinuities in their work histories, as well as
sex discrimination in the labor market, often result in low retire-
ment incomes among women. Consequently, divorced women
who do not qualify for husbands' benefits may have to postpone
labor force withdrawal past the institutionalized retirement age to
secure adequate retirement incomes (Morgan, 1992; DeViney,
1995; Appelbaum & Gregory, 1990; DeViney & Solomon, 1995).
Assumption of the retiree identity may be adapted subjec-
tively to fit societal prescriptions about gender roles in the mari-
tal system. Because husbands continue to be viewed as main
providers, they may reject the retiree role or postpone retirement
beyond institutionalized retirement age as long as their wives are
still employed. Research indicates, for example, that a spouse's
labor force participation serves as a strong incentive to remain in
the labor force (Ruhm, 1996; Szinovacz, 1989). Conversely, re-
tired husbands exerting pressure on their wives to retire as well
may contribute to inconsistency in retirement definitions, if
wives leave the labor force before they reach pension or Social
Security eligibility (Skirboll & Silverman, 1992; Szinovacz,
1989). Wives may self-define as retirees on the basis of their
husbands' retirement status (Belgrave, 1989), and widows may
base retirement self-definitions on the receipt of widow pen-
sions. Thus, spouse's retirement and widowhood can promote
self-definitions as retiree and disparity between objective and
subjective retirement definitions. Because men's breadwinner
role places primary importance on their work achievements, we
expect family and marital life experiences to have a more pro-
found influence on women's than on men's retiree identity.
Discrimination in the labor market, as well as disability, have
been linked to early labor force withdrawal and/or unemploy-
ment in later life among minorities (Burr et al., 1996; Hayward &
Grady, 1990; Hayward et al., 1996). Because such adverse cir-
cumstances promote involuntary exits from paid employment,
minorities may reject the retiree identity. For example, African
Americans define themselves more in terms of a sick role than as
retirees (Gibson, 1987,1991,1993; Hardy, 1991; Hayward &
Grady, 1990) and frequently exit the labor force because of dis-
abling health conditions (Hayward et al., 1996). Similarly,
marginal attachment to the labor force among minorities through-
out the life course may render the retirement transition (i.e., the
transition from intermittent employment or unemployment to
final labor force withdrawal) blurred, if not meaningless.
In summary, we contend that the retiree identity emerges
from the complex interplay between institutionalized retirement
criteria, individuals' life course experiences, and cultural con-
S210 SZINOVACZAND DEVINEY
text. To the extent that individuals' life course experiences do
notfitthe life course implied in institutionalized retirement pro-
grams, clear demarcations of the retirement transition become
ambiguous. Consequently, such life course experiences (and
sociocultural contexts that sustain and bolster exposure to these
life course experiences) will promote rejection of the retiree
identity when selected institutionalized retirement criteria are
met, or assumption of the retiree identity when institutionalized
criteria are not met, thus contributing to disparity between se-
lected institutionalized retirement criteria and individuals' re-
tiree identity. Based on these premises, we hypothesize:
1. Women and African Americans will be less likely than men
and Whites to define themselves as retirees and more likely
to encounter disparity between subjective retirement and ob-
jective retirement criteria. These race and gender differences
will be reduced (though not necessarily eliminated) when in-
stitutionalized criteria and selected life course experiences
(disability, work and family histories) are controlled.
2. Selected characteristics of individuals' life course experi-
ences will influence the retiree identity, as well as disparity
between self-identification as retiree and selected institution-
alized criteria, beyond the effect of (other) institutionalized
criteria (i.e., when such criteria are controlled). Specifically,
rejection of the retiree identity and disparity between subjec-
tive retirement and objective retirement criteria will be more
common among individuals who have relatively low in-
comes, are self-employed, experienced more and/or longer
work disruptions, were seeking employment after their last
job, receive public assistance, and are disabled.
3. Attainment of institutionalized retirement criteria (labor
force withdrawal, pensions, Social Security benefits, institu-
tionalized retirement age, spouse's retirement) will promote
self-identification as retiree.
4. Disparity between self-definition as retiree and selected insti-
tutionalized retirement criteria (e.g., self-definition as retiree
among individuals who are still in the labor force) will be re-
duced when other institutionalized criteria (benefits, retire-
ment age) are met. However, receipt of employer pensions may
lead to self-identification as retiree among current workers.
5. The impact of institutionalized retirement criteria and selected
life course experiences on the retiree identity, and on disparity
between self-identification as retiree and selected institutional-
ized criteria, will vary by race and gender. Spouse's retirement,
the experience of divorce or widowhood, number of children,
and timing of births will be more influential for women than
for men. Disability is expected to exert greater influence on the
retiree identity and on disparity between objective and subjec-
tive retirement definitions of Blacks than ofWhites.
METHODS
Sample.--This study relies on secondary analyses of the
National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH). The
NSFH used a multistage area probability sample that was aug-
mented by oversampling of minorities, one-parent families,
families with stepchildren, cohabitors, and recently married in-
dividuals. The original sample (including the oversample) con-
sisted of 33,869 addresses. These addresses were screened first,
and successfully screened households were approached for in-
terviews. First wave interview response rates for the success-
fully screened households were 73.5% for the main sample,
and 76.8% for the oversample, resulting in a total sample of
13,008 respondents. (For a detailed description of the study, see
Sweet, Bumpass, & Call, 1988). The Wave 2 interviews were
completed by 10,008 respondents, representing an attrition rate
of 23.2%.
The two waves of data were collected in 1987/1988, and in
1992 to 1994. Data were collected from randomly selected
household members aged 19 years or older, their spouses and,
in some cases, tertiary household members. In both waves, re-
spondents were interviewed and also completed a self-adminis-
tered questionnaire. Interviews lasted typically between 70 min-
utes and two hours.
The subsample used in the present analyses consists of respon-
dents aged 50 to 75 years at Time 2 who reported some employ-
ment during their life and responded to the retirement self-defini-
tion questions. Reliance on Time 2 responses was necessary
because only this wave contained questions on respondents' self-
definition as retiree. Approximately 14% of respondents failed to
answer questions about their self-perception as retiree. Because
imputation of missing data for this dependent variable may lead
to overestimates of relationships with the independent variables,
missing cases were excluded. This exclusion may compromise
generalizability slightly. Comparisons between respondents who
did and those who did not answer the retirement self-definition
questions reveal that missing cases are somewhat overrepre-
sented among individuals with lower incomes and health prob-
lems. However, the differences are quite small (r < .10), and
there are no significant differences between respondents and
nonrespondents by gender, race, marital status, receipt of pen-
sions, or unemployment. Also excluded were minorities other
than African Americans. Subgroups of these minorities
(Hispanic, Asian, etc.) are too small to allow separate analyses
and the combined group would represent populations with quite
divergent employment histories and socioeconomic back-
grounds. The resulting subsample size is 1,633, unweighted.
Measures.--The dependent variables are individuals' self-
definition as retiree as well as two measures of disparity be-
tween subjective retirement definition and objective retirement
criteria, namely, labor force participation and benefit receipt.
Self-reported retirement was derived from responses to the
question: "At this time, do you consider yourself partly retired,
fully retired, or not retired at all?" Laborforce participation
was derived from respondents' reported work hours at Time 2.
Those who reported some work hours during the past week
and/or indicated that they usually engage in employment activi-
ties were considered employed, those with 0 work hours re-
tired. Receipt of benefits was based on questions about pension
receipt and income from diverse sources. Respondents who in-
dicated that they currently received a pension, or reported in-
come from private pensions, were coded 1. Also coded 1 were
individuals who reported Social Security income and who were
eligible for Social Security (married, divorced, or never married
respondents aged 62 and older, and widows aged 60 and older).
Computations of disparity between laborforce participation
and self-reported retirement rely on employment status and
work hours. Respondents were deemed to be congruent if they:
(a) reported to be employed and indicated they were "not at all
RETIREMENTDEFINITIONS S211
retired;" (b) classified themselves as "partly retired" and
worked less than 40 hours per week; and (c) reported no em-
ployment and considered themselves "fully retired." There are
two groups whose subjective and objective retirement defini-
tions are incongruent. The first group contains individuals who
indicate that they work 40 or more hours per week, but con-
sider themselves partly or fully retired, as well as those who
work (regardless of work hours) and report full retirement. The
second group consists of respondents who are not employed
but identify themselves as not retired or only partly retired.
Frequencies for this variable revealed that only very few per-
sons fell into the first group (N=41 or 2.4%). These individuals,
as well as respondents with inconsistent employment informa-
tion (employed with 0 work hours, N=31) were excluded from
the final analyses. Thus, Ate for this dependent variable are
smaller than Ns for the other dependent variables.
Disparity between benefits and self-reported retirement was
coded congruent if respondents reported either no benefits and
not being retired, or if they considered themselves retired
(partly or fully) and received benefits. Those receiving benefits
but classifying themselves as "not retired at all" constitute one
incongruent group (benefits, not retired), whereas individuals
without benefits but self-reported partial or full retirement make
up the second incongruent group (retired, no benefits). The dis-
tribution of the dependent variables is shown in Table 1.
Independent variables.--Three sets of independent variables
were used in the analyses: background variables, institutional-
ized retirement criteria, and selected life course experiences and
circumstances.
Background characteristics were gender, race, education, re-
spondent's and spouse's income, and receipt of public assis-
tance. Education was coded in years, with a range from 0 to 18.
Income was based on constructed measures provided in the
NSFH. The income variable used here is respondent's total in-
come from all sources. Income was coded in $100 units and
logged. Spouse's income was dichotomized ($30,000 and over
= 1, other = 0). Information on public assistance was based on
reported income sources. A code of 1 was assigned if respon-
dents reported income from public assistance (welfare, AFDC,
general assistance, food stamps, or SSI). Even though income
and public assistance overlap, we include both variables be-
cause receipt of public assistance may have different ramifica-
tions for the retiree identity than low income per se.
The life experiences and conditions included in the analyses
were disability, marital status, fertility, and work history. Work
disability was based on a question concerning limitations in ac-
tivities of daily living. Working for pay was one of the listed ac-
tivities. Respondents indicated whether they were limited "a lit-
tle" or "a lot." These responses were used as dummy variables,
and respondents with no limitations are the omitted category.
Because past experiences of divorce or widowhood may affect
the retiree identity, we conducted initial analyses that consid-
ered the influence of length of time married, divorced, or wid-
owed, as well as whether currently married persons had been
divorced or widowed. These analyses revealed that only past
experiences of widowhood had significant effects on any of the
dependent variables. Thus, marital status was captured through
four dummy variables: currently widowed, currently divorced,
never married, and currently married after widowhood. Married
individuals without experiences of widowhood are the refer-
ence group. Fertility was measured with number of children
born and the timing of the first birth (early = age 21 or under,
late = age 30 or over, reference = 22 to 29). An additional set of
dummy variables capturing the time interval between first and
last births did not contribute to the models once number and
timing of births was considered. The following work history
variables were used in the analyses: total number of years in the

labor force, number of work interruptions, occurrence of work
interruptions since Wave 1, and self-employment at Time 1.
Number of years in the labor force is a continuous variable,
which was constructed from work histories collected at both
waves. Number of work interruptions was also based on work
histories from both waves. Because three or more interruptions
were quite rare, we created a dummy variable (1 = two or more
interruptions, 0-1 interruption = reference). Recent work dis-
ruptions may be indicative of blurred retirement transitions.
This variable was derived from the Wave 2 work histories and
coded 1 = yes, 0 = no. Self-employment (at Time 1) was de-
rived from reported self-employment income. Those with such
income were coded 1, all others 0. Time 1 self-employment
was used to avoid overlap with current labor force participation.
Institutionalized retirement criteria consist of age, benefits, and
labor force participation. To reflect distance from institutionalized
retirement age, the age variable was divided into five categories:
55-59,60-61,62-64,65-69, and 70-75. Respondents who had
achieved retirement age (65-69) were used as reference, the other
age groups were treated as dummy variables. Information on pen-

cModel 1 tests race, gender, and age effects; Model 2 adds selected life experiences and conditions; Model 3 adds institutionalized retirement criteria and socioeco-
nomic background but excludes life circumstances that do not contribute to model fit. The analyses rely on two separate equations, one with not retired and the other
with fully retired as base categories. The exponentiated value of a coefficient eb is the relative risk ratio for a one unit change in the corresponding variable; risk is
being measured as the risk of the category relative to the base category (Stata, 1997, Vol. 2, p. 542). Relative risk ratios over 1.00 indicate a positive and those under
1.00 a negative effect. All comparisons are based on the same equations, but the reference groups were altered (either not retired-first two columns for each model, or
fully retired-last column for each model; see also Analysis section).

sion receipt was derived from a direct question: "Are you now re-
ceiving benefits from a pension or retirement plan?" Respondents
were instructed not to include Social Security in their answers. In
addition, data on pension and (separately) Social Security income
were obtained during the interviews. Receipt of pensions and
Social Security were coded as dummy variables (1 = reports a
pension and/or pension income; 1 = receives Social Security in-
come). The same procedure was used for spouses' pensions.
Because of multicollinearity with the marital status variables,
spouses' receipt of Social Security was not included in the analy-
ses. Labor force participation was coded into three dummy vari-
ables: employed full-time (30 hours or more), employed part-time
(1-29 hours), andjob seekers (individuals who are currently not
working but had looked for work since their last employment).
Those not employed and not looking for work serve as reference.
For spouses, we included subjective retirement (is fully retired =
1) rather than employment status. The two variables are highly
correlated and spouse's retirement identity proved to be the better
predictor in preliminary analyses.
Analyses.--The analyses consist of multinomial or dichoto-
mous logistic regressions. We first tested models (Model 1 in
the tables) including only race, gender, and age to assess the in-
fluence of these variables independent of the other independent
variables. Race X gender interactions proved to be not signifi-
cant for all dependent variables. In the second model, life
course experiences (education, disability, marital status, fertil-
ity, and work history) were added. We then tested models that
included race, gender, selected life course experiences, other
background variables, and the appropriate institutionalized re-
tirement criteria. Criteria implied in the dependent variables
(labor force participation and job seeking for analyses of dis-
parity between labor force participation and retiree identity and
benefits, except spouse's pension, for analyses of disparity be-
tween benefits and retiree identity) were excluded as indepen-
dent variables. Based on these analyses, the final models
(Model 3 in the tables) contain gender, race, age, disability, and
marital status, as well as those life course experiences and insti-
tutionalized criteria that contributed to model fit.
For the analyses pertaining to retiree serf-definitions (Table 2),
we are interested in contrasts between those who self-define as
fully or partly, compared with those who self-define as not re-
tired, as well as contrasts between self-definitions as full and part
retirees. Consequently, the same models were estimated twice,
once with "not retired" and once with "fully retired" as base cate-
gory. Modelfitfor these two models is, of course, the same.
Due to small Ns, race interactions were tested only for dis-
ability. Predicted gender interactions were tested both in the life
experience models and in the final models. In addition, we also
systematically tested for gender interactions with all institution-
alized retirement criteria and with the work history variables.
Continuous variables used in interaction terms were centered
(Aiken& West, 1991).
All analyses rely on weighted data. Sample selection for the
NSFH relied on a complex survey design where selection into
the sample is not independent of other respondents. This can lead
to an underestimation of error variances and covariances. Our use
of sampling weights, strata, and PSUs in the analysis is intended
to reduce this problem. Both the logistic and multinominal logis-
tic regressions were estimated using the complex survey design
methods provided by Stata (Stata, 1997). Specifically, Stata uses
pseudomaximum likelihood estimates for error variances. For
overall modelfit,Wald-F is produced and reported. We also esti-
mated unweighted equations (not shown) and found the error
variances to be smaller in these equations. We decided to follow
the more conservative method and used the weights.
RESULTS
In view of the number of dependent variables and the com-
plexity of findings, we discuss results in conjunction with each
hypothesis (and across the tables) rather than for individual de-
pendent variables. Gender and race interaction terms are not
shown in the tables, but reported throughout the results section.
Race/gender.--Hypothesis 1 posits direct race and gender
effects on retiree self-definitions and on disparity between serf-
definitions and attainment of institutionalized retirement crite-
ria. The results do not confirm the hypothesized race effect, but
provide some support for gender effects. There are no signifi-
cant race X gender interactions. Women are less likely than

men to define themselves as partly, rather than not, retired
(Table 2). Gender also influences disparity between objective
retirement criteria and self-definitions. Women are more prone
than men to reject an identity as full retiree when they are not in
the labor force (Table 3) and to provide serf-definitions that are
incongruent with benefits receipt (Table 4). None of these gen-
der effects is maintained when various life course experiences
and, especially, institutionalized criteria are included in the
models. This suggests that gender differences in the retiree
identity can be attributed to divergent life course experiences
and attainment of institutionalized retirement criteria.
Age.--Age exerts a significant influence on retirement self-
definitions. Persons under institutionalized retirement age tend to
self-define as not retired, whereas those aged 70 and older favor
self-definitions as fully, rather than partly, retired. However, these
effects are only partially maintained when other institutionalized
retirement criteria are controlled (Model 3, Table 2). The age ef-
fects vary somewhat by gender. Specifically, men under age 60
are more prone than women to reject a retiree identity (b=l.79,
p<.0l for fully vs not retired; and £=-1.85, p<.0l for partly ver-
sus fully retired). The data also confirm age effects on disparity
between self-definitions and institutionalized criteria. Disparity
between self-definition and employment is particularly rare
among those aged 70 and older. However, individuals in this age
group are more likely to reject a retiree identity after benefit re-
ceipt, a finding that might indicate persistent rejection of the re-
tiree identity among some individuals. Nevertheless, most indi-

RETIREMENTDEFINITIONS S215
viduals (and men more than women) appear to apply institution-
alized age criteria in their self-definitions.
Life course experiences.--According to Hypothesis 2, life
course experiences should affect the retiree identity, even when
institutionalized retirement criteria are controlled. In addition,
selected life circumstances were predicted to have a greater im-
pact on women than on men (Hypothesis 5). To assess the ef-
fects of life circumstances, we first present a model that ex-
cludes institutionalized retirement criteria and economic
background (Model 2 in all tables), and then discuss the full
models (Model 3 in all tables). Note that selected life circum-
stances with no effect on the dependent variable were dropped
from somefinalmodels.
The data leave little doubt that disability contributes to retiree
self-definitions, as well as to disparity between self-definitions
and institutionalized retirement criteria. Generally, severely dis-
abled persons tend to assume a retiree identity (they are more
likely to define themselves as partly or fully rather than not re-
tired, and as fully, rather than only partly, retired). Except for the
comparison between part and full retirement, these effects are
maintained when institutionalized retirement criteria and other
controls are included in the model. Severe disability also pro-
motes self-definitions as retiree among individuals who cur-
rently receive no benefits, and it discourages self-definitions as
not retired among beneficiaries. However, disparity between
self-definition as retiree and employment status is not contingent
on severe disability. The effects of mild disability differ by race
and gender. Mild disability tends to promote self-definitions as
retired, especially among Blacks (£=1 .82, p<.05 for partly vs
not retired; and b=1.88, p<.05 for full vs not retired) and among
men (b=-l.lS,p<.05). Disparity between self-definitions and
institutionalized criteria is not affected by mild disability.
Marital status also exerts some influence on the retiree iden-
tity. Because several of these effects are confounded with bene-
fit receipt, age, and employment status (as indicated by differ-
ences between Models 2 and 3), we focus on relationships in
Model 3. Widowhood is associated with serf-definitions of not,
rather than partly, or fully, rather than partly, retired, and remar-
ried widows (but not remarried widowers, £=3.89, p<.0l) tend
to self-define as fully, rather than not, retired. In addition, both
widowhood and remarriage after widowhood encourage self-
definitions as not retired among beneficiaries. Never married
individuals are particularly unlikely to self-define as retiree be-
fore benefit receipt, and never married women favor serf-defini-
tions as part, rather than full, retirees (£=2.24, p<.05).
The data provide limited support for effects of fertility history
on retirement definitions. Self-definitions as retiree are less com-
mon among those who delayed childbearing and those with more
children, but these effects are eliminated once institutionalized re-
tirement criteria are included. Delay of childbearing, as well as
having more children, encourages rejection of a retiree identity
among individuals who receive benefits. Number of children born
is more important for rejection of the retiree identity among fe-
male beneficiaries (£=.26,/K.01), and women who delayed child-
bearing are also less likely to self-define as retirees when they are
not employed (£=1.33,/?<.05). This latter relationship is elimi-
nated once institutionalized retirement criteria are controlled.
There is considerable evidence that past work history is re-
flected in the retiree identity. Number of years in the labor force
contributes to the assumption of a retiree identity (partly or
fully, rather than not, retired in Model 3). The significant gen-
der interactions in Model 2 (£=-.06, p<.05 for partly vs fully
retired, and £=.06, p<.0l for fully vs not retired) become non-
significant once the institutionalized retirement criteria are in
the equation. Furthermore, those with longer work histories
tend to self-define as retirees when they are no longer in the
labor force and when they receive benefits.
Recent work disruptions (since Wave 1 of the survey) tend to
encourage self-definitions as partly retired and to discourage an
identity as full retiree. The former effect (partly vs not retired) is
stronger for men (£=-1.34, p<.05), whereas the latter effect (full
vs not retired) is stronger among women (£=-1.27, p<.05).
Neither gender interaction is maintained in Model 3. In addition,
those who experienced work disruptions between waves are less
likely to self-define as retirees when they are not in the labor force.
This effect is more pronounced for men in Model 2 (£=-1.74,
/K.01), though the gender interaction is not significant in Model 3.
Former self-employment has divergent effects on the retiree
identity in Models 2 and 3. When institutionalized criteria are not
controlled (Model 2), self-employment contributes to identifica-
tions as part, rather than full, and as full, rather than not, retired.
Once institutionalized criteria are included, only the former effect
remains significant. Self-employment does not impinge on dis-
parity between self-definitions and attainment of institutionalized
retirement criteria. Education and number of labor force exits
have no influence on self-definitions or disparity.
Overall, these findings substantiate that life circumstances
other than institutionalized retirement criteria impinge on the
retiree identity. Individuals whose life experiences deviate from
institutionalized patterns tend to reject the retiree identity. The
influence of fertility and, to some extent, marital status on the
retiree identity seems to be tied to their relationships to attain-
ment of institutionalized criteria, whereas work history effects
in general and disability effects among African Americans ap-
pear to be relatively independent of such attainments. Family-
related influences (fertility, marital status) play a somewhat
greater role among women, whereas disability and work dis-
ruptions have more of an impact on men's retiree identity.
Institutionalized retirement criteria.--According to Hypothe-
ses 3 and 4, attainment of institutionalized retirement criteria is
expected to enhance self-definitions as retiree and to encourage
congruence between self-definitions and institutionalized retire-
ment criteria. The data lend some support to these hypotheses.
Receipt of Social Security and employer pensions signifi-
cantly contributes to self-definitions as partly or fully retired,
compared with being not retired, and pension receipt also dis-
courages self-definitions of partly, rather than fully, retired. The
effect of pensions varies significantly by gender (£=-1.67,
/?<.01 for partly vs not retired; and £=-1.84,/?<.01 for fully vs
not retired). Receipt of pensions contributes more to men's than
to women's retiree identity. In contrast to Hypothesis 4, pen-
sions did not influence disparity between employment and re-
tiree self-definitions and were dropped from Model 3.
Current labor force participation exerts a strong influence on
self-definitions. Full-time employed individuals tend to assume
an identity as not retired, and they are more likely to see them-
selves as only partly, rather than fully, retired. As might be ex-
pected, part-time employment enhances self-definitions as
S216 SZINOVACZAND DEVINEY
partly, rather than fully, retired, and it also contributes to self-
definitions as not retired, rather than fully retired. The latter ef-
fect is considerably stronger for men than for women (b=-2.60,
p<.05). In addition, employment status impinges on disparity
between benefit receipt and self-definitions. Full-time employ-
ees tend to assume an identity that corresponds with their em-
ployment status rather than their benefit receipt. Specifically,
they are less likely to self-define as retiree when they receive no
benefits and more likely to self-define as partly or not retired,
even when they receive benefits.
Those who lack employment opportunities (job seeking) favor
definitions of part over full retirement, and they are also more likely
to self-define as not retired after receiving benefits. However,
women (b=4.14, p<.0l) who looked for work especially tend to
self-define as retirees before reaching benefit eligibility.
Our results also confirm the notion that spouse's employ-
ment is reflected in the retiree identity. Spouse's retirement in-
creases the probability of self-defining as fully, rather than
partly or not, retired. Furthermore, spouse's retirement con-
tributes to self-definition as retiree among persons who do not
receive benefits. Contrary to our expectations, these relation-
ships do not vary by gender. On the other hand, spouse's retire-
ment reduces the likelihood of disparity between self-definition
and labor force participation. Individuals with retired spouses
tend to adopt a retiree identity when they are not in the labor
force, and this trend is more pronounced for women than men
(b=-l.lS,p<.01). While spouse's retirement has relatively con-
sistent effects on retirement definitions, spouse's pensions have
only a marginal impact. Those whose spouses receive pensions
are particularly unlikely to self-define as retirees without re-
ceiving benefits themselves.
Generally, thesefindingsindicate that institutionalized retire-
ment criteria have been internalized and serve as strong anchor
points for individuals' self-definition as retiree. Moreover, the
effects of institutionalized criteria are additive, that is, attain-
ment of specific institutionalized retirement criteria contributes
to the retiree identity, even when fulfillment of other criteria is
controlled. Pensions and attainment of institutionalized retire-
ment age contribute more to men's than women's retiree iden-
tity, whereas lackingjob opportunities and spouse's retirement
tend to further disparity between women's self-definitions and
their attainment of institutionalized criteria.
Economic status.--Variables considered under economic
background are respondent's income, spouse's income, and re-
ceipt of public assistance. Neither income nor spouse's income
influence self-definitions as retiree, though respondents' in-
come has some effect on disparity. Respondents with higher in-
comes are more likely to assume a retiree identity when they
leave the labor force. In addition, self-definitions as retiree
among individuals who are not beneficiaries become less com-
mon as income increases. This latter effect applies foremost to
men (gender interaction b=33,p<.05).
Current receipt of public assistance relates significantly to re-
tiree self-definitions, as well as to disparity between self-defini-
tions and selected institutionalized retirement criteria.
Recipients of public assistance are less likely to self-define as
partly, rather than either not retired at all or fully retired. Self-
definition as partly, rather than not, retired is particularly un-
common among men (b=2.92, p<.05), whereas female public
assistance recipients are more likely than their male counter-
parts to identify as fully, rather than not, retired (b=2.96, p<.0\).
In addition, women who receive public assistance are less prone
than men to describe themselves as not retired once they re-
ceive Social Security or pensions (b=-3.14,p<.05).
Overall, economic status plays a relatively minor role in retire-
ment self-definitions. Among men, economic achievements ap-
pear to reinforce self-identification in line with institutionalized
criteria, whereas women on public assistance favor a retiree
identity.
CONCLUSION
This study's focus on the retiree identity complements earlier
research that centered foremost on objective or institutionalized
retirement criteria. We conceptualize retirement self-identifica-
tion as a complex process which reflects potential tensions be-
tween individuals' own life circumstances and experiences on
the one hand, and the expectations derived from institutional-
ized retirement programs and policies on the other hand (Kohli,
1986). Such tensions were expected to derive from differences
between public and private retirement criteria (Social Security
vs employer pensions), from blurred or nonvoluntary labor
force exits, and from experiences that diverge from the life
course implied in institutionalized retirement programs and pre-
dominate among minorities and women. They should manifest
themselves in the extent to which individuals assume a retiree
identity and in the overlap between self-definitions and attain-
ment of institutionalized retirement criteria.
Thefindingsconfirm that institutionalized retirement criteria
serve as foundation for individuals' self-definition as retiree
(Ekerdt et al., 1994; Setterstein & Hagestad, 1996). Even
though all criteria (employment status, pension receipt, Social
Security income, and attainment of institutionalized retirement
age) independently contribute to the retiree identity, employ-
ment status apparently takes precedence over other criteria. Not
only is the association between employment and self-identifica-
tion as retiree stronger than the relationships between the retiree
identity and other institutionalized criteria, but employment sta-
tus also promotes self-definitions as retiree when other retire-
ment criteria are not met. Moreover, the extent of individuals'
employment is clearly reflected in their self-identifications.
Because institutionalized programs imply a family wage, we
further expected that spouses' retirement or pensions would
contribute to the retiree identity. The results confirm especially
the effect of spouses' retirement on self-identifications (which
covary strongly with spouses' employment status), suggesting
perhaps a "couple retiree identity" among married individuals.
Incongruence between public and private criteria seems to
play only a minor role in retirement self-identification pro-
cesses. More important for the retiree identity are labor force
exits that are not clearly demarcated or involuntary. The self-
employed, as well as "discouraged" workers (those looking for
jobs after their last employment), tend to describe themselves
as partly, rather than fully, retired. Financial attainments tend to
encourage self-definitions as retiree foremost among men.
There is consistent evidence that disability influences the retiree
identity. Contrary to our expectations, disability tends to promote
self-definitions as retiree. For mild disability, this tendency pre-
vails among Blacks and men. The race differences especially con-
tradict earlier research. Closer comparison between previous re-
RETIREMENTDEFINITIONS S217
search (Gibson, 1987,1993) and our findings suggests that ques-
tion wording may be responsible for the divergent results. The
NSFH question asks respondents whether they consider them-
selves retired and provides a forced choice among full, partly, or
not retired with no differentiation within the "not retired" cate-
gory, whereas in the National Survey of BlackAmericans used by
Gibson (1987) "respondents were asked to explain why they were
not working. The eightfixedchoices were homemaker, physically
disabled, welfare, student, retired, transportation problems, cannot
find ajob, and do not wish ajob" (p. 694). It is conceivable that
the latter question evokes responses that refer to reasons for retire-
ment rather than to the retiree identity itself. On the other hand,
the NSFH may encourage self-definitions as retiree because it
does not provide the option to identify as disabled. Because
Blacks are more likely to retire for health reasons (Hayward et al.,
1996), they may be more likely than Whites to indicate "disabled"
as their main reason for not working, rather than choosing "re-
tired," which may be associated with an expected and voluntary
retirement transition. We suggest that identification with the re-
tiree role among disabled workers carries greater psychological
benefits than identification with a sick role. Retirement is a so-
cially sanctioned role, and early retirement has become an ac-
cepted life choice, whereas a long-term sick role is not socially
sanctioned and may have particularly negative connotations
among older persons ("old and sick"). Within this context it is also
understandable that mildly disabled women are less likely to iden-
tify with a retiree role than men with similar health limitations--
the role of housewife (not retired and not in the labor force) may
be seen as more acceptable than that of early and involuntary re-
tiree. Given the small frequencies, especially for minorities, these
conclusions clearly warrant further substantiation.
Past employment experiences exert a significant influence on the
retiree identity. Work histories thatfitthe expectation of life-long
work with few disruptions apparently render the retirement transi-
tion less ambiguous and promote acceptance of the retiree role.
We further hypothesized that life experiences other than work
history and spouses' retirement or benefit status would influence
the retiree identity, especially among women. Support for this
hypothesis is very weak. While marital status and fertility his-
tory exert some influence on selected dependent variables, these
effects are often inconsistent, and in some cases more pro-
nounced, for men than women. The only finding in line with the
expected gender differences is that high fertility enhances rejec-
tion of the retiree identity among women beneficiaries. The
overall trend implied in the gender differences is that men's,
compared with women's, retiree identity is more stronglytiedto
their own attainments of institutionalized retirement criteria and
of a continuous and successful work career. This would suggest
moreflexibilityin women's retiree identity according to a vari-
ety of circumstances; a finding which is consistent with the in-
tent, though not the specific predictions of, Hypothesis 2.
Our data have implications both for measurement and theoret-
ical approaches to retirement research. They support the empha-
sis on labor force participation, rather than age or benefits, as the
main criterion used in retirement research. However, some incon-
gruence between self-definitions and institutionalized retirement
criteria occur among part-time and self-employed individuals,
and both conditions may have somewhat different connotations
for women and men. Thus, future research needs to explore under
what circumstances part-time and self-employed workers should
be classified as workers or as retirees, or for whom part- and self-
employment constitutes a "bridge job." In addition, researchers
will need to keep in mind that institutionalized retirement criteria
contain somewhat of a White, middle-class, male bias. Thefitbe-
tween institutionalized criteria and self-definitions is best for men
with continuous and successful work careers. Our results indicate
that the influence of selected life circumstances differs by gender
and race, and that some of these gender and race interactions are
maintained when institutionalized retirement criteria, work histo-
ries, and economic status are in the equations. It is conceivable
that gender and race affect the importance of the work role in in-
dividuals' lives, but further research on the reasons for race and
gender differences in retirement definitions is clearly indicated
(see also Honig, 1996; Quinn & Kozy, 1996; Santiago &
Muschkin, 1996). For example, future research should address
questions such as: Does rejection of the retiree identity among
those who meet selected institutionalized retirement criteria (or
self-definition as retiree among those who do not meet these cri-
teria) have divergent consequences for the self-image, attitudes,
or behaviors of men and women, or of African Americans and
Whites? Can retirement programs and policies appeal to or be
successful among individuals who do not follow the life course
implied in traditional programs and policies?
Future research is also essential to determine how question
and answer categories affect findings concerning retirement sta-
tus and retiree identity. Our results on disability suggest that re-
tirement reasons and retirement self-identifications may di-
verge, and our overall findings suggest that the retiree identity
is not always synonymous with attainment of institutionalized
retirement criteria. Whether and to what extent these differ-
ences influence results concerning the predictors and conse-
quences of retirement remains unclear. For example, predictors
and consequences of labor force exits may diverge among
women who define their labor force withdrawal as a transition
from employment to housewife, and those who perceive it as a
transition from employment to retiree.
More generally, our research underlines the need to couch
retirement transition processes within a theoretical perspective
that is sensitive to differences, not only in life experiences them-
selves, but also in their consequences for and interpretation by
divergent societal subgroups. Focusing more research on the re-
tiree identity may help clarify the meaning context of retire-
ment and, thereby, contribute to enhanced concept validity and
theoretical advancement in studies of retirement transitions.
