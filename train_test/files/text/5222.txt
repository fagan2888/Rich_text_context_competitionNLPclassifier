Abstract
In peripheral nerves, P0 glycoprotein accounts for more than 20% of myelin protein content. P0 is synthesized by Schwann
cells, processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and enters the secretory pathway. However, the mutant P0 with S63
deleted (P0S63del) accumulates in the ER lumen and induces a demyelinating neuropathy in Charcot­Marie­Tooth disease
type 1B (CMT1B)­S63del mice. Accumulation of P0S63del in the ER triggers a persistent unfolded protein response. Protein
kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) is an ER stress sensor that phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor
2 alpha (eIF2alpha) in order to attenuate protein synthesis. We have shown that increasing phosphophorylated-eIF2alpha (P-
eIF2alpha) is a potent therapeutic strategy, improving myelination and motor function in S63del mice. Here, we explore the
converse experiment: Perk haploinsufficiency reduces P-eIF2alpha in S63del nerves as expected, but surprisingly, ameliorates,
rather than worsens S63del neuropathy. Motor performance and myelin abnormalities improved in S63del//Perkþ/À com-
pared with S63del mice. These data suggest that mechanisms other than protein translation might be involved in CMT1B/
S63del neuropathy. In addition, Perk deficiency in other cells may contribute to demyelination in a non­Schwann-cell autono-
mous manner.

Introduction
The peripheral nervous system (PNS) consists mainly of
neurons and Schwann cells. Schwann cells produce myelin,
which is a membranous structure composed by lipids and
proteins that allows fast nerve conduction. The myelin pro-
tein zero gene (P0, MPZ) encodes the major protein con-
stituent of myelin. Mutations affecting MPZ cause a wide
array of hereditary neuropathies. In particular, deletion of
serine 63 from P0 (P0S63del) causes Charcot­Marie­Tooth
disease type 1B (CMT1B) neuropathy characterized by
reduced motor capacity, defective nerve conduction, and
demyelination (Kulkens et al., 1993; Miller et al., 2012).
Analysis of transgenic mice expressing this mutation
revealed that P0S63del fails to reach myelin and is
retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of Schwann

cells (Wrabetz et al., 2006; Pennuto et al., 2008). The
accumulation of P0S63del triggers the unfolded protein
response (UPR), a set of signals aimed to restore cellular
homeostasis (Schroder and Kaufman, 2005). Schwann
cells and neurons are examples of factory cells; both
face a high demand for protein synthesis and folding,
rendering them particularly vulnerable to ER stress
(D'Antonio et al., 2009; Gow and Wrabetz,
2009; Matus et al., 2011). If balance is not restored, term-
inal-phase UPR effectors may provoke cell death or
dedifferentiation (Tabas and Ron, 2011; D'Antonio
et al., 2013).
In mammals, there are three UPR transducers: Protein
kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK),
activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-
requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). IRE1 activates, through
spliced X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1s) transcription
factor, the expression of genes involved in ER-associated
degradation (ERAD; Friedlander et al., 2000; Travers
et al., 2000). ATF6 promotes folding capacity by increas-
ing the levels of ER-resident chaperones (Haze et al.,
1999; Yoshida et al., 2000; Yoshida et al., 2001; Shen
et al., 2002; Yamamoto et al., 2007). PERK represses
translation of most messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by phos-
phorylating eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha
(eIF2alpha), hence reducing the load of proteins in the
ER lumen. Phosphorylated-eukaryotic initiation factor 2
alpha (P-eIF2alpha) protects and promotes survival in
factory cells. In fact, the ability to cope with persistent
ER stress is significantly decreased in Perk-deficient
cells (Harding et al., 2001b; P. Zhang et al., 2002a).
P-eIF2alpha simultaneously increases the translation of
activating transcripton factor 4 (ATF4) that upregulates
CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous gene
(Chop), an effector of cell death or dedifferentiation
(Zinszner et al., 1998; Harding et al., 2000a; Tsang
et al., 2007; Pennuto et al., 2008; D'Antonio et al.,
2013). In S63del mice, genetic ablation of Chop rescued
motor function and reduced demyelination (Pennuto
et al., 2008). CHOP aggravates S63del neuropathy by
upregulating growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible
protein 34 gene (Gadd34), encoding a regulatory subunit
of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) holophosphatase that
reactivates protein translation via dephosphorylation
of eIF2alpha.
We previously demonstrated that Gadd34 inactiva-
tion rescued S63del neuropathy by augmenting the
level of P-eIF2alpha and, therefore, reducing protein
synthesis and overload in the ER, and alleviating the
UPR (D'Antonio et al., 2013). Thus, we reasoned that
reduced phosphorylation of eIF2alpha would exacer-
bate S63del neuropathy. Nonetheless, we show here
that Perk haploinsufficiency surprisingly ameliorates
S63del myelin defects in vivo and in vitro, even if nerve
levels of P-eIF2alpha were decreased. Moreover, Perk
ablation improved motor capacity in S63del mice indi-
cating that PERK is detrimental in CMT1B neuropathy.
Our data indicate that improved S63del neuropathy
is not always coupled to increased P-eIF2alpha levels
in nerve.
Materials and Methods
Animals
All experiments involving animals were performed in
accord with experimental protocols approved by the
San Raffaele Scientific Institute Animal Care and Use
Committee. S63del-L and S63del-H (hereafter, S63del
and S63del-H) transgenic mice (129.4 and 129.1 lines,
60% and 210% overexpression of P0S63del, respectively;
Wrabetz et al., 2006), P0-overexpressing (P0OE) mice
(80.4 line; Wrabetz et al., 2000), and Perk-null mice
(Harding et al., 2000b) have been described previously.
P0S63del and P0OE were maintained on the FVB/N
background, whereas Perkþ/À mice, initially on the
129S6 background, were backcrossed for at least six gen-
erations onto the FVB/N background before initiation of
experiments. S63del mice were crossed with Perkþ/À
mice in order to obtain wildtype (WT), S63del, Perkþ/
À, and S63del//Perkþ/À genotypes. P0S63del transgene
was detected in FVB background mice through Tg80
PCR, with the following primer sequences: P0 sense
(50-GAGATGCCATTTCGGTGAGT-30) and P0 anti-
sense (50-GCTATTTGCCCTTCTCAGTC-30). Following
digestion with BamH1 restriction endonucleases, two
bands are recognized for the positive pups; 310 bp
(cut) þ 400 bp. To detect the Perk KO allele, the following
primers were used; PGK.255R (50-GCTACCGGTG
GATGTGGAATGTG-30), PERK.i6AS (50-CGGAG
ACAGTACAAGCGCAGATGA-30), and mPERK1730S
(50-AAGGACCCTATCCTCCTGCTGCAC-30). Expected
bands were 230bp (wt), 300bp (null allele; Harding et al.,
2000b). In all experiments, littermates were used as
controls.
PERK Immunoprecipitation
Where indicated, WT mice were injected intraperitoneally
with 1mg of tunicamycin in 150mM dextrose/g body
weight. Mice were killed by CO2
inhalation after 48hr.
Fragments of livers from WT or injected animals and a
total number of 40 to 50 sciatic nerves from each of WT,
S63del, S63del-H, and P0-OE mice at postnatal day 28
(P28) were harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Tissues were pulverized in a stainless steel mortar at
À80C, and the powder was homogenized with a motorized
Teflon pestle with 1ml of SDS-free buffer (1% Triton
X100, 150mM NaCl, 20mM Hepes pH 7.5, 10% glycerol,
1mM EDTA) containing phosphatase (1X, Phostop,
2 ASN Neuro
Roche) and protease inhibitors (PIC, Sigma). The hom-
ogenate was centrifuged twice at 14,000rpm at 4C, and
protein concentration was assessed by the BCA method
(Pierce). An equal amount of lysate (2 mg for nerves
and 4mg for liver) was diluted to a final volume of
700ml for each sample. For nerves, 20ml were reserved
for Western analysis to normalize the amount of protein.
Saturation of endogenous immunoglobulins and aspecific
binding were prevented by adding 50ml of protein A beads
(GE-Healthcare) and 1ml of a nonspecific rabbit antibody
to lysates and incubating for 1hr at 4C. Lysates were
centrifuged and beads discarded. Rabbit polyclonal sera
(2ml) against PERK (or subsequently against general con-
trol nonderepressible 2 (GCN2), heme-regulated eIF2
alpha kinase (HRI), or protein kinase RNA (PKR)
were added together with 50 ml of protein A beads to
each sample and left rotating overnight at 4C. After cen-
trifugation at 14,000rpm for 10min, the PERK-containing
beads were washed and the excess of washing solution
was eliminated with a 27 G needle. Laemmli buffer was
added (15­20ml), and beads were boiled for 5min
and loaded onto a 6% to 7% SDS-PAGE gel for
Western analysis.
Western Analysis
Sciatic nerves from transgenic and WT animals were dis-
sected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Proteins were
extracted in 100 ml of SDS Lysis Buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.4, 95 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 2% SDS) with
phosphatase (final 1X, Phostop, Roche) and protease
inhibitors (final 1X, PIC, Sigma). Protein content was
assessed by the BCA method (Pierce) following manufac-
turer's instructions. Total proteins (10­40 mg) were
resolved by 6­12% SDS-PAGE under denaturing condi-
tions as previously described (Wrabetz et al., 2000).
Mouse monoclonal antibodies recognized beta-tubulin
(1:2,000; Sigma­Aldrich), eIF2alpha (L57A5, Cell
Signaling, 1:1,000), and calnexin (1:500). Rabbit mono-
clonal antibodies recognized P-eIF2alpha (119A11, Cell
Signaling, 1:500). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies recog-
nized binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP; Novus
Biologicals, 1:1,000), Gadd34 (10449-1-AP, Proteintech,
1:500) ATF4 (sc-200, Santa Cruz, 1:500), ATF6 (1:100),
PKR (D-20, Santa Cruz, 1:500), P-Thr446-PKR
(ab32036, Abcam, 1:500), and HRI (07-728, Millipore,
1:1,000). Rabbit poly-sera against PERK (1:1,000),
GCN2 (1:1,000), and P-Thr898-GCN2 (1:500) were the
generous gift of David Ron (Cambridge, UK). Suitable
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2,000­1:5,000)
were visualized by ECL or ECL Plus (Pierce) in autoradi-
ography (GE-Healthcare). Alternatively, rabbit or mouse
800CW/600CW IRDye conjugated antibodies (LI-COR;
1:5000) were revealed with the Odyssey 2.0 scanner
(LI-COR).
Behavioral, Electrophysiological, and
Morphological Analyses
Motor capacity was assessed in 4-month-old mice
by rotarod analysis, as described previously (Wrabetz
et al., 2006) testing 16 to 23 animals/genotype.
Electrophysiology was performed as previously described
(Wrabetz et al., 2006), on five mice/genotype at 4 months
of age (both sciatic nerves). An equal number of male and
female animals were used to perform behavioral and elec-
trophysiological analyses. The number of onion bulbs
and demyelinated fibers were counted blind to genotype
in toluidine blue­stained semi-thin sections in sciatic
nerves of 12-month-old animals. A total of 42 to
64 fields were captured from three to four animals/
genotype using a 100Â objective. The measure of
g-ratio was obtained as previously described using
Qwin3 semi-automated system (Leica Microsystems;
Pennuto et al., 2008). A total of 2,000 to 3,000 myelinated
fibers obtained from four microscopic fields/nerve from
three animals/genotype were analyzed.
In-Vivo Internodal Length Evaluation
Femoral quadriceps nerves at P10 or P20 were fixed for
1 hr at room temperature in a 1% osmium-tetroxide/
0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) solution. Nerves were
then washed twice and left at 50C for three overnight
periods in ascending 60%, 80%, or 100% glycerol/0.1 M
phosphate buffer (pH7.4) solutions. Single nerve fibers
were teased from nerves with G27 syringe needles under
a microscope, and brightfield images of at least 111 to 182
internodes (three animals/genotype) were measured with
ImageJ software.
Immunohistochemistry
Brain, cerebellum, and muscle were dissected from P28
mice and fixed in 10% formalin buffer overnight at room
temperature. The sections were embedded in paraffin,
and 4 -mm sections were cut and dried at 60C for 1 hr.
Slides were cooled to room temperature, deparaffinized
in three changes of xylene, and rehydrated using graded
alcohols. Finally, the slides were stained with hematoxy-
lin and eosin, rinsed with water, and coverslipped.
Fresh frozen P28 sciatic nerve sections (8­10 mm) were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min and
permeabilized with À20C cold methanol for 5 min.
Blocking was performed for 30 min in undiluted goat
serum followed by a 45-min incubation with
bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (BSA) 1%­Triton 0.2% in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Rabbit anti-CHOP
(1:200, gift of Alex Gow) and rat anti-myelin basic pro-
tein (MBP; 1:4, gift of Judith Grinspan) were incubated
overnight in BSA 1%­Triton 0.2% in PBS. Suitable
Musner et al. 3
secondary antibodies (1:100­300) were then incubated
for 1 hr. Sections were then washed, exposed to 40,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:10,000) and mounted in
VectaShield medium (Vector Labs). To assess the nuclear
localization of CHOP, confocal images were taken using
Leica confocal SP2 microscope with the 60Â objective.
Staining of myelinated cultures was performed at 12 days
after ascorbic acid induction. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG)
neurons were fixed with ice-cold 4% PFA for 15 min and
permeabilized for 5 min with À20C cold methanol.
Coverslips were moved to a wet chamber and blocked
with 10% donkey serum in PBS for 1 hr. Rat antibody
against MBP (1:4, Judith Grinspan) and rabbit antibody
against NF-H (1:200, EMD Millipore) were incubated
overnight at 4C in BSA 1%­Triton 0.2%. Anti-rabbit
FITC-conjuated (1:200, Jackson Immuno Research Labs)
and DyLight 549-conjugated anti-rat antibodies (1:800)
were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Coverslips
were then exposed to DAPI and mounted as before. Only
the areas where neurofilament staining (axons) was pre-
sent were considered for counting. Coverslips were visua-
lized on a DM5000B fluorescence microscope (Leica),
images captured with a Leica DFC480 digital color
camera and processed with Adobe Photoshop CS4. The
internodal length was measured with ImageJ software.
Myelinating DRG Explant Cultures and Cocultures
DRG from E13.5 WT, Perkþ/À, PerkÀ/À, S63del,
S63del//Perkþ/À and S63del//Perkþ/À embryos were
cultured as previously described (Taveggia et al., 2005).
After 6 days in culture, myelination was induced with
50 mg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma­Aldrich) and the number
of myelinated segments was assessed after 12 days upon
addition of ascorbic acid. Pure DRG neuronal cultures
were obtained as previously described (Taveggia et al.,
2005) using three 2-day cycles of normal or FudR­sup-
plemented media. Rat Schwann cells (2 Â 105) were
seeded on pure neuronal cultures and left to recover
for 6 days. Afterward, Schwann cells were induced to
myelinate with 50 mg/ml ascorbic acid in culture
media and blocked at 21 days after seeding for assess-
ment. Parallel, non-seeded neuronal cultures certified
absence of mouse Schwann cells. The number and
length of MBP-positive myelinated internodes (see
Immunohistochemistry section) was counted from 8 to
10 fields per DRG and from 8 to 12 DRG per embryo.
Three to nine embryos per genotype were dissected in
four separate experiments.
TaqManÕ Quantitative PCR Analysis
Total RNA from mouse P28 sciatic nerves was extracted
using TRIzol (Roche), as previously described (Pennuto
et al., 2008). Synthesis of cDNA was performed starting
from 2 mg of total RNA using a final concentration of
50 mg/ml oligo dT (Promega), 5 mg/ml random hexamers
(Promega), 2.5 mM dNTPs (Invitrogen), 30 U RNAsin
(Promega), 0.02 M DDT, and 200 U Superscript-II
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture
was incubated for 1 hr at 42C. A 1:50 dilution of
cDNA was prepared and 4 ml was used to perform
the quantitative PCR. The ABI PRISM 7700 sequence
detection system (Applied Biosystems Instruments)
was used for the amplification according to the manufac-
turer's instructions (TaqManÕ; Applied Biosystems).
The relative standard curve method was applied using
WT mice as reference. Normalization was per-
formed using 18 S rRNA. Target and reference ampli-
fications were performed in separate wells with
TaqManÕ Assays on Demand (Life Technologies): 18 S,
Hs99999901_s1; Chop, Mm00492097_m1; Myd116/
Gadd34, Mm00435119_m1; Atf4, Mm00515324_m1;
Xbp-1 s, Mm03464496_m1.
Statistical Analysis
In every experiment, at least three biological replicates
were analyzed. To determine the significance between
WT and S63del or S63del and S63del//Perkþ/À
Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) were used. p .05 was considered statistically
significant. Graphical data are represented as
mean Æ SEM.
Results
The UPR initiates when misfolded proteins accumulate in
the ER (Ron and Walter, 2007). Cells induce transla-
tional attenuation as a fast and efficient strategy to pre-
vent the accumulation of client proteins in the ER and
cope with stress (Harding et al., 2001a). Complex eukary-
otes achieve global attenuation of protein translation by
activating the PERK P-eIF2alpha pathway (Harding
et al., 2001a). Misfolded P0S63del accumulates in the
ER of Schwann cells, eliciting a chronic UPR that
causes CMT1B neuropathy (Wrabetz et al., 2006;
Pennuto et al., 2008). Indeed, genetic and pharmaco-
logical inhibition of Gadd34 in S63del mice resulted in
increased levels of P-eIF2alpha, lowered the rates of pro-
tein synthesis, and rescued the S63del phenotype
(D'Antonio et al., 2013). To understand if, on the con-
trary, reduced eIF2alpha phosphorylation would worsen
S63del neuropathy, we bred S63del mice with Perkþ/À
mice, where PERK-dependent phosphorylation of
eIF2alpha is impaired (Harding et al., 2001b).
Unfortunately, we could not study nerves from full
Perk ablation because PerkÀ/À mice invariably died
soon after birth in the FVB/NCrl background (Harding
et al., 2001a).
4 ASN Neuro
Perk is Necessary for eIF2alpha Phosphorylation
in S63del Nerves
To test PERK activation in the CMT1B mouse model, we
analyzed the levels of P-eIF2alpha in S63del nerves
between postnatal day 10 (P10) and 4 months of age.
The phosphorylation of eIF2alpha was high in S63del
nerves compared with WT between P10 and P30
(Figure 1a). Similar to P-eIF2alpha, also the chaperone
BiP, a marker of ER stress, was highly induced in S63del
nerves between P10 and P30, suggesting that P10­P30,
when P0S63del is highly synthesized causing a chronic
UPR, was a good timeframe for directly testing PERK
activation.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis
allowed us to distinguish the active, phosphorylated
form of PERK (PERK*), from the inactive counterpart
(PERK0) in P30 sciatic nerves (Figure 1b­c). Liver
extracts derived from tunicamycin-injected mice served
as positive controls (Figure 1b). In accordance with P-
eIF2alpha levels, also PERK activation (PERK*)
increased in a dose-dependent manner in S63del and
S63del-H nerves (60% and 210% overexpression of
MpzS63del, respectively; Wrabetz et al., 2006) as com-
pared with WT at P30. Interestingly, also P0OE nerves
(80% overexpression; Wrabetz et al., 2000), showed
increased PERK activation (Figure 1c), although full
activation of a canonical UPR has not been detected in
P0OE nerves (Pennuto et al., 2008; D'Antonio et al.,
2013). Furthermore, the activation of the other three
eIF2alpha kinases, GCN2, HRI, and PKR (Harding
et al., 1999; Harding et al., 2000a; F. Zhang et al.,
2001; P. Zhang et al., 2002b), was not significant in
S63del nerves (Supplementary Figure 1) suggesting that
PERK is the main eIF2alpha kinase active in S63del-
CMT1B nerves. Consistent with these observations,
Perk partial loss of function in S63del mice (S63del//
Perkþ/À) was sufficient to reduce P-eIF2alpha by
roughly 40% in S63del nerves at P28 (Figure 1d). We
conclude that PERK is the main kinase involved in
eIF2alpha phosphorylation in vivo, and that we can
experimentally explore the consequences of reduced
P-eIF2alpha levels in the context of the UPR in S63del
nerves.
Perk Haploinsufficiency Paradoxically Ameliorates
S63del Motor Performance and Reduces
Demyelination and Onion Bulbs
S63del mice display a progressive neuropathy character-
ized by impairment in motor capacity that can be
detected by rotarod analysis around 4 months of age
(Wrabetz et al., 2006; Pennuto et al., 2008; D'Antonio
et al., 2013). The rotarod test of motor performance
also successfully discriminated functional changes of
S63del neuropathy in previous studies where the UPR
was genetically perturbed (Pennuto et al., 2008;
D'Antonio et al., 2013). Thus, to test whether Perk abla-
tion would have a detrimental effect on S63del motor
function, as expected from a resulting decrease in P-
eIF2alpha, we performed rotarod analysis on WT,
Perkþ/À, S63del, and S63del//Perkþ/À mice at 4
months of age. Surprisingly, S63del//Perkþ/À animals
showed a significant improvement in motor performance
as compared with S63del mice (Figure 2a). Supporting
the rotarod data, in S63del//Perkþ/À mice F-wave
latency showed a trend toward amelioration as compared
with S63del (p ¼ .10; Figure 2c), however, nerve conduc-
tion velocity (NCV) was not improved (Figure 2b).
Notably, Perkþ/À mice showed reduced motor cap-
acity, although NCV and F-wave latency were not signifi-
cantly affected, suggesting a possible detrimental effect of
Perk haploinsufficiency in tissues other than sciatic nerve
that could affect the motor performance (Figure 2b­c). To
verify this hypothesis, we performed morphological ana-
lysis of cerebellum, spinal cord, and gastrocnemius muscle
(Supplementary Figures 2­4). Hematoxylin and eosin
staining did not reveal gross abnormalities in the cerebel-
lum and spinal cord suggesting that these tissues did not
contribute to the reduced motor capacity of Perkþ/À
mice. Interestingly, Perkþ/À mice displayed a trend
toward a slightly increased number of centrally nucleated
muscle fibers as compared with WT (Supplementary
Figure 4a, inset a, black arrowheads), although a similar
1­2% of centrally nucleated fibers have been reported in
WT mouse muscle (Sonnemann et al., 2006) suggesting
that this slight increase is unlikely to explain significantly
impaired rotarod performance.
Finally, metabolic diseases like diabetes mellitus are
associated with neuropathy. Perkþ/À mice have been
reported to manifest glucose intolerance with only
slightly elevated beta-islet cell death (Harding et al.,
2001b). Accordingly, we found no obvious morphological
difference in hematoxylin and eosin­stained pancreatic
islets among WT, Perkþ/À, S63del, and S63del//Perkþ/
À mice (data not shown).
S63del neuropathy is characterized by thinner myelin
(hypomyelination; Pennuto et al., 2008; D'Antonio et al.,
2013). We therefore investigated the effect of Perk loss of
function in S63del nerves and quantified myelin thickness
at 4 months. As expected, the g-ratio analysis revealed
hypomyelination in S63del nerves compared with WT
(0.69 Æ 0.002 vs. 0.65 Æ 0.002, p < .001; Figure 2e and
f), but did not reveal a difference between S63del//Perkþ/
À and S63del nerves (Figure 2f). A very slight hypermye-
lination was instead detected in Perkþ/À nerves when
compared with WT (0.63 Æ 0.002 vs. 0.65 Æ 0.002,
p < .001; Figure 2e).
After 6 months of age, S63del nerves show progressive
signs of demyelination and other pathological hallmarks,
Musner et al. 5
such as onion bulbs (Wrabetz et al., 2006). As previously
reported, Chop ablation and the functional impairment of
Gadd34 reduced the amount of demyelinated fibers and
onion bulbs in S63del animals (Pennuto et al., 2008;
D'Antonio et al., 2013). To further analyze the unex-
pected finding that Perk deficiency could rescue S63del
neuropathy, we counted the number of demyelinating
fibers and onion bulbs at 12 months, when they are
more evident. Strikingly, both onion bulbs and
demyelinated fibers were strongly diminished in
S63del//Perkþ/À sciatic nerves as compared to S63del
(Figure 3). Only rare pathological findings were detected
in Perkþ/À and WT nerves. Consistent with this
improvement, Perk deficiency in S63del produced a
trend toward amelioration of the reduced myelin thick-
ness observed in S63del compared with WT, as shown by
g-ratio measurement in 12-month sciatic nerves
(Supplementary Figure 5). Taken together, these data

Amelioration of S63del Neuropathy does not
Depend on Perk Deficiency in Neurons
Neither the worsening of Perkþ/À motor performance,
nor the amelioration of myelination in S63del//Perkþ/À
nerves was associated with obvious effects in the
nervous system outside of peripheral nerve. Therefore,
to investigate the effects further in nerve, we analyzed
Perk ablation in nerve cells. We isolated myelinating
DRG explants from E13.5 embryos. Importantly, since
Perk null embryos are still viable at this stage, we could
also test the full Perk ablation.
Consistent with what we had observed in vivo in sci-
atic nerves, P-eIF2alpha levels were higher in S63del
explants as compared with WT, and they decreased in

internodes when compared with S63del (Figure 4b­d).
The reduced number of myelinated segments in Perkþ/
À and PerkÀ/À as well as S63del DRG explants could
not be explained by a diminished amount of Schwann
cells or by a reduced number of axons because DAPI
and neurofilament staining showed equal density of
nuclei and of axons in all genotypes (data not shown).
To analyze whether this modulation of myelination
was neuron cell-autonomous, we isolated mouse DRG
explants from WT, Perkþ/À and PerkÀ/À embryos,
depleted them of endogenous Schwann cells and seeded
them with WT rat Schwann cells. In this way, only DRG
neurons are lacking Perk, as the rat Schwann cells are
WT. To control for possible insertional effects of
S63del transgene, we also processed analogously S63del,
S63del//Perkþ/À, and S63del//Perkþ/À explants. The
number of myelinated internodes and internodal length
were unaffected in all of the explants, showing that nei-
ther the depletion of Perk in neurons nor S63del trans-
gene insertion had an effect on Schwann-cell myelination
(Figure 4e­g). These data suggest that Perk ablation has
an important role in influencing myelination in S63del
DRG explants and that Schwann cells might be primarily
responsible for this effect.
To confirm the ex vivo observations in vivo, we mea-
sured the internodal length of teased fibers from WT,
Perkþ/À, S63del, and S63del//Perkþ/À sciatic nerves.
Internodal length increases strongly between P5 and
P20 and reaches its maximum around P30, when it sta-
bilizes (Court et al., 2004). In agreement with what we
found in the myelinating DRG explant cultures, S63del
internodes are shorter than those in the WT. In addition,
S63del//Perkþ/À teased fibers show longer internodes
than S63del between P10 and P20 (Figure 5a and b).
To further support the in vivo data on S63del//Perkþ/À
myelination, we quantified the protein expression of
MAG, MBP, and PMP22 myelin proteins in 4-month
nerves. Western blot analysis showed a reduction in
MBP levels in S63del nerves relative to WT, whereas
levels of myelin-related proteins remained similar
between S63del and S63del//Perkþ/À (Supplementary
Figure 6). As demyelination and onion bulbs occur in a
small subset of fibers in S63del nerves, it is possible that
these morphological features do not produce discernible
effects in western analysis for myelin proteins.
Nonetheless, our observations reinforce that, both
in vivo and ex vivo, S63del myelination is ameliorated
by Perk genetic ablation.

Amelioration of the S63del//Perkþ/À Phenotype is
not Dependent on Chop Loss-of-Function
The amelioration that we observed in S63del//Perkþ/À
mice closely resembles that detected in S63del//ChopÀ/À
mice: S63del//ChopÀ/À animals also showed rescued
motor capacity, improved F-wave latency and a reduc-
tion in demyelinated fibers (Pennuto et al., 2008). The
transcription factor ATF4 lies between P-eIF2alpha and
CHOP in the PERK signaling pathway. As P-eIF2alpha
levels are reduced in S63del//Perkþ/À nerves, stress-
enhanced translation of ATF4 may be limited, reducing
upregulation of Chop and its detrimental effect on mye-
lination. To test this hypothesis, we measured ATF4 pro-
tein levels in sciatic nerves of P28 animals. Surprisingly,
ATF4 is not decreased in S63del//Perkþ/À nerves as
compared with S63del (Figure 6a). Accordingly, Chop
mRNA is still highly induced in S63del//Perkþ/À
nerves, suggesting that Perk haploinsufficiency does not
have a strong influence on Chop upregulation.
CHOP must translocate into the nucleus in order to
act as a transcription factor (Ron and Habener, 1992). To
test whether Perk ablation could somehow impede Chop
nuclear translocation, we performed CHOP immunos-
taining on sciatic nerve sections from WT, Perkþ/À,
S63del, and S63del//Perkþ/À mice (Figure 6c). In
S63del//Perkþ/À nerves, CHOP localizes in Schwann
cell nuclei similarly to S63del (Figure 6c, insets).
Finally, to verify whether Chop is still able to up-regulate
its target genes, we tested the expression of Gadd34,
Figure 7. The ATF6 and IRE1 branches of the unfolded protein response are not affected by Perk ablation. (a) ATF6 cleavage analyzed by

a target gene of Chop. Gadd34 mRNA levels are elevated
in S63del nerves (D'Antonio et al., 2013), and its levels
remain elevated comparably in both S63del and S63del//
Perkþ/À nerves (Figure 6d). In addition, Doc1, 4, and 6,
other CHOP target genes, were not decreased (data not
shown). These data suggest that CHOP remains equally
functional in S63del and S63del//Perkþ/À nerves. Gadd34
protein levels were instead significantly decreased in
S63del//Perkþ/À mice as compared with S63del, consist-
ent with the fact that Gadd34 levels are also known to be
regulated post-transcriptionally (Figure 6e).
These results suggest that, although S63del//Perkþ/À
mice seem to phenocopy S63del//ChopÀ/À mice, the
amelioration of neuropathy observed here is likely to be
independent from Chop. Therefore, we considered other
candidates for S63del//Perkþ/À rescue, for example, in
the other UPR pathways.
Activation of Other UPR Sensors is Not Perturbed
in Response to Perkþ/À Haploinsufficiency
When challenged with ER stressors, Perk-null cells acti-
vate IRE1 more quickly and deactivate it more slowly
compared with control cells, suggesting a compensatory
overactivation of parallel UPR transducers in the absence
of Perk (Harding et al., 2000b). Moreover, in cells with
defective PERK signaling, increased activity of ATF6
and IRE1 stress pathways have been reported
(Yamaguchi et al., 2008). We therefore hypothesized
that Perk loss of function can ameliorate S63del myelin-
ation by augmenting folding capacity or ERAD, down-
stream of the other two UPR transducers. To test
whether ATF6 or IRE1 pathways are regulated in
response to Perk loss of function, we measured the
levels of cleaved ATF6 and Xbp1 splicing. ATF6 does
not respond to Perk heterozygosity, as cleaved ATF6
protein levels remain comparable in S63del and S63del//
Perkþ/À nerves (Figure 7a and b). Similarly, Xbp-1 spli-
cing did not show overt alterations between S63del//
Perkþ/À nerves (Figure 7c). These data suggest that
ATF6 and IRE1 branches of the UPR do not compensate
for Perk haploinsufficiency and to improve the
neuropathy.
Discussion
Transgenic mice expressing P0S63del manifest a demye-
linating neuropathy that mirrors CMT1B disease in
humans (Wrabetz et al., 2006). In S63del peripheral
nerves, P0 accumulates in the ER of Schwann cells, elicit-
ing an UPR (Wrabetz et al., 2006). Genetic or pharma-
cological impairment of Gadd34 in S63del nerves, which
should increase eIF2alpha phosphorylation, and reduce
the synthesis of P0S63del, fully rescued this neuropathy
phenotype (D'Antonio et al., 2013; Das et al., 2015).
To further explore this relationship, we performed the
converse experiment. Here, we report that crossing
S63del mice with Perk-deficient mice reduces eIF2alpha
phosphorylation in nerve by 40%, but surprisingly,
ameliorates rather than worsens S63del motor function
and its morphological hallmarks such as onion bulbs
and demyelinated fibers. Moreover, also myelin interno-
dal length increases significantly. These data suggest
that the regulation of eIF2alpha phosphorylation might
not be the only mechanism involved in the CMT1B
neuropathy.
PERK is the Main Kinase Phosphorylating
eIF2alpha in Nerve
eIF2alpha phosphorylation can be enhanced by several
stimuli, being the common target of the integrated stress
response (Harding et al., 2003; Dever et al., 2007).
At least four kinases phosphorylate eIF2alpha. PKR
responds to viral dsDNA (F. Zhang et al., 2001);
GCN2 and HRI respond to amino acid or heme depriv-
ation (Harding et al., 1999; Harding et al., 2000a;
P. Zhang et al., 2002b), whereas PERK reacts to ER
accumulation of unfolded proteins (Harding et al.,
2000b; P. Zhang et al., 2002a). Immunoprecipitation
experiments show that PERK is the eIF2alpha kinase
most abundant in S63del peripheral nerves and that its
activation parallels the dosage of the S63del transgene
(Figure 1c). Accordingly, eIF2alpha phosphorylation
decreases in S63del//Perkþ/À nerves and S63del//
Perkþ/À myelinating DRGs (Figure 4a). These results
indicate that PERK is the main kinase involved in
eIF2alpha phosphorylation in S63del neuropathy.
Interestingly, PERK is strongly active in P0OE nerves
where P0WT is overexpressed (Figure 1c). We had previ-
ously reported that P0WT overexpression weakly, but
significantly, increases BiP levels, without altering Chop
or Xbp1s levels (Pennuto et al., 2008). This may be
another example where UPR mediators play roles in
homeostasis during development. For example, Xbp1s
is required for normal differentiation of plasma cells,
which like Schwann cells, also express immunoglobulin
family members (Reimold et al., 2001; Iwakoshi et al.,
2003; Rutkowski and Hegde, 2010).
Repeated attempts to measure protein translation
rates in S63del and S63del//Perkþ/À nerves were per-
formed as previously described (D'Antonio et al., 2013),
but the method was not sensitive enough to reveal a dif-
ference between these two genotypes (not shown).
Nonetheless, the 40% decrease of P-eIF2alpha levels
was sufficient to promote alterations in myelination in
S63del nerves. Similarly, partial ablation of Perk was suf-
ficient to produce associated phenotypic changes in
mouse models of central demyelination (W. Lin et al.,
2005, 2006).
Musner et al. 13
PERK is Detrimental for S63del Myelination
PERK through phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, reduces
protein translation rates for almost 90% of cellular
mRNAs (Harding et al., 2001a; Ventoso et al., 2012).
When we attenuated translation by interfering with
Gadd34, and increasing eIF2alpha phosphorylation, we
were able to relieve the levels of UPR activation and
achieve almost complete morphological and functional
rescue of S63del neuropathy (D'Antonio et al., 2013).
Therefore, we performed the converse experiment in
Perkþ/À or S63del//Perkþ/À mice. Perk ablation in
mice without the P0S63del transgene reduced eIF2alpha
phosphorylation, and had a detrimental effect on motor
performance. Moreover, myelination in Perkþ/À and
PerkÀ/À DRG explants was impaired and the length of
internodes was shorter than WT (Figure 4b­d). These data
suggest that Perk is beneficial for myelination in WT.
In contrast, and to our great surprise, Perk deficiency in
S63del mice did not worsen, but ameliorated morphological
and functional features of neuropathy (Figures 2, 3, and 5).
Onion bulbs and demyelinated fibers, the hallmarks of
S63del neuropathy, were rescued in S63del//Perkþ/À ani-
mals (Figure 3). Functionally, motor performance was sig-
nificantly ameliorated in S63del//Perkþ/À animals,
strongly suggesting that Perk contributes a detrimental
effect to the pathogenesis of S63del neuropathy (Figure 2).
In Perkþ/À mice, Perk ablation may negatively influ-
ence motor phenotype not only by acting in peripheral
nerves, but also in other tissues. In this mouse model, one
Perk allele is ablated in all cells of the body, and Perk
haploinsufficiency is known to have negative conse-
quences in several organs (Harding et al., 2001b)--some
crucial for motor function (i.e., brain, spinal cord, or
muscle; Jones and Roberts, 1968; Hamm et al., 1994;
Rustay et al., 2003; Minasyan et al., 2009; Shiotsuki
et al., 2010). For example, in the brain, it is possible
that Perk haploinsufficiency can interfere with the
motor learning phase of rotarod analysis or myelination
(W. Lin and Popko, 2009; Trinh et al., 2012), whereas, in
muscle, Perk ablation can impair myocyte Ca2þ signaling
and contraction (Huang et al., 2006). Another possibility
is that Perk ablation could contribute to S63del neur-
opathy in a non-nerve autonomous way, but without
obvious morphological changes outside of nerve. For
example, a systemic metabolic disturbance like glucose
intolerance (Harding et al., 2001b) could secondarily
affect neurons or Schwann cells negatively. Thus, nerve-
independent effects could contribute to the poor rotarod
performance of Perkþ/À mice, even if morphology and
NCV studies of sciatic nerve appear grossly normal
(Figure 2).
However, these same detrimental effects are not likely
to explain the altered rotarod performance in S63del//
Perkþ/À mice, as it improved relative to S63del.
Accordingly, we did not document any correlating
morphological alteration in cerebellum, spinal cord, or
muscle, apart from a very slight increase (from 0.5% to
1.5%) of centrally nucleated fibers in S63del gastrocne-
mius muscle, that returned toward normal in S63del//
Perkþ/À. Centrally nucleated fibers are linked with
muscle degeneration/regeneration. However, 1­2% cen-
trally nucleated fibers have been reported in normal
young adult mouse muscle (Sonnemann et al., 2006). In
contrast, clinically symptomatic mice with early muscular
dystrophy typically have already 30­60% centrally
nucleated fibers (Nguyen et al., 2002).
Perk-Null Neurons Do Not Alter Myelination
by S63del Schwann Cells
To eliminate a possible role for other tissues in the
improvement of S63del//Perkþ/À mice, we studied the
effect of Perk ablation on myelination in cultures contain-
ing only Schwann cells and neurons. We isolated DRGs
from S63del//PerkÀ/À embryos and induced myelination
in vitro (Taveggia et al., 2005). This experiment also
allowed us to study complete ablation of Perk. In
S63del//Perkþ/À and S63del//PerkÀ/À myelinating
explant cultures, the increased internodal length nicely
correlated with the rescue observed in S63del//Perkþ/À
sciatic nerves, suggesting, once more, that Perk has a det-
rimental function for S63del myelination (Figure 4).
Myelination depends on carefully orchestrated, reciprocal
signals between neurons and Schwann cells (Taveggia
et al., 2010). We then asked whether altering Perk and
eIF2-alpha phosphorylation in neurons could influence
myelination, in a non-cell autonomous manner. To test
this hypothesis, we cultured Perk-deficient neurons with
WT rat Schwann cells, already known to myelinate
mouse neurons normally (Taveggia et al., 2005). The
high rate of myelination observed in all genotypes ana-
lyzed indicates that Perk-deleted neurons do not alter
myelination. These data, together with the results of
DRG explant myelination, suggest that Perk influences
myelination in a Schwann cell autonomous manner.
Future experiments may address this in vivo, by deleting
Perk in Schwann cells and neurons using conditional
ablation of Perk with Cre-recombinases (P. Zhang
et al., 2002a).
S63del//Perkþ/À Rescue is not correlated
with Alterations in Chop and Gadd34
It has been shown that Chop and Gadd34 are detrimental
in S63del neuropathy. In fact, the complete ablation of
Chop or Gadd34 rescued S63del neuropathy in vivo
(Pennuto et al., 2008; D'Antonio et al., 2013). Although
they are downstream of PERK, surprisingly, Chop and
Gadd34 mRNA expression were not reduced in S63del//
Perkþ/À compared with S63del sciatic nerves. This is
14 ASN Neuro
consistent with previous reports showing that Chop can
be upregulated independently by ATF6 (Yoshida et al.,
2000). Additionally, CHOP remains detected in nuclei of
myelinating Schwann cells, and CHOP target genes
remain activated, suggesting that CHOP loss of function
does not explain rescue in S63del//Perkþ/À mice.
Gadd34 protein levels, instead, drop by about half in
absence of PERK (Figure 6e). This can be explained by
the post-transcriptional regulation of Gadd34 mRNA
mediated by the uORF regions in the 50 UTR of its
mRNA, similar to ATF4 (Harding et al., 2000a).
Gadd34/PP1 holoenzyme promotes eIF2alpha depho-
sphorylation and restarts protein translation after initial
pausing (Brush et al., 2003; Marciniak et al., 2004).
Complete genetic ablation of Gadd34 rescues S63del
neuropathy phenotype by impeding reversal of protein
synthesis (D'Antonio et al., 2013); haploinsufficiency of
Gadd34 had no effect on S63del neuropathy. Even if
S63del//Perkþ/À mice resemble S63del//Perkþ/À-defi-
cient mice functionally and morphologically, the amelior-
ation observed in this study is not correlated with
eIF2alpha phosphorylation levels. In S63del//Perkþ/À
mice, eIF2alpha is hypo-phosphorylated (Figure 1d;
40% lower than S63del mice), whereas in S63del/
Gadd34-deficient mice, eIF2alpha is overphosphorylated
(30% higher; D'Antonio et al., 2013). This indicates that
translational homeostasis is not the main mechanism of
rescue in S63del//Perkþ/À mice.
The role of the Perk pathway in neurodegenerative
and other ER stress-related diseases is still controversial.
For instance, PERK is beneficial in models of central
nervous system (CNS) and PNS demyelination (W. Lin
et al., 2006; D'Antonio et al., 2009; D'Antonio et al.,
2013; W. Lin et al., 2013; Y. Lin et al., 2014). In contrast,
Perk elimination is protective in prion disease and in the
diabetic Akita mice (Gupta et al., 2010; Moreno et al.,
2012; Moreno et al., 2013).
A possible explanation is that Perk ablation elicits
alternative and beneficial responses to cope with stress
in a context-dependent manner. For example, Perk-null
cells challenged with tunicamycin, an ER stress inducer,
manifest prolonged IRE1 activation (Harding et al.,
2000b; A. H. Lee et al., 2002; K. Lee et al., 2003;
Walter and Ron, 2011). Therefore, we reasoned that the
lack of PERK in S63del could induce other UPR path-
ways to compensate. However, our data show that Perk
haploinsufficiency did not alter either the IRE1 or ATF6
pathways in S63del nerves.
Collectively, our data show that Perk ablation para-
doxically improves S63del neuropathy despite that
eIF2alpha phosphorylation is reduced in nerve. We thus
conclude that the translational homeostasis in Schwann
cells is not the only factor involved in the pathogenesis of
CMT1B. For example, we cannot rule out a possible
effect of beneficial effect of Perk deletion in neurons or
other cells, which may contribute to the phenotype
observed in S63del//Perkþ/À mice. In order to study
the cell autonomous effect of Perk, we will need to
delete Perk specifically in neurons or Schwann cells in
the S63del mice in a future study.
Summary Statement
PERK kinase senses stress in the ER and attenuates
translation through eIF2alpha phosphorylation, a bene-
ficial response in many ER stress-related diseases.
Nonetheless, the authors report that Perk ablation sur-
prisingly improves CMT1B peripheral neuropathy.
