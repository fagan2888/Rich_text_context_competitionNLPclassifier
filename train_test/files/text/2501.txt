Grandmaternal education may be related to grandchild birth weight (GBW) through maternal early-life develop-
ment; however, conventional regression models may be endogenously confounded. Alternative models employing
explicit structural assumptions may provide incrementally clearer evidence. We used data from the US National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (1995­2009; 1,681 mother-child pairs) to estimate "direct effects"
of grandmaternal educational level (less than high school, high school diploma or equivalent, or college degree) at
the time of the mother's birth on GBW, adjusted for maternal life-course factors: maltreatment as a child, education
and income as an adult, prepregnancy overweight, and prenatal smoking. Using conventional and marginal structural
model (MSM) approaches, we estimated 54-g (95% confidence interval: -14.0, 122.1) and 87-g (95% confidence in-
terval: 10.9, 162.5) higher GBWs per increase in educational level, respectively. The MSM allowed simultaneous
mediation by and adjustment for prepregnancy overweight. Estimates were insensitive to alternate structural assump-
tions and mediator parameterizations. Bias analysis suggested that a single unmeasured confounder would have to
have a strong influence on GBW (approximately 150 g) or be greatly imbalanced across exposure groups (approxi-
mately 25%) to completely explain the findings. Coupling an MSM with sensitivity analyses provides some evidence
that maternal early-life socioeconomic environment is directly associated with offspring birth weight.

Many mechanisms potentially link education to health across
the life span (1) and intergenerationally (2). For example,
grandmaternal education may be directly related to grandchild
health through the early development of mothers, independent
of maternal attained socioeconomic status (SES) (3). Specifi-
cally, lower maternal educational attainment may be associated
with an adverse intrauterine environment, fetal organogenesis,
and epigenetic programming (4­6). For females, such pro-
gramming may lead to poorer adult metabolic capacity, ad-
verse pregnancy outcomes, and lower birth weight for the third
generation (6­9).
Studies investigating associations between grandparental
education and grandchild birth weight are few, and the estimated
direct effects are difficult to interpret (9, 10). One challenge is
the interpretation of results from multivariable regression mod-
els which adjust for maternal life-course variables that may be
endogenous confounders (11­13). For example, attained body
mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)2) may be a metabolic
consequence of intrauterine development and may mediate its

impact on adult outcomes (14). At the same time, BMI may
confound adult risk factor­outcome relationships. Unlike
conventional regression, marginal structural models (MSMs)
may be used to explicitly model such relationships and pro-

on the intergenerational transmission of education employed
an MSM to control for child and grandchild schooling (19).
Incorporation of sensitivity analyses for modeling assump-
tions and unmeasured confounding can further strengthen
evidence (20­22).
Focusing on maternal early-life environment (6, 8), we es-
timated associations between grandmaternal education at the
time of the mother's birth and grandchild birth weight using
several multivariable regression models adjusting for mater-
nal life-course factors. We compared these estimates with
those obtained from structural equation models (SEMs) and
MSM approaches. We used sensitivity analyses to evaluate
whether MSM estimates differed due to model parameteriza-
tion, assumptions about causal structure, and/or unmeasured
confounding.
METHODS
Study setting
We used data from the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a nationally repre-
sentative US longitudinal study of grade 7­12 adolescents
(approximate ages 12­18 years) that began in 1994 (n =
90,118). Detailed information on Add Health respondents,
the sampling frame, weighting algorithms (23), and study
protocols can be found on the study's website (www.cpc.
unc.edu/projects/addhealth/). Briefly, in-home interviews
were conducted with a core subset of respondents (randomly
selected within school and sex strata) along with a parent,
during which information was collected on demographic fac-
tors,health, attitudes, behaviors, and environment. Additional
respondents and parents were interviewed on the basis of eth-
nic minority status, having siblings in the study, and/or being
black with at least 1 college-educated parent (n = 20,745 re-
spondents). Respondents first interviewed in wave I were fol-
lowed for up to 3 additional in-home interviews conducted in
1996 (wave II), 2001­2002 (wave III), and 2007­2008 (wave
IV). During wave IV, a total of 15,701 respondents (80.3% of
those eligible in wave I) were interviewed. To approximate the
target population of US adolescents in grades 7­11 in 1994­
1995, investigators derived a grand sampling weight account-
ing for clustered sampling, attrition, and oversampling (23).
Research on these data has been approved by the Institution-
al Review Board of the University of Washington (Seattle,
Washington).
Study population
Respondents (G1--"mother") were eligible for the current
study if they were women, had a biological mother (G0--
"grandmother") who was interviewed during wave I, partici-
pated in both the wave I and wave IV interviews, and had at
least 1 livebirth (G2--"grandchild") during the course of the
study. Since firstborn offspring are hypothesized to be more
susceptible to adverse in utero programming from maternal
constraint (24),wematchedG1stotheirfirstreportedsingleton
birth (G2). There were 2,352 women who met the eligibility
criteria. After excluding 48 (2.0%) respondents missing a re-
corded exposure status and 416 (18.0%) respondents missing
a wave IV grand sampling weight because of missing wave II/
III interviews, and 12 (0.5%) respondents missing both, we
included 1,876 G1-G2 pairs in the current study. Women
with missing sampling weights did not differ substantially
from the analytical population (see Web Table 1, available at
http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/).
Measures
Primary exposure and outcome. During wave I (1994­
1995), a respondent's mother (G0) was asked, "How far did
you go in school?" Responses were coded into 3 categories:
less than high school diploma, high school diploma or equiv-
alent (e.g., General Educational Development certificate),
or completed college degree. Because we were interested in
G1s' intrauterine experiences, we capped completed education
at a high school diploma if G0 gave birth at or prior to age 21
years (n = 86). G2 birth weight (grams) was reported by G1
during the wave IV interview. When compared with birth rec-
ords, maternal recall of child birth weight is fairly accurate (9).
G1 psychosocial and socioeconomic stress mediators.
Childhood maltreatment (25) and adult SES (26) are impor-
tant psychosocial stressors in G1s' life course that may lie
within the causal pathway between G0 education and G2 birth
weight. In line with previous investigations in Add Health
(25), we used self-reported incidents of neglect, physical
abuse, and sexual abuse prior to 18 years of age to construct
a maltreatment factor score. Factor scores were generated
using principle-component factor analysis and quartimin
rotations. Adult SES closest to the time of G2's birth was
measured using 3 variables: 1) self-reported total household
income (dollars) during wave IV or one of the following ap-
proximations, based on the midpoint of categorical choices
(capped at $100,000): $5,000, $12,500, $17,500, $25,000,
$35,000, $45,000, $62,500, or $100,000; 2) attained educa-
tion, categorized by last grade or schooling type completed;
and 3) an indicator of whether G1 reported that she would be
in debt in response to the following question: "Suppose you
and others in your household were to sell all of your major
possessions (including your home), turn all of your invest-
ments and other assets into cash, and pay off all of your
debts. Would you have something left over, break even, or
be in debt?" A factor score for adult SES was predicted as
described above. If the respondent gave birth to G2 prior to
2001, a wave III factor score was calculated excluding the
debt measure, not asked about in wave III. Correlations be-
tween the 2 SES factor scores were moderate (unadjusted
Pearson's r = 0.578; n = 1,665). Maltreatment and adult SES
factor scores were also dichotomized at their median values
(high/low; 19% had discordant wave III and wave IV SES
categories).
G1 biological and behavioral mediators. Higher prepreg-
nancy BMI is associated with lower maternal education and
higher birth weights and may be a consequence of early-life
programming (27, 28). G1 prepregnancy BMI was calculated
Grandmaternal Education, Birth Weight, and Bias Analyses 569
Am J Epidemiol. 2015;182(7):568­578
from weight and height measures obtained by either wave II
self-report, if G1 gave birth prior to or during 2001 (35%
of births), or wave III study staff. Correlation between the 2
BMI measures was high (unadjusted Pearson's r = 0.76; P <
0.0001), and past findings suggest that such self-reports may
be reasonably accurate (29). Prepregnancy overweight status
was defined as a BMI of 25 or more. Prenatal smoking is as-
sociated with maternal education and lower birth weight (27,
28, 30). We coded G1 prenatal smoking as any or none, based
on self-reported smoking during the index pregnancy.
Time-invariant confounders. G0 age at G1's birth is re-
lated to G0 educational attainment and may influence child-
rearing practices and therefore the life-course psychosocial
and biological stressors experienced by G1 (31, 32). Simi-
larly, G0 self-reported race is related to G0 educational op-
portunity and attainment, as well as stressors experienced
by G1 (33, 34). G0 race was coded as non-Hispanic white,
Hispanic white, black (any ethnicity), or other nonwhite,
with persons who reported any mixed race not including
black being accorded the last category. Both variables were
included as confounders in all analyses.
Statistical analysis
We examined the possibility that early-life SES may be as-
sociated with future pregnancy outcome (Figure 1) using 3
modeling approaches to estimate the direct effect of grandma-
ternal (G0) educational category (Xi
) on the birth weight (Yi
)
of her daughter's (G1) child (G2), including any "develop-
mental programming" pathway mediated through G1 prepreg-
nancy overweight (Oi
): 1) covariate-adjusted linear regression
models of measured predictors of G2 birth weight, 2) a linear
SEM using dichotomous mediators, and 3) a linear MSM
using dichotomous mediators estimated by inverse probability
weights. Using each approach, we attempted to account for
time-invariant confounding by G0 age at G1's birth (Gi
) and
G0 self-reported race (Ri
), as well as endogenous confounding
by G1 life-course mediators: a high level of childhood mal-
treatment prior to age 18 years (Mi
), prepregnancy overweight
(Oi
), low adult SES (Ai
), and any prenatal smoking (Si
). Fi-
nally, we tested vulnerability to certain model assumptions
through sensitivity analyses.
Covariate-adjusted linear regression. Under this ap-
proach, it is impossible to estimate an effect of Xi
on Yi
while
simultaneously controlling for mediator-outcome confound-
ing by G1 prepregnancy overweight or obesity status (Oi
). In-
stead, we fitted 2 separate multivariable linear regression
models including exposure, confounders, and life-course me-
diators as predictors of G2 birth weight, including (model 1)
and excluding (model 2) adjustment for Oi

Neither model 1 (equation 1) nor model 2 (equation 2) can

Note that variables for controlling confounding by G0 race and
age (collectively, the vector C) do not appear directly in model
3 but rather are controlled indirectly by including C in the
weighting equations (equations 4­7). O is excluded in model
3, allowing the mediated path to be included in the controlled
direct effect.
To account for the survey design and produce correct stan-
dard errors (23), we estimated each weight with the svy op-
tion in Stata (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas) after
using the wave IV grand sampling weights ðwgsw
i
Þ; clustering,
and stratification variables for the svyset command in
Stata. An overall weight (Woverall
) was then generated for
each subject using the product of the stabilized weights and

The svy option was subsequently used to fit model 3 using
Woverall
for the svyset command. An analogous method was
described by Brumback et al. (36) for SAS (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, North Carolina). No interaction terms were in-
cluded in these analyses, as there was not consistent evidence
of additive mediator-exposure interactions.
Past literature has outlined important assumptions required
to identify controlled direct effects using inverse probability
weight estimators (12, 13). We evaluated the potential viola-
tions of the positivity assumption through the production

of contingency tables, crossing each exposure and mediator
by category of predictor, graphing distributions of weights,
and searching for small predicted probabilities (37). We found
little evidence for violations of positivity (Web Tables 2­4;
Web Figure 1). In addition, to address the validity of our
model on the basis of prior knowledge and temporal sequence
and assumptions regarding no unmeasured exposure- and
mediator-outcome confounding, we conducted several sen-
sitivity analyses.
Sensitivity analyses
Model specification. Preterm birth is an important medi-
ator of low birth weight and may be of great interest (38, 39).
We refitted model 3 after adding an indicator for birth before
37 weeks' gestation and a corresponding probability weight.
Additionally, we examined the sensitivity of model 3 to:
1) truncating weights at the 1st/99th, 5th/95th, and 10th/90th
percentiles to evaluate the influence of rare treatment types
(37); 2) including interaction terms in the estimation of
weights (equations 4­7); and 3) reversing the presumed tem-
poral relationship of adult SES and prepregnancy overweight
by removing O from equation 6.
Data replacement. To analyze the sensitivity of our anal-
ysis to mediator values missing at random conditional on
available data, we refitted models 1 and 2 using multiple im-
putation by chained equations (40). For model 3, sensitivity to
missingness was assessed by replacing missing values for G1
mediators and reweighting. Three strategies were used for re-
placement: First, all missing values were assumed to be indic-
ative of risk (i.e., missing values for adult SES were replaced
with an indicator of low adult SES); second, missing values
for wave III prepregnancy overweight and wave IV adult SES
were replaced with their values from waves II and III, respec-
tively; and third, all values for these 2 mediators were replaced
with their values from waves II and III, respectively.

Quantitative bias analysis. To assess the robustness of
model 3 to unmeasured confounding, we simulated the influ-
ence of a hypothetical binary mediator-outcome confounder
(22, 41). Assuming an unmeasured binary confounder U with
no effect modification by G0 education, we specified ranges
for 2 sensitivity parameters g and d, with g corresponding to
the effect of U on G2 birth weight (i.e., change in grams) and
d to the prevalence difference of confounder U between levels
of exposure. By subtracting each combination of g × d from
the 1
coefficient and 95% confidence interval estimated by
model 3, we located bounds within which our findings re-
mainedvalidunder thespecifiedscenario. Wesettherangesof
values for g and d to be feasible values drawn from our SEM
and consistent with the literature. For example, since prena-
tal smoking is a strong determinant of birth weight observed
in the literature (28, 30), the upper limits for g were set at a
level close to the effect of prenatal smoking observed in our
SEM. Similarly, we set the upper limit of d to be ±25%,
which was close to the difference in prenatal smoking prev-
alence between high and low G1 adult SES estimated in our
SEM.
All data processing and analysis were conducted in Stata
12.1 MP.
RESULTS
Overall, 21%, 63%, and 16% of G0s in the analytical popu-
lation reported educational levels of less than high school, high
school diploma or equivalent, and college degree at the time
of G1's birth, respectively. Mean G2 birth weight was 3,220 g,
3,268 g, and 3,309 g among G0s with less than high school, a
high school diploma or equivalent, and a college degree, re-
spectively (Table 1).
Adjusting for prepregnancy overweight and other covari-
ates through multivariable regression (model 1), we estimated
45-g (95% confidence interval (CI): -28.0, 118.8) and 54-g
(95% CI: -14.0, 122.1; Table 2) higher G2 birth weights for
each increase in G0 educational level in models controlling
for continuous and dichotomized mediators, respectively.

produced slightly smaller estimates of association, between
33 g and 45 g per G0 educational category, suggestive of re-
sidual confounding. Estimates from the dichotomous media-
tor model after multiple imputation produced estimates of
47.7 g and 57.3 g for adjusted and unadjusted models, re-
spectively (Table 2). Our SEM provided supportive evidence
for the confounding influence of G0 race and age at G1 birth,
with 2 exceptions: We found no association between G0 non-
white status and G1 childhood maltreatment, and we found
an unexpected positive association between G1 high mal-
treatment and high adult SES (Figure 2).
Using an MSM estimated by inverse probability weight-
ing, we found an 87-g higher (95% CI: 10.9, 162.5) G2
birth weight for each increase in G0 educational level, con-
trolled for life-course mediators (Table 3). Associations
between G2 birth weight and other mediators were in ex-
pected directions, with proximal determinants such as G1
prenatal smoking having the strongest magnitude of associa-
tion. We found weaker evidence for a controlled direct effect
of G0 education on G2 birth weight upon incorporating a pre-
term birth mediator ( = 65.1, 95% CI: -1.4, 131.5; Table 4).
Other sensitivity analyses did not alter interpretations greatly
(Table 4). Notably, truncating weights to limit the influence
of outlying exposure types only strengthened associations,
albeit at the cost of exposure model misspecification (37).
Moreover, data replacement techniques did not greatly alter the
magnitude or precision of estimates, though confidence inter-
vals were generally wide. Under the hypothetical bias sce-
narios, we found that a single binary confounder would have
to differ in prevalence between exposure groups by at least 25%
(and affect G2 birth weight by approximately 50 g) or have an
effect on G2 birth weight of 150 g (and differ by approximately
10%) to fully explain our findings (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
Overall, we found fairly robust evidence for an association
between grandmaternal (G0) education at the time of a moth-
er's (G1) birth on the birth weight of her grandchild (G2), in-
dependent of the mother's mediating life course. We found
an 87-g (95% CI: 10.9, 162.5) higher G2 birth weight asso-
ciated with each increase in G0 educational level (less than
high school, high school diploma or equivalent, or college
degree), after adjusting for childhood maltreatment, low adult
SES, prenatal smoking, and endogenous confounding by pre-
pregnancy BMI. Our findings were robust to tested model
alterations, data replacement, and several unmeasured con-
founding scenarios.
Early-life determinants of pregnancy outcomes are of partic-
ular interest (2), particularly because of the insensitivity of low
birthweighttoknowninterventions (42).There issomebiolog-
ical plausibility for an association between lower grandmater-
nal educational status and grandchild birth weight through
glucocorticoid exposure and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis programming pathways (5­9). However, prior empirical
studies on associations between grandparental education and
grandchild birth have not provided consistent evidence (9, 10):
In a studyof predominantly African Americans and low-income
whites, Astone et al. (9) found high grandmaternal education
to be associated with a 181-g increased grandchild birth weight
among mothers with a high school education or less. However,
Kwok et al. (10) found no such association after adjusting for
parental education. The potential influence of endogenous
confounding was not tested in either study. Controlling for
endogenous confounding by maternal prepregnancy BMI, a
strong determinant of birth weight, we found relatively strong
evidence for an association.

a For this analysis, point estimates () and 95% CIs were adjusted for a hypothetical, unmeasured binary confounder by subtracting a product of 2 bias parameters: d, indicating the imbalance
of the confounder between strata of the exposure or mediator, and g, indicating the effect of the confounder on the outcome.
b These adjusted estimates have 95% CIs that encompass zero; therefore, a confounder with the corresponding bias parameters would be sufficient to explain the original controlled direct
effect estimate. That is, the first column demonstrates that an unmeasured binary confounder associated with a 150-g lower G2 birth weight would have to be 5%­10% less prevalent among
highly educated grandmothers to account for the original estimate. For comparison, any G1 prenatal smoking was 6.4% lower among college-educated grandmothers than among grandmothers
with less than a high school education and was associated with a 118-g reduction in G2 birth weight.

Our approach contributed several strengths to this investi-
gation. First, prominent determinants of birth weight, includ-
ing prepregnancy BMI, prenatal smoking, and self-reported
race (28) and mediation by childhood maltreatment (25),
were explicitly included in our models. Second, we addressed
the possibility of incorrect model specification and mismea-
surement through a variety of techniques and found that these
scenarios had little influence on estimates. For example, it is
plausible that adult SES influences prepregnancy BMI. Nei-
ther swapping the causal ordering (through reweighting) nor
using alternative (i.e., earlier wave) measures of these medi-
ators appeared to greatly affect estimates. Additionally, the
consistent estimates across models that adjusted for different
covariate parameterizations (Table 2) suggest that residual
confounding from dichotomization was not likely to be re-
sponsible for our MSM findings. Dichotomization at other
cutpoints for low adult SES or childhood maltreatment did
not change our substantive interpretations. In fact, using the
20th percentile as the cutpoint for low adult SES strengthened
estimated associations (results not shown). Our quantitative
bias analysis suggested that a single binary confounder would
need to be fairly strong and imbalanced across exposure
groups to fully explain our estimates. Third, confidence in our
findings is also improved by the concurrence of secondary
model findings with past literature: Notably, we observed
greater strengths of association between G2 birth weight and
proximate G1 mediators, prenatal smoking and adult SES,
than between G2 birth weight and childhood maltreatment
using the MSM. In addition, the magnitude of birth weight
reduction due to prenatal smoking was in line with findings
from past meta-analyses (28, 43). Finally, our choice to esti-
mate a controlled direct effect allowed us to address the ques-
tion, What association with grandmaternal education remains
even after strictly controlling more proximal, life-course de-
terminants of birth weight outcome? Finding an association
in this context helps provide justification for continued inves-
tigation of early-life factors despite the prevailing clinical
focus on modifiable perinatal maternal factors. Furthermore,
unlike the case with natural direct effect estimation, we were
able to avoid cross-world assumptions (44).
Some limitations of our study are worth highlighting. In
spite of several sensitivity and bias analyses, model misspe-
cification and unmeasured cofounding were still possible. In
recent publications, several authors have questioned the abil-
ityofconventionalobservationmethodstocompletelyaccount
for these issues (45, 46). We attempted to address these lim-
itations through model alterations (Web Tables 5­13) and by
quantifying the influence of potential unmeasured confound-
ers. However, it is still possible that several nonbinary un-
measured confounders may collectively explain our findings
(22, 41). Since Add Health was not designed to investigate
characteristics surrounding the respondent's (G1) birth, we
were limited in our ability to incorporate potentially interesting
G1 perinatal exposures. These include infection, air pollution,
G0 nutrition, and smoking. When breastfeeding duration and
G0 smoking during G1 adolescence (Web Table 5) were incor-
porated into our MSM analyses, point estimates and confidence
intervalswerevirtuallyunchanged.Sinceourstudyreliedalmost
solely on self-reports (with the exception of wave III BMI), bias
due to measurement error is also a concern. Specifically, recall
of childhood maltreatment and prenatal smoking may be differ-
entially misclassified by grandmaternal and maternal SES. No-
tably, this may explain the unexpected positive association
between childhood maltreatment and adult SES in our SEM.
Finally, we stress that findings from our study should be
interpreted as suggestive associations rather than estimates of
causal effects per se. Education represents a state which may
be achieved through a variety of pathways and consequently
(47) may be indicative of 1 or more true causal exposures with
varying influences on early-life environment and future preg-
nancyoutcome.Nonetheless,theidentificationofaconsistent,
direct association between an early-life factor and pregnancy
outcome under various causal assumptions coupled with a
variety of sensitivity approaches supports the pursuit of more
specific early-life causal exposures that may explain the role
of education as a fundamental, transgenerational determinant
of health (48). Further research on biological mechanisms--
for example, fetal glucocorticoid exposure due to maternal
education-related stressors (5­7)--may help to identify more
precise causal effects.
