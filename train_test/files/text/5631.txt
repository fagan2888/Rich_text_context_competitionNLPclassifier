Abstract
Using data from the 2013 American Community Survey, we found that 24.3 million people (about 1 in 4) who were either
eligible for Medicaid/Children's Health Inusrance Program (CHIP) or appeared likely to shop for Qualified Health Plan (QHP)
lacked residential high-speed Internet. Specifically, 28.6% or 18.9 million people eligible for Medicaid/CHIP and 17.1% or 5.5
million people who appeared likely to shop for a QHP did not have high-speed Internet in the home. For both the Medicaid/
CHIP eligible and those likely to shop for a QHP, the proportion of people living in households without Internet varied
substantially by race, geography, and other socio-demographic characteristics.

Introduction
A key feature of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is the estab-
lishment of online Marketplaces that make it easier to apply
for and enroll in health insurance. The online Marketplaces
facilitate eligibility determination for Medicaid/Children's
Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and for tax credits that
subsidize private insurance. They also provide a central loca-
tion to compare and shop for Qualified Health Plans (QHPs).
During the 2015 open enrollment period, the Marketplaces
had 35.2 million Web visitors compared with 16.8 million
telephone contacts.1
The online Marketplaces appear to have been successful
at attracting visitors, but people without Internet in the home
face additional application burdens that could dissuade appli-
cation and enrollment. The "digital divide" has narrowed in
recent years, but there are still gaps in residential Internet
that could cause barriers to health plan enrollment under the
ACA.2,3 Only one previous study, to our knowledge, has
examined Internet availability among populations targeted
by the online Marketplaces.4 That study, a 2013 survey spon-
sored by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), found that
19% of uninsured adults below 139% of poverty and 14% of
uninsured adults between 139% and 400% of poverty could
not easily access the Internet from home or another location,
compared with 98% of those with income above 400% of the
Federal Poverty Level (FPL).
The KFF study suggested that a substantial share of adults
who could likely benefit from an online Marketplace lacked
easy access to the Internet. However, the study had limita-
tions. The survey excluded children even though children are
an important population served by the online Marketplaces.
Children could have different levels of Internet availability
given that they tend to live in poorer households compared
with childless adults.5 Compared with large federal surveys,
the KFF study had a moderately sized sample (n = 8762).
Furthermore, 50% of their sample was concentrated in
California, Missouri, and Texas. The authors were unable to
examine how Internet access varied across different demo-
graphic groups. Identifying groups that are at more or less

risk of lacking Internet is important for tailoring ACA out-
reach to specific consumer groups.
This article expands on the KFF study using new data
from recently added questions on the American Community
Survey (ACS). Using these data, we estimate the number
(and percentage) of people who lack residential high-speed
Internet, within populations that otherwise appear likely to
benefit from an online Marketplace. For those who do report
residential Internet, we estimate the share that relies exclu-
sively on a mobile connection. Not only do those who rely
solely on mobile connections tend to have less stable access
to the Internet due to data limits and service interruptions,6
but applying for and choosing a plan from a mobile devise
(when a Marketplace is mobile compatible) might pose
unique challenges as well. For example, whereas 35% of all
HealthCare.gov visits were from a mobile device, only 15%
of consumers who signed up for coverage during the second
enrollment period did so through a mobile device.7 This sug-
gests that consumers may find mobile enrollment difficult.
Finally, we leverage the large sample size of the ACS (n =
3 132 795 million individuals) to examine how Internet
availability varies across subgroups, before and after adjust-
ing for covariates. Our results inform ongoing outreach
activities and speak to how recent proposals to subsidize
Internet access could have important implications for health
policy initiatives.
Methods
Data come from the 2013 ACS--a household survey con-
ducted annually by the US Census Bureau. In 2013, the
Census Bureau added new questions that assessed the pres-
ence and type of residential Internet service (eg, dial-up,
cable, mobile).2 We used these new data to identify people
who did not have high-speed Internet in the home. We
focused on high-speed Internet because the constraints
imposed by dial-up service are often prohibitive.
We identified two distinct groups of non-elderly individu-
als (aged 0-64) deemed most likely to benefit from the online
Marketplaces: those enrolled or otherwise eligible for
Medicaid and those who appeared likely to shop for a QHP.
Both groups were defined using information on health insur-
ance coverage held on the day of interview and annual fam-
ily income. Family income was obtained by summing
personal income within health insurance units--a collection
of related individuals who could be covered under the same
private health insurance plan (ie, a nuclear family).
The first group was composed of non-elderly people who
were either currently enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP or appeared
eligible because they were uninsured and had family
incomes below 2014 state specific Medicaid/CHIP income
thresholds.8 The income thresholds varied by state and by
categorical eligibility type. The eligibility types included
children, pregnant women (identified in the ACS as women
that gave birth in the last year), parents, and childless adults.
The second group we considered included people who
appeared likely to shop for a QHP (called "potential
Marketplace participants" in the tables below). We defined
this group as people who had incomes above state-specific
Medicaid/CHIP income thresholds or 100% of poverty,
whichever was higher, and were either uninsured or insured
through the individual market. We excluded the population
below 100% of FPL(people not eligible for Medicaid because
they lived in a state that had not expanded Medicaid) because
QHPs are likely unaffordable for this group and they are not
eligible for financial assistance. Finally, we also considered a
higher socioeconomic status group--people who had
employer-sponsored insurance and family incomes above
400% of poverty. This group was used as a reference group.
In each of these groups, we estimated the number and per-
centage of people who lived in a household without high-
speed Internet, overall and for selected socio-demographic
groups. Our choice of groups was informed by previous
research examining the digital divide. 1,2 Specifically, racial
minorities, the less educated, those living in rural areas, and
other traditionally vulnerable groups tend to be less likely to
have Internet in the home compared with their counterparts.
One of the most important predictors we examine is family
income relative to the federal poverty guidelines (FPG).
Each group has different income distributions by definition
so we use different poverty levels depending on the group.
For the Medicaid/CHIP group, we use 0% to 49%, 50% to
99%, 100% to 138%, and 139%+ FPG. For the potential
Marketplace participants, we use 100% to 199%, 200% to
299%, 300% to 399%, and 400%+ FPG. For simplicity, we
label the categories low, moderate-low, moderate-high, and
high for each group.
We report both unadjusted and adjusted rates (ie, pre-
dicted probabilities scaled to the percent scale) that were
obtained from logistic regression. Standard errors and statis-
tical tests were adjusted for the complex sample design of the
ACS.9 We defined statistical significance using a critical
value of 0.05. Like all survey data, ACS estimates are subject
to non-sampling error. However, the new Internet estimates
track closely with other sources, including widely used data
from the Pew Internet Project.10
Results
Overall we found that among all those who could potentially
benefit from access to an online Marketplace ("potential
Marketplace users"), 24.3 million or 24.8% lacked residen-
tial Internet (Figure 1). More than 1 in 4 non-elderly people
(18.8 million) who were either currently enrolled or other-
wise appeared eligible for Medicaid/CHIP lacked high-speed
Internet in the home. An additional 5.5 million potential
Marketplace participants lacked residential Internet (17.1%).
Comparatively, having high-speed residential Internet was
nearly universal for high­socioeconomic status individuals
with employer-sponsored health insurance.
Boudreaux et al 3
We found that roughly 10% of Internet users who were
Medicaid eligible and 8% of Internet users who were likely
to participate in a Marketplace depended solely on a mobile
connection (data not shown). Comparatively, only 4.7% of
Internet users in the high­socioeconomic status group were
mobile users only.
By definition, the Medicaid/CHIP eligible and potential
Marketplace participants differ according to income. In
Table 1, we explore other population characteristics for each
sample. Nearly half of the individuals currently enrolled or
potentially eligible for Medicaid/CHIP are children, and over
half are also living in households where the householder is
working part-time or not working at all. Meanwhile, poten-
tial Marketplace participants were more likely to be older
individuals (35-64 years of age), and they were more likely
to live in households with only adult residents and to live in
a household where the householder had at least some college
education and was working full-time.
In Table 2, we show what socio-demographic groups were
more and less likely to lack high-speed residential Internet.
We present unadjusted and adjusted rates (ie, predicted prob-
abilities scaled to the percent scale) that were obtained from
logistic regressions that controlled for the predictors shown
in Tables 1 and 2, in addition to a full set of state of residence
dummies. Controlling for both rural/urban and state of resi-
dence helps to account for the fact that the supply of Internet
connections varies across geography. We omit the coeffi-
cients on sate of residence to simplify presentation and
because the independent contribution of each state to the pre-
dicted rate is not our main focus.
As shown in the first set of columns in Table 2, older indi-
viduals (aged 45-64) who were eligible or enrolled in
Medicaid/CHIP were more likely to lack residential Internet
compared with younger individuals, but the relationship
between age and the presence of residential Internet was not
linear. For example, there was not much variation by age for
those under 45, but then there was a substantial increase for
the 45- to 64-year-olds and this relationship remained after
adjustment.
Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives (AIANs)
were 1.8 times more likely to lack residential Internet com-
pared with non-Hispanic whites (44.6% vs 24.4%; P  .05).
Non-Hispanic Asians, however, were significantly less likely
to lack residential Internet, compared with Non-Hispanic
whites. After adjusting for covariates, there remained sub-
stantial racial disparities in residential Internet in the
Medicaid/CHIP population, particularly for Non-Hispanic
blacks, non-Hispanic AIANs and Hispanics. The presence of
high-speed Internet in the home also varied substantially and
significantly by household structure, education, employ-
ment, language ability, and rural status. Differences by citi-
zenship did not persist after adjustment. Even in this
relatively low-income group, family income was predictive
of home Internet. The lowest income group (below 50% of
FPL)was 8 percentage points more likely to lack residential
internet compared to the highest income group (above 138%
of poverty).
The second set of columns in Table 2 considers the popu-
lation that appeared likely to shop for a QHP. Although the
overall share that lacked residential Internet was lower for
the QHP population compared with the Medicaid eligible
population, both groups had similar demographic patterns.
For example, Non-Hispanic blacks, AIANs, and Hispanics
were significantly more likely to lack Internet compared
with Non-Hispanic whites. Just over 10% of those with at
least some college experience lacked residential Internet
compared with 29.9% of those with less than a high school
education (P  .05). There were also statistically significant

differences by household structure, education, employment,
language ability, and rural status.
As in the Medicaid/CHIP eligible group, family
income was an important predictor. After adjusting for
covariates, just over 20% of potential Marketplace par-
ticipants with relatively low incomes (100%-200% of
poverty) lacked residential high-speed Internet compared
with 12.4% of potential participants with incomes over
400% of FPL.

variability in who had high-speed Internet in the home.
African Americans, Hispanics, American Indian/Alaska
Natives, those with poor English ability, and those living in
rural areas were at particularly high risk of lacking residen-
tial Internet. These differences remained even after control-
ling for income and for potential differences in supply across
geography (as captured by our rural/urban and state of resi-
dence variables). Our study had limitations. Our data were
based on self-reports, and though the ACS has been shown to
produce health insurance and income estimates that are of
equal quality as other surveys,11,12 the quality of the new
Internet questions has not been as rigorously evaluated. We
also did not have individual data on health insurance enroll-
ment facilitated by the Marketplaces so were unable to
directly test the hypothesis that having residential Internet
increases the probability of signing up for coverage. That
remains an important area for future research.As future years
of the ACS become available, it may be possible to examine
if the ACA increased insurance coverage in Internet-
connected households to a different degree than non-con-
nected households. However, such work will need to
overcome the fact that a household's Internet status could be
correlated with unobserved factors that also help determine
insurance coverage. Simply comparing connected and non-
connected households may not represent the causal impact of
the Internet.
Millions of people have gained coverage since the open-
ing of the online Marketplaces in January of 2014, but mil-
lions of others have yet to sign up.13-15 Those interested in
obtaining coverage may utilize other application channels
(eg, phone) or may seek out the Internet away from home.
However, enrolling the remaining eligible will partially
depend on minimizing the non-financial costs of application.
Residential Internet might be the easiest option for many
consumers. Stigma associated with calling or visiting a
"social-service" office, travel time, and inconvenient office
hours are 3 barriers that residential access to online
Marketplaces could help to alleviate. Our results suggest that
a suite of new initiatives to subsidize Internet for rural popu-
lations, public housing residents, and other low-income pop-
ulations may play an important role in the ACA.1 However,
ensuring universal access to high-speed residential Internet
should not be viewed as a panacea. The groups that we iden-
tified as being the most at risk of lacking high-speed Internet
(ie, older, low-income, less educated, linguistically isolated,
and racial/ethnic populations) are likely to experience mul-
tiple barriers to enrollment, including financial and time
cost, misinformation, and distrust. Navigators and applica-
tion assisters will continue to play important roles in both
informing consumers about the benefits of coverage and edu-
cating them about appropriate health plans given family
circumstances.
Finally, though our interest centered on health insurance
enrollment under the ACA, the Internet clearly plays a much
broader role in population health. The Web is quickly
becoming an irreplaceable health resource that is essential
for managing personal health records, learning about disease
symptoms, and comparing provider quality.16,17 Our results
highlight the idea that efforts to achieve health equity should
include minimizing disparities in residential Internet access.
