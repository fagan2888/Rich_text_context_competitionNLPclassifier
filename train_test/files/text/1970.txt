Abstract--In the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a US longitudinal study of 15 000 young adults, we
examined the extent to which socioeconomic status is linked to systolic blood pressure (SBP) and whether biobehavioral
risk factors mediate the association. More than 62% of the participants had SBP 120 mm Hg and 12% had SBP
140 mm Hg. More than 66% were classified as at least overweight (body mass index 25 kg/m2), with 36% meeting
criteria for at least class I obesity (body mass index 30 kg/m2). Multivariate models showed that higher household
income and being married were independently associated with lower SBP. Higher body mass index, greater waist
circumference, smoking, and higher alcohol intake were each independently associated with higher SBP. Meditational
analyses suggested that higher education level was associated with lower SBP by way of lower body mass, smaller waist
circumference, and lower resting heart rate. When these indirect effects were accounted for, education was not
significantly associated with SBP. In contrast, household income remained associated with SBP even with control for
all of the covariates. Results reinforce current public health concerns about rates of obesity and high blood pressure
among young adults and suggest that disparities in education level and household income may play an important role
in the observed decrements in health. Identifying modifiable mechanisms that link socioeconomic status to SBP using
data from a large representative sample may improve risk stratification and guide the development of effec-
tive interventions. (Hypertension. 2011;58:161-166.)  Online Data Supplement

High blood pressure continues to be prevalent in the
United States, conferring increased morbidity and mor-
tality, for example,1,2 and remains a significant economic
burden on the healthcare system.3 Recently much attention
has been paid in the scientific literature4 and popular press5 to
substantial increases in the prevalence of biobehavioral risk
factors for high blood pressure among young adults. Al-
though advances in treatment of high blood pressure have
apparently stabilized the rates of high blood pressure for the
present,6 further elucidating how modifiable biobehavioral
risk factors are related to high blood pressure may provide
additional opportunities for maintaining or improving on
these advances in this population.
Modifiable biobehavioral risk factors for high blood pres-
sure include body mass index (BMI), waist circumference,
heart rate (HR), alcohol consumption, exercise, and smok-
ing.7 Lower socioeconomic status (SES) also has been asso-
ciated with a poorer biobehavioral risk profile and, in turn,
with higher systolic blood pressure (SBP).8­10 Recent evi-
dence from a French sample aged 30 to 79 years10 has shown
that body shape, HR, and health behaviors may account for a
sizable amount of the association between SES and SBP. In
the present study, we adopted the theoretical framework used
in the French study10 to further examine the association
between SES and SBP using data from a nationally represen-
tative sample of 15 000 young adults in the United States.
Our aims were to assess the independent predictive associa-
tion among SES indices, biobehavioral factors, and SBP and
to examine these biobehavioral risk factors as possible
mediators of the association between SBP and SES. We
focused on SBP in the present study, because SBP has been
shown to be more important than diastolic blood pressure
with respect to health risk11­13 and also possibly to be more
responsive than diastolic blood pressure to changes in mod-

improve risk stratification in clinical settings and inform
interventions aimed at reductions in social disparities in
health and also further inform the generalizability of the
association between SES and SBP across cultures and age
cohorts.
Methods
Participants
The current study uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health, a nationally representative sample of 15 000
young adults that was designed to assess the effects of health-related
behaviors during adolescence and into young adulthood. The study
was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at the
University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Written consent was
obtained for all of the data collection. The participants were followed
from grades 7 through 12 in 1995 through early adulthood in 2008
in 4 waves of data collection.15 Participants without SBP mea-
sures or survey sample weights were excluded, leaving a final
sample of 14 299.
Measures
Demographic Measures
Age and marital status (yes/no) were recorded assessed at Wave IV.
Race was constructed from a series of queries at Wave I.
SBP, Resting HR, and Cardiac Medication Use
Certified field interviewers measured respondents' resting, seated
systolic, and diastolic blood pressures (in millimeters of mercury)
and pulse rate (in beats per minute).16 After a 5-minute seated rest,
3 serial measurements were performed at 30-second intervals using
a factory calibrated, MicroLife BP3MC1-PC-IB oscillometric blood
pressure monitor (MicroLife USA, Inc, Dunedin, FL), and SBP was
constructed as the average of measures 2 and 3 and are highly
reliable.17 Cardiac medication status was assessed at the Wave IV
in-home interview.
BMI and Waist Circumference
Height, weight, and waist circumference were assessed at Wave IV.
BMI was calculated as BMIweight (in kilograms)/height (in meters
squared). BMI was modeled in its continuous form in our primary
analyses, but for descriptive purposes also was reported in the
following categories: (1) BMI 25.0normal weight; (2) 25.0 to
29.9overweight; (3) 30.0 to 34.5obese class I; (4) 35.0 to
39.5obese class II; and (5) 40.0morbidly obese.18 Waist
circumference was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm at the superior
border of the iliac crest.16
Physical Exercise, Alcohol Consumption, and
Smoking Behavior
Exercise was represented by a yes/no variable that assessed regular
(on a weekly basis) participation in any bouts of physical activity,
such as walking or strenuous sports.19 Alcohol consumption was
defined as follows: 0nondrinker; 1occasional drinker, drink 2
days of the week; 2light, drink 5 to 7 days per week and 2 drinks
(1 if female); 3moderate, drink 5 to 7 days per week, 3 drinks for
males and 2 drinks for females; and 4heavy, drink 5 to 7 days per
week, 3 drinks for males and 2 for females. Smoking was coded
yes/no, indicating current daily smoking. All of the above variables
were assessed at Wave IV, concurrent with the SBP measurement.
Individual and Parental Education
Education was coded as the highest level reported (at Wave IV for
respondent and Wave I for parent), as follows: 1some high school
or less; 2graduated high school; 3some college or vocational
tech; 4bachelor's degree; and 5some graduate school or more.
Participants completing General Educational Development tests
were grouped in the lower level of education class.20
Financial Strain, Home Ownership, Built Environment,
and Household Income
Income, financial strain, and home ownership were assessed at Wave
IV. Financial strain was derived from 6 questions that assessed
whether individuals reported the inability to pay bills, buy food, and
so forth. A "built environment" measure (rated by the field inter-
viewer) was the sum of 2 Likert-type items assessed at Wave I
regarding how well the building in which the respondent lived was
maintained and the surrounding buildings were maintained. The
summed score had a possible range of 2 to 8, with higher scores
reflecting poorer maintenance. Annual household income was as-
sessed using ordered categories. To create an ordinal income
measure, we assigned the midpoint value to each category, resulting
in the 13 values ranging from $2500 to more than $150 000.
Statistical Analysis
Sample characteristics were described as median (interquartile
range) for continuous variables and frequency (percentage) for
categorical measures. Analyses were carried out using SAS version
9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC), R software (http://cran.r-project.
org), and Mplus.21 Statistical models were weighted using grand
sample weights and adjusted for individual school membership. We
first conducted a series of linear regression models estimating the
independent associations between the predictor variables and SBP,
first adjusted for only age, sex, and cardiac medication, and then
adjusted for all of the predictors under study, a "full" model. To
capture nonlinearity for several variables we used a piecewise
regression or "hockey stick" approach.
We then estimated a path model in which the associations between
respondent education and household income on SBP were mediated
by the biobehavioral variables. Significance tests were 2 sided, and
a value of P0.05 was considered "significant."
Further details on the above assessments and statistical analy-
ses can be found in the online Data Supplement at
http://hyper.ahajournals.org.
Results
Table 1 shows the unweighted sample characteristics. The
majority of participants were white women, with mean age of
29 years. Median SBP was 123.5 mm Hg, and median BMI
was 27.6. Approximately 3.7% of the sample was taking
some form of cardiac medication. More than 62% of the
participants had SBP 120 mm Hg and 12% had SBP
140 mm Hg. More than 66% were classified as at least
overweight (BMI: 25.0 to 29.9).
Predictors of SBP
Among the background variables, black race/ethnicity, male
sex, age, and taking cardiac medication were positively
associated with higher SBP (see Table 2). Adjusting only for
age, sex, and cardiac medication, financial strain, built
environment, alcohol intake, tobacco smoking, BMI, resting
HR, and waist circumference were associated with SBP,
whereas higher respondent and parental education, owning a
home, being married, regular exercise, and annual household
income were inversely associated with SBP.
In the fully adjusted model, the background variables age,
male sex, cardiac medication use, and black race remained
significantly, positively associated with SBP. Annual income
and being married maintained their significant negative asso-
ciation with SBP, whereas moderate and heavy alcohol intake
remained strongly associated with higher SBP. Cigarette
smoking also was associated with higher SBP. Strong, inde-
pendent associations were observed for BMI and waist
circumference (see Figure 1), with higher values correspond-

ing with higher SBP. Higher resting HR was also associated
with higher SBP, although the P value was 0.06.
Mediation path model results are displayed in Figure 2.
Estimates for respondent education (top panel) and household
income (bottom panel) were produced from a single model
that included all of the variables simultaneously but are
separated in Figure 2 for presentational clarity. Higher levels
of respondent education were associated with lower BMI,
lower resting HR, less smoking, and more frequent exercise.
Higher education level was associated with greater alcohol
intake. The indirect effects of respondent education through
BMI and through resting HR were statistically significant
(see Table S2, available in the online Data Supplement at
http://hyper.ahajournals.org). For every one category increase
in education, there was roughly a 0.50-mm Hg decrease in
SBP by way of BMI and a 0.20-mm Hg decrease by way of
resting HR. In contrast, for every one level increase in
education, there also was a 0.13-mm Hg increase in SBP by
way of alcohol intake. The indirect effects of education
through exercise and smoking were not statistically signifi-
cant. Waist circumference and BMI were not simultaneously
modeled because of their strong correlation. We, therefore,
re-estimated the primary path model replacing BMI with the
waist measure. In this model, education was inversely asso-
ciated with waist circumference (unstandardized path coeffi-
cient2.71; 95% CI3.20 to 2.26). The unstandard-
ized indirect effect for education via waist was 0.64 (95%
CI0.76 to 0.53). (The primary path model also specified
indirect effects of education on SBP by way of household
income and biobehavioral variables; these associations were
all trivial in magnitude and not statistically significant.) The
overall indirect effect of education across the entire set of
biobehavioral variables was 0.91 (95% CI1.19 to
0.63). Finally, after accounting for all of the indirect effects
via biobehavioral mediators, the direct effect of respondent
education on SBP was no longer statistically significant.
Combining the direct effect with all of the indirect effects
yielded a total effect for education on SBP of 0.59 (95%
CI0.91 to 0.26).
Higher household income was associated with lower rest-
ing HR and higher alcohol intake (see Figure 2). In contrast
to respondent education, although the specific indirect effects
of income by way of alcohol and resting HR were statistically
significant (see bottom section of Table S2), the total indirect
effect was not. Moreover, the direct effect was statistically
significant, with each $50 000 increase associated with a
decrease in SBP of 0.61 mm Hg. The total effect of
household income on SBP was 0.74 (95% CI1.19 to
0.29) and statistically significant. As with BMI, income
was inversely associated with waist circumference (unstan-
dardized path coefficient1.71; 95% CI2.43 to
1.03). The unstandardized indirect effect of household
income on SBP via waist circumference was also significant
(0.41; 95% CI0.54 to 0.24).
Discussion
A striking number of these young adults displayed clinically
relevant elevations in both SBP and BMI. Among the most
noteworthy findings from the conventional regression model
was that, among the SES indices, only income and marital
status remained significantly related to SBP after adjustment
for biobehavioral risk factors and other SES indicators. Our
findings regarding the mediating path from education level to
SBP by way of BMI, resting HR, and alcohol consumption
are consistent with those of Chaix et al.10 However, our

§Coefficients involving BMI, waist circumference, and heart rate are from a linear piecewise (hockey stick) estimate
in which the regression slope is allowed to bend once at an inflection point. This procedure generates 2 coefficients
for each variable, each coefficient representing the 2 different slope regions. For example, in column 1, the coefficient
for waist circumference 100 (second column) is 0.32, which is the regression slope for individuals whose waist
circumferences is 100 cm. The coefficient for waist circumference 100 represents the change in that slope for
individuals whose waist circumference is 100 cm. Above 100 cm, the slope is 0.16 less steep than the slope for
waist circumference 100 cm, that is, the slope for waist circumference beyond 100 cm is 0.33(0.16)0.14.

findings diverge from the French study in that we did not find
that the total effect of household income on SBP was
accounted for by these indirect biobehavioral mediators. This
discrepancy may be the result of cultural differences between
French and American cultures, the younger age of our
sample, and/or our larger sample size. In addition, the
availability of government-sponsored healthcare in France,
for example, could have buffered the SBP-raising effects of
lower household income there. Another intriguing possibility
is that the recent economic recession resulted in loss of jobs
and diminished household income among National Longitu-
dinal Study of Adolescent Health participants at just about the
time that the Wave IV data collection was under way, thereby
potentiating the impact of such a recent reduction in house-
hold income on SBP. Supporting this possibility is the recent
report22 that there was an increase in acute myocardial
infarction rates during the stock market decline of October
2008 to April 2009.

Our findings may have important implications for approaches
to prevention of high blood pressure. Mediation of the low
education association with SBP via increased BMI and waist
circumference is consistent with the long-recognized importance
of steps to decrease BMI and central obesity in any cardiopre-
ventive program. The independent effect of lower HR to mediate
the effects of both low education and household income on SBP
points to the importance of also identifying interventions that can
reduce resting HR. One such intervention is aerobic exercise,
which is also long recognized as an important cardiopreventive
measure.
Finally, the emergence of smoking, being married, and
increased alcohol consumption as independent correlates of SBP
points to the importance of smoking cessation and limiting
alcohol consumption as potentially important preventive ap-
proaches. The salutatory effects of marriage and social support
in general have been widely studied, for example,23 with the
majority of findings being consistent with ours.
The cross-sectional nature of this study precludes conclu-
sions regarding causality, and the present findings may
generalize only to individuals 24 to 32 years of age. In
addition, as with any observational study, unmeasured factors
may have significantly contributed to the present associa-
tions. For example, genetic profiles could be associated with
SES, as well as SBP.
Perspectives
We have shown that indices of lower SES are associated with
increased SBP and that increased BMI and waist circumfer-
ence and higher resting HR are significant mediators of these
associations. These findings strengthen the case that lower
SES is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and that
increased BMI and central obesity are important mediators of
this effect. Interventions that promote weight loss and reduce
resting HR have the potential to reduce the impact of low SES
on SBP, especially among young adults, which will further
reduce the cardiovascular health burden of the US population
as they age into middle and older adulthood.
