Background. As people age, fat becomes preferentially deposited in the abdominal region over the periphery, and such
changes are thought to be associated with adverse metabolic outcomes. We were interested in whether body mass index (EMI)
and waist-hip ratio (WHR) are differentially associated with fasting insulin levels, triglycerides, and blood pressure (systolic
and diastolic) in an older population. We were also interested in whether these associations change after controlling for genetic
influences.
Methods. Data were obtained as part of the Swedish Adoption/fwin Study of Aging. All blood samples and anthropometric
measures were assessed from 1989-1991 except insulin, which was assessed from 1986-1988. The sample contains 263'twin
pairs (97 monozygotic and 166 dizygotic), 56% women, average age 65 years.
Results. In men and women, WHR and BMI were significantly associated with all the metabolic variables except for dias-
tolic blood pressure. When BMI's association with the metabolic variables was assessed independent ofWHR, it remained sig-
nificantly associated with all metabolic variables except diastolic blood pressure in men and triglycerides in women. When
WHR's association with the metabolic variables was assessed independent of BMI, it did not remain significantly associated
with any of the metabolic variables in men and remained significantly associated with insulin and diastolic pressure in women.
After controlling for genetic effects, the relationship between WHR and the metabolic variables became nonsignificant.
However, BMI remained significantly associated with systolic blood pressure and triglycerides in men, independent ofWHR,
Conclusion. The results suggest that overall body fat is important to consider in relation to these metabolic parameters in
older individuals. The results also suggest that BMI may share associations with blood pressure and triglycerides beyond those
that can be attributed to familial influences.
OBESITY has been associated with numerous chronic con-
ditions including non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
(NIDDM), cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. However,
research over the past 15 years has shown that abdominal obe-
sity is more highly related to these chronic conditions than over-
all obesity. For example, persons with a high waist-hip ratio
(WHR) (measure of abdominal fatness) have a higher incidence
of NIDDM, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperten-
sion, and ischemic heart disease than those with peripheral obe-
sity (1-5). There is still evidence, however, that general obesity
is important; Young and Gelskey (6) found that noncentrally
obese men did not differ from centrally obese men in levels of
blood pressure and plasma lipids.
The clustering of these variables is often called the metabolic
syndrome, or syndrome X. Whether one disorder initiates the
others or whether the clustering of these relationships is due to
genetic effects is still unclear. There are known to be genetic in-
fluences on body mass index [BMI (7-9)], WHR (10,11), blood
pressure (12,13), triglycerides (14), and fasting insulin levels
(15), and these genetic effects may be in common to several of
the measures (10,13,15,16).
It is important to address these issues, as aging is associated
with increased total fat mass, particularly in the abdominal area
(17,18). We were interested in whether BMI and WHR were
differentially associated with fasting insulin levels, triglyc-
erides, and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) in this older
M446
Swedish twin population. We were also interested in whether
there were any associations between BMI, WHR, and the
metabolic variables after controlling for genetic influences.
METHODS
Data for this study came from the Swedish Adoptionffwin
Study of Aging (SATSA). The SATSA sample of twins was
identified through the Swedish Twin Registry, which includes
information on almost 25,000 pairs of like-sexed twins born in
Sweden during 1886-1958 (19). The SATSA subregistry was
formed in 1984 by contacting twin pairs identified in the
Swedish Twin Registry as having been reared apart, along with
matched pairs reared together. The identification and character-
ization of the SATSA sample has been described in detail else-
where (20). In-person testing was conducted in three waves:
1986-1988, 1989-1991, and 1992-1994. All measures for this
study were taken from the second wave of in-person testing ob-
tained in 1989-1991 except for measures of insulin, which
were obtained from the 1986-1988 measurement. There were
originally 266 complete twin pairs; however, after deleting
those pairs where at least one twin was using insulin, there were
263 twin pairs. There were 114 male pairs with 46 monozy-
gotic (MZ) and 68 dizygotic (DZ) and 149 female pairs (51
MZ and 98 DZ). The average age was 65 years, with a range
of 45-89 years. Further details of SATSA are described by
Pedersen et al. (21).
IMPLICATIONS OF BODY FAT DISTRIBUTION M447
WHR was determined by dividing waist measurement by
hip measurements. The waist circumference was obtained at
the smallest part of the waist, and hip circumference at the
widest point between the hip and buttock. BMI was calculated
as weight (kg) divided by height (m-), Height (m) and weight
(kg) were obtained from subjects dressed in lightweight clothes
with their shoes removed.
Serum insulin was measured using a radioimmunoassay
technique (RIA 100, Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Blood pres-
sure was obtained twice by trained nurses using a mercury
sphygmomanometer with a cuff size of 17 em by 67 em with
the subject in a supine position after 5 minutes of rest. The fifth-
phase Korotkoff sound was used as the diastolic reading. The
pressure was read to the nearest 2 mmHg. Serum triglycerides
were measured with an enzymatic calorimetric assay
(Boehringer-Mannhein automated analysis for Hitachi system
717, Diagnostica, Mannheim, Germany).
StatisticalAnalysis
Descriptive analyses and co-twin control analyses were per-
formed using SAS software (22). The following variables were
log transformed due to their skewed distributions: BMI, triglyc-
eride levels, and fasting insulin levels. We used a multiple-
group linear regression model to estimate the model coeffi-
cients and standard errors using maximum likelihood
estimation. The LISREL 8 (23) statistical package was used.
Twin pairs with data for only one individual were deleted, as
LISREL cannot use missing data. Covariance matrices were
adjusted for age and used as input, and men and women were
modeled separately. The following dependent variables were
used: log transformed fasting insulin levels, log transformed
triglyceride levels, and blood pressure (systolic [SBP] and dias-
tolic [DBP]). WHR and BMI were used as the independent
variables in separate analyses. Analyses were also performed
with both WHR and BMI in the same model to assess each
variable's association with the metabolic factors independent of
the other. The correlation ofWHR and BMI was relatively high
(males r= .52,p < .0001; females r:=! Al,p < .00(1).
Genetically informative samples such as this are typically
used to estimate genetic and environmental sources of variance;
however, when such data are used for traditional analyses, such
as the regression models in this study, the dependence among
the sample becomes problematic rather than informative.
Dependence among the sample can bias the estimates by de-
creasing the standard errors of the estimates, thus biasing to-
ward type I error (24,25). In twin studies, this problem is typi-
cally dealt with by using only one twin of the pair at the
expense of losing half of the data. Eliminating subjects is un-
necessary because this source of bias is known and can be con-
trolled. This can be achieved by estimating the residual covari-
ance within a twin pair. [A marked increase in the standard
errors is noted when analysis adjusting for dependence is com-
pared to the unadjusted standard error (26).] Identical and fra-
ternal twins are treated as separate groups so that the residual
covariance can be modeled separately, while the regression co-
efficients are constrained to be equal across groups (27).
A co-twin control analysis was also performed in the identi-
cal pairs to determine whether WHR and BMI had similar as-
sociations with the dependent variables after controlling for ge-
netic effects. Because identical twins share 100% of their genes,
any intrapair differences in measures of the dependent variables
can be attributed to nongenetic variation in the independent
variables. A linear regression analysis was performed where the
dependent variables were intrapair difference in insulin levels,
triglyceride levels, and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic)
and the independent variables were intrapair differences in
WHRandBMI.
REsULTS
The descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. The mean
values for all variables are about average for an older adult pop-
ulation.
In Table 2, standardized estimates of regression coefficients
are presented along with t values for the univariate association of
fasting insulin levels, SBP, DBP, and triglycerides with BMI and
WHR. In men, BMI and WHR were significantly associated
with insulin, SBP, and triglycerides, whereas only BMI was sig-
nificantly associated with DBP. In women, BMI and WHR were
also significantly associated with insulin, SBP, and triglycerides
but only WHR was significantly associated with DBP.

Table 3 shows the standard estimates and t values with both
WHR and BMI in the same model. This analysis was per-
formed only in the MZ twin pairs so it could be compared to
the co-twin control analyses. We found that in men, BMI was
stillsignificantly associated with insulin, SBP, and triglycerides
independent of WHR, whereas WHR was not significantly as-
sociated with any of the metabolic variables independent of
BMI. In women, we found that BMI was still significantly as-
sociated with insulin and SBP independent ofWHR, and WHR
was still significantly associated with insulin and DBP indepen-
dentofBMI.
Genetic effects were controlled for in a co-twin control anal-
ysis (Table 4). We found, in men, that BMI was independently
associated with SBP and triglycerides after controlling for ge-
netic influences, and WHR was not associated with any of the
variables after controlling for genetic influences. We need to in-
terpret the results in women with caution, as we found that BMI
became significantly associated with DBP after controlling for
genetic effects; however, all other associations became non-
significant as they did in men. Overall, these findings suggest
that BMI may share influences with blood pressure and triglyc-
erides beyond those attributed to familial similarities, whereas
WHR does not appear to share such nonfamilial influences.
DISCUSSION
Overall, these results suggest that in older men and women,
overall body fat and abdominal fat are both associated with the

metabolic factors. When BMI and WHR are analyzed indepen-
dently, men have a greater number of significant associations
between BMI and the metabolic factors than between WHR
and the metabolic factors. Women have a similar number of
significant associations for WHR and BMI and the metabolic
factors. These results also suggest that BMI shares nonfamilial
influences to a greater extent with blood pressure and triglyc-
erides than the other metabolic variables.
The relationship ofWHR with these metabolic factors has
been documented extensively over the past few years. Fat lo-
cated in the abdominal area, specifically the visceral adipocytes,
has been shown to be more atherogenic than fat located in other
areas of the body (1-5). Although we could not directly mea-
sure the visceral adipocytes, the WHR has been shown to be a
good indicator of abdominal fat and the associated metabolic
variables (4). Interestingly we found that in men, the overall fat
measure indicated by BMI was significantly related to more of
the metabolic variables than was WHR. In interpreting these
findings we must be careful, however, because of the limita-
tions in our measure of abdominal fat. Aging is associated with
changes in body fat distribution toward the abdominal area,
particularly increases in visceral fat (4,18). Although these men
are not considered centrally obese, they still could have a large
amount of visceral or deep fat. Overall, these results suggest
that peripheral fat, as indicated by BMI, is an important marker
of metabolic parameters in aging individuals; however, we can-
not discount WHR as an important consideration. Young and
Gelskey (6) found both WHR and BMI to independently pre-
dict blood pressure, triglycerides, and fasting glucose levels in
men and women with an age range 18-74 years.
In women, WHR is significantly associated with the same
number of metabolic variables as BMI. Women, in general, do
not have the amount of abdominal fat as men, although more
fat is deposited in the abdominal area, particularly the visceral
depots, as they become postmenopausal. Although we did not
have direct measures of menopausal status, the average age of
this population was 65 years-suggesting most of the women
in this population were postmenopausal. As stated earlier, we
could not directly measure the type of adipocytes, and thus our
conclusions are limited regarding the amount of visceral fat
these women may have; but as in the men, these results sug-
gest BMI is important to consider in relation to the metabolic
parameters.
The relationship of these variables is still not completely un-
derstood. It could be that insulin resistance is the initiator of
high triglyceride levels and increased blood pressure. This has
been hypothesized by several people including Raven and col-
leagues (28,29), Ferrannini and associates (30), and DeFronzo
and Ferrannini (31). In this study, both BMI and WHR are as-
sociated with higher fasting insulin levels to about the same de-
gree; therefore, both BMI and WHR could be involved in initi-
ating insulin resistance, which in tum could influence the other
metabolic variables.
The co-twin control analyses were used to determine
whether associations remained once genetic influences of im-
portance to the dependent and independent variables were con-
trolled. A finding of no association in these analyses suggests
that there may have been genetic influences shared by the mea-
sures. Because almost all significant associations between BMI
and WHR and the metabolic variables dropped out after con-
trolling for genetic influences, this study indicates that there
may be unique genetic influences or common genetic influ-
ences between both WHR and BMI and the other metabolic
variables. It could also be that there is some underlying liability
whereby the insulin levels or both abdominal fatness and over-
all fatness reach a threshold, and this "turns on" other genetic
effects that alter the other metabolic measures. The potential for
shared genetic influences among these variables has been seen
in other studies: Carmelli and coworkers (16) found, in a sam-
ple of male twins, that a common latent factor explained the
clustering of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Fifty-nine per-
cent of the variation in the latent factor was genetic variation,
the remaining being environmental. In the San Antonio Family
Heart Study (10), the genetic correlations were high among
fasting insulin levels, BMI, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL) level, WHR, and triglycerides, indicating that the same
gene or set of genes may influence these traits. Finally, Hong
and associates (13) found, using data also from SATSA, shared
genetic effects on BMI, insulin resistance, triglycerides, HDL
cholesterol and systolic blood pressure; BMI and insulin resis-
tance shared genetic effects to the greatest extent.
In males, the nongenetic or, more specifically, nonfamilial
effects shared between BMI and blood pressure and BMI and
triglycerides are important to consider, as presence of these ef-
fects suggests that these variables may cluster more as a result
of nonfamilial environmental factors. Such influences would
include factors within individuals that affect both BMI and
blood pressure and BMI and triglycerides independent of
shared environmental or genetic factors. It may be that BMI
reaches a certain threshold whereby the individual becomes in-
sulin resistant. This insulin resistance produces hyperinsuline-
mia, and the hyperinsulinemia then affects the renin-an-
M450 NELSON ETAL.
giotensin system causing sodium reabsorption, which eventu-
ally leads to hypertension (32,33). Insulin also has been shown
to cause vascular smooth muscle proliferation (34) as well as
increases in plasma catecholamine concentration, which also
may increase blood pressure. The insulin resistance and hyper-
insulinemia may also affect triglyceride levels by increasing
free fatty acid release from adipocytes, which then act as sub-
strate for triglyceride synthesis (2, 28).
Mayer and associates (15) found in female twins, after con-
trolling for genetic effects, BMI to be associated with fasting
insulin levels. They also found, after controlling for BMI, atten-
uation of the correlations between insulin, triglycerides, and
blood pressure. The findings suggest that overall body fatness
may playa significant role in the development of the other
metabolic factors.
The next step is to evaluate, through a quantitative genetic
analysis, how much of the variance is genetic and how much
genetic variance may be shared among these variables. Hong
and coworkers (13) have already performed such analyses at an
earlier time point for BMI, insulin resistance, systolic blood
pressure, triglycerides, and HDL in the SATSA sample, as de-
scribed earlier. However, further work including WHR and ob-
taining separate estimates for men and women is necessary.
Future work in this area also needs to clearly distinguish be-
tween visceral adipocytes and subcutaneous adipoyctes (both
abdominal and peripheral) and the extent to which metabolic
problems are associated with each as well as whether these as-
sociations change for middle-aged to older individuals.
