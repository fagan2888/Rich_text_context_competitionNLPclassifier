Abstract
The 2010 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee has recommended that no more than 5­15% of total dietary energy
should be derived from solid fats and added sugars (SoFAS). The guideline was based on USDA food pattern modeling
analyses that met the Dietary Reference Intake recommendations and Dietary Guidelines and followed typical American
eating habits. This study recreated food intake patterns for 6 of the same gender-age groups by using USDA data sources
and a mathematical optimization technique known as linear programming. The analytic process identified food
consumption patterns based on 128 food categories that met the nutritional goals for 9 vitamins, 9 minerals, 8
macronutrients, and dietary fiber and minimized deviation from typical American eating habits. Linear programming Model
1 created gender- and age-specific food patterns that corresponded to energy needs for each group. Model 2 created food
patterns that were iso-caloric with diets observed for that group in the 2001­2002 NHANES. The optimized food patterns
were evaluated with respect to MyPyramid servings goals, energy density [kcal/g (1 kcal = 4.18 kJ)], and energy cost (US
$/2000 kcal). The optimized food patterns had more servings of vegetables and fruit, lower energy density, and higher cost
compared with the observed diets. All nutrient goals were met. In contrast to the much lower USDA estimates, the 2
models placed SoFAS allowances at between 17 and 33% of total energy, depending on energy needs. J. Nutr. 141:

Introduction
Solid fats and added sugars (SoFAS)3 contribute ~35% of energy
to the typical American diet (1,2). Providing most of the
nonessential energy and few nutrients, SoFAS are said to be the
root cause of dietary imbalance (1). The 2010 Dietary Guide-
lines Advisory Committee set SoFAS allowances at between 5
and 15% of energy intakes, depending on energy needs (1).
SoFAS allowances have replaced discretionary calories,
featured in the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (1­5).
Calculations of discretionary energy had been based on modeled
food patterns (6) that met known nutrient needs, promoted
moderation and balance, and took American food habits into
account (7). Following a decision framework used to develop the
Food Guide Pyramid (8), USDA researchers adjusted food group
amounts when needed until a pattern either met the nutritional
goals or came within a reasonable range (4). Decisions were
based on the researchers' judgments of which food groups might
reasonably provide the nutrients in question when the nutri-
tional goals were not met (4). Further alterations were made to
make food patterns conform better to educational goals (4,8).
An alternative approach to translating nutritional goals into
food patterns is based on nonlinear or linear programming (LP)
(9,10). Awell-described diet optimization technique (11­14) has
been used to create the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) (2,15) and other
USDA food plans at different levels of cost (16­18). LP models
take into account, simultaneously, nutritional goals, American
eating habits, and cost constraints (19­21). This study recalcu-
lated SoFAS allowances in modeled food patterns that met
nutritional goals and took existing food selections into account.
Following Britten et al. (4), separate food patterns were created
for 6 gender-age groups. For each group, modeled patterns were
created for 2 energy levels: recommended and observed.
Materials and Methods
In the present study, procedures used to develop MyPyramid food
patterns (4) were followed (Fig. 1).
Establishing energy levels
The 6 gender-age groups were men and women aged 20­30 y; 31­50 y,
and .50 y. Observed energy intakes for the 6 groups were based on 24-h

recall from the 2001­2002 NHANES (22). The NHANES sample of
4295 individuals excluded pregnant women and persons consuming
,600 kcal/d (23). Estimated energy requirements for each group were
based on IOM (24) and USDA (3) standards (2000­2400 kcal for men
and 1600­2000 kcal for women).
Establishing food groupings
Food groupings were based only on those foods that were consumed by
NHANES participants. The number of foods consumed by NHANES
2001­2002 participants varied depending on gender-age groups (from
1129 to 2171 foods). Baby foods, alcohol, medical foods and supple-
ments, electrolyte solutions, chewing gum, and foods with an energy
density , 10 kcal/100 g (e.g. water, coffee, tea) were excluded. Nutrient
composition of foods was obtained from the USDA Food and Nutrient
Database 1.0 (FNDDS 1.0).
Individual foods consumed by each age-gender group of NHANES
participants were aggregated into 128 food categories, 39 food
subgroups, and 9 major food groups. The groupings largely followed
the USDA coding system in FNDDS. The number of food categories
varied from 85 to 128, whereas the number of food subgroups varied
from 35 to 39. Consistent with the original Pyramid food groupings, the
9 major food groups were fruits; vegetables; meat, poultry, and fish; eggs;
dry beans, legumes, nuts and seeds; milk, yogurt, and cheese; bread,
cereal, rice, and pasta; fats and oils; and sweets. FNDDS food codes and
subcodes may better correspond to what people eat in America than do
more idealized food groupings developed by Marcoe et al. (25) and used
in the Britten (4) process.
Establishing nutrient profiles and unit price (US$/100 g) of food
categories
Nutrient profiles for each food category were calculated based on a
weighted average of the nutrient contribution of each food, as based on
the FNDDS 1.0 nutrient composition data (26) and frequency of
occurrence in the 2001­2002 NHANES (2,4,15,27). The weights were
assigned based on the relative amounts consumed. Values for solid fat
and added sugar embedded in foods were obtained from the MyPyramid
Equivalents Database (28) for USDA Survey Food Codes (version 1.0).
The amount of added sugar in grams was calculated using a conversion
factor of 4.2 (1 teaspoon = 4.2 g).
National food prices per 100 g of food, edible portion, were obtained
from the 2001­2002 Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion Prices
database (29). The price per 100 g for each food category was calculated
based on the weighted average of the unit price of each food. The weights
were assigned based on the amounts consumed.
Establishing nutritional goals
Age- and gender-specific DRI values (30­33) were used for fiber, vitamins
A, C, and E, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B-6, folate, and vitamin
B-12 and for calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, selenium,
zinc, potassium, and sodium. Because the potassium standard (4.7 g/d) is
difficult to meet (4) it was relaxed to 90% of adequate intake (AI) (i.e.
4.23 g/d) following procedures adopted by the Thrifty Food Plan (15).
Population-wide standards were used for protein, total carbohydrates,
total lipids, SFA, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, cholesterol, and added
sugar (24). These nutritional goals are summarized in Table 1.
Establishing consumption constraints
Gender- and age-specific consumption constraints were placed on food
groups and subgroups and on each food category. Optimized amounts
for the 9 food groups were flanked by the 10th and 90th percentiles of
the observed consumption in the referent age-gender group (Table 1).
Upper bounds for food subgroups and food categories were set by the
75th percentile of observed consumption of the referent age-gender
group (Table 1).
Stringent criteria were imposed on introducing unfamiliar foods into
the optimized food patterns. If a given food group or category was not
consumed at all by a given age-gender group, it was not included in the
optimized food intake patterns for that group.
The LP models
Model 1 produced optimized food patterns for the 6 gender-age groups
by setting energy intakes at the recommended levels (4). Model 2

produced optimized food patterns by setting energy intakes at the levels
observed for each group in the NHANES dataset. The LP models are
summarized in Figure 2.
Decision variables and objective function. The LP model was based
on 85­128 food categories (i.e. decision variables). The objective function
measured the deviation between current consumption and the optimized
food pattern for that age-gender group. The objective function was the
sum of the absolute relative deviation (Dj
) from each food subgroup j:

To apply LP, the objective function was transformed into a linear
function using a method based on goal programming, as described
elsewhere (17,20). For this purpose, new decision variables (2 <+) P1
to
Pj
and N1
to NJ
, which represented the positive and the negative
deviations from observed food subgroup quantity, were substituted to
the absolute deviations Dj
. The final linear function called F9 was
expressed as the sum of deviational variables (Fig. 2).
Deviational variable constraints. The new decisions variables called
PJ
and NJ
were obtained adding a constraint (for each j), which defined
the deviation between the observed amount of a food subgroup j and the
amount of the same food subgroup in the optimized food pattern.
Energy constraints. In Model 1, the energy constraint was fixed equal
to the energy requirement as established by the USDA for each age-
gender group, following Britten et al. (4). In Model 2, the energy
constraint was fixed equal to the average observed energy intake for that
group in the NHANES dataset.
Nutrient recommendations. Nutritional goals or constraints, outlined
in Table 1, ensured for each food pattern the achievement of the DRI for
fibers, 9 vitamins, 9 minerals, proteins, total carbohydrates, total lipids,
linoleic acid, linolenic acid, cholesterol, SFA, and added sugars.
Consumption constraints. Consumption constraints, gender and age
specific, ensured that the optimized food patterns did not deviate too
much from the usual eating habits of the American population. Each
food category was limited to the 75th observed percentile whereas each
food subgroup and food groups was limited to the observed 90th
percentile of the observation distribution depending on gender-age
groups. All optimized food patterns were computed with the Simplex
method, which is implemented in the "proc optlp" procedure available
in the Operational Research package of SAS version 9.2 (2009, SAS
Institute).
Evaluating model performance
The first set of analyses, conducted with Models 1 and 2, measured
compliance with MyPyramid goals. The observed diets and the food
patterns were therefore converted into the MyPyramid food groups:
fruits, vegetables, grains (whole and refined), meats and beans, milk and
milk products, and oils. The second set of analyses, conducted with
Model 2, addressed dietary energy density, and energy cost. For each age-
gender group, dietary energy density (kcal/g), daily cost (US$/d) and
FIGURE 2 Description of the LP model.

energy cost (US$/2000 kcal) were computed for the observed diets and
the optimized food patterns. Two kinds of energy density calculation
were used. Energy density based on all foods (including liquid foods) was
called total energy density (kcal/g), whereas energy density based on
solid food only (34) was called solid energy density (kcal/g). In the 3rd set
of analyses, SoFAS energy for each model and for each of the 6 food
patterns were calculated as percentages of total daily energy (3,4).
All food patterns were expressed in percentage of DRI. Nutrients
were identified as limiting when the amount of nutrient in the optimized
pattern was exactly equal to the DRI.
Results
Each modeled food pattern satisfied the DRI for 9 vitamins and 9
minerals and was within the recommended ranges for protein,
carbohydrate, fats, and essential fatty acids. Values for added
sugars, SFA, cholesterol, and sodium were at or below the
recommended levels (Table 1).
Model 1: recommended energy levels. In all 6 patterns, fruit
and vegetable servings were close to or in excess of MyPyramid
recommendations (Table 2). Model 1 favored vegetables and
fruit more than any other food group. By contrast, numbers of
servings for milk, yogurt, and cheese were below MyPyramid
values. Servings of meat, poultry, and fish were below
MyPyramid values for the 20- to 30-y age groups and above
recommended values for older adults. Total grains servings
(including whole grains) were low, in part because the grains
group was high in sodium and low in potassium.
The present estimates placed SoFAS at between 273 and
606 kcal/d, which contrasted with the estimates of SoFAS in
MyPyramid food patterns ranging from 132 to 362 kcal/d (Table
2) (3,4).
Model 2: observed energy levels. Food patterns that were
isoenergetic with the observed diets were created by Model 2.
The observed consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains,
and milk, yogurt, and cheese fell short of MyPyramid recom-
mendations, whereas refined grains and meat products were
consumed in excess (Table 3). In the observed diets, energy
derived from SoFAS ranged from 483 to 1045 kcal, depending
on age and gender. Consistent with previous reports (1,2), SoFAS
accounted for between 32 and 39% of total daily energy intakes.
Food patterns for men, optimized using Model 2, had more
servings of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and fewer
servings of refined grains and meats. The number of servings for
milk and milk products increased for older men . 50 y. In
nutritionally adequate diets, SoFAS allowances were between
378 and 869 kcal, representing a decrease of 200­300 kcal
relative to observed values.
Food patterns for women had more servings of fruits,
vegetables, and whole grains. For women in all age groups, the
optimized food patterns contained more servings of meats and
milk and milk products. SoFAS allowances were between 261
and 343 kcal, representing a decrease of 200­400 kcal relative to
observed values.
Other characteristics of food patterns. The observed solid
energy density decreased with age group (range, 2.2 to 1.9 kcal/g
for men and 2.1 to 1.8 kcal/g for women), whereas the observed
energy cost per 2000 kcal increased with age group (from US
$3.8 to US$4.1 for men and from US$4.2 to US$4.8 for women).
Consistent with past studies (14,17,20), the optimized food
patterns that were isocaloric with observed diets were lower in
energy density and higher in daily diet costs and energy costs.

intakes was associated with an increase of daily diet cost ranging
from US$0.1 to US$1.2/d (Table 3).
MyPyramid SoFAS allowances, set by the USDA, ranged
from 8.3 to 15.8% of total energy, depending on energy level
(Table 4). The present allowances were between 17.1 and 32.8%
of total energy intakes depending on energy intakes.
Identifying limiting nutrients. The USDA food patterns (4)
met almost all nutrient goals, with the exception of potassium,
sodium, and vitamin E. These can be regarded as limiting
nutrients. Potassium, sodium, and vitamin E were also the limiting
nutrients in the present models (Table 5). For calcium and sodium,
the optimized diets were at exactly 100% DRI. Vitamin A was a
limiting nutrient only for men. The present modeling analyses
would suggest that calcium, potassium, vitamin E, and fiber may
be nutrients of concern in the American diet.
Discussion
Based on the present LP model, optimized food patterns that
meet all nutrient requirements contained up to 33% of energy
from SoFAS, depending on energy level. The present estimates
placed SoFAS allowances at between 17.1 and 32.8% of energy
intakes, values in sharp contrast with the 2010 Dietary Guidelines
Advisory Committee SoFAS allowances of 5­15% of energy (1).
The present LP models were in strict compliance with
existing U.S. recommendations and guidelines. For example,
the maximal amount of added sugars in the optimized food
patterns was between 6.4 and 21.5% of total energy, below the
25% guidelines set by the IOM for the US (24). There are
concerns that this value may be overly lax (35). It may be
worthwhile to recalculate SoFAS using the stricter 10% guide-
line for added sugars, as set by the WHO (36) and the French
authorities (37). However, even then, the likely SoFAS allowance
is going to be higher than the 5­15% limit, due to the presence of
solid fats in many nutrient-dense foods.
The LP methodology (9,10) offers an alternative approach to
food pattern modeling (4). The present food patterns met all
nutritional goals within prespecified energy needs, either
recommended (Model 1) or observed (Model 2). The differences

cups (237­474 mL) of vegetables, and 0.5­1 oz eq (14­28 g) of
whole grains, and decreases of 2­5 oz eq (56­140 g) of refined
grains].
The present LP model differed in some important respects
from past procedures (2,4,38). First, the principle that food
patterns had to resemble American food selections, also
espoused by the TFP and by Britten et al. (4), was strictly
applied. Setting the objective function to minimize distance from
the current consumption, similarly to TFP modeling, is the
standard way to respect existing eating habits, an ostensible
USDA goal. Consumption constraints prevented the model from
selecting food categories that were never consumed by the
referent population. Only those foods that were actually
consumed by the different age-gender groups in the NHANES
data were allowed to enter into the model and strict limits on
consumption amounts were set to guard against unrealistic
deviations from current eating habits. By contrast, the TFP had
allowed for 10-fold increases in the consumption of selected
foods, raising the question whether its low cost targets were
achieved at the expense of ignoring both cultural and social
norms (2). Britten et al. (4) allowed for a quadruple increase in
the consumption of whole grains and a doubling in the
consumption of dark green and orange vegetables and dry
beans (4).
Second, the present LP model applied nutritional constraints
for 9 vitamins, 9 minerals, dietary fiber, and 8 macronutrients
(including added sugars), based on recommendations issued by
authoritative bodies and expert panels (3,24,30­33,39). Com-
pliance with MyPyramid servings was an output variable, as
were energy density and energy cost. Britten et al. (4) first
identified appropriate amounts from each food group and then
cross checked them against amounts of energy, 9 vitamins, 8
minerals, 7 macronutrients, and dietary fiber (3,31). The
amount of "discretionary energy" (equated to SoFAS) was
calculated as the difference between total energy requirements
and the energy that had to be consumed to meet nutrient needs.
The present LP model treated SoFAS embedded in each food as
an output variable while simultaneously taking into consider-
ation all other nutrient needs.
Third, the present model used between 85 and 128 food
groupings instead of 12 (4), making for more granular food
choices. Nutrient composition of food groupings was weighed
by amounts consumed, a procedure also used by others
(15,25,27). The present food categories largely resembled the
96 mutually exclusive food categories, also based on aggregating
unique foods in the 2001­2002 NHANES and previously
published by the National Cancer Institute (40).

There were also similarities between prior studies and the
present results. The present model identified a number of
limiting nutrients, notably calcium and sodium at all energy
levels, and potassium, fiber, and vitamin E at some energy levels
as highlighted by Britten et al. (4) and Wilde et al. (2).
SoFAS are not discrete entities of known energy value.
Rather, SoFAS are embedded in different foods from every food
group (7). To minimize SoFAS, the consumer is steered toward
fat-free milk, low-fat cheeses, extra lean meats or fish, whole
grains, fresh fruit and vegetables (steamed, boiled, baked, or
grilled). However, the similarity between the present results and
previous LP models (2) suggests that the SoFAS allowances may
be too stringent for selected nutrient guidelines to be achieved
(38). For example, Gao (41) showed that, depending on energy
level, compliance with MyPyramid recommendations (including
those on discretionary energy) may be incompatible with
achieving DRI for sodium or vitamin E (2,41).
Some study limitations need to be noted. Dietary intakes
were based on 24-h recall, which precluded the individual long-
term food selections from being taken into account. Hence,
optimized food patterns were developed for population sub-
groups rather than individuals, a procedure also followed by the
USDA (4). Finally, the model was limited to food intakes from
2001­2002 NHANES and the linked food prices. An update
may be required to better address current dietary recommenda-
tions and guidelines.
In conclusion, SoFAS allowances can and should be reduced
from the existing level of 39% to 17­33%, depending on energy
needs. Based on the current dietary recommendations and
respecting American eating habits, the present LP model
created food patterns than met all nutrient guidelines while
permitting much more SoFAS than the MyPyramid diet allows.
According to this LP model, that finding may mean the
nutrition science community should consider making SoFAS
recommendations more permissive, with the proviso that the
present resetting of SoFAS allowances is not an invitation to eat
more. Rather, SoFAS allowances are best spent by making a
broader variety of nutrient dense food choices from every
MyPyramid food group.
