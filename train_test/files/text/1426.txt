Background and Purpose--The few prospective studies that have explored the association between dietary intake of
potassium and risk of stroke have reported inconsistent findings. This study examines the relationship between dietary
potassium intake and the risk of stroke in a representative sample of the US general population.
Methods--Study participants included 9805 US men and women who participated in the first National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Follow-Up Study. Dietary potassium and total energy intake were
estimated at baseline by using a 24-hour dietary recall. Incidence data for stroke and coronary heart disease were
obtained from medical records and death certificates.
Results--Over an average of 19 years of follow up, 927 stroke events and 1847 coronary heart disease events were
documented. Overall, stroke hazard was significantly different among quartiles of potassium intake (likelihood ratio
P0.03); however, a test of linear trend across quartiles did not reach a customary level of statistical significance
(P0.14). Participants consuming a low potassium diet at baseline (34.6 mmol potassium per day) experienced a 28%
higher hazard of stroke (hazard ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.47; P0.001) than other participants, after adjustment for
established cardiovascular disease risk factors.
Conclusions--These findings suggest that low dietary potassium intake is associated with an increased risk of stroke.
However, the possibility that the association is due to residual confounding cannot be entirely ruled out in this
observational study. (Stroke. 2001;32:1473-1480.)

Observational epidemiological studies have identified an
inverse association between dietary intake of potassium
and blood pressure level within and across populations.1 In
addition, randomized controlled trials have documented that
potassium supplementation lowers blood pressure in both
hypertensive and normotensive persons.2 Some studies have
indicated that potassium supplementation to lower blood
pressure may be more effective in persons consuming a low
potassium diet.3 Clinical trials have also shown that a low
dietary potassium intake increases blood pressure.4 Given that
blood pressure level is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular
disease, particularly stroke, dietary potassium intake may be
inversely related to the risk of cardiovascular disease via
blood pressure.
To date, the relationship between dietary potassium and
risk of stroke has been examined in only a few prospective
studies. In a population of 859 male and female retirees in
See Editorial Comment, page 1479
Southern California, Khaw and Barrett-Conner5 identified an
inverse association between potassium intake and stroke mor-
tality. Ascherio et al6 documented an inverse relationship be-
tween the risk of stroke and dietary potassium intake in a cohort
of 43 738 male health professionals. However, data from the
Honolulu Heart Study did not support an inverse association
between dietary potassium intake and the risk of stroke.7 On the
other hand, animal experiments tend to support the independent
role of potassium in reducing the risk of stroke.8
We took advantage of the large sample size, prolonged
follow-up, and national representation of the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiologic
Follow-Up Study (NHEFS) to examine the relationship be-
tween a low dietary potassium intake and the risk of stroke
and coronary heart disease.

Subjects and Methods
Study Population
The first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES I) used a multistage, stratified, probability sampling
design to select a representative sample of the US civilian noninsti-
tutionalized population aged 1 to 74 years.9,10 Certain population
subgroups, including those with a low income, women of childbear-
ing age (25 to 44 years), and elderly persons (aged 65 years) were
oversampled. The NHEFS is a prospective cohort study of NHANES
I participants who were aged 25 to 74 years at their baseline
examinations between 1971 and 1975. Of the 14 407 persons in this
age range at baseline, we excluded 1353 who had a self-reported
history of heart attack, heart failure, or stroke at baseline or had used
medication for heart disease during the 6 months preceding their
baseline examinations, and we also excluded 2849 NHANES I
Augmentation Survey participants for whom the study protocol did
not include the administration of a 24-hour dietary recall. Among the
remaining participants, 400 (3.9%) were lost to follow-up, leaving a
total of 9805 participants who contributed 161 971 person-years of
experience to this analysis.
Measurements
Baseline data collection included a medical history, standardized
medical examination, dietary assessment, laboratory tests, and an-
thropometric measurements.9,10 A single 24-hour dietary recall was
conducted by trained NHANES I personnel with a minimum of a
bachelor's degree in nutrition; a standardized protocol and fifty-one
3D models to estimate portion size were used. The dietary recall
questionnaires were coded by interviewers using nutrient informa-
tion from the US Department of Agriculture Handbook No. 8 or
other resources. Dietary intakes of saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium,
potassium, calcium, vitamin C, vitamin A, and total energy were
calculated for each participant by the National Center for Health
Statistics. Dietary fiber intake was calculated by using food compo-
sition information from ESHA Food Processor software.11 Frozen
sera were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for
measurement of total serum cholesterol levels. Blood pressure, body
weight, and height were obtained by use of standard methods.9 Data
on education, physical activity, and alcohol consumption were
obtained by an interviewer-administered questionnaire.9 The base-
line questionnaire regarding medical history included questions
about selected health conditions and medications used for these
conditions during the preceding 6 months.12 Baseline information on
smoking status was obtained in a subsample of 6913 participants
who underwent a more detailed baseline examination.10 For the
remaining study participants, information on smoking status at
baseline was derived from responses to questions on lifetime
smoking history at follow-up interviews in 1982 to 1984 or later.13­16
The validity of smoking information obtained by using this approach
has been documented.17,18
Follow-Up Procedures
Follow-up data were collected between 1982 and 1984 and in 1986,
1987, and 1992.13­16 Each follow-up examination included tracking
a participant or his/her proxy to a current address, performing
in-depth interviews with the participant or proxy, obtaining hospital
and nursing home records, including pathology reports and ECGs,
and, for decedents, acquiring a death certificate. Incident stroke and
coronary heart disease events were based on documentation of an
event that met prespecified study criteria and occurred during the
period between the participant's baseline examination and last
follow-up interview. The validity of study outcome data from these
sources has been documented.19
Incident stroke was based on a death certificate report in which the
underlying cause of death was recorded by using the International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code of 430­
434.9, 436, or 437.0­437.1 or 1 hospital and/or nursing home stay
in which the participant had a discharge diagnosis with 1 of these
codes. Incident coronary heart disease was based on a death
certificate report in which the underlying cause of death was
recorded by using an ICD-9 code of 410­414 or 1 hospital and/or
nursing home stay in which the participant had a discharge diagnosis
with 1 of these codes. The date of record for incident events was
identified by the date of the first hospital admission with an
established study event or date of death from a study event in the
absence of hospital or nursing home documentation.
Statistical Analysis
Participants were divided into quartile groupings based on their
potassium intake. For each baseline characteristic, the mean or
percentage of study participants was calculated by quartile of
potassium intake. The statistical significance of differences among
quartiles was examined by using the F test from ANOVA (continu-
ous variables) and the 2 test (categorical variables). Trend tests were
conducted by using orthogonal coefficients. The cumulative inci-
dence of coronary heart disease by quartile of potassium intake was
calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method,20 and differences in
cumulative rates were examined by using the log-rank test.21
Because the risk of stroke was similar among the upper 3 quartiles of
potassium intake and significantly higher in the lowest quartile of
potassium intake, the risk of stroke in the lowest quartile was
compared with that in the upper 3 quartiles combined. Cox propor-
tional hazards models were used to explore the relationship between
dietary potassium intake and coronary heart disease risk.22 Age was
used as the time scale for all time-to-event analyses.23 Data from the
participants who had reached 85 years were censored because of
the small number of participants surviving in each quartile at that
age. All Cox proportional hazards models were stratified by birth
cohort, with 10-year intervals used to control for calendar period and
cohort effects. The proportional hazards assumption was verified by
using time-dependent interaction terms.24 Methods to estimate vari-
ances that take into account the sample clustering and stratification
of the NHANES I sample were used in all Cox proportional hazards
models.23
Results
The baseline characteristics of study participants are present-
ed by quartile of dietary potassium intake in Table 1.
Participants in the lower 2 quartiles of potassium intake
tended to be slightly older and were less often white or male
than their counterparts with higher potassium intake. Addi-
tionally, compared with participants with greater dietary
potassium intake, those with a lower potassium intake tended
to have higher mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures, a
higher prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia,
and a higher mean body mass index. Compared with partic-
ipants with higher potassium intake, those with lower intake
were also less physically active and less likely to have
completed high school, to drink regularly, or to smoke. On
average, compared with persons in the lower quartiles of
potassium intake, persons in the upper quartiles of potassium
intake consumed more total energy, saturated fat, cholesterol,
fiber, sodium, calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin C.
During 161 971 person-years of follow up from 1971
through 1992, 927 stroke events and 1847 coronary heart
disease events were documented. Hazard ratios (HRs) and
95% CIs for stroke and coronary heart disease according to
quartile of potassium intake are presented in Table 2. Overall,
stroke hazard was significantly different among quartiles of
potassium intake (likelihood ratio P0.03); however, a test
of linear trend across quartiles did not reach a customary level
of statistical significance (P0.14). Compared with persons
consuming the lowest quartile of potassium intake
(34.6 mmol/d), persons consuming a higher potassium diet

(34.6 mmol/d) experienced a significantly lower hazard of
stroke after adjustment for age, sex, race, and energy intake.
The hazard of stroke for persons with a potassium intake in
the second quartile (34.6 to 49.8 mmol/d) was 24% lower
than that of their counterparts in the lowest quartile (HR 0.76,
95% CI 0.65 to 0.88; P0.001). Similar estimates of relative
hazard were obtained for persons in the third and fourth
quartiles of potassium intake compared with those in the
lowest. When additionally adjusted for systolic blood pres-
sure, serum cholesterol, body mass index, history of diabetes,
physical activity, education level, regular alcohol consump-
tion, current cigarette smoking, vitamin supplement use, and
other dietary factors, the relative hazard estimates for stroke
remained the same. For instance, persons consuming 34.6 to
49.8 mmol/d of potassium experienced a 25% lower stroke
hazard (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88; P0.001) compared
with those in the lowest quartile of intake (consuming
34.6 mmol/d). Again, relative hazard estimates were similar
for the upper 3 quartiles of potassium intake. A linear trend
test was not statistically significant. Given the findings of
significantly lower hazard estimates of very similar magni-
tude at levels of potassium intake above the lowest quartile,
persons with a potassium intake in the lowest quartile
(34.6 mmol/d) were compared with participants having a
potassium intake in the upper 3 quartiles combined
(34.6 mmol/d) in further analyses.
In Kaplan-Meier analyses, the cumulative hazard of stroke
for persons in the lowest quartile of potassium intake com-
pared with all others is presented in the Figure. At age 85,
those in the lowest quartile of potassium intake experienced a
42.2% cumulative hazard of stroke, whereas participants with
a higher intake of potassium experienced a 32.5% cumulative
hazard of stroke (log rank P0.0001). Table 3 presents HRs
and 95% CIs for dietary potassium intake in the lowest
quartile compared with potassium intake in the upper 3
quartiles combined. In age- and energy-adjusted analyses,
persons consuming 34.6 mmol potassium per day experi-
enced a 37% higher hazard of stroke than did persons

consuming more potassium per day (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.20 to
1.54; P0.0001). Additional adjustment for established car-
diovascular disease risk factors and dietary factors produced
only slight attenuation of the relative hazard estimate. For
instance, after adjustment for age, sex, race, systolic blood
pressure, serum cholesterol, body mass index, history of
diabetes, physical activity, education level, regular alcohol
consumption, current cigarette smoking, vitamin supplement
use, and other dietary factors, persons consuming
34.6 mmol potassium per day experienced a 28% higher
hazard of stroke than their counterparts consuming more
potassium (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.47; P0.0001).
Analyses using potassium-to-calorie ratios showed similar
trends; eg, compared with their counterparts in the upper 3
quartiles, persons in the lowest quartile of the potassium-to-
calorie ratio experienced a 16% higher hazard of stroke (HR
1.16, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.37; P0.08), after adjustment for
established cardiovascular disease risk factors and other
dietary factors. The relationship between potassium intake
and coronary heart disease was not statistically significant.
Discussion
The present study documents an independent association
between low dietary potassium intake and increased hazard of
stroke and suggests the possibility of a nonlinear (threshold)
relationship. These findings are consistent with others sug-
gesting that a low potassium intake may increase the risk of
stroke.
Various lines of evidence suggest the possibility of a
nonlinear relationship between dietary potassium intake and
stroke risk. A low dietary potassium intake has been associ-
ated with elevated blood pressure levels. Krishna et al4
conducted a randomized crossover trial of potassium deple-
tion in normotensive men and found that feeding participants
a low potassium diet (10 mmol/d) significantly increased
mean arterial blood pressure (4 mm Hg increase, P0.05).
Later, Krishna and Kapoor25 conducted a second randomized
crossover trial examining dietary potassium depletion (from
96 to 16 mmol/d) in hypertensive subjects. Again they found
significant increases in both systolic (7 mm Hg increase,
P0.01) and diastolic (6 mm Hg increase, P0.04) blood
pressures after feeding the subjects a low potassium diet.
Furthermore, oral potassium supplementation to lower blood
pressure is more effective in populations with a low potas-
sium intake.2 In phase I of the Trials for Hypertension
Prevention (TOHP), potassium supplementation of
60 mmol/d produced no significant reductions in blood
pressure after 6 months.26 The TOHP participants' baseline
intake of potassium (78.3 mmol/d, assessed by dietary recall)
may have been an important reason for the null results
observed. In contrast, randomized trials of potassium supple-
mentation in participants consuming a low potassium diet at
baseline (32 to 35 mmol/d) tend to show large reductions in
blood pressure.3
Our findings of an independent relationship between low
potassium intake and increased hazard of stroke were consis-

tent with those other prospective epidemiological studies,
such as that of Khaw and Barrett-Connor5 and Ascherio et al.6
Khaw and Barrett-Connor found a relative risk of 0.60 (95%
CI 0.44 to 0.82) for stroke mortality associated with a
10 mmol (377 mg) higher potassium intake after adjustment
for age, systolic blood pressure, blood cholesterol level,
obesity, cigarette smoking, fasting blood glucose level, and
estrogen use (in women). Although important, this finding
was based on a small sample (859 persons) with very few
events (24 stroke deaths in 12 years). In contrast, the present
study is based on evidence from 9805 participants who
contributed 161 971 person-years of experience between
1971 and 1992 and among whom there were 927 stroke
events. The study of Ascherio et al found a significant inverse
relationship between dietary potassium intake and the risk of
stroke in men (relative risk for fifth versus first quintile 0.62,
95% CI 0.43 to 0.88; P for trend0.007), after adjustment for
established cardiovascular disease risk factors. When relative
risk estimates were additionally adjusted for dietary intakes
of magnesium and fiber, the association failed to reach
statistical significance (relative risk for extreme quintiles of
potassium intake 0.69, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.07; P for
trend0.11). Their study was conducted among male health
professionals, a highly select group with extensive education,
generally high socioeconomic status, and a greater awareness
of health-related issues than the general population. This
population also had intakes well above the national average
for potassium. A recent study of stroke mortality in the
NHEFS cohort by Fang et al27 revealed an inverse association
between hazard of stroke death and dietary potassium intake
in hypertensive men and black men only. In the present study
of stroke incidence, there was no significant difference in the
relation of dietary potassium intake to hazard of stroke that
was due to ethnicity or hypertensive status. The study by
Fang et al examined stroke mortality only and did not include
adjustment for dietary factors that might confound the rela-
tionship between potassium and stroke risk, such as dietary
intake of fiber, calcium, or vitamin C.
The present study extends the findings of previous pro-
spective studies by examining the effects of potassium intake
on the risk of stroke and of coronary heart disease in a large
representative sample of the noninstitutionalized US popula-
tion with high event rates. Other strengths of the present study
include the assessment of incident stroke and coronary heart
disease over an average of 19 years of follow-up, with
follow-up experience available for 96% of the study par-
ticipants. Moreover, important dietary and nondietary cardio-
vascular disease risk factors were measured at baseline and
controlled in the analysis to reduce the potential impact of
confounding. For example, stroke risk has been inversely
related to dietary intake of fiber, calcium, and vitamin
C,6,28­30 whereas intake of potassium, fiber, calcium, and
vitamin C are highly correlated in dietary studies. An addi-
tional concern is that persons consuming a diet with high
levels of potassium may consume lower levels of saturated fat
and cholesterol, important risk factors for stroke. We adjusted
for all of the above-mentioned nutrients and total energy in a
multivariate model. After this adjustment, the association
between potassium intake and stroke hazard remained
significant.
Data for coronary heart disease in the present study shows
a nonsignificant association with dietary potassium intake.
Experimental evidence, primarily in animals, suggests that
potassium intake may reduce the progression of coronary
artery disease.31 Most prospective cohort studies, except
one,32 did not find significant association between potassium
intake and risk of coronary heart disease. In a study con-
ducted in 11 692 men and women in Scotland, a significant
inverse association between urinary excretion of potassium
and hazard of coronary heart disease was found in men but
not in women. Those data should be interpreted with caution,
because established cardiovascular disease risk factors, such
as smoking, diabetes, and dietary nutrient intake, were not
adjusted in the analysis.32
One limitation of the present study is the estimation of
potassium intake using a single 24-hour dietary recall. Esti-
mates from a single day of intake may not be representative
of the usual long-term intake of the participant and, thus, may
result in misclassification of usual potassium consumption at
the individual level. However, random errors of measurement
in potassium intake would tend to bias any observed associ-
ation toward the null rather than create a spurious association.
Another limitation of the present study is that all outcome
diagnoses were based on hospital and/or nursing home
records or death certificates. Although it was possible to
misdiagnose the subtype of stroke, the clinical diagnosis of
complete stroke should be straightforward. We did not use
stroke subtype in our analysis. Furthermore, there was no
reason to believe that misdiagnosis would differ by baseline
level of potassium intake.
Like all observational epidemiological studies, imperfect
measurement of confounding variables and unmeasured po-

tential confounders may bias the study findings. For instance,
a single measurement of blood pressure was obtained in
NHANES I and used for adjustment, which may not have
reflected long-term blood pressure levels for individuals.
Furthermore, repeated measurements were not available for
dietary potassium intake and potential confounding variables.
Observational studies like ours provide evidence for an
association between low potassium intake and increased risk
of stroke. However, only randomized controlled trials can
define the causality of this association.
The inverse association between potassium and risk of
stroke could result from a combination of factors. First,
potassium supplementation tends to lower blood pressure, a
major risk factor for stroke.1­3 It has been hypothesized that
such reductions in blood pressure may be due to reduced
renal vascular resistance and elevated glomerular filtration
rate, in addition to the natriuresis and diuresis observed with
potassium supplementation.33 One study in African American
hypertensive men indicates that a low dietary potassium
intake (30 mmol/d) may enhance adrenergically mediated
vasoconstriction in response to stress.34 Second, high concen-
trations of potassium may slow the atherosclerotic process
and clot formation by reducing free radical formation, smooth
muscle proliferation, arterial thrombosis, and platelet aggre-
gation.33,35,36 The latter effects have been observed only in
tissue culture or animal experiments, so their relevance to
humans is unknown.
Our findings of an independent relationship between low
potassium intake and increased hazard of stroke in a repre-
sentative sample of the US population have important clinical
and public health implications. Stroke is the third leading
cause of death and the leading basis for long-term disability
in the United States.37 Given its severe health consequences,
the prevention of stroke in the general population is of critical
importance to reduce the public health burden of cardiovas-
cular disease. Further prospective studies are needed to
confirm the association and pattern of dietary potassium
intake and risk of stroke. Depending on the results of such
studies, randomized trials of potassium supplementation to
reduce stroke may be warranted.

Editorial Comment
Potassium, Stroke, and the Bounds of Epidemiological Studies
In the fall of 2000, Tropicana Products received approval
from the US Food and Drug Administration to label orange
juice with the claim, "Diets containing foods that are good
sources of potassium and low in sodium may reduce the risk
of high blood pressure and stroke."1 A logo will appear on
containers reading, "Promotes Cardiovascular Health."2 The
approval was based on a number of epidemiological and
animal studies showing an association between higher intake
of potassium and reduced stroke risk,3 but how strongly do
these studies support a causative role? How strong is the
evidence that increasing potassium intake will reduce the risk
of stroke?
No randomized trial has been completed to show that
increased potassium intake reduces stroke risk, so the direct
association is supported solely by epidemiological studies,
including the preceding article in this issue. In spite of its
large sample and thoughtful implementation, the study illus-
trates the weakness of existing data on potassium and stroke
and demonstrates the limitations of epidemiological, obser-
vational studies in general.
In an epidemiological study, an association does not prove
causation. No matter how careful the study, it is always
possible that the association of interest is due to an imbalance
in underlying risk factors--that it is due to confounding.
Confounding occurs when a factor is associated with the
outcome and is also associated with the treatment. It can
result in the illusion that an effect exists when none is present
or can obscure a true causal effect. A randomized trial of
adequate power is not subject to confounding because ran-
domization assures balance of risk factors in the treatment
groups. Randomization is expected to distribute risk factors
evenly even if a factor is unknown or inaccurately measured.
Epidemiological studies cannot assure such balance.
In the study by Bazzano et al, every measured variable was
significantly associated with the treatment variable, potas-
sium intake, except hypercholesterolemia. Some of these
associations are not surprising given that those consuming
more potassium are likely to consume more altogether,
including total calories, sodium, fiber, and saturated fat.
Some of the factors associated with potassium intake are
known stroke risk factors, such as diabetes, cigarette smok-
ing, and low levels of physical activity, which makes them
potential confounders. A simple univariate analysis of potas-
sium and stroke risk ignores these associations, so that
potassium becomes a marker for all the other factors that are
associated with it. For example, an inverse association be-
tween potassium intake and stroke risk in a univariate
analysis could represent higher levels of physical activity in
those consuming more potassium (and more calories all
together). In this instance, physical activity could be respon-
sible for reduced stroke risk; then, potassium supplementation
would have no effect.
Bazzano et al use multivariate modeling, a standard ap-
proach in epidemiological studies. By incorporating all
known and identified risk factors into the model, the re-
searcher attempts to adjust for existing imbalances. If every
important risk factor for the outcome of interest is accurately
measured and its form is correctly specified, multivariate
models will lead to valid estimates of the treatment effect.
However, multivariate models may produce biased results if
confounding factors are not measured accurately. For exam-
ple, those with low recreational activity have been identified,
and a variable reflecting this can be entered into the multi-
variate model. Then, the association between potassium
intake and stroke is said to be independent of recreational
physical activity; this factor is said to be controlled. However,
if this factor is inaccurately measured, control will be incom-
plete. If the definition of low recreational physical activity is
too coarse, those who jog 5 miles each day may be placed in
the same group as those who stroll around the block after
dinner. Potassium intake could be a more accurate measure of
physical activity, given its association with total energy
intake, and its association with stroke risk could be through
the more vigorous activity of those who take in more
potassium. Then, the multivariable result could suggest that
potassium intake is inversely associated with stroke risk after
controlling for low recreational activity, but the association
could still be due to physical activity. Including a potential

confounder in a multivariate model does not ensure that it is
controlled if it is measured inaccurately or imprecisely.
Other confounding factors may not be measured, further
weakening epidemiological studies. For example, those with
greater potassium intake probably have healthier diets in
general and may be more highly motivated to maintain
health; they may be more adherent with medications, for
example. Then, an inverse association between potassium
intake and stroke risk could be due to differences in medica-
tion adherence. Such an association may be responsible for
the apparent protective effect of hormone replacement ther-
apy in results from epidemiological studies of cardiovascular
disease risk, since recent randomized trials have shown a
detrimental effect.4 Those who take hormone replacement
therapy may have more healthy lifestyles in ways that have
not been fully measured. Because the foods that contain large
amounts of potassium, such as fruits and vegetables, are
generally considered healthful, a similar association between
potassium intake and healthy lifestyle could account for an
association. If this is the case, potassium supplementation
would not be beneficial.
Epidemiological studies are often more efficient than
randomized trials, and because of this often have larger
sample sizes, which can yield misleading results. In a
randomized trial, a larger sample size increases the likelihood
that a true causal effect will be demonstrated, if present,
because a smaller treatment effect can reach statistical sig-
nificance. Further, a larger sample size increases the likeli-
hood that other confounding factors will be relatively bal-
anced. However, in an epidemiological study, larger sample
size increases the likelihood that a significant association is
due to bias: a smaller treatment effect will reach statistical
significance, but imbalances in confounding factors will not
be reduced. For example, the 28% higher risk of stroke with
P0.001 in the large study by Bazzano et al is more likely to
be due to confounding than a hypothetical 100% higher risk
with P0.01 in a smaller study. The larger sample size
tempts one to attribute small associations to causal effects,
but this may be the influence of confounders.
Epidemiological studies may also be weakened by post hoc
definition of primary outcomes. Randomized trials commit to
a single primary hypothesis, and epidemiological studies have
not been held to the same standard. A 6 is more likely to show
up in a game with more throws of the die. Similarly, changing
the cut point for comparisons can increase the likelihood of
finding a significant effect. For example, if a dose-response
association between potassium intake and stroke risk, as seen
in other epidemiological studies,5 is hypothesized a priori,
then the test for trend in the multivariate model would be the
primary test, which did not reach statistical significance in
this study (P0.14). Other studies of potassium and stroke
have compared the highest to the lowest groups,6 which also
did not reach statistical significance (confidence intervals of
the relative risk include 1.0). Rather, the authors compared
the lowest quartile to the other 3 (P0.001). The prespecified
comparison of stroke hazard among quartiles of potassium
intake is a more realistic representation of the strength of the
association (P0.03). Regardless of how rational the com-
parisons seem in retrospect, unless a primary outcome mea-
sure has been selected a priori, the likelihood of finding a
significant underlying association must be suspect--the prob-
ability value overestimates the true statistical significance.
In spite of the limitations of this careful study, the results
provide additional support for a possible independent associ-
ation between potassium intake and stroke risk. Also, prior
randomized trials have shown a significant association be-
tween potassium supplementation and lower blood pressure
in some groups,7 so a biological link to stroke risk is
plausible. Although the limitations of epidemiological studies
are important, such studies are essential to clinical research
because randomized trials are expensive, slow to deliver
results, often impractical, and occasionally unethical. How-
ever, when epidemiological studies find small treatment
effects and confounding influences--measured and unmea-
sured--are likely, randomized trials are clearly indicated.
Until a randomized trial is performed, the major indication for
orange juice may be tastiness rather than reduction in stroke
risk.
