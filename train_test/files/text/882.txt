Demographic and geographic variability of kidney stones in the United
States. To characterize demographic and regional variation in kidney
stone prevalence in the U.S., we studied two nationwide cross-sectional
surveys that included data on self-reported, physician-diagnosed kidney
stones, supplementing published data on hospitalizations for stones. The
larger study, Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS II), included 1,185,124 men
and women, age 30, recruited nationally in 1982, and provides state-
specific prevalence estimates. The National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES II) was a national probability sample of 25,286
U.S. adults interviewed between 1976 and 1980. Kidney stone prevalence
increased with age until age 70, then declined and was higher in men than
women and in whites than blacks. Prevalence among Hispanic and Asian
men was intermediate between that of whites and blacks. There was a
strong, statistically significant regional variability in stone prevalence
among U.S. whites. The age-adjusted prevalence increased from north to
south, and from west to east. The contrast in state-specific prevalence was
greatest between men in North Carolina (prevalence = 14.9; 95%
confidence interval = 14.2 to 15.7) and North Dakota (5.6; 4.7 to 6.4), and
between women in South Carolina (6.4; 5.8 to 6.9) and South Dakota (2.4;
1.9 to 2.9). The marked variations in kidney stone prevalence by age,
gender, race, and geographic location may provide clues to their etiology
and prevention.
Demographic and regional variations in the occurrence of
kidney stones may provide clues to their etiology and prevention.
Kidney stones occur most commonly in middle-aged men [1] and
whites are more affected than are blacks [2] and Asians [3].
Evidence that stones vary geographically in the U.S. comes
primarily from hospital discharge surveys [4, 5]. The highest rates
of hospitalization are in the Southeast and the lowest are in the
Northwest. Additionally, a hospital-based prevalence study in
North Carolina [6] and a study of occupational populations in
Tennessee [7] found higher lifetime risks of stones in these
Southeastern states compared with a population-based study in
Minnesota [1] and a survey of well members of an HMO in
Northern California [31.
Our purpose was to examine rates of self-reported kidney
stones, measured as lifetime prevalence, in two large cross-
sectional surveys of U.S. adults from 1976 to 1980 and in 1982.
These data provide a more complete picture of the demographic

and geographic variability of kidney stones in the U.S. than
previously reported.
Methods
Study populations
In the fall of 1982, 1,185,124 men and women participated in
the second Cancer Prevention Survey (CPS II), described else-
where [8]. Briefly, over 77,000 American Cancer Society volun-
teers enrolled friends, neighbors or relatives living in households
with at least one member 45 years of age or older. In eligible
households, all members 30 years old or greater were asked to
complete a self-administered questionnaire on disease history,
medication use, dietary habits, occupational exposures and other
health-related matters. Participants were enrolled in all fifty
states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
The second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES II) was conducted between 1976 and 1980 with a
national probability sample of 25,286 noninstitutionalized, civilian
men and women. The survey utilized a stratified, multistage
sampling scheme to select participants between the ages of 6
months and 74 years who were examined and interviewed at 64
sites in the U.S., including Hawaii.
Data collection
Participants in CPS II provided their age at enrollment and
specified their race or ethnicity as either white, black, Hispanic,
Asian, or other. Kidney stones were listed on the CPS II ques-
tionnaire as one of 24 diseases or conditions which had ever been
diagnosed by a physician. A subject who checked "kidney stones"
was considered to have had one or more stones based on
self-report. We excluded 548 participants with missing informa-
tion on stones, seven participants under age 30 at enrollment, and
9,708 persons for whom race was unknown. Complete information
regarding age, gender, race and history of stones was obtained on
504,380 men and 670,481 women who form the study population.
These subjects represent 99.1% of men and women completing
questionnaires.
In NHANES II, age was recorded as of the date of interview
and race was classified by the interviewer as white, black or other.
Participants in NHANES II were asked "Have you ever had
kidney stones?" and were considered to have had at least one
stone based on a yes response. Because of the small number of
nonwhite participants in NHANES II, and since CPS II was

Analysis
In CPS II, the lifetime prevalence of stones for a particular age,
race, or sex subgroup was estimated from the proportion report-
ing a history of ever having been diagnosed with kidney stones by
a physician. Age-, race- and sex-specific prevalence was calculated
for the entire study population.
We calculated prevalence for white participants by state, five
categories of latitude, and seven geographic regions (see Appen-
dix). We were unable to perform similar calculations for minority
participants because of insufficient numbers. Latitudes were se-
lected to generally follow state northern and southern boundaries.
Prevalence estimates were directly standardized to the age distri-
bution (5-year age groups) of the entire CPS II cohort. Ninety-five
percent confidence intervals (CI) for prevalence estimates were
calculated assuming that the responses to the survey were distrib-
uted binomially [9].
The prevalence ratio (PR), a measure comparing the preva-
lence of stones in one group of CPS II participants with that in a
reference group (for example, the prevalence in Asians compared
to the prevalence in whites), was used to assess differences in the
occurrence of stones among demographic and geographic groups
[101. Further, in examining associations with race, we controlled
for geographic region using a logistic regression model that
included race, age (5-year intervals), and region. We tested the
statistical significance of a North-South trend in prevalence using
a five-level ordinal variable for latitude in a logistic regression
model that also included age and race. A West-East trend in
prevalence was evaluated in a similar manner using a four-level
ordinal variable for the northern regions (Northwest, North
Central, Midwest, Northeast) and, in a separate analysis, a
three-level variable for the southern regions (Southwest, South
Central, Southeast). All regression models had history of kidney
stones (yes or no) as the outcome. Data were analyzed using SAS
software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).
To determine how closely the prevalence estimates from the
CPS II volunteer sample compare with estimates from a repre-
sentative U.S. probability sample, we calculated age-, and sex-
specific lifetime prevalence of stones for white participants in
NHANES II and compared these measures with those of CPS II.
NHANES II data were analyzed using SUDAAN software (Re-
search Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Caro-
lina, USA) so that sample weights and other elements of the
complex survey design could be considered in estimates of stone
prevalence. Confidence intervals were calculated using the stan-
dard error of the prevalence estimates. In comparisons with CPS
II, an age- and sex-specific prevalence estimate from NHANES II
whose 95% confidence interval did not include the corresponding
CPS II prevalence estimate was considered to be significantly
different at the 5% error level.
Results
Participants in CPS II were largely middle-aged and white
(Table 1). Stone prevalence increased with age until age 70 and
then declined in nearly all race-sex groups. Overall, among
subjects in CPS II, stones were more common in men than women
(PR = 2.64; CI = 2.60 to 2.68). Among men, the prevalence of
stones among blacks was less than half that among whites, while
prevalences among Hispanics and Asians were 30% and 37%
lower than in whites, respectively. Among women, prevalence was
lowest in Asians (nearly one-half the white rate), while rates were
12% and 35% less in Hispanics and blacks than in whites,
respectively. These relationships changed very little after adjust-
ment for age and region. Compared to whites, the adjusted odds
of stones for men and women, respectively, were: blacks, 0.40,
0.61; Hispanics, 0.66, 0.85; and Asians, 0,56, 0.54.
The prevalence of kidney stones among the white participants
of NHANES II tended to be lower among men and higher among
women than those in CPS H (Table 1). Prevalence estimates were
significantly lower in 65 to 69 and 70 to 74 year old men in
NHANES II and significantly higher in 50 to 54 year old women
in NHANES II compared to CPS II (Fig. 1). The pattern of an

increasing prevalence with age, until approximately age 70 when
there was a slight decline, was observed in both CPS II and
NHANES II.
Among white men and women in CPS II, stone prevalence
increased with more southern latitude (Table 2). Men living in the
southernmost latitude were 60% more likely to report a history of
stones than those living in the most northern latitude (PR = 1.60;
CI = 1.49 to 1.72). Women living in the most southern section
were 45% more likely to report stones than women in the most
northern section (PR 1.45; CI = 1.31 to 1.61). Trend tests
applied to these data found the apparent north-south gradient in
stone prevalence highly statistically significant both for men and
women, adjusted for age and race (P < 0.0001).
The prevalence of kidney stones also increased from western
regions to those in the east for both men and women in CPS II
(Table 2). This trend was statistically significant for regions in the
northern half of the country (Northwest, North Central, Midwest,
Northeast) as well as for those in the south (Southwest, South
Central, Southeast), adjusted for age and race (P < 0.0001).
The state-specific prevalence estimates of stones among white
males, classified into six intervals, are displayed in Figure 2.
Stones were the least common among men living in the northern-
most states and most common among those residing in North
Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Prevalence in men ranged
from 5.6 (CI = 4.7 to 6.4) in North Dakota to 14.9 (CI = 14.2 to
15.7) in North Carolina (Appendix). Stones were also very com-
mon among men living in Puerto Rico.
While the prevalence of stones was lower among women than
men in every state, the distribution by state was similar in men and
women (Fig. 3). Prevalence among white women ranged from 2,4
(CI = 1.9 to 2.9) in South Dakota to 6.4 (CI =5.8 to 6.9) in South
Carolina (Appendix).
Finally, residents in the Southeast were nearly twice as likely to
have been diagnosed with stones as those living in the Northwest
[PR = 1.79 (CI 1,69 to 1.89), men; PR = 1.84 (CI = 1.69 to
2.00), womenl.
Discussion
Our principle finding is that the lifetime prevalence of kidney
stones varied substantially by geographic region in the U.S.,
increasing from north to south and from west to east. Our results
extend the findings of hospital discharge surveys [4, 5} which,
presumably because of sparse data resulting from low survey
response rates (less than 30%), failed to find statistically signifi-
cant results despite large apparent differences between the South-
east and the Northwest in hospitalization rates for stones. The
highest prevalence of kidney stones in CPS II was seen in six
Southeastern states: North and South Carolina, Georgia, Ala-
bama, Mississippi, and Tennessee.
Many factors have been hypothesized to cause kidney stones.
Of these, only climate can be reasonably assessed through crude
geographic correlations. In 1945, a high incidence of stones was
observed among troops stationed in desert war regions [11]. The
stones presented soon after transfer to the area and the incidence
was higher among those transferred during summer months.

Subsequently, numerous reports from around the world of in-
creased stone rates during warmer months were published [12--
17]. A high incidence of stones was also observed among Euro-
pean immigrants to Israel [18] and among members of the Royal
Navy serving in Mediterranean and tropical zones [19].
Climatologic factors most likely responsible for these findings
are heat, associated with a more concentrated urine; and sunlight,
known to increase vitamin D production. Experimental evidence
for heat and dehydration comes from a study of immigrants to two
towns in Israel [20]. During a three year period, the prevalence of
stones among the immigrants to one of the towns, who had been
conditioned to increase their fluid intake, was only one-tenth that
among immigrants to the otherwise similar town. The possible
role of sunlight in stone occurrence was suggested by Parry and
Lister [21], who measured urinary constituents of soldiers before
and 10 days after transfer to a tropical climate, and found that
urine calcium levels increased markedly only among soldiers
transferred during summer months. The authors, having consid-
ered other factors such as changes in diet, differences in water
hardness, and fluid intake, concluded that the hypercalciuria
resulted from sunlight exposure. Sunlight stimulates increased
production of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol in the skin which, after
conversion to 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D by the kidneys, enhances
the intestinal absorption of calcium. Subsequent studies found
elevated levels of circulating vitamin D in patients with hypercal-
ciuria [22] as well as positive correlations between serum vitamin
D levels and both urinary calcium and urinary oxalate excretion
[23]. We reasoned that persons living in more southern locations
in the U.S. would have greater potential exposure to both high
ambient temperature and sunlight. The consistent north-south
gradient in lifetime prevalence of stones among both men and
women in CPS II provides ecologic evidence that hot weather
and/or sunlight may exacerbate stone occurrence.
The apparent gradient of higher risk in Eastern states (Table 2),
seen especially in men, was expected in the Southeastern "stone
belt" states but not in the Northeast. This east-west gradient,
although not as pronounced in the North as in the South, suggests
that factors other than climate may play an important role in the
development of stones: possibly diet [24], drinking water [25],
and/or comorbid conditions such as hypertension [26] and obesity
[271. For example, oxalate-rich foods such as collards and greens
and tea, are more popular in the Southeast than elsewhere.

Shuster et a! [25] provide evidence that drinking water is softer
(contains less calcium and other minerals) in eastern states
compared to those in the west. A complete examination of these
hypotheses is beyond the scope of the present paper.
The large size and geographic diversity of CPS II provides a
unique opportunity to study the prevalence of stone disease by
state. Because we measured the prevalence of physician-diag-
nosed stones rather than hospitalizations for treatment of stones,
the study avoids potential biases from regional variations in
medical treatment that limit previous national surveys [4, 5].
We cannot envision biases that might artificially create the
geographic variation observed in this study. It is possible that
physicians in the South might be more aware of stones and thus be
more likely to diagnose them than are physicians elsewhere. Most
kidney stones are symptomatic [28], however, and the symptoms
of renal colic are distinctive, arguing against this alternative
explanation. Further, the observed smooth gradient in prevalence
from north to south is unlikely due to regional differences in
diagnosis.
The number of subjects who participated in CPS II in two states
was quite small and may have resulted in inaccurate estimates of
state-specific stone prevalence for those states. Volunteers in
Oklahoma and Alaska enlisted only 130 and 854 participants,
respectively. In each remaining state, on the other hand, at least
1,000 persons were enrolled and in 70% of states more than
10,000 residents participated.
The lower prevalence of stones that we observed among
subjects in the oldest age groups of men and women in CPS II and
NHANES II was unexpected. This may reflect less complete
detection in past decades, lower use of physicians, or incomplete
recall. It might also reflect higher rates of mortality among stone
formers perhaps due to differences in diet, lifestyle, or comorbid-
ity. However, none of the medical conditions known to be
associated with stones seem sufficiently common or lethal to
account for the decrease we observed. It is also possible that the
lower prevalence among the oldest subjects reflects a birth cohort
effect, since the incidence of stones appears to be increasing over
the last century in the U.S. [1, 5], Sweden [29, 30], and other
countries [31]. Increasing incidence would be manifest as a
greater frequency of stone occurrence among young compared to
older persons.
It has been previously noted that stones are more common
among whites than blacks. Sarmina, Spirnak and Resnick [2], in a
comprehensive review and hospital-based study of stone occur-
rence among blacks, concluded that stones were about three to
four times more common among whites than blacks. Our finding
that lifetime prevalence among whites was twice that among
blacks is identical to that found by Hiatt et al [3]. Hiatt et a! [3],
in the single published study of stones among Asian Americans,
also reported that stone prevalence among Asians living in
Northern California ranged from 1.0 to 5.2 percent among men
and from 1.2 to 1.0 percent among women in the third to the
seventh decade of age, respectively. Stone prevalence among
Asian participants in CPS II was slightly higher than that reported
by Hiatt et al. However, our data are consistent with their finding
in California that Asian women had the lowest prevalence of
stones and that the prevalence among Asian men was intermedi-
ate between that of white and black men.
To our knowledge, the prevalence of stones among Hispanics
has not been previously described. Among participants of CPS II,
Hispanic men and, to a lesser degree, Hispanic women were less
likely to report a stone diagnosis than were whites. The difference
between Hispanic men and women relative to whites suggests that
the prevalence of stones among Hispanics may be influenced by
the white and black racial heterogeneity of the Hispanic popula-
tion. The CPS II questionnaire did not ask subjects to indicate
both race and ethnicity and fewer than 10% of Hispanics did so.
More than thirty years ago, researchers noted the relative rarity
of kidney stones among blacks compared to whites and Indians
living in Africa, and proposed a number of possible causes which
have yet to be tested [32]. Rather than genetic differences, these
investigators favored environmental (especially dietary) causes
including: (1) less intake and absorption of calcium among blacks,
resulting in lower serum and urinary calcium levels [32, 33]; (2)
higher carbohydrate consumption among blacks leading to a
higher average urinary output [34] and a higher acid-ash residue
[35]; and (3) nutritional liver damage among blacks which, by
failing to metabolize circulating estrogens, resulted in increased
urinary citrate excretion [36]. More recent African studies attrib-
uted lower stone rates in blacks to higher urinary sodium-to-
calcium ratios [37] or to low calcium content in drinking water and
limited consumption of dairy products [38]. Recent evidence for
an apparent protective effect of calcium intake [24] would seem to
refute some of these hypothesized mechanisms.
Compared to whites, black CPS II participants were somewhat
more likely to live in the Southeast, Hispanics in the Southwest
and South Central, and Asians in the Southwest. However, in
analyses comparing stone prevalence in minorities to that in
whites, the odds ratios adjusted for region were the same as the
unadjusted prevalence ratios. This indicates that the prevalence
estimates themselves were not confounded by region.
Studies which rely on voluntary enrollment may be biased by
selective participation. Since CPS II was primarily a cancer study,
it is unlikely that participation would be influenced by kidney
stones. The comparison with the NHANES II probability sample
revealed remarkably similar prevalence estimates by age and by
gender among whites. This finding addresses two main concerns:
first, whether persons with stones are less likely to participate in
voluntary surveys; and second, how well a volunteer sample can
represent the U.S. We believe that the validity of the contrasts
between age, gender, and regional subgroups of CPS II partici-
pants, while not dependent upon representativeness, is strength-
ened by the results of this comparison.
In summary, we found that the lifetime prevalence of kidney
stones varied markedly among a large cohort of U.S. residents
according to age, race, gender, and geographic location. Our
results supplement previously reported findings from hospital
surveys with low participation rates. These demographic and
geographic differences most likely reflect environmental, poten-
tially preventable, causes. Further study of specific risk factors in
CPS H are underway.
