Abstract. Physical inversion of whole or partial human body representations typically has catastrophic
consequences on the observer's ability to perform visual processing tasks. Explanations usually focus
on the effects of inversion on the visual system's ability to exploit configural or structural relationships,
but more recently have also implicated motion or kinematic cue processing. Here, we systematically
tested the role of both on perceptions of sex from upright and inverted point-light walkers. Our
data suggest that inversion results in systematic degradations of the processing of kinematic cues.
Specifically and intriguingly, they reveal sex-based kinematic differences: Kinematics characteristic
of females generally are resistant to inversion effects, while those of males drive systematic sex
misperceptions. Implications of the findings are discussed.
Keywords: biological motion, sex perception, inversion, point-light walkers, structural processing, kinematic processing.
1 Introduction
"Mister Squiggle"--the marionette namesake of a long-running Australian children's show who hap-
pened to have a pencil for a nose--had a singular and delightful skill. It was to use his nose to draw
images that were upside down. Only when his hapless human sidekick reoriented the image would its
subject matter become clear: A car or tree or a human's face would emerge from what just moments
before had seemed a meaningless graphic jumble http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwNrG9a22nc.
In the field of human perception, this phenomenon is rather more formally known as the Inversion
Effect. It manifests in a range of situations such that physical orientation of an image determines its
interpretability: Images that easily are interpreted when presented right side up are rendered meaningless
when presented upside down. In the case of the Thatcher Illusion (Thompson, 1980), for example, only
when a previously inverted image is presented right side up does it become clear the well-known face
actually has incorporated into it gross structural anomalies (see, for example, Bartlett & Searcy, 1993).
Whole body representations are similarly prone to the effects of physical inversion. Point-light
walkers--usually a high-value stimulus from which observers can almost instantly interpret complex
and detailed information (Johansson, 1973)--become a far less reliable source of information when
presented upside down (Ikeda, Blake, & Watanabe, 2005; Pavlova & Sokolov, 2000; Proffitt &
Bertenthal, 1990; Sumi, 1984). Moreover, the consequences to interpretability of physical inversion
seem to be generalized: They manifest across a range of tasks including detection of figures in visual
noise (Bertenthal & Pinto, 1994; Pavlova & Sokolov, 2000; Troje, 2003), direction discrimination
(Bertenthal & Pinto, 1994), action recognition (Dittrich, 1993; Shipley, 2003), and sex discrimination
(Barclay, Cutting, & Kozlowski, 1978).

Accounts of the mechanisms underlying these effects usually focus on the consequences of physi-
cal inversion for configural or structural processing (Bertenthal & Pinto, 1994; Dittrich, 1993; Proffitt
& Bertenthal, 1990; Reed, Stone, Bozova, & Tanaka, 2003; Shiffrar, Lichtey, & Chatterjee, 1997).
In the case of both faces and point-light walkers, the consensus view has been that mechanisms spe-
cialized for those respective types of body representations are so highly tuned to the "normal" or
right-side-up structure that disruptions imposed by physical inversion undermine the entire stimulus
processing sequence (Freire, Lee, & Symons, 2000; Leder & Bruce, 2000; Maurer, Le Grand, &
Mondloch, 2002; Proffitt & Bertenthal, 1990; Reed et al., 2003).
More recently, however, evidence has emerged suggesting the story may be more complex. Troje
and Westhoff (2006) argue that, in the case of biological motion perceptions at least, the explanatory
power of the so-called "shape inversion effect" is insufficient. They posit an alternative account in
which motion or kinematic processing also plays a role. According to their model, there is an hier-
archy of contributions to the inversion effect such that disruption of structural processing plays a
secondary role to disruption of kinematic processing. That is, while the processing of structural cues
remains relatively uncompromised when point-light figures are presented upside down, the processing
of kinematic cues is strongly compromised (Troje & Westhoff, 2006).
Interestingly, Johnson and Tassinary (2005) independently propose a model for the perception of
sex cues that is consistent with Troje and Westhoff's (2006) account of inversion effects. Like Troje
and Westhoff, Johnson and Tassinary propose a structure/kinematic processing hierarchy, but one that
mediates not biological motion perceptions generally but sex discriminations specifically. In particular,
Johnson and Tassinary propose that, when discriminating the sex of an individual, structural cues are the
primary and direct driver of sex perceptions and that kinematic cues are secondary, or indirect indicators.
In the context of inversion effects, Johnson and Tassinary's model is consistent with Troje and West-
hoff's: It predicts that under inversion conditions, perceptions arising from the processing of structural
cues should be more robust to inversion than perceptions driven by the processing of kinematic cues.
There is some evidence to support those two models, but it is controversial. Barclay et al. (1978)
first reported that inversion of point-light walkers leads to systematic misperceptions of the sex of the
walkers such that inverted females look male, and inverted males look female. Mather and Murdoch
(1994), investigating the mechanisms that give rise to perceived sex, proposed that kinematic cues
(rather than structural cues) mediate sex perceptions. They argued that the inversion effects reported
by Barclay et al. may have been mediated by confusions driven by the relative velocities of hip and
shoulder markers in Barclay's original point-light displays. While the idea that kinematic rather than
structural cues drive sex perceptions contradicts the model proposed by Johnson and Tassinary (2005),
Mather and Murdoch's account of the effect is consistent with the idea that inversion disrupts the pro-
cessing of kinematic rather than structural information.
With that in mind, the general aim of the experiments described here was to investigate the impact
of inversion on biological motion processing. More specifically, the experiments reported here inves-
tigated the impact of inversion on sex discriminations made on the basis of structural and kinematic
cues. Experiment 1 shows that sex discriminations made on the basis of structural cues alone are unaf-
fected by inversion. Sex discriminations made on the basis of kinematic cues are disrupted by inver-
sion, but only for male point-light walkers. Experiment 2 shows those effects persist when kinematic
sex cues are paired with coherent structural sex cues. Together, these experiments confirm a sex cues
processing hierarchy that is consistent with the models of biological motion processing proposed by
both Troje and Westhoff (2006) and Johnson and Tassinary (2005). In that hierarchy, structural cues to
sex are more resilient to orientation changes than are kinematic cues.
2 Methods
2.1
Participants
Participants comprised seven males and seven females (age-range: 21­56 years). All had normal or
corrected-to-normal vision. Prior to testing, each participant received an information sheet explaining
the experimental task and informed written consent was obtained. Experiments were conducted in
accordance with the Helsinki Declaration (2008).
2.2
Design
A repeated-measures design was used in both experiments. Using a two-alternative forced-choice
(2AFC) paradigm, participants discriminated each of a series of point-light walkers (presented in ran-
Role of kinematics in biological motion inversion effects 122
domized order) as "male" or "female." The independent variables were strength of sex cues (structure
model/kinematic model--see below) and point-light orientation (upright vs inverted). The dependent
variable was proportion of "male" responses for each type of stimulus (model combination 1 orientation)
shown. Analyses of the data were conducted by using the PSY statistical program (Professor Kevin
Bird, University of NSW, Kensington NSW, Australia).
2.3
Apparatus
Stimuli were presented on a 19" monitor positioned 37 cm from each participant such that 1 cm
subtended 1° of visual angle. Participants indicated their responses using a standard QWERTY key-
board (M and Z keys signalling female or male counterbalanced across participants). PointLightLab
(Version 4.5.10), a custom-developed program, was used to generate point-light walker stimuli.
2.4
Stimuli
The point-light walker stimuli used for these experiments were adapted from 13 models constructed
by Nikolaus Troje (2002, 2008). Those models were constructed from actual walkers (50 females,
50 males) using the techniques described elsewhere (Troje, 2008). The 13 models provided describe a
gender continuum that steps from an extreme female model (continuum value 26) in single standard
deviation units to an extreme male model (continuum value 16). The model at 0 on the continuum
represents the average from all the walkers.
Each of Troje's original models is composed of two sets of information. There are structural
coordinates defining the starting locations of each of the 15 point-lights (structure cues) from which
each walker is composed--see Figure 1. Those coordinates vary the locations of the point-lights as a
function of the strength of the sex cues: The positions of the 15 points, with respect to each other, is
different for each model on the original continuum. Paired with each of those points is also kinematic
information that describes changes in location of each joint coordinate over time for each particular
model. That path information is such that each joint travels a predictable track that returns to its origi-
nal starting position each complete (two steps) walking cycle. In that way, in the original continuum,
each of the 13 models varies simultaneously in both structural and kinematic cues to sex.
For the stimuli used here, we separated, for each point-light at each point along the continuum,
the structural and kinematic cues and then recombined those separate cues in unique ways to create
new walkers that vary in the strength of sex cues carried by structure, by kinematics, or by both. For
example, the starting positions of the 15 point-lights used to describe the structure of the objectively
sex-neutral walker (structural cues, model 0) can be paired with the kinematic (path) information from
that same model in the standard configuration. Here, we describe that model in terms of its structure/
kinematic components as 0/0. Similarly, it is possible to pair the sex-neutral model structural cues with
the kinematic cues from the 25 female walker for a unique model described here as 0/25. In those
two examples, the structural information about the sex of the walker has been held constant while the
kinematic cues to sex have changed. It is similarly possible to combine the -5 model structure with the
0 model kinematics (25/0) and the 15 model structure with the 0 model kinematics (15/0) for two
walkers that vary in the strength of their structural sex cues but which simultaneously are equal in terms
of their kinematic cues to sex. Those pairing manipulations for each experiment are detailed below.
Stimuli were in sagittal view and each walker subtended an average visual angle of 16.7° in height
and 6.8° in width. All 15 points of light were depicted as white dots, each with a luminance level of 160
cd/m² and were presented on a gray background of 12.5 cd/m². The Michelson contrast [(Lmax 2Lmin)/
(Lmax 1 Lmin)] between the luminance level of the white points of light and background was 0.42.
2.5
Procedure
Participants were seated in a light and sound-attenuated room. Instructions were presented both orally
and in written form on the computer screen before testing commenced. Participants were asked to
respond as quickly and accurately as possible. Testing was completed in a single session. All par-
ticipants completed an initial practice block comprising 10 trials for the purpose of task familiariza-
tion. During and after practice, participants were encouraged to ask questions of the observer. Stimuli
were presented in blocks (see below) with block orders randomized between participants. Within each
block, stimuli were presented in randomized orders within and across participants. Presentation dura-
tion for each stimulus was 1000 ms, which equates in this case to one point-light walker step. The
interstimulus interval was 1000 ms. Participants indicated for each stimulus observed whether they
believed the walker to be "male" or "female."

3 Experiment 1
As already noted, Troje and Westhoff's (2006) account of the inversion effect, which marries with
the sex processing model of Johnson and Tassinary (2005), is that perceptual impairments are driven
primarily by the impacts of inversion on kinematic, not structural, processing. While they note in their
paper that inversion effects manifest with respect to multiple perceptual tasks, the paradigm via which
they provide empirical support for their model focuses specifically on a direction discrimination task.
The question arises whether the impact of inversion on kinematic processing will be observed in
relation to other discrimination tasks.
Experiment 1 was designed specifically to address that question by asking observers to judge the
sex of upright and inverted walkers. As already noted, Barclay et al. (1978) have previously demon-
strated sex discriminations are subject to an inversion effect, but here the mechanism giving rise to
those effects is unpacked. Specifically, the impact of inversion on structural and kinematic sex-cue
processing was separately probed using two novel point-light continua. In the first, sex was differ-
entiated only by structural cues. Kinematic cues did not distinguish between walkers. In the second
continuum, the opposite was true: Kinematic cues were the only reliable cues to sex because structural
cues were constant. It was predicted that inversion of the point-light models would affect sex percep-
tions based on kinematic cues, but not sex perceptions based on structural cues.
Figure 1. Stimuli were created using structural and kinematic (path) information derived from models of point-
light walkers provided by Troje (2008). A. Each walker is composed of a set of point-lights at specific starting
coordinates (top figure) and then motion is imposed along a specific kinematic path (bottom figure). B. Those two
pieces of information can be separated to control for, in this example, structure while varying path. In both figures,
the structural information is consistent with a 0 model walker from Troje's original continuum. The top figure is
the 0 structural model paired with the 25 (female) model motion path. The bottom figure is the 0 structural model
paired with the 15 (male) model motion path. C. In these figures, motion is held constant while structure is varied.
The top figure is the 25 structure paired with the 0 model motion path. The bottom figure is the 15 structure
paired with the 0 model motion path. Inversion can be achieved by rotation of these figures through 180°.
Role of kinematics in biological motion inversion effects 124
3.1
Methods
Two different sets of 13 walkers were used here. In the first set, structural information varied: The
coordinates for each of the original 13 point-light walker models were paired, in every case, with
kinematic information from the sex-neutral (0) walker model (structure varies, kinematics constant).
In the second set of walkers, structural cues to sex were held constant while kinematic cues varied:
The structural coordinates for the 0 walker were paired with the 13 different sets of path information
from each of the original 13 models (structure constant, kinematics vary). For each of the models thus
produced, both upright and inverted exemplars were created. Two blocks of stimuli were presented
such that the effects of structural and kinematic information could be tested separately. Each block
comprised 260 trials with order randomized (13 exemplars  2 orientations  10 repeats).
3.2
Results
For each model tested, at each orientation, the mean proportion of "male" responses was calculated
across participants. Those data are illustrated in Figure 2. As that figure shows, when kinematic (path)
information is held constant (panel A.), changing structural information about sex leads to systematic
changes in the proportion of times each model is judged as looking "male" and those changes are
similar for both upright (solid line) and inverted (dashed line) walkers. Models with strong female
structural cues almost never are judged as looking male. As the strength of the male structural cues
increases, so do the proportions of times the models are judged as male at both orientations. That pat-
tern is not replicated when holding structural cues constant. Varying the kinematic information about
sex (panel B.) leads to a similar pattern of change in the proportion of "male" responses when walkers
are upright. However, that pattern changes when walkers are inverted. For inverted walkers with only
kinematic cues signalling sex, the proportion of "male" responses initially increases as the strength
of the cues to femaleness decrease. The function peaks for the weakest male models. As the strength
of the male cues continues to increase, the proportions of times the inverted walkers are judged as
male systematically declines. That is, when information about sex is carried only by kinematic cues,
inverted male walkers look increasingly female as cues to maleness increase.
Planned contrasts were run to test for a main effect of orientation on each of the two different
model sets. Dealing first with the "Structure" condition, orientation had no effect on perceived sex
(F1,13
= 0.31, p = .59). Conversely, and as predicted, orientation did have a systematic impact when
walker sex was defined by kinematics (F1,13
= 11.50, p = .005). A post hoc t-test revealed that the 0/16
model (neutral structural cues to sex paired with strong kinematic cues) was judged as female at a rate
almost at chance (t13
= 1.67, p = .23).
Figure 2. Proportion of "male" responses for each model at each orientation tested. The two components
comprising each walker are shown on the abscissa. Mean proportions are shown on the ordinate. A. Holding
kinematic cues constant and varying structural cues to sex leads to predictable and systematic changes in the
perceived sex of the 13 different walkers tested.As sex cues change systematically from extreme female structure
(26/0 model) to extreme male structure (16/0 model), the proportions of "male" judgements increases for both
upright (solid line) and inverted (dashed line) walkers. B. Holding structure constant and varying kinematic cues
to sex gives a different result. In this case, inversion leads to the weakest male walkers (0/0, 0/11, 0/12, 0/13)
looking most male. Inversion reduces the perceived maleness of the most extreme male (0/14, 0/15, 0/16)
walkers. Error bars represent 1 standard error.
125 Fitzgerald S-A, Brooks A, van der Zwan R, Blair D
Another way of representing those data are shown in Figure 3. For each participant, a differ-
ence score was calculated by subtracting the proportion of "male" responses for each upright model
from the proportion of "male" responses for each inverted model. 95% confidence intervals were then
constructed for each set of models. As shown in Figure 3, structural cues (blue) to sex were almost
unaffected by orientation: Almost every interval captures 0. The pattern is very different for kinematic
(red) cues. As maleness increases, there is a systematic decline in the difference scores, consistent with
inverted walkers looking increasingly female.
3.3
Conclusion
Results of Experiment 1 support the hypothesis that inversion significantly affects sex perceptions
based on kinematic cues but not sex perceptions based on structural cues. In particular, and as illus-
trated in Figures 2 & 3, inversion has little effect on sex perceptions generated by point-light models
varying only in structural sex cues. Models with strong female cues are perceived as female, models
with strong male cues are perceived as male. That pattern changes when sex cues are carried by
kinematic information. In that case, and just as when structure carries sex information, upright walk-
ers are reliably discriminated as female and male in a pattern consistent with the kinematic sex-cue
information carried in each walker. When those walkers are inverted, female walkers generally are
perceived as female. Male walkers with weak sex cues are perceived as male. However, as male sex
cues increase in strength, walkers increasingly are perceived as female.
As such, present data tie together two key biological motion processing models. First, the present
data suggest that of the two processing streams (Troje & Westhoff, 2006) contributing to perceptions
of the sex of point-light walkers, the kinematic is more detrimentally affected by inversion than is the
structural. Those effects could be mediated via an orientation-tuned disruption to match with the stored
templates (see Troje & Westhoff, 2006). That is consistent too with Johnson and Tassinary's (2005)
sex processing-specific model. Johnson and Tassinary argue that structure-based discriminations are
more robust to the detrimental impacts of inversion than are discriminations based on kinematic cues.
The results reported here are consistent with their proposal that structure serves as the primary, direct,
and therefore more inversion-resilient cue to sex, while kinematics play a secondary role that is more
susceptible to inversion effects.
Figure 3. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) for difference scores for each model set. For each participant, a
difference score was calculated by subtracting for each model tested their proportion of "male" responses to
upright walkers from their proportion to inverted walkers. 95% CIs were then constructed for each model. A score
of 0 means there were no differences between performances on upright and inverted walkers. Positive scores
indicated inverted walkers look more male. Negative scores indicated inverted walkers look more female. The
blue interval is for models where the sex cue is carried by structural cues. The red interval is for models where the
sex cue is carried by kinematic cues. Models are shown on the colored labels on the abscissa.
Role of kinematics in biological motion inversion effects 126
These data are not without precedent. Barclay et al. (1978) has previously reported that observers
reliably reported upside down male point-light walkers as female and vice versa for female walkers.
While the present findings support only the first of those two outcomes, they are to our knowledge
the first reported replication of Barclay et al.'s physical inversion/sex inversion relationship. Those
differences may be associated with the effects of signal strength observed in these data. Quite clearly
sex discriminations were most disrupted for those inverted walkers defined by strong male kinemat-
ics. Those walkers, like Barclay's, were perceived as female when inverted, suggesting perhaps that
at least for the male walkers used by Barclay, structural cues were not salient and their observers used
kinematic information to make their sex discriminations. That account cannot explain why Barclay's
female walkers were judged by observers to be male.
In summary, data from Experiment 1 support the proposal that inversion has a greater detrimental
impact on the processing of kinematic cues than it does on the processing of structural cues to sex.
Most importantly, in that respect, these data are consistent with Troje and Westhoff's (2006) suggestion
that inversion effects are driven by a disruption to kinematic processing ahead of structure process-
ing, and with Johnson and Tassinary's (2005) sex processing-specific model in which structure is the
primary cue to sex. That summary is based on a unique feature of the data reported here: Observers
based their sex discriminations on either kinematic or structural cues. The question thus arises whether
compatible patterns of responding would manifest for point-light walkers in which both carriers simul-
taneously were available. That is, if walkers varied in terms of both their structural and their kinematic
cues to sex would the same effects be observed? That question is addressed by Experiment 2.
4 Experiment 2
In Experiment 1, the advantage of the methodological approach adopted was that it afforded the ability
to isolate the inversion effects arising with respect to kinematic and structural processing individually.
As noted above, that approach also has associated with it some limitations: In regular point-light
walkers, sex typically is conveyed by the dual cues of structure and kinematics simultaneously. So,
while data from Experiment 1 are consistent with the view that inversion has a more catastrophic
impact upon the observer's ability to exploit kinematic than structural cues to sex, at least for male
walkers, the question does arise as to whether such effects would be maintained when both carriers
simultaneously are available.
To that end, Experiment 2 was conducted to test the impact of inversion on perceptions of point-
light walkers comprised simultaneously of structural and kinematic cues to sex. Specifically, two
objectively sex-structured walkers (structure levels 21 female and 11 male) were paired with both
female and male kinematic cues in combinations that were either complementary (female/female) or
contradictory (male/female) in terms of sex cues. In Experiment 2a, combinations comprised female
and male structural walkers onto which seven different levels of female kinematic cues were imposed.
In Experiment 2b, the combinations comprised seven levels of male kinematics. Upright and inverted
versions of each stimulus set were created.
Using those stimuli, and based on the data from Experiment 1, it was predicted that inversion
effects would manifest only on walkers with male kinematics. In particular, it was predicted that
systematically different performances for upright and inverted walkers would not manifest in sex dis-
criminations for the stimuli used in Experiment 2a (where both female and male structures had female
kinematics). It was predicted that differences between performances on upright and inverted walkers
would be observed in Experiment 2b (where both female and male structures had male kinematics).
A secondary aim was to investigate the tuning of structure-based supremacy in driving perceptual
outcomes. Put simply, we tested the effect of signal strength on perceptual outcomes for each type of
walker in each of the orientations in which they were presented.
4.1
Experiment 2a: Female kinematics
The aim of Experiment 2a was to test the impact of inversion on sex discriminations of point-light
walkers in which the structural cues were female or were male and the kinematic cues all female.
Based on the data from Experiment 1, it was predicted that, if inversion effects are driven by kinematic
rather than structural cues, there would be no systematic effects of inversion on sex discriminations
for female and male structural point-light walkers when those were paired with female kinematics.

4.1.1
Methods
Methods were as described above with the following changes: Two different sets of structural coordi-
nates, those of the 21 (female) model and those of the 11 (male) model had paired with them seven
different kinematic models, each carrying female sex cues of different strengths: 26, 25, 24, 23, 22,
21, & 0. For each of those 14 models, an upright and an inverted version was created and the stimuli pre-
sented as a single randomized block comprised 280 trials (14 exemplars  2 orientations  10 repeats).
4.2
Results
As previously, results here are expressed as mean proportions of male responses across participants
for each structure/kinematic sex cue combination--Figure 4. Proportions less than 0.5 are consistent
with systematically "female" responses, proportions greater than 0.5 are consistent with systemati-
cally "male" responses. Female kinematic cues are represented along the x-axis from strongest on the
left to weakest on the right (so in decreasing strength of female sex cue). As can be seen in Figure 4,
when female kinematic cues were paired with a female structural cue, point-light walkers look female
when the kinematic cues to sex are strong and look increasingly male as the strength of the female
kinematic cues diminish. That pattern of discriminations is consistent for both upright and inverted
walkers although it does appear, for the strongest kinematic cues, that inversion reduces the salience
of the female cues to sex (see General Discussion). When female kinematic cues are paired with a
male structural cue, the point-light walkers look more male as the female kinematic cues weaken in
strength. Indeed, only when female kinematics were imposed on the objectively female (21) structure
did participants reliably report the walkers as looking female. When paired with the objectively male
structure (11), even the strongest female kinematic cue (26) did not give rise to perceptions that
reliably were female: A post hoc t-test on the proportion of "male" responses for the 11/26 model
showed the rate of responding not to be different from 0.5 (t13
= 0.76, p = .40). Most importantly, from
all these data, there seems to be no systematic effect of stimulus inversion.
Planned orthogonal contrasts tested the main effects of orientation (upright vs inverted walkers)
and kinematic sex cue signal strength. As predicted, no main effect of orientation was observed for
either the objectively female (21) structure (F1,13
= 2.25, p = .16) or the objectively male (11) struc-
ture (F1,13
= 0.67, p = .43). That is, no systematic effect of orientation was observed for either set of
combinations when the kinematic sex signal was female. The strength of the female kinematic cues did
influence perceptions: Perceived sex changed systematically as a function of female kinematic signal
strength for both the female (F1,13
= 43.7, p  .001 for upright, F1,13
= 12.8, p = .003 for inverted) and
the male (F1,13
= 16.64, p = .001 for upright, F1,13
= 28.1, p  .001 for inverted) structural cues. In
summary, there were no systematic effects of stimulus inversion on the perceived sex of structurally
female and structurally male point-light walkers when those walkers carried female kinematic cues.
4.3
Experiment 2b: Male kinematics
The aim of Experiment 2b was to test the impact of inversion on sex discriminations of point-light
walkers in which the structural cues were female or were male and the kinematic cues all male. Based
Figure 4. A. Mean proportions of "male" responses for upright (solid line) and inverted (dashed line) point-light
walkers with female structure (21) imposed on female kinematics (26 to 0). B. Mean proportions of "male"
responses for upright (solid line) and inverted (dashed line) point-light walkers with male structure (11) imposed
on female kinematics (26 to 0). In both figures, error bars represent 1 standard error of the mean.

light walkers with female structure (21) imposed on male kinematics (0 to 16). B. Mean proportions of "male"
responses for upright (solid line) and inverted (dashed line) point-light walkers with male structure (11) imposed

on the data from Experiment 1, it was predicted that, if inversion effects are driven by kinematic rather
than structural cues, there would be systematic effects of inversion on sex discriminations for female
and male structural point-light walkers when those were paired with male kinematics.
4.3.1
Methods
The methods here were as for Experiment 2a except that instead of pairing the female and male struc-
tural models with female kinematics, male kinematics were used. That is, female (21) and male (11)
structural models were paired with 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, & 0 kinematic cues.
4.3.2
Results
Using the previous conventions, Figure 5 shows the mean sex discrimination performances for the
stimuli tested here. The patterns of responding are very different from Experiment 2a: There is little
effect of male kinematic sex cues strength, except when those were paired with the female structural
cues. That is likely to be a ceiling effect. All the upright walkers tested here were very often perceived
to be male. There was a strong and systematic effect of inversion and that effect was impacted by the
strength of the male kinematic sex cue. In particular, inversion systematically reduced the proportions
of times every stimulus tested was perceived to be male.
The main effect of orientation was significant for both the objectively female-structured walkers
(F1,13
= 8.43, p = .012) and for the objectively male-structured walkers (F1,13
= 13.31, p = .003). In
both cases, the proportion of "male" discriminations was significantly reduced by inversion, suggest-
ing inversion made the walkers look more female. Male kinematic sex cue strength had no systematic
effect on sex discrimination performances for upright walkers with female (F1,13
= 0.02, p = .90) and
male (F1,13
= 0.1, p = .76) structures. Similarly, male kinematic sex cue strength had no effect on
sex discrimination performances for inverted male structures (F1,13
= 2.75, p = .12). However, male
kinematics significantly affected performance when paired with female structure (F1,13
= 6.09, p = .03).
Specifically, and as in Experiment 1, stronger male kinematics, when presented upside down, looked
less "male", although even for the combination of female structure with the strongest male kinematic
sex cue the walkers never were reliably reported as looking female (t13
= 0.53, p = .48). In summary,
and as predicted, when point-light walkers carry male kinematic cues to sex, inversion affects sex
perceptions and does so when combined with both female and male structural cues.

Conclusion
Experiment 2 had two primary aims. Experiment 2a was designed to test the impact of female kin-
ematics on sex discriminations of point-light walkers in which the structural cues were female or
were male. Experiment 2b was designed to test, on the same structural cues, the impact of inversion
on perceptions driven by male kinematic sex cues. It was predicted that systematic inversion effects
would be seen only for walkers with male kinematics. The data confirm that prediction. While sex dis-
criminations of walkers containing only female kinematic cues to sex were mediated by the strength of
129 Fitzgerald S-A, Brooks A, van der Zwan R, Blair D
those cues, there were no systematic differences in those effects produced by inversion. In comparison,
sex discriminations of walkers containing only male kinematic cues showed only weak tuning for the
strength of the cues (probably a ceiling effect) but strong effects of inversion. For every stimulus, the
proportion of "male" responses elicited was reduced when the stimulus was inverted. In summary,
Experiment 2 confirms that inversion effects are mediated by the effect of the change of orientation on
the processing of kinematic sex cues when those cues are male. In addition, Experiment 2 shows that
those effects on kinematic processes are, for the structural configurations used here, independent of the
sex of the structural cues presented with them.
With that in mind, data from Experiments 2a and 2b provide further confirmation of the models of
biological motion processing described by Troje and Westhoff (2006) and by Johnson and Tassinary
(2005). Troje and Westhoff proposed that the inversion effect is due primarily to impairments, when
figures are upside down, of the visual system's ability to interpret task-relevant kinematics. In terms of
sex discriminations, the data reported here confirm a critical role for kinematics in inversion effects.
Similarly, these data are consistent with Johnson and Tassinary's proposal that sex perceptions are
driven directly by structural cues--a process these data suggest is not orientation-tuned--and indi-
rectly by kinematic cues. These data suggest that kinematic signals can systematically influence sex
perception, but only in a secondary relationship to more heavily weighted structural information.
5 General Discussion
This study was designed to investigate the mechanisms mediating inversion effects on biological
motion perceptions. As noted above, traditional accounts of the mechanisms of those effects have
focused on the impact of orientation changes on structural processing mechanisms (Bertenthal &
Pinto, 1994; Dittrich, 1993; Proffitt & Bertenthal, 1990; Shiffrar et al., 1997). Turning a body repre-
sentation upside down, it classically has been argued, catastrophically impacts upon the visual sys-
tem's ability to exploit learned structural relationships and that, in turn, impacts on myriad perceptual
tasks (Bertenthal & Pinto, 1994; Reed et al., 2003; Shiffrar et al., 1997). Those effects include, but
are not limited to, discriminations of biological sex (Barclay et al., 1978). More recently, however,
the explanatory power of the so-called "shape inversion effect" has been called into question (Troje
& Westhoff, 2006). At least in the case of biological motion processing, there is reason to believe
the impacts on perception resulting from physical inversion may arise primarily as a consequence of
resulting distortions in the visual system's ability to process kinematic information (Troje & Westhoff,
2006). What is interesting about that proposal is that Johnson and Tassinary (2005) also developed an
account of biological motion processing, this time for the mechanisms giving rise to sex perceptions
specifically, that holds that sex perceptions arise primarily through structural processing. They propose
that kinematic sex cues play a secondary role. In terms of inversion effects--turning their hypothesis
on its head, so to speak--their model predicts that the weaker driver of sex perceptions, kinematics,
will, when processing cues changed by orientation, be more deleteriously impacted than structural
cues. That is, both models predict that sex perceptions mediated by structural cues will be more robust
to orientation changes than sex perceptions mediated by kinematic cues.
The primary goal of the experiments reported here was to test that prediction. In Experiment 1,
participants judged the sex of point-light walkers composed of independent structural and kinematic
cues to sex. Sex cues were carried either by structural or by kinematic cues. The only systematic
effects of inversion were observed for kinematic cues, and only for male kinematic cues. In those
circumstances, the proportions of times walkers were judged to be male were reduced. The goal of
Experiment 2 was to further test that relationship between orientation, structural cues, and kinematics.
In Experiment 2, kinematic sex cues were paired with objective female or male structural cues. The
data confirmed that orientation not only selectively impacts on the processing of kinematic cues, and
that those effects are specific to male kinematics, but that those effects occur relatively independently
of the structural cues that are present. In addition to that, signal strength did not, in the case of male
kinematics at least, have an across-the-board impact--only for the inverted female-structured walkers
did greater signal strength result in reduced male responses. No similar tuning effects were observed
when male kinematics were paired with either female or male structures. In summary, the data are
evidence that kinematic signals can influence sex perceptions even when sex-specific structural cues
are available: while structural cues are primary when walkers are right side up, kinematic signals can
drive perceptions when those same walkers are presented upside down.
Role of kinematics in biological motion inversion effects 130
In addition to those systematic effects, there were a number of point-light walker models that seem
to give rise to different patterns of responding depending on their orientation. In Experiment 1, the pro-
portions of "male" responses for the most sexually ambiguous models (using the structure/kinematic
convention), the 0/0 and 1/0 models, were lower than might be expected given the systematic changes
across the rest of the models. Similarly, in Experiment 2a, two models, 21/26 and 21/25, generated
higher than expected proportions of "male" responses. In neither case is it clear why given the overall,
and systematic, changes across all the point-light walker models. One possible interpretation of those
patterns is that they reflect processes first described by Barclay et al. (1978). In that first description of
point-light walker inversion effects, Barclay's observers reported that turning the walkers upside down
seemed to change their sex. The same is true here: For those four models that seem "out of pattern,"
there is a tendency for observers more often to perceive the models as being of the opposite sex to the
objective cues present when the cues are presented upside down. Whether those reports reflect a true
perceptual reversal of the perceived sex, or perhaps a response bias ("it does not look female so it must
be male") requires further investigation.
The other effect that manifests in these data is the so-called "male bias." Here, for both the structure
(upright and inverted) and kinematics (upright only) continua, point-light walkers that actually carried
weak female cues were misperceived as male. The male bias previously has been reported to manifest
not only for point-light walkers (Troje, Sadr, Geyer, & Nakayama, 2006; Troje & Szabo, 2006), but
also for hands (Gaetano, Brooks, & van der Zwan, 2012; Gaetano, Brooks, van der Zwan, Hayward, &
Oxner, 2013; Gaetano, van der Zwan, Blair, & Brooks, 2014), and for faces (Hess, Adams, Grammer,
& Kleck, 2009). That it manifests here in both conditions suggests that for point-light walkers at least,
the bias is driven by both structure and kinematics processing mechanisms. Again, the mechanisms
mediating that effect need systematic investigation.
While the outcomes reported here support the major existing models, they also give rise to at least
one important additional question: Why does inversion selectively disrupt the processing of kinematics
characteristic of males, to the point where in some cases sex is reliably misperceived (Experiment 1,
supported by patterns in Experiment 2)? While physical/perceptual inversion relationships have previ-
ously been reported (Barclay et al., 1978), our data suggest they arise specifically in cases involving
male kinematics. Because the effect arose with respect to two types of point-light walkers--one in
which sex was defined by a single carrier (Experiment 1), and a second in which dual carriers were
present (Experiment 2)--the effect seems unlikely to be a stimulus-based artifact. But the question of
why the visual system is particularly susceptible to the effects of inverting male kinematics or perhaps
conversely, why characteristically female motion shows no comparable effect, remains unanswered.
Data from both orientations tested here show that the presence of female kinematics is factored into
resulting sex perceptions. So, we know at least that the absence of an orientation effect with respect
to female kinematics cannot be based on a complete reliance when processing those walkers on their
sex-specific structural cues.
Overall then, the present data provide novel insight into an effect that has for many years interested
psychophysicists and laypeople alike. Inversion, as we know from demonstrations like the Thatcher
Illusion (Thompson, 1980) and the artistry of a pencil-nosed puppet, has a serious negative impact on
the ability to process visual information, including in the case of human body representations. Here,
we have shown that that impact is caused in large part by impairment of kinematic processing abilities.
Simultaneously, our data show that kinematics do nonetheless feature into judgements of sex, even
when structural information is available. As such, we provide support for the complimentary--with
respect at least to inverted-figure processing--models proposed by Troje and Westhoff (2006) and
Johnson and Tassinary (2005). Taken together, their models and our data suggest that in the case of
biological motion processing structural and kinematic cues contribute hierarchically to sex percep-
tions. Specifically, mechanisms processing structural cues are relatively robust to inversion. Mecha-
nisms processing kinematic cues are not.
