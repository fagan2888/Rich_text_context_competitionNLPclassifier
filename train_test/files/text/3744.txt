Energy Depoliticisation in the UK:
Destroying Political Capacity
Caroline Kuzemko
Research Highlights and Abstract
· Provides new insights into depoliticisation literatures by applying depoliticisation
beyond economic and monetary policy to energy and climate change policy.
· Demonstrates ways in which forms of depoliticisation can affect political capacity to
respond to new policy challenges.
· Challenges climate change and energy transition literatures by explaining how and
why UK energy policy institutions have constrained innovation and sustainable
change.
Depoliticisation, as a concept, has been utilised to explain specific aspects of economic governance as
it has developed over the past thirty years, particularly in certain OECD countries. This article
focuses on the outcomes of three forms of depoliticisation, marketised, technocratic and non-
deliberative, for political capacity. Political capacity is defined in relation to a notion of politics as
social interaction, deliberation, choice and agency. Using UK energy governance as a case study it
claims that the depoliticisation of energy policy has resulted in embedded corporate power, a
widening disjuncture between experts and majoritarian institutions and limited knowledge struc-
tures. As a result the state's role is still confined to giver of market signals and to temporary
interventions in the face of complex and unprecedented commitments to transition the UK towards
a low carbon future.

Introduction
UK energy governance institutions have been facing considerable new challenges
and contestations for the past decade or so. For a period of time, principally in the
1990s, the pro-market energy model appeared to work reasonably well with energy
companies managing to deliver affordable and reliable energy to UK consumers. As
of the mid-2000s, however, it started to become apparent that markets were at risk
of under-delivering on energy supply security and affordability whilst climate
change mitigation had become politically far more salient (see Lockwood 2013).
Scientific arguments about anthropogenic climate change as well as debates about
dwindling oil resources, the UK's ageing energy infrastructures and rising electricity
and gas prices have together resulted in various, ongoing repoliticisations of energy
as an issue area (Kuzemko 2013, 2014). Recognition of these concerns and con-
testations has been evident in the adoption of a number of new energy policy
objectives and in some attempts to redesign UK energy governance institutions. For

example, the UK over the course of the 2000s has adopted the Climate Change Act,
a set of legally binding carbon dioxide emissions reductions targets, has set up the
Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), has devised some plans to
transition to a low carbon economy as well as adopting important new energy
security and poverty objectives (DTI 2003; HMG 2008a; HMG 2008b).
However it is one thing setting targets and another delivering on them. It is starting
to become apparent that delivering on climate change objectives whilst ensuring
secure and affordable supplies is no mean feat--it can be described as highly
complex, a Herculean task as well as completely unprecedented in policy terms (see
Smith 2009). It has also been widely observed that UK energy governance institu-
tions, despite the high number of new policies and Acts of Parliament over this time
period, so far appear unable to successfully deliver these complex new energy
policy objectives (Mitchell 2008; Scrase and Ockwell 2009; Smith 2009; Lockwood
2013). For example it can be argued that fossil fuels still dominate the energy mix,
the UK remains quite far off its 20-20-20 renewable energy target, energy poverty
is growing, gas and electricity prices have risen rapidly and some vital new infra-
structure, generation and technology investments are not materialising at the speed
and scale required. This is clearly not to claim that there have been no changes in
energy policy, but that changes have been insufficient in terms of timing, profundity
and quality to have sufficient impact in terms of a sustainable, secure and affordable
energy transition.
One explanation for underwhelming achievements so far has been the degree to
which energy policy has been bounded ideologically, thereby constraining the
range of choices and/or policy instruments available to policy-makers (Mitchell
2008; Smith 2009; Rutledge 2010). Others have also pointed to a high degree of,
related, institutional inertia and insufficient state involvement in supporting energy
transitions (Fouquet 2010, 6595; Lehtonen and Kern 2009, 103). These explana-
tions tend to emphasise the static nature of energy governance whereas arguably
new policy objectives are evidence of change and strong contestations have been
and remain evident in political debates. This article argues that the ability of the
political system to deliver new objectives and respond to ongoing politicisations has
been, and still is, limited by a lack of political capacity brought about in part by
various forms of depoliticisation. Specifically it argues that it is the forms that
energy depoliticisations took, within specific ideational contexts, which have
reinforced inertia and underpinned a lack of state capacity to manage, coordinate
and deliver collective energy and climate goals. In this way this article makes a
contribution to two areas--to understandings of the impacts of depoliticisations on
certain forms of political capacity and to understanding how political practices
constrain and colour sustainable energy transitions.
The article proceeds as follows: the first half outlines three heuristic forms of
depoliticisation and explains how and why these were deployed within UK energy
policy over the course of the 1980s and 1990s. Inter-relationships between ideas,
forms of depoliticisation, path dependency and change are explored and empha-
sised as important explanatory variables. The second half assesses in more detail the
ways in which forms of depoliticisation, once institutionalised within political
practice, resulted in embedded corporate power, weak political institutions and an

inability to question or reach far beyond market liberal orthodoxies. This work has
been informed empirically by analysis of energy policy, consultation and strategy
documents conducted over a six-year period with an emphasis on ideas, institu-
tional structures and mandates and interactions between drivers for and resistances
to change. Evidence from these documents has been cross-checked against insights
gleaned from 22 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders, often at a senior
level, who have been involved in energy policy-making and regulation.
1. Depoliticisation and UK Energy Governance
Depoliticisation, or delegation, has been referred to by politicians, civil servants and
some academics as positive--as a solution to a variety of political problems often
perceived in terms of government overload (see Flinders and Buller 2006, 294;
Hay 2007, 91). By contrast this article situates itself with respect to critical
depoliticisation literatures wherein decisions to pass responsibility and accountabil-
ity in a given issue area away from government are understood as undemocratic in
practice (Burnham 2001; Flinders and Buller 2006; Hay 2007; Kettell 2008; Rogers
2009; Jenkins 2011; Mügge 2011; Wood and Flinders 2014). Depoliticisation is
often conceptualised within this literature as a governing strategy, tactic or tool
pursued specifically with the intention of avoiding both accountability for and
deliberation and debate over certain issue areas (Burnham 2001; Kettell 2008). This
in practice reduces the discretionary nature of decision-making replacing it with a
more `rules-based' system over which civil servants and politicians have less active
day-to-day control (Burnham 2001, 136). In practice depoliticisation is understood
to take a variety of forms including a passing of responsibility from government to
the private sector and/or from government bodies to quasi-public or independent
bodies (Hay 2007, 82­85; see also Flinders and Buller 2006; Wood and Flinders
2014).
As will be seen below the forms that depoliticisation in UK energy governance took
can be understood largely within these parameters but there is, however, one
interesting point of departure that this article identifies and explores. This has to do
with claims here about links between depoliticisations and political capacity in the
face of repoliticisations. Although interactions between depoliticisations and
repoliticisations are recognised within these literatures they have tended to empha-
sise the path dependent nature of successfully depoliticised issue areas. This is partly
because by conceptualising depoliticisation as a governing strategy whereby state
managers actively seek to insulate themselves from negative outcomes the empha-
sis is often on a lack of willingness to change from current systems of governance
(Burnham 2001; Kettell 2008; Rogers 2009). A central aspect of this explanation is
the paradoxical nature of depoliticisation whereby governments are understood to
be deliberately enhancing political control through processes of delegation
(Burnham 2014). The starting point of analysis here is different in that there is
recognition of some political desire to change as evidenced in new (legally binding)
policy objectives, but the argument here is that government has not maintained
political control over the institutions that decide upon and deliver energy policy
objectives.

110 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 18(1)
What this article further suggests is that the lack of political capacity to respond,
even when willing, to pressures to change is partly related to how energy has been
depoliticised. This approach rests upon the notion that depoliticisations are contex-
tually contingent at points in time (see Kettell 2008, 635). In seeking to understand
depoliticisation as contingent we can turn to analyses that see depoliticisation not
just as a tool or as `statecraft' but also as related to ideas (Hay 2007, 94; see also
Jenkins 2011; Kuzemko 2013). In this way decisions to depoliticise are not only
tactical and strategic but are often also informed by genuinely held ideas about
what is deemed right (see also Hall 1993; Campbell 1998). As such it becomes
important to understand which norms become embedded within processes of
depoliticisation--for example, in this instance, pro-market ideas about appropriate
governance interactions between states and markets.
Embedded pro-market ideas have, in practice, served to negate other sets of ideas
about how to govern and stand in contrast to conceptions of politics as the capacity
for collective agency and choice underpinned by open and informed deliberation
and social interaction (Hay 2007, 65­70; see also Gamble 2000; Jenkins 2011).
Such observations on what politics is, or should be, are in some respects similar to
scholars studying sustainable energy policy and transitions. It has been observed,
for example, that the current energy policymaking `technocracy' needs to abandon
neoclassical economic theory and investigate and deliberate much more broadly
(Lehtonen and Kern 2009, 107). This claim relates to the notion that because low
carbon energy transition is unprecedented it can only come about through knowl-
edge building and learning-by-doing and with the state acting as an informed force
for innovation and change (Mazzucato 2013, 5; Lehtonen and Kern 2009). To an
extent, therefore, depoliticisation can be used as a tool to help explain why these
forms of political institutions have not been utilised in the UK in response to the
recognised need to transition to a low carbon economy.
1.1. `Marketised' Depoliticisations
In order to explore the contingent nature of energy depoliticisations and their
impacts on the practice of energy and climate politics this article proceeds by
separating depoliticisation into three forms that have been particularly evident. The
purpose here is not to suggest and or describe alternative forms of depoliticisation
but to apply them as heuristics to study these processes and their impacts in
practice. Particular attention is paid to identifying ideas that motivated these pro-
cesses and the kinds of rules and norms about how to govern energy that became
embedded as a result.
The first process explored here, labelled `marketised depoliticisation', is closely
related to Colin Hay's `Type One' depoliticisation in that it involves the:
... off-loading of areas of formal political responsibility to the market
(through privatisation) (Hay 2007, 82).
To the extent that market actors as a result of privatisation became responsible for
the provision of certain goods and services this state-market relationship can be
understood as the state seeking to achieve its objectives through markets (see also
Burnham 2011, 465). Although energy privatisations arguably also served the

purpose of re-filling empty state coffers as well as various private, commercial
interests (Wilks 2013, 124­127), decisions to pursue marketised depoliticisation
were also informed by sets of economic ideas. These decisions were made within
the context of a wider shift from Keynesian to neoliberal economic thinking that
had gained much political ground in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Neoliberal
economic, and public choice, ideas became influential over economic policy partly
in response to the successful characterisation of 1970s economic crises as `bureau-
cratic overload' and government failure (Hay 2007, 98).
The provision of energy goods and services via publically owned energy companies
had increasingly been presented as problematic and as exacerbating problems of
overload. Specifically some economists had over the course of the 1970s cast doubt
on the adequacy of political rules for achieving `efficient allocation of resources' and
on the merit of running utilities in order to achieve political ends such as the
redistribution of income and power (Littlechild 1981, 11­12). Some of the econo-
mists and politicians that had advanced these ideas became, under the new Con-
servative government, responsible for the (long) process of privatisation and
liberalisation as well as drawing up the new regulatory regime (Helm 2003). In this
way the new objective of policy became the establishment and maintenance of
economically efficient, freely trading energy markets--but within the context of
economic policy as a whole. The task of government became therefore constrained
to setting:
...a framework which will ensure that the market operates in the energy
sector with a minimum of distortion ... (Lawson 1989, 23).
Although the passing of responsibility for energy provision to market actors was by
no means straightforward in practice, not least because of the strength of opposition
from coal mining unions, by and large oil, gas and electricity companies had been
privatised by the mid 1990s (see Helm 2003). As observed by Stephen Wilks
privatised companies had considerable assets, which in the case of energy compa-
nies had been paid for by the state, and this made them powerful political actors by
virtue of their absolute size and their position in the corporate elite (Wilks 2013,
127; see also Smith 2009). Through processes of marketised depoliticisation the role
of the state within energy governance shifted, in addition, from one of responsibil-
ity for national planning, infrastructure development and energy provision to
neutral overseer and upholder of an agreed set of market rules and principles.
Processes of marketised depoliticisation may have served to embed certain eco-
nomic ideas in practice and to distance the state from the explicit need to provide
energy as a public good but there have been other consequences. One is that the
private sector became responsible for the typically large energy system investments
required to provide reliable energy services--these include exploration and devel-
opment as well as electricity generation, transmission and distribution. To this
extent the UK government became dependent upon the private sector to deliver
goods and services upon which the UK population rely heavily to facilitate day-to-
day life. This article will argue, below, that processes of marketised depoliticisation
have ultimately contributed to particular asymmetries of power between state and
market actors in energy making certain forms of agency problematic in response to

overt, new climate and security objectives. This is an argument about political
capacity to act to deliver collective good on an absolute and relative basis.
1.2. `Technocratic' Depoliticisation
The second form of depoliticisation that has had an impact on the areas and
processes through which UK energy governance decisions have been taken is
termed here `technocratic' depoliticisation. This form also stems from Hay's `Type
One' depoliticisation and occurs when an issue area, such as energy, that had been
subject to formal political deliberation and accountability becomes displaced to
less obviously politicised arenas such as quasi-public or independent bodies (Hay
2007, 83). This form is similar in many respects to the notion of `institutional'
depoliticisation (Flinders and Buller 2006, 297­298) but what is emphasised here is
the central role of technocratic experts and communities as opposed to majoritarian
institutions within governance processes. Technocratic depoliticisation has been
applied, for obvious reasons, particularly successfully to issue areas that are con-
sidered to be highly technical and complex in nature (Hay 2007, 83). Government
actors and civil servants that have espoused this form of depoliticisation often do so
on the grounds that (generalist) political actors are simply not qualified to take
effective decisions in such technical, expert areas (Interviews 1, 2, 11 and 12). Such
arguments are, as discussed in more detail below, somewhat self-fulfilling.
UK energy policy is understood here to have been subject to technocratic
depoliticisation during the 1990s under both Conservative and Labour administra-
tions. This is not to say that energy had not previously been depoliticised in this
way, indeed it has been argued that nationalised energy companies had operated
according to a high degree of technical dominance over decision-making (Helm
2003, 22­23). Furthermore, in 1969 the Ministry of Power was disbanded--albeit
a new Department of Energy (DoE) was formed only a few years later in response
to the oil crises of 1970s. National energy companies had, however, been put in
place with the objective of delivering a collective good in the form of secure and
affordable energy services to all UK households and they were also responsible for
carrying out a national energy plan (Helm 2003).
Technocratic depoliticisation in the 1980s and 1990s was, however, informed by
different ideas and has produced in practice markedly different processes and areas
of energy decision making. Of particular relevance this time was the idea that a
separation be made in governance terms between energy, as an economic sector,
and politics, understood as state planning and public energy (Bromley 1991, 49;
Helm 2003, 386). Margaret Thatcher had famously observed at the time that the
title Department of Energy `... smacks of economic planning whereas our energy
needs should be supplied by the market' (Thatcher in Blackhurst 2004). In 1992,
once the process of privatisation had been launched, the DoE was again dissolved
and responsibility for energy was placed within a sub-division of the Department
for Trade and Industry (DTI). The decision was also taken that there should be an
industry regulator, which ultimately became known as Ofgem, but that it should be
independent of government.
This arrangement remained in place from 1992 until 2008 when DECC was formed
but this fundamental lack of capacity dedicated to energy governance had some
6 CAROLINE KUZEMKO

particular lasting implications. Over time links to majoritarian institutions, such as
Parliament, became more tenuous. There was no longer a Secretary of State for
Energy, representation of energy issues at Cabinet level and, over the 1990s,
Parliamentary energy debates when they occurred were focused largely on how
best to privatise and liberalise energy (see Helm 2003). Energy became increasingly
less `visible' as a policy area within majoritarian governance institutions. In this way
it increasingly did become a technical sector of the economy suitable to the rigorous
quantitative analysis of experts rather than elected representatives of state which
further isolated energy from public debate and democratic scrutiny. All this suggests
that the way in which these institutions were depoliticised was about embedding
limited state involvement rather than equipping energy institutions to identify or
respond to societal outcomes of energy policy. As can be seen below the result of
such processes was that energy had become the responsibility of technocrats who
although more independent from government had firmer links with narrow gas
and electricity company interests than with majoritarian politics.
1.3. Non-deliberative Depoliticisation
Non-deliberative depoliticisation as understood here tends to cut across
current characterisations of depoliticisation in that it does not sit squarely within
any existing definition. There are resonances with Hay's `Type 3' and with
depoliticisation understood as re-enforcing rules and as preference shaping
(Flinders and Buller 2006, 299) but with less of an emphasis on citing external
pressures and on politics as `fate'. This heuristic is closest in sense to Wood and
Flinder's `discursive' depoliticisation, in that language and ideas are important, but
again the emphasis here is less on the intention to close down debate and more on
explaining why. Non-deliberative depoliticisation in energy refers to a lack of open
and informed debate and deliberation within and between actor groups which, in
turn, serves to shape and constrain choices. It is inspired by a long tradition of
academic and fictional work that has actively critiqued politics as orthodoxy
(Orwell 1946; Berlin 1978; Gamble 2000).
Again, the design of political institutions and how they operate is held here to
be important to understanding the drivers and impacts of non-deliberative
depoliticisation. We can learn more about how institutions can operate to limit
deliberation by turning to the work of sociological and discursive institutionalists
(Yee 1996; Schmidt and Radaelli 2004). Institutions can and do, in practice, allow
or restrict the access of certain social groups to political leaders and bureaucratic
officials (Yee 1996, 92) and set the parameters of what people talk about (Schmidt
and Radaelli 2004, 197). This is arguably often the case with quasi-public institu-
tions with less public visibility of their decisions and actions. What also becomes
important is who is hired, what qualifications they have, what training is received
once hired, but ultimately which actors may offer credible information (Hay and
Wincott 1998, 954; see also Adler and Haas 1992).
We can see these forms of closed communities in operation in energy--particularly
in the 1990s and early to mid 2000s. Ofgem and the Energy Directorate of the DTI
were run by groups of likeminded experts and these experts tended to seek advise
from other similarly trained groups such as accountancy firms (Mitchell 2008;
ENERGY DEPOLITICISATION IN THE UK 7

114 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 18(1)
Carrington 2011; see also Ernst and Young 2006). The Energy Directorate of the DTI
and Ofgem were, furthermore, mandated to maintain freely trading, competitive
markets thereby protecting consumers (see also Mitchell 2008, 139; Scrase and
Ockwell 2009, 42). What is notable here is that these mandates were more about
delivering freely trading markets per se and less overtly about delivering energy
specific goals such as energy security, sustainability or affordability. In line with
such mandates qualification as expert was defined less by in depth technical
knowledge of energy markets or infrastructures but by previous, or on the job,
training in classical economics and/or statistics (Interviews 1 and 2). This appears to
have limited debate and decision making to problem solving within existing frame-
works of ideas. As can be seen below personnel assigned to the Energy Directorate
of the DTI moved from division to division on the understanding that as long as
actors understood basic economic principles they could as easily make decisions
about energy as any other sector of the economy (Interviews 5 and 12). In the
absence of much specific energy expertise decisions were based on, often bounded,
economic models and statistics (Interviews 2 and 15).
Whilst these forms of institutional design did serve to embed rules and limit choices
in practice what arguably also happened was that decision-making areas became
less able to respond in terms of understanding issues and problems as they arose. As
will be seen below, once problems were recognised and new objectives were put in
place energy policymaking institutions were less capable of offering non-market
solutions hence offering an explanation as to why UK policy has been so ideologi-
cally bounded.
2. Depoliticisations and Political Capacities in Energy
Some have argued that although climate change has presented challenges it also, at
least theoretically, presents opportunities for new approaches to energy governance
and imaginative thinking about how to facilitate the large-scale investments and
behavioural changes needed (Smith 2009, 54). This section of the article outlines
impacts of depoliticisations on energy decision-making processes that explain the
degree to which energy institutions have been slow to innovate and may prove
insufficient to deliver the new, energy specific goals adopted in the mid to late
2000s. One example of an energy policy objective that may be missed is energy
produced from renewable sources. Whilst growing, the figure remains low, at 4.1%
in 2012, versus the UK's EU 2020 target of 15% (DECC 2013a, 1). Furthermore, in
2012 4.5 million households were still in fuel poverty, a long way off the UK energy
policy objective of eradication by 2016 (DECC 2013b). Household electricity
and gas prices have risen 66% and 137% respectively between 2001 and 2013 and
continue to rise (Which 2013, 8; see also HC ECC (House of Commons Energy and
Climate Change Committee) 2013). Furthermore, energy supply security objectives
are undermined by underinvestment in Britain's ageing generation capacities.
2.1. Embedded Corporate Power
This sub-section will assess how processes of marketised depoliticisation have
played out in practice emphasising high degrees of embedded corporate power in

energy (see Wilks 2013, 130­132). As already noted above decisions to pass respon-
sibility for energy to the private sector in practice resulted in a situation where
private market actors became responsible for the provision of energy goods and
services--services that almost every household and business in society depends
upon daily. Explanations for corporate power can be found in the decision to pass
responsibility for such important services to market actors but also in how the
process of privatisation was pursued. In addition to the guiding notion of `markets
know best' there was one other, somewhat practical, principal at play during the
process of privatising energy companies which was that of making sure that the
sector was profitable enough to private investors (Thomas 2006; Wilks 2013). It has
been argued that this principal, as well as that of allowing market actors to make
decisions about the energy industry, was important to the somewhat controversial
decision to allow vertical integration in UK gas and electricity companies (Thomas
2006). Vertical integration, allowing generation and supply assets to be held by one
corporation, was not part of the original design of energy market privatisation and
liberalisation but was allowed to evolve in a piecemeal fashion as various market
actors requested it (Thomas 2006, 587; Rutledge 2010, 6­7).
The UK is serviced now by an oligopoly of six, mainly multinational owned,
integrated companies that supply 92% of the domestic electricity market and 75%
of the domestic gas market and that hold a high degree of market knowledge and
power (Rutledge 2010; Which 2013).1 Vertical integration has not only facilitated
in-house trading and procurement, with implications for transparency, liquidity
and pricing, but also provided the `Big 6' companies with high levels of knowledge
and data about UK energy markets and how they operate. This knowledge is
lucrative but also, importantly, indispensable to anyone trying to design a sustain-
able energy transition whilst also meeting affordability and security objectives
(Interviews 10, 17 and 21). Gas and electricity companies, furthermore, are not
required to share such industry knowledge and data--in fact DECC are soon to use
pooled state funds to pay industry for information that they consider vital to
making policy decisions because they simply do not have access to it (Civil Service
World 2014).
Companies have long realised the value of vertical integration (Rutledge 2010), but
political institutions are only now overtly recognising the impact that this has had
on the electricity supply industry--not least in terms of constructing barriers to
entry to more innovative and sustainable new business models (Ofgem 2014).
Incumbent companies, furthermore, use their market and political power to lobby
strongly and have been central to consultancy processes that have underpinned
new legislation (Friends of the Earth 2011; Interviews 10, 19 and 22).
As observed above, another outcome of passing responsibility to the private sector
has been that UK political institutions now rely on private companies to invest in
new energy infrastructures. Both energy security and climate change mitigation are
dependent upon sufficient investment taking place in capital-intensive infrastruc-
tures and new technologies required for security and climate change mitigation
(Smith 2009). The scale of this problem is now overtly recognised in that it is
estimated that that 20 per cent of UK electricity plant generation capacity is due to
close by 2022 whilst there are those that claim that some energy companies, post

privatisation, went about sweating their considerable assets instead of investing in
new infrastructures (Smith 2009, 54). As a consequence, and in order to deliver
only on the objective of energy supply security, DECC now estimates that £110bn
of investment in UK infrastructure is required between 2013 and 2020 (Davey
2013).
This all results in a considerable headache for UK energy policymakers--specifically
how to deliver new objectives whilst relying on private enterprises that have little
incentive to do so. The overriding difficultly here is that, although responsible for
delivering energy objectives and implementing policies, gas and electricity compa-
nies are not answerable to society as a whole but to multinational parent companies,
shareholders and, in a limited sense, to customers. The primary objective of private
gas and electricity companies is to make profits, which should preferably grow year
on year, and then to either re-invest profits back into the business or deliver
`surplus' capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and/or through share
buy-back schemes. Multinational companies can, furthermore, decide whether to
reinvest in the UK or invest profits elsewhere. In addition, dividends on offer from
the Big 6 are generous, their dividend ratios vary from 5% to 7.8%, and one
recently claimed that its strategic priority is sustained dividend growth (SSE
website). Clearly this use of `surplus' capital, at a time when the UK needs to secure
investment in aging generation and low carbon transition, is problematic for
government.
What this means is that the political capacity to implement new or alternative
policies is constrained by the need to keep incumbents in profit and shareholders
happy, and by corporate knowledge and market power. This helps us to understand
how these important power asymmetries have had an impact upon the ability of
political institutions to deliver on societal objectives, but it also helps us to under-
stand the degree to which marketised depoliticisation has served to benefit narrow
interests over the delivery of policy objectives. This observation is of note given that
some conceptualisations of depoliticisation are that delegation of responsibility is
about achieving state objectives through the market (Burnham 2011, 465).
2.2. Disjunctures Between Majoritarian Institutions
and Technocrats
The dissolution of the DoE in 1992, outlined above, and other attempts to place
decision-making at arm's length from government were compounded in the late
1990s and early 2000s by further demotions of energy down the hierarchy of
government institutions. It has been noted that personnel dedicated to carrying out
the necessary analysis and problem solving in energy were by the late 1990s and
early 2000s at a low point, and that the role of `Minister for Energy', which had
been passed around on an almost yearly basis, had been downgraded to a status
meriting only a `part-time minister', let alone a Secretary of State reporting directly
to the Cabinet (Helm 2003, 400; see also Leake 2005). This lack of government
capacity provides one explanation as to why it took such a long time, certainly in
comparison with countries like Germany, for climate change to make any serious
impact on energy policy (see Mitchell 2008). For example although some high
profile challenges had emerged, the 2000 Royal Commission on Environmental

Pollution and the 2002 Policy and Innovation Unit review of energy policy had both
recommended quite profound restructurings of energy policy, their recommenda-
tions were only partially taken up in the 2003 White Paper (PIU (Policy and
Innovation Unit) 2002; RCEP 2000; Mitchell 2008). Even post the establishment
of DECC in 2008, tacit recognition that the Energy Directorate of the DTI was
insufficient, there have been enduring limitations to understandings of the scale of
what is required. One review of DECC has highlighted the fact that whilst it is the
second smallest department in government it has the second largest portfolio to
deliver and that it does not `have the capacity to deliver its portfolio' (Civil Service
2012, 9).
Decisions to make sure that the regulator, Ofgem, should be `independent' of
government have had other implications that take us back to observations above
about relative power relations between private and public sectors. In order for
Ofgem to make significant changes to some of the regulations governing UK gas and
electricity markets, in the form of industry codes, it needs to seek the agreement of
energy incumbents (Interviews 10 and 22). For example any alterations to the
Balancing and Settlement Code (BSC), that forms a large part of how electricity and
gas companies are regulated, must be approved by the BSC Panel.2 The majority of
BSC panel members are, however, representatives of the large, incumbent gas and
electricity companies (Interviews 10 and 21). As such, even if Ofgem were to
suggest radical changes to energy governance these need the approval of the Big 6
and this has in practice tended make Ofgem less `independent' of the interests of
these companies. This matters in particular when markets are not delivering on the
objectives of policy and when the interests of the Big 6 and government are not
aligned.
There have been further consequences for political capacity in energy, and in
particular for politics as social interaction. Arm's-length energy decision-making
processes in practice isolated majoritarian institutions from thinking about energy
as a policy area. Without a Secretary of State for Energy reporting regularly to
Cabinet and or Parliament there were fewer possibilities for ongoing learning and
knowledge building through exposure to this complex subject. Those that should
serve as the formal channels of communication between society and government,
for example MPs, were in these ways left out of the energy loop thereby fulfilling
the notion that political actors cannot effectively manage. Such practices have been
exacerbated by the extent to which technocratic experts employed within energy
institutions continued to believe that politics should not interfere in economic
matters such as energy (Interviews 1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 12). In this way economic
technocrats set the parameters of how energy was analysed and discussed and the
parameters themselves, the methodologies and language used were often also
highly technical in nature and unintelligible to lay people, be they MPs or other
members of the public (Interview 10). Furthermore, technical experts purposefully
placed at arm's length from government arguably have less incentive or capacity to
understand energy policy within the broader objectives of collective social policy
(Interviews 10 and 17). This has led to observations that narrow analytical meth-
odologies adopted have resulted in missed opportunities to develop and improve
UK energy policy (Helm 2003, 395; Mitchell 2008, 31).
ENERGY DEPOLITICISATION IN THE UK 11

BJPIR, 2015
118 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 18(1)
Under conditions of technocratic depoliticisation, moreover, other members of
society also have less exposure to energy as an issue area. Households become
`consumers' that expect a certain service at a price as part of a business
relationship--neither particularly aware of the nature of energy services nor active
participants in pursuing a collective goal. The complexities of providing this service,
not least in terms of the infrastructures such as transmission grids that they are
dependent upon, have become less and less visible to end users.3 A lack of knowl-
edge about how energy systems work plays heavily to the detriment of those
policies that are designed to encourage wider participation in energy demand
reduction and efficiency improvement (see Rosenow et al. 2013). It narrows the
terms of debate down to pricing and costs in the absence of sufficient and ongoing
communication about the complex but hidden energy infrastructures and
about how households can alter their energy practices. In that technocratic
depoliticisation reduces the visibility of energy and erodes connections between
policy and society this has implications for trust in political authority (see Stern
1987, 498). One study has highlighted the erosion of trust in governance and in
political abilities to manage sustainable energy trajectories (Rayner 2009).
2.3. Negating Politics as Informed Deliberation and Choice
This last sub-section on the outcomes of depoliticisation emphasises a reduction in
the capacity for politics as deliberation and as choice between different solutions to
problems. The first point to be made here highlights the way in which parameters
set, for example mandates and hiring practices, influence a whole range of out-
comes. The tighter the boundaries are set the less possible it is to openly contest,
deliberate or to choose from different approaches to governing energy. The way in
which Ofgem and the Energy Directorate of the DTI were initially mandated and
structured served to embed the idea that the proper role of government was as a
regulator of services delivered by market organisations (Wilks 2013, 126). As noted
in section 1.3 above in the absence of specific energy objectives technocratic experts
tended not to be energy experts but generalist economists and statisticians (Inter-
views 2, 5, 11, 21). Energy expertise, as a result, has rested more with private actors
than with government institutions grappling with the task of redesigning them and
there are arguments that this, and high staff turnover, has delayed the identification
and implementation of some sustainable energy policies (Interviews 10, 16 and 22).
One claim is that a focus on economic variables left technocrats for too long blind
to non-economic factors such as human consumption and behaviour or to the need
for energy sources such as renewable energy (Mitchell 2008, 31). It has also been
observed that although `smart meters', designed to help households become more
aware of and efficient in their energy usage, were identified in 2006 as worth
pursuing it took a number of years before energy policymakers even understood a
range of technical elements of smart meters and how they would work in relation
to current energy systems (Interview 22).
Another key to understanding why so little radical energy policy innovation has
taken place is that originally, when first faced with the idea of pursuing climate
change mitigation objectives, UK policymakers had argued that markets would
deliver (Department of the Environment 1990). This faith in markets was to remain
12 CAROLINE KUZEMKO

Kuzemko 119
prominent within energy decision-making processes for some time but was based
on a whole range of uncontested assumptions. For example it was understood that
consumers would `demand' renewable energy and companies would therefore
have to deliver (IEA (International Energy Agency) 1998, 67), competition would
drive renewable energy development (DETR 2000), and freely trading markets
were a prerequisite for the provision of energy supply security (Mitchell et al. 2001,
177). Assumptions about how energy should be governed also for some time
specifically ruled out government decisions about what mix of energy technologies
the UK should have, intervention in markets, or directing energy investments (DTI
2003; see also Mitchell 2008).
Later, in 2003, when energy policy was first allocated energy and climate-specific
objectives these were vaguely worded, replete with get out clauses such as `where
possible' (DTI 2003, 11), and the assumption remained that markets would deliver.
What is important about this assumption is that by accepting climate objectives it
was understood that little would need to change in terms of pro-market energy
policy (Kuzemko 2013, 111), thereby arguably also vastly underestimating the scale
of the problem. Technocrats continued to either remain ignorant of or actively
reject other voices that recommended more profound government involvement
and change (Interviews 2, 10, 11 and 21; see also Scrase and Ockwell 2009, 38).
One interviewee at Ofgem suggested that they designed their review of energy
markets, Project Discovery, to make it look as if they had considered more `radical'
solutions but were always going to choose instruments that had least impact on
freely-trading markets (Interview 11). The lack of ability of DECC and Ofgem staff
to think outside the box, as well as knowledge loss due to staff turnover, has
recently been recognised and some attempts are now under way to open techno-
cratic eyes to alternatives (Civil Service 2012, 10; Interview 21).
However, it began to become apparent, over the course of the mid to late 2000s,
that markets were not delivering on investment in traditional as well as new energy
infrastructure, and technology politicians and technocrats were limited to an expla-
nation of `market failure' (see Miliband 2008; Wicks 2009). What is important
about this neoclassical economics explanation of climate and energy security prob-
lems is that although the appropriate response is government intervention such
interventions have been weak and, by design, temporary. Indeed, it has been
argued that the conceptualisation of energy-related problems as market failure has
in practice limited the response of government to raising the level of market signals
and to some low scale interventions (see Mazzucato 2013, 124­126). For example,
the recent Electricity Market Reform (EMR) is designed both to pay a set price for
clean energy but also to incentivise market players to invest in new (but not
necessarily low carbon) capacity. These incentives and interventions are explicitly
designed to be temporary:
The reforms in the Energy Bill are specifically designed to move us away
from such intervention--and blaze a trail towards competition. That is
their ultimate aim (Davey 2013).
In 2013 the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change stated that once new
energy and climate frameworks have been put in place government intervention
can recede and DECC can be reduced in size (Davey in HC ECC (House of Commons
ENERGY DEPOLITICISATION IN THE UK 13

120 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 18(1)
Energy and Climate Change Committee) 2013). This remains in line with Nigel
Lawson's statement of 1983 that once government frameworks have been put in
place markets should be allowed to function with a minimum of distortion.
Temporary and weak interventions and instruments that seek to incentivise
investment but not disrupt markets are a far cry from suggestions within sustainable
energy policy literatures, such as those put forward by Transitions Management
scholars, that energy transition requires ongoing and sustained government capacity
and support, knowledge building, learning-by-doing and flexibility (Lehtonen and
Kern 2009). One critique is that the UK's sustainable energy policy is patchy, lacking
in vision and small scale, whilst what is needed is the creation of new markets and
new relationships between state and private sector institutions (Mazzucato 2013,
120 and 124­6). The lack of ability to do so is seen as causal in the UK's position as
a laggard in development of clean energy and associated technologies behind other
countries, such as Germany and China, that are becoming the clean technology
leaders of the future (ibid). Conditions of non-deliberation have been shown here to
have restricted UK energy policy-making choices in practice and to have limited
opportunities for knowledge building and learning-by-doing.
Conclusions
It was suggested in the introduction to this article that two contributions would be
made. One has been to offer depoliticisation as a conceptual approach that can help
to explain why UK energy policy has been so limited in its response to significant
new challenges. Taken together the heuristic forms of depoliticisation applied in this
analysis have revealed specific lacks in capacity but also some reasons as to why
there has been ideological lock-in related to what rules and norms became embed-
ded. Various aspects of institutional design, such as hiring and training practices and
the focus on economics over energy, have mattered not least in that they explain a
lack of government energy system knowledge as well as knowledge of the impacts
of energy policy on society. The analysis here also shines a light on the gulf that
currently exists between those that argue for a central and knowledge-building role
for the state in energy transition and the constrained nature of some of the choices
made so far in the UK. By trusting in markets to deliver and by under-investing in
energy institutions and knowledge the UK has to an extent destroyed its own
capacity to deliver transition.
The second contribution is to depoliticisation literatures in terms of arguments
about, and empirical evidence of, the collective impacts of depoliticisations on
political capacities, potentially including the capacity to meet policy objectives. The
evidence here suggests that each form of depoliticisation has been contingent upon,
and reinforced by, economic ideas about the appropriate role for states and markets
in the field of energy. What has also emerged as important to understanding
political capacities has been a consideration of the precise ways in which
depoliticisations were pursued in practice. For example it was not only significant
that marketised depoliticisation by design passed greater responsibility to private
sector actors, but the decision to allow vertical integration also had significant
implications for relative political capacities in terms of knowledge and economic
power.

It has been necessary, when trying to assess the impact on political capacity, to be
clear about how politics is conceptualised here. Politics as capable of deliberation,
choice and of delivering collective goods, such as sustainable energy system tran-
sitions, requires that energy policymaking institutions be redesigned in multiple
ways. Energy as a collective good upon which so many depend remains a highly
political subject and transition unprecedented and replete with risks. This combi-
nation must surely require dedicated forward planning, greater and more consistent
energy knowledge-building within government, less reliance on `big' business to
deliver objectives and more emphasis on supporting and providing information for
UK publics. In order for government to commit to institutions capable of perform-
ing such functions there would need to be some considerable shift in thinking about
the benefits of depoliticisation. By explicitly posing questions about depoliticisation
in practice and by explaining how it has destroyed certain kinds of institutional
capacity this article might assist in such a re-think.

companies--not least in terms of continued reluctance to pass on wholesale price reductions to
consumers. This has resulted in and election promise by Labour to freeze gas and electricity prices.
