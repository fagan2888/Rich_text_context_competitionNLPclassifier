Influenza vaccination rates have varied slightly in recent
years in response to H1N1 and changing recommendations
but are still far below national goals (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2010). Health beliefs strongly influ-
ence whether someone engages in a simple, voluntary health
behavior like obtaining an annual influenza vaccination.
Unfortunately, unvaccinated individuals who would benefit
from the vaccine's protection hold health beliefs that under-
mine efforts to achieve targeted vaccination rates.
It has been estimated that approximately 80% of the U.S.
population are members of a special at-risk group that the
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) rec-
ommends for priority vaccination (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2010). Because the proportion of the
population considered at risk is so large, since 2010, the
ACIP has recommended universal vaccination of everyone 6
months of age and older. However, only 39% of the U.S.
adult population was vaccinated for influenza during 2011-
2012 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012).
Public health has had some success in reaching people who
are most receptive to vaccination. Public health's primary
focus has been on people 65 years of age and older, which is
the group most likely to receive a vaccination. This age group
had a vaccination rate of 66% during 2008-2009. Influenza
vaccination rates for other priority groups were much lower.
Among those with a high-risk condition, such as asthma, only
33% of 18- to 49-year-olds and 51% of 50- to 64-year-olds
were vaccinated in 2008-2009. Also of concern is that, in
2007-2008, less than half (49%) of health care workers, who
can transmit the virus within the health care system, were vac-
cinated (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010).
Although vaccination rates have varied within a narrow
range in the United States over the last few years, rates have
not improved dramatically among any group for more than a
decade. Rather than simply increasing intervention efforts
that have proven to work in the past with receptive individu-
als (Briss et al., 2000), public health must now develop and
adopt new strategies to interest those who are indifferent or
resistant to vaccination efforts. It should not be assumed that
increasing the intensity or reach of recognized best practices
that have worked among the most receptive will be effective
in reaching the less willing and the least receptive.

Underutilization of Influenza Vaccine:
A Test of the Health Belief Model
Marshall K. Cheney1 and Robert John2
Abstract
Yearly influenza vaccination continues to be underutilized by those who would most benefit from it. The Health Belief
Model was used to explain differences in beliefs about influenza vaccination among at-risk individuals resistant to influenza
vaccination. Survey data were collected from 74 members of at-risk groups who were not vaccinated for influenza during the
previous flu season. Accepting individuals were more likely to perceive flu as a threat to health and perceive access barriers,
and cues to action were the most important influence on whether they plan to get vaccinated. In comparison, resistant
individuals did not feel threatened by the flu, access barriers were not a problem, and they did not respond favorably to
cues to action. Perceived threat, perceived access barriers, and cues to action were significantly associated with plans to be
vaccinated for influenza in the next flu season. Participants who saw influenza as a threat to their health had 5.4 times the
odds of planning to be vaccinated than those who did not. Participants reporting barriers to accessing influenza vaccination
had 7.5 times the odds of reporting plans to be vaccinated. Those responding positively to cues to action had 12.2 times
the odds of planning to be vaccinated in the next flu season than those who did not. Accepting and resistant individuals have
significant differences in their beliefs, which require different intervention strategies to increase vaccination rates. These
findings provide important information to researchers and practitioners working to increase influenza vaccination rates.

To increase rates of influenza vaccination, public health
will need to respond with new approaches targeted at beliefs
and perceptions about influenza vaccination. The Health
Belief Model (HBM) can be used to understand beliefs and
perceptions about influenza vaccination and guide the choice
of interventions for people indifferent or resistant to influ-
enza vaccination. According to the HBM, individuals are
more likely to get vaccinated for influenza if they think they
are susceptible to influenza, think influenza is a serious con-
dition, believe influenza vaccination would reduce their sus-
ceptibility to influenza or make influenza symptoms less
severe, do not think the flu shot has excessive personal costs
and the benefits of vaccination outweigh those costs, and are
confident in their ability to obtain a vaccination (Rosenstock,
1966; Rosenstock, Strecher, & Becker, 1988).
Perceived susceptibility is the belief in personal vulnera-
bility to influenza. Previous studies have established that
people who had been vaccinated for influenza were more
likely to see themselves at higher risk for influenza than the
unvaccinated, whereas those who were not vaccinated for
influenza saw themselves as unlikely to contract influenza
(Brewer & Hallman, 2006; Chapman & Coups, 1999; Mayo
& Cobler, 2004; Nowalk, Zimmerman, Shen, Jewell, &
Raymund, 2004; Santibanez et al., 2002; Tabbarah et al.,
2005; Telford & Rogers, 2003; Willis & Wortley, 2007;
Zimmerman, Santibanez, et al., 2003). However, two studies
have shown that individuals resistant to influenza vaccina-
tion are concerned about the susceptibility of vulnerable
family members, and were willing to get vaccinated to pro-
tect the health of someone they cared about (Bardenheier
et al., 2006; John & Cheney, 2008).
Perceived severity refers to an individual's belief about
the seriousness of influenza and its consequences. This
includes physical health and social consequences such as
ability to work and maintain family and social relationships.
According to the HBM, perceived severity is particularly
important when susceptibility beliefs are high. However,
research has shown that perceived severity alone was not a
significant predictor of influenza vaccination (Armstrong,
Berlin, Schwartz, Propert, & Ubel, 2001; Blue & Valley,
2002; Brewer & Hallman, 2006) probably because most peo-
ple, whether vaccinated or unvaccinated, saw it as a serious
illness, particularly for someone their age (Chi & Neuzil,
2004; Lindley, Wortley, Winston, & Bardenheier, 2006).
Perceived threat refers to an individual's joint perceptions
of susceptibility and severity. Beliefs in susceptibility and
severity must be high before influenza is seen as a serious
threat to personal health (Brewer & Rimer, 2008).
Perceived benefit refers to an individual's belief in a range
of potential benefits of obtaining a flu vaccination. One of
the most important benefits is the effectiveness of the vacci-
nation in a given year to reduce the risk or seriousness of
influenza. Several studies have found that perceived effec-
tiveness of the vaccine is one of the most consistent predic-
tors of influenza vaccination (Brewer & Hallman, 2006;
Chapman & Coups, 1999; Prislin, Dyer, Blakely, & Johnson,
1998; Tabbarah et al., 2005).
Perceived barriers are an individual's belief about the
physical and psychological costs of getting vaccinated for
influenza. Those who are resistant to vaccination are more
likely to report experiencing vaccination side effects or get-
ting sick from the influenza vaccination (Armstrong et al.,
2001; Brewer & Hallman, 2006; Chapman & Coups, 1999;
Chi & Neuzil, 2004; Gosney, 2000; John & Cheney, 2008;
Lindley et al., 2006; Mayo & Cobler, 2004; Santibanez et al.,
2002; Tabbarah et al., 2005; Winston, Wortley, & Lees, 2006;
Zimmerman, Santibanez, et al., 2003). Previous research has
also documented knowledge barriers (Gosney, 2000; Lindley
et al., 2006; Ritvo et al., 2003) and a general concern about
the safety of the influenza vaccination (Allison et al., 2010;
Chen et al., 2011; John & Cheney, 2008; Lindley et al., 2006;
Telford & Rogers, 2003; Willis & Wortley, 2007; Wray et al.,
2007). Despite these misgivings, about half (48%) of older
adults who doubted the effectiveness of the vaccine and a
third (37%) of those who thought the vaccine causes illness
would still agree to get a vaccination to protect others
(Bardenheier et al., 2006).
Costs and benefits: Research has shown that, regardless
of vaccination status, people see vaccination as entailing
costs and benefits. Those who were not vaccinated com-
monly acknowledged some benefits to vaccination, but, on
balance, saw more costs than benefits (Bardenheier et al.,
2006; Blue & Valley, 2002; Chi & Neuzil, 2004; Nowalk et
al., 2004; Zimmerman, Santibanez, et al., 2003).
Self-efficacy refers to an individual's confidence in his or
her ability to successfully get vaccinated. Few studies related
to influenza vaccination have looked directly at the role of
self-efficacy, perhaps because vaccination is a simple, time-
limited behavior that does not require lifestyle adjustments
or changes to complex health behaviors such as adhering to
an exercise program or eating a healthier diet (Brewer &
Rimer, 2008; Champion & Skinner, 2008). In the case of
influenza vaccination, self-efficacy does not appear to be an
important determinant of influenza vaccination among adults
(Chapman & Coups, 1999).
Cues to action are environmental prompts to activate an
individual's readiness to seek a vaccination. Considered a
trigger to take action within the HBM, it is the link between
belief and behavior. Health care provider recommendation
has been associated with higher rates of influenza vaccina-
tion (Allison et al., 2010; Armstrong et al., 2001; Chen et al.,
2011; Mayo & Cobler, 2004; Winston et al., 2006) primarily
for those who are more accepting (Bardenheier et al., 2006;
Chi & Neuzil, 2004; Nowalk et al., 2004; Winston et al.,
2006). Even for those who were resistant to influenza vacci-
nation, a provider recommendation made vaccination more
likely (Bardenheier et al., 2006; Chi & Neuzil, 2004; Lindley
et al., 2006; Wray et al., 2007).
Family members are considered another source of an
effective cue to action (Nowalk et al., 2004; Zimmerman,
Cheney and John 3
Nowalk, et al., 2003; Zimmerman, Santibanez, et al., 2003)
although not all studies found them to be influential (Mayo
& Cobler, 2004). A belief that influenza vaccination is the
social norm (Allison et al., 2010; Chapman & Coups, 1999)
was also found to be an effective cue to action.
Existing research provides relevant information about
vaccine acceptance. However, it does not help as much if we
wish to understand what influences the behavior of the
unvaccinated. There is little information available about
individuals resistant to influenza vaccination. The objectives
for this study were to utilize the HBM as a framework for
understanding beliefs surrounding indifference or resistance
to influenza vaccination and to identify intervention points
and messaging strategies to increase future vaccination rates
among the unvaccinated.
Method
This formative research was based on survey data collected
during eight focus group discussions with 74 individuals
from Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, that were conducted
between March and June 2007. The purpose of the focus
group discussions was to understand individual attitudes,
behaviors, and concerns about influenza vaccination and
how practitioners can improve influenza vaccination rates
among resistant individuals. Results of the focus group dis-
cussions are reported elsewhere (John & Cheney, 2008). The
focus of the present study is on the questionnaires that were
administered to the focus group participants.
Participants were eligible to participate in the study if
they were a member of a population group whose influenza
vaccination rates were lower than the general population
and/or were members of identifiable high-risk groups
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010), includ-
ing ethnic minority, low socioeconomic status, and chroni-
cally ill adults. Additional inclusion criteria were age above
30 and to not have received an influenza vaccination during
the 2006-2007 flu season.
A purposive sampling strategy was used to recruit indi-
viduals in high-risk groups who had not received an influ-
enza vaccination in the past year. Participant recruitment
information was distributed through a wide variety of com-
munity sources to increase representativeness of the sample,
including local businesses, community centers, local clinics,
distribution lists from local community coalitions and ser-
vice organizations, libraries, and grocery stores. A signed
informed consent was obtained from each person before par-
ticipation in the study and each participant received a US$30
store gift card at the end of the session.
Every participant filled out two questionnaires, one at the
beginning of the focus group discussion and the second fol-
lowing the discussion. Each questionnaire took approxi-
mately 10 min to complete. The first questionnaire contained
questions about basic demographic information and social
characteristics, past and anticipated flu vaccination behavior,
health status and conditions, and work or caregiving respon-
sibilities that would place them in contact with vulnerable
groups (chronically ill, children, or elderly).
The second questionnaire collected health belief informa-
tion about influenza vaccination that is important in under-
standing what influences and issues may be important in
getting reluctant individuals to get a flu shot. The 45 ques-
tions in this questionnaire were based on previous research
of influenza vaccination assessed in adult populations
(Bardenheier et al., 2006; Chi & Neuzil, 2004; Hebert, Frick,
Kane, & McBean, 2005; Nowalk et al., 2004; Prislin et al.,
1998; Zimmerman, Santibanez, et al., 2003). Each of the sur-
veys except Prislin et al. (1998) was developed for adults 65
years of age or older. The Prislin et al. questionnaire was
developed for adults who had a child aged 2 to 24 months
living at their home.
To test the HBM, the analysis incorporated variables that
specified the main constructs of the model: perceived sus-
ceptibility (1 variable), perceived severity (3 variables), per-
ceived benefits (9 variables), perceived barriers (23
variables), and cues to action (4 variables). Although self-
efficacy is now routinely added to the HBM, it is not needed
to understand simple health behaviors like obtaining an
influenza vaccination (Brewer & Rimer, 2008; Champion &
Skinner, 2008).
Because of the large number of independent variables
used to specify the HBM constructs, factor and/or reliability
analyses were conducted on the perceived benefits, per-
ceived barriers, and cues to action variables. For each of the
constructs with a large number of variables (perceived ben-
efits and perceived barriers), a principal axis factor proce-
dure with varimax rotation was run to identify latent variables
and reduce the number of independent variables that would
be used in the multivariate logistic regression analysis.
Because the number of cases with missing values was small,
missing values were replaced with the mean. After the fac-
tors were identified, a reliability analysis was conducted on
the perceived benefits and barriers subscales. All data analy-
sis was conducted using SPSS 19 (IBM, 2010).
Perceived Benefits Scale
A principal axis factor procedure with varimax rotation was
run using the nine perceived benefits. The final solution
resulted in a factor that contained the following five vari-
ables: "I am willing to get a flu shot if I were sure it pre-
vented the flu," "I would get the flu shot to stay healthy,"
"Getting a flu shot is a wise thing to do," "I would get a flu
shot to prevent spreading the disease to people close to me,"
and "I would rather have a flu shot than get the flu." Analysis
established that the measure of sampling adequacy was very
good (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin [KMO] = .86) and the model
fit the data well. Reponses were summed across the five
4 SAGE Open
variables to create a perceived benefits scale. The scale was
additive and highly reliable (Cronbach's  = .90).
Perceived Barriers Scales
A principal axis factor procedure with varimax rotation was
run using the 23 perceived barriers. The final solution
resulted in four factors and analysis established that the mea-
sure of sampling adequacy was adequate (KMO = .79) and
the model fit the data well. The first factor, which we labeled
Access Barriers was composed of "Doctors or clinics that
give the flu shot are hard to reach," "Doctors/clinics that give
the flu shot are not open when I can get there," and "It is dif-
ficult for me to find the time to get a flu shot." This three-
item scale had very good reliability (Cronbach's  = .84).
The second barriers scale, Perceived Harm, was composed of
"The flu shot causes a person to get the flu," "Serious side
effects from the flu shot are common," and "I worry about
side effects from the flu shot." This three-item scale had ade-
quate reliability (Cronbach's  = .74). The third perceived
barriers scale was composed of three variables: "I wonder
about the safety of the flu vaccine," "Flu shots are unneces-
sary," and "Healthy people do not need to get a flu shot." We
labeled this scale Belief Barriers. This three-item scale had
marginally adequate reliability (Cronbach's  = .69). The
final perceived barriers scale was composed of "I do not trust
a doctor's advice to get a flu shot," "Getting a flu shot is
more trouble than it is worth," and "I do not like the way doc-
tors and clinic staff that give the flu shot treat me." This
three-item scale, which we labeled Mistrust, also had mar-
ginally adequate reliability (Cronbach's  = .66).
Cues to Action
Four variables were use to construct a cues to action scale: "I
would get a flu shot if my doctor or nurse recommended it,"
"I would get a flu shot if my family wanted me to," "News of
a bad flu season would influence me to get the flu shot," and
"I am willing to get both pneumonia and flu vaccines at the
same time if my doctor recommends it." None of these vari-
ables contained missing values. This four item scale had
excellent reliability (Cronbach's  = .88).
To identify significant independent variables that were
not included in one of the benefits or barriers subscales,
bivariate correlations were calculated to determine whether
any of the variables that were not included in one of the
scales was associated with the two dependent variables
(whether the respondent plans to get a flu shot next year and
whether they never ask their doctor or nurse for the flu shot).
This resulted in the identification of an additional benefit
variable and two barrier variables that were included in the
logistic regression analysis. The relatively small sample size
placed constraints on the logistic regression analysis.
Therefore, all the independent variables used in the analysis
were dichotomized at the median.
Results
Characteristics of Focus Group Participants
As seen in Table 1, participants ranged in age from 30 to 75
years, with a mean age of 49.3 years. Two thirds of the par-
ticipants (66.2%) were women. More than two thirds of the
participants were non-Hispanic White (36.5%) or African
American (35.1%).
Participants tended to be highly educated with approxi-
mately one third having obtained a college degree (16.2%), a
graduate or professional degree (16.2%), or some college
(33.8%).
Table 2 documents the self-reported health status, behav-
iors, and resources of the participants. The vast majority of
participants were in good or excellent self-rated health,
63.5% and 16.2%, respectively. Participants tended to
appraise their health as about the same (41.9%) or better
(44.6%) and only 13.5% as worse than others their age.
Among the participants, 73% said they have a usual place of
health care.
None of the participants got an influenza vaccination dur-
ing 2006-2007. However, 30.6% said they planned to get an
influenza vaccination next year. This information was col-
lected before the focus group discussion began, so the
response was not influenced by the information or opinions
expressed by the group.
HBM
Table 3 shows the level of agreement of participants who
were accepting and resistant to influenza vaccination for
each of the major constructs of the HBM.
Perceived susceptibility.Table 3 documents that resistant
individuals did not believe they were susceptible to the flu.
Whereas 74% of resistant individuals agreed with "I don't
think I'm likely to get the flu," only 38% of accepting indi-
viduals agreed.
Perceived severity. Three items assessed beliefs in the sever-
ity of influenza for self and vulnerable others. Many resistant
individuals did not perceive influenza as a serious illness for
someone their age. Participants were somewhat more likely
to perceive influenza as a serious illness for children, and
there was general agreement that influenza is a serious illness
for the elderly. However, the intensity of these beliefs differed
between resistant and accepting individuals. Responses to "I
don't think I am likely to get the flu" (perceived susceptibil-
ity) were reverse coded and multiplied by "Flu is a serious
illness for someone my age" (perceived severity) to create a
perceived threat variable (Champion & Skinner, 2008).
Perceived benefit.Nine items measured beliefs about the
benefits of influenza vaccination. Accepting individuals
were far more likely than resistant individuals to strongly
Cheney and John 5
endorse each of the five items in the perceived benefits scale.
Differences between groups in the other four items were less
pronounced, but resistant individuals were less likely to
favorably perceive the endorsement of vaccination by health
care personnel or relatives and friends, were less sure that the
vaccine does not cause the flu, and did not believe that flu
shots prevent the flu.
Perceived barriers.The 23 perceived barriers comprised
the largest number of independent variables. Table 3 reveals
that accepting individuals were more likely to perceive
access barriers to vaccination than resistant individuals. In
contrast, resistant individuals were more likely to endorse
the issues that comprise the Perceived Harm, Belief, and
Mistrust barriers.
Cues to action.As seen in Table 3, accepting individuals
were more likely to respond favorably to each of the cues to
action. What is clear from these results is that family mem-
bers were not a significant influence on resistant individual's
vaccination behavior and apparently were less influential
than recommendation by a physician, especially among the
most intensely resistant.
Logistic regression analysis.Tables 4 and 5 document the
results of the logistic regression analysis using the HBM
constructs to predict whether an individual plans to get a flu
shot next year and whether they would ask a doctor or nurse
for a flu shot. In the unadjusted model for plans to get a flu
shot next year (Table 4), all the main HBM constructs were
significant. This is what would be predicted by the HBM and
confirms a general finding in the literature. Three barriers,
access to vaccination, belief that the vaccination will cause
harm, and negative beliefs about flu vaccination were sig-
nificantly associated with plans to be vaccinated for influ-
enza in the next flu season. Perceived barriers associated

with mistrust of medical providers and the vaccine were not
significantly associated with plans to be vaccinated next
year.
All variables in the first panel were tested for inclusion in
the final multivariate model using the forward stepwise
method based on the likelihood ratio, which is recommended
as the best method for this purpose (IBM, 2010). In the
adjusted model, only perceived threat, perceived access bar-
riers, and cues to action were significantly associated with
plans to be vaccinated for influenza in the next flu season.
People who saw influenza as a threat to their health had 5.4
times the odds of planning to be vaccinated than those who
did not see influenza as a threat to health. Those who reported
barriers to accessing influenza vaccination had 7.5 times the
Cheney and John 9
odds of reporting plans to be vaccinated, documenting that
accepting individuals perceive barriers to obtaining vaccina-
tion while resistant individuals do not. Finally, those who
responded positively to cues to action had 12.2 times the
odds of planning to be vaccinated in the next flu season than
those who did not respond positively to the cues.
Based on the final model, accepting individuals were
more likely to perceive flu as a threat to health (perceive they
were susceptible and that flu is a serious illness), access bar-
riers were a problem that negatively influences their vaccina-
tion behavior, and cues to action were the most important
influence on whether they plan to get vaccinated. In com-
parison, resistant individuals did not feel threatened by the
flu, access barriers were not a problem because they were not
trying to get vaccinated, and they did not respond favorably
to cues to action from any source.
A discriminant analysis was run to determine how well
the final model predicted group membership. The discrimi-
nant analysis confirmed that these three variables discrimi-
nated well between the two groups. The canonical correlation
was .64 and 83.3% of cases were correctly classified using
the cross-validation procedure in SPSS. In contrast to a pre-
vious study (Blue & Valley, 2002), this model was better at
predicting group membership especially among resistant
individuals (84%) compared with accepting individuals
(82%).
In the first panel of Table 5, the unadjusted model reveals
that each of the main HBM constructs was significantly
related to asks doctor or nurse for a flu shot. Only Access and
Mistrust barriers were not significant. However, once all the
influences of the HBM constructs were taken into consider-
ation using the same procedure as the previous analysis, only
cues to action were independently related to asking for a
flu shot.
Discussion
This study reveals that accepting and resistant individuals
have significant, determinant differences in their health
beliefs about influenza vaccination. These differences begin
with diametrically opposed views of their susceptibility to
the illness and the severity of influenza as a personal health
problem. Furthermore, these divergent health beliefs extend
to opposing views of the benefits of obtaining a flu vaccina-
tion, with accepting individuals subscribing to much more
favorable opinions of the vaccine. More differences are evi-
dent when barriers are considered. Access is only a problem
for those who intend to obtain a flu shot, so improving access
will not matter for resistant individuals. Accepting individu-
als perceive access barriers while resistant individuals do
not. In comparison, resistant individuals perceive harm, have
negative health beliefs about the vaccine, and are somewhat
more mistrustful of medical care. Finally, cues to action posi-
tively influence accepting individuals while resistant indi-
viduals ignore or actively dismiss these messages.
These results have profound implications for the prospect
of improving influenza vaccination rates in the United States.
Our results show that more of the recommended interven-
tions or more intense or improved techniques that support
these interventions will only succeed in marginal improve-
ments in the influenza vaccination rates and will continue to
fall well short of targeted vaccination goals advanced in
Healthy People 2020.
Although more research is needed to gain an in-depth
understanding of the population that is unresponsive or
avoids annual vaccination, this research has established that
it is a distinctly different population than the one that has
been reached successfully so far. This research suggests that
the pivotal issues that need to be addressed are within the
Perceived Benefits and Perceived Barriers parts of the HBM.
Cues to action will not have any influence unless basic per-
ceptions are modified to shift neutral or negative beliefs in a
more positive direction. Our research has shown that it is
only among receptive individuals that these social influences
are successful. Moreover, we do not believe that a direct fear
appeal will be effective in changing perceived threat which
the HBM considers essential because resistant individuals do
not believe influenza is a threat to their personal health.

Resistant individuals will not obtain a seasonal influenza
vaccination to protect their health and any attempt to appeal
to their sense of personal vulnerability will not succeed.
Other evidence suggests that resistant individuals are con-
cerned about the health of elderly relatives and children and
an appeal to their altruism is more likely to succeed (John &
Cheney, 2008). In this case, health provider recommendation
may be more effective if the cue to action is to reduce the
threat to significant others rather than themselves.
Additional Strategies to Increase Influenza
Vaccination
The HBM focuses on the individual and their self-regarding
behaviors, but individual behavior change is difficult to initi-
ate and sustain without acknowledging and changing the sur-
rounding social environment. Future studies could examine
the effectiveness of interventions structured around the
Ecological Model (McLeroy, Bibeau, Steckler, & Glanz,
1988), targeting family and social networks, organizations,
community, and policy, to increase vaccination rates in this
population. Asking resistant individuals to accompany fam-
ily members to be vaccinated to ensure they received their
vaccination, then being vaccinated themselves to increase
the protection for vulnerable family members is one strategy
to increase vaccination rates. Asking businesses and commu-
nity organizations to vaccinate their employees during work
hours would help accepting individuals overcome access
barriers. In addition, working with health insurance compa-
nies to waive the co-pay for influenza vaccination or to
expand coverage to more providers during vaccination sea-
son to allow accepting individuals more flexibility in time
and place to be vaccinated may also help to increase rates.
These ideas address access issues and are unlikely to alter the
behavior of indifferent or resistant individuals. Resistant
individuals need better knowledge about the vaccine that dis-
pels misperceptions and fears, and messaging touting the
benefits of being vaccinated to protect the health of signifi-
cant others (especially the elderly and children).
HBM Limitations
These results document that the HBM is a useful framework
for understanding differences between those individuals who
are accepting and resistant to influenza vaccination, but it
has limitations. Research has shown that past vaccination
behavior is one of the strongest predictors of future influenza
vaccination (Armstrong et al., 2001; Brewer & Hallman,
2006; Chapman & Coups, 1999; Chi & Neuzil, 2004; Mayo
& Cobler, 2004; Xakellis, 2005), but past behavior is not
explicitly incorporated into the HBM. Chapman and Coups
(1999) suggested the influence of past behavior is partly
accounted for by perceived effectiveness of the vaccine,
along with the likelihood of side effects, so that individuals
would be more likely to be vaccinated if their previous expe-
rience suggested that the vaccine was effective in preventing
influenza and caused no or few side effects. In the absence of
a positive personal experience with the flu shot, beliefs
regarding the flu shot (whether well-founded or nonrational)
will be the primary determinant of behavior.
To determine the influence of past experience on intent to
obtain a flu shot, the sample was divided into three groups:
those who never had a flu shot and did not intend to get one
next year (the Never/Nots), individuals who ever received a
flu shot and did not intend to get a flu shot the next year (the
Ever/Nots), and individuals who had received a flu shot
before and intended to get one next year (Accepting). A
series of cross-tabulations of group by HBM variable
revealed that the biggest differences are between the Never/
Nots and the Accepting group. This analysis revealed that
individuals in the Accepting group are true believers in the
flu shot. They have few doubts about the merits of being vac-
cinated. The Never/Not group is the mirror image of the true
believers, exhibiting a substantial negative consensus about
the problems with flu vaccination. In general, the Ever/Not
group is intermediate with mixed perceptions of the flu shot,
but more like the Never/Nots than Accepting individuals.
From the standpoint of the HBM, the individuals who are
most resistant to influenza vaccination have no personal
experience on which they base their perceptions.
Another deficiency of the HBM is that it assumes that
health behaviors are the result of concern for one's own
health. However, this research provides additional evidence
that this is a weak motivation for indifferent or resistant indi-
viduals who appear to be more willing to be vaccinated in
response to the health threat to vulnerable others (John &
Cheney, 2008). Engaging in a health behavior based on altru-
istic beliefs of a health threat to others is not adequately
accounted for in the model. For this particular health behav-
ior, an altruistic appeal to protect the health of significant
others may be the only appeal that will make a difference to
resistant individuals.
The HBM represents health beliefs as static and research
using the HBM is overwhelmingly cross-sectional, looking
at health beliefs at one point in time. Our research is consis-
tent with this approach. However, we do not have an indica-
tion of how stable these beliefs are over time, taking into
account vaccine effectiveness from year to year, the increas-
ing age of the individual, and increasing media coverage of
influenza outbreaks such as H1N1. On the other hand, for
many individuals, strongly held beliefs are difficult to
change. No research has established the extent to which
beliefs about influenza vaccination can be modified for
resistant individuals. If they are difficult to change, the
HBM loses some of its utility and is not as useful as an
alternate model such as Social Marketing, which has a pri-
mary focus on changing behaviors based on precisely tar-
geted appeals to specific audience segments that have
Cheney and John 11
different beliefs and attitudes toward the health behavior. In
a sense, this research confirms the existence of distinct
audience segments with different psychographics toward
the behavior.
Study Limitations
As an exploratory research project based on a purposive
sampling strategy, the primary limitation of this study is the
small sample size. Every precaution was taken to minimize
this problem, including data reduction, analysis of measures
of sampling adequacy, using binary variables, and limiting
the number of independent variables in the multivariate
logistic regression models. However, a larger sample size
would have improved the data reduction process and
strengthened the formation of the HBM scales and the multi-
variate logistic regression results.
A potential secondary limitation is that the sample was
not a random sample and the results may not be generaliz-
able to the population of individuals who are indifferent or
resistant to seasonal influenza vaccination. This limitation
was intentional and unavoidable because few studies have
sought to understand the health beliefs of the majority of
Americans who fail to get a seasonal influenza vaccination
on a regular basis. The indifferent or resistant population is
the population that needs to be the subject of influenza vac-
cination research.
Another potential limitation raised by one reviewer is
the questionnaire's placement after the focus group discus-
sion. Although it is possible that the focus group discussion
influenced questionnaire responses, the influence should
have been minimal or beneficial for our purpose. Focus
group discussions are meant to allow participants to fully
consider their views and compare them with the views of
others on a particular topic and then be able to offer an
informed opinion in contrast to the instantaneous, top-of-
the-mind initial reaction required by most survey research.
If anything, the focus group discussion helped participants
develop a refined opinion about their beliefs and attitudes
toward influenza vaccination.
Conclusion
Accepting and resistant individuals have significantly dif-
ferent beliefs toward influenza vaccination that require dif-
ferent intervention strategies to increase vaccination rates.
This research provides important information to research-
ers and practitioners by focusing interventions on different
constructs of the HBM to increase influenza vaccination.
Accepting individuals need better access, fewer barriers,
more effective cues to action, and messages that heighten
their sense of personal susceptibility. Although necessary,
these features of an influenza vaccination intervention will
only result in marginal improvements in vaccination rates
because these features are not seen as important by
indifferent and resistant individuals. Resistant individuals
need to be convinced that there is a reason for them to prac-
tice a behavior that they do not view favorably or for which
they do not see a need because they do not view influenza
as a threat to their health. To increase vaccination among
resistant individuals, this research suggests the need to
address a number of health beliefs such as worry about side
effects and healthy people do not need a flu shot, and to
expand the HBM to include health behaviors done for altru-
istic motives to protect the health of vulnerable loved ones.
In this case, the latter concern would not require resistant
individuals to change their beliefs about the vaccine, but
still practice the behavior.
