Abstract
The term geometrical­optical illusions was coined by Johann Joseph Oppel (1815­1894) in 1855 in
order to distinguish spatial distortions of size and orientation from the broader illusions of the
senses. We present a translation of Oppel's article and a commentary on the material described in
it. Oppel did much more than give a name to a class of visual spatial distortions. He examined a
variety of figures and phenomena that were precursors of later, named illusions, and attempted to
quantify and interpret them.

Introduction
Visual illusions have been examined for many centuries and continue to be a source of
experimental and theoretical investigations (see Shapiro & Todorovic
´ , 2017). Great strides
were made from the mid-19th century after Johann Joseph Oppel (1815­1894; Figure 1)
defined a subset of spatial illusions that he referred to as geometrical­optical illusions.
The contents of the initial article by Oppel (1855) on illusions have been described by
several researchers recently (Phillips & Wade, 2014; Todorovic
´ , 2017; Vicario, 2011;
Westheimer, 2008). As Westheimer (2008) remarked, Oppel's seminal paper on illusions

translation appears timely.
Oppel (1855) described and displayed various illusions of orientation and size.
These included line distortions due to intersecting angles as well as juxtaposed arcs, size
distortions as a consequence of line intersections in triangles, rectangles, and circles, as
well as the influence of curved figures on size judgments. Two supplementary articles on
illusions were published by him (Oppel, 1857, 1861). The first concerned bisection errors,
including effects later characterized as the Thie
´ ry-Wundt illusion and the second was
addressed to the differences in estimating filled and unfilled extents, now referred to as the
Oppel-Kundt illusion. Oppel was an ardent observer of nature and his papers often take their
starting point from observations made while walking in the countryside either around
Frankfurt or further afield. For example, he observed the motion aftereffect during a trip
to the Rheinfall at Schaffhausen (Oppel, 1856); initially he considered that he had discovered
the phenomenon, but later deferred to the earlier work on the phenomenon by Plateau,
Purkinje, and Mu
¨ ller (Oppel, 1860).
Life and Work
Brief details of Oppel's life and a summary survey of his academic work are given in
Phillips and Wade (2014). Most of what we can add about his early career chronology is
based on a two-paragraph biographical note by Oppel himself in the yearbook of the
Frankfurt Gymnasium from autumn 1848; a copy is among the Oppel papers in the
Frankfurt town archives (Frankfurt Institut fu
¨ r Stadtgeschichte, Personengeschichte, S2;
2.883).
Johann Joseph Oppel was born in Frankfurt am Main on June 23, 1815. He attended the
Weissfrauenschule and the Katharinenschule to be educated as a merchant. His aptitude in

mathematics resulted in his transfer to the Gymnasium and he qualified for university
entrance in 1833. Between 1834 and 1838, he attended the universities of Giessen and
Leipzig where he enroled to study theology and philology. However, he took every
opportunity to develop his boyhood enthusiasm for science and mathematics by attending
scientific lectures, including some by Moritz Wilhelm Drobisch and Justus von Liebig. Oppel
himself later gave popular lectures on astronomy in the Senckenburg Lecture Hall in
Frankfurt (Kramer, 1967). He was awarded a Doctorate in Philosophy, Philology, and
Mathematics in 1838. Contrary to what was stated in Phillips and Wade (2014), on
returning to Frankfurt, Oppel did not immediately return to his old school, the Frankfurt
Gymnasium. He taught physics, maths, and Latin at various institutions as well as to private
pupils. From 1839 to 1841, he was in Milan as a private tutor for John Frederick Mylius
(Spingardi, 2006), a member of the influential Mylius banking and commercial family. From
1842, he resumed private and school tuition in Frankfurt and in 1845, he was appointed an
assistant for mathematics and physics instruction in the Gymnasium, becoming a fully
established teacher there in 1848 and a full professor in 1859 (Klotzer, 1996). He married
Amalie Fritz in 1855 and they had three daughters and a son. Oppel's sudden retirement in
1878 was a consequence of a severe eye complaint and he died on April 27, 1894.
Despite his significance in the study of illusions, Oppel is not generally known for his
science but is celebrated in Frankfurt for his study of the Frankfurt dialect, the Frankfurter
Idiotikon, which formed the basis for the later, definitive 18 volume Frankfurter Wo¨rterbuch
(Rauh & Schanze, 1971­1985). He also contributed papers to the Frankfurt literary journal
Diaskalia. Even the Frankfurt biographical dictionary entry for Oppel (Klotzer, 1996) makes
no mention of his scientific work. His papers cover a range of subjects in perception and
physics (see Phillips & Wade, 2014).
Oppel was aware of the apparent distortions that accompany many of the simple figures
used in teaching geometry. This seems to have been the starting point for his journey into
geometrical­optical illusions.
Geometrical­Optical Illusions
Prior to Oppel's (1855) article, research on visual illusions tended to be directed to those that
occur in the natural environment like the changing apparent size of the moon during its
transit, its apparent motion when clouds pass in front of it, the apparent motion of rocks
after viewing descending water, and the visibility of afterimages following intense
stimulation; spatial illusions tended to be associated with ambiguous figures like those in
Roman mosaics (see Wade, 2016, 2017). All this was to change with the move into the
laboratory in the early 19th century; this was heralded by the invention of instruments
(like the stereoscope and stroboscopic disc) that afforded more stimulus control (Wade &
Heller, 1997). Two-dimensional (drawn) stimuli were then enlisted to study stereoscopic
vision and motion perception and their application to spatial distortions followed soon
after. Before Oppel's article was published, Fick (1851) described the horizontal­vertical
illusion, and this was discussed at some length by Oppel (but without citing Fick). A
torrent of slightly different illusions appeared in the remaining decades of the 19th
century, many of which bear the names of those who published accounts of them: Zo
¨ llner,
Poggendorff, Hering, Kundt, Delboeuf, Mach, Helmholtz, Hermann, von Bezold, Mu
¨ ller-
Lyer, Lipps, Thie
´ ry, Wundt, Mu
¨ nsterberg, Ebbinghaus, and Titchener. Others were added in
the 20th century and yet more variations have been introduced with the aid of computer
graphics (see Shapiro & Todorovic
´ , 2017).

Oppel is not the easiest of writers to translate, and we have tried to be faithful to his text.
It should be noted that the first illustration in his article is numbered Fig. 2; this is
because the figures were presented on Plates at the end of the journal together with
figures from other articles and they were numbered consecutively. The figures were not
accompanied by legends and so we have placed them close to the text in which they are
described.
On Geometrical­Optical Illusions--By Dr. Phil. J. J. Oppel
A quite peculiar class of ``optical illusions'' relates to those by which the eye--or more
precisely, as with all so-called sensory illusions, actually the unconscious judgment of the
mind--is in error relative to the dimensions or directions of linear and angular sizes, and
therefore they can be appropriately termed geometrical­optical illusions. They are rather
sharply differentiated from those that one usually considers to be optical illusions in that
for them the reciprocal relations of apparent size (visual angle), actual size, and distance of
the seen object have absolutely no relevance, while for the usual so-called optical illusions, it is
precisely the dependence relations of these three factors that play the main role. If, as is
usually the case in the theory of seeing, we call ``visual estimation'' in the special sense that
ability or competence to infer the third one from any two of those three mutually dependent
quantities, insofar as the necessary operation of the understanding does not reach
consciousness, then an optical illusion (in the ordinary meaning of this expression) is
indeed always a misdirection of visual estimation, which, by assuming the value of one of
the two given magnitudes as too high or too small, judges the third, the missing one, wrongly.
One thinks, for example, of the apparent magnitude of the rising moon compared with it high
in the sky; and also the effects in decorative painting.
In the case of the ``geometrical­optical'' illusions, the distance of the object, and therefore
also the angle of vision, as far as it changes with it, has no influence whatsoever, as the
following examples illustrate. Several to my knowledge have not been drawn into the field of
optical examinations.
To begin with a more familiar case, which is easy to observe, and is often demonstrated by
teachers of geometry: vertical dimensions appear to be greater than corresponding horizontal
ones. Thus, a right-angled rectangle of 800 height on a 8½00 base line is readily recognized by
the most careful observer as a square, while a real square, placed beside it, appears a little ½00
too high. If students draw by free hand a square on the blackboard, it will appear to the naive
observer almost without exception to be too wide (relative to the height). It is just as difficult
to make a simple ratio of 1 to 2 in the case of drawing an oblong, and the error is almost
always made in the direction of the horizontal dimension (whether it be the larger or the
smaller).
The same illusion is manifested in the construction of angles and triangles. An angle of 93
is drawn on a black tablet so that its line of division would run in the vertical direction, and
the eye of the naive observer will readily recognize it as a right angle; if the tablet is now
turned by a quarter, so that the opening of the angle to the right or to the left, that is, the
(imaginary) half-line lies horizontally, the angle immediately appears obtuse. On the other
hand, with an angle of about 87, in the last described position, it is regarded as a right angle,
while, after the rotation of the drawing, a quarter-turn is immediately recognized as an acute
angle. Conversely, if an isosceles right-angled triangle with a horizontal base is required, the
majority of the pupils will draw an obtuse-angled triangle, and if the base is to be vertical,
then they will draw an acute triangle.
4 i-Perception
Likewise, an ellipse which is cut out of white paper and placed on a black ground, the axes
of which are 17:18, or even 11:12, is recognized as a circle by naive observers when the longer
axes are horizontal, but as soon as the figure is rotated by 90, it appears elliptical. If, on the
other hand, the diameter of a cylinder (such as a glass) standing on a table is to be estimated
by eye, such that, for example, the vertical distance between the thumb and the index finger
indicates its height above the surface of the table once it is turned (into the horizontal
orientation), then when it is actually turned, it turns out that it was judged as too small.
The counter-experiment (with the original cylinder and the diameter to be indicated in the
horizontal direction) is easy to make.
The fact that even an oblique line is still easily seen as longer than a horizontal one is the
result of the difficulty of correctly drawing an equilateral triangle with a horizontal base on a
vertical surface: the nai¨ve observer here too makes the base line slightly too long, but the
error is recognized immediately when the surface is turned so far that one of its other sides is
now horizontal.
The explanation of all these illusions is undoubtedly due to the fact that the eye, by
virtue of its normal position with regard to the external world, especially relative to the
surface of the earth, is accustomed to see much greater dimensions in the horizontal than
in the vertical direction, and because of this slightly overestimates vertical extents
compared with horizontal. It is precisely because of this that the apparent exception
which the human body sometimes makes from the above rule can be understood; as a
person lying flat on the ground appears to most observers longer than when he is in an
upright position--(this is because the eye is especially accustomed to see the human figure
far more frequently in an upright position, that is, much larger in its vertical than its
horizontal dimensions.)--except if here, which also sounds plausible, the visual angle, or
rather the angle of incidence of the lines of sight with the principal direction of the body
exerts an influence, that is, if in the upright position the perspective foreshortening plays a
greater role.1
The fact that the latter can indeed give rise to some striking illusions is proved by a well-
known experiment with a hat and so forth. (Let a person, unaware of the expected result, be
allowed to look at an ordinary man's cylindrical hat, and then on any wall of the room
indicate the height to which the hat, placed on the ground, would appear. The error is, as a
rule, so obvious that it excites the astonishment of anyone who has seen it.)
To be sure, in all the experiments mentioned, the results will only be as stated as follows: if
the draftsman or observer is really naive, that is, he is not alerted in advance about the
direction in which the eye is usually in error since otherwise the conscious effort to prevent
the error, will succeed either to avoid it or even to commit the opposite error; this remark, of
course, applies to all the following observations.
A second set of these geometrical­optical illusions refers to the relative directions of
lines, and in which the horizontal or vertical position does not seem to have an influence.
First of all, two observations are worth mentioning, which I owe to the kind
communication from Dr. Poppe (Head Teacher at the College of Trade). If a straight
line is drawn outside a circle so that it almost touches it, the straight line appears to the
naive eye of many observers weakly bent or bowed near the circle, with a convexity
toward the circle; the line is thus attracted by the circle, so to speak. Whether the
straight line is vertical, or horizontal, or oblique makes no or little difference
(inasmuch as the result appears to me to be somewhat more marked when the position
is oblique.). If an obtuse angle (at least 135) (in the manner of Fig. 2) is cut near its apex
by a straight line, such that the line would be perpendicular to its (imaginary) bisector,
the line appears weakly bent or bowed in the middle, that is, it appears an obtuse angle,
Wade et al. 5
the opening of which is opposite to the actual obtuse angle.
Still more striking is the illusion, when two of the angles described are opposed as in Fig. 3,
and they are intersected by two parallel lines: The latter appears distinctly further from each
other in their center than on both ends. And here too, the vertical, or horizontal, or oblique
position of the figure makes no difference to the occurrence of the described result (though
perhaps not quite for its magnitude). It is interesting to note, however, that the counter-
experiment shown in Fig. 4, in which the obtuse angle acb (of 135), is intersected by a
different, larger angle mnr (of about 177), which latter is near to uvw and is equal and
parallel to it: then this third angle uvw appears clearly as an angle (i.e., as a bent line at v), but
the second (mnr) appears as a straight line.
It is not the case, as might be supposed at first sight, that irradiation plays a role in all
these observations. I conclude this from the fact that the same results are obtained when the
figures are black on white, or white on a black ground. Only, with regard to the size of the
angles in question, there seems to be a small degree of variation between the eyes of different
observers, since one eye shows a greater, the other a lower sensitivity in the estimation of such
directional differences.
Still more striking is the result of the first-mentioned experiment (with the straight line
and the circle): If, instead of one, two straight lines and instead of the whole circle only
6 i-Perception
arcs of approximately the same linear length and of about 120 are used, as indicated in
Fig. 5.
The parallel lines then appear (for any position of the figure) to be distinctly farther apart
from each other in the vicinity of the circular arcs than at each end; whereas in the counter-
demonstration, Fig. 6, the two middle lines can be fairly strongly bent.
That is, they may be closer together in the middle, without the eye ceasing to maintain
them as parallel (both of them form obtuse angles of about 177). Here too, the results are the
same with black lines on white, as with white on black.
Explaining the illusions under discussion is not entirely easy. That physiological processes
might be in play is not probable to me. Rather, I might suggest as a proposal, perhaps
sufficient, that the eye judges directions (as well as movements) of lines, only through
comparisons, and so in general assesses differences in orientation (that is to say angles) as
Wade et al. 7
larger wherever judgment of the difference in question is made easier, thanks to closeness of
the deviating direction. In this way, for example, in Fig. 4, the difference in orientation
between ac and mn (on account of the simultaneous proximity of both lines to the centre
of vision) appears greater than the difference between ac and uv, from which comparison, a
small (apparent) difference in orientation of mn and uv must result, so that mn is, as it were,
moved into alignment with nr. Similarly in Figs. 5 and 6, the difference in orientation
between the straight lines and the circles in the vicinity of the latter is more apparent to
the eye, than at greater distances from them, so that undoubtedly the apparent orientation of
both straight lines must be modified (in opposing directions) in the vicinity of the arc.
Whether this attempt at explanation is valid or sufficient, I leave to the judgment of the
reader. A readily made observation in its support seems to me to be that if one tries to sketch
by eye the direction of the streets of a crookedly laid out town, or the intersections at various
angles of forest paths (and thus tries to lay out a plan or map or them), the acute angles are
as a rule overestimated, and the obtuse angles (insofar as they are apprehended as angles)
rather underestimated.
Finally, a third group of optical illusions in this category comprise those, which concern
size relationships of simultaneously observed dimensions (irrespective of vertical or
horizontal attitude), in particular the division of surfaces and lines.
I submit first the following observation.
Let us stick a strip of black paper about ½00 wide and 1000 to 1200 long on a white surface,
and then let a nai¨ve observer lay two quite thin little paper strips of arbitrary length and of
the color of the background at right angles over the black strip, and then so adjust their
position that the latter appears partitioned into three equal segments. If now we check the
accuracy of this partitioning with compasses, we will as a rule observe, that--at least at a first
attempt--the two outer segments, in comparison with the middle one, will turn out rather too
large. The same happens with a white strip of paper on a black ground--evidence, therefore,
that in this case irradiation (in the usual sense of the word) plays no role. In the same way,
and at the same time still more strikingly, we obtain the same result, if the strip is divided not
into three, but (with three transverse strips) into four apparently equal parts, or alternatively
is left partitioned into three, of which the middle one is double in extent.
The result of this test is, no doubt, essentially in agreement with the extent to which visual
estimation of an observer (in the broad sense of the term) is sharpened by practice, as well as
by the amount of time and care taken in the equal partitioning of the adjacent segments.
The result in question is still more clearly and certainly apparent, when we do not have the
observer carry out the partitioning himself, but set before him previously partitioned strips
for the assessment. Should we choose, for example, two strips, of which one has been divided
exactly into three equal parts (with fine transverse lines) and the other so divided that the
middle segment is just a very little too short, the majority of observers will judge the latter as
the one equally partitioned; whereas to the contrary no error occurs, when beside the
correctly partitioned strip we place a second, in which the middle segment is a little too
long. Most convincingly of all, finally, is a test with two such strips, one of them with the
middle segment a little too large and the other by an equal amount too small: in this case, all
observers judge the latter as more accurately partitioned.
In a similar way, if we divide for example an octavo sheet of paper with vertical lines into
three columns of equal width, the two outer ones appear somewhat smaller than the one in
the middle.
To convince myself of the extent to which the thickness of the partitioning lines might have
some influence, I repeated the tests described with strips which were partitioned (not with
8 i-Perception
very fine lines, but) with black lines of 0.100 width, taking care however to add to both ends of
the partitioned paper strip half the width of such partitioning lines (0.0500) also in black
color, so that the intervening spaces left white were equal- or were unequal, in the way
described: the result was however exactly the same (as also against a grayish or brownish
background).
When by chance I mentioned these observations to a skilled and experienced artist, they
did not really come to him as news: rather, he confirmed my belief that we can note similar
visual misjudgments with all equally partitioned surfaces (the facades of a building,
colonnades, etc.) in that consistently the outer-lying parts, adjacent to the ``air,'' appear
somewhat smaller, because as he put it in his over-blown artistic terms, ``each time the air
gobbles them up,'' that is to say, the background decreases the apparent extent of the
surfaces lying adjacent to it; and indeed that allowance was made already in ancient
architecture, consciously or instinctively, for this tendency of the eye. Irradiation does not
appear to me responsible in this case on the grounds already set forth earlier: rather, I am
much more inclined here again to invoke an effect on the extended surface of the background
which through greater or lesser proximity facilitates or inhibits comparison.
A second experiment that is relevant here is the following:
Suppose we construct with fine white, or alternatively black strips, on an accordingly black
or white background, two obtuse triangles with unequal sides of, for example, 700, 12½00, and
1600, so that the latter edge forms the base of the triangles. In one of these two triangles, we
divide this base exactly and draw up from the midpoint a transversal (of the same color as the
sides of the triangles) to the apex. In the other by contrast, we draw the transversal from a
point on the base, which lies about 1/400 nearer to the smallest angle. If we now ask a naive
observer, before whom we lay out the two triangles side by side, in which one the bisection of
the base appears accurate, he will as a rule choose the latter, in which one half is longer than
the other by 1/200 (see Figs. 7 and 8).
Some small variations on the experiment, with moveable transversals, will suggest
themselves easily. However, this will generally only succeed if we involve only such
persons who do not through practice possess truly experienced visual estimation, and even
in that case the correct relationship will often be reported as a consequence of somewhat
longer and more careful observation.
On the other hand, the illusion remains robust in the following case. We construct in the
same way two congruent obtuse triangles (as in Figs. 9 and 10) with sides, for example, of 700,
1500, and 1000 (once again with the last as the horizontal base) and divide the base as before
Wade et al. 9
with a transversal, in one triangle exactly, in the other shifted about 0.400 from the middle
toward the obtuse angle.
Here again, the question as to which base is most correctly bisected is as a rule answered in
error. The illusion arises in this case, in comparison with the previous experiment, exactly in
the opposite sense; yet, the explanation confirms that already advanced. That is to say, the
eye apparently misassociates the bisection of the (small) angle at the apex with the bisection
of the base, and holds the bisection of the latter in that case for more accurate, in which the
partition of the former approaches the correct bisection.
Still more striking is finally the following observation, which I have regularly made when
teaching geometry.
We draw in acircleof arbitraryradius(asin Fig. 11), two diametersatright angles, andfrom the
ends of each construct arcs, of the same radius, to the extent that they fall within the
aforementioned circle, whose circumference is, as is well known, dividedinto 12equal arcs(of 30).
The equality of these 12 segments appears, however, to most pupils at first glance so
unbelievable, with, in particular, the middle of the three segments in each quadrant
appearing so much larger that they are disinclined to try to prove the correctness of the
geometrical construction.
10 i-Perception
The basis for the illusion here again lies in the partial misassociation by the eye of the
partitioning of the area of the quadrant with that of its perimeter, misled by the inequality of
the former to judge the latter also as unequal. We see this immediately if, having made the 12-
fold division of the circumference, the inner arcs (of the same radius) are inverted that is to
say drawn out as from points m, n, r, s, and so forth as in Fig. 12 (now naturally as arcs of
only 60) whereby the illusion immediately vanishes or is even reversed.
The correctness of the explanatory principle indicated follows also from a related
simplification of the experiment, which, for example, might take the form that we bisect
the two longer sides of a rectangle with an arc, as shown in Fig. 13, whose center lies in
the middle of one of the two smaller sides: here again, the eye readily attributes to the division
of the contours the inequality of the partitioning of the area.
A similar illusion appears if, as shown in Figs. 14 and 15, parallel lines are divided into
three segments with arcs, as will be apparent with just a glance at the figures, and so forth.
Wade et al. 11
That the same principle also applies with partitioning using straight lines under similar
circumstances is shown, for example, in Fig. 16, where a perpendicular constructed from the
middle of the base of an obtuse triangle appears strikingly nearer to the apex of the acute
angle and so forth.
Commentary
Oppel gave the simple figures that induced spatial distortions the label geometrical­optical
illusions in order to confine them to the relatively small but reliable distortions of visual
space, mostly in the domains of size or orientation. This implicit classification has proved too
restrictive as some combine both dimensions and others involve different dimensions
altogether. Vicario (2011) listed 26 different classifications! Perhaps the simplest is the one
proposed by Boring (1942): extent, direction, and the rest. The common factors of the
classifications are direction (orientation), size, contrast, assimilation, and perspective. Some
systems are concerned with the distorted dimensions (like size and orientation), others
involve possible underlying processes (like assimilation and contrast, and eye movements),
and yet others characterize the levels at which the illusions should be considered (like
physical, physiological, and psychological). Oppel touches on all these factors in his article.
In his introductory remarks, Oppel states that geometrical­optical illusions are clearly
different from what are usually called optical illusions, such as in the moon illusion. He
considered that the other optical illusions are characterized by the relations of three
quantities, apparent size (visual angle), real size, and distance of objects, and they are
based on the fact that if one of a pair of these magnitudes is wrongly set too high or too
low, the third one is judged incorrectly. In contrast, geometrical­optical illusions are not
influenced by either the distance or the visual angle of the display.
His account commences with the observation that vertical dimensions generally appear
larger than corresponding equal horizontal dimensions. The discussion gives the impression
that the phenomenon was in common currency among teachers of geometry so that there was
no need to cite Fick (1851). Indeed, Oppel's article is free from references to others. His
12 i-Perception
examples of horizontal­vertical illusions include a variety of figures like rectangles, ellipses,
cylinders, and triangles. Oppel claimed that the explanation of all these phenomena is
``without doubt'' the fact that the eye is accustomed to see much larger extents in the
horizontal than in the vertical orientation, and thus out of habit slightly overestimates the
vertical extents. This leads him to examine figures which display apparent angle expansion,
contour attraction, and repulsion as well as illusions of extent due to line intersections.
Some of Oppel's designs (Figs. 11 to 15) bear a certain similarity to the famous
configuration introduced much later by Mu
¨ ller-Lyer (1889). This relation was noted by
Wundt (1898) and Todorovic
´ (2017). Mu
¨ ller-Lyer himself was apparently unaware of
Oppel's work, since he did not cite Oppel in his papers. There are similar precursors to the
orientation illusions associated with Zo
¨ llner (1860). One of Oppel's colleagues noted that
when two lines forming an obtuse angle cross a straight line, the latter looks as if slightly bent
or broken (his Fig. 3). A similar small bulging effect appears when the two parallel lines are
almost touched by circular arcs (Fig. 5).
Oppel followed his ground-breaking paper of 1855 with two more on geometrical­optical
illusions (Oppel, 1857, 1861) illustrations from which are shown in Figure 2. Nine figures
were included in the first supplement (eight images in the first three rows, and left image in the
fourth row in Figure 2), and several types of illusion were discussed. One involved errors in
locating the midpoints of lines embedded in simple geometrical configurations (left and
middle image in the first row). This effect is closely related, if not identical, to the Thie
´ ry-
Wundt illusion (Anstis, Gregory, & Heard, 2009; Day & Kim, 2010; Thie
´ ry, 1896; Wundt,
1898) and Judd's illusion (Judd, 1899; Morgan, 1969). For some examples and variations of
this effect, see Todorovic
´ (2014, 2017). Oppel not only presented graphical illustrations for
the readers to inspect but also reported quantitative data in the form of the number of
observers who experienced the illusion (in one case 85 out of 88). In addition, he included
a control experiment with a related configuration for which there was no illusion (right image
in first row). Another type of effect involved errors in the judgments of areas of geometrical
figures (three images in second row). One of his several examples was a circle surrounded by
an annulus which has the same area as the circle; his students stated that the area of the
annulus looked smaller than that of the circle. He also claimed that if a sequence of figures is
presented all of which have approximately the same area (a triangle, a square, a pentagon, a
hexagon, a heptagon, an octagon, and a circle), then the members of the sequence look
increasingly smaller in area (both to nai¨ve and trained observers, but to the latter only
when they inspected the figures casually). He also reported that some observations on
perceived lengths of segments of lines (illustrated in two images in the third row), which,
like some figures in the first paper, were anticipations of the Mu
¨ ller-Lyer illusion.
The second supplement (Oppel, 1861) included five illustrations (the two images on the
right in row 4 and the three images in row 5 in Figure 2) and was also concerned with a
number of phenomena. He was surprised when he saw a professional painter use a compass
to measure the correct distance to paint the reflection of a rock from the water level. The
painter explained that the reason was to avoid an illusion, whose presence Oppel confirmed
for himself when his judgment of the distance turned out to be too short. He also claimed that
in several wall frescos from Pompeii depicting Narcissus admiring his own reflection in a
pool, the reflection was painted too high. Prompted by these observations, Oppel conducted a
study with 40 observers who each made 10 quantitative judgments on various configurations,
which he described but did not illustrate, and whose data were reported in full in a table.
However, the results turned out to be somewhat ambiguous. Another effect involved
distributing several equidistant dots along the longer diagonal of a rhombus, and noting
that the distances nearest to the corners looked shortest (the three images in the bottom row).

This observation anticipates the results of Warren and Bashford (1977), Post, Welch, and
Caufield (1998), and Predebon (2001), all of whom found that the illusory shortening of the
shaft in the wings-in version of the Mu
¨ ller-Lyer illusion is not uniform but confined to the
region near the vertices of the wings. Finally, Oppel devoted less than a page, without any
accompanying figures, to the observation that undivided lines or areas appear smaller than
when they are divided, an effect now known as the Oppel-Kundt or filled-space illusion
(Kundt, 1863; Wackermann, 2017). It is ironic that the only geometrical­optical illusion
with which Oppel's name is linked is one that he did not illustrate. His example involved
squares which, as he already noted in the 1855 paper, are drawn wider (horizontally) than
they are tall (vertically). Here, he noted that this difference is even larger when the task is to
draw a square on a paper with horizontal lines (with the side of the square being equal to four
or five times the distance between the lines), so that the square is divided into several parts in
Figure 2. Illusion figures presented in Oppel (1857, 1861). The eight images in the first three rows and the
left image in the fourth row are from Oppel (1857); the two images on the right in fourth row and the three
images in fifth row are from Oppel (1861).

the vertical direction. Oppel realized that in this case, the effect is confounded with the
general exaggeration of the vertical dimension, described in his first paper, and suggested
an ``easy control experiment'' in which the lined paper is turned by 90, so that the lines are
now vertical. He noted that in this case, the width of the drawn figure is still wider than its
height, but to a smaller extent than before. In both papers, Oppel reported some observations
on architectural details, illustrated in the fourth row of Figure 2.
Conclusion
Oppel (1855) performed a service to visual science by defining a subset of illusion figures that
have been investigated intensively ever since. In addition, he presented precursors of
orientation and size illusions that are associated with the names of later researchers.

Note
1. If half the body length is taken to be a unit of measure, and if the distance of the eye of the observer
from the middle part of the length, expressed in such units, ¼ e, then, as a simple trigonometrical
derivation shows, the relation of the tangent of the visual angle of the lying body (viewed from the
side) to the tangent of the visual angle for the upright body, is as e: (e2À1), that is, quite exactly as
2e2: 2e2À1; the latter is thus always smaller.
