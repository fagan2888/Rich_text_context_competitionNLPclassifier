Objective: This study addressed the hypothesis that variation in genes associated with dopamine function (SLC6A3,
DRD2, DRD4), serotonin function (SLC6A4, and regulation of monoamine levels (MAOA) may be predictive of BMI
categories (obese and overweight + obese) in young adulthood and of changes in BMI as adolescents transition into
young adulthood. Interactions with gender and race/ethnicity were also examined.
Methods and Procedures: Participants were a subsample of individuals from the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health (Add Health), a nationally representative sample of adolescents followed from 1995 to 2002. The
sample analyzed included a subset of 1,584 unrelated individuals with genotype data. Multiple logistic regressions
were conducted to evaluate the associations between genotypes and obesity (BMI > 29.9) or overweight + obese
combined (BMI  25) with normal weight (BMI = 18.5­24.9) as a referent. Linear regression models were used to
examine change in BMI from adolescence to young adulthood.
Results: Significant associations were found between SLC6A4 5HTTLPR and categories of BMI, and between MAOA
promoter variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) among men and categories of BMI. Stratified analyses revealed that
the association between these two genes and excess BMI was significant for men overall and for white and Hispanic
men specifically. Linear regression models indicated a significant effect of SLC6A4 5HTTLPR on change in BMI from
adolescence to young adulthood.
Discussion: Our findings lend further support to the involvement of genes implicated in dopamine and serotonin
regulation on energy balance.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity increases the risk for a number of serious health con-
ditions including cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and
some cancers (1,2). Thus, the identification of biological, psy-
chological,environmental,social,andgeneticfactorsthatinter-
act to influence overweight and obesity is of high importance
(3). Although the causes of obesity in society are numerous, at
the individual level, genetics is thought to play an important
role in regulating energy balance and in the development of
obesity (4). Both twin and family studies suggest that obesity
is influenced by genetic factors (5­7) and several candidate
genes have been associated with obesity-related phenotypes.
The 2005 Human Obesity Gene Map reported that 127 can-
didate genes have been found to be significantly associated
with obesity-related phenotypes across 416 studies (8). Yet, the
number of genes found to be consistently associated with obes-
ity-related phenotypes across these studies (n = 22) is much
smaller. An emerging area of research has begun to explore the
potential association between specific candidate genes regulat-
ing brain serotonin and dopamine systems with obesity. These
neurotransmitter systems are hypothesized to regulate behav-
ioral and metabolic responses associated with the development
of obesity through feeding and satiety (9).
Converging evidence suggests that dopaminergic neu-
rotransmission regulates feeding behaviors in humans
(10­12) and is associated with higher BMI (13). Candidate
gene studies of dopamine-related genes have focused on the
dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2), DRD4, and solute carrier

family 6--neurotransmitter transporter, dopamine--mem-
ber 3 (SLC6A3) genes. Findings from studies of DRD2 have
been mixed with some studies detecting an association with

obesity-related phenotypes (14­18), whereas others report no
association (19­23). At least two studies of DRD4 have shown
an association between higher BMI and carriers of the 7 repeat
allele found in the third exon of the gene (24,25). One of these
studies suggested that the association was influenced by race,
as it was presented among African Americans and Hispanics,
but not American whites (24). Finally, two studies of current
smokers have reported an association between SLC6A3 and
the phenotypes of obesity (20) and food reinforcement (26).
Thus, there is increasing evidence that the dopaminergic sys-
tem may indeed be involved in obesity-related phenotypes.
Serotonergic functioning has also been hypothesized to be
important for regulating eating behaviors and body weight
(27,28). For instance, administration of serotonergic agents
have been shown to suppress eating behaviors (29,30) and
reduce craving for high carbohydrate foods (31). Candidate
gene studies of the serotonergic system have examined the
amino acid transporter gene and the serotonin receptor and
transporter genes. At least two studies have indicated a rela-
tionship between the SLC6A14 gene and obesity-related

phenotypes (32,33). This gene is relevant to serotonin signal-
ing as it is associated with tryptophan availability for serotonin
synthesis. An association has been found between a polymor-
phism of the serotonin receptor 2A locus (HTR2A -1438A>G)
and higher levels of abdominal obesity and BMI among adults
(34,35) and increased energy and fat intake in children (36).
There is an additional support for this polymorphism being
involved in energy balance in overweight adult subjects (37).
However, one subsequent study failed to detect an associa-
tion with this polymorphism and obesity in children, though
the study was underpowered (38). Fewer studies have exam-
ined serotonin transport gene with the exception of a recent
study of Argentinean adolescents which found an association
between a polymorphism of the serotonin transporter SLC6A4
and overweight (39).
The monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene produces an
enzyme that metabolizes dopamine and serotonin (in addition
to noradrenaline) and it has also been examined for association
with obesity phenotypes. In a large UK cohort (n = 1,150) of
white women, significant associations were detected between
MAOA and BMI, with the low-activity genotype (3/3) being
more frequent among obese women (40). This finding sup-
ports a family-based study in which preferential transmission
of the low activity­related allele was observed among subjects
with BMI  35 kg/m2 (41).
Although the possible association between genes regu-
lating dopamine and serotonin with obesity is promis-
ing, the relevance is uncertain with respect to population
level effects. This is because many studies are derived from

clinical or convenience samples making it difficult to extrapo-
late to general populations. Therefore, replication studies in

population-based cohorts are clearly warranted (42). Using a
large 
population-based cohort of young adults, we addressed
the hypothesis that variation in genes associated with dop-
amine function (SLC6A3, DRD2, DRD4), serotonin func-
tion (SLC6A4), and regulation of monoamine levels (MAOA)
may be predictive of BMI categories (obese and overweight +
obese) in young adulthood, as well as predictive of changes
in BMI as adolescents transit into young adulthood. As stud-
ies have shown that gender can affect both feeding (43) and
addictive behaviors (44) and allelic frequency of these genes
(45) and expression (46) vary by ethnic/racial ancestry, we fur-
ther evaluated gene by gender and gene by race interactions.
To examine the factors driving interaction effects, we followed
significant effects with stratified analyses when 
sample sizes
permitted.
METHODS AND Procedures
Data source
The study population was 20,745 adolescents from the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a nationally
representative study of adolescents. The longitudinal cohort includes
15,197 eligible respondents who completed in-home surveys on three
separate occasions (April­December, 1995, April­August, 1996, and
August 2001­August 2002). The mean age of survey participants in the
three waves of data collection was 15.65 (s.d. = 1.75) years, 16.22 (s.d. =
1.64) years, and 22.96 (s.d. = 1.77) years. All survey participants at Wave
III were 18 years of age or older. By design, the Add Health survey
included a sample stratified by region, urbanicity, school type, 
ethnic
mix, and size to garner a nationally representative sample. Precise
details regarding the design and data collection have been described
elsewhere (47,48).
Study sample
At Wave III, a subset of individuals identified to be full siblings or twins
at earlier waves (n = 3,787) consented to provide a saliva sample for
DNA analysis. The study conformed to local institutional review board
approved procedures (further details can be obtained at www.cpc.unc.
edu/projects/addhealth). For our analyses, we included only unre-
lated individuals by randomly selecting one sibling from each sibship.
Participants who were pregnant were excluded from analysis (n = 51).
For the analyses comparing normal weight individuals (defined as BMI
between 18.5 and 25) to obese individuals (BMI > 30), the total available
sample included 1,133 individuals. For the analyses comparing normal
weight individuals to overweight and obese individuals (BMI > 25), the
total available sample included 1,584 individuals. Genotype was miss-
ing for one or more of the genetic markers for some individuals which
resulted in variability in the total number of individuals available for
each gene-specific analysis.
Genotyping
Buccal samples were collected on the participants and DNA extracted
using a modification of procedures described previously (49­52) (fur-
ther details at www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth). Six functional
polymorphisms were genotyped within six candidate genes that had
beenpreviouslyassociatedwithbehavioralandpsychologicaloutcomes.
The following were genotyped according to procedures described pre-
viously (53,54): a 40-basepair (bp) variable number tandem repeat
(VNTR) polymorphism in the 3 untranslated region of the dopamine
transporter (SLC6A3), a 44-bp insertion/
deletion polymorphism
(5HTTLPR) in the promoter of the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4),
the Taq1A DRD2 polymorphism (DRD2), a 48-bp VNTR in exon 3
of the DRD4, and a 30-bp VNTR in the promoter of the MAOA gene.
The T479A substitution in the CYP2A6 gene, associated with nicotine
metabolism, was also genotyped in the same DNA samples, but this
genotype data were not used in this study.

genetics
The genotypes were tested for deviations from Hardy Weinberg Equi-
librium (HWE). Deviations from HWE could indicate either a problem
with the genotyping assay or a true association with an outcome. To
examine the second hypothesis, we tested for deviations from HWE in
the overall data set, in the normal weight subset, the obese subset, and
the obese/overweight subset.
BMI
BMI was calculated based on height and weight (BMI = weight in
kilograms/height in meters2) measured by Add Health staff during the
in-home interviews at Wave II and Wave III. Height and weight were
self-reported at Wave I and thus, analyses of BMI were restricted to
Wave II and III.
Sociodemographic variables
Covariates included indicators of socioeconomic status (e.g., parental
reported education reported by parents at Wave I), chronological age
of participant at Wave III, and self-identified race/ethnicity. American
Indians and Asians were excluded from the analyses because they were
underrepresented in the available data. Thus, our analyses only included
American whites, African Americans, and Hispanics.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS-callable SUDAAN (ver-
sion 8.0) statistical software (55). SUDAAN allows for control of survey
design effects of individuals clustered in sampling unit of school and
stratification of geographic region. The specific genotypes were grouped
for analysis according to the extant literature with these candidate genes
(56,57). MAOA, which is located at chromosome Xp11.23, was strati-
fied on gender. Two separate sets of multiple logistic regressions were
conducted. In the first, regression was used to identify the variables
which predicted obesity (BMI > 29.9) using normal weight (BMI =
18.5­24.9) as a referent to identify genetic factors associated with the
highest level of risk. In the second, regression was used to predict over-
weight + obese combined (BMI  25). This approach allowed for the
identification of any risk factors associated with above normal weight.
Participants who were underweight (<18.5; n = 47) were excluded. Each
polymorphism was evaluated separately. Models included the interac-
tion between the allele and either sex or race/ethnicity. Age, race, and
parental education level were included as covariates. To clarify the
interpretation of significant interaction effects, stratified analyses were
conducted and odds ratios were calculated when samples sizes permit-
ted. For stratified analyses where fewer than five individuals were repre-
sented in a genotype category, the CLUMP program (58) was used with
10,000 simulations to further verify a significant departure of observed
values from expected values.
Linear regression models were used to examine the change in BMI
from Wave II to Wave III. Although Add Health did collect information
regarding height and weight at Wave I (1 year before Wave II), the infor-
mation was based on self-report. Thus, to reduce potential bias, a con-
servative approach was taken by only looking at the change from Wave
II to Wave III where height and weight were measured by study staff. The
outcome measure for these analyses was based on a raw score change in
BMI (as opposed to a z-score change) as has been recommended by Cole
et al. (59), and by Berkey and Colditz (60). Models included age, sex, self-
reported race/ethnicity, and parental education as covariates.
RESULTS
Table 1 displays the overall socio-demographics by BMI cate-
gory(normalweightvs.obesevs.overweight+obese).Bivariate
chi square analyses revealed significant differences among BMI
category for race/ethnicity, parental education and age (P <
0.05), and a trend for gender (normal vs. overweight + obese,
P = 0.07). Table 2 describes genotype frequencies overall and
by BMI categories included in the analyses. Genotype distribu-
tions in the normal weight BMI strata exhibited HWE (all Ps >
0.05). However, the genotype distributions in the obese BMI
strata deviated from HWE for the SLC6A4 marker (P = 0.02).
Similarly, the genotype distributions in the overweight + obese
BMI strata also deviated from HWE for the SLC6A4 marker
(P = 0.009). As the genotype distributions in the larger, all
inclusive data set generally met HWE, we do not believe that
genotyping errors contributed to the deviations from HWE
that we observed in the obese and overweight + obese strata.
The association between genotypes and obesity and over-
weight + obese can be viewed in Table 3. No associations with
obesityoroverweight+obesewerefoundforpolymorphismsin
SLC6A3, DRD2, DRD4, or MAOA (women). Among men, the
MAOA polymorphism was found to be associated with obesity
and with overweight + obese. Among men, the prevalence of
obesity and overweight + obese was significantly higher among
carriers of the low-activity variant of MAOA. Also among men
a significant gene by race/ethnicity interaction was observed
for MAOA for the normal vs. overweight + obese comparison
(Table 4). The association between the low-activity variant and
the overweight + obese category was significant for whites and
Hispanics, but not for African Americans.
A significant main effect for the 5HTTLPR polymorphism
in the SLC6A4 gene was also observed (Table 3). The preva-
lence of obesity and overweight + obese combined was sig-
nificantly lower among carriers of the l variant compared with

individuals homozygous for the s variant. Significant gene by
gender interaction revealed that this pattern of greater obe
sity and overweight + obesity among carriers of the s/s vari-
ant was significant for men, but not for women (see Table 4).
Significant gene by race/ethnicity interactions were also
observed for white men homozygotes of either allele of the
5HTTLPR polymorphism, which were overrepresented in the
obese and overweight + obese BMI categories (see Table 4).
The pattern was somewhat different for Hispanic men where
s/s homozygotes or s/l heterozygotes were overrepresented
in the obese and overweight + obese BMI categories (see
Table 4). As can be seen in Table 4, the confidence intervals
for the association between the SLC6A4 gene and obesity and
overweight + obesity are wide when the analysis is restricted
to Hispanic men, indicating small cell counts for these com-
parisons. To further verify a significant departure of observed
values from expected values the CLUMP (58) program was
applied to this subset. The permutation analyses indicated
that the genotype frequencies among obese and overweight
+ obese combined differed significantly in comparison to
those in the normal weight group (Table 5). Also note that,
as described above, the SLC6A4 polymorphism significantly
deviated from HWE in the obese and overweight + obese
strata, and this was confined to the non-Hispanic white ethnic
group which was the largest ethnic sample.
Analyses also examined change in BMI from Wave II, when
participants were on average 16.5 years of age, to Wave III,
when participant were on average 22 years of age. The only
polymorphism that was significantly associated with change
in BMI was the 5HTTLPR polymorphism at the SLC6A4

gene (Table 6). 5HTTLPR s/s homozygotes demonstrated the
greatest change in BMI from Wave II to Wave III, an average
increase of 4.1 BMI units, compared to an increase of an aver-
age 3.5 BMI units among l/l homozygotes and 3.4 BMI units
among s/l heterozygotes (Table 6 and Figure 1). A trend,
although not significant, between the DRD4 Ex3 VNTR and
change in BMI was observed (carriers of at least one 7 repeat
allele demonstrated a mean change of 3.36, where as carriers
who did not possess any 7 repeat allele demonstrated a mean
change of 3.66, P = 0.07).
DISCUSSION
The primary findings of this study are significant associations
between the SLC6A4 5HTTLPR and categories of BMI, and
between the MAOA promoter VNTR and categories of BMI
among men. These associations were found controlling for
other factors (gender, race/ethnicity, age, and parental educa-
tion). A significant interaction effect was found for the asso-
ciation between these genes and BMI by both race/ethnicity
and gender. The subsequent stratified analyses revealed that
the association between SLC6A4 and excess BMI was signifi-
cant for men overall, and for white and Hispanic men. SLC6A4

5HTTLPR genotypes were found to deviate from HWE in the
cases (obese and overweight + obese) but not the controls (nor-
mal BMI), with the ss homozygote genotype found in excess
of expectation. Stratified analyses for MAOA among men indi-
cated that the promoter VNTR was significantly associated with
overweight + obese in white and in Hispanic men, as well.
Auniquecontributionofthisstudyisapreviouslyun
reported
association between obesity and candidate gene SLC6A4 in a
US population-based sample. The findings of our study con-
firm findings from a recently published study demonstrating
an association between the s allele of the SLC6A4 5HTTLPR
polymorphism and overweight among a sample of Argentinean
children and adolescents (61). They also extend these findings
by providing evidence for association between overweight +
obesity and the s allele 5HTTLPR homozygote in men of white
race and Hispanic ethnicity. The present findings regarding the
association between SLC6A4 and BMI categories are consist-
ent with the putative role of serotonin on food craving and
obesity (28,62) and the direction of the results are also consist-
ent with the hypothesized expression effects of the 5HTTLPR
polymorphism. The s allele is believed to reduce the transcrip-
tional activity of the promoter (63) and is associated with less
serotonin transporter protein (63,64). An association between
anxiety-related traits with a polymorphism in the serotonin
transporter gene regulatory region has been noted (63). Thus,
one potential hypothesis for the association between this gene
and obesity may be a mediating effect of increased dietary
intake as a means of affect regulation.
Further, the findings of this study regarding an association
between MAOA and BMI are interesting in light of one family-
based study (41) and two recent large-scale association studies
(40,65). Using the transmission disequilibrium test, evaluating
the degree to which parents transmit this gene to their obese
offspring, Camarena et al. (41) found the low active variant to
be associated with obesity (41). Extending this in a large popu-
lation-based study, Need et al. (40) found that European white
women (Mean age = 47 years) carriers of the low active variant
were significantly more likely to be obese (BMI > 30). Ducci et al.
(65) found a significant association between BMI and MAOA
genotype, with the low-activity allele associated with a higher
BMI among a sample of primarily non-obese men participants
with and without a history of alcohol dependence (65).
Our findings indicated some interesting potential gender
effects. Gene by gender interactions indicated the relationship
between gene (specifically, SLC6A4 and MAOA) and over-
weight or overweight + obese were significant for men. Need
et al. observed an association between MAOA and categories
of BMI among their women sample, whereas no association
between MAOA and categories of BMI was noted in our sample
of women. This may reflect an age related effect, as the mean age
of women in our study was much younger (mean age of 22 years
in our study vs. mean age of 48 in Need et al., study). Expression
of MAOA is affected by ovarian hormones which can fluctu-
ate with age (66). It has been shown that ovarian steroids, par-
ticularly estrogen, can decrease MAOA expression, resulting
in elevated serotonin levels (66,67). The degree to which these
potential age-related effects represent a true effect will need to
be verified in other samples in a wider age range.
Dopamine has been associated with the reinforcement value
of food (68,69) and variation in dopaminergic activity in the
brain has been associated with obesity (13). The association
of the MAOA low activity VNTR variant and increased BMI
from this study would be consistent, in part, with these obser-
vations as MAOA is implicated in dopamine metabolism (40).
However, we did not find that polymorphisms in the DRD2
and DRD4 and the dopamine transporter were statistically sig-
nificantly associated with BMI categories in this young adult
sample. It is unlikely that these null results for the main effects
models are a result of low statistical power, as many of the
cell counts in these models for these dopamine-related genes
were of sufficient size and much larger than studies to date.
Nevertheless, there are several possible explanations. First, can-
didate gene studies of the TaqI A polymorphism at the DRD2
gene have not been completely consistent, with some studies
reporting an association (15­17,19,70) and other reporting no
association (20­22,26). Second, the difference in samples with
regard to age and country of origin also make it difficult to
compare our findings to other studies of dopamine candidate
genes. Finally, there was only a single polymorphism within
each candidate gene which was available for analysis. The
authors only had access to the genotypes provided by the Add
Health study, and could not perform further genotyping on the
data set. It is possible that genetic variations in other parts of
these (or other) genes in the dopaminergic system are associ-
ated with obe
sity in this population-based sample. However, it
will require future studies to further examine this hypothesis.
The trends observed between DRD4 presented in our study
areconsistentwiththefindingsreportedbyGuoetal.(24)using
this same public-use data set. These investigators employed a
somewhat different analytic procedure using the complete
sample of related and unrelated individuals and included data
from the self-report of height and weight obtained through the
Add Health study at Wave I. These investigators found a signif-
icant association between DRD4 and obesity among African
Americans and Hispanics. We chose to limit our analyses to
unrelated individuals only, and we further limited our analy-
sis using measured height and weight assessed during young
adulthood to construct BMI categories. When we examined
the association between change in BMI and DRD4, we did find
an association approaching significance (P = 0.07).
While we are enthusiastic about the findings presented here,
caution is warranted in interpretation. Initial reports from
candidate gene studies, in general, may overestimate the effect
(71) and modest yet significant effects are reported here. Also,
we did not apply a Bonferroni correction because many of the
phenotypic tests were related and this would have resulted
in an over-conservative correction. However, a large number
of statistical comparisons were conducted which may have
potentially inflated the risk of Type I error. Thus, replication
is needed before definitive conclusions can be made about the
role of these genes on regulating weight and risk of obesity.
Also, future studies are planned to examine the interactions
354 VOLUME 16 NUMBER 2 | FEBRUARY 2008 | www.obesityjournal.org
articles
genetics
with other psychological states and traits which may help to
better explain these associations as some of the psychological
states overlap with risk of obesity. Of note, we did not find that
the associations that were present for Hispanics and American
whites were also present for African Americans in this sam-
ple. Furthermore, the association observed for whites between
SLC6A4 and obesity did not exhibit the same pattern as it did
for Hispanics. These differences may represent the reduced
power in the stratified model, genetic heterogeneity within the
Hispanic and African American groups, or both factors. This
will need to be further studied with larger sub-samples of non-
white participants. Another limitation of the current study was
that other indicators of adiposity or body composition (e.g.,
waist circumference, skin fold measures) were not present in
the Add Health study. In general, BMI is a good proxy, but
examining the association between these candidate genes and
other indicators of adiposity and body composition would
strengthen the findings. Also of note, these analyses did not
account for age of pubertal onset which is potentially impor-
tant to the analyses of change in BMI; however, given that the
median age at Wave II was 17 (Mean = 16.5), this may have
had little effect, as most participants would likely have been
post-pubertal onset. Further, as described above, it would have
been ideal to have additional candidate gene data available, and
multiple polymorphisms within the genes to test other hypoth-
esis as well as evaluate the effects of population stratification.
However, currently only a limited amount of genetic data are
available for analysis using this cohort.
Our findings lend further support to the involvement of
dopamine and serotonin regulation on energy balance (9). The
results underscore the need for additional research examining
the role of these systems on BMI and other energy-balance
behaviors (e.g., diet and physical activity). Additional work
is needed to identify the potential complex gene by gene and
gene by environment interactions that may further characte
rize these main effects.
