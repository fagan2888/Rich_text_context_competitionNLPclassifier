A scrutiny of existing literature suggests that traditional rural retailers are important for
the success of rural marketing efforts in developing nations. The present study attempts
to decipher the indications on the factors that could possibly influence purchase pref-
erences of rural traditional retailers through the use of statistical methods of content
analysis. The purpose of the study is to identify the factors that influence purchase
preference, analyse the temporal movement of conceptualizations of these factors, and
determine whether academic thought on this topic has a conceptual core.
This research work presents a longitudinal analysis of the factors over a period of
40 years: the need for information and training on new products and their selling
techniques seem to maintain the same significance throughout the study period; the
need for discounts has maintained almost a uniform ranking over the period of study;
there is also a relative stability in the need for regular/frequent service; doorstep
delivery had the highest ranking in the first period, which is probably owing to the
relative weakness of delivery systems during the early phase of rural marketing; the
requirement for credit seems to increase from the first period to the second period and
then decrease. The factor of margins and commissions seems highly ranked only in
the second period.
Dimension reduction technique and frequency tabulations are the methods used
for content analysis. The core concepts indicate that a traditional rural retailer can
possibly be persuaded to purchase high-demand products and brands, through the
provision of credit, discounts, quantity discount schemes, margins and commis-
sions, by using local distributors and by appointment of local company staff to
provide regular service. The analysis has yielded two discernible conceptual clusters:
high-demand products and brands and credit; and doorstep delivery and regular
service. The clusters that emerge during the content analysis of traditional rural
retailers' purchase preference factors reflect the exact content from conclusions in at
least one research paper that is not used (to prevent cyclic conclusions) during the
content-analysis process. The result confirms that researchers have been moving on
similar lines in their conceptualizations of the purchase preference factors of tradi-
tional rural retailers.

Summary
10 PURCHASE PREFERENCE FACTORS FOR TRADITIONAL RURAL RETAILERS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL CONCEPTUAL STUDY
Theory on purchase behaviour owes its origin to
theStPetersburgparadoxpresentedbyNicholas
Bernoulli in the year 1713 (recounted by Stigler,
1950). Since then, the field of consumer buying behav-
iour has expanded enough to warrant dedicated
review papers on the past literature (e.g., MacInnis &
Folkes, 2010). A buyer behaviour model can help the
marketer to analyse available information about the
market, identify the need for additional information,
specify targets for marketing effort, and identify the
kinds of information needed by various purchasing
decision-makers and the criteria that they will use to
make these decisions (adapted from Webster & Wind,
1972). Buyer behaviour studies may be divided into
two broad classes corresponding to consumer markets
and organizational markets (Wilson, 2000). A review of
extant literature on organizational buyer behaviour has
shown the presence of six distinct megatrends: Internet
revolution, inorganic growth through mergers and
acquisitions, break-up of vertical integration, privat-
ization of public sector industries, rise of emerging
economies such as China and India, and globalization
of markets (Sheth, 2006). The theoretical foundations of
organizational purchase behaviour studies have been
extended to organized retailers--it has been suggested
that retailers behave both like organizations and
individual consumers (Sheth, 1981). The study on
small retailers' buyer behaviour (e.g., Runyan & Droge,
2008) has emerged as an important subset of behav-
ioural research in the developed world. While small
traditional retailers in the developed world have been
struggling for survival against larger organized retail
stores in both urban (Carter, Williams, & Reynolds,
1997) and rural areas (Crank et al., 1995; Phillips &
Swaffin-Smith, 2004), running small shops (traditional
retail) is one of the highest return, non-agricultural
occupations in the rural areas of the developing
countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa (Reardon
et al., 1998).
The importance of rural traditional retailers, in the
context of developing world, has been noted since their
recommendations have a significant bearing on the
initial trial and on the continued usage of a brand or
product (e.g., Aneja, 1993; Dey, Rafat, & Agarwal, 2012;
John & Mishra, 2012; Raj & Selvaraj, 2007). Large organ-
ized stores would probably never enjoy the relation-
ship and the recommendation power of a traditional
rural retailer (Bhandari, 2014; Siddique & Siddique,
2012). Therefore, researchers (e.g., Balakrishnan, 1978;
Kesari & Srivastava, 2012) recommend that marketers
should study the factors that lead to a greater purchase
preference among rural retailers since they determine
the success of a rural marketer.
The purpose of this work is to present an integrative
analysis of the evidence on the purchase preference
factors of rural traditional retailers in developing coun-
tries using published articles on rural marketing, rural
retailers, and related topics. In an attempt to synthesize
the empirical evidence, statistical techniques are used,
since these purchase preference factors are mostly mani-
fested in peripheral inferences of the studies identified.
The present study aims at providing valuable infor-
mation to rural marketers about the areas that need
attention in order to tap into rural markets using rural
retailers. Furthermore, it seeks to develop an analytical
framework of factors influencing purchase preference
of rural tradition retailers along with a ranking of the
importance of each factor.
LITERATURE REVIEW
`A retailer is more like a consumer in what he buys, and
more like an organizational buyer in how he buys his
merchandise'; therefore, a retailer's buying behaviour
is unique (Sheth, 1981, p. 180). A review of conceptu-
alizations of organized retailers supports the view that
a retailer balances rational and personal reasons while
making purchase decisions (an exhaustive review
has been presented by Hansen & Skytte, 1998). While
organizational buying may be a long-winding process
involving multiple stakeholders (Chakravarti, 1989;
Mehta et al., 1981), small retailers often make faster
decisions (Pradhan, 2010). Interestingly, Runyan
and Droge (2008), after analysing the contents of 134
research papers on retailers' purchase behaviour,
suggested that researchers tend to focus more on large
organized retailers than on small retailers.
Traditional Retailer Buyer Behaviour Studies in
Mature Markets
Research on traditional retailers in the developed world
is focused on their basic survival and the challenges
pertaining to their survival (Carter et al., 1997). Studies
conducted in the Western developed world also delve
into strategies being adopted by traditional retailers to
fight large organized retailers (Shaw & Gibbs, 1999). The
spatial competitiveness of chains has proved disruptive
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2016 11
to independent stores in rural areas of the developed
world (Alexander, Benson, & Shaw, 1999). Davies and
Itoh (2001) investigate the effects of legislature on the
decreasing number of small retail outlets. The situa-
tion, in terms of decreasing numbers of rural retailers,
is even worse in rural areas (Hildebrandt, 1987).
Traditional Retailer Buyer Behaviour Studies in
Rural Areas of Developed World
Small retail shops in smaller towns and rural areas have
been exposed to an increasing competition from large
shopping centres and supermarkets in larger cities
(Guy, 1990). The unfaithfulness towards local stores in
rural areas, owing to availability of better range and
lower prices at large organized retailers, has resulted in
an increasing erosion of smaller rural shops (Crank et
al., 1995; Phillips & Swaffin-Smith, 2004). Such a devel-
opment is also evident in rural markets of Sweden,
where this disloyalty has been caused by changes that
include increased car owning, resulting in increased
mobility and out-shopping in urban centres (Forsberg,
1998). Researchers from the Western world have shown
that when the local population falls below a particular
threshold, marginal revenue from rural retail activities
falls below a threshold value, leading to shop closures
(Bresnahan & Reise, 1991; Shonkwiler & Harris, 1996).
Additionally, it has been shown that the arrival of
large retailers in towns relatively closer to small towns
and rural communities often accelerate the demise of
retailers in these communities in developed countries
(Goetz & Swaminathan, 2006; Artz & Stone, 2006).
In contrast to the above observations for rural tradi-
tional retailing in economically developed countries,
running small shops (traditional retail) is one of the
highest return, non-agricultural occupations in rural
areas of developing countries in Latin America, Asia,
and Africa (Reardon et al., 1998).
Traditional Retailer Buyer Behaviour Studies in
Rural Areas of Developing Countries
Although rural retail consists of firms, limited in size
and often located in remote places, they are the corner-
stones of the local economy (Tolbert, Lyson, & Irwin,
1998). Sociological studies in the rural areas of Latin
America indicate that the `nucleus' of rural community
invariably consists of `one or two tiny shops' (Wolfe,
1966). A similar study in the Chinese context found
that consumers are not used to travelling from their
homes to big branded stores or malls (Elg, Ghauri, &
Tarnovskaya, 2008).Astudy conducted in LatinAmerica
suggested that traditional rural shopkeepers, with their
limited shelf space, are in stronger positions than organ-
ized retailers when they negotiate with suppliers (Díaz,
Lacayo, & Salcedo, 2007). This view for rural parts of
Latin America seems to be in contrast with the reality
in developed countries where traditional retailers are
being forced to shut down owing to the advent of large
organized retailers (Hildebrandt, 1987).
Despite being fragmented, rural retailers have consid-
erable influence, since shop layouts do not allow
consumers to browse (Dawar & Chattopadhyay, 2000).
Siddique and Siddique (2012) observed that many MNC
footwear giants started with exclusive stores and later
realized that they did not enjoy much brand equity in
rural markets, and to capture the market share in rural
India, they had to go to the local shoe sellers. It has also
been suggested that rural retailer plays a unique role as
advisor, family friend, and micro creditor (Preeti, 2011).
John and Mishra (2012) suggested that a rural retail-
er's relation with consumers was based on an under-
standing of their needs and buying habits, and was
cemented by the retailer's extension of credit. Neuwirth
(2012) had noted that due to their proximity in the local
community, consumers and rural retail shop owners
often formed close relationships, further cementing the
power of the retailer in product recommendation. In
India, data on rural consumer buying behaviour indi-
cate that the rural retailer influences 35 per cent of the
purchase occasions (Kesari & Srivastava, 2012; Khaled,
2010). The recommendations of the rural retailer have a
significant bearing on the initial trial rate and usage of
a brand (Aneja, 1993). This is important as the number
of items stocked by the rural retail store is lower than
the urban retail store--on the average, the number of
product categories stocked by a rural store is 19, while
in an urban store, it is 27 (Das Munshi, 2005). Rural
shopkeeper's recommendation is a significant factor
in purchase decisions of rural consumers in India (Dey,
Rafat, & Agarwal, 2012; Sulekha & Mor, 2013). Alur
and Schoormans (2013) suggested that considering
the endogenous and exogenous factors that influenced
retailers' purchase decisions would make product
introduction decisions successful.
It appears that marketers in developing countries
cannot borrow from the models of the developed
world, since the available literature on rural retailers
in the developed world is related to the concepts
of central market place theory (study of the impor-
tance and influence of geographical location of rural
12 PURCHASE PREFERENCE FACTORS FOR TRADITIONAL RURAL RETAILERS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL CONCEPTUAL STUDY
markets, e.g., Amanor-Boadu, 2009; Christaller, 1966),
out-shopping behaviour of rural consumers (rural
consumers shopping at nearby market towns or
at larger discount stores, e.g., Kim & Stoel, 2010;
Sullivan & Savitt, 1997), or the phenomenon of
declining number of traditional rural retailers (e.g.,
Artz & Stone, 2006; Hildebrandt, 1987). Therefore,
the review indicates the importance of developing
specific concepts on traditional retailers located
in developing nations. Hence, researchers (e.g.,
Balakrishnan, 1978; Kesari & Srivastava, 2012) recom-
mend that marketers should study the purchase behav-
iour of rural retailers in the context of developing
countries, since the `motivation and attitude' of retailers
(Agadi & Paramashivaiah, 1995, p. 32) determine
the success of rural marketing efforts. Indeed, `rural
marketing' has emerged as an important area of study
in the developing world, owing to the recent `boom in
consumption' in rural markets (Kashyap, 2012) and
also because rural traditional retailers are the conduits
for accessing these markets (Balakrishnan, 1978).
Rural Marketing
`Rural marketing' seemingly originated as a sepa-
rate subject in a seminal paper by Skinner (1964) that
analysed rural marketing in China. Beginning in
agricultural marketing (e.g., Ram, 1984; Shah, 1947), rural
marketing as a subject has evolved to include marketing
of consumer goods (e.g., Dannhaeuser, 1987; Jha, 1988),
developmental marketing (e.g., Pankaj, 2005; Rao &
Tagat, 1985; Vaswani et al., 2005), and holistic marketing
(Jha, 2012). The evolution of rural marketing from
agricultural marketing, with commodity and institu-
tional focus, to a more comprehensive three-dimensional
perspective of rural to urban, urban to rural, and rural
to rural focus, in terms of flow of goods, services, and
ideas, to a developmental perspective with focus on the
poor and vulnerable, is presented by Modi (2009) and
by Jha (2012). Since rural traditional retailers are
important for rural marketers, it is important to under-
stand what factors affect purchase preference among this
class of retailers.
FACTORS INFLUENCING PURCHASE PREFERENCE
OF TRADITIONAL RURAL RETAILERS
To identify the factors from literature, we develop
certain propositions that can be used to categorize
themes on traditional rural retailers. These proposi-
tions are meant to help in categorization of relevant
content from the available literature (as is the accepted
methodology in content-analytic studies, e.g., Verbeke,
Volgering, & Hessels, 1998).
Transactions between rural retailers and marketers
often begin with the actual delivery of products and
services--if the product can be delivered to the outlets,
it would not only save transportation cost and travel
time to feeder towns, but also ensure that the retailer
would prefer to stock door-delivered products (Baig,
1980). Reddy (1996) had gone as far as to suggest that
governments should subsidize the delivery of consumer
goods to rural retailers by providing transportation
subsidies or tax concessions to rural marketers. Studies
in the context of developing nations in Africa (e.g.,
Olamigoke & Emmanuel, 2013) highlight the value
of doorstep delivery of goods and even the value of a
good road transportation network for rural economy.
Thus, the proposition that follows is:
P
1
: Doorstep delivery positively influences purchase pref-
erence of rural traditional retailers.
However, doorstep delivery itself may not help if it is
not combined with the regularity or frequency needed
to promote a brand and also if retailers are not assured
of continuous supplies (Balakrishnan, 1978). Marketers
should appoint wholesalers to service smaller villages,
wherever direct delivery appears to be an uneconom-
ical proposition (Narsimham, 1995). Regular service
appears to be a requirement that is different from door-
step delivery, since doorstep delivery may not imply
regular delivery. The consequent proposition, there-
fore, is:
P
2
: Regular/frequent service is an influencing factor that
is different from doorstep delivery, and this factor also
positively influences purchase preference of rural tradi-
tional retailers.
Appointment of distributors in villages and nearby
towns would be advisable so that rural outlets can be
managed in such a way that goods are made conven-
iently available to consumers (Verma, 1980). Research
shows that rural retailers prefer delivery and service by
local distributors or wholesalers over national distribu-
tion houses or distributors operating from urban centres
(Olamigoke & Emmanuel, 2013). It has been suggested
that distributors should be appointed in feeder towns to
service retailers in surrounding villages--such appoint-
ment of local distributors can help tap uncovered rural
areas (Reddy, 1996). The resultant proposition is:
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2016 13
P
3
: Rural traditional retailers prefer local suppliers.
Apart from delivery and service frequency, studies
(e.g., Jasim & Murali, 2013; Kilaru, 1994, as cited
in Velayudhan, 2007, p. 178) have also indicated
that rural retailers are motivated to stock and sell a
brand if a company provides them relatively higher
margins and commissions compared to other compa-
nies selling similar products. The proposition that
follows is:
P
4
: Rural traditional retailers prefer selling brands
which afford them higher margins and commissions.
Marketers also often provide for discount schemes for
retailers in rural markets to build relations (Sabura,
Vijaykumar,&Hameed,2012).Kilaru(1994)highlighted
the positive impact of discount schemes by observing
that festival discounts given by the manufacturers to
rural retailers normally contribute to increasing stock
levels in the shops (as cited in Velayudhan, 2007, p.
178). It is thus proposed:
P
5
: Availability of discount schemes influences traditional
rural retailers' purchase preference.
Rural retailers are motivated by quantity purchase
discounts, which is a special kind of discount scheme,
that is, progressively higher discounts for higher
volume or value of purchases by a retailer (Jasim &
Murali, 2013). Sabura et al. (2012) emphasized upon
the significance of schemes to push up sales quanti-
ties to rural retailers. Bhattacharjee (2014) also affirms
that rural retailers are motivated by discount schemes
provided by marketers on lifting relatively large quan-
tity of goods. It is, therefore, proposed that:
P
6
: Traditional rural retailers prefer to purchase goods for
whichtheygethigherpercentagediscountsonpurchasing
larger quantities, that is, quantity-based discounts.
Marketers often have to keep the number of retailers
limited to prevent them from competing with each
other by passing on their margins and discounts
to consumers (selling below recommended retail
prices)--this phenomenon is termed `undercut-
ting' (Zhu & Liu, 2011). Limiting the number of rural
retailers, to whom stocks are supplied, prevents under-
cutting and improves their margin (Kilaru, 1994, as
cited in Velayudhan, 2007, p. 178). The proposition that
emerges is:
P
7
: Rural traditional retailers patronize suppliers who
prevent undercutting, that is, prevent retailers from selling
atbelowrecommendedretailpricestoensureprofitability.
However, despite good service, a rural traditional
retailer is often unable to carry stocks without credit
facility from suppliers (Siddique & Siddique, 2012). A
study (Reardon & Berdegue, 2002), conducted in Latin
America, highlighted the immense financial burden
on rural retailers, since they provided credit to rural
consumers (a practice that has stopped in urban areas)--
this induces a need for supplier credit. Credit facility to
rural retailers is necessary to get them to stock and sell
a marketer's products (Sabura et al., 2012). Thus, the
following proposition is developed:
P
8
: Credit from suppliers is a purchase preference factor
for rural traditional retailers, owing to their propensity
to provide downstream credit to rural consumers.
An alternative to suppliers providing credit to retailers
is the provision of credit lines from banks for stocking
of goods (Kremer et al., 2013). Rao (1973) highlighted
the challenge faced by rural dealers, owing to the lack
of banking facilities in many villages. Owing to the lack
of adequate banking facilities and the resultant lack of
credit lines, retailers in rural areas are often unable to
carry adequate stocks (Reddy, 1996). This discussion
leads to the following proposition:
P
9
: Traditional rural retailers prefer purchasing from
companies or suppliers that arrange banking support, that
is, credit lines from banks for rural traditional retailers.
Margins, discount schemes, and credit have a direct
bearing on the return of investment of a retailer
(Fairhurst & Fiorito, 1990). Rural retailers demonstrate
a subsistence-type business orientation--they seem to
be content with a small profit as long as it covers their
subsistence needs (Viswanathan, 2007). It has often
been suggested that a retailer bases his purchase and
stocking decisions on the expected profit he can earn
from that specific purchase (Ramanathan, 2006; Sezen,
2004). Two interesting sub-propositions follow:
P
10
: (a) The viability of selling a brand should cover for
subsistence need of a retailer, with least investment
of capital.
(b) Purchases are preferably made from suppliers
who ensure viability through sufficient margins,
14 PURCHASE PREFERENCE FACTORS FOR TRADITIONAL RURAL RETAILERS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL CONCEPTUAL STUDY
schemes, and credit, since all these ensure returns on
invested capital.
Rural retailers also need to be equipped with informa-
tion about products and trained on marketing prin-
ciples so that they can promote brands and products
(Nyamulinda, Ganesan, & Musonera, 2009; Sulekha &
Mor, 2013). Singh (2011) indicated that the major source
of consumer information was a shop in the trading
areas. Rural retailers need to improve their survival
and continuance by building reciprocal relationships
with the community and consumers, and they can
do so by seeking training to improve their marketing
strategies (Jackson & Stoel, 2011). Sayulu and Reddy
(1998) suggested that rural retailers provided charac-
teristics of products to rural consumers. Pradhan (2010)
presented a decision heuristic for rural retailers on the
basis of information availability. The set of propositions
that follow is:
P
11
: Rural traditional retailers need information and training
(a) toimprovetheirownsellingskillstoruralconsumers
and
(b) to fulfil rural consumers' need for information.
Rural retailers can often do without information and
training if they stock high-demand products, which
rural consumers are familiar with (Bhatia & Bawa,
2002). In a study of traditional rural retailer behav-
iour with respect to selected non-durable goods in
Nuagaon block, in Sundargarh district of Orissa,
India, Kar and Das (2008) observed that rural retailers
often avoided stocking goods that were not highly
demanded, owing to their lack of capital. While
a high variance in assortment composition may
help retailers gain operational efficiencies, it often
increases the likelihood of a loss of sales in a product
or service segment because of an absence of the
preferred (high-demand) brands (Amine & Cadenat,
2003). From this review of literature on the demand
factor, the following may be proposed:
P
12
: Consumer demand for a product or brand may be a
factor in purchase preference of rural traditional retailers.
The quality of products may be an antecedent to the
rural demand for a brand (Prajapati & Thakor, 2012).
Hence, it has been suggested that retailers are moti-
vated to sell higher quality products and brands (Jasim
& Murali, 2013). The subsequent proposition is:
P
13
: Traditional rural retailers prefer purchasing stocks
that are of a higher perceived quality.
It has been observed that the appointment of
educated, unemployed villagers as salesmen for
their own villages would help in better execution of
specific strategies meant to ensure purchase prefer-
ence among rural traditional retailers (Khan & Khan,
2012). Placement of locally selected company staff
would help fulfil the requirements of rural sales force
(identified by Reddy, 1996)--salespeople in rural areas
should be acquainted with the local rural culture and
should speak the local language. Bhattacharjee (2014)
indicated the positive impact of visits by company
representatives on the traditional rural retailers on the
basis of a study of 60 retailers spread over four villages
around the city of Guwahati in India. Viswanathan
(1972, p. 10) had also included `selection of field force'
in his list of six tasks in `rural marketing'. Hence, the
final proposition is as follows:
P
14
: Placement of locally recruited salesmen, who are
aware of the local language and traditions, has a posi-
tive influence on purchases by traditional rural retailers.
METHODOLOGY
Sampling Design and Data Gathering
The sampling method used was a systematic citation
index search using a combination of the phrases such
as `developing nations', `rural marketing', `retailer',
`shop', and `outlet'. A further attempt was made to
find all available literature on the subject by system-
atically checking citations in each source to identify
further sources. Thirty-three sources were picked
up and the complete texts of all these sources were
analysed. The sources used for content analysis are
presented in Table 1. They are classified into three
periods to ensure nearly equal number of sources
in each period. Phrases within the complete texts of
these sources, which indicate the factors of purchase
preference of rural traditional retailers, are grouped
into 14 categories corresponding to the 14 identified
propositions, for example, phrases like `delivery at
doorstep', `retailer prefers supplier visiting him', or
`retailer would not go to wholesaler in feeder town
if he gets stocks delivered to him' indicate the cate-
gory corresponding to the proposition, P
1
, `doorstep
delivery'. This categorization constitutes the basis for
this research.

Source: Literature with inferences about purchase preference factors of rural traditional retailers is grouped into time periods as part of the
present study, in order to have nearly equal number of sources in each period. The class intervals have been fixed with a view to distribute the
papers evenly in terms of the accumulated work. The selection of four studies from 2011 has caused the minor skew.
Some of the papers (e.g., Bhattacharjee, 2014; Jasim &
Murali, 2013; Kar & Das, 2008) are specifically on the
subject of rural retailers, while the rest suggest the
possible factors of traditional rural retailer purchase
preference as peripheral findings. This collection of
`phrases', categorized into 14 groups, constitutes the
basis for this research.Acontent analysis begins with the
assumption that the number of terms or phrases used in
the reviewed literature can be classified into a smaller
number of categories because of similarities in meaning.
This classification was also verified with experts in the
field of rural marketing through in-depth interviews.
Principal Component Analysis
A categorical PCA (CATPCA method for categorical
data using SPSS 21.0) was conducted, using a tabula-
tion of the identified categories, to trace the conceptual
core and the clusters. Various researchers (Kassarjian,
1977; Namenwirth, 1967) have used principal compo-
nents analysis (PCA) to identify relationships between
the categories in different contexts. A casual reading
of the text does not reveal the clusters, for example, an
analysis of literature pertaining to Human Resource
Management practices across Europe showed that the
conceptual core of employee satisfaction is `control over
one's job' since three basic themes emerge as a cluster
during PCA, namely, `able to choose or change order
of tasks', `able to choose or change methods of work',
and `able to choose or change speed/rate of work'
(Ferreira, 2012, p. 147). Similarly, a content analysis of
literature on customer roles in value creation threw up
five clusters that denoted the five conceptual cores in the
sampled studies (Moeller et al., 2013).
The statistical technique of PCA for categorical data is
CATPCA. The goal of PCA is to reduce an original set
of variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated compo-
nents that represent most of the information found in
the original variables (Muelman & Heiser, 2012). The
technique is most useful when the presence of a large
number of variables prohibits effective interpretation
of the relationships between objects (subjects and units).
By reducing the dimensionality, we may interpret
a few components rather than a large number of vari-
ables (ibid.). Standard PCA assumes linear relation-
ships between numeric variables. On the contrary, the
optimal-scaling approach, used in CATPCA, allows vari-
ables to be scaled at different levels. Categorical variables
are optimally quantified in the specified dimensionality.
As a result, nonlinear relationships between variables
can be modelled (ibid.). With CATPCA, it is, therefore,
possible to summarize the links between categories in a
multi-dimensional space. This space is very useful to
revealassociationsbetweendifferentcategories(clusters).
CATPCAwas run on the data (using SPSS 21.0) with each
source being a separate case and each category being a
separate variable (taking values of `1', denoting presence
of a category/theme in a source or `2', denoting absence
of a category/theme in a source). The goal of PCA is the
dimension reduction of the original set of variables into
a smaller set of uncorrelated components that charac-
terize most of the information represented in the original
variables. The technique is valuable when occurrence of
a large number of variables prohibits effective interpre-
tation of the relationships between themes prevalent in
literature on any particular topic. With CATPCA, it is,
therefore, possible to summarize the links between cate-
gories in a multi-dimensional space.
16 PURCHASE PREFERENCE FACTORS FOR TRADITIONAL RURAL RETAILERS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL CONCEPTUAL STUDY
Such an analysis reveals the clusters of themes, as mani-
fested in studied literature, on any topic for which a
content analytic study is conducted. A secondary check
for the existence of such clusters (denoting a conceptual
core in a topic) is performed to check whether clusters
of related categories can be found in similar concepts in
at least one research paper that is not used (to prevent
cyclic conclusions) during the content-analysis process.
The revealed clusters help in presenting a discussion
that is well grounded in available literature.
ANALYSIS, INTERPRETATION, AND RESULTS
The most important categories of words/phrases
identified through the content-analysis process were
separated and summarized. Table 2 shows the frequen-
cies of appearance of each category in the sampled
literature. A count of the number of sources, where
a category (representing a factor of purchase prefer-
ence) occurs even once, is considered as the category
frequency (only one occurrence per source is counted),
for example, the first row of Table 2 suggests that the
regular/frequent service category occurred in 16 of the
33 sources used in the content analysis.

Exploratory Analysis
While a spatial analysis of categories may reveal patterns
in what authorities feel about rural retailer purchase
preference, a temporal analysis enables a study of
evolution of concepts in rural retailer purchase prefer-
ence from the lens of researchers. Some existing studies
(e.g., Furrer, Thomas, & Goussevskaia, 2008; Järvelin &
Vakkari, 1993) suggest the use of a temporal method of
content analysis to trace the evolution of management
concepts.
In Table 3, the categories of the purchase preference
factors of traditional rural retailers have been classi-
fied for different periods of time. As far as ordering in
time is concerned, the time period has been classified
into three nearly equal periods, starting with the first
research work of Rao (1973) and ending with the last
research work by Bhattacharjee (2014).
In Table 3, the categories of purchase preference factors
for traditional rural retailers in developing nations are
ranked for different periods of time, on the basis of
frequency of occurrence of each of the factor in sampled
literature within the periods of study (only one occur-
rence per source is counted). The higher the frequency
of occurrence of a factor, the higher is the rank assigned
to it within that period. The ranks are more important
than the frequencies in order to judge the primacy of
purchase preference factors, as stated by authorities,
over a 40-year period. The ranks reflect the primacy of
a factor in studies conducted in that period. Figure 1
depicts the longitudinal changes in frequencies in the
form of an area graph, with the factor depicted on the
leftmost side being the one with the highest overall
frequency and the rightmost being the factor with the
lowest overall frequency. The need for information and
training on new products and their selling techniques
seem to have maintained the same significance (third
rank) throughout the study period--this implies that
traditional rural retailers have always felt the unwa-
vering need for information and training. The need
for discounts has also maintained almost a uniform
ranking over the period of study (elevating by one
rank only in the second period). There is also a rela-
tive stability in the need for regular/frequent service.
Doorstep delivery has had the highest ranking in the
first period, which is probably owing to the relative
weakness of delivery systems during the early phase
of rural marketing. The requirement for credit seems to
increase from the first period to the second period (rank
5 to rank 1) and then decrease in the third period (from
rank 1 to rank 3). The factor of margin and commission
seems highly ranked only in the second period. For rest
of the factors, no valid temporal pattern can possibly be
stated with certainty.

18 PURCHASE PREFERENCE FACTORS FOR TRADITIONAL RURAL RETAILERS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL CONCEPTUAL STUDY
Justification of Using a Dimension Reduction
Method
For retailer purchase preference factors, the CATPCA
in two dimensions yielded eigen values of 2.864 and
2.688 (as shown in Table 4). The eigen value for a
dimension should be, in general, higher than 1 or the
number of variables. In the analysis of retailer purchase
preference factors, both dimensions have an eigen
value higher than 0.065 (1/16 variables). The total
Chronbach's alpha derived from this dimension
reduction technique is 0.883 (shown in Table 4), which
is higher than the minimum 0.7 value suggested by
Lance, Butts, and Michels (2006). In the CATPCA, the
default number of two dimensions was used. It was
also checked whether three or more dimensions could
be distinguished. However, the available case data did
not substantiate three or more dimensions. Muelman
and Heiser (2012) recommended keeping the number of
dimensions small to make meaningful interpretations
of the clusters possible. Approximately 40 per cent of
the total variance is explained by the two dimensions
(Table 4), which is considered acceptable when using
dimension reduction techniques for content analysis
using categorical data (as suggested for CATPCA by
Buijzen & Valkenburg, 2004; Campos-Herrera et al.,
2008). The total variance explained is the summation of
variances explained by each dimension.

Component loadings were calculated for the categories
in the analysis. The component loadings are basically
the Pearson correlations between the quantified vari-
ables and the dimensions (see Table A1 for correlation
matrices between categories). The component loadings
of the categories placed in a two-dimensional diagram
provide a visual means for interpretation. Categories
that fit into the same cluster will have a similar loading
on a dimension, while categories that do not fit into the
same cluster will have loadings that are dissimilar.
Determining Core Concept and Clusters for
Purchase Preference Factors
Figure 2 presents the factor loadings of each cate-
gory of traditional rural retailer purchase preference
factors to the two dimensions--a relatively higher
loading on a dimension implies that the dimension is
represented relatively better by the factor and a rela-
tively lower loading on a dimension implies that the
dimension is represented relatively modestly by the
factor. On the first dimension (the horizontal axis),
margin and commission (­0.58), prevention of under-
cutting (­0.48), viability (­0.47), discounts (­0.4), high-
quality brands (­0.29), high-demand products/brands
(­0.25), credit (­0.21), information and training need
(­0.19), and high-quality products (­0.09) have nega-
tive component loadings, while the remaining catego-
ries quantity discount schemes (0.22), local company
staff (0.26), local distributor (0.53), doorstep delivery
(0.79), and regular service (0.82) have positive compo-
nent loadings. Hence, the categories with negative
factor loadings, with the exception of information and
communication, seem to collectively indicate the prof-
itability aspect of the retailer. Noticeably, the need
for information and communication has a low magni-
tude of negative loading. The categories with positive
factor loadings, with the exception of quantity discount
scheme, seem to collectively indicate the localization
aspect. In any case, the category of quantity discount
schemes has a very low positive factor loading. Owing
to the loadings of these categories, this dimension can
be possibly named as profitability versus localization
dimension. This is because the categories with negative
loadings are possibly related to the profitability of the
traditional rural retailer, whereas the categories with
positive loadings within the first dimension are possibly
related to the localization pursuit by marketers.
On the second dimension (the vertical axis), the cate-
gories information and training need (­0.37) and
high-quality brands (­0.15) have negative factor load-
ings, while the rest of the categories--viability (0.02),
prevention of undercutting (0.13), doorstep delivery
(0.15), local distributor (0.24), regular service (0.36),
local company staff (0.42), high-demand products/
brands (0.43), credit (0.47), margin and commission
(0.57), high-quality products (0.58), discounts (0.68),
and quantity discount schemes (0.78)--have positive
factor loadings. In the second dimension, the higher
positive loadings are for discounts and quantity
discount schemes and the negative loading is low for
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2016 19
high-quality brands. Therefore, the second dimension
can be possibly named as gross margin.

Once the dimensions have been determined, the core
concepts and the different clusters can be determined. A
factor loading of around 0.3 or above on both dimensions
(in a two-dimensional solution) indicates a cross-loading
in content-analysis studies (Verbeke et al., 1998)--this
research uses a similar benchmark. There is a substan-
tial overlap among some categories as seen from the
cross-loadings that run across the two dimensions as can
be seen through a visual examination of the factors' load-
ings presented under the graph in Figure 2. The main
overlapsareinthecategoriesofregularservice,discounts,
and margins and commissions. In a minor way, there is
overlap in quantity discount schemes, credit, local distrib-
utor, local company staff, and high-demand products and
brands. These overlaps suggest the possible vestiges of a
conceptual framework of a set of factors needed to moti-
vate retailers to stock and sell products and brands--a
framework that rural marketers need to understand and
evoke while planning and implementing rural marketing
strategies. Thus, while CATPCA creates two dimensions,
there appears substantial overlap among the categories
across the dimensions. Hence, we can possibly conclude
that traditional rural retailer purchase preference requires
a set of factors that marketers have to ensure.
From the factor loadings for the two dimensions, some
clusters can be discerned. High-demand products and
brands, and credit form one cluster--both have close
levels of loadings for dimension 1 as well as dimen-
sion 2 and can be visually discerned if a graphical plot
is made of the values in two axes. Doorstep delivery
and regular service form a second cluster. It will also
be checked if these clusters reflect exact content from
conclusions in at least one research paper that is
not used (to prevent cyclic conclusions) during the
content-analysis process.
Based on the analysis using CATPCA, as presented in
Figure 2, it is found that there is a core concept and a
set of clusters, which represents conceptual variations
around the core concept. This core concept of traditional
rural purchase preference factors include the overlap-
ping categories of regular service, discounts, margins
and commissions, quantity discount schemes, credit,
local distributor, local company staff, and high-demand
products and brands. Therefore, the core purchase pref-
erence factors of traditional rural retailers can be identi-
fied as these overlapping categories of regular service,
discounts, margins and commissions, quantity discount
schemes, credit, local distributor, local company staff,
and high-demand products and brands.
20 PURCHASE PREFERENCE FACTORS FOR TRADITIONAL RURAL RETAILERS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL CONCEPTUAL STUDY
CATPCA has yielded two discernible clusters, as seen
in Figure 2. High-demand products and brands, and
credit form one cluster. Doorstep delivery and regular
service form a second cluster. If the clusters, which
emerge during the content analysis of factors of tradi-
tional rural retailer purchase preference, reflect exact
content from conclusions in at least one article that
is not used (to prevent cyclic conclusions) during the
content-analysis process, it would imply that there
is a conceptual core to the academic thought on the
subject (as suggested by, Verbeke et al., 1998). Some
conclusions in relatively recent studies (not included as
part of content analysis to prevent cyclic error) about
the purchase preference factors of traditional rural
retailers are presented here, which correspond to the
clusters that emerged:
(There is a) reluctance on the part of the semi-wholesalers
and wholesalers to give more quantities (at a single purchase
instance, indicating High Demand Products and Brands)
to the rural retailer as they would not be sure if the retailer
would come back to them for the next purchase, the sale
being mostly on credit. (Aithal, 2012, p. 212)
The Shakti entrepreneur (HUL's rural distributor based
in village) offers personalized service, doorstep delivery,
and an assurance of quality to rural retailers. (Rangan &
Rajan, 2007, p. 15)
All possible efforts should be made to make the products
available at the doorstep of the target audience ... a strong
distribution system, which helps brands reach the interiors
of the rural market. (Saini, 2014, pp. 145­146)
This reflection of clusters in inferences present in
research papers, which are not part of the statistical
content analysis, substantiates the conclusion that
studies pertaining to purchase preference factors of
rural traditional retailers have a conceptual core.
DISCUSSION
The objective of this study is to identify the factors
that motivate traditional rural retailers in devel-
oping nations and to conceptualize a hierarchy of
those needs based on a quantitative content analysis
using statistical techniques. Rural retailers appear
as the key influencer of rural sales and scholars and
marketers feel the need to understand this entity
better. Many authors have made conclusions about
rural retailers while studying other aspects of rural
marketing, but dedicated studies on traditional rural
retailers in developing nations are rare and gener-
ally constrained by their width of study (all study
less than 100 retailers or focus on products from a
single company or are very qualitative in nature).
This indeed makes a search for content difficult but
these papers do provide a starting point for a serious
and more extensive study of rural retailers. This is
the first attempt to conceptualize the purchase pref-
erence factors for a traditional rural retailer using
statistical methods.
Conceptual Core of Academic Thought on
Traditional Rural Retailers' Purchase Preference
Factors
The result from CATPCA suggests a conceptual core for
the factors that influence a rural retailer's propensity
to stock and sell a marketer's brands and products.
These accepted core factors indicate that a traditional
rural retailer can possibly be persuaded to purchase
high-demand products and brands, through the provi-
sion of credit, discounts, quantity discount schemes,
margins and commissions, using local distributor
(based in village itself) and company staff, who should
provide regular service.
CATPCA has yielded two discernible clusters: High-
demand products and brands and credit; and doorstep
delivery and regular service. The clusters that emerge
during the content analysis of factors of traditional
rural retailer purchase preference reflect exact content
from conclusions in at least one research paper that
is not used (to prevent cyclic conclusions) during the
content-analysis process. This confirms that researchers
have been moving on similar lines in their conceptual-
izations of the purchase preference factors of traditional
rural retailers. This makes it easier for further research
to be conducted using the categories/themes identified
in this research.
Identifying the Evolution of Studies on Traditional
Rural Retailers' Purchase Preference
This research also presents a longitudinal analysis of
the categories over a period of 40 years. Traditional
rural retailers have always felt the unwavering need
for information and training. The need for discounts
has also maintained almost a uniform ranking over the
period of study. There is also a relative stability in the
need for regular/frequent service. Doorstep delivery
had the highest ranking in the first period, which is
probably owing to the relative weakness of delivery
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2016 21
systems during the early phase of rural marketing. The
requirement for credit seems to increase from the first
period to the second period and then decreases in the
third period. The factor of margins and commissions
seems highly ranked only in the second period. For rest
of the factors, no valid temporal pattern can possibly be
discerned with certainty.
LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY
This study, however, has some limitations. First, it may
have left out some research papers and books of minor
importance, since a systematic citation search method
has been used as the sampling method. The result
may be made more robust by including more content
on traditional rural retailer. Second, the categorization
of factors and the propositions postulated are based
on judgemental calls by the experts consulted. Some
judgemental errors may have crept in while catego-
rizing the terms found in literature.
Since this study is based on literature relevant to devel-
oping nations, it may not be applicable to mature
markets. There may be some more factors that are impor-
tant determinants of purchase decisions by traditional
rural retailers and these may have got left out since the
sampled studies have not mentioned these factors.
MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS
The 14 factors that are presented in this study may
possibly guide rural marketers in designing and
implementing rural marketing strategies. Since tradi-
tional rural retailers form the conduit for marketers
to reach rural consumers, it follows that an under-
standing of the factors influencing rural retailers in
stocking and selling decisions would help a marketer
in tapping into rural markets. The ranking of the
factors also provides some idea about the importance
of each of these factors, since a larger number of
studies stressing on a particular factor generally
imply a greater significance of that particular factor
(as suggested in a similar study by Verbeke et al.,
1998). The clusters discerned through PCA imply
that regular service at doorsteps of rural, tradi-
tional retailers, and providing credit for high-sales
brands should be important strategic imperatives for
a marketer who is keen to penetrate rural markets
through traditional retailers.
Future studies may use the 14 identified factors of
purchase preference to conduct empirical research on
rural traditional retailers in developing nations. Such
studies may even attempt to build a path diagram to
representpurchasebehaviourofruraltraditionalretailers.
CONCLUSION
This article points out that the research inferences,
made in core as well as peripheral studies, on purchase
preference factors for traditional rural retailers in devel-
oping nations comprise of a conceptual core. Although
researchers have worked on multiple dimensions of
rural marketing in developing nations, investigations
on traditional rural retailers have only been at the
periphery of studies. The aim of this research has been
to analyse possibly all the research conducted on rural
retailers and find out the purchase preference factors of
a rural retailer. Content analysis has been used to find
out the categories of factors influencing the purchase
preference of traditional rural retailers in stocking and
selling goods and services. This article also provides
14 categories of factors that motivate rural retailers,
which would help marketers in planning and imple-
mentation of rural marketing strategies. These 14 cate-
gories can also be used as a starting point for further
empirical research.
