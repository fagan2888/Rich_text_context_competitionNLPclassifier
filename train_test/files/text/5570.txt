Introduction
Accumulating evidence indicates an involvement of
monocytes/macrophages in development of tissue injury
and cardiac dysfunction after myocardial infarction. The
spleen is the largest organ in the lymphatic system and
forms a reservoir containing over half of the body's mono-
cytes besides the bone marrow.1 It has previously been
reported that about 40­70% of monocytes are recruited to
the infarcted myocardium from a splenic reservoir.2 Upon
moving to injured tissue, these monocytes turn into mac-
rophages to contribute to postischemic inflammatory
response and injury. Animal studies have shown that
the extent of myocardial infarction is positively correlated
with the number of macrophages accumulated in the injured
myocardium after coronary occlusion, where macrophages

Abstract
Introduction: The purpose of this study was to determine whether macrophages migrated from the spleen are
associated with angiotensin II-induced cardiac fibrosis and hypertension.
Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to angiotensin II infusion in vehicle (500 ng/kg/min) for up to four weeks.
In splenectomy, the spleen was removed before angiotensin II infusion. In the angiotensin II AT1 receptor blockade,
telmisartan was administered by gastric gavage (10 mg/kg/day) during angiotensin II infusion. The heart and aorta were
isolated for Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry.
Results: Angiotensin II infusion caused a significant reduction in the number of monocytes in the spleen through
the AT1 receptor-activated monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Comparison of angiotensin II infusion, splenectomy
and telmisartan comparatively reduced the recruitment of macrophages into the heart. Associated with this change,
transforming growth factor 1 expression and myofibroblast proliferation were inhibited, and Smad2/3 and collagen I/
III were downregulated. Furthermore, interstitial/perivascular fibrosis was attenuated. These modifications occurred in
coincidence with reduced blood pressure. At week 4, invasion of macrophages and myofibroblasts in the thoracic aorta
was attenuated and expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase was upregulated, along with a reduction in aortic
fibrosis.
Conclusions: These results suggest that macrophages when recruited into the heart and aorta from the spleen
potentially contribute to angiotensin II-induced cardiac fibrosis and hypertension.

produce multiple cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor ,
platelet derived endothelial cell growth factor, transform-
ing growth factor 1 (TGF1) and interleukin-1 to initiate
inflammation and progression of adverse cardiac remode-
ling.3,4 Clinical observations have also found that mac-
rophage accumulation is closely associated with severe
myocardial injury and poor functional outcome in patients
with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.5­8
It is well known that angiotensin II (Ang II) has profound
effects on cardiovascular diseases acting via its binding to
two main cell surface receptors, AT1 and AT2. Ang II sign-
aling has been associated with development of deleterious
tissue repair after myocardial infarction through regulating
monocyte motility and release from the splenic reservoir.2 In
a mouse model of permanent coronary occlusion, enalapril,
an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, reduced
the release of monocytes from the spleen and subsequently
inhibited the recruitment of monocytes into the infarct site.
This inhibition in macrophage accumulation in ischemic
myocardium was reproduced by splenectomy.9 In this
regard, we have recently reported that four weeks of con-
tinuous administration of Ang II to rats enhances mac-
rophage accumulation and myofibroblast proliferation in
the myocardium, which was significantly inhibited by an
AT1 receptor blocker, telmisartan. Consequently, deposition
of collagen in perivascular coronary vessels and interstitial
myocardium was attenuated. In that study, we found that the
extravasation and distribution of macrophages in the myo-
cardium is the most important feature in activation of myofi-
broblast/TGF1/Smads-mediated fibrotic signaling.10
Although previous studies have identified the splenic
reservoir monocytes as a major source of macrophages
that accumulate in the infarcted myocardium,2,9 it is
unknown whether splenic monocytes contribute to Ang
II-induced macrophage accumulation in the myocardium
and subsequent cardiac fibrosis and hypertension. Hence,
the purpose of this study was designed to evaluate whether
splenic release of monocytes participates in Ang II-elicited
cardiac fibrosis and hypertension by modulating the popu-
lation of macrophages in the myocardium and blood vessel
in the in vivo rat model of Ang II infusion. Specifically, the
effects of splenectomy and the AT1 receptor blockade on
monocyte/macrophage recruitment, monocyte chemoat-
tractant protein-1 (MCP-1), TGF1/Smads, collagens and
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were examined
as well as the interstitial/perivascular fibrosis and hyper-
tension were assessed.
Materials and methods
Animals and noninvasive blood pressure
measurement
The animal experimental procedures were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Mercer
University School of Medicine. Male Sprague-Dawley rats
weighing 200±10 g obtained from the Harlan Laboratories,
Indianapolis, Indiana, USA were kept individually in a
12-hour light/dark cycle, 60% humidity and temperature-
controlled room with standard rat chow and water ad libi-
tum. These procedures were in compliance with The Guide
for the Care of Use of Laboratory Animals.11 The blood
pressure was determined in conscious rats using a noninva-
sive blood pressure measuring system (PowerLab, ML125
AD Instruments NIBP controller, Colorado, USA). This
system detects the signals via a pulse transducer during the
periodic occlusion of blood flow in the tail.
Osmotic minipump implantation and
splenectomy
The rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection
of a mixture of ketamine (90 mg/kg) and zylaxine (10 mg/
kg) and implanted subcutaneously with osmotic minipumps
(Model 2004, ALZET Corp, California, USA) in the dorsal
region to deliver Ang II. The pumps were preincubated in
the tubes with 0.9% sterile saline only or saline containing
Ang II at 37ºC overnight prior to implantation. In rats that
received splenectomy, a midline skin incision was made
after the skin was shaved and sterilized with povidone-
iodine and alcohol. The splenic blood vessels were ligated
after the abdominal cavity was made. The spleen was
removed by transecting the vessels just distal to the ligature
and the skin incision was then closed with sutures.
Experimental design and study group
Four weeks of experimental period was selected for all
experimental groups. Five concurrent groups of rats were
randomly assigned: (a) vehicle­infused rats (Sham, n=7):
rats received saline minipump infusion; (b) Ang II-infused
rats (Ang II, n=7): rats received subcutaneous Ang II infu-
sion at a rate of 500 ng/kg/min (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri,
USA); (c) splenectomy+Ang II infusion rats (Splen, n=7):
rats received Ang II infusion at day 2 after splenectomy;
(d) telmisartan+Ang II (Telmi, n=7): telmisartan
(Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ridgefield,
Connecticut, USA) was administered at a dose of 10 mg/
kg/day by gastric gavage starting day 1 after Ang II min-
ipump implantation; (e) splenectomy+telmisartan+Ang II
infusion rats (S+T, n=6): rats received telmisartan by gas-
tric gavage after splenectomy and during Ang II infusion.
At the end of four weeks of the experimental period, the
rats from different groups were euthanized. The hearts and
proximal thoracic aortas were removed.
Western blot analysis of the AT1 receptor,
MCP-1, TGF1, Smads and collagens in the
spleen and myocardium
The freshly-frozen transmural tissue samples from the
spleen and myocardium were homogenized in ice-cold
Wang et al. 3
lysis buffer. Total proteins (60 g) were extracted, frac-
tionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as
described previously.10 The membrane was then incubated
at 4°C overnight with the following antibodies: rabbit anti-
AT1 (1:800) and AT2 (1:400) receptor polyclonal antibod-
ies (Santa Cruz Biotech, Dallas, Texas, USA), a rabbit
anti-MCP-1 polyclonal antibody and a mouse monoclonal
anti-TGF1 antibody (1:1000,Abcam, Inc., Massachusetts,
USA), rabbit anti-phospho-Smad2/3 monoclonal antibod-
ies (1:1000, Cell Signaling, Massachusetts, USA), mouse
anti-collagen type I and III monoclonal antibodies (1:5000,
Sigma Chemical Co., Missouri, USA), respectively. Bound
antibody was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conju-
gated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG)). The mem-
brane was incubated with chemiluminescence detection
reagents and exposed to a X-ray film. The images were
then imported into the ImageJ (National Institute of Health
(NIH), Massachusetts, USA) and quantified as a ratio
based on the density of the target protein band divided by
actin to correct differences during protein loading and/or
transfer.
Immunohistochemical staining of Ang II receptors,
macrophages, myofibroblasts and eNOS in the
spleen, myocardium, and thoracic aorta
All paraffin-embedded tissue sections (4 m thick) were
dewaxed in xylene, and rehydrated through graded alco-
hols as previously reported.10 Briefly, the sections were
incubated overnight with primary antibodies including a
rabbit anti-AT1 receptor polyclonal antibody (1:200, Santa
Cruz Biotech, Dallas, Texas, USA), a mouse anti-rat mon-
oclonal antibody against macrophages (CD68; 1:200,
Millipore, California, USA), a monoclonal antibody
against -smooth muscle actin (SMA; 1:800, Sigma
Chemical Co., Missouri, USA) and a rabbit polyclonal
antibodyagainsteNOS(1:200,Abcam,Inc.,Massachusetts,
USA), respectively. The slides were incubated with a bioti-
nylated horse anti-rabbit IgG or an anti-mouse IgG (Vector
Laboratories, California, USA), stained using the ABC-
peroxidase kit or ABC-AR (alkaline phosphatase; Vector
Laboratories, California, USA) and visualized with
3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride or alkaline
phosphatase substrate kit (Sigma, Missouri, USA). Quality
of immunohistochemistry assay was controlled by either
elimination of the primary antibody or incubation of the
tissue with a non-immune IgG. Sections were counter-
stained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted by
routine methods. The density in expression of the AT1
receptor and eNOS, the accumulation of macrophages and
-SMA­expressing myofibroblasts among groups were
compared using computer-assisted morphometry (ImageJ,
NIH). The final results were reported from the eight rand-
omized high-powered fields.
Masson's trichrome staining of collagen
deposition in the heart and thoracic aorta
The transversal myocardial blocks and proximal thoracic
aorta were fixed in phosphate-buffered formalin solution
and dehydrated in graded series of alcohol, and then
embedded in paraffin as previously reported.10 Samples
were sectioned to a thickness of 6 m using a Microtome
(Leica RM2135, Meyer Instruments, Texas, USA) and
stained by Masson's trichrome method producing colla-
gen blue, nuclei black and muscle fiber red. Ten rand-
omized high-powered fields (HPFs) per tissue section
were evaluated to define the perivascular fibrosis,
expressed as the area of perivascular fibrosis divided by
the area of the vascular wall, i.e. perivascular fibrosis
ratio (PFR).12 The interstitial fibrosis was quantitated as
the positively stained collagen area (i.e. blue staining in
the interstitial myocardium) and expressed as percentage
fibrotic area per HPF. The fibrotic area of thoracic aorta
was visualized by the fibrotic thickness in the adventitia
and calculated as the micrometer per HPF. All histologi-
cal evaluation was performed by a single well-trained
observer using a digital image analyzer (ImageJ, NIH,
Massachusetts, USA).
Statistical analysis
Data were reported as the mean±standard error. A one-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student-
Newman-Keul's post-hoc test was used to analyze group
differences in the intensity of AT1/AT2 receptors, the
populations of macrophages and myofibroblasts, the
expression of TGF1, collagens, and phospho-Smads
using SigmaPlot (Systat Software Inc., California, USA).
Statistical significance was set at a value of p<0.05.
Results
Identification of monocytes and expression of
the AT1 receptor in the red pulp of the spleen
Histological features of the spleen in rat are shown in
Figure 1(a). The spleen is composed of two functionally
and morphologically distinct tissues, the white pulp and
the red pulp. The white pulp regions of the spleen consist
of lymphatic tissue containing T lymphocytes and B lym-
phocytes that are responsible for destroying pathogens in
the blood and producing antibodies. The red pulp makes
up 75% of the volume of the spleen and serves as an
important reservoir for large quantities of phagocytic white
blood cells called monocytes. To further demonstrate the
distribution of monocytes and the expression of the AT1
receptor, we stained the tissue sections of the spleen using
immunohistochemistry. As shown in Figure 1(b), mono-
cytes and the AT1 receptor were predominately localized
and expressed in the red pulp.

Infusion of Ang II increased the protein level
and expression of the AT1 receptor and
reduced the monocyte population in the red
pulp of the spleen
The protein level of the AT1 receptor and its expression in
the red pulp were analyzed using Western blot assay and
immunohistochemistry. As shown in Figure 2(a), infusion
of Ang II for four weeks significantly increased the protein
level of the AT1 receptor relative to the sham group.
Positive immunohistostaining for the AT1 receptor was
found in the red pulp during the course of the experiment in
the sham group but the immunohistostaining intensity of
the AT1 receptor was markedly enhanced with Ang II infu-
sion at week 4 (Figure 2(b)). Consistent with changes in the
AT1 receptor protein and expression, the population of
monocytes in the red pulp was significantly reduced with
Ang II infusion relative to the sham control (Figure 2(c)).
Treatment with telmisartan over four weeks abrogated the
upregulated AT1 receptor. The protein level and expression
of the AT1 receptor were significantly attenuated, coincid-
ing with preserved numbers of monocytes in the red pulp
(Figure 2(c)), suggesting a role of Ang II in the release of
monocytes in the spleen via stimulating the AT1 receptor.
The AT2 receptor was constitutively expressed in the
spleen. Relative to the sham group, the infusion of Ang II
and administration of theAT1 receptor blocker, telmisartan,
did not alter expression of the AT2 receptor (Figure 2(a)).
Blockade of the AT1 receptor reduced the
protein level of MCP-1 in the spleen and
macrophage accumulation in the heart:
comparison to the splenectomy
MCP-1 is a potent chemoattractant specific for monocytes
and known to be associated with monocyte migration.
As shown in Figure 2(d), MCP-1 was constitutively
Figure 1. Detection of monocytes and expression of the AT1 receptor from paraffin-embedded transverse sections in normal rat
spleen. The low-power view in (a) shows the average amount of two types of tissue: the red pulp and white pulp in the parenchyma
of the spleen. The red pulp makes up the majority of the spleen and serves as an important reservoir for large quantities
of phagocytic white blood cells called monocytes. White pulp is lymphatic tissue that mainly consists of lymphocytes called
B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes that surround arteries. Venous sinuses are essentially cavities filled with blood. The presence
of macrophages and expression of the AT1 receptor were confirmed by immunohistochemistry (b). In a higher magnification of
the cross-section, it was found that monocytes are predominantly located within the red pulp, where the positively stained AT1
receptor shown as brown granular pigment was identified. Magnification×400; scale bars: 100 µm (n=6).

expressed in the spleen and significantly increased with
Ang II infusion at week 4, which was consistent with
reduced monocyte populations in the spleen (Figure 2(c)).
To further demonstrate the receptor mechanism underly-
ing how Ang II promoted monocyte migration from the
spleen, we treated the animals using telmisartan, and
found that along with an inhibition of MCP-1 expression
in the spleen, the splenetic monocyte population was also
increased (Figure 2(c)), indicating a role of MCP-1 in
migrating monocytes via the AT1 receptor. To associate
the release of monocytes from the spleen with the mac-
rophage accumulation in the heart, the distribution of
macrophages in the heart after splenectomy and the AT1
blockade was compared. As shown in Figure 3(a), the
number of macrophages was significantly reduced after
splenectomy to a comparable level shown as the number

(MCP-1) level in the spleen during Ang II infusion. Protein levels of the AT1/AT2 receptors (a) and MCP-1 (d) were analyzed using
Western blot and all bands were normalized by actin. Expression of the AT1 receptor (b) and macrophage accumulation (c) were
detected with immunohistochemistry. Macrophage localization was determined by the number of positively-stained cells (brown
granular pigment) in each high-powered field (HPF; original magnification: ×400; scale bars: 100 µm). Sham: rats were infused with a

of macrophages in the heart after the AT1 receptor
inhibition, suggesting that the spleen is the source
of macrophage accumulation in the heart via the AT1
receptor-mediated pathway. Treatment with splenectomy
plus telmisartan did not provide further inhibition of
macrophage accumulation in the heart (Figure 3(a)).

Splenectomy and the AT1 receptor antagonism
reduced TGF1 protein level and inhibited
myofibroblast proliferation in the heart
It is known that the release of TGF1 from macrophages is
capable of stimulating myofibroblast proliferation. To
address whether this is a potential signaling mechanism
involved in inhibition of myofibroblast proliferation in the
heart after splenectomy and the AT1 receptor antagonism,
TGF1 expression and myofibroblast proliferation were
detected using Western blot assay and immunohistochem-
istry. As shown in Figure 3(b), Ang II infusion caused a
significant increase in TGF1 protein level at week 4.
Along with an augmentation in expression of TGF1 pro-
tein, the number of positively-stained -SMA-expressing
myofibroblasts was increased, suggesting a role of TGF1
in myofibroblast proliferation (Figure 3(c)). Splenectomy
before Ang II infusion or treatment with telmisartan over
four weeks reduced the protein level of TGF1 and myofi-
broblast proliferation. No further inhibition in macrophage
accumulation, TGF1 expression, and myofibroblast pro-
liferation was observed when treated with splenectomy
and telmisartan (Figure 3).
Splenectomy and the AT1 receptor antagonism
reduced production of phosph-Smad2/3 and
collagen I/III in the heart
Phosphorylation of Smads stimulates the synthesis of col-
lagens following myofibroblast proliferation. We selected
Smad2 and Smad3 as signaling targets to detect collagen
synthesis using Western blot assay. As shown in Figure 4,
Smad2 and Smad3 were significantly phosphorylated at
week 4 after Ang II infusion, coinciding with enhanced
synthesis of collagen I and III. Splenectomy before Ang II
infusion or treatment with telmisartan over four weeks
reduced phosphorylated levels of Smad2 and Smad3,
which was in compliance with an inhibition of protein lev-
els of collagen I and III. Splenectomy plus administration
of telmisartan during Ang II infusion did not further affect
the protein levels of Smad2/3 and collagen I/III throughout
the experiment (Figure 4).
Splenectomy and the AT1 receptor antagonism
inhibited intermyocardial and perivascular
fibrosis in the heart
The scale of intermyocardial fibrosis and the ratio of
perivascular fibrosis were examined using Masson's tri-
chrome method. Consistent with increased synthesis of
collagens, the production of fibrotic tissue in the inter-
myocardium and perivascular region was augmented with
Ang II infusion. At week 4, percent fibrotic area in the
myocardium (Figure 5(a)) and fibrotic ratio in the perivas-
cular area (Figure 5(b)) were significantly increased at
week 4. Splenectomy before Ang II infusion or treatment
with telmisartan over four weeks significantly reduced the
fibrotic tissue formation induced by Ang II infusion.
Combination of splenectomy plus administration of tel-
misartan during Ang II infusion provided a comparable
inhibition in fibrosis formation in the myocardium and
perivascular region when compared with each individual
intervention (Figure 5).
Splenectomy and the AT1 receptor antagonism
reduced blood pressure, attenuated
macrophage invasion and myofibroblast
proliferation as well as augmented eNOS
expression in the proximal thoracic aorta
Formation of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis is asso-
ciated with an increase in blood pressure. As shown in
Figure 6, subcutaneous infusion of Ang II significantly
increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) calculated from
systolic/diastolic pressure at week 4 relative to the sham
group (202±8.9 mm Hg vs 98±3.8 mm Hg in the sham
group, p=0.03). Splenectomy before Ang II infusion sig-
nificantly reduced the MAP compared with the Ang II
group (176±12 mm Hg vs 202±8.9 mm Hg in the Ang II
group, p=0.039). The maximal reduction in MAP was
observed throughout the experiment to a comparable
level in the sham group when treated with telmisartan
(97±14 mm Hg vs 98±3.8 mm Hg). There was no statisti-
cal difference in reduction of MAP between splenectomy
plus telmisartan group and telmisartan alone at week 4
(91±18 mm Hg vs 97±14 mm Hg).
Aortic hypertrophy is associated with an elevation in
blood pressure after continuous infusion of Ang II. To fur-
ther explore whether macrophage recruitment to the aorta is
involved in initiation of this process, the proximal thoracic
aorta was stained using immunohistochemistry to detect
the infiltration of macrophages, proliferation of myofibro-
blasts, expression of eNOS and the AT1 receptor. As shown
in Figure 7(a), there were a significantly increased number
of positively stained macrophages in the adventitia and
tunica intima (endothelium) at week 4 relative to the sham
control (7.1±2.3 vs 2.0±0.6/HPF, p=0.032). Consistent with
the presence of macrophages after Ang II infusion, immu-
nohistostaining confirmed proliferation of myofibroblasts
at the perivascular region relative to the sham control
(6.9±1.7 vs 1.7±0.9/HPF, p=0.028, Figure 7(b)). eNOS
expression was constitutively expressed in the endothelium
and tunica media of thoracic aorta in the sham control, but
its expression was markedly downregulated by Ang II infu-
sion at week 4 (Figure 7(c)). As shown in Figure 7(a)­(d),
splenectomy or dietary treatment with telmisartan reduced
the numbers of recruited macrophages (4.0±0.1 and 3.0±0.7
vs 7.1±2.3/HPF in the Ang II group, p=0.038) and prolifer-
ated myofibroblasts (2.8±0.9 and 2.0±1.0 vs 6.9±1.7/HPF
in the Ang II group, p=0.036). In coincidence with these
8 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 00(0)
modifications, eNOS expression on the endothelium and
tunica media was upregulated and the AT1 receptor was
downregulatedbysplenectomyortelmisartan.Furthermore,
the fibrotic thickness in the adventitia, as identified by
Masson's trichrome staining, was reduced relative to the
Ang II group with these interventions (0.7±0.1 µm/HPF in
the splenectomy group and 0.65±0.2 µm/HPF in the tel-
misartan group vs 1.6±0.2 µm/HPF in the Ang II group,
p=0.042, Figure 7(e)). With these improvements, the aortic
wall thickness was reduced in both splenectomy and tel-
misartan groups (312±36 and 303±46 vs 537±36 µm/HPF
in the Ang II group, p=0.04), indicating less smooth muscle
proliferation and medial hypertrophy. These data suggest
that Ang II-induced vascular remolding is associated with
invasion of macrophages into the aortic walls by an AT1
receptor-mediated process. No further modulation in infil-
tration of macrophages, proliferation of myofibroblasts,
expression of eNOS and the AT1 receptor as well as adven-
titial fibrotic area was observed when splenectomy and tel-
misartan treatment were combined relative to each
intervention alone (Figure 7).
Discussion
Recent studies highlight the role of splenic reservoir-
derived monocytes/macrophages in the development of
myocardial infarction and heart failure. In the mouse
model of permanent coronary occlusion, it has been shown
that monocytes clustered in the spleen express the AT1
receptor.2 Monocytes mobilized from the splenic reservoir

into the infarcted myocardium after coronary ligation
impaired the infarct healing and provoked pathological
ventricular remodeling by eliciting potent inflammation.3,4
In this regard, we have recently reported that infusion of
Ang II causes significant tissue fibrosis by producing mac-
rophage accumulation via stimulating the AT1 receptor in
the heart.12 However, we do not know the mechanisms
involved in the recruitment of macrophages. This is the
first study to illustrate that the release of monocytes from
their splenic reservoir to the heart plays an important role
in development of Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis and
hypertension. We demonstrate that, in the normal condi-
tion, monocytes presented in the red pulp of the spleen,
an area extremely rich in macrophages, primarily express
the AT1 receptor. Ang II infusion caused a significant
accumulation of macrophages in the heart after the AT1
receptor is activated in the spleen, potentially through acti-
vating MCP-1. Splenectomy or blockade of the AT1 recep-
tor reduced the recruitment of macrophages and the
proliferation of myofibroblasts, followed by an inhibition
of Smads-mediated collagen production and fibrotic tissue
formation. In the proximal thoracic aortic wall, splenec-
tomy or the AT1 receptor blockade inhibited invasion of
macrophages and myofibroblasts, and enhanced eNOS
expression, indicating a role of macrophages in Ang
II-elevated blood pressure.
Infusion of Ang II using an osmotic pump builds a con-
stant plasma concentration of Ang II and allows us to
observe the direct effect of Ang II on tissue injury. We
chose this model of Ang II infusion because it

likely reproduces innate pathological processes during the
development of cardiac fibrosis resulting from myocardial
infarction, hypertension, and heart failure in humans.13,14
In these patients, elevated concentration of Ang II in
plasma and heart has been recognized as a main trigger of
pathogenesis.15 Of note, in the present study, the substan-
tial reduction in accumulation of macrophages in the heart
by splenectomy, which was simulated through inhibiting
the AT1 receptor-mediated process, suggests that there is a
parallel relationship of reduced level of splenic monocytes
and enhanced accumulation of macrophages in the heart.
Splenectomy plus administration of the AT1 receptor
blocker did not show further attenuation in macrophage
accumulation and tissue fibrosis in the heart relative to
each intervention alone, indicating that the maximal pro-
tection through inhibiting macrophage migration can be
achieved either by splenectomy or the AT1 receptor antag-
onism. In this regard, other factors such as production of
reactive oxidant species and inflammatory cytokines in the
heart in addition to recruitment of macrophages may also
participate in Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis.16,17
We have previously shown that blockade of the AT1
receptor has inhibitory effects on myocardial fibrosis and
hypertension through activating the AT2 receptor.10 To
ensure the relative contribution of splenic monocytes to
cardiac fibrosis via the AT1 receptor antagonism, we also
measured expression of the AT2 receptor in the spleen. As
shown in Figure 2, the AT2 receptor is normally expressed
in the spleen, but its expression was not altered by Ang II
infusion and telmisartan, excluding a role of the AT2
receptor in mobilization of splenic monocytes. MCP-1, a
potent mononuclear cell chemoattractant, is reported to be

simultaneous monitoring of the cuff pressure. The arrows indicate systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
Change in blood pressure among groups can be identified by the distance during cuff inflation between the baseline (Base) and
the beginning of SBP tracing. Sham: rats were infused with a saline pump for four weeks; Ang II: rats received Ang II subcutaneous

produced by macrophages, endothelial cells, and myocar-
dium to promote the migration of inflammatory cells. The
available evidence suggests that the induction of MCP-1
in response to Ang II is associated with mobilization of
macrophages through the production of inflammatory
cytokines.18 In the present study, following the AT1 recep-
tor antagonism, expression of MCP-1 in the spleen was
downregulated and the population of macrophages was
preserved, evidenced by less accumulation of mac-
rophages in the myocardium. These results suggested that
local production of MCP-1 in the spleen can be consid-
ered as a potential mechanism by which macrophages are
mobilized to the heart. This mobilization of monocytes/
macrophages from the spleen to the heart is activated by
the AT1 receptor.
TGF- has been thought to be a key factor in the pro-
gression of myocardial lesions following Ang II stimula-
tion.19,20 TGF1 produced from activated macrophages
contributes to tissue fibrosis by stimulating Smads signal-
ing and releasing extracellular matrix, primarily collagens
from myocardial myofibroblasts.10,21 In the present study,
differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts was identi-
fied by the number of -SMA-expressing positive cells in
the heart. We found that, along with a reduction in migra-
tion of monocytes from the spleen and macrophage accu-
mulation in the heart by telmisartan, expression of TGF1
and Smad2//3 was inhibited to a comparable level as seen
after splenectomy. Immunohistochemical assessment of
splenectomy/telmisartan-treated rats during Ang II infu-
sion showed a significant resolution of normalizing the
fibrotic parameters such as the number of -SMA-
expressing myofibroblasts and protein levels of collagens
in the heart. Histological data presented at week 4 also
showed attenuation in tissue fibrosis as measured by a
lower extent of collagen deposition. It is known that the
spleen may have some beneficial effects on wound healing

method. In each high-powered field (HPF; original magnification: ×400; scale bars: 100 µm), the recruitment of macrophages (MAC;

and red granular pigments as indicated by arrows). Expression of eNOS (c) and the AT1 receptor (d) was identified by brown staining
in the aortic intima and media. Collagen deposition in aorta (e) was analyzed by the thickness of adventitial fibrotic area shown as
blue staining. Sham: rats were infused with a saline pump for four weeks; Ang II: rats received Ang II subcutaneous infusion at a rate

and health in general.22 However, we found that at week 4
after Ang II infusion, the scale of fibrotic tissue in the heart
was reduced to a compatible level by splenectomy as seen
in the telmisartan-treated animals, suggesting a predomi-
nant role of the splenic monocytes in the development of
cardiac fibrosis via the AT1 receptor. However, we found
that the fibrotic myocardium is still detected in the sple-
nectomy/telmisartan-treated animals. Therefore, we can-
not exclude the possibility that progenitor macrophages
released from the bone marrow or resident macrophages in
the heart may also participate in the Ang II-stimulated car-
diac fibrosis,23,24 which may not be altered by splenec-
tomy/telmisartan. Furthermore, using flow cytometry
may help to quantitatively distinguish subtypes of mono-
cytes in the spleen and demonstrate the surface marker
expression of monocytes after the AT1 receptor stimula-
tion.2 Subendothelial infiltration of monocyte/mac-
rophages has previously been reported to be associated
with endothelial dysfunction and spontaneous hyperten-
sion.25 Treatment with an ACE inhibitor lowed blood
pressure by reducing subendothelial accumulation of
monocyte/macrophages.26 A recent study has also shown
that depletion of macrophages using liposome-encapsu-
lated clodronate reduces blood pressure and vascular free
radicals.27 In the present study, we found that Ang II,
through the AT1 receptor, significantly increases blood
pressure by provoking adverse vascular remodeling.
Immunohistochemistry revealed that reduction in inva-
sion of macrophages and myofibroblasts in the aortic
endothelium and adventitia by splenectomy to a compara-
ble level as seen in the AT1 receptor antagonism suggests
a role of monocytes/macrophages mobilized from the
splenic reservoir in the formation of fibrotic thoracic aorta.
It is well known that downregulated eNOS from the
endothelium is related to impairment of endothelium-
dependent relaxation and production of vascular prolifera-
tion/hypertrophy during hypertension.28­30 We found that,
in absence of the AT1 receptor stimulation by Ang II in the
sham condition, eNOS is constitutively expressed in the
endothelium and tunica media. We and others have previ-
ously shown that activation of the AT1 receptor enhances
expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular
adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion
molecule-1 (VCAM-1), facilitates migration of inflamma-
tory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages, and
reduces eNOS expression.31­33 In these studies, downreg-
ulation of eNOS by TNF released from macrophages was
identified. Our data were consistent with these findings. In
the present study, telmisartan blocked the AT1 receptor,
inhibited macrophage migration, and upregulated eNOS.
Enhancement in eNOS expression by splenectomy further
supported that macrophages recruited in the aorta from the
spleen reservoir may participate in vascular remodeling by
downregulating eNOS expression in Ang II-receiving rats.
In this regard, vascular/myocardial fibrosis in response to
Ang II stimulation has been associated with elevated blood
pressure.10,34­36 As shown in Figure 7(e), along with a
reduction in the perivascular fibrosis and aortic hyper-
trophy by splenectomy and telmisartan, as identified by a
reduction in intimal/medial thickness, the blood pressure
was significantly reduced, indicating a role of macrophages
in induction of high blood pressure.
Limitations of this study are expressed as follows.
First, although we found that macrophage migration from
the spleen is mediated by MCP-1, also known as CCL2
(CC chemokine ligand 2), after activating the AT1 recep-
tor, the direct cause-effect relationship between MCP-1
and macrophage migration needs to be further explored
using CCL2 knockout mice in the presence of Ang II.
Second, data from our laboratory10 and others37,38 have
shown the alternative inhibitory role after the AT1 recep-
tor blockade in Ang II­mediated cardiac and vascular
effects, i.e. activation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2)-Mas receptor, we do not know whether this path-
way is also associated with an inhibition of macrophage
migration from the spleen. Therefore, studies are needed
to compare the potency of splenectomy and ACE2 analog
in modulation of macrophages in animals receiving Ang
II. Finally, we showed that splenectomy or telmisartan
reduces blood pressure. However, we cannot exclude the
possibility that reduction in blood pressure by these inter-
ventions is directly linked to an attenuation of Ang
II-driven tissue fibrosis. Therefore, using a model of
transverse aorta constriction might allow us to differenti-
ate the blood pressure-dependent and/or -independent
effects of these interventions on myocardial/vascular
fibrosis.10,16 Furthermore, it remains to be determined
whether acute infusion of Ang II after splenectomy affects
the blood count of monocytes and blood pressure.
Conclusions
Although signaling in tissue fibrosis and hypertension is a
highly complex process involving many cell types and
signaling molecules, we demonstrate novel mechanistic
insights involved in Ang II-induced perivascular/intersti-
tial fibrosis and hypertension through migrating mono-
cytes/macrophages from the spleen reservoir via the AT1
receptor. Macrophages mobilized from the spleen to the
heart trigger proliferation of myofibroblasts through
TGF1, and activate Smads-mediated collagen synthesis
and myocardial fibrosis. On the other hand, stimulation of
the AT1 receptor also causes invasion of macrophages into
the thoracic aorta and induces a fibrotic response, and
thereby promotes vascular hypertrophy/stiffness and
hypertension. However, the favorable and unfavorable
effects after splenectomy have also been identified clini-
cally.39,40 We cannot comment on the clinical application
of splenectomy in patients based on the current data, but,
our findings might be useful in exploring how therapeutics
already established, for example, ACE inhibitors or angi-
otensin receptor blockers, affect macrophage biology.

Therefore, the development of macrophage-targeted new
therapeutic interventions may further prevent cardiac
fibrosis and vascular hypertrophy during hypertension.
