Abstract
Given the large trade and current account deficits in some of the new EU member states
the development of their external economic situation plays a role in assessing their aptitude
to enter the European Monetary Union. The empirical analysis with aggregated data
indicates that in the eight central and east European EU member states FDI and trade are
complementary. This result is confirmed by an FDI enhanced gravity model which makes
use of sectoral data provided by the Bundesbank's micro database direct investment
(MIDI). The net effect of FDI on the trade balance is ambiguous, but FDI in high-tech
industries clearly stimulates exports more than imports. Technological spill-over and the
conglomeration of human capital seem to be important factors for the export performance.
Against this background the prospects for the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia and the
Slovak Republic look more favourable compared to the Baltic states.

Non technical summary
The eight countries in central and eastern Europe that acceded European Union in May
2004 all have high trade and current account deficits. The broadening of these deficits was
accompanied by a substantial increase of foreign trade. The stock of foreign direct
investment (FDI) also has been growing at double digits rates in most years since the start
of the transition process. This study analyses the link between these developments and
examines the possible effect of FDI on the trade balance in the long run.
In an initial step, estimations are made with macro data in order to identify the overall
impact of foreign direct investment. On the aggregate level, clear effects of inward FDI on
the trade balance could not be identified. Both exports and imports are stimulated by direct
investment. However, a great deal of information is lost by aggregating the data. The
Deutsche Bundesbank's micro database direct investment (MIDI) makes it possible to link
data on FDI and trade separately for countries and sectors. Thus detailed information on
the specific sectoral relationship can be made available.
Based on these data, an FDI enhanced gravity model indicates that there are important
direct and indirect effects of FDI on trade. For the manufacturing sector as a whole the
results point to a complementary relationship with both exports and imports. The net effect
on the trade balance is again unclear. Differencing according to the degree of technological
intensity shows that in the high-tech industries the link between FDI and trade is
particularly close. Exports are highly stimulated by the domestic activity of foreign firms
and the influence of FDI in other high-tech branches even exceeds the direct effect. From
this one can conclude that technological spill-over or the conglomeration of human capital
are important mechanisms which link FDI to the trade balance. With regard to imports we
rather observe a substitution of domestically produced for imported goods. FDI in sectors
with a low intensity of technology has no appreciable impact on trade.
With respect to the external economic relations with Germany those countries that attract a
significant amount of FDI in sectors with advanced technologies indeed tend to realise
surpluses or moderate deficits in the bilateral trade balance. Economies with low inward
FDI levels and a high proportion of low-tech industries, however, exhibit more pronounced
deficits. Against this background the prospects for an external economic consolidation in
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic are quite auspicious.
These countries reveal a relatively high share of FDI in the metal industry, machinery,
information and communication technologies or the car industry.
Nicht technische Zusammenfassung
Die acht Länder Mittel- und Osteuropas, die im Mai 2004 der Europäischen Union
beigetreten sind, weisen hohe Handels- und Leistungsbilanzdefizite auf. Die Ausweitung
dieser Defizite ging mit einer erheblichen Zunahme des Außenhandels einher. Auch die
Bestände an ausländischen Direktinvestitionen (ADI) wiesen in den meisten Jahren seit
Beginn des Transformationsprozesses zweistellige Wachstumsraten auf. Die vorliegende
Studie untersucht den Zusammenhang zwischen diesen Entwicklungen und analysiert
mögliche langfristige Effekte ausländischer Direktinvestitionen auf die Handelsbilanz.
In einem ersten Schritt werden Schätzungen mit Makrodaten durchgeführt, um den
Einfluss von Direktinvestitionen auf den Außenhandel insgesamt zu erfassen. Auf dieser
aggregierten Ebene lassen sich keine eindeutigen Effekte der Direktinvestitionen auf die
Handelsbilanzen in den untersuchten Ländern identifizieren. Sowohl Exporte als auch
Importe werden durch ausländische Direktinvestitionen gefördert. Ein großer Teil der
Informationen geht allerdings durch die Aggregation der Daten verloren. Die Mikro-
datenbank Direktinvestitionen (MIDI) der Deutschen Bundesbank macht es möglich,
Daten zu Direktinvestitionen und Außenhandel gesondert nach Ländern und Sektoren
zusammenzuführen und so detaillierte Informationen über den spezifischen Zusammen-
hang auf Sektorebene zu gewinnen.
Auf Basis dieser Daten deuten die Ergebnisse eines um ADI erweiterten Gravitationsan-
satzes auf wesentliche direkte und indirekte Effekte von Direktinvestitionen auf den
Außenhandel hin. Für das Verarbeitende Gewerbe insgesamt bestätigt sich eine
komplementäre Beziehung von ADI zu Exporten und Importen. Der Nettoeffekt auf die
Handelbilanz ist auch hier nicht eindeutig. Unterscheidet man nach dem Grad der
Technologieintensität, zeigt sich für den Hochtechnologiebereich, dass der Zusammenhang
zwischen Direktinvestitionen und Außenhandel besonders ausgeprägt ist. Exporte werden
durch die Beteiligung ausländischer Firmen erheblich gefördert, wobei der Einfluss von
Direktinvestitionen in anderen high-tech Branchen sogar größer ist als die direkten Effekte.
Daraus lässt sich schließen, dass technologische Übertragungseffekte oder die An-
sammlung von Humankapital wichtige Mechanismen für das Zusammenspiel von Direkt-
investitionen und Außenhandel darstellen. Auf der Importseite ist hingegen eher eine
Substitution durch lokal produzierte Güter zu beobachten. Direktinvestitionen in Branchen
mit geringer Technologieintensität haben keinen nennenswerten Einfluss auf den
Außenhandel.
Für die Wirtschaftsbeziehungen mit Deutschland zeigt sich in der Tat, dass jene Länder,
die einen hohen Bestand deutscher Direktinvestitionen in high-tech Sektoren aufweisen,
im bilateralen Warenverkehr tendenziell Überschüsse oder moderate Defizite erzielen.
Dagegen haben Länder mit einer schwach ausgeprägten Präsenz deutscher
Direktinvestoren und einem hohen Anteil von Direktinvestitionen in Sektoren mit geringer
Technologieintensität stärker ausgeprägte Defizite zu verzeichnen. Vor diesem
Hintergrund sind die Aussichten auf eine außenwirtschaftliche Konsolidierung für die
Slowakische Republik, Slowenien, die Tschechische Republik und Ungarn recht
vielversprechend. Diese Länder verzeichnen einen hohen Anteil an Direktinvestitionen in
der Metallindustrie, dem Maschinenbau, der Informations- und Kommunikations-
technologie oder in der KFZ-Industrie.

Trade balances of the central and east European EU member states
and the role of foreign direct investment*)
I Introduction
The present study is part of a research project on the current account developments of EU
member states in central and eastern Europe (EU-8) and on the associated consequences
for the enlargement of the euro area. The development of the current account is explicitly
mentioned in Article 121 (1) EC as a criterion for sustainable convergence and has to be
examined in the convergence reports of the ECB and the European Commission.
Unsustainable current account positions imply possible repercussions to the real exchange
rate or other key economic variables and are therefore of special interest. In an earlier
study we have identified the macroeconomic determinants of current account deficits. A
major result was that the current account deficits are being influenced mainly by factors
that are connected with the stage of economic development, primarily buoyant
investment.1 Even if this result is basically positive for the future current account
developments, essential risks remain and consist in possible set backs of the catching-up
process and in the long-run effects of direct investment inflows.
This paper therefore focuses on the role which foreign direct investment plays for the
external position of the eight new EU member states. Since the start of the transition
process the central and east European EU countries have been attracting ever increasing
amounts of FDI. In most years the annual growth rates have been in double digits. At the
same time, trade with the EU has been intensified immensely. The purpose of this study is
to ascertain whether there is a link between these developments and to examine the
prospects of future trade balance developments that can be expected as a consequence of
foreign direct investment in the long run.
The interplay between FDI and trade greatly depends on the motives behind the investment
of multinational enterprises (MNEs). Corporate behaviour results in trade and investment

flows that can be examined by means of gravity models.2 The main purpose of the analysis
is to verify to what extent foreign direct investment is complementary or substitutive to
exports and imports and whether it affects the trade balance positively or negatively. A
negative relationship between inward foreign direct investment and the trade balance is
mainly to be expected if the subsidiaries primarily serve as marketing companies. By
contrast, positive effects are likely to predominate if foreign direct investment increases
the output of export goods and import substitutes. Outward direct investment by domestic
enterprises may also have positive or negative effects on the trade balance.
In an initial step, panel estimations for the eight countries are made at the aggregate level
in order to identify the total impact of foreign direct investment. However, a great deal of
information is lost by aggregating the data. The Deutsche Bundesbank's micro database
direct investment (MIDI) makes it possible to link bilateral data on FDI and trade
separately for countries and sectors.3 Sectors are an appropriate level of aggregation, since
they form relatively homogenous groups of firms without being too sensitive to outliers.
Furthermore, not only direct but also indirect effects can be taken into account. These arise
when direct investment affects the competitiveness or growth of other sectors through
externalities, technological spill-over effects or changes in the relative factor endowment.
Section II sets out the current account situations as well as developments in foreign direct
investment and trade flows in the eight central and east European economies. Section III
provides an overview of the relevant literature. In section IV empirical analyses are
undertaken both at the macroeconomic level and by means of sectoral data. Section V
shows implications for the trade balances of the central and east European member states.
Section VI summarises and draws conclusions concerning EMU enlargement.
II The current account situations as well as developments of FDI and
trade in the EU member states of central and eastern Europe
This section provides a brief overview of the current account and trade balance situations
in the eight central and east European EU member states and shortly describes the
developments in direct investment and foreign trade. Figure 1 shows that the current
account deficits in four EU member countries of Central and Eastern Europe exceeded 8%

have their roots back in the 1960s and are based on Tinbergen (1962) and Linnemann (1966) among others.

of GDP in 2004. In Estonia and Latvia they even amounted to around 12% of GDP. In
most countries deficits in the trade balances were higher than in the current account, since
current transfers, especially EU payments, more than compensated for the negative income
balance. Only in the Czech Republic and Hungary net income payments exceeded current
transfers and attributed substantially to the current account deficit.

In the following we focus on trade effects of FDI, since this link clearly dominates the
relationship between FDI and the current account.4 Figure 2 shows the flows of imports
and exports as well as the stock of inward FDI (FDI_IN) and outward FDI (FDI_OUT) for
the central and east European economies between 1994 and 2003.
When seen in the aggregate, trade flows are much more important than the stock of foreign
direct investment. This is particularly true at the beginning of the period under review
when exports and imports accounted for about four times the aggregated direct investment
stocks. Owing to the ­ at times ­ fairly differing developments, however, the ratios change
over the years. While the annual growth rates of foreign direct investment are mostly in

Consequently, in 2003 direct investment stocks were already accounting for about 60% of
exports and imports. High rates of growth can also be seen in the case of direct investment
by the central and east European EU member states abroad even if the level is low. At the
current end it still accounts for less than 5% of exports and imports.

III Review of the literature
Over a lengthy period of time the theory of direct investment developed independently of
international trade theory and ignored the influence of multinationals on the structures of
foreign trade and the trade balance. However, these approaches could hardly explain
empirical findings such as the growing importance of horizontal direct investment between
5 The decrease in 2003 was solely due to changes in the valuation and resulted from depreciations of the
national currencies vis-à-vis the euro. At constant prices and exchange rates this year showed an increase,
too. The sharp rise in foreign direct investment is in part due to liberalisation measures which have probably
eased the inflows of capital ­ as well as the outflows ­ during the period under review. Another reason is the
important role played by privatisation and the associated M&A activities, especially in the initial phase of the
transformation process. Greenfield investment became more important later.

economies with comparable levels of income in times of dwindling trade barriers. The
reorientation of trade theory at the beginning of the 1980s ­ to encompass product
diversification, increasing returns to scale and imperfect markets ­ made it finally possible
to combine trade theory and theory of multinationals.
Drawing on empirical findings, Markusen (1984) developed stylised facts about
multinationals and linked these consistently - under the heading "Knowledge Capital
Model" - to the specific characteristics of firms and countries.6 He comes to the conclusion
that multinationals foster the international division of labour and that foreign direct
investment ­ unlike portfolio investment ­ has to be seen as a complement to trade in
goods.7 While Markusen concentrated on horizontal direct investment, Helpman (1984)
and Grossman/Helpman (1991) investigated the impact of vertical direct investment, which
involves the fragmentation of the production process in dependence of varying factor
endowments. Differing factor costs determine the choice of the most favourable place to
locate production. As in the models developed by Markusen, a complementary relationship
can also be expected here.
The simultaneous inclusion of vertical and horizontal direct investment is analytically
complex and occurs for the first time in the studies undertaken by Markusen (2002) and
Markusen et al (1996). One of the results of these types of model is that, depending on
country-specific characteristics, direct investment and trade can be mutually replaceable or
complementary. For example, FDI lowers the volume of trade if trade barriers and the
similarity of standards are substantial. By contrast, an increase in trade volumes can be
expected, if the obstacles to trade are low and the country characteristics are rather
different.
The question whether FDI is substitutive or complementary to trade can eventually only be
answered by empirical studies. However, the empirical literature on direct investment and
6 1. Fragmentation/transportation: multinational enterprises make intensively use of human capital.
Knowledge-based services can be provided at various locations at little cost. Human capital can therefore be
concentrated in areas away from the actual place of production. 2. Skilled labour intensity: in contrast to the
production of finished products, the values arising from human capital depend on the availability of well
qualified manpower. 3. Jointness: values created on the basis of specialised know-how serve as inputs in
multiple production processes and represent a kind of public good in the firm. In connection with this there
are "multi-plant economies of scale", ie the input factor is used at various locations without its marginal
productivity being reduced as a result. By contrast, increasing returns to scale at the enterprise level would
argue in favour of concentration and for a decision in favour of exports. See, in particular, Markusen (1995).
7 This contradicts the results of the Heckscher-Ohlin model, which assumes substitutive relationship
between trade in goods and trade in factors of production. Markusen (1984) makes it clear, however, that his
result is due to the specific assumptions made in the model. He supposes that the trade in factors of
production is a prerequisite for achieving gains from trade and increasing the volumes of traded goods.
­ 5 ­
foreign trade is just as complex as the theoretical models. For the new EU member states in
central and eastern Europe Hoekman/Djankov (1997) come to the conclusion that - with
the exception of Poland - no significant correlation exists between direct investment and
the structure of the export markets. By contrast, Zemplinerova (1997) finds out that in the
Czech Republic firms with foreign participation are more export oriented than domestic
firms. As Brenton/Di Mauro/Lücke (1999) illustrate for various country groups in central
and eastern Europe, however, more is also imported at the same time. According to
Holland/Pomerantz (2003) the impact of direct investment on the trade balance of the new
EU members (with the exception of Cyprus and Malta) is more or less neutral because
imports and exports increase at the same rate. Lankes/Venables (1997) argue on the basis
of surveys that the main goal of foreign direct investment in central and eastern Europe is
to serve the domestic markets more adequately.
Focusing on direct investment of German firms Marin/Lorentowicz/Raubold (2003)
analyse 1500 FDI projects in Eastern Europe and find a high share of intra firm exports to
the parent company in those sectors in which Eastern Europe is commonly seen to have a
comparative advantage and where the relocation of production makes particular sense.8 A
recent survey of Becker/Jäckle/Mündler (2005) based on FDI and employment data
supports the assumption that German FDI in Central and Eastern Europe is predominantly
of a vertical nature. This is also confirmed by a survey undertaken by the German
Chamber of Industry and Commerce [DIHK] (2005) according to which German direct
investment as a whole is primarily influenced by sales motives whereas in the central and
east European EU member states efficiency seeking is the most often cited motive for FDI.
The paper at hand is different from the cited studies in that regressions on the aggregate
level that are designed to capture the overall impact of FDI on trade are complemented by
sectoral estimates that are able to identify direct and indirect effects in the bilateral
relationships between the home and the host country. One might expect that in sectors,
where competitiveness is mainly determined by production costs, FDI usually entails the
relocation of specific production stages and primarily affects trade within the same sector.
In those branches, on the other hand, where the quality and the variety of products play an
essential role, the motives for FDI may be more complex and intra-sectoral spill-over
effects can also be important. Consequently - and in analogy to country-specific effects
cited by Markusen et al (1996) - sector-specific effects can also entail complementary or
substitutive relationships between FDI and trade which are diluted by aggregating the data
n the macro level. The analysis of these linkages is possible by matching the micro

database of the German federal statistical office. In contrast to studies based on surveys we
can do this for the entirety of officially registered activities. Furthermore, we concentrate
on the relatively homogenous panel of the eight new EU member states in Central and
Eastern Europe. Doing so we enlarge our database in opposite to individual country studies
without mixing countries with very different economic backgrounds. Admittedly however,
the trade-off between the number and the homogeneity of data cannot be totally solved.
IV FDI and trade of the central and east European EU member states
4.1. Estimations at the aggregate level
The empirical study on the impact of FDI on trade is based on a panel of the eight central
and east European EU member states. The period under review is from 1994 to 2004. In
order to eliminate valuation effects and to reduce the problem of simultaneity the estimates
are done with constant values.9 In an initial step, the analyses are carried out at the
macroeconomic level. The regression equation to be estimated for the exports and for the
imports is:

where EXP and IMP are the central and east European economies' real exports and imports
respectively. GDP is the real gross domestic product of the transition country and
represents the size of the national economy. The gross value added in the OECD countries
(GDPOECD
) serves as a proxy for the size of the external markets. The other variables are
RER as the real effective exchange rate10, FDI_IN as the stock of inward FDI and
FDI_OUT as the stock of outward FDI.11 All variables are logarithms. For 1
, 2
, 1

9 FDI denominated in US-dollar is deflated with the US GDP deflator. For exports and imports national unit
values of exports and imports or ­ if these are not available - the national GDP deflators are used. FDI data
stem from UN, World Investment Report. Other data are from the Eurostat NewCronos database and the
IMF International Financial Statistics database. See the annex for further information. The estimations were
carried out using Eviews 5.1.
10 The indirect quotation of the exchange rate is used, ie a rise in the variable means an appreciation.
11 We use lagged FDI values that indicate the capital stock at the end of the previous year. This makes it
possible to isolate long-term production effects of FDI on the trade balance from one-time transactions that
occur in the context of the investment activity. From an economic point of view it might also be reasonable
to increase the lag even further in order to account for the time span that lies between the initial investment

and 3
a plus sign is expected and for 3
a minus sign. The signs for 4
, 5
, 4
and 5
are
uncertain a priori and have to be established empirically.
Unit root tests indicate that the individual time series are non stationary.12 We therefore
run a two-steps Engle-Granger procedure.13 Furthermore, existing empirical and
theoretical studies suggest that the explanatory variables are not strictly exogenous.14 To
take account of a possible endogeneity, a dynamic OLS (DOLS) procedure was chosen. A
fixed effect estimator with fixed country as well as time effects was used both for the
export and import equation. The heteroscedasticity error structure was corrected by a
robust White estimator.15
In Table 1 the results for the export and import equations are shown. The GDP has a plus
sign and is significant at the 1% level in both estimations. World output is captured by the
time fixed effects.16 Somewhat surprisingly, a real effective appreciation not only entails
higher imports, but is also positively correlated with exports. This might be due to the fact,
that the real exchange rate tends to appreciate during the catching-up process without
affecting price competitiveness.17
and the start of production. This argument, however, mainly holds for greenfield investment, but not
necessarily for mergers and acquisitions. The econometric results also give support to a one-year lag.
12 The panel unit root tests of Levin/Lin/Chu (2002), Breitung (2000), Im/Pesaran/Shin (2003) and
Maddala/Wu (1999) were used, but do not obtain uniform results owing to the short observation period.
13 See Engle/Granger (1987). The stationarity of the residuals of a fixed effects OLS regression was tested
using the panel cointegration tests of Pedroni (1995) and Kao (1997). According to the test of Pedroni both
the export and the import equation are clearly cointegrated. The test of Kao verifies cointegration only for
the export equation, but is not able to reject the null of no cointegration for the import equation. In a second
step, an error correction estimation was carried out. The error correction term is significantly negative. To
that extent, the time series move towards the long-term equilibrium. See Kremers et al (1992).
14 For trade effects on direct investment see, for example, the empirical studies by Kreinin et al (2000) and
Petri/Plummer (1996). In the present paper such relationships are eliminated through the use of lagged direct
investment stocks. But the endogeneity problem cannot entirely be ruled out for GDP and the real exchange
rate. For example, Frankel/Rose (2000) assume that foreign trade will have a significant effect on income.
Endogeneity is also treated in detail by Maxwell et al (1995). He found no uniform results from his sample
of 46 developing countries. However, he does identify variables which influence the direction of the existing
causality. He shows, for example, that a large amount of debt reduces the likelihood that the financial
account affects the current account. Conversely, a high growth rate and a high ratio of private-sector credit to
GDP increases the likelihood that the current account determines the financial account. The more developed
the foreign exchange markets, the more likely it is that direct investment is exogenous.
15 See Saikkonen (1991) and Stock/Watson (1993). A lead and a lag of the difference as well as the
differences themselves were used as explanatory variables for GDP and RER. In view of the restricted
number of observations, the insignificant fixed effects were excluded from the estimation.
16 World output only changes in time, but not for the individual countries. Including it explicitly in the
estimation together with fixed time effects would yield singular matrices.
17 This phenomenon is closely linked to the so called Balassa-Samuelson effect. For a discussion of real
appreciation in the new EU member states see for example Fischer (2002).

The positive parameter of the direct investment stocks in the export equation indicates that
increased amounts of intermediate and finished products are returned from the subsidiary
to the parent company or the subsidiaries serve as an export platform for other markets.18
Indirect effects of inward investment on other sectors can also play a role. Such spill-over
effects can arise, for example, in the course of technology transfers and improve the
competitiveness of the economy as a whole.19
The stocks of inward FDI also stimulate imports. This could be a sign that fairly large
volumes of the parent company's intermediate products flow into the subsidiary's output
or that the foreign firms draw on established business relationships with foreign partner
firms for intermediate products. Another explanation could be that the aim of the direct
investment of the parent company is to acquire better access to the markets of the host
country.
18 For the significance of direct investment as an export platform see also Ekholm et al (2003). According to
Hanson et al (2001), the importance of an economy as an export platform is promoted when trade restrictions
are low and the domestic market is rather small.
19 Markusen (1997) sees the main advantage of direct investment in the fact that a country is provided with
the necessary inputs to produce more efficiently. According to Ethier/Markusen (1996), direct investment
makes the transfer of know-how easier. This is essential for dynamic comparative advantages and for the
long-term improvement of competitiveness. Borenstein et al (1998) are among those who point out the
empirical relationships between direct investment and growth. They show that direct investment increases
the marginal productivity of capital, fosters technical progress and thereby stimulates the growth of an
economy. Balasubramanyam et al (1999) also speak of direct investment as an engine of economic growth.
However, Aitken/Harrison (1999) come to the conclusion that with respect to Venezuela the aggregate effect
of foreign direct investment for the economy as a whole will probably tend to be low because, although the
productivity of the foreign enterprises increases, that of domestic firms is impaired. The 6th Structural Issue
Report of the ECB (2005) highlights the stimulating effects of high-tech FDI for the catching-up process of
Ireland.

The direct investment stocks of the central and east European EU member states abroad
have a positive effect on exports, although their importance is much less pronounced than
in the case of inward FDI. Imports, on the other hand, are not significantly influenced.
According to the estimations carried out, no clear effects of inward FDI on the trade
balance can be identified. Both exports and imports are stimulated by direct investment.
This is in accordance with the results of Holland/Pomerantz (2003) for Poland, Hungary,
the Czech Republic and Slovenia, who cannot find a net effect of FDI on the trade balance,
either.
Fontagné/Paijot (2000) point out that the results at the aggregate level may represent a
purely statistical phenomenon. Altzinger (1998) also deals with the loss of information
arising from macroeconomic estimations. To that extent, it seems appropriate to add
estimations at the sectoral level where differing linkages between FDI and trade can be
captured. This is especially important for the evaluation of future structural adjustments
between sectors during the catching-up process. On the other hand, sectoral data are less
sensitive to outliers than firm level data. Furthermore, direct and indirect effects can be
taken into account separately at the sectoral level. Besides, Lipsey/Weiss (1984) assume
that sectoral estimations reduce the simultaneity problem.20
4.2. Estimations at the sectoral level
Estimates on the sectoral level are only possible for the bilateral economic relationships
between the eight countries under consideration and Germany. Sectoral data of overall FDI
are either incomplete or not detailed enough to conduct an econometric study. Since
German firms have played a pioneering role in establishing affiliates in central and eastern
Europe, the economic relations of the eight EU member states with Germany might
nevertheless give an idea of future external economic patterns with other partners, too.
In this section we focus on trade in manufactured goods for two reasons: First, the
manufacturing sector is the most important playing field for German firms in central and
eastern Europe. Second, trade in commodities and services both feature some
particularities which make it difficult to compare them with each other and with
20 In addition to the endogeneity problem, there is also a simultaneity problem, ie a kind of spurious
regression which arises from the fact that the two variables are influenced by other variables such as the state
of development of the host country. See Tadesse/Ryan (2004), Frankel et al (1995) and Poon/Thompson
(1998). By contrast, Min (2003) cannot identify a simultaneity problem.

manufactured goods.21 Trade in commodities is usually determined by the availability of
natural resources. International transactions in services, on the other hand, often are
difficult to be interpreted in terms of exports or imports.22 In the following we differentiate
between eight manufacturing industries.23
Figure 3 shows foreign trade with Germany and inward FDI from Germany for the eight
central and east European member states in the eight industries.24 By far the highest
investment level can be identified in the production of vehicles and transport equipment as
well as in the chemical industry including the manufacturing of rubber synthetics and
mineral products. In these sectors German firms were engaged with about 5 billion and 4
billion euro, respectively, in 2003. A considerable amount of FDI can also be observed in
the information and communication technology (ICT) sector amounting to just under 2
billion euro. In all the other sectors German FDI barely exceeded 1 billion euro during the
observation period. The development of FDI is quite steady in all the sectors which is in
line with the observation of total FDI on the macroeconomic level (Figure 1).
Looking at trade flows, production of vehicles and transport equipment together with ICT
goods is again the most important sector, closely followed by machinery. Interestingly, in
all these sectors the initial trade balance deficits vis-à-vis Germany have diminished over
time. In ICT and the car industry the eight central and east European countries have even
become net exporters. The growth of exports usually took off in the second half of the
observation period, whereas the dynamic of imports does not show uniform patterns in the
individual sectors. In the chemical industry, the trade deficit has continuously widened as a
result of muted export growth and a steady increase of imports. In other sectors, namely
textiles and clothing or manufactured wood and paper, the countries under consideration
have realised trade surpluses vis-à-vis Germany during the whole observation period.
21 A specific study on the relationship between FDI and cross-border financial services on the base of the
Bundesbank's micro database direct investment (MIDI) has been conducted by Buch/Lipponer (2004).
22 Reported income of insurances, eg, is equivalent to the balance of insurance contributions received and
payments for insured losses. Consequently, the values in the statistics are much lower than the underlying
transactions and can even be negative. Furthermore, their volatility is widely determined by exogenous
incidents and not by economic fundamentals.
23 The match between the SITC systematic for foreign trade and the NACE, Rev. 1.1 classification of the
European Union, which is relevant for FDI data, is described in the annex. Trade data are from the German
Federal Statistical Office, FDI data from the micro database of the Deutsche Bundesbank. Other data used in
the estimations stem from Eurostat. For further details see the annex.
24 Outward FDI of the new member states in Germany is not included, since it is negligible.

Whereas all the time series in Figure 3 exhibit a positive trend it is not obvious whether
there exists a direct link between FDI stocks and trade flows. In order to investigate the
relationship in more detail we run panel regressions for the time from 1994 to 2004 with
the eight manufacturing sectors listed above and the eight central and east European EU
member countries. We employ an FDI enhanced gravity model with industrial production
at constant prices (IND) of the individual countries and Germany.25 Relative unit labour
costs in the manufacturing sector (ULC) are used as a measure of price competitiveness.26

where MF indicates the manufacturing sector, PS the primary sector and SV stands for
services. Whereas 4
and 4
capture the direct effects of inward FDI (FDI_IN) on trade
within the manufacturing sector, 5
, 6
, 5
and 6
indicate the role of spill-over from FDI in
other sectors.27 Unit root tests suggest again a non stationarity of the data. Likewise the
estimations on the macro level we therefore run the two-step Engle-Granger procedure and
use the DOLS fixed effect estimator.28
In a first step we analyse separately the effects on trade in manufactured goods stemming
from FDI in the manufacturing sector (FDI_MF), in the primary sector (FDI_PS) and in
services (FDI_SV). Whereas a close relationship within the manufacturing sector might
indicate a fragmentation of production, spill-over effects from the primary sector can result
from complementary trade of equipment. Finally, the impact of FDI in services possibly
reflects more general consequences of a deeper economic integration.
25 The distance to Germany is captured by the fixed effects. Explicitly incorporating it into the regressions
yields singular matrices.
26 Relative unit labour costs are defined as the ratio of nominal unit labour costs in country i to the
respective value in Germany. Since national unit labour costs are calculated in national currency, they are
deflated with the nominal exchange rate against the euro (DM until 1998).
27 Outward FDI of the new member states in Germany is again ignored. The other variables are the same as
in equations (1) and (2).
28 Unit root tests for the individual variables are again of lower reliability because of the short time span.
For the DOLS estimates we use cross section weights in order to take account of heteroscedasticity and draw
on panel corrected standard errors to consider contemporaneous correlation. AR-terms correct for serial
correlation.

Table 2 presents the results for the sectoral export (EXP_MF) and import (IMP_MF)
equations.29 They are consistent with the outcomes on the aggregate level (Table 1).
Generally, there is a positive link between trade and industrial production at home or
abroad, but only the impact of industrial production in a given acceded country on its
imports is significant. Higher relative unit labour costs negatively affect exports and lead
to higher imports. FDI in manufacturing stimulates both exports and imports of
manufactured goods. Cross-sectoral impacts from FDI in the primary sector are also
significant. Direct investment in services, however, is found to influence only imports, but
not exports. This result might point to the role of marketing companies or the influence of
German banks which make accessible foreign funds and hence facilitate imports. In their
descriptive survey of German FDI and employment in foreign affiliates
Becker/Jäckle/Mündler (2005) also find evidence of growing importance of market
oriented FDI in central and eastern Europe.
29 The residuals of fixed effects OLS estimations are stationary according to the tests of Pedroni (1995) and
Kao (1997). The error correction term in the error correction model is significant and also points to the
existence of a co-integration relationship.
­ 14 ­
All in all, the net effects of FDI on the trade balance are still unclear. FDI in the primary
and the manufacturing sectors seems to stimulate trade as a whole. FDI in the services
sector tends to passivate the trade balance.
In a next step we now want to analyse in more detail the link between trade and FDI within
the manufacturing sector which is the most important playing field of German FDI in
Central and Eastern Europe. We therefore differentiate between direct effects that occur
within the same industry and cross-sectoral repercussions that reflect interdependencies
between the individual branches. Since industrial production and unit labour costs are not
available on the sectoral level for the whole sample we furthermore use aggregated data for
manufacturing (without construction) and concentrate the sectoral analysis on the impact
of FDI on trade:

Table 3 shows that FDI has sensible positive effects on exports in the same industry
(FDI_SEC). This outcome might again reflect a fragmentation of production which is
­ 15 ­
motivated by cost reduction. However, positive spill-over from FDI in other manufacturing
sectors (FDI_MF) seems to be even more important.30 The impact of FDI on imports is
also positive within and across industries. These cross-section effects point to the existence
of substantial economic links between individual industries.
In a last step we therefore try to get some additional insight into the nature of spill-over
within the manufacturing sector. In the literature technology transfers of foreign affiliates
to domestic firms are often cited to be a driving force in the catching-up process of
reforming countries. If this phenomenon also plays a role in the new EU member states it
should be possible to identify differences between individual industries in dependence of
their technology intensity. In order to get an acceptable compromise between the number
of observations and the homogeneity of the cross-sections we define a high-tech and a low-
tech sector, each comprising four industries.

Albeit the classification of the chemical industry is not straightforward, in this study we
add it to the low-tech sector which also includes the production of food, beverages and
tobacco, the textile and leather industry and the manufacturing of paper or wood. On the
30 These findings are in line with the results of Blattner (2004) for South-East Asia, but are in contrast to the
studies of Damijan et al (2001), Görg/Greenaway (2001) or Konings (1999).
­ 16 ­
other hand, the metal industry, machinery, the information and communication technology
and the production of vehicles and transport equipment are defined as high-tech
manufacturing.
In Table 4 the macro variables only have a significant effect on high-tech imports, but no
impact on exports can be verified. This is probably due to the limited correlation between
the aggregates and the underlying variables which represent the developments in the
various branches. With regard to FDI, where idiosyncratic data for the individual industries
are used, significant trade effects can be detected from FDI in the same industry
(FDI_SEC) and from FDI in other high-tech industries (FDI_HIGH).31 FDI in the high-
tech sector as a whole (FDI_SEC+FDI_HIGH) clearly has a positive impact on the trade
balance in high-tech goods. This net effect is primarily due to a positive spill-over on
exports and negative cross-effects for imports. With regard to exports technology transfers
might play a role. A similar mechanism is the conglomeration of human capital induced by
pioneering firms. Conglomeration effects might also be responsible for import substitution
in the high-tech sector, when intermediate goods which were previously imported are now
produced in the same country. FDI in the low-tech sector also stimulates exports, but has
no significant effect on imports.
The close link between FDI and trade that could be established for the manufacturing
sector as a whole and the high-tech industries in particular, cannot be affirmed for the low-
tech sector (see Table 5). Only a positive direct effect of FDI on imports in the same
industry and a negative indirect impact of FDI in the high-tech sector on imports in the
low-tech sector is confirmed.
31 Due to the reduced number of observations we use dummies for countries and for sectors instead of fixed
effects for each cross section. As before we use cross sections weights and cross-section SUR panel
corrected standard errors to take into account heteroscedasticity as well as contemporaneous correlation. AR-
terms correct for serial correlation.

Summarising, the sectoral analysis indicates that there are important direct and indirect
effects of FDI on trade. For the manufacturing sector the results point to a complementary
relationship with both exports and imports. The net effect on the trade balance is unclear.
The same is true for FDI in the primary sector which stimulates trade as a whole. FDI in
services, on the other hand, only has a significant impact on imports, whereas no effect on
exports can be detected. The negative impact on the trade balance might be due to the
presence of distributing companies. Differencing according to the degree of technological
intensity shows that in the high-tech industries the link between FDI and trade is very
close. Exports are highly stimulated by the domestic activity of foreign firms and the
influence of FDI in other high-tech branches exceeds the direct effect. From this one can
conclude that technological spill-over or the conglomeration of human capital are
important mechanisms which link FDI to the trade balance. With regard to imports we
rather observe a substitution of domestically produced for imported goods in the high-tech
sector. FDI in sectors with a low intensity of technology has no appreciable impact on
trade.

V Implications for the trade balances of the central and east European
EU member states
The empirical analysis has shown that FDI can play an important role for the sustainability
and a future reversal of current trade balance deficits in the central and east European EU
member states. This is especially true for countries, who attract FDI in technologically
advanced sectors such as the metal industry, machinery, information and communication
technologies or the automobile industry. Figures 4 and 5 show the link between inward
manufacturing FDI, high-tech FDI and the trade balance for the eight central and east
European countries vis-à-vis Germany and the world.

For the external relations with Germany Figure 4 backs the econometric results that those
countries that attract a significant amount of FDI in sectors with advanced technologies
tend to realise surpluses or only moderate deficits in the bilateral trade balance. Economies
with low inward FDI levels and a high proportion of low-tech industries, on the other
hand, exhibit the highest deficits. Turning to Figure 5 it becomes evident that the overall
share of high-tech industries in manufacturing FDI is below the respective values of FDI
coming from Germany. This might explain, to some extent, why all the eight countries
under consideration run overall trade balance deficits.
­ 19 ­
Given the level and structure of FDI and based on the experience in the bilateral external
relationships of the individual countries with Germany one could argue the current trade
deficits of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic are
less worrisome and will diminish over time, whereas the situation in the Baltic States is
much less favourable.

VI Conclusion
Given the large trade and current account deficits in some of the new EU member states
the sustainability and the likely development of their external economic situation becomes
an important criterion to assess their aptitude to enter the European Monetary Union. To a
certain extent trade and current account deficits are normal or even desirable for reforming
countries, since the catching-up process can be significantly enhanced by the inflow of
foreign capital and technologies. In this context FDI plays a crucial role.
Economic literature describes a multitude of links between FDI and trade making it
difficult to predict the likely development of trade patterns with respect to FDI inflows.
The empirical analysis with aggregated and sectoral data indicates that in the eight central
and east European EU member states FDI and trade are positively correlated. So far, our
­ 20 ­
outcomes are in line with previous findings in the literature, even if results for overall FDI
are less clear than studies that focus on German FDI.
Additionally, the sectoral analysis has shown that indirect effects are at least as important
as direct effects. Especially in the high-tech sector technological spill-over and the
conglomeration of human capital seem to be important factors for the export performance.
The important differences that are revealed between sectors and industries are of high
relevance for the assessment of the sustainability of existing trade deficits and for
economic policy.
Against this background the data suggest that the prospects for the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic look quite auspicious. These countries reveal a
relatively high share of FDI in the metal industry, machinery, information and
communication technologies or the car industry. Hungary and the Slovak Republic already
now display surpluses in their trade with Germany. Since the economic integration of the
central and east European EU countries with other EU member states often lag somewhat
behind their relationship with Germany one might expect a general relaxation of their
foreign trade positions. The Baltic States, however, where the engagement of foreign
investors in these branches is rather low, cannot expect a significant improvement of their
foreign trade positions from this side.
Another aspect, which was not explicitly addressed in this paper, are possible third country
effects of FDI which arise when a country becomes an export platform of foreign firms.
This "Irish" strategy would further strengthen the important role of FDI in the catching-up
process and potentially help to overcome problems of excessive trade deficits. An
empirical analysis of this phenomenon for central and eastern Europe requires a more
detailed and complete database than is available at time and remains a topic of future
research.
