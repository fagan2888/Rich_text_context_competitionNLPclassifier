Long-Term Obesity Risk

Objective: Contemporary childbearing is associated with greater gestational weight gain and postpartum
weight retention than in previous decades, potentially leading to a more pronounced effect of childbear-
ing on women's long-term obesity risk. Previous work on the association of childbearing with women's
long-term obesity risk mostly examined births in the 1970s and 1980s and produced mixed results.
The association of childbearing and obesity incidence in a diverse, contemporary sample of 2731 US
women was estimated.
Methods: Propensity-score (PS) matching was used for confounding control when estimating the effect
of incident parity (1996-2001) on 7-year incident obesity (BMI30 kg/m2) (2001-2008).
Results: In the sample, 19.3% of parous women became obese, whereas 16.1% of unmatched nulliparous
women did. After PS matching without and with replacement, the differences in obesity incidence were, respec-
tively, 0.0 percentage points (ppts) (95% CI: 24.7 to 4.7) and 0.9 ppts (95% CI: 24.9 to 6.7). Results were similar
in analyses of prevalent parity and obesity in 2008 (n 5 6601) conducted to explore possible selection bias.
Conclusions: These results imply that, in contemporary US parous women in their late 20s and early
30s, childbearing may not increase obesity incidence.

Introduction
Between the late 1970s and 2010, age-adjusted prevalence of obesity
in U.S. women more than doubled, increasing from 15% to 36%
(1,2). It is believed that childbearing may contribute to increased obe-
sity prevalence in U.S. women (3). If so, the unique risk posed by
childbearing may constrain the effectiveness of population-based strat-
egies to reduce obesity prevalence in women of childbearing age.
Despite the widespread belief that childbearing increases women's
obesity risk, the evidence is mixed. There are few long-term, popu-
lation-based studies in diverse samples that attempt to estimate the
association between childbearing and weight gain or obesity. Many
studies investigate related issues, such as the effect of gestational
weight gain on weight retention among parous women (4,5). How-
ever, these types of studies do not control for aging and secular
trends, nor account for what a woman's weight gain would have
been had she not had a child (3). Of the studies that have investi-
gated the association between childbearing on long-term weight gain
or obesity risk, some find an association (6-9), whereas others find
inconsequential (10,11) or inverse associations (12).
Previous studies may have been limited by inadequate confounding
control. Uncontrolled confounding is a source of substantial bias in
this literature: both the timing of childbearing and excess weight
gain are strongly associated with demographic and socioeconomic
factors, such as family education, immigration status, race, ethnicity,

and residential characteristics (7). In any given study, adjustment for
available covariates may have been inadequate to produce condi-
tional exchangeability between parous and nulliparous women. Fur-
ther, the effect of childbearing on women's obesity risk may be
dynamic. Previous studies examined births in the 1970s, 1980s, and
1990s among mostly White or Black women. However, the literature
on gestational weight gain provides circumstantial evidence that the
association between childbearing and obesity varies by ethnicity and
may have changed in more recent maternal cohorts (13). For instance,
levels of gestational weight gain and post-partum weight retention,
risk factors for higher BMI and obesity, appear to be increasing over
time and are greater in U.S. Blacks versus Whites (4). In a more obe-
sogenic and ethnically diverse population of women, the association
between childbearing and obesity may be stronger than seen in previ-
ous studies. Alternatively, with higher obesity rates among contempo-
rary young women, childbearing may be a less salient risk factor for
incident obesity than in previous maternal cohorts.
Using data from an ethnically diverse, contemporary population of
women, this analysis seeks to estimate the effect of childbearing
among contemporary women who first gave birth in their late teens
and early 20s.
Methods
Population
Data were from female respondents to the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The baseline wave of Add
Health (1994-1995) was a nationally representative survey of U.S.
public and private school students enrolled in grades 7 through 12
(14). The original Add Health survey focused on adolescent risk
behaviors and collected a wealth of behavioral data. The survey was
cluster-sampled by school and also over-sampled subgroups including
Chinese students, black students with a parent who had completed
college or attained a professional degree, and disabled students.
At baseline, detailed questionnaires were administered to each stu-
dent and to the student's primary in-residence caregiver, preferen-
tially female. Over the next 13 years, three more waves of data
were collected. For instance, in 1995-1996 (wave 2), a year after the
baseline survey, all students except those in 12th grade at baseline
were re-interviewed. In 2001-2002 (wave 3), 7 years after baseline,
all baseline study respondents were re-interviewed. Finally, in 2008
(wave 4), baseline study respondents were interviewed again.
Exposure: incidence model
The main exposure was incident parity between waves 2 and 3. We
examined parity as a dichotomous variable (yes/no) because previ-
ous studies suggest that the first birth is uniquely important for obe-
sity risk (3,6,8). We defined parity as having delivered a live birth
or completed a full-term pregnancy, including a full-term pregnancy
that may have ended in stillbirth. Data on pregnancy histories were
collected at wave 3 from questionnaires administered via computer-
assisted devices. The respondent detailed all her pregnancies, includ-
ing how and when they ended. Pregnancy data were not collected at
wave 2 (1995-1996). Therefore, to exclude girls who were already
parous at wave 2, we excluded women who reported that they had
given birth or had full-term pregnancies that ended in 1996 or
before.
Outcome: incidence model
The main outcome was incident obesity between wave 3 and wave
4. At both waves, obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) 
30.0 kg/m2 (15), based on measured height and weight. We
restricted the analysis to women who were nonobese (BMI < 30.0
kg/m2) at wave 3.
Exclusions: incidence model
The analysis sample was restricted to women who were nulliparous
in the wave 2 interview year and nonobese at wave 2 and wave 3.
There were 7294 female respondents at wave 4. Of those, 4770
were also present at wave 1, wave 2, and wave 3 (65.4%). We
excluded 332 women who were pregnant at wave 4 (n 5 330,
7.4%) or who reported having given birth within the past 6 months
of the wave 4 interview (n 5 5, <1%), including three women fit-
ting both criteria, because temporary pregnancy-related weight gain
could lead to misclassification of the obesity outcome. An additional
198 women were excluded because they were pregnant at wave 3.
Of the remaining 4253 women, 148 (3.4%) were missing obesity
status at wave 2, wave 3, or wave 4: at wave 2, 33 respondents
(<1%) were missing obesity status, at wave 3, 61 (1.4%) were miss-
ing obesity status, and at wave 4, 62 (1.4%) were missing obesity
status. Of the remaining 4105 women, 1199 (29.2%) were excluded
because they were obese at wave 2 (n 5 533, 13%), parous at wave
2 (n 5 203, 4.9%), or became obese between wave 2 and wave 3 (n
5 533, 13%). The final analysis sample consisted of 2906 women,
61% of the women present at all the waves of data collection.
Data analysis
Propensity-score matching is a method of confounding control that
attempts to balance the distribution of confounders in the "treated"
(parous) and "untreated" (nulliparous) groups (16). One advantage
of propensity-score techniques over traditional regression is that pro-
pensity scores reduce the dimensionality of confounders: a single
propensity score summarizes information from many covariates (17).
Second, propensity-score methods allow one to more easily detect
"nonpositivity," when there are covariate patterns or combinations
of the values of observed confounders where either none or all
women are parous and in whom the effect of parity can thus not be
validly estimated (18).
First, to calculate propensity scores, we fit a logistic regression
model in which the main exposure, incident parity, was the out-
come. The predictor variables were childhood demographic charac-
teristics (described in next section). Next, each parous woman was
matched to one or more nulliparous women who had similar propen-
sity scores (19). We used nearest-neighbor matching to estimate the
average treatment effect in the treated (ATT) respondents, parous
women. Our main analysis matched nulliparous women to every
parous woman within calipers of 0.1 times the logit of the propen-
sity score. Finally, in this matched population, 7-year obesity inci-
dence between wave 3 and wave 4 among the parous women was
compared to obesity incidence among matched nulliparous women.
Each estimate of incidence difference had 95% Wald confidence
intervals (19).
Confounding control: Predictors in propensity score model.
For predictor variables, we chose confounders that temporally are
likely to precede the respondent's development of obesity and parity

and logically are unlikely to be affected by the respondent's incident
obesity (Figure 1). For instance, for most respondents, self-identified
racial classification was set in childhood before childbearing or obe-
sity onset and remained stable throughout adulthood (20). Another
example is parental education: because most parents would have
completed their education by age 25 years (21), parental education
is unlikely to be affected by the respondent's incident obesity or
parity. In contrast, we did not include factors such as the respond-
ent's adult income or marital status that could be shared effects of
parity and obesity. For instance, the likelihood of being married is
affected by both a woman's childbearing and her obesity status
(22,23). We assumed that adjusting for these shared effects could
cause collider stratification bias, a type of induced selection bias
(24,25); however, we did conduct analyses to evaluate the extent of
this potential source of bias.
The logistic model to predict "exposure" included demographic and
childhood characteristics that we hypothesized were on backdoor
pathways between parity and obesity status (Figure 1). The model
included the following covariates assessed at baseline (1994-1995):
unique indicator of the school attended, age, race/ethnicity, immigra-
tion status, U.S. census region, parental education, urbanicity status
of the school attended, and interactions and transformations of these
terms, described below. Specifically, the following variables were
included in the exposure model: unique ID of school attended at
wave 1; age; age2; nominal 4-level census region (South, Northeast,
Midwest, West); nominal school urbanicity (rural, urban, suburban);
interaction of census region and urbanicity; nominal 6-level parental
education; Black race; interaction of Black race and parental educa-
tion; non-US-born immigrant; interaction of immigrant and Black
race; Mexican ethnicity; Cuban ethnicity; Puerto Rican ethnicity;
Central American ethnicity; other Hispanic ethnicity; mixed His-
panic ethnicity; interaction of immigrant and Mexican ethnicity;
interaction of immigrant and Cuban ethnicity; five interaction terms
of immigrant and all Hispanic ethnicities except "mixed Hispanic
ethnicity"; Chinese ethnicity; Filipino ethnicity; Japanese ethnicity;
Asian Indian ethnicity; Korean ethnicity; Vietnamese ethnicity;
"other" Asian Ethnicity; and mixed Asian ethnicities.
Supplemental analyses. To examine whether propensity score
matching resulted in a different conclusion than a conventional
regression model with covariate adjustment, we fit supplemental
regression models to estimate the adjusted association between par-
ity and obesity. First, we fit regression models using a "standard"
set of covariates used in previous regression modeling of this topic
(7). These covariates were age, age2, rural/urban/suburban residence
at baseline, 4-level race/ethnicity (Black, White, Hispanic, other),
and a 3-level variable for mother's education.
Finally, we conducted a prevalence analysis, estimating the associa-
tion between parity at wave 4 and obesity at wave 4 without exclu-
sions for earlier parity or obesity status. Generally, incidence analy-
ses are preferred over prevalence analyses because prevalence
analyses may be subjected to bias from causation and differential
duration of prevalence of the outcome (26). However, the exclusions
required for incidence analysis may limit generalizability and cause
selection bias (24). By estimating the association using analyses sub-
ject to different sources of bias, we explored the robustness of our
findings. Moreover, as described in the Discussion, we believe that
reverse causation and differential outcome duration are unlikely to
have biased the results of this prevalence analysis.
Results
Table 1 shows characteristics of the analysis sample for incident
obesity before and after matching. About one-fifth of the respond-
ents (n 5 569, 21%) became parous between wave 2 and wave 3.
Before matching, the parous and nulliparous women differed on
childhood demographic and community factors. Women who
became parous were disproportionately more likely to grow up in
the South or a rural area and have parents who did not complete
high school. In general, Black and Hispanic women were more
likely to become parous than were White or Asian women. The dis-
tributions of propensity scores for women who experienced incident
parity between wave 2 and wave 3 and those who remained nulli-
parous at wave 3 showed overlap and little evidence of nonpositivity

(not shown). After 1:1 matching with replacement, differences
between parous and matched nulliparous women were reduced
across most variables (Table 1). Because we did not believe that the
distributions of these variables would be identical in the parous and
nulliparous groups, we do not present any P-values testing that null
hypothesis (27).
Differences in obesity incidence in matched
samples
Table 2 shows differences in 7-year obesity incidence between parous
and nulliparous women before and after propensity-score matching.
Before matching, obesity incidence was 3.2 percentage points greater
in parous versus nulliparous women: 19.3% of parous women became
obese between wave 3 and wave 4, whereas only 16.1%. of nullipar-
ous women became obese. Nearly all parous women could be
matched to a nulliparous woman, suggesting that the positivity
assumption was not violated in this analysis (18). In 1:1 matching
with no replacement, the estimated difference in obesity incidence
was reduced to 0.0 percentage points. In 1:1 matching with replace-
ment, the estimated incidence difference was 0.9 percentage points.
Supplemental regression analyses
We conducted regression analyses analogous to the matching analy-
ses. Generalized linear models with a binomial family distribution
and log and identity links that included the same covariates included
in the propensity-score model would not converge after 100 itera-
tions of log-likelihood maximization. However, the unadjusted and
adjusted estimates that could be fit were similar to the results from
matching with replacement. The main difference was that the confi-
dence intervals were more conservative in the propensity-score
matching analysis.
Analyses of prevalent parity and prevalent
obesity
We also performed a supplemental propensity-score analysis of the
relationship between prevalent parity and prevalent obesity. As
expected, about half the women (53%) were parous at wave 4. As
shown in Table 3, the unadjusted prevalence difference in obesity
was 7.3 percentage points (95% CI: 4.9, 9.6). The difference was
reduced to 0.6 percentage points (95% CI: 22.2, 3.3) and 20.9 per-
centage points (95% CI: 24.9, 3.2), respectively, for 1:1 matching
without replacement and 1:1 matching with replacement. Regression
results also suggested null associations after adjustment.
Discussion
We hypothesized that there would be a positive association between
childbearing and obesity prevalence in a contemporary population of
US women. However, in both incidence and prevalence analyses,
we estimated only a small, inconsequential association between par-
ity and obesity. In other words, if these associations are similar in
magnitude to the true causal effect, it appears that there would have
been little difference in obesity incidence in parous women in their
late 20s and early 30s if they had remained nulliparous.
Most of the literature on the relationship between parity and weight
status concerns postpartum weight retention in the first 12 months

after birth (28). These studies of short-term weight retention may
not reflect longer term effects of childbearing on weight gain (29).
For example, while a woman's weight may be greater a year after
childbirth than before childbearing, the difference may not reflect a
causal effect of childbearing on weight gain. Instead, the weight
gain may be attributable to secular trends or aging: had the woman
remained nulliparous, she may have still gained weight over time.
Ecological evidence supports the findings of the present study. Over
the past 35 years, age at first birth has increased, rates of adolescent
pregnancy have decreased, and lifetime parity has decreased even as
obesity prevalence among adolescent girls and young women has
increased dramatically (2,30). Further, in countries with low rates of
adult weight gain, there is little postpartum weight retention (31).
However, some observational studies of the association between
childbearing and excess weight gain have found positive associations
(6-9). The studies finding associations may have had limited ability
to control confounding (6-9) and measurement bias from self-
reported height and weight (7,8). In particular, because of the inter-
related timing of incident obesity and incident parity in a woman's
life, many studies exclude large proportions of their samples, i.e.,
50%, to conduct incidence analyses. The danger of this strategy is
that it could induce selection bias that produces confounding of
unpredictable magnitude and direction (25).
We hypothesized that greater confounding control would signifi-
cantly affect results, reducing the magnitude of a positive associa-
tion between childbearing and obesity. However, in the incidence
analysis, unadjusted associations were only weakly positive. There-
fore, our results may not differ from previous findings of positive
relationships because of confounding control; instead the association
between childbearing and obesity may be weaker in contemporary
cohorts.
It is notable that the unadjusted difference in incident obesity in
parous versus unmatched nulliparous women was not statistically
significant. By itself, restriction to a select population of nonobese,
nulliparous young women yielded reduced differences in confound-
ing factors between the parous and nulliparous women remaining in
the sample. Despite the lack of statistical difference in the
unmatched sample, it was still important to perform the propensity-
score analysis. First, the analysis controlled for residual confound-
ing, generating more valid estimates of the causal relationship
between childbearing and obesity. Compared to the estimate in the
unadjusted sample, the adjusted estimates were attenuated to the
null, strengthening our main conclusion. A second rationale for con-
ducting the propensity-score analysis is that propensity-score match-
ing allows one to more easily detect "nonpositivity," when there are
covariate patterns or combinations of the values of observed con-
founders in whom the effect of parity cannot be validly estimated.
Our analysis indicated that positivity was not a major problem here,
further strengthening our confidence in the results.
The lack of associations in the present study could be interpreted in
three ways. One explanation is that there is no effect of childbearing
on obesity incidence. Under this interpretation, many new mothers
who experience postpartum weight retention were already on a tra-
jectory of weight gain and would have become obese over the long
term, even if they had not had a child. Contemporary U.S. women
experience great weight gain in their teens, 20s, and 30s regardless
of pregnancy status (32,33).
A second interpretation of the results is that there is heterogeneity
of the effect of childbearing on excess weight gain: while child-
bearing may increase obesity risk in some women, it would
decrease risk in another group of women. Under this interpretation,
the marginal, or overall, effect estimated by this study masks ele-
vated risks and protective effects in population subgroups. For
instance, we plan to conduct additional analyses stratified by
demographic characteristics, such as race/ethnicity. If there is an
identifiable group of women for whom childbearing increases obe-
sity risk, then it is important to identify factors that can be

modified during pregnancy or postpartum. Additionally, women
who have lower postpartum weight versus prepartum weight may
be a target for interventions to maintain weight loss in new moth-
ers (3). Finally, a third interpretation of the null results is that the
observed associations are biased estimates of the true effect of
childbearing on obesity risk.
This analysis focuses more on the biological rather than social
effects of pregnancy and childbearing. For example, we restrict to
biological mothers and include full-term pregnancies that end in
stillbirth. Nevertheless, we recognize that the social aspects of child-
bearing are inseparable from the biological aspects. In fact, the life-
style changes associated with childrearing may be more important
than the physiological processes (34). Our estimate could include
multiple indirect effects, or pathways of action, including effects of
childbearing and childrearing on eating behaviors, disposable
income, and other risk factors for obesity.
This study has four major strengths. First, we analyzed data from a
large, diverse sample of contemporary women. Second, to decrease
bias from confounding and evaluate nonpositivity, we performed
propensity-score matching on a rich set of prepregnancy maternal
characteristics. Additionally, the ATT propensity-score matching
estimated translatable effect estimates, incidence and prevalence dif-
ferences relevant to target populations of contemporary young
parous women. Third, we had objectively measured data on height
and weight. Finally, we explored the possible influence of selection
bias and inadequate confounding control in our incidence analysis
by conducting supplemental analyses of prevalent parity and
obesity.
In the analysis of incident obesity, generalizability could be limited
because exclusions narrow the target population to women who
experienced relatively early childbearing and are also somewhat
resistant to obesity. Additionally, the selection bias could affect
validity (24,35). For example, if parity causes obesity, then in the
incidence analysis's restricted sample of women who were nonobese
at wave 3, parous women are those who managed to prevent obesity
despite childbearing; therefore they are uniquely resistant to weight
gain. As a result, a positive effect of parity on weight gain could be
underestimated unless one were able to control for all the factors
that predispose nonobese, parous women to be resistant to parity-
associated weight gain.
The analysis of prevalent obesity was not subject to these biases and
produced similar results as the analysis of incident obesity. Addi-
tionally, parous and nulliparous women in the prevalence analysis
had more similar distributions of propensity scores (Supporting
Information Figures 1 and 2). They were likely more exchangeable
than in the incidence analysis as a result of being near the U.S.
median age of first birth (36,37) at wave 4 (age range: 24-32 years).
Near the median age for first birth, there are many newly parous
women who are similar to nulliparous women who will become
parous in the near future and vice versa. However, prevalence differ-
ence is a valid estimate of the effect of childbearing (versus delay-
ing childbearing) on obesity prevalence only if there is neither dif-
ferential outcome duration nor reverse causation. We believe
differential outcome duration is likely to be small because obesity is
generally a persistent state in U.S. adolescents and adults (33).
Moreover, those at highest risk of obesity tend to have longest dura-
tion, which would bias results upward. In contrast, reverse causation
could bias the estimate downward if obesity decreases parity risk.
However, while obesity is associated with lower fecundity in clinical
settings (38), protective effects of obesity on parity may be negligi-
ble at the population level in contemporary women (39).
There are limitations to our analysis. First, our matching analysis
did not account for the complex survey sampling of the study. How-
ever, we attempted to account for the probability of sampling and
retention corrected by the survey weights by calculating propensity
scores using the variables that comprised the sample weights, i.e.,
race/ethnicity, parental education, the interaction of race/ethnicity
and parental education, and age. Further, controlling for clustering
would probably have increased the magnitude of the standard errors,
not affecting our interpretation of results. Second, to construct non-
pregnant, nonobese samples for the incidence analysis required
excluding a large proportion of eligible women because of their obe-
sity or parity status at waves 2 and 3. Third, we only accounted for
the relative timing of incident parity and incident obesity in crude
time intervals, defined by the three time points at which data were
collected on obesity status by the parent study. In particular, in the
incidence analysis, we did not take into account the incident parity
between wave 3 and wave 4 of women who were nulliparous at
wave 3. Additional restriction for births occurring between w3 and
w4 could introduce selection bias and, moreover, make it impossible
to ensure that parity occurred before obesity onset. However, failing
to consider the wave 3-wave 4 incident parity could have biased our
results towards the null. Finally, this study does not disentangle the
physiological, social, and psychological mechanisms through which
parity could affect obesity risk.
Future research may investigate whether childbearing has differential
effects on women, increasing prevalence for some women while
decreasing it for others. If heterogeneity exists, it is important to
investigate mechanisms by which childbearing is protective in some
women while putting others at risk. Potential targets for investiga-
tion include risk factors for gestational weight gain like prepreg-
nancy BMI, race and ethnicity, single versus partnered status, socio-
economic status, sleep patterns, mental health, eating habits,
physical activity, breast-feeding behavior, and smoking resumption
or continued cessation. Future research should also examine more
specific measures of adiposity or body composition and more long-
term postpartum weight retention. Finally, in most longitudinal stud-
ies, the timing of incident obesity is unobserved, making it difficult
to control for reverse causation without potentially inducing selec-
tion bias. To more precisely control for the complex timing of parity
and obesity will require time-to-event analyses with many measures
of weight to get at more precise timing of obesity. In summary, this
analysis of the relationship between parity and obesity provided lit-
tle evidence that childbearing contributes to obesity prevalence in
young U.S. women. Childbearing may not affect population-level
obesity incidence in a diverse, contemporary population of young
U.S. women. O
