number (R
0
), defined as the average number of secondary infections
per infectious person in a wholly-susceptible 
population without
interventions. We also calculated the age- and gender-specific equilib-
rium prevalence and contributions to R
0
. And we assessed the impact
of interventions by comparing reproduction numbers with and
without them. To assess the feasibility of opportunistic screening,
we analysed Market Scan, a commercial health insurance database,
to determine the proportion of people seeking medical care.
Results Treating symptomatic men and women who seek care and
screening 38% of women aged 15­24 years during annual examina-
tions more than halve the reproduction number. The equilibrium
age- and gender-specific prevalence of infection match those
observed in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
Men cause more secondary infections than women (contributing
twice as much to R
0
in some age groups), and people aged 25­29
years cause as many as those aged 20­24. Analysis of the Market
Scan database indicates that insured men seek care often enough for
screening to have substantial impact. Screening women reduces the
reproduction number by 3%; screening a similar proportion of
young men would reduce it another 4%.
Conclusions Our modelling suggests that screening men as well as
women and extending the upper age to 29 years may affect chla-
mydia transmission or sequelae.

BackgroundHomosexually active men are at increased risk for
human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV associated anal
cancer. Prophylactic HPV vaccines have maximum efficacy in peo-
ple who have not already been infected with HPV. This study aims
to determine the prevalence of HPV among teenage MSM.
Methods Same sex attracted males aged 16 to 20 were recruited in
Melbourne via clinics, universities, community events, media, social
networking and peer recruitment. At baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months
anal and penile swabs and an oral rinse were obtained to test for 37
HPV genotypes.
Results 200 men were recruited. At baseline 39% had at least one
type of HPV DNA detected from at least one site. High risk (HR),
low risk (LR) and quadrivalent vaccine (QV) preventable types were
detected in 31% (95% CI: 25­37%), 30% (95% CI: 24­37%) and 23%
(95% CI: 17­29%) of men respectively. Multiple types of any, HR,
LR and QV preventable HPV were detected in 27%, 13%, 11% and
8% of men respectively. The site specific prevalence of any HPV
detected from the oral cavity, penis and anus were 2%, 9% and 31%
respectively: the prevalence of QV preventable types at these 3 sites
was 0.5%, 4% and 20% respectively. Anal HPV was absent in 27 of
30 men who reported never receiving anal sex. Additional results of
serology for HPV 6/11/16 and 18 will also be presented.
Conclusion In this study, the first to focus on early HPV acquisi-
tion among teenage MSM, HPV was common but in the minority.
HPV vaccination prior to the onset of sexual activity is ideal; how-
ever, short of universal vaccination of school aged males, selected
vaccination of teenage same sex attracted young men could still
prevent many infections.

ConclusionsYoung adults reported that being tested for chla-
mydia had a positive impact on their willingness to engage with
future testing, and a smaller impact on subsequent sexual behav-
iour. The use of online surveys is warranted as the results were com-
parable to those of nationally representative population based
surveys. Addressing young adults' underlying attitudes towards
testing and perceptions of risk could increase their willingness to
test for chlamydia.
Strain Typing to Resolve Repeated Chlamydia
Trachomatis Infections in Young Heterosexual
Dutch Populations

Repeated infections of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) occur frequently
in young adults. These may be new infections, or persistent infec-
tions due to treatment failure or unresolved infections in sex part-
ners. We compared CT multilocus sequence typing (CT-MLST) to
ompA genotyping in discriminating new from persistent Chlamydia
infections. Samples from young heterosexual persons were selected
from Dutch screening implementation studies in Amsterdam and
Rotterdam, the Netherlands, between 2009 and 2011. Paired CT
positive samples at baseline (T0) and after 6 months (T1) were geno-
typed with 6 MLST loci which included: ompA, CT046, CT058,
CT144, CT172 and CT682. The uniqueness of Chlamydia strains was
assessed by adding samples from 256 heterosexuals in Amsterdam.
For 27 out of 34 persons with repeated infections, full MLST
types were obtained for paired samples. In 17 of these 27 persons a
multilocus (n = 13) or single locus variant (n = 4) was found, indicat-
ing new CT infections at T1. For 5 MLST discordant participants,
the ompA genovar was identical. The 10 persons with concordant
typing results were categorised as treatment failure (5 persons) or
unresolved infections (5 persons). A minimum spanning tree, gener-
ated from all cases and 256 reference samples showed large and small
clusters and singletons. Surprisingly, the persons with concordant
samples had CT strains that were either unique (singleton) or found
in small clusters. The median time between T0 and T1 did not differ
between the persons with concordant and discordant samples. The
number of sex partners before T0 however, was higher for the discor-
dant group. High resolution sequence typing was superior compared
to ompA typing in discriminating new from persisting Chlamydia
infections. Many persons (37%) showed exactly the same Chla-
mydia strain after 6 months indicating possible treatment failure.

Background Chlamydia is an important public health problem
associated with neonatal sequelae, pelvic inflammatory disease,
infertility, and ectopic pregnancy.
Methods Using a population model with 2 genders and ages 15­44
years in 5-year groups, but only heterosexual contacts, we evaluated
the impact of actual and hypothetical interventions on chlamydia in
the U.S. Parameters were obtained from the literature or estimated
from the National Health and Social Life Survey and Seattle Sex Sur-
vey. The model was calibrated by adjusting gender-specific probabili-
ties of infection on contact. We calculated the basic
