Introduction
Cultures have developed particular verbal behaviors and
politeness devices, which vary from language to language.
Based on their pragmatic and sociolinguistic parameters,
people in different countries use and interpret verbal behav-
iors rather differently, and these differences and the lack of
an awareness of these differences may cause misunderstand-
ings and communication breakdowns particularly when
cross-cultural communication takes place. Speech acts in
general and requests as one of the important speech acts are
very vulnerable to be misunderstood. It is believed that prag-
matic errors are considered by native speakers to be more
serious than phonological or syntactic errors (Kiok, 1995;
Thomas, 1983; Wolfson, 1989).
To make appropriate requests in another language, learn-
ers need to acquire both pragmatic and socio-pragmatic
knowledge to avoid being considered rude or impolite by
native speakers. So it seems vital for learners of a language
to acquire sufficient knowledge of speech acts of the target
language (in addition to grammatical knowledge and vocab-
ulary) to avoid these kinds of communication problems.
Cross-cultural investigations of speech act patterns in dif-
ferent languages can serve this purpose. They can find differ-
ent strategies native speakers use and also can pinpoint
similarities and differences across languages. Chen & Chen
(2007) mentioned,
This study was an effort to find the way native Persian
and English speakers use request strategies in their daily
interactions. Definitions of some technical words are pro-
vided prior to related literature.
Pragmatics
Pragmatics is the study of how language is affected by the
context in which it occurs. The aspects that can affect the
language can be the relationship between the speakers in a
conversation, the context, or preceding utterances (Parker &
Riley, 1994). According to Yule (1996), pragmatics is "the
study of intended speaker meaning" (p. 3). Pragmatic com-
petence, which is the ability to perform language functions
appropriately in social context, has been considered to be an
essential part of the communicative competence after several

Request Strategies in Everyday
Interactions of Persian and English
Speakers
Shiler Yazdanfar1 and Alireza Bonyadi1
Abstract
Cross-cultural studies of speech acts in different linguistic contexts might have interesting implications for language
researchers and practitioners. Drawing on the Speech Act Theory, the present study aimed at conducting a comparative
study of request speech act in Persian and English. Specifically, the study endeavored to explore the request strategies used
in daily interactions of Persian and English speakers based on directness level and supportive moves. To this end, English and
Persian TV series were observed and requestive utterances were transcribed. The utterances were then categorized based
on Blum-Kulka and Olshtain's Cross-Cultural Study of Speech Act Realization Pattern (CCSARP) for directness level and
internal and external mitigation devises. According to the results, although speakers of both languages opted for the direct
level as their most frequently used strategy in their daily interactions, the English speakers used more conventionally indirect
strategies than the Persian speakers did, and the Persian speakers used more non-conventionally indirect strategies than the
English speakers did. Furthermore, the analyzed data revealed the fact that American English speakers use more mitigation
devices in their daily interactions with friends and family members than Persian speakers.

theoretical models of communicative competence were
introduced by Canale and Swain (1980), Bachman (1990),
and Bachman and Palmer (1996). Before the emergence of
these models, for long years, second language ability had
been equated with linguistic accuracy, but it was proven that
mastery over grammatical forms and lexical and phonologi-
cal knowledge was not enough for successful communica-
tion and as Wannaruk (2008) mentioned, "communication
breakdowns can occur during cross-cultural communication
due to different perceptions and interpretations of appropri-
ateness and politeness" (p. 318). To be communicatively
competent, speakers should have the knowledge of using
language appropriately according to contextual factors.
Speech Acts
John Austin (1962) referred to speech acts for the first time
in his book How to Do Things With Words, where he said, "in
uttering a sentence one can do things as well as say things"
(cited in Parker & Riley, 1994). Speech acts are considered
to have three facets: a locutionary act (the description of
what somebody says), an illocutionary act (the speaker's
intention in uttering something), and a perlocutionary act
(the action done as a result of the illocutionary force of an
utterance).
Searle (1975) classified illocutionary acts into six types:
1. Representative: to describe state of affairs (confess-
ing, stating, asserting, etc.).
2. Directive: to have someone do something (request-
ing, forbidding, warning, ordering, etc.).
3. Question: to get someone to provide information
(asking, inquiring, etc.).
4. Comissive: to commit the speaker to do something
(promising, vowing, pledging, etc.).
5. Expressive: to express speaker's emotional state
(apologizing, thanking, congratulating).
6. Declaration: to change the status of some entity
(naming, appointing, resigning, etc.).
Direct Versus Indirect Illocutionary Act
Illocutionary acts are stated directly when syntactic form of
the utterance matches its illocutionary force. Each type of
sentences is associated with a particular illocutionary act, for
example, when an expressive is delivered by an exclamatory,
or a request by an imperative, it is delivered directly. In many
cases, especially in requests (a kind of directive), using a
direct speech act can be considered impolite or rude. So, to
mitigate or soften the effect of speech acts, speakers may
choose to state their utterances indirectly, that is, by using a
syntactic form, which does not match the illocutionary force
of the utterance (Parker & Riley, 1994). In addition to polite-
ness, Thomas (1983) believed that "people use indirect strat-
egies when they want to make their speech more interesting,
when they want to reach goals different from their partners,
or when they want to increase the face of the message com-
municated" (p. 143). Higher levels of indirectness are
believed to result in higher levels of politeness.
Politeness Theory
Politeness involves considering feelings of others and mak-
ing others feel comfortable. Goffman (1967) described
politeness as "the perception an individual shows to another
through avoidance or presentation of rituals" (p. 77).
Politeness serves to avoid conflicts, which may arise during
a conversation between the participants. One way of show-
ing politeness is to use indirect speech acts. According to
Brown and Levinson's (1978) politeness theory, "People
tend to choose indirect forms over direct ones to show polite-
ness, since being direct is face-threatening" (p. 78). Leech
(1983) mentioned it is possible to increase the degree of
politeness by using more indirect illocutions " . . . a) because
they increase the degree of optionality, and b) because the
most indirect the illocution is, the more diminished and ten-
tative its force tends to be" (p. 131).
Face and Face-Threatening Acts
(FTAs)
The idea of face was proposed by Erving Goffman in the
year 1967. He defined face as a mask that changes depending
on audience and the social interaction. The idea of face can
be different in different cultures and social circumstances.
Every speaker of a language has a self-image, which she or
wishes to maintain when she or he is in communication with
others. Face "can be lost, maintained, or enhanced and must
constantly be attended to in interactions" (Goffman, 2006,
pp. 299, 310). Brown and Levinson (1978) defined negative
face as our need to act without imposition and positive face
as our desire to be liked and admired by others. They use the
term face-threatening acts to refer to acts such as disapproval
or contempt, which challenge a person's positive face, and
acts such as requests for action, which limit a person's free-
dom and challenge his or her negative face. Many misunder-
standings and breakdowns in communication may result
from FTAs.
Negative and Positive Politeness
Based on which face people attempt to save, Brown and
Levinson (1987) mentioned two kinds of politeness: positive
politeness, which saves hearer's positive face and which
indicates solidarity with the audience. People show positive
politeness by using conversation strategies such as informal
pronunciation, slangs, and indirect requests. Negative polite-
ness, which saves hearer's negative face, indicates deference
and gives importance to others' wants and concerns. The
strategies used by people to show negative politeness can
Yazdanfar and Bonyadi 3
include indirect and impersonal requests and using mitigat-
ing devices such as please, might, and so on. Negative polite-
ness occurs when a social distance exists between the speaker
and audience.
Request Speech Act
Ellis (1994) defined requests as "an attempt on the part of the
speaker to get the hearer to perform or to stop performing
some kind of action" (p. 167). According to Searle's (1969)
classification of illocutionary acts, requests belong to the cat-
egory of directives, which are defined as "an attempt to get
the hearer to do an act which the speaker wants and which it
is not obvious that hearer will do in the normal course of
events of hearer's own accord" (p. 66). Brown and Levinson
(1987) categorized requests as FTA, because the speaker
imposes his or her will on the hearer. They suggest when
people want to do an FTA, they might try to mitigate its
effect on the hearer's face. Depending on the seriousness or
weightiness of the FTA, the speaker chooses different strate-
gies. Variables the speakers consider are the degree of impo-
sition, the relative power of the hearer, and the social
distance between the speaker and the hearer. Because a
request is a kind of imposition on the hearer, the speaker had
better avoid a direct request in most circumstances (Yule,
1996). It is vital that speakers use appropriate form of
requests; otherwise, they might look rude or impolite, and
this can lead to communication problems. According to
Brown and Levinson (1987) and Leech (1983), direct
requests are considered to be impolite, because they limit the
hearer's freedom, and indirectness is a way speakers prefer
to increase the degree of politeness.
Cross-Cultural Study of Speech Act
Realization Patterns (CCSARP)
This project is an effort to empirically study the speech
acts of requests and apologies in eight languages
(Australian English, American English, British English,
Canadian French, Danish, German, Hebrew, and Russian).
The goal of the project is to compare across these lan-
guages with respect to these speech acts and establish
native speakers' patterns and also find similarities and dif-
ferences between native and non-native speakers of men-
tioned languages. Based on decreasing degree of directness,
they classified requests strategies into three levels of
directness and nine strategy types (examples are provided
in Appendix A):
1. The most direct explicit level: including mood deriv-
able, explicit performatives, hedged performatives,
locution derivable, and scope stating.
2. The conventionally indirect level: including lan-
guage-specific suggestory formulas and reference to
preparatory condition.
3. The non-conventionally indirect level: including
strong hints and mild hints.
Modification Devices
To soften the impact of requests as FTAs, speakers also use
some external and internal modifications whose function can
be either to mitigate or aggravate the request.
External Modifiers
These modifiers, which are also called "Adjunct to the head
Acts," occur in the immediate context of the speech act, and
they are optional clauses, which indirectly modify the illocu-
tionary force. Some categories offered by Edmondson
(1981), Edmondson and House (1989), and House and
Kasper (1981) are as follows:
Checking on availability: for example, "Are you going in
the direction of the town? And if so, is it possible to join
you?" (Blum-Kulka & Olshtain, 1984, p. 205)
·
· Getting a pre-commitment: for example, "Will you do
me a favor? Could you perhaps lend me your notes for
a few days?" (p. 205)
·
· Grounder: for example, "Judith, I missed class yester-
day, could I borrow your notes?" (p. 205)
·
· Sweetener: for example, "You have beautiful hand-
writing, would it be possible to borrow your notes for
a few days?" (p. 205)
·
· Disarmer: for example, "Excuse me, I hope you don't
think I'm being forward, but is there any chance of a
lift home?" (p. 205)
·
· Cost minimizer: for example, "Pardon me, but could
you give me a lift, if you're going my way, as I just
missed the bus and there isn't another one for an
hour." (p. 205)
Internal Modifiers
These modifiers that appear within the speech act are sup-
portive moves, which can be either downgraders (to miti-
gate) or upgraders (to enhance) the illocutionary force of
the request.
A. Downgraders: which in turn are divided into
Syntactic downgraders and Lexical downgraders.
a. Syntactic downgraders:
·
· Interrogative: for example, "Could you do the clean-
ing up?" (p. 203)
·
· Negation: for example, "Look, excuse me. I wonder if
you wouldn't mind dropping me home?" (p. 203)
·
· Past tense: for example, "I wanted to ask for a post-
ponement." (p. 203)
4 SAGE Open
·
· Embedded "if" clause: for example, "I would appre-
ciate it if you left me alone." (p. 204)
b. Lexical (phrasal) downgraders:
·
· Consultative devices: for example, "Do you think I
could borrow your lecture notes from yesterday?"
(p. 204)
·
· Understaters: for example, "Could you tidy up a bit
before I start?" (p. 204)
·
· Hedges: for example, "It would really help if you did
something about the kitchen." (p. 204)
·
· Downtoners: for example, "Will you be able perhaps
to drive me?" (p. 204)
B. Upgraders:
·
· Intensifiers: for example, "Clean up this mess, it's dis-
gusting." (p. 204)
·
· Expletives: for example, "You still haven't cleaned up
that bloody mess!" (p. 204)
Related Literature
Research in the field of request speech acts can be divided
into three main categories: single language, interlanguage
pragmatic approach (ILP), and cross-cultural studies.
Single Language Studies
These studies investigated the request strategies in a single
language, without comparing it with other languages. Not
many studies fall in this group.
Rue, Zhang, and Shin (2007) investigated request strate-
gies in Korean. They attempted to study Korean native
speakers' use of request strategies in connection with the
level of directness. They also investigated the effect of power
and distance on the performance of request. The participants
were 12 office workers. CCSARP was applied to analyze
data. The results revealed Korean was based on status of
power. More indirect strategies are used for higher power
addressees. In general, speakers preferred conventionally
indirect request strategies.
In another study, Shams and Afghari (2011) investigated
the effect of gender and culture on the comprehensibility of
indirect requests using a questionnaire in Persian, including
20 items in each of which a situation was described and an
indirect request was implied. The participants were 30 peo-
ple (15 males and 15 females) from Gachsaran and 30 people
(15 males and 15 females) from Farokhshahr. The results
showed the significant effect of culture on the interpretation
of indirect speech act, whereas gender had no effect.
The notions of indirectness and politeness in the speech
act of requests were investigated by Felix-Brasdefer (2005)
among native speakers of Mexican Spanish in formal and
informal situations. The data were collected from four males
and six females using a role-play instrument. The results
revealed the more distant the relationship between the inter-
locutors is, the more indirect requests will be used.
ILP
These studies investigate the learners' development and use
of pragmatic knowledge in second language context. This
kind of research has been widely done in English as a Foreign
Language (EFL) and English as a second Language (ESL)
area. This part can be more divided into (a) studies that
investigated the importance of instruction and (b) those that
just investigated how SL learners approximate NSs in their
use of speech acts.
Studies that investigated the importance of instruction.Xiao-
le (2011) aimed at investigating the effect of explicit and
implicit instructions of request strategies on gaining the
pragmatic knowledge in online communication of Chinese
EFL learners. Two groups of learners (explicit group [EG]
and implicit group [IG]) were instructed differently and
were given a pre-test and a post-test consisting of a written
discourse completion task and a role-play. Results revealed
greater progress of the EG, which suggests the importance
of using consciousness-raising activities in teaching
pragmatics.
The importance of explicit teaching was also indicated in
the study done by Farahian, Rezaee, and Gholami (2012)
who studied the effectiveness of explicit instruction of refus-
als on four types of speech acts, namely, invitations, sugges-
tions, offers, and requests. Participants were 64 Iranian
intermediate university students aged 19 to 25. Based on the
findings, they came to conclusion that explicit instruction of
refusals increased second Language (SL) pragmatic ability
of the experimental group.
Vahid Dastjerdi and Rezvani (2010) did not come to the
same conclusion as Xiao-lee (2011) and Farahian et al.
(2012), for they showed both explicit and implicit instruc-
tions were effective on EFL learners'request strategies. They
studied the effect of two instructional paradigms, that is,
explicit versus implicit instruction on English learners' abil-
ity of using request speech acts. One hundred twenty Iranian
intermediate EFL learners were randomly divided into three
groups of EG, IG, and control group (CG). The results indi-
cated the significant effect of both explicit and implicit
instruction on learners' production of request strategies in
English:
Those that just investigated how SL learners approximate NSs in
their use of speech acts. Native Speakers (NS) Umar (2004)
compared the request strategies used by Arab learners of
English with the strategies used by native English speakers
(NESs). The participants were 20 Arab students in four Ara-
bic universities and 20 British students in three British
Yazdanfar and Bonyadi 5
universities. Using a discourse completion test (DCT) to
generate data, the researcher came to conclusion that the two
groups used similar strategies when making a request to
equals or people in higher rank. They used conventionally
indirect strategies in these conditions. For lower position
addressees, the Arabic sample has tendency toward using
more direct requests than the British. It was also found that
NESs use more semantic and syntactic modifiers; that is why
their requests appear to be more polite.
In another study, Jalilifar (2009) conducted a study on 69
BA and MA Persian EFL learners and 10 Australian native
speakers of English to find strategies used by each group. To
obtain data, he used a DCT. The results revealed that as pro-
ficiency level increases, learners' use of direct requests
decreases, but conventional and non-conventional, types of
requesting increase, and also there is overuse of direct
requests with lower level learners and overuse of conven-
tionally indirect requests with mid-level learners.
Degree of familiarity and social power were two factors
based on which Memarian (2012) investigated Persian grad-
uate students' use of request strategies. She aimed at deter-
mining any potential sign of pragmatic transfer from their
first language. She administered a DCT to 100 graduate stu-
dents studying at Eastern Mediterranean University and also
to two baseline groups of British English native speakers and
Persian native speakers. The data were coded according to
CCSARP and were analyzed by the use of SPSS program.
The results revealed possible signs of transfer regarding
some specific situations in the DCT. Some evidence was also
found regarding the development of interlanguage by Persian
graduate students. Iranians indicated a need for more educa-
tion on the choice of strategies with respect to factors of
social power and degree of familiarity.
Cross-Cultural Studies
These studies investigate how a particular speech act is real-
ized in different languages to find the patterns and strategies
native speakers of a language use and also to find the simi-
larities and differences between languages mostly to investi-
gate universal principles in speech act realizations.
Hilbig (2009) tried to explore request strategies in
Lithuanian and British English. The researcher used the prin-
ciples from Blum-Kulka, House, and Kasper's (1989)
CCSARP. The data were collected from 100 Lithuanian and
100 English university undergraduates using DCT and also
an open-ended questionnaire, which included 12 socially
divergent situations to prompt requests. According to the
findings, both groups used conventionally indirect requests,
but the Lithuanian respondents used more direct strategies
(e.g., imperatives) and non-conventionally indirect strategies
(e.g., hints) and Lithuanians had a tendency to use more posi-
tive politeness strategies.
Indirectness and politeness are areas in cross-cultural
studies that have attracted many researchers. Tawalbeh and
Al-Oqaily (2012), for instance, investigated the notion of
directness and politeness in requests of native Saudi Arabic
speakers in comparison with Native American English
speakers. A DCT consisting of 12 written situations was
given to 30 Saudi and American undergraduate students. The
results revealed that Americans used conventional indirect-
ness as their most favorite strategy. Depending on the power
and distance variables, Saudi students used varied kinds of
request strategies.
Request modification is another aspect of request strate-
gies, which have been investigated by researchers. In 2012,
Hans made a contrastive study of British English and
Mandarin Chinese to find the similarities and differences
between these two languages with regard to request modi-
fications used by speakers. Sixteen native speakers of
British English and 20 native speakers of Chinese per-
formed the role-plays, which were constructed in English
and Chinese. The results revealed the effect of some social
variables such as power and distance on the choice of
modifications.
In another study, Eslamirasekh (1993) made a cross-cul-
tural comparison of patterns in the requests of 50 and 50
American native speakers under the same social constraints.
She used controlled elicitation (open questionnaire) to gather
data and used CCSARP to code them based on the degree of
directness. According to the results, Persian speakers used
more direct requests than American speakers and more alert-
ers, supportive moves, and internal modifiers. These strate-
gies are used by Persian speakers to compensate for the level
of directness.
Studying all these articles, the researchers noticed there is
a gap in studies related to request speech act. First, few stud-
ies investigated the cross-cultural differences of requests in
Persian and English. To the researchers' best knowledge,
there is just one study with this topic, namely, Eslamirasekh
(1993), which was done almost a decade ago. Second, in
most of the cases, the tool in eliciting data was a role-play or
a DCT. As Tatton (2008) mentioned, "we might question
whether we can assume that the responses [gathered through
the use of the DCT] are reflective of what would occur in
natural discourse" (p. 2). He suggests that "further research
be done in this area using recordings of natural day-to-day
conversations" (p. 2). In the current study, the data will be
collected through a naturalistic view, that is, through examin-
ing request strategies used by speakers in English and Persian
TV series.
Research Questions
1. In their daily interactions, how do Persian and English
speakers use request strategies with regard to direct-
ness level?
2. In their daily interactions, how do English and
Persian speakers use request strategies with regard to
internal and external modification devices?
6 SAGE Open
Method
Corpus
The data were gathered through observing American English
andTVseries.The first 300 requestive utterances that appeared
in American TV series and the first 300 requestive utterances
that appeared in Persian TV series were transcribed.
Instruments/Materials
The tool for gathering data was through TV series conversations.
Fernandez-Guerra (2008) made a comparison of occurrences of
request strategies and mitigation devices inTVseries and spoken
corpora. Although some slight differences in some type of
requests were found, he claimed requesting behavior in TV
series resembles natural discourse and is a useful language
resource. The TV series chosen were Desperate Housewives, as
theAmerican English sample, and Ghalbe Yakhi (Frozen Hearts)
as the sample. Desperate Housewives is an American TV com-
edy-mystery-drama series directed by Marc Cherry, which aired
on ABC studio from 2004 until 2012 in eight seasons. It won
Primetime Emmy, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors' Guild
Award and was reported the most popular show with an audience
of almost 120 million. Ghalbe Yakhi is a home network enter-
tainment series in three seasons and 57 episodes. The reasons for
choosing these two series were their being teemed with everyday
conversations and thus being full of requestive utterances.
Procedure and Data Analysis
The classification proposed by Blum-Kulka and Olshtain
(1984) in CCSARP was applied. In this model, first three
segments are recognized for request utterances: (a) Address
Term, (b) Head Act, (c) Adjunct(s) to Head act. For example,
in the sentence,
Mary, would you lend me some money. I should pay my
tuition by the end of this week.
a. "Mary" is the Address term.
b. "would you . . . " is the Head act.
c. "I should pay . . . " is the Adjunct to Head act.
Only the Head act is realized in classifying the levels of
directness in requests.
To gather the data, all 600 requestive utterances were
placed under appropriate category in CCSARP directness
level, and the frequency of each category was calculated.
Also, they were categorized based on the used external and
internal mitigation devices (if any), and the frequency of
their appearance was calculated.
Data Analysis
This part deals with the distribution of request strategies used
by native Persian speakers (NPSs) and NESs in mentioned
TV series. To this end, the requests uttered in TV series in
Persian and English were transcribed and categorized accord-
ing to Blum-Kulka and Olshtain's (1989) model of direct-
ness levels and mitigation devices. Research questions are
mentioned prior to presenting the tables, which provide the
answers for the questions.
Research Question 1: In their daily interactions, how do
Persian and English speakers use request strategies with
regard to directness level?
Table 1 shows the frequency of different types of request
strategies used by English and Persian speakers.
As can be inferred from Table 1, although the majority of
speakers in both Persian and English series opted for mood
derivable strategy, NPSs used it more than NESs, 190 and
151 requests, respectively. NPSs also used explicit performa-
tives more often. They did not indicate a big difference in the
use of hedged performative, although NESs used this strat-
egy slightly more frequently than NPSs. NPSs also indicated
a greater interest in using Locution derivable strategy than
NESs did. They used it in 27 utterances, whereas NPSs used
it just in 13 requests. As can be inferred from Table 1, a sig-
nificant difference can be seen in the frequencies with which
English and Persian speakers used Scope stating. The English
used it almost 3 times as much as the Persian did, that is, 42
compared with 15 utterances. Numbers were closer with
regard to the suggestory formula. Another big difference can
be noticed in the seventh strategy, being reference to prepa-
ratory condition. NESs demonstrated a marked preference
for this strategy and used it as their second favored request
strategy, in 64 cases, whereas NPSs used it much less than
NESs did, that is, just in 19 requests. NPSs, however, opted
for strong hint as their second most frequent strategy and
used it in 27 requests; NESs used them in 13 requests. Mild
hints were absent in both NPSs and NESs requests. All in all,
there seems to be a difference in the request strategies NESs
and NPSs used in these TV series. Although both opted for
mood derivable, which belongs to the most direct level, as
the most frequent strategy they use in majority of their

requests, NESs used reference to preparatory condition, a
conventional indirect strategy much more than NPSs did,
and NPSs applied strong hint, in non-conventional indirect
level, with a higher frequency than NESs did. Examples of
English and Persian requests are given in Appendix B.
Research Question 2: In their daily interactions, how do
Persian and English speakers use request strategies with
regard to external and internal mitigation devices.
All 600 transcribed request strategies were categorized
once more based on different types of mitigation devices
used.Although all used strategies in both English and Persian
TV series would fit in one of the directness subcategories,
not all used strategies contained an internal or external miti-
gation device, that is, English and Persian speakers did not
use these devices in all the requests. Persian speakers used
these devices much less that the English speakers did. From
all 300 transcribed requests, only 67 requests contained a
mitigating device, whereas 119 transcribed English requests
consisted of at least one external or internal (or both) mitiga-
tion device. To be more precise,
All transcribed English requests: 300
English requests containing mitigation devices (internal,
external, and mixed): 135
All transcribed Persian requests: 300
Persian requests containing mitigation devices (internal,
external, and mixed): 70
The classification of external and internal mitigation devices
inthe currentstudyis basedonEdmondson(1981),Edmondson
and House (1989), and House and Kasper (1981), which is
mentioned in Blum-Kulka and Olshtain (1989). There are some
other classifications, which include other subcategories not
mentioned here. One of these subcategories is the word
"Please," which is a lexical downgrader. Because it is a very
common mitigation device, the researchers included it in Table
2. Used external mitigation devices are shown in Table 3.
As can be seen in Table 2, English speakers used more
internal mitigation devices in their daily interactions (110 out
of 300 transcribed requests) than Persian speakers (51 out of
300 transcribed requests). Interrogatives are the most fre-
quently used internal device by English speakers in the stud-
ied TV series. Understaters were the only devices that were
noticeably used more by Persian speakers. These devices are
some words such as "a bit," "small," and so on, which can
minimize the requested action or the object. The English also
used the politeness marker "please" much more frequently
than the Persian did. Examples of internal mitigation devices
are provided in Appendix C.
Compared with internal mitigation devices, external
devices were not used very often. However, Persian speakers
showed a greater tendency to use them. Among different
types of external mitigation devices, grounders (reasons)
were the most preferred strategies by both English and
Persian speakers.
In addition to mentioned external and internal mitigation
devices, there were some utterances in which two internal
mitigation devices or both internal and external mitigation
devices are used. These Mixed Mitigations were seen more in
English requests (N.16) than in Persian requests (N. 3). Some
examples are offered below:
English:
Could you possibly take it easy? (Interrogative and
downtoner)
I would really appreciate it if you said something.
(Embedding, intensifier, and hedge)
There is something I would like to ask you. Can't we just
work it out? (Getting a pre-commitment, negation, and
interrogative)
Man ye xaheshe kuchik azat daram. Mitunam karte shoma ro
dashte basham? (I need a little favor. Could I have your card?)
(Understate, interrogative, and getting a pre-commitment)
Ye toke pa tashrif miavarid? (Would you here come a sec-
ond?) (Understater and interrogator)
Mitunam ye xaheshi azat dashte basham? Mituni befres-
tish unvar? (May I ask for a favor? Can you send him
abroad?) (Getting a pre-commitment and interrogative)

Discussions of the Study
After classifying all request strategies uttered in Persian and
English TV series according to Blum-Kulka and Olshtain's
(1984) directness level, the researchers noticed both NESs
and NPSs used Mood derivable strategy as their most fre-
quently used strategy in their daily conversations. This strat-
egy belongs to the most direct level in the model proposed by
the abovementioned authors.
With regard to NPSs, this result accords with the findings
of Eslamirasekh (1993) that "Persian speakers use signifi-
cantly more direct strategies" (p. 91). However, it is in con-
trast with the findings of Shams and Afghari (2011) and
Salmani (2008) who believed that Iranian participants use
indirect requests rather than direct ones.
The preference of direct strategies by speakers of a lan-
guage cannot be taken as a proof that they are not polite.
According to Brown and Levinson's (1978) politeness the-
ory, people use indirect forms to indicate politeness.
Reexamining the concepts of politeness and indirectness,
Blum-Kulka (1987) investigated native speakers' percep-
tions of these two notions in Hebrew and English in a series
of experiments. He came to conclusion that the two concepts
are not necessarily parallel dimensions; rather, they are
believed to be different from each other.
Also, Brown and Levinson's (1978) two notion of nega-
tive and positive politeness can somehow be related to this
discussion. As Eslamirasekh (1993) mentioned, when inter-
preting a linguistic behavior, the social meanings implied
by these behaviors should also be considered. The members
of two cultures may not necessarily consider the directness
and indirectness similarly. Although indirectness and
politeness are usually connected, their social meaning may
be different in different cultures. According to Brown and
Levinson (1978), negative politeness is indicated by using
verbal strategies, which show deference and by avoiding
imposition. However, positive politeness is achieved by
indicating solidarity with the audience. Speakers show this
kind of politeness by using direct requests among other
strategies. Eslamirasekh (1993) referred to some research-
ers who have claimed that in Western world, politeness is
usually expressed by negative strategies. According to
results of the current study, Persian speakers used more
direct strategies, that is, they tend to use positive politeness,
a view that is supported by the findings of Eslamirasekh
(1993) when she reasoned that in cultures such as Iranian
culture, "acknowledgment of one's status as a member of
the group has greater importance in determining norms of
interaction than considerations of individual freedom"
(p. 97). So, there is a tendency in NPSs to use positive
politeness strategies more than negative ones.
According to the results of the study, NESs used mood
derivable as their most frequently strategy, too. This finding
is in contrast with the results of Eslamirasekh (1993), Jalilifar
(2009), and Yang (2009), in all of which, English speakers
used conventionally indirect requests more frequently.
There are some reasons considered by the researchers of
this study for these oppositions. First of all, in this study, the
frequency of request strategies used in everyday conversa-
tions was investigated. In our everyday conversations, most
of our requests are addressed to our friends or family mem-
bers with whom we do not feel the necessity of decreasing
the impact of our requests as much as when we communicate
with strangers or interlocutors who are in the position of
power. Furthermore, most of our daily requests are for small
tasks in which the degree of imposition is low, and as a result,
it does not necessitate the requestor to attempt to mitigate
them.
Second, in most of the previous studies, the tool for
eliciting the data has been DCT or its modified form
(open questionnaire in Eslamirasekh, 1993) whose reli-
ability has constantly been questioned by some research-
ers. As Nurani (2009) mentioned, "What people claim
they would say in the hypothetical situation is not neces-
sarily what they actually say in real situations" (p. 667).
As the current study used authentic data gathered from
the requests uttered in TV series, and as the conversations
in TV series have been proved to resemble the authentic
conversations (Fernandez-Guerra, 2008), the data gath-
ered from this study might be a better representative of
authentic conversations. Of course, it is necessary to
mention here that the researchers do not claim that the
results can be generalized to all conditions and situations
in different contexts.
However, NESs used conventionally indirect level more
with a higher frequency than NPSs did. This might be due to
the fact that Western cultures are under the construct of indi-
vidualism, which gives all human beings the right to think
and judge independently, and so it is associated with the con-
cept of autonomy (Brandon, 1994). As so, speakers of these
languages use strategies related to negative politeness, which
tends to indicate deference and gives special importance to
other people's time and concerns, and it includes strategies
such as indirect requests among others (Belza, 2008).
With regard to mitigation devices, according to the
results, the English speakers in the English TV series used
these devices to decrease the imposition of the requests
more than the Persian speakers. They preferred internal
mitigation devices to external ones. Because, in this study,
the requests addressed to interlocutors with the same
social position is investigated, it can be inferred that
American English speakers mitigate their requests when
they are addressing their friends and family members
more than speakers, which is again another evidence for
the importance they give for others' autonomy and the
employment of the negative politeness strategies, whereas
Yazdanfar and Bonyadi 9
for speakers, the expression of closeness and affiliation is
more important than considering others' autonomy. This
result is in contrast with Eslamirasekh (1993) who believes
that speakers use more supportive moves (external modi-
fiers) and internal modifiers to compensate for their indi-
rectness. The reason of this contradiction might be the fact
that in the mentioned study, there were some situations in
which the speakers addressed the requests to interlocutors
in higher social position. Furthermore, as mentioned
before, the tool of eliciting data was different.
Implications of the Study
The finding of the current study can indicate a number of
implications for Persian and English teachers in all educa-
tional setting, such as schools, institutes, and universities, in
recognizing the strategies used by native Persian and English
speakers in authentic conditions and teaching them to Persian
and English language learners to enhance their pragmatic
knowledge. As Politzer (1980) stated, pragmatic competence
is not created automatically; rather, it requires education, start-
ing from the first stages of language learning. Generally
speaking, the findings may positively contribute to the realm
of teaching pragmatics to language learners. The results can
also be beneficial for Persian and English learners, who can
avoid communication breakdowns by having familiarity with
the appropriate request strategies that NPSs and NESs use in
different contexts. According to Schmidt (1995), acquisition
must be with awareness and "learning requires awareness at
the time of learning" (p. 26). EFL and ESL learners must be
more alert of the differences between their native language
and the target language and exercise more precautions when
using this FTA. Furthermore, researchers who look for univer-
sal principles in different languages can use the results of this
study to compare them with similar researches to find out to
what extent the aspects that govern the appropriate use of SAs
in different languages vary from culture to culture. Speech
Acts (SA) Last but not least, educational policy makers, who
are responsible for making decisions about educational sys-
tem, can use the results of this study and similar studies to
bring significant changes in the practices of teaching and
learning Persian and English languages by incorporating strat-
egies that improve the learner's pragmatic awareness and lead
to more authenticity.
Appendix A
A Combination of Levels of Directness and Strategy Types.
Directness level Strategy types Examples
Direct 1.

the verb determines its illocutionary force as a
request, e.g., the imperative.
Close the door.
2.
Explicit performatives: where the illocutionary intent
of the utterance is explicitly named.
I'm asking you to close the door
3.
Hedged performatives: where the naming of
the illocutionary force is modified by hedging
expressions.
I would like to ask you to close the door.
I must ask you to close the door.
4.
Obligation statements: where the illocutionary point
is directly derivable from the semantic meaning of
the locution.
You should/will have to close the door.
5.

S's desire, intention that H carries out the act.
I want you to close the door.
Conventionally indirect 6.

suggestion to do.
Why don't you close the door?
7.
Query preparatory: where the utterance contains
reference to a preparatory condition (e.g., ability,
willingness or possibility to perform the act) as
conventionalized in any specific language.
Could you close the door, please?
Would you mind closing the door please?
Non-conventionally indirect 8.
Strong hint: where the utterance contains partial
reference to object or elements needed to
implement the act.
The door is open
9.
Mild hint: where no reference is made to the
request proper (or any of its elements) but
interpretation is possible from the context.
