Research
Periodontal disease is a common, multi-
factorial, chronic inflammatory disease that
involves degradation of tissues that support
teeth, including alveolar bone (jaw bone)
(Pihlstrom et al. 2005). Colonization by pre-
dominantly gram-negative bacteria arising
from dental plaque stimulates an inflamma-
tory response that in some individuals, results
in the breakdown of the connective tissue
surrounding teeth (Preshaw et al. 2004).
Periodontal disease can lead to tooth loss in
adults and has been linked to a number of
systemic disorders such as cardiovascular dis-
ease, stroke, and preterm birth (Pihlstrom
et al. 2005). Although environmental factors
have been implicated as possible risk factors
(Barbour et al. 1997; Saraiva et al. 2007), the
role of environmental toxins in the etiology of
this disease has received limited attention.
Cadmium is a ubiquitous toxicant in our
environment, and an estimated 2.3% of the
U.S. population has elevated levels of urine
cadmium (> 2 µg/g creatinine), a marker of
chronic exposure and body burden (Paschal
et al. 2000). Human exposure to Cd is pos-
sible from a number of sources, with smok-
ing being a major contributor (Paschal et al.
2000). Other sources of Cd include emissions
from industrial activities, including min-
ing, smelting, and manufacturing of batter-
ies, pigments, stabilizers, and alloys [Agency
for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
(ATSDR) 2008]. Cadmium is also present in
trace amounts in certain foods such as leafy
vegetables, potatoes, grains and seeds, liver and
kidney, and crustaceans and mollusks (Satarug
et al. 2003). Once in the body, Cd accumu-
lates in the kidney and liver and is excreted
slowly over several years (ATSDR 2008).
The pathologic effects of Cd on bone,
including the ability to promote inflamma-
tion, are pertinent to periodontal disease,
where disruption of the host inflammatory
response is considered a primary factor in
disease progression and subsequent alveolar
bone loss. The adverse effects of Cd expo-
sure on bone are well established (Järup
2003; Kazantzis 2004). Several epidemio-
logic studies have documented an associa-
tion of chronic low-level Cd exposure with
decreases in bone mineral density (BMD)
and osteoporosis (Åkesson et al. 2006; Alfvén
et al. 2000; Gallagher et al. 2008; Honda
et al. 2003; Schutte et al. 2008; Staessen et al.
1999). Data from experimental models sug-
gest that Cd disrupts the bone remodeling
process, decreases skeletal mineralization, and
enhances bone loss (Brzóska and Moniuszko-
Jakoniuk 2004). Cadmium exposure has also
been shown to stimulate, in a number of cell
types and tissues, the production of pros-
tanoids (e.g., prostaglandin E2), cytokines
[e.g., interleukins, tumor necrosis factor-
(TNF-)], and matrix metalloproteinases
(MMP) (Hemdan et al. 2006; Kirschvink
et al. 2005; Marth et al. 2000, 2001; Romare
and Lundholm 1999; Suzuki et al. 1989).
Based on this evidence, our hypothesis
was that, because of its ability to promote
inflammation and affect the bone remodel-
ing process, environmental Cd exposure may
be associated with periodontal disease. We
used data from the third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES
III), a nationally representative survey con-
ducted from 1988 through 1994 in the
United States. We placed particular emphasis
on accounting for exposures to environmental
tobacco smoke (ETS), which may potentially
confound the observed association between
Cd and periodontal disease.
Materials and Methods
Study participants. NHANES III identified
39,695 persons for sampling, of whom 33,994
were interviewed and 30,818 attended the
mobile examination center [National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS) 1996]. Dentate
individuals who were  13 years of age and
who lacked medical contraindications (n =
28,059) were eligible for periodontal assess-
ments (Westat, Inc. 1992). For the present
study, we were interested in adult periodon-
tal disease and included only participants
 18 years of age (n = 17,752). Among these,
we excluded participants who had no peri-
odontal assessment or a partial assessment
(n = 3,347) or invalid laboratory measurements
of urine Cd (n = 912) or of serum cotinine (a

Background: Periodontal disease is a complex, multifactorial, chronic inflammatory disease that
involves degradation of periodontal structures, including alveolar bone. Cadmium adversely affects
bone remodeling, and it is therefore possible that environmental Cd exposure may be a risk factor
for periodontal-disease­related bone loss.
Objective: We examined the relationship between environmental Cd exposure and perio
dontal
disease in U.S. adults.
Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from the third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III). We defined periodontal disease as clinical attachment loss of at
least 4 mm in > 10% of sites examined. We used multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analyses
to estimate the association between creatinine-corrected urinary Cd levels and periodontal disease.
Results: Of the 11,412 participants included in this study, 15.4% had periodontal disease. The age-
adjusted geometric mean urine Cd concentration (micrograms per gram creatinine) was significantly
higher among participants with periodontal disease [0.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.45­0.56]
than among those without periodontal disease (0.30; 95% CI, 0.28­0.31). Multivariable-adjusted
analyses, which included extensive adjustments for tobacco exposure, showed that a 3-fold increase
in creatinine-corrected urinary Cd concentrations [corresponding to an increment from the 25th
(0.18 µg/g) to the 75th (0.63 µg/g) percentile] was associated with 54% greater odds of prevalent
periodontal disease (odds ratio = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.26­1.87). We observed similar results among the
subset of participants who had limited exposure to tobacco, but only after removing six influential
observations.
Conclusion: Environmental Cd exposure was associated with higher odds of periodontal disease.

biomarker of exposure to ETS; n = 1,555).
We further excluded pregnant (n = 264) and
breast-feeding women (n = 100) to avoid the
effects of increased bone remodeling and also
transient changes to periodontal tissues during
these periods (Kalkwarf and Specker 2002;
Laine 2002; Sowers 1996). Overall, our study
population included 11,412 participants.
Urine Cd and creatinine measurements.
Details of the urine collection and Cd analysis
have been reported previously (Paschal et al.
2000). Briefly, during the physical examina-
tion, a 10-mL spot sample of urine was col-
lected from survey participants. Cadmium was
quantified by Zeeman effect graphite furnace
atomic absorption spectrophotometry with
a detection limit of approximately 0.01 ng/
mL (NCHS 2006). Each sample was analyzed
in duplicate, and mean measurements were
reported. Specimens with Cd concentrations
> 6 ng/mL were reanalyzed for confirmation
(Paschal et al. 2000). We used creatinine-
corrected urine Cd concentrations (micrograms
Cd per gram of creatinine) in our analyses.
Periodontal examination. Details of the
periodontal examinations have been previ-
ously described (Westat, Inc. 1992). Briefly,
six trained and calibrated dentists examined a
maximum of seven teeth of the upper jaw in
a randomly selected half-mouth (quadrant).
Similarly, a maximum of seven lower teeth
were also examined in a randomly selected
lower quadrant, giving a maximum possible
total of 14 teeth examined per participant.
Clinical measurements of periodontal disease
were done at two sites (mesiobuccal and buc-
cal) for each tooth. We focused our analysis on
clinical attachment loss, which is a measure of
the amount of periodontal tissue lost because
of the disease process. In NHANES III, clini-
cal attachment loss was the distance from the
cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to the base of
the sulcus measured (in millimeters) using a
National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR)
periodontal probe (Figure 1). We calculated
this distance by subtracting from the pocket
depth, the distance from the gingival mar-
gin to the CEJ. We used a case definition of
periodontitis as attachment loss of  4 mm in
> 10% of sites examined.
Assessment of tobacco exposure. Because
cigarette smoke is a major source of Cd in U.S.
adults (Paschal et al. 2000) and is also associated
with an increased risk of periodontal disease
(Tomar and Asma 2000), we considered it an
important potential confounder of any observed
association between Cd exposure and periodon-
tal disease. We incorporated into our study two
assessments of cigarette smoking. First, we used
serum cotinine, a biomarker of both active and
passive exposure to cigarette smoke. Serum coti-
nine was measured using isotope-dilution liquid
chromatography with tandem mass spectrom-
etry (Bernert et al. 1997), with a limit of detec-
tion of 0.05 ng/mL (NCHS 2006). Second, we
used pack-years of cigarette smoking, calculated
by multiplying the reported average number of
cigarettes smoked daily by the reported number
of years smoked and dividing this product by
20 (cigarettes per pack). In addition to ciga-
rette smoking, we used questionnaire-recorded
responses to categorize participants as never,
past, or current users of chewing tobacco, pipes,
and cigars. To estimate ETS exposure, we used,
in addition to serum cotinine, the response to a
questionnaire item: "At work, how many hours
per day are you close enough to people who
smoke so that you can smell the smoke?" To
account for potential exposure to ETS at home,
we included the number of smokers at the par-
ticipant's home (0 vs.  1) in our analyses.
Diabetes, BMD, and urinary albumin
measurements. We included in our analy-
ses certain systemic conditions that may
be potential confounders because of their
reported associations with both Cd expo-
sure and periodontal disease. We classified a
participant as having type 2 diabetes if he or
she reported a physician diagnosis of diabetes
(other than during pregnancy), reported tak-
ing prescription medications (either insulin
or oral agents) for diabetes, had a nonfasting
plasma glucose  11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL),
had a fasting plasma glucose  7.0 mmol/L
(126 mg/dL), or had a glycosylated hemoglo-
bin (HbA1c
) measurement > 6.1% (Perlstein
et al. 2008; Rohlfing et al. 2000).
Because studies have previously reported
associations between osteoporosis and peri-
odontal disease (Wactawski-Wende 2001), we
also included in our analyses total hip BMD
measurements to adjust for osteopenia and
osteoporosis. NHANES III measured BMD
using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
instrument (QDR 1000; Hologic, Waltham,
MA, USA), and verified data quality in a
quality control program (Wahner et al. 1994).
Urinary albumin concentrations were meas
ured using a solid-phase fluorescent immuno-
assay (Gunter et al. 1996). Urinary albumin
concentrations were dichotomized at 30 µg/
mL because concentrations above this level are
considered indicative of renal damage (Paschal
et al. 2000).
Statistical analysis. We examined sum-
mary statistics and scatter plots for key vari-
ables to identify outliers. We also studied
age-adjusted geometric mean urine Cd con-
centrations [age standardized to the 2000
U.S. census population using age categories
of 18­39, 40­59, and  60 years (Klein and
Schoenborn 2001)] and periodontitis within
key subject characteristics. Subsequently, we
used multivariable-adjusted logistic regression
to estimate the prevalence odds ratio (OR) of
having periodontal disease for increments in
loge
-transformed, creatinine-corrected urinary
Cd concentration. We report our results as
ORs for a 3-fold increase in urinary Cd [i.e.,
exp(
^
loge[Cd]
× ln[3])], which corresponds to
an increment in urine Cd concentration from
the 25th to the 75th percentile. The principal
models incorporated variables previously asso-
ciated with periodontal disease, including age
(years), sex, education of head of household
(< high school, some high school, or > high
school), ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Mexican American, other),
household income ( 100% of federal poverty
line or < 100% of federal poverty line), serum
cotinine (nanograms per milliliter), cigarette
smoking (0, > 0 to 9.9,  10 pack-years),
chewing tobacco (never, past, current user),
pipe smoking (never, past, current user), cigar
smoking (never, past, current user), number of
smokers at home (0 vs.  1), exposure to ETS
at work (yes vs. no), number of teeth missing,
BMD (grams per square centimeters), urine
albumin ( 30 µg/mL vs. > 30 µg/mL), blood
lead level (micrograms per deciliter), and type
2 diabetes (yes vs. no). We included survey
phase and examiner identification numbers
(coded 1 to 6) in the model to adjust for dif-
ferences between survey phases and variations
in the measurements of periodontitis (Slade
and Beck 1999).
We were concerned that the observed
association between Cd and periodontal dis-
ease may be confounded by active or passive
exposure to tobacco. We therefore under-
took parallel analyses restricted to participants
with limited tobacco exposure (never-users of
cigarettes, pipes, cigars, and chewing tobacco;
no reported smoker at home; no reported
exposure to smoke at work; serum cotinine
concentrations  10 ng/mL). Furthermore,
we were also concerned that the markers of
systemic conditions (diabetes, BMD, urinary
albumin) we included in our analyses may
not be confounders but rather intermediates

in the relation of Cd exposure to periodon-
tal disease. We, therefore, undertook addi-
tional analyses excluding these variables from
our logistic regression model to determine
if their exclusion would alter the observed
association between Cd and periodontal dis-
ease. We also excluded missing teeth vari-
ables from this analysis because tooth loss
may be a consequence of periodontal disease
rather than a confounder. Blood lead has
previously been associated with periodontal
disease, so we undertook analyses restricted
to participants with blood lead concentra-
tions < 3 µg/dL, which was the median
blood lead concentration in our participants.
For all data analyses, we used SAS version
9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA)
and accounted for the complex multistage
sampling design of NHANES III. For our
multivariable-adjusted logistic regression
analyses, we used DFBETA (or ) to iden-
tify observations that unduly influenced the
parameter estimates for creatinine-corrected
urinary Cd concentration [see Supplemental
Material for details (http://www.ehponline.
org/members/2009/0800312/suppl.pdf)]. We
identified influential points separately in mod-
els for the full cohort and the low-tobacco
group and provide results for analyses that
excluded these observations as well as results
when we retained these data.
Results
The median creatinine-corrected urine Cd
concentration of the participants in our study
was 0.34 µg/g creatinine, with the 5th and
95th percentiles being 0.03 and 1.37 µg/g
creatinine, respectively. The participants in
our study were 40.9 years of age, on average
(standard deviation = 17.2), and 52.3% were
female. Approximately 15% (n = 1,758) of
participants exhibited periodontal disease, as
defined by the presence of attachment loss
of at least 4 mm in > 10% of sites examined.
Urinary Cd levels tended to be higher among
participants who were female, were older,
had lower levels of formal education, were
of non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, or had
a household income below the federal pov-
erty line (Table 1). Indicators of exposure to
tobacco--including cigarette smoking, serum
cotinine, and exposure to cigarette smoke at
home and work--were positively associated
with age-adjusted urinary Cd concentrations.
We observed no remarkable associations
between age-adjusted urinary Cd concentra-
tions and pipe, cigar, or chewing tobacco use.
Blood lead, urine albumin, having type 2 dia-
betes, and missing teeth were positively associ-
ated with urinary Cd concentrations, whereas
BMD was inversely associated with urine Cd.
Notably, participants with periodontal disease
had significantly higher age-adjusted urinary
Cd concentrations than those without peri-
odontal disease (Table 1).
Similar to another report of periodontal
disease in NHANES III (Borrell et al. 2005),
cases of periodontal disease were significantly
more prevalent among participants who were
male, were older, had less formal education,
or had a lower household income (data not
shown). A significantly higher proportion
of current smokers had periodontal disease
compared with past- or never-smokers, and
the prevalence of periodontal disease was also

significantly higher with increasing serum
cotinine concentrations (data not shown).
Using multivariable-adjusted logistic
regression analyses, we observed that, for a
3-fold increment in creatinine-corrected uri-
nary Cd concentrations [equivalent to the
increment from the 25th (0.18 µg/g creatinine)
to the 75th (0.63 µg/g creatinine) percentile in
urinary Cd], the odds of having periodontal
disease increased by 54% [OR = 1.54; 95%
confidence interval (CI), 1.26­1.87; Table 2].
In this model, increasing age, male sex, having
less than high school education, non-Hispanic
black race/ethnicity, and household income
below the federal poverty line were also signifi-
cantly associated with increased odds of having
periodontal disease. Participants who indicated
up to 9.9 pack-years of smoking had increased
odds for periodontal disease (OR = 1.67;
95% CI, 1.06­2.61) compared with never-
smokers, an association similar to that for par-
ticipants reporting 10 or more pack-years of
smoking (OR = 1.44; 95% CI, 0.92­2.26).
Diabetes and having missing teeth were also
associated with increased odds of periodon-
titis. As expected, when all tobacco variables
were excluded from our analyses, the asso-
ciation between urinary Cd and peri
odontal
disease was notably stronger (OR = 1.87;
95% CI, 1.54­2.26).
In analyses restricted to participants with
blood lead concentrations < 3 µg/dL, the asso-
ciation between urine Cd concentrations and
periodontal disease remained significant (OR
= 2.09; 95% CI, 1.39­3.13). In other analyses
that excluded diabetes, BMD, renal dysfunc-
tion, and number of missing teeth, the asso-
ciation between Cd and periodontal disease
remained nearly identical to the fully adjusted
results (per tripling in creatinine-corrected
urinary Cd: OR = 1.52; 95% CI, 1.25­1.85;
Table 2). When the analysis was restricted
to participants with low tobacco exposure, a
3-fold increase in urinary Cd concentrations
corresponded to a 68% increase in the odds
of having periodontal disease (OR = 1.68;
95% CI, 1.26­2.24).
In our multivariable-adjusted logis-
tic regression analyses, we found that some
observations unduly influenced the parameter
estimate for creatinine-corrected urine Cd
concentrations. In analyses of data from our
whole study population, we identified five
observations that were deemed to be influen-
tial data points. When these observations were
retained in the model, the association between
urine Cd and periodontal disease remained
significant (OR = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.06­1.64).
In our analyses of participants with limited
tobacco exposure, we excluded six influential
observations. Retention of these data points
in the logistic regression model substantially
altered the association between urine Cd and
periodontal disease (OR = 1.05; 95% CI,
0.67­1.64). We provide a detailed discussion
of our rationale for the identification of outli-
ers and their characteristics [see Supplemental
Material for details (http://www.ehponline.
org/members/2009/0800312/suppl.pdf)].
Discussion
In the present study, we found that environ-
mental Cd exposure, as measured by creati-
nine-corrected urine Cd concentration, was
associated with increased odds of prevalent
periodontal disease in U.S. adults. In examin-
ing this association, we adjusted for smoking
and several other established risk factors for
periodontal disease that may potentially con-
found its observed relation to Cd exposure.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
epidemiologic study to report on the potential
association between environmental Cd expo-
sure and periodontal disease in U.S. adults.
Our findings are supported by the known
effects of Cd exposure on bone and other tis-
sues. Chronic low-level Cd exposure has been
linked to decreased BMD and osteoporosis in
a number of epidemiologic studies (Åkesson
et al. 2006; Alfvén et al. 2000; Honda et al.
2003; Staessen et al. 1999). These results have
been confirmed in animal experiments where
administration of low levels of Cd over peri-
ods of up to 24 months resulted in decreased
BMD and increased incidence of osteoporosis
(Brzóska and Moniuszko-Jakoniuk 2004). In
these experiments, the serum concentration
of cross-linking telopeptide of type 1 collagen
(a marker of bone resorption) was increased
whereas the activity of serum alkaline phos-
phatase (a marker of bone formation) was
decreased, indicating a disturbance of nor-
mal bone metabolism due to Cd exposure.
Data from a number of laboratory experi-
ments suggest that inflammatory mediators,
such as prostanoids, cytokines, and MMP,
may be responsible for these effects. In vitro
experiments have shown that Cd exposure
stimulates the production of prostaglandin
E2 in osteoblast-like cells (Suzuki et al. 1989).
Similarly, Cd promotes the release of calcium
from organ cultures of neonatal mouse calva-
ria, and this effect is dependent on the induc-
tion of the prostaglandin-synthesizing enzyme
cyclooxygenase-2 (Romare and Lundholm
1999). The effects of Cd on cytokines appear
to be dose dependent such that low concen-
trations of Cd increase the release of cytokines
(e.g., interleukin-1 and TNF-), but at higher
concentrations this effect is less prominent
(Marth et al. 2000).
The available evidence thus suggests that
Cd may further aggravate disturbances in the
bone remodeling process that are present in
periodontal disease. Periodontal disease is
caused by accumulation of plaque bacteria in
the gingival sulcus and subsequent release of
lipopolysaccharide and microbial peptides that
elicit a host inflammatory response (Preshaw
et al. 2004). With advancing disease, there
is destruction of periodontal ligament and
loss of attachment caused primarily by host-
derived enzymes (MMP) and inflammatory
mediators (prostaglandins and cytokines).
The latter are also responsible for the stimula-
tion of osteoclasts, which leads to resorption
of alveolar bone. Given the important role
of inflammation in periodontal disease, it is
plausible that environmental factors, such as
exposure to Cd, that stimulate the release of
inflammatory mediators may contribute to
periodontal-disease­related tissue destruction.

Cadmium and periodontal disease
Environmental Health Perspectives · volume 117 | number 5 | May 2009 743
Tobacco smoke contains many chemi-
cals that may elevate the risk for periodontal
disease (Barbour et al. 1997), and it is also a
major source of Cd exposure in U.S. adults
(Paschal et al. 2000). We therefore placed
particular emphasis on distinguishing the
relationship between Cd and periodontitis
from the effects of smoking. We adjusted
our analy
ses for cigarette smoking using
self-reported smoking behavior and serum
cotinine, a biomarker of exposure to tobacco
smoke. We also used questionnaire-recorded
responses to identify participants with expo-
sure to cigarette smoke in their home and
work environment. The relationship between
creatinine-corrected urinary Cd and peri-
odontal disease remained significant after we
introduced these variables into our multi-
variable-adjusted logistic regression model.
Without the inclusion of all tobacco variables
in our analyses, the association between uri-
nary Cd and periodontal disease was nota-
bly stronger than that reported in Table 2,
confirming the importance of tobacco expo-
sure in our study. Furthermore, we were con-
cerned that tobacco exposure may contain
several risk factors for periodontal disease that
may partially "compete" with Cd, obscur-
ing the observed association between Cd and
periodontal disease among tobacco users and
those exposed to high levels of ETS. It is pos-
sible that, among these individuals, other con-
stituents of tobacco smoke may promote the
development of periodontal disease to such an
extent that Cd exposure no longer has a sub-
stantial impact on risk. We therefore under-
took separate analyses among participants
with very low tobacco exposure and found
that the relationship between urinary Cd con-
centrations and periodontal disease was stron-
ger in this group than among our full study
population. However, this association was
strongly influenced by six observations that
markedly affected the parameter estimates for
the Cd variable in our regression analyses. We
therefore recommend caution in interpreting
the association between Cd and periodontal
disease observed in low-tobacco­exposed par-
ticipants because this was statistically signifi-
cant only upon removal of three influential
points (and we also excluded three additional
outliers). Although these observations repre-
sent a small proportion of cases in the low-
tobacco­exposed subgroup [see Supplemental
Material for details (http://www.ehponline.
org/members/2009/0800312/suppl.pdf)], it
is plausible that some residual confounding
by tobacco exposure remained in our analyses
and accounts for some or all of the association
between Cd and periodontal disease.
Environmental lead exposure was also a
potentially important confounder in our study
because blood lead levels have been associated
with periodontal-disease­related bone loss in
this population (Dye et al. 2002; Saraiva et al.
2007). Furthermore, lead exposure has been
linked with increased expression of MMP-9
(Barbosa et al. 2006), a protease that is also
elevated in periodontal disease (Söder et al. in
press). In addition to adjusting for blood lead
concentrations in our main analyses, we under-
took additional analyses restricted to partici-
pants with blood lead concentrations < 3 µg/dL
and found that the association between urine
Cd and periodontal disease was stronger.
The present study is limited primarily
by its cross-sectional design, which prevents
us from establishing a temporal relationship
between Cd exposure and periodontal dis-
ease. However, the use of urinary Cd, which
is a marker of long-term exposure, allowed
us to consider the effects of Cd exposure over
periods on the order of a decade or longer
(Lauwerys et al. 1994). Furthermore, it is
unlikely that reverse causality (periodontal dis-
ease affecting levels of Cd in urine) is responsi-
ble for the observed findings. In cross-sectional
studies that include older adults, as this one
does, survival to be in the cohort may be influ-
enced by the exposure of interest; if Cd expo-
sure increases the risk of mortality (Nawrot
et al. 2008), any resulting bias in our findings
would likely be toward under
estimating Cd's
association with periodontal disease. Although
our study is strengthened by a large sample size
and the use of detailed measures of a number
of important covariates, including exposure to
tobacco smoke, unmeasured or mismeasured
variables may have confounded the observed
association between environmental Cd expo-
sure and periodontal disease.
Widespread exposure and increasing
evidence of systemic health effects at levels
previously considered unimportant make envi-
ronmental Cd exposure a significant public
health issue. Although information on the oral
health effects of this toxicant remains limited,
our results suggest that Cd exposure may be an
important risk factor for periodontal disease in
adults. Prospective epidemiologic studies and
controlled animal experiments are needed to
confirm and elucidate the mechanisms behind
the findings of this study.
