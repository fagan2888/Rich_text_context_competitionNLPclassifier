Abstract
Objective: To analyse the effects of levosimendan infusions in advanced heart failure.
Methods: Patients with advanced heart failure treated with repeated levosimendan infusions were
retrospectively compared with controls. Clinical, blood and echocardiographic parameters were
obtained at baseline and after 12 months, and before and after each levosimendan infusion.
Hospitalizations for heart failure and in-hospital length of stay in the 6 months before enrolment
and after 6 and 12 months were recorded, along with 1-year mortality.
Results: Twenty-five patients treated with levosimendan and 25 controls were studied. After each
levosimendan infusion, ventricular function and various clinical and metabolic parameters were
improved. After 12months, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) had improved compared with
baseline in the levosimendan group. The 1-year mortality rate was similar in both groups. During the
6months before enrolment, hospitalizations were fewer in controls compared with the levosimendan
group; after 6 and 12months they increased in controls and decreased in the levosimendan group.
Seven patients were super-responders to levosimendan, with LVEF improving more than 20% and
hospitalizations being reduced at 12months compared with the rest of the levosimendan group.
Conclusion: Intermittent levosimendan improved LVEF and decreased hospitalizations in
advanced heart failure and represents a therapeutic option for patients whose disease is
worsening.

Introduction
The advanced stages of heart failure are
associated with a poor quality of life, with
frequent hospitalizations and the need for
inotropic support.1,2 Unlike other intropes,
the calcium sensitizer levosimendan does not
increase intracellular calcium concentration
but facilitates calcium binding to troponin
C,3 thus improving myocardial contractility
without an increase in oxygen consump-
tion.4 Moreover, levosimendan also acts as a
vasodilator through its effects on adenosine
triphosphate-activated potassium channels5
and has an intriguing pharmacokinetic pro-
file due to its long-acting metabolites.6
Apart from its use in acute heart failure in
selected patients as suggested in the
European Society of Cardiology (ESC)
guidelines,1 many single centre studies inves-
tigating the effects of pulsed levosimendan
infusions in chronic heart failure have
reported encouraging results.7­11 In the
Heart Failure Unit at San Luca Hospital,
Istituto Auxologico Italiano IRCCS, Milan,
Italy, a clinical protocol has been developed
to allow the use of levosimendan in patients
with New York Heart Association (NYHA)
class III heart failure, long-standing disease
and frequent hospitalizations,10,12 that is,
the `frequent flyers' of the INTERMACS
classification.13 The aim of this retrospective
study was to present a real-world experience
in the intermittent administration of levosi-
mendan, assessing its effects on morbidity,
mortality and hospitalizations in an open
comparison with patients not treated with
the drug.
Patients and methods
Patients
Patients with chronic systolic heart failure of
> 2 years' duration treated in the Heart
Failure Unit at San Luca Hospital, Istituto
Auxologico Italiano IRCCS, Milan, Italy,
from January 2013 to December 2014 whose
treatment was optimized following ESC
guidelines1 (including b-blockers, angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II
type 2 receptor inhibitors, aldosterone
inhibitors and diurectics) and who had
been treated with repeated levosimendan
infusions in accordance with the institu-
tional protocol10,12 were included in the
study. Patients with arterial hypotension or
severe renal failure (estimated glomerular
filtration rate < 30 ml/min) were excluded,
as treatment with levosimendan is not
indicated in such patients.7­10 Patients
with similar clinical characteristics who,
despite being eligible, did not receive
repeated levosimendan infusions, either
because they were not referred by their
physicians or because they refused the treat-
ment for personal or logistical reasons, were
used as controls.
Echocardiographic and blood parameters
were evaluated at baseline and after
12 months; during this period all patients
were treated according to the ESC guide-
lines.1 In addition, some patients from both
groups underwent intermittent outpatient
infusions of furosemide, and patients in the
levosimendan group followed an additional
programme of levosimendan infusions,
echocardiograms and blood tests.10
All patients provided written informed
consent. The study formed part of an insti-
tutional clinical protocol10,12 approved by
the Ethical Committee of the Istituto
Auxologico Italiano IRCCS (LEVOrep
09C716_2007) and conformed to the prin-
ciples of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Levosimendan treatment
The protocol for levosimendan infusion
has been described in detail elsewhere.10
Briefly, levosimendan (SimdaxÕ, Abbott
Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) was
administered intravenously without an ini-
tial loading dose, as a continuous infusion at
0.1­0.2 mg/kg per min, to a total dose of
362 Journal of International Medical Research 45(1)
12.5mg, which usually occurs within 24­48 h.
The number of infusions and the interval
between them were set for each patient
according to their clinical condition. In line
with previous experience,8,9,11 a cycle of three
infusions at 28-day intervals was performed
in all patients, with additional infusions being
given if a patient showed clinical worsening
at monthly follow-up visits.
Echocardiographic assessment
Echocardiographic examination, including
Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging ana-
lysis, was performed at baseline and at the
end of the 12-month follow-up period in all
patients. In addition, echocardiography was
performed in the levosimendan group within
12 h before and within 12 h after each infu-
sion of levosimendan,10,14 in accordance
with the recommendations of the American
Society of Echocardiography.15 At each
echocardiographic examination, left ven-
tricular ejection fraction (LVEF), estimated
systolic pulmonary artery pressure and left
ventricular end-diastolic volume were rec-
orded. Pulsed Doppler was used to assess
transmitral and pulmonary venous
flow in the apical four-chamber view.
Tissue Doppler velocities were acquired
at the septal and lateral annular sites.
Mitral inflow measurements included peak
early (E) and peak late (A) velocities,
the E/A ratio and the deceleration time of
E velocity. Pulmonary venous flow meas-
urements included peak systolic, diastolic,
atrial reversal velocities, systolic filling frac-
tion and duration of atrial reversal. The
early diastolic (E0) velocity at the septal and
lateral annular sites was measured using
tissue Doppler, and the E/E0 ratio was
calculated using the mean of the septal and
lateral E0 values. The severity of mitral
regurgitation was graded semi-quantita-
tively from minimal (grade 1) to severe
(grade 4) using colour-flow Doppler images
of the apical four-chamber view.
Assessment of blood parameters
Blood samples were taken to assess serum
creatinine (with the glomerular filtration
rate being estimated using the Cockroft­
Gault formula), serum electrolytes, haemo-
globin and plasma B-type natriuretic
peptide (BNP) levels (measured using the
Triage BNP TestÕ, Biosite, San Diego, CA,
USA, according to the manufacturer's
instructions) at baseline and at the end of
the 12-month follow-up period in all
patients. In addition, blood samples were
obtained within 12 h before and within 12 h
after each infusion of levosimendan for the
measurement of the same set of parameters
in the levosimendan group.
Assessment of outcomes
The primary endpoints considered were
mortality at 12 months and hospitalizations
for heart failure in the 0­6 month period and
the 0­12 month period of follow up. Both
the total number of hospitalizations and the
length of stay in hospital were recorded;
admissions to the Emergency Department
were not included. The number of hospital-
izations and in-hospital length of stay in the
6 months before the baseline evaluation
were used for comparison. Changes in clin-
ical, blood and echocardiographic param-
eters over the same observation periods were
used as secondary endpoints. All-cause mor-
tality was assessed at 12 months after
baseline.
Statistical analyses
Categorical variables were expressed as the
number of patients and percentages and
compared using the 2-test. Continuous
variables were expressed as the mean Æ SD
and compared using either the paired or
unpaired Student's t-test. A P-value < 0.05
was considered to be statistically significant.
All statistical analyses were performed using
Ortis et al. 363
OriginPro software version 7.0 (OriginLab,
Northampton, MA, USA).
Results
A total of 25 patients who had received
repeated levosimendan infusions were
included in the study, along with 25 patients
with similar clinical characteristics who were
eligible for levosimendan treatment but did
not receive it because they were not referred
by their physicians (n ¼ 10) or because treat-
ment was refused for personal or logistical
reasons (n ¼ 15) as controls. Baseline patient
characteristics are given in Table 1. No
statistically significant differences were
observed between the levosimendan and
control groups with regard to age, clinical
history, heart failure aetiology, comorbid-
ities, NYHA class, renal function, haemo-
globin level, medical treatment or the
cardiac and comorbid condition heart fail-
ure (3C-HF) score.16
A total of 16 patients received intermit-
tent outpatient infusions of furosemide, six
in the levosimendan group and 10 in the
control group.
Acute effects of levosimendan
The mean infusion time for levosimendan
was 32.8 h. A total of 147 infusions were
performed. Patients underwent a mean of
4.12 infusions (range 3­5), with a mean
interval between infusions of 56 days
(range 28­90 days) and a mean interval
between the baseline and last infusion of
7.1 months (range 3­10 months). No side
effects were observed apart from asymptom-
atic hypotension requiring a lower infusion
rate, which occurred in nine patients.
In the patients receiving levosimendan,
there was a statistically significant improve-
ment from baseline in both systolic and
diastolic function after the first infusion
(Table 2). There was also a reduction in
BNP levels, a clear improvement in renal
function, and a slight decrease in haemoglo-
bin and potassium levels (Table 2). Similar
effects were seen after each subsequent
levosimendan infusion (data not shown).
Follow-up results
After 12 months' follow-up, NYHA class
had remained stable in the levosimendan
group (2.75 Æ 0.26 at 12 months compared
with 2.96 Æ 0.32 at baseline), but had sig-
nificantly worsened in the control group
(3.23 Æ 0.21 at 12 months compared with
2.86 Æ 0.40 at baseline, P ¼ 0.047). At base-
line there were no differences between the
two groups with regard to echocardio-
graphic data (Table 1). However, after
12 months follow-up, there was a slight
improvement in LVEF (P ¼ 0.018) com-
pared with baseline in the levosimendan
group and a worsening of estimated pul-
monary pressure (P ¼ 0.02) in the control
group (Table 3). In the levosimendan group,
serum creatinine and estimated glomerular
filtration rate worsened compared with
baseline values, but did not differ from the
values observed in the control group
(Table 3). In the 43 patients for whom data
were available, BNP levels did not change
significantly in the levosimendan group
(n ¼ 23) but were higher at follow-up in the
control group (n ¼ 20) (P ¼ 0.046).
Mortality and hospitalization
After 12 months, mortality was similar in the
two groups: two patients in the control
group and three patients in the levosimen-
dan group had died (mortality rates of 8%
and 12%, respectively). In both groups the
mortality rate was lower than that predicted
by the baseline 3C-HF score (Table 1). In
the 6 months preceding the baseline analysis,
the number of hospitalizations and the in-
hospital length of stay were lower in the
364 Journal of International Medical Research 45(1)
control group than in the levosimendan
group (P ¼ 0.05 and P ¼ 0.02, respectively)
(Table 4). After 6 months' follow-up, the
number of hospitalizations and the length of
stay in hospital were reduced in the levosi-
mendan group, both in comparison with the
6 months before baseline (P ¼ 0.006 and
P ¼ 0.012, respectively) and with the control
group (P ¼ 0.012 and P ¼ 0.044, respect-
ively). There was an opposite trend seen in
the control group, with a progressive
increase in the number of hospitalizations
and the length of stay in hospital
from 6 months before baseline to after 6
and 12 months' follow-up (P < 0.001 and
P ¼ 0.002, respectively) (Table 4). After
12 months' follow-up, the number of hospi-
talizations in the levosimendan group
remained significantly lower than in the
control group (P < 0.009).

whether a similar favourable change had
also occurred in diastolic function. Clinical,
echocardiographic blood parameters, and
the number of hospitalizations and the in-
hospital length of stay in these patients
compared with the rest of the levosimendan
group are showed in Table 5. The super-
responder patients were significantly
younger than the remaining patients and in
all of them chronic systolic heart failure had
been diagnosed < 3 years before the start of
the study. Super-responders underwent
fewer drug infusions (3.86 Æ 0.90 in the
super-responders compared with 5.15 Æ
0.31 in the remaining patients; P ¼ 0.045),
had lower BNP levels (P ¼ 0.019), and had
fewer hospitalizations (P < 0.05) and a
shorter length of stay (P < 0.05) both at 6
and 12 months of follow-up compared with
the remaining patients in the levosimendan
group (Table 5); none of the super-respon-
ders died during the study period.
Discussion
In this retrospective analysis, experience
with the repeated use of levosimendan in
an ordinary heart failure unit is presented.
These results follow up on a randomized,
open-label, prospective study comparing
repeated infusions of levosimendan and
furosemide in advanced heart failure.10 In
both studies, although severely ill, the
patients were not those in whom temporary
inotropic support is considered,1 but they
fulfilled the criteria followed in most studies
for the use of levosimendan in chronic
advanced heart failure.8­10
In the population of unselected patients
in the present study, the acute effects of
levosimendan were similar to those reported
in randomized studies,8­12 with improved
left ventricular systolic and diastolic func-
tion and reduced BNP levels; moreover, the
effects were seen after every infusion of
levosimendan, with no apparent tolerance

developing over time. In the present study,
similar to previous studies,8­10 a trend
towards a better clinical state was observed
at follow-up in patients treated with levosi-
mendan: their NYHA class remained stable,
while it worsened in the control group, and
there was a slight improvement in LVEF.
Levels of BNP were not available in every
patient; although they did not change in
patients treated with levosimendan, they
worsened over time in the control group.
Taken together, despite the inherent weak-
nesses of a retrospective analysis, these
results are coherent with the hypothesis
that levosimendan might slow the progres-
sion of advanced heart failure.17,18
In the present study the mortality rate
was lower than that predicted by the base-
line 3C-HF score, and therefore a similar
survival rate in the two groups of patients
was not surprising. To date, a reduction in
mortality with levosimendan treatment
in chronic heart failure has been shown
only in meta-analyses17,18 and has not been
confirmed in randomized studies.19 In the
present study, the number of hospitaliza-
tions and the length of stay in hospital were
reduced in the levosimendan group
6 months after the beginning of treatment,
when patients were still undergoing repeated
infusions. After 12 months of follow-up,
most patients were no longer being treated
with regular infusions of the drug, which
may explain the trend towards relapse at
that time; however, both the number of
hospitalizations and the length of stay in
hospital were still lower than in the control
group, which is in line with the results
reported by Bartesaghi et al.20 who studied
levosimendan treatment in outpatients with
end-stage chronic heart failure and who thus
were more seriously ill than the patients in
the present study. The initial higher number
of hospitalizations and in-hospital length of
stay in patients treated with levosimendan
compared with patients who did not
undergo this treatment suggests the two
groups may be two different populations.
However, levosimendan infusions were
offered to the majority of control patients
(some eligible patients were not referred by
their attending physicians), and there were
no significant differences in clinical charac-
teristics between the two groups at baseline
(Table 1). During the follow-up period, the
trends in the number of hospitalizations and
in-hospital length of stay in the two groups
diverged and became reversed. It is worth
noting that many of the patients treated with
levosimendan would not have been eligible
for the drug after 6 months since they did
not require hospitalization during that time.
In a few patients, repeated infusions of
levosimendan was associated with an
improvement in LVEF, a long-lasting
decrease in BNP levels and a reduction in
the number and length of hospitalizations at
6 and 12 months; these patients were termed
super-responders. With respect to the other
patients in the levosimendan group, the
ventricles of these younger patients might
have carried a lesser degree of fibrosis and a
greater amount of viable myocardium
that was more responsive to the calcium-
sensitizing action of levosimendan.
The present study had a number of
limitations. First, it was a retrospective
analysis of data derived from the clinical
registry of single heart failure unit, so the
number of patients to be studied could not
be defined in advance. Moreover, the con-
trol group was chosen on the basis of the
more relevant clinical characteristics rather
than treatment being randomized. Finally,
the number of levosimendan infusions was
not predetermined (as in the previous ran-
domized study10) but was event-driven by
the clinical protocol, which is used by a
number of centres.20,21
The benefits of intermittent administra-
tion of levosimendan in patients with
advanced chronic heart failure are still
being debated.17­19,21 The present study
offers the perspective of a hospital-based
Ortis et al. 369
heart failure unit in which this drug has
previously been tested in pilot randomized
studies.10,12 Despite the limitations of the
present study, the results suggest that inter-
mittent levosimendan may represent an
option for patients whose disease is rapidly
worsening despite optimal treatment.
