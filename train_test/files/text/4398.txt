Abstract
Aim: To study the relationship between erectile dysfunction and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)/
metabolic syndrome (MetS).
Methods: This prospective study invited male patients with T2DM attending for a routine
outpatient check-up to complete two questionnaires. A general questionnaire was used to collect
demographic and clinical characteristics, while sexual function was assessed using the International
Index of Erectile Function scoring system. The prevalence of MetS in this patient population was
determined using information from the general questionnaire. Risk factors for erectile dysfunction
were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.
Results: A total of 175 patients provided valid questionnaires; of these, 148 (84.6%) had MetS. The
prevalence of erectile dysfunction was 90.9% (159/175) in the entire survey population compared
with 89.2% (132/148) in patients with MetS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the
following risk factors for erectile dysfunction in patients with T2DM and/or MetS: age, blood
pressure and duration of diabetes.
Conclusion: These current findings suggest that the MetS and its components have a negative
impact on male erectile function.

Introduction
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a general
term used to describe a group of metabolic
disorders that includes central obesity,
hypertension, hypertriglyceridaemia, low
levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C) and decreased glucose tolerance.1
The International Diabetes Federation Task
Force on Epidemiology and Prevention, the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute,
the American Heart Association, the World
Heart Federation, the International
Atherosclerosis Society, and the
International Association for the Study of
Obesity published a joint statement in order
to harmonize the definition of MetS. The
statement says that MetS can be diagnosed
with a body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m2
with any two of the following:1,2 (i) raised
triglycerides (TG) >150 mg/dl (>1.7 mmol/
l), or specific treatment for this lipid abnor-
mality; (ii) reduced HDL-C <40 mg/dl
(<1.04 mmol/l) in males, <50 mg/dl
(<1.29 mmol/l) in females, or specific treat-
ment for this lipid abnormality; (iii) raised
blood pressure: systolic blood pressure >
130 or diastolic blood pressure > 85 mmHg,
or treatment of previously diagnosed hyper-
tension; (iv) raised fasting plasma
glucose (FPG): >100 mg/dl (>5.6 mmol/l),
or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM).1,2 If FPG is >100 mg/dl
(>5.6 mmol/l), an oral glucose tolerance test
is strongly recommended, but is not neces-
sary to confirm the presence of MetS.2 If
BMI is >30 kg/m2, central obesity can be
assumed and waist circumference does not
need to be measured.2
The global epidemic of obesity and
T2DM has resulted in an increasing
number of patients suffering from MetS.3
This is of particular concern because of the
close association between MetS and cardio-
vascular disease (CVD).4 There is also
growing evidence that MetS might be asso-
ciated with male sexual dysfunction.5 With
this growing understanding of the close
associations between various pathological
states, T2DM, CVD, obesity, erectile dys-
function and hypogonadism are no longer
regarded as separate diseases in elderly
men.6 However, the relationship between
MetS, erectile dysfunction and hypogonad-
ism remains unclear and needs to be further
elucidated.7 The aims of this study were to
evaluate the prevalence of erectile dysfunc-
tion among patients with T2DM and/or
MetS, and to evaluate the relationship
between the components of MetS and male
sexual dysfunction.
Patients and methods
Study population
This prospective study enrolled consecutive
male patients with confirmed T2DM
between September 2011 and March 2012
in the Department of Urology, The First
Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine,
Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi
Province, China. T2DM was diagnosed
according to the American Diabetes
Association as follows:8 FPG ! 7.0 mmol/l,
random blood sugar !11.1 mmol/l or glu-
cose !11.1 mmol/l 2 h after an oral glucose
tolerance test. All of the patients had normal
thinking ability, were able to express inde-
pendent judgement and answer questions,
and were willing to co-operate with the
investigation. The inclusion criterion
was the confirmed diagnosis of T2DM,
while the exclusion criteria were as fol-
lows: presence of psychological disorders;

hyperprolactinaemia; primary hypogonad-
ism; pituitary tumours; bilateral/unilateral
cryptorchidism; testicular inflammation;
severe anaemia; prostate cancer; genital
malformations; spinal cord injury; genitour-
inary surgery; dysplasia; thyroid disease;
endocrine disorders (e.g. hyperthyroidism,
systemic lupus erythematosus); connective
tissue disease; cancer; blood diseases; severe
peripheral vascular disease; poor peripheral
perfusion; severe liver or kidney dysfunc-
tion; and other organic diseases.
Ethical approval for the study was pro-
vided by the Ethics Committee of Xi'an
Jiaotong University (no. 61-1203/R). All
participants provided written informed con-
sent and all were given free access to the
study results.
Investigational methods
The sample size and power were not pre-
determined before the study commenced as
it was a prospective study with a set time
period. Two questionnaires, a general ques-
tionnaire and a sexual function question-
naire, were distributed to patients with
T2DM who attended the hospital for a
routine outpatient check-up. The general
questionnaire asked questions regarding
age, occupation, residence, marital status,
educational status, family monthly income,
lifestyle, level of education, smoking status,
alcohol drinking status, exercise, and disease
history (hypertension [controlled by medi-
cation], T2DM and hyperlipidaemia, coron-
ary heart disease, arrhythmia, peripheral
vascular disease and brain vascular disease).
Patients answered questions regarding the
current status (normal or abnormal) of their
metabolic parameters, including blood cell
counts, myocardial enzyme levels, blood
glucose concentration, blood lipid levels,
liver function test results, and renal function
test results, which were later tested and
confirmed at the hospital. Whilst at the
hospital, the patients also had the following
parameters measured: blood pressure,
height, weight, waist circumference and hip
circumference.
The sexual function questionnaire con-
sisted of two parts: (i) patients who had not
had sexual intercourse within the past
6 months needed to answer about the time
span without sexual intercourse, night-time
or early-morning erections, and the reasons
for intercourse termination; and (ii) patients
who had had sexual intercourse within the
past 6 months completed the International
Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5).9 The
IIEF-5 consists of five questions, each
scored on a five-point ordinal scale (0­5),
where lower values represent poorer sexual
function. The questions address five areas
related to the patient's ability to achieve
and maintain an erection that resulted in
satisfactory intercourse over the previous
6 months. The possible scores for the IIEF-5
range from 1 to 25 (one question has scores
of 1­5). Patients with a score of !22 were
considered to have normal erectile function
and subjects with a score of <22 were
considered to have erectile dysfunction
( 7 ¼ severe erectile dysfunction; 8­11 ¼
moderate; 12­16 ¼ mild-to-moderate; 17­
21 ¼ mild). Patients completed the IIEF-5
questionnaire themselves under the supervi-
sion of trained medical staff. All question-
naires were then collected from the patients
by the medical staff.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 13.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. A univariate logistic regression
analysis of data from the entire survey
population was undertaken on the study
parameters after having selected potential
risk factors based on the published literature
and research. Multivariate logistic regres-
sion analysis of data from the entire survey
population was then undertaken on the
Chaudhary et al. 737
parameters that were either statistically sig-
nificant in the univariate logistic regression
analysis or on parameters that might have
some expected association with erectile dys-
function in order to determine the risk
factors for erectile dysfunction. The results
are expressed as odds ratio and 95% confi-
dence interval. A P-value <0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 186 questionnaires were distrib-
uted to male patients with T2DM attending
the hospital for a routine check-up. From
these men, the medical staff collected 175
(94.1%) valid questionnaires (11 of the 186
were incomplete; therefore, they were not
included in the study). Fifteen patients were
aged 40 years, 71 were aged 41 ­ 55, 55
were aged 56 ­ 70, and 34 were aged >70.
The mean Æ SD age of the entire survey
population (n ¼ 175) was 56.74 Æ 13.10 years
(range 35­80 years). Based on the informa-
tion provided in the general questionnaires,
148 patients (84.6%) met the criteria for a
diagnosis of MetS. The mean Æ SD age of
the MetS group (n ¼ 148) was 59.62 Æ 11.91
years (range 48­80 years). The mean Æ SD
age of the patients that had T2DM but not
MetS (n ¼ 27 [15.4%]) was 40.96 Æ 6.41
years (range 35­58 years).
Based on the information provided by the
IIEF-5 questionnaire, the prevalence rate of
erectile dysfunction was 90.9% (159/175) in
the entire survey population compared with
89.2% (132/148) in patients with MetS and
100.0% (27/27) in patients with T2DM
but not MetS. The rates of mild, mild-to-
moderate, moderate and severe erectile
dysfunction amongst the entire survey popu-
lation were 30.9% (54/175), 18.9% (33/175),
13.7% (24/175), and 27.4% (48/175),
respectively.
Univariate logistic regression analysis of
data from the entire survey population for
MetS and its components showed that dur-
ation of T2DM and serum TG levels were
significantly correlated with prevalence
of erectile dysfunction (P ¼ 0.002 and
P ¼ 0.029, respectively; Table 1). The longer
the duration of T2DM, the higher the preva-
lence of erectile dysfunction; and the higher
the TG levels, the higher the prevalence of
erectile dysfunction. BMI, FPG levels, dur-
ation of hypertension, HDL-C levels and the
presence of MetS itself were not associated
with risk of erectile dysfunction.
Prevalence rates of erectile dysfunction in
each age group of the entire survey popula-
tion were as follows: 40 years, 66.7% (10/
15); 41­55 years, 88.7% (63/71); 56­70
years, 94.5% (52/55); >70 years, 100.0%
(34/34). Univariate logistic regression

analysis of data from the entire survey
population showed that age was signifi-
cantly correlated with prevalence of erectile
dysfunction (P < 0.001, Table 1). The older
the patients, the higher the prevalence of
erectile dysfunction.
Univariate logistic regression analysis of
data from the entire survey population
showed that monthly income was signifi-
cantly correlated with prevalence of erectile
dysfunction (P ¼ 0.02, Table 1). The lower
the income, the higher the prevalence of
erectile dysfunction.
Univariate logistic regression analysis of
data from the entire survey population
showed that the levels of physical activity
were significantly correlated with prevalence
of erectile dysfunction (P < 0.001, Table 1).
The lower the level of physical activity, the
higher the prevalence of erectile dysfunction.
Univariate logistic regression analysis of
data from the entire survey population also
showed that blood pressure was significantly
correlated with prevalence of erectile dys-
function (P ¼ 0.015, Table 1). The higher the
blood pressure, the higher the prevalence of
erectile dysfunction. The remaining factors
such as educational status, smoking status,
alcohol drinking status, waist circumference,
hip circumference and weight were not
associated with risk of erectile dysfunction.
Multiple potential risk factors for erectile
dysfunction in male patients with T2DM
and/or MetS were used in a multivariate
logistic regression analysis of data from the
entire survey population. The results
showed that there were three risk factors
for erectile dysfunction: age, blood pressure
and duration of diabetes (Table 2).
Discussion
Metabolic syndrome has become a global
public health problem.3 The initial clinical
interest in this syndrome was due to its
association with CVD and the growing
epidemic of T2DM throughout the
world.10 There is a high degree of overlap
between the cause of erectile dysfunction
and CVD.11 With the global epidemic of
obesity and T2DM, research has demon-
strated that MetS has a secondary associ-
ation with male sexual dysfunction and that
erectile dysfunction is significantly asso-
ciated with MetS.12 Several studies have
evaluated the relationship between sexual
dysfunction and prevalence of MetS. In a
study of 236 male patients with MetS,
96.5% had erectile dysfunction, 39.6% loss
of libido, 22.7% premature ejaculation and
4.8% ejaculation delay.13 The phenomenon
of gonadal dysfunction was more common
in patients with MetS compared with
healthy individuals.12 In another study, of
2371 males aged 30­69 years, prevalence of
MetS was 34% in males >50 years of age.14
MetS was independently associated with a
decreased IIEF-5 score.14 It is worth noting
that this study also showed that there was a
higher proportion of moderate-to-severe
erectile dysfunction in older men (!50
years) with MetS compared with younger
men (<50 years) without MetS.14 A further
study of 393 male patients aged 40­70 years
with erectile dysfunction demonstrated that
MetS was significantly correlated with inci-
dence of moderate-to-severe ED,15 while
Demir et al. showed that a decrease in the
erectile dysfunction symptom score was
significantly correlated with an increase in
the number of metabolic risk factors.16 The
Massachusetts Male Aging Study further
confirmed that the presence of MetS was still
associated with an increased risk of erectile
dysfunction even in a population whose
BMI was <25 kg/m2 (relative risk 2.09).17
The results of this present study showed
that increasing age was significantly asso-
ciated with an increase in prevalence of
erectile dysfunction. Univariate and multi-
variate logistic regression analyses demon-
strated that age, duration of T2DM, TG
levels, blood pressure, monthly income and
physical activity were risk factors for erectile
Chaudhary et al. 739
dysfunction in patients with T2DM and/or
MetS. These current findings suggest that
MetS and its components have a negative
impact on male erectile function, and the
relationship between the duration of T2DM
was particularly significant with erectile
dysfunction. This study was limited by the
fact that the sample size and power were not
predetermined before the start.
In conclusion, these current findings sug-
gest that patients with erectile dysfunction
should be carefully examined to see if they
have T2DM and/or MetS. Conversely, when
managing male patients with T2DM and/or
MetS, medical staff should be aware of the
potential impact that these diseases have on
sexual function and they should actively
enquire about the patient's experience of
erectile dysfunction.
