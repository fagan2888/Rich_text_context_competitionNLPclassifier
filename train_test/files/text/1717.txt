Introduction
The metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cluster of metabolic abnor-
malities with insulin resistance originally considered to be a
major characteristic (1). In recent years, the syndrome has
been broadened to encompass features as central obesity, glu-
cose intolerance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, a
proinflammatory state with increases in acute-phase reactants,
and a prothrombotic state. MS was defined as the presence of
at least three of the following criteria in Adult Treatment Panel
(ATP) III 2001: (i) waist >102cm in men or >88cm in women,
(ii) serum triglyceride (TG) >150mg/dl, (iii) high-density lipo-
protein cholesterol (HDL-C) <40mg/dl in men and <50mg/dl
in women, (iv) systolic blood pressure (SBP) >130mmHg or
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >85mmHg, and (v) fasting
glucose >110mg/dl (2). The International Diabetes Foundation
MS consensus definition requires ethnicity-specific central
obesity plus two other factors (fasting glucose criterion set at
100mg/dl) (3).
RecentstudiesfoundthattheattempttorelateMSastheresult
of insulin resistance is problematic (4). On the other hand, evi-
dence points out that chronic systemic inflammation plays a
major role in the pathological process associated with the MS.
The serum levels of an inflammatory marker, C-reactive pro-
tein (CRP), not only correlate with all components of MS but
also correlate with insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction,
and impaired fibrinolysis (5,6). It is likely that the proinflam-
matory state of obesity induces insulin resistance, triggers a
vicious cycle of positive reinforcement between inflammation
and insulin resistance, and leads to clinical and biochemical
manifestations of MS (7,8).
Previous attempts to explore and model the complex inter-
action among the metabolic components were attempted with
various statistical models, such as principal component and
factor analysis. Haffner and colleagues verified the existence of
a single factor that linked all of the core components (9). Also,
Ford showed that patterns of factors of variables, often asso-
ciated with MS, tended to be similar among whites, African
Americans, and Mexican Americans (10). However, the inter-
action among various components of MS is far more com-
plicated than what conventional statistical methods can deal
with. Issues such as the sequential relationship, mutual con-
founding, and relative impacts among each component must

The objective of this study was to examine the role of obesity in the development of the metabolic syndrome (MS).
A total of 3,596 whites aged 19 years and above, who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) 1999­2002, were included for analysis. Anthropometric measurements, biochemical profiles,
and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. A structural equation model (SEM) was constructed
to elucidate a pathway in which obesity initiated the cascade leading to full MS. The results of SEM demonstrated
that obesity was positively associated with elevated CRP level (B = 0.05, P < 0.001). This higher inflammatory state
directed to insulin resistance (B = 0.32, P < 0.001), which in turn was positively associated with dyslipidemia (B = 0.06,
P < 0.001). Obesity could also directly and positively affect blood pressure (B = 0.51, P < 0.001), without the mediation
of insulin resistance and/or inflammation. The results of the cross-sectional analysis in the white subjects have shown
that obesity has a strong influence on hypertension that obtains little additional influence from inflammation or insulin
resistance. The metabolic profile in the NHANES group has been confirmatory with the statement that there is a
sequential effect from obesity to inflammation, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. This approach has allowed to
inferring important biological insights about the nature of the relationships among the components of MS.

be considered as a whole, which is the superiority of struc-
tural equation modeling. Structural equation model (SEM),
sometimes called causal models, is a technique encompass-
ing aspects of confirmatory factor analysis, path analysis, and
regression simultaneously (11). Lin et al. have demonstrated
that SEM could be used to explore the association between
metabolic risk factors and atherosclerotic complications and
also the relative contribution of each metabolic derangement
(12,13).
According to current understanding of MS, we built a bio-
logical model for the pathogenesis of MS, and verified the com-
parability of the model with the data from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999­2002.
Methods and Procedures
Study design and population
The NHANES is a population-based survey designed to collect infor-
mationonthehealthandnutritionoftheUShouseholdpopulation.The
NHANES used a stratified and cluster-sampling design to obtain a rep-
resentative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian US population.
The survey data are released every 2 years. Detailed Survey Operations
Manuals, Consent Documents, and Brochures of the NHANES 1999­
2002 are available in the NHANES website. None of the authors has a
direct involvement in the NHANES study.
Anthropometric and biochemical data
Data were collected at all study sites by trained personnel according to
standardized procedures. Sociodemographic information such as age,
gender, and race/ethnicity was collected during the household inter-
view. Laboratory measurements were performed in a mobile examina-
tion center. Weight and height were measured using standard methods
and digitally recorded. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by the square of height in meters. Waist circumference was
measured at the iliac crest to the nearest 0.1cm. Three and sometimes
four blood pressure (BP) determinations were taken using a mercury
sphygmomanometer by a physician. BP was measured in the right arm
unless otherwise specified. Averaged SBP and DBP were obtained.
Fasting blood was sampled, processed locally, then stored and shipped
to central laboratories for analysis. Levels of total serum cholesterol and
TGs (measured in the morning examination session only) were measured
enzymatically, levels of HDL-C were measured using precipitation, and
levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were calculated
using the Friedewald equation. Plasma glucose levels were processed by
using hexokinase enzymatical method. Serum insulin levels were deter-
mined by radioimmunoassay. Serum CRP levels were measured by latex-
enhanced nephelometry.
Data restriction
Lipid and glucose profiles in the African Americans and the Hispanics
intheNHANESdatasetweremostlyincomplete.Therefore,theanalysis
was restricted to the white participants aged 19. Subjects with medica-
tion, such as antihypertensive, oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin, and
lipid-lowering agents, were excluded so as not to distort the estimation
of the relationship among CRP, glucose, lipid profile, and BP.
Statistics
The comparison between anthropometric and biochemical measure-
ments was made between men and women by Student's t-test. The prev-
alenceofMS,withATPIII2001criteriawhenNHANES1999­2002was
conducted, and individual components was compared with 2-test.
SEM
A SEM was used to confirm the hypothesis that obesity (OBE) played
the initiating role and was sequentially followed by inflammation
(INF), insulin resistance (IR), and then dyslipidemia (DYSLIPID).
Hypertension (HTN) could be directly associated with OBE or related
to OBE through the intermediation of INF or IR. The model depicted
a biological pathway from OBE to INF, from INF to IR, and then from
IR to DYSLIPID. On the other hand, OBE, INF, and IR could associate
with HTN directly. Potential confounding factors, including sex, age,
and smoking status were adjusted by controlling their effects on the five
latent variables (OBE, HTN, INF, IR, and DYSLIPID) (Figure 1a).
The latent variable OBE loaded on both BMI (
11
) and waist circum-
ference (WC, 
12
), indicating that an increased waist size might provide
additional information for defining obesity. Inflammation (INF) could
be solely represented by serum CRP level (CRP, 
21
). Insulin resistance
(IR) loaded on insulin level (INSULIN, 
31
) and the homeostatic model
assessment (HOMA, 
32
). Fasting glucose level was not used because it
was already a part of calculation of HOMA. Dyslipidemia (DYSLIPID)
was represented as serum levels of TG (
41
), LDL (
42
), and HDL (
43
).
Hypertension (HTN) loaded on both SBP (
51
) and DBP (
52
). Each
latent variable might be interpreted as a linear combination of manifest
variables of relative significance. Loading factors ( s) are allowed to have
values >1 after correlation adjustment.
The correlation matrix between the manifest variables (BMI, waist
circumference, CRP, INSULIN, HOMA, TG, LDL, HDL, SBP, DBP, AGE,
SEX, and SMOKING) was calculated with the execution of a SIMPLIS
code on a pair-wise basis. Pearson correlation, polyserial correlation,
and polychoric correlation were used for two continuous variables,

one continuous and one ordinal variable, and two ordinal variables,
respectively.
The correlation matrix was imported into a LISREL program (LISREL
8.71; Scientific Software International, Lincolnwood, IL) to estimate the
parameters in the SEM. The links between any two latent variables were
removed when the regression coefficients did not reach statistical signifi-
cance (P > 0.05). The model was repeated stepwise until all the links were
significant. Another iteration process began and set the errors between
any two manifest variables correlated rather than independent if statistical
significance was found. The correlation specification between error terms
was iterated until the goodness-of-fit index was >0.90, the non-normed
fit index was >0.90, and the root mean square error of approximation was
0.05. The regression coefficients between latent variables (B), the loading
factors from the latent variables onto the manifest variables (), model
fitness, and the residual correlation matrix were reported.
Results
Demography
A total of 3,596 whites were included for following analysis. No
subject was further excluded on a list-wise basis due to incom-
plete data collection. The mean age was 48.4 ± 19.9 (n = 1,704) for
men and 44.9 ± 19.6 for women (n = 1,892). The anthropometric
measurements and the laboratory results were shown in Table 1.
Data completion rate ranged from 29 (LDL) to 87% (CRP). Men
had significantly higher serum insulin, higher fasting glucose, but
lower CRP levels compared with those of women. BMI, waist, BP,
and lipid profiles were not different between men and women.
The prevalence of abnormal metabolic components and MS were
summarized in Table 1. Based on ATP III (2001) criteria, a higher
proportion of women had central obesity, whereas a higher pro-
portion of men reached the definition of elevated BP and glucose
intolerance. The crude prevalence of MS was 21.5 and 20.5% for
men and women, respectively.
SEM
The results of the complex interactions between the main com-
ponents of MS were conceptualized in Figure 1b. After adjust-
ment of the effect of age, sex, and smoking, the SEM showed
that OBE led to INF (B
12
= 0.05, P < 0.001), which in turn led
to IR (B
23
= 0.32, P < 0.001). Consequently, IR directed to
DYSLIPID (B
34
= 0.06, P < 0.001). The parameter (B) was the
same as a regression coefficient in a multiple linear regression
model. Each s.d. above the average in OBE would be associated
with and predictive of 0.05s.d. increase in INF (B
12
). Although
OBE only explained a small portion of variance of INF, this
link was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The correlation
between OBE and HTN was stronger. Each s.d. increase in
OBE was associated with 0.51 SD (B
15
, P < 0.001) increase in
BP. However, the links from INF to HTN and from IR to HTN
were not statistically significant, and therefore, removed from
the model. The final parameter estimates and model fitness of
SEM were summarized in Table 2.
Confirmatory factor analysis of the SEM demonstrated that
in addition to BMI (
11
= 0.54), waist circumference provided
information for defining the severity of OBE (
12
= 1.66, P <
0.001) in spite of a high correlation between the two meas-
ures (0.925, P < 0.001). CRP alone could represent the extent
of inflammation (
21
= 1.05). The correlation between fasting
glucose and insulin, and between fasting glucose and HOMA
was 0.272 (P < 0.001) and 0.573 (P < 0.001), respectively.
Although there was a near-linear correlation between insulin
and HOMA (r = 0.914, P < 0.001), confirmatory factor analy-
sis was still able to find statistically significant loadings onto
these two factors. IR could be best represented by increased
insulin level (
31
= 0.82) and worsening HOMA (
32
= 1.12,
P < 0.001). Dyslipidemia was manifested as increased TG
(
41
=0.38),increasedLDL(
42
=0.80,P<0.001),anddecreased
HDL (
43
= -0.14, P < 0.001). HTN loaded positively to both
SBP (
51
= 1.46) and DBP (
52
= 0.21, P < 0.001).
In terms of model fitness, goodness-of-fit index was 0.98
and non-normed fit index was 0.91. Root mean square error
of approximation was equal to 0.05. All of these indicators
showed a good fitness of the data to the final model. The com-
plex interaction between variables in these subjects could be
perfectly conceptualized by the structure shown in Figure 1.
Residual correlations between the measured variables were
reported in Table 2.
Discussion
Our model has demonstrated that obesity directed to an
inflammatory process, which could be the precursor of insulin

resistance and dyslipidemia (8,14). Many reports have linked
inflammatory response to the development of insulin resist-
ance (15,16). Also, inflammatory cell infiltration within adi-
pose tissue may be involved in altering adipocyte lipid and
cytokine production, which may in turn have downstream
effects on other metabolically important tissues (17).
In addition, there is a positive direct association between
increased body component and elevated BP. Arterial hyper-
tension in obesity is thought to be related to high circulating
volume (18), reduced bioavailability and lower production of
nitric oxide, increased vascular tone (19), upregulated sympa-
thetic tone (20), and increased expression of angiotensinogen
by adipose tissue (21). The SEM analysis here is not sensitive
to the possibility that insulin resistance and BP are interrelated
through a mechanism other than obesity (9). Development of
hypertension has been linked to chronic low-grade inflam-
mation, but it is not clear whether the connection is direct or
mediated by features of MS (22). In a Dutch study aiming to
investigate the relationship between CRP and MS components,
the association between CRP and BP was weak and not statisti-
cally significant after careful stratification by overweight status
(23). Our model has suggested that the relationship between
high BP and insulin resistance/inflammation could be attrib-
uted to sharable common causes, i.e., obesity.

Epidemiology
The good quality and internal consistency of model fit-
ness suggested the link would represent a potential direction
among these entities. Although the essence of SEM is to verify
a model based upon cross-sectional data, a precise causal rela-
tionship should be relied on further prospective studies. In
addition, the good fit in our model does not rule out other
equally good fit by another model consistent with a different
hypothesis. For example, clear evidence also shows that glu-
cose challenge and increased free fatty acids could increase
inflammatory response (24­26). Although it is confirmatory
that obesity leads to a chronic inflammatory state that inter-
feres with metabolic signal transduction, the reverse could
also apply where aberrant metabolic control and inflamma-
tory consequences accelerate obesity. We did try to modify
our model by switching the sequence between OBE, INF, and
IR. However, the SEM did not obtain a convergence in param-
eter estimation, indicating a lack of confirmation that insulin
resistance precedes inflammation or obesity in the NHANES
data set.
Due to plenty of missing data in the lipid profiles of other
ethnic groups, only the white adults were included for analysis.
However, the authors later applied the same model to the met-
abolic profiles in a group of Taiwanese obese population and
cross-validated the model. Clinical implications are almost the
same between the white and the Taiwanese (27) participants.
The obesity­inflammation link seems relatively unimportant
(standardized regression coefficient is only 0.05) in the general
U.S. population but much bigger in the Taiwanese obese group
(B = 0.69, P < 0.001). This discrepancy may reflect either racial
variation or even a stronger nonlinear association with wors-
ening obesity (27).
One of the limitations of this study was that we did not meas-
ure inflammatory markers other than CRP, nor did we evaluate
biomarkers related to the development of endothelial dysfunc-
tion and impaired fibrinolysis. Other factors associated with
metabolic derangement contributing equal to or more than
obesity, e.g., physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, and socio-
economic status, were not considered and will be analyzed in
future studies.
The results of the cross-sectional analysis in the white par-
ticipants have shown that obesity has a strong influence on
hypertension that obtains little additional influence from
inflammation or insulin resistance. The metabolic profile in
the NHANES group has been confirmatory with the statement
that there is a sequential effect from obesity to inflammation,
insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. This approach has allowed
to inferring important biologic insights about the nature of the
relationships among the components of MS.
