NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY
RESEARCH QUESTION
In this paper, we examine how banks that use internal ratings-based (IRB) approaches as-
sign credit risk in the credit portfolio depending on their market risk exposure in the trading
book.
CONTRIBUTION
Our paper contributes to the growing literature in banking that investigates the link be-
tween risk reporting and bank capital under current internal ratings-based regulation. While
current studies focus solely on how banks report risk in one asset category to economize on
regulatory capital, our paper is the first that takes a comprehensive view on different bank risk
dimensions.
RESULTS
We find that banks report lower credit risk weights for their loan portfolio when they face
higher risk exposure in their trading book. This relationship is especially strong for banks that
have binding regulatory capital constraints. While our results suggest the existence of incen-
tive spillovers across different risk categories, they do not imply an abusive application of
banks' own models to assess risk. Rather, we view our findings to be within the scope of the
allowed discretion of the IRB model framework. These results imply that supervision requires
a comprehensive view on the different bank risk dimension.
NICHTTECHNISCHE ZUSAMMENFASSUNG
FORSCHUNGSFRAGE
In diesem Papier untersuchen wir, ob und wie Banken, die ihre Kreditrisiken auf Basis eines
eignen Modells bestimmen (IRB-Banken), Risiken in ihrem Kreditportfolio in Abhängigkeit
von ihrem Marktrisiko melden.
BEITRAG
Jüngste Studien zeigen, dass Banken im Rahmen der gegenwärtigen Regulierung Kapital ein-
sparen, indem sie systematisch zu geringe Risiken melden. Diese Studien beschränken sich
jedoch auf eine bestimme Anlageklasse. Im Gegensatz dazu nimmt unsere Studie eine ge-
samtheitliche Sicht auf verschiedene Risiken der Banken ein.
ERGEBNISSE
Wir finden, dass Banken geringere regulatorische Kreditrisikogewichte für ihr Kreditportfolio
angeben, wenn sie höherem Marktrisiko im Handelsbuch ausgesetzt sind. Dies gilt verstärkt
für Banken, die näher an ihrer regulatorische Kapitalgrenze operieren. Während unsere Er-
gebnisse für die Existenz von Wechselwirkungen über verschiedene Anlageklassen hinweg
sprechen, implizieren sie keine Manipulation bestehender aufsichtsrechtlicher Regeln. Viel-
mehr gelten aus unserer Sicht diese Ergebnisse innerhalb der von der Aufsicht erlaubten Fle-
xibilität des IRB-Modellrahmens. Diese Ergebnisse zeigen, dass für die laufende Überwa-
chung eine Gesamtheitsbetrachtung der verschiedenen Risikoklassen notwendig ist.
A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW ON RISK REPORTING: EVIDENCE
FROM SUPERVISORY DATA*
PURIYA ABBASSI MICHAEL SCHMIDT
ABSTRACT
We show that banks' risk exposure in one asset category affects how they report regulatory
risk weights for another asset category. Specifically, banks report lower credit risk weights for
their loan portfolio when they face higher risk exposure in their trading book. This relation-
ship is especially strong for banks that have binding regulatory capital constraints. Our results
suggest the existence of incentive spillovers across different risk categories. We relate this
behavior to the discretion inherent in internal ratings-based models which these banks use to
assess risk. These findings imply that supervision should include a comprehensive view of
different bank risk dimensions.

I. INTRODUCTION
Since the mid-1990s, banking regulators globally have allowed banks the discretion to use
their own models to assess risk and thus calculate capital needs. The financial crisis, however,
has triggered a fundamental debate among scholars and regulators about this flexibility given
to banks to scale their regulatory capital (e.g., Haldane, 2013). Many observers distrust the
complicated models that banks use, which they say tend to make assets look safer than they
really are. Therefore, recent initiatives by regulatory bodies are aiming for simpler rules
which are harder to manipulate (BCBS, 2016; Coen, 2016) and closer to what is deemed op-
timal from a benevolent regulator's perspective (Glaeser and Shleifer, 2001). An important
argument against new measures, though, is that simpler rules are less efficient with respect to
capital allocation and thus more stringent. As a result, banks would have to increase their cap-
ital or reduce lending with potential real effects on the economy (Dombrovskis, 2016).1
To
address malfunctions in an efficient manner but prevent over-regulation, it is crucial to under-
stand how and why banks potentially use the discretion inherent in their models.
Recent studies show that banks using the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach econo-
mize on capital by systemically reporting lower risk within a specific asset category, e.g.,
credit risk in the banking book (Mariathasan and Merrouche, 2014; Plosser and Santos, 2014,
Behn, Haselmann, Vig 2016, Firestone and Rezende, 2016, Berg and Koziol, 2017), or market
risk in the trading book (Begley, Purnanandam, and Zheng, 2016). We complement this litera-
ture by assessing different bank risk dimensions comprehensively and ask whether banks re-
port lower risks in one asset category to cross-subsidize risks (and losses) in another asset cat-
egory. The idea being that, if banks can economize on capital by strategic risk-reporting in the
banking book, they could use the `freed capital' to cross-subsidize risk associated with assets
in the trading book and thereby insulate their official capital adequacy ratio. In essence, banks
1 Behn, Haselmann, and Wachtel (2016) and Jiménez, Ongena, Peydró, and Saurina (2017) (among many others) document
how capital regulation affects lending.

would be less capitalized than what official capital ratios suggest and thus create a more frag-
ile banking system. The implications of such a comprehensive risk management would be
threefold: first, banks would use the regulatory discretion to manage short-term adverse mar-
ket risk fluctuations. Second, banks would optimize risk and thus regulatory risk weights at an
aggregate overall risk level as opposed to an asset-specific risk level. Third, supervisors
should include a comprehensive view of the different bank risk dimensions. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study that examines the cross-subsidy incentivized risk reporting
across regulatory asset charges.
To examine this question, we use a unique, proprietary dataset from the Deutsche Bun-
desbank (the German central bank), which collects supervisory information on internal credit
risk ratings for the loan portfolio of all banks in Germany using the IRB approach (hereafter:
IRB banks). In particular, the data comprises IRB banks' estimates of creditors' one-year
probability of default (PD) and the creditor-specific risk-weighted asset at the borrower-bank-
time level for the period between 2008:Q1 and 2012:Q4. The granularity of the internal credit
risk ratings for the loan portfolio of each IRB bank allows us to examine the differential PD
reporting by banks and across borrowers. Notably, we also have access to quarterly superviso-
ry data on market risk-weighted assets for trading book assets (hereafter: mRWA or market
RWA) for each IRB bank during each quarter (BCBS, 2013). This allows us to examine
whether IRB banks report credit risk ratings depending on their market risk exposure. Our ex-
haustive dataset is matched with comprehensive balance sheet information.
The testable hypothesis, which we study in this paper, is that IRB banks report lower cred-
it risk for their loan portfolio when they have higher market risk exposure (as compared to
banks with lower market risk exposure). Our results suggest the existence of incentive spillo-
vers across these two risk categories. On average, an IRB bank with a one-standard deviation
higher market RWA reports lower PDs by 0.03 percentage points, which is equivalent to a re-
2
duction of risk weights by about 3.57 percentage points and thus economically significant.
Conditioning on the level of the regulatory Tier 1 capital ratio, we find that this effect is more
pronounced for banks with more binding capital constraints (lowest 25th percentile of Tier 1
ratio). These results are robust to an exhaustive set of various fixed effects and bank-level
controls.
To tease out the potential channels behind this finding, we examine and discuss three mu-
tually non-exclusive possibilities, all of which relate to the level of discretion inherent in the
models used under the IRB approach. First, we find that our result only holds for banks using
the Advanced-IRB approach but not for banks that employ the Foundation-IRB approach.
These findings suggest that there is self-selection when banks decide which approach (A-IRB
vs. F-IRB) they should choose. That is, especially those banks that tend to exploit the greater
degree of discretion may choose the A-IRB approach over F-IRB.
Second, we find that incentive spillovers across these different risk categories are weaker
when market discipline is higher and stronger for less transparent borrowers with respect to
fundamental information. Third, we find that more stringent regulatory supervision hampers
the use of IRB model discretion for some banks, but not for institutions with stricter capital
constraints. However, the latter finding might also be a result of the fading effect of the finan-
cial crisis. Both interpretations nevertheless suggest a more comprehensive view of risk re-
porting is required in future supervisory practice.
While our results suggest the existence of incentive spillovers across different risk catego-
ries, they do not imply an abusive application of banks' own models to assess risk. Neither do
they indicate that banks manipulate their models after approval has been granted by the na-
tional regulator. Rather, we view our findings to be within the scope of the discretion that the
national regulatory authorities allow to exist in the IRB model framework. This also includes
banks' choice to apply either a point-in-time or a through-the-cycle risk modelling approach.
3
These results contribute to the growing literature in banking that investigates the link be-
tween risk reporting and bank capital under current internal ratings-based regulation (Mari-
athasan and Merrouche, 2014; Plosser and Santos, 2014; Begley, Purnanandam, and Zheng,
2016; Behn, Haselmann, Vig, 2016; Behn, Haselmann, Wachtel, 2016; Firestone and
Rezende, 2016; Berg and Koziol, 2017). While these studies focus solely on how banks report
risk in one asset category to economize on regulatory capital, our paper reveals two new di-
mensions: first, we show that banks use their risk reporting as a device to manage risk across
different asset categories and, second, that banks optimize risk weights at the risk-
comprehensive level rather than at the specific-risk level. In this regard, our paper is also con-
nected to current debates on banking (capital) regulation (e.g., see Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein,
2008; Admati and Hellwig, 2013; Admati, DeMarzo, Hellwig, and Pfleiderer, 2013; Haldane,
2013; Dombrovskis, 2016). Our findings suggest that regulators can curtail the documented
strategic risk reporting by taking a comprehensive view on the different bank risk dimension
in the ongoing supervision.
Our work also adds to the literature on risk-management practice in banking (e.g., see El-
lul and Yerramilli, 2013), which examines the role of strong and independent risk manage-
ment for the resilience of banks' exposure to tail risk. Our findings highlight, that strategic
risk management can have severe consequences for the existence of an institution from a mi-
croprudential perspective. With incentive spillovers across different risk categories, banks re-
duce or even isolate the otherwise adverse effect on their official capital ratio, making the in-
stitution more prone to shocks, both with respect to the asset side (higher risk related to as-
sets) and with respect to the liability side (less capitalized relative to the engaged risk). This is
a form of incentive risk reporting unintended by the regulator. In this respect, our paper also
relates to the literature on regulatory arbitrage (e.g., see Huizinga and Laeven 2012; Acharya,
Schnabl, and Suarez, 2013; Boyson, Fahlenbrach, and Stulz, 2016).
4
At a broader level, our results also relate to the literature that examines the misreporting
incentives in financial markets (e.g., Piskorski, Seru, and Witkin, 2015; and Griffin and
Maturana, 2016) and the related role of incentives and information in the estimation of risk
measures (Rajan, Seru, and Vig, 2010, and 2015). Our results highlight the importance of a
regulatory design that elicits truthful disclosure of risk, which is a prerequisite step to the cur-
rent discussion on the optimal level of regulatory capital banks need to hold. In this regard,
our paper also contributes to the literature that examines the reliability and credibility of risk
weights (e.g., Das and Sy, 2012; Le Leslé and Avramova, 2012, among others). Official capi-
tal adequacy ratios must reflect the actual truthful risks in order for them to be a proper regu-
latory tool for both the microprudential and macroprudential policy.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we will discuss
the institutional details of current IRB-regulation. Section III presents our data set. Section IV
shows our empirical strategy and presents our results. Section V concludes.
II. INSTITUTIONAL SETTING
The current regulatory framework (Basel II and Basel III) relies on the concept of risk-
sensitivity and links capital charges to the risk associated with the assets held. More precisely,
minimum capital charges are determined on the basis of core capital as a fraction of the (un-
weighted) sum of RWA across all sources of risk (total RWAs). On average, around 70% of
bank's assets are allocated to lending and roughly 20% to securities investments (see Table 2).
This means that both, credit risk (i.e., credit RWA) and market risk (i.e., mRWA) account for
the largest part of the variation in bank's total RWA.
The regulator allows banks to use their own internal ratings-based (IRB) models to calcu-
late risk weights (as opposed to standard risk weights, see BCBS, 2006). Under IRB, banks
assess the risk weights in their credit portfolio such that each individual borrower receives a
5
borrower-specific risk weight. The estimation of the borrower-specific risk weight relies on
the bank's own borrower-specific estimated probability of default over the subsequent year.
That is, reported PDs for a given creditor assess the credit risk over a one-year horizon irre-
spective of the loan-specific characteristics such as the actual maturity and the loss given de-
fault. Further, even though internal credit risk models are used on a portfolio basis, borrower-
specific PD estimations are invariant to the bank's credit portfolio insofar that the capital re-
quired for a given loan depends only on the risk of that loan but not on the portfolio it is add-
ed to (BCBS, 2006).
The assessment of risk weights for trading book assets is somewhat different. For internal
market risk weighting, IRB banks use internal Value-at-Risk (VaR) models that are based on
their own assumptions with respect to correlation between all trading assets; that is, in con-
trast to credit risk, for market risk the required capital for a given trading asset depends on the
portfolio it is added to. Also, in calculating value-at-risk, IRB banks typically assume an in-
stantaneous price shock equivalent to a 10-day movement in prices. But in principle, the ra-
tionale remains the same insofar that a bank that uses the IRB approach can apply its own
judgement on (i.e., use models to assess) how risky an investment is and thus on how much
capital needs to be held. That is, under the IRB approach banks' capital charges are endoge-
nous to banks' self-assessment of risk.
The regulator understands that this endogeneity provides banks the discretion to scale
their regulatory capital. But at the same time, the supervisor imposes certain rules to ensure
compliance with the regulatory framework. First, risk models under IRB have to be evaluated
and certified by the respective national supervisor prior to its implementation. Before any
bank is allowed to apply the IRB approach for regulatory purposes, it has to ensure that the
specific model has been used for internal risk management purposes for at least three years,
see (BCBS 2006). After the approval, banks validate their models on a regular frequency (in
6
most cases annually) and adjust them if their assessment is not consonant with realized and
materialized risk (e.g., realized default rates on loans). Second, the regulator conducts a back-
testing approach to evaluate the accuracy of bank's self-assessed risks and imposes a penalty
(e.g., higher capital requirements) on the institutions if their models prove to be inaccurate
and imprecise, see Bundesbank (2004).That is, banks have generally the incentives to use and
hold on to models that have passed the regulator's evaluation and validation check-up.
III. DATA
In Germany, IRB banks undertake the regulatory reporting on their credit portfolio as part
of the quarterly credit register to the Deutsche Bundesbank, which (together with the German
federal financial supervisory authority `BaFin') is the micro and macro-prudential supervisor
of the German banking system. We have access to this supervisory micro data on internal
credit risk measures at the borrower level for each IRB bank in Germany on a quarterly fre-
quency from the beginning of 2008 (which is also the start of the IRB approach to capital reg-
ulation) to the end of 2012.2
For each borrower, the bank reports its estimation on the proba-
bility of default (PD over the subsequent year). In addition, the bank also provides infor-
mation on its borrower-specific credit RWA, which is used to compute the required level of
regulatory capital the bank needs to hold for that specific borrower.3
Note that the PD-
reporting is at the borrower level as opposed to at the loan level.
We also obtain quarterly supervisory data on each bank's internal market risk weights at
the bank-time level. This data captures the market risk-weighted sum of trading book assets
(mRWA) at the bank level during each quarter. We supplement this database on banks' inter-
nal credit risk and market risk weights with confidential supervisory balance sheet statistics at
2 We restrict our baseline regressions to the period of the financial crisis for two main reasons. First, banks' incentives to exploit
the discretion inherent to their models along the lines of our hypothesis should be more pronounced during periods of higher
market risk. And second, it allows for complementary analysis vis-ŕ-vis previous studies that we mentioned in our Introduction.
However, in Section IV.3.3 we extend our sample to 2008-2016 and find similar effects.
3 In our data set, there are 41,697 (out of 703,195) cases, where we have information on the borrower-specific PD but not on
the borrower-specific credit RWA.

the bank level. In particular, we collect quarterly balance sheet items such as bank total assets,
interbank borrowings, savings deposits, and total lending (both retail and wholesale) and su-
pervisory data on bank Tier 1 capital ratio, which are maintained by the Bundesbank.
We complement this rich dataset further with confidential supervisory data at the bank
level, notably on losses and risks associated with trading activities and securities investments,
and also the size of the investment portfolio. More precisely, we compute quarterly statistics
on bank's securities holdings as a fraction of total assets from the security register and collect
confidential supervisory annual information on total profits and net losses from trading from
the profit and loss statements, both of which are maintained by the Deutsche Bundesbank
(e.g., Amann, Baltzer, and Schrape, 2012).
Our complete dataset comprises credit ratings on a total of 269 banks, including both IRB
and non-IRB banks. We prune the data as follows. We first restrict our analysis to IRB banks
only. Also, we exclude the top (and bottom) 5% largest (smallest) values of PD entries (i.e.
PD values larger than 10% and equal to zero, respectively), to ensure that our results are not
driven by outliers. Further, we exclude banks that have less than 50 borrowers with at least
two PD reporting values during our complete sample. Note, however, that our results are
completely robust to both of these sample restrictions. For identification, we further restrict
our sample to those borrowers that have at least two credit relationships with (and thus two
reported PDs from) different banks at the same time. The resulting data set comprises 17,339
distinct borrowers and 38 IRB banks providing more than 45% of credit of the total German
banking system. Together, these banks' total assets account for half of total assets of all banks
in Germany and 160% of annual German GDP as at the year of 2012.
IV. IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY AND RESULTS
In this section, we first discuss our identification strategy to examine banks' internal credit
risk reporting depending on the level of market risk exposure related to trading assets. Sec-
8
ond, we will present our results and, third, we will elaborate on various channels behind our
findings.
IV.1. EMPIRICAL STRATEGY AND IDENTIFICATION
Our testable hypothesis is that IRB banks with higher market risk exposure (as compared
to banks with lower market risk exposure) will assign lower PDs (and thus also lower risk
weights) to the same borrowers at the same time in their credit portfolio in order to cross-
subsidize the risk (or loss) of trading book assets. We examine this using the following econ-
ometric model4
:
i,j,t i,t 1 i,t 1 i,j j,t i,j,t
PD mRWA 'controls
 
          (1)
where PD refers to the probability to default over the next year that bank `i' assigns to bor-
rower 'j' during quarter `t'. `mRWA' measures bank `i's market risk exposure of its trading
book assets (BCBS, 2013). For identification, we include borrower*time fixed effects (
j,t
 )
to account for time-varying, unobserved borrower fundamentals (e.g., risk and growth oppor-
tunities). Note that this identification strategy imposes that each borrower has at least two
credit relationships with different banks at the same time. This identification is crucial for us
to examine the differential PD reporting depending on key bank characteristics. We also in-
clude bank*borrower fixed effects (
i, j
 ) to control for time-invariant, unobserved bank-
borrower-specific characteristics such as geographical distance (Degryse and Ongena, 2005),
relationship lending (Petersen and Rajan, 1995), and reasons related to the regulatory frame-
work (Behn, Haselmann, and Vig, 2016). Note that the inclusion of bank*borrower fixed ef-
fects at the same time controls for all observed and unobserved time-invariant bank-level het-
erogeneity. Thus, we can compare the internal credit risk assigned to the same borrower at the
same time by different banks depending on their market risk exposure. `controls' is a vector
4 Our results do not depend on this specification. In alternative estimations (not reported), we have also used PDs in logarithms.
But our results remain qualitatively unchanged.

of (lagged) time-varying bank variables, notably size, interbank borrowing over total assets,
deposits over total assets, bank and non-bank lending over total assets, securities portfolio
over total assets, ROE, and profits from trading over total income. We include these time-
varying bank variables as our specification does not allow us to include bank*time fixed ef-
fects to control extensively for any observed and unobserved time-varying bank heterogenei-
ty.5
If banks report lower risk for the sake of incentive spillover, the PD adjustment should af-
fect the borrower-specific credit risk weight, and thus overall credit RWA. We test this with
the following econometric model:
credit fitted
i,j,t i,j,t i,j,t i,t-1 i,j j,t i,j,t
RW(PD-implied) (RWA / Loan ) mRWA 'controls
           (2)
where the dependent variable refers to the borrower-specific credit risk weight that bank `i'
assigns to borrower 'j' during quarter `t', as implied by the bank's PD reporting. To measure
the effect of the PD reporting on credit risk weight, we use the fitted values from the follow-
ing auxiliary regression6
:
credit credit
i,j,t i,j,t i,j,t i,j,t
RWA / Loan RW(PD)
   (3)
where the dependent variable is the credit RWA that bank `i' reports for borrower 'j' in quar-
ter `t' (in addition to the individual PD, as explained above) as a fraction of the respective
borrower-specific loan exposure. The fitted values of this regression, i.e.,
credit fitted
i,j,t i,j,t
(RWA / Loan ) , then capture the part of the observed credit risk weight that can be ex-
plained by the reported PD, hence the PD-implied credit risk weight. credit
i,j,t
RW(PD) is computed
5 For instance, we cannot control for the risk-taking behaviour of managers over time across banks; different managers may be
willing to take more risk for reasons such as higher risk tolerance or incentive contracts. One may argue that such managers
may end up being too aggressive in both trading book and lending book causing higher mRWA and lower PD. We do not con-
sider this to be an issue in our analysis for the following reasons. First, it is not straightforward why an `aggressive' manager'
should primarily manifest in higher market risk exposure but not in higher credit risk exposure. Second, risk-taking in the lend-
ing book should be reflective in higher PDs. But as we will discuss below, the marginal effect of an incremental increase in
PDs on risk weights are much less pronounced for higher levels of PDs. Third, it is not clear whether managers' risk-taking
behaviour is systematically correlated with bank's Tier 1 capital position. In fact, persistent risk-taking on the asset side should
rather incentivize managers to operate with higher Tier 1 capital buffers to avoid scrutiny by regulators.
6 We modelled the functional relationship between credit risk weights and PDs in several ways (e.g., using logs, polynomial of n-
th order). Our results do not depend on the specification choice.
10
on the basis of the Basel formula (BCBS, 2005 and 2006) using the reported PD (see Appen-
dix Figure A1). Our coefficient of interest, , in Equation (2) then measures the PD-elasticity
and allows us to infer the economic magnitude and significance of our results from Equation
(1). The explanatory variables and our fixed effects strategy are similar in both Equation (2)
and Equation (1). We estimate our regressions using OLS and cluster standard errors at bank
and borrower level. Our results are also robust to multi-way clustering of standard errors at
bank, borrower and time level (not reported).
IV.2. MAIN RESULTS
We start by taking a first look at the cross-sectional variation in PDs (around the median
PD) for the same borrower at the same time during our sample period. In Figure 1, we can see
that PDs vary substantially and reach levels ranging from ­ 2.5 to +2.5 percentage points
around the median PD. At the face of it, these numbers may seem small. But, for instance,
Moody's ratings of one-year PDs are AAA (for PD=0%), AA (PD=0.01%), A (PD=0.02%),
Baa (PD=0.18%), Ba (PD=1.2%), B (PD=5.23%), and Caa-C (PD=19.47%), see e.g.,
Moody's Analytics (2007). This suggests that the variation in PDs is economically meaning-
ful.7
Yet, the interesting question, which will be at the centre of our analysis, is whether banks
with specific key characteristics are systematically associated with PDs (for the same borrow-
er at the same time) at the lower tail of this PD distribution.
Table 2 presents summary statistics on reported PDs and balance sheet variables of banks
using IRB approaches. We can see that the average creditor PD is 0.72%, which is equivalent
to the Moody's rating bucket `Baa to Ba'. The average credit risk weight for a borrower is
49% and the share of credit RWA accounts, on average, for 88.63% of total bank RWA. This
highlights the role of credit risk for total risk and thus for the level of regulatory capital. The
share of mRWA to total RWA amounts on average to 4.62%. The IRB banks' mRWA
7 Note however that the variation in our PDs cannot be directly translated into changes across rating classes as this categorisa-
tion is non-linear and would require a geometric mapping.
11
amounts to 1.81% of total assets, which is equivalent to 8.79% of total securities (i.e.,
[mRWA/TA]/[Securities/TA], which corresponds to [1.81% ]/[20.57%]). Similar levels are
reported in BCBS (2013). This highlights the role of credit RWA and mRWA for total RWA,
and thus for the level of required capital.
We use Equation (1) as baseline and modify it based on the hypothesis we are testing. In
column 1 of Table 3, we start to examine the differential PD reporting for the same borrower
at the same time at the borrower-bank-quarter level, depending on their level of market RWA
(mRWA) and Tier 1 capital ratio during the previous quarter. There are two findings. First, a
bank with a lower Tier 1 capital ratio reports significantly lower PDs for the same borrower at
the same time as compared to a bank with a higher Tier 1 capital ratio. In this regard, our find-
ing is in line with previous work (Plosser and Santos, 2014; Behn, Haselmann, and Vig, 2016;
Berg and Koziol, 2017). And second, we can see that for the same borrower at the same time,
IRB banks with higher mRWAs report lower PDs as compared to banks with lower mRWAs
in the previous quarter. The magnitude of the different reporting is substantial. An IRB bank
with a one-standard deviation higher market RWA reports lower PDs by 0.03 percentage
points. This translates into a reduction of risk weights by about 3.57 percentage points.8
In
column 2, we add bank*borrower fixed effects and find similar coefficients as in column 1.
Note that in both columns, we include bank*time controls (i.e., bank size, interbank borrow-
ing, deposits, ROE, profits from trading/total income, and overall size of the credit and securi-
ties portfolio), which we absorbed for consolidated representation reasons. In the appendix,
we further show that our main finding on incentive spillover is not a mere result of banks re-
porting higher PDs in response to lower mRWAs, see Table A1. Also, the fact that we do not
find a significant (neither statistically nor economically) effect for periods of decreasing mar-
8 In order to calculate the marginal effect of an increase in PDs we use the Basel formula as stated in BCBS (2006) and assume
an LGD of 45% and a maturity of 2.5 years. The resulting average marginal effect across all borrowers is 127.254. We multi-
ply this average marginal effect by the standard deviation of 0.0214 and the coefficient of 0.0131, which then equals to 3.57
percentage points. These assumptions are rather conservative as they rely on Basel (2006) parameters for senior corporate
debt such that our economic results represent a lower bound.
12
ket risk exposure suggests that our main finding is not a mechanical effect caused by the
choice of the bank's IRB model (i.e., point-in-time vs. through-the-cycle). Moreover, Table
A2 shows that this behaviour is more pronounced during times of higher market risk (i.e.,
when the VIX is particularly high).
Given these two independent set of results, one might be concerned with the question of
how much of these effects are essentially coming from the same channel and how much are
actually independent effects. For example, economically it might be argued that banks which
experience a decline in Tier 1 capital due to losses in their trading book are more likely to re-
port lower PDs for the same borrower at the same time. We examine this by using trading
losses as an instrument for Tier 1 capital in a first-stage regression, and then use the predicted
value of Tier 1 capital from this regression in the second stage with PD as the dependent vari-
able. The results of the second stage regression are presented in column 3. While the predicted
Tier 1 is not significant, neither statistically and nor economically, the coefficient of mRWA
remains both quantitatively and qualitatively unchanged. This suggests that our results pre-
sented in columns 1 and 2 rather point to two independent effects.
In addition to these individual effects, the relationship between the PD reporting and the
market risk of the bank inherent to its trading book assets might depend on the ex-ante level
of its Tier 1 capital ratio. The idea being that banks, for which the regulatory capital limits are
more binding, might report lower PDs in order to cross-subsidize the risk of their trading book
assets as compared to other banks (i.e., less capital constrained banks). To examine this, in
columns 4 and 5 we replicate our analysis of column 2 but condition on IRB banks with the
lowest (bottom 25th percentile of Tier 1 capital ratio) and highest (top 25th percentile of Tier 1
capital ratio) ex-ante regulatory capital ratio, respectively. From column 4, we can see that
IRB banks with more binding regulatory capital limits report lower PDs when they have high-
er ex-ante market risk exposure. Economically, for an IRB bank with a one-standard deviation
13
higher share of mRWA, the bank reports lower PDs to an extent that corresponds to 24.56%
of the total Tier 1 capital ratio.9
We find that the effects are not significant for high-Tier 1-
capital IRB banks (top 25th percentile), compare column 5. In fact, note that the estimated co-
efficient of mRWA in the regressions for low-Tier 1 capital-ratio banks differs by a factor of
more than 7 as compared to the regressions for high-Tier 1 capital-ratio banks (compare e.g.,
column 4 and 5). In Table 4, we replicate the analysis of Table 3 for borrower-specific PD-
implied risk weights to examine the importance of our results. The columns 1 to 5 confirm the
two results from Table 3: banks with higher market risk report lower credit risk weights and
the result is stronger for lower ex-ante capital banks. Economically, an IRB bank with a one-
standard-deviation higher market risk exposure reports lower PD-implied risk weights by 4.91
percentage points when capital constraints are more binding (bottom 25th percentile Tier 1 ra-
tio). These results suggest incentive risk reporting across different risk categories.
IV.3. TEASING OUT THE ECONOMIC CHANNEL
Our robust result on incentive spillovers across different asset categories raises one im-
portant question: what is the economic channel behind it? The answer to this question allows
us to put our findings into perspective and thus draw the proper conclusions. In this section,
we will therefore discuss three different, mutually non-exclusive, possibilities and tease out
their importance.
IV.3.1. FOUNDATION-IRB VS ADVANCED-IRB APPROACH
Under IRB, banks can choose between two approaches to determine capital charges, i.e.,
the `Foundation IRB' (F-IRB, hereafter) and the `Advanced IRB' (A-IRB, hereafter). Under
both approaches, banks use their own PD estimates (BCBS, 2006). But in contrast to F-IRB,
under A-IRB, banks provide also own estimates on other parameters such as the loss given
9 This results from multiplying the standard deviation of mRWA/TA by the coefficient from column 4 of Table 3 times the average
marginal effect (assuming standard Basel values for LGD and maturity) as a fraction of the borrower specific credit risk weight.
More precisely, we first compute the change in RWA-to-Loan ratio, i.e., (0.0625*0.0214*127.254)= 0.17 percentage point.
Then, we determine the relative change in the RWA to-Loan ratio, i.e., (0.0625*0.0214*127.254)/0.4773=0.3565. The credit
RWA accounts for 68.87% of total RWA, which translates to an relative change of total RWA of 35,65%*68.87% = 24,56%
14
default (LGD), the exposure at default (EAD), and the effective maturity. Since banks may
choose between either one of these approaches, there could be a self-selection involved. That
is, especially those banks may choose the A-IRB approach over F-IRB, which intend to ex-
ploit the greater discretion.
We examine this in Table 5 and replicate our estimation from Table 3 (and 4 for credit
risk weights) but restrict ourselves to banks that use the F-IRB and the A-IRB approach, re-
spectively. In column 1, we can see that for banks that use the F-IRB approach the coefficient
on mRWA is not significant. Moreover, the magnitude of the estimated coefficient is substan-
tially smaller. For banks using the A-IRB approach, however, the coefficient of mRWA is
highly significant, both statistically and economically. In fact, the estimated coefficient is
considerably larger in absolute terms. The estimated coefficient suggests that under the A-IRB
approach, a bank with a one-standard deviation higher market RWA reports lower PDs by
0.05 percentage points, which translates into a reduction of risk weights by about 6.84 per-
centage points.
Columns 3 and 4 show similar results for the credit risk weights. This result suggests that
banks are not engaging in outright manipulation of PD estimates. That is to say, if bank's ul-
timate goal was to manipulate their PD estimations, we should also (or especially) find IRB
banks to report lower PDs under F-IRB approach where (i) PDs are the only parameter that
can be estimated, and (ii) PDs could be used to over-compensate the rather conservative esti-
mates of the regulator with respect to the LGD and the maturity. But instead, our results seem
to highlight the role of the greater discretion inherent to the approved models that banks em-
ploy under the A-IRB approach, which banks seem to systematically exploit for incentive
spillovers across different risk categories. Our results therefore suggest that there is a self-
selection in the decision of which approach (A-IRB vs. F-IRB) to choose.
15
IV.3.2. TRANSPARENCY VS MARKET DISCIPLINE
The behaviour of incentive risk reporting can also depend on the borrower type. For in-
stance, one may argue that bank's discretion in assessing the PD is greater for borrowers from
sectors that are less transparent with respect to fundamental information. The notion being
that, PD estimations might be more sensitive to the bank's own assessment when borrower
fundamentals are less traceable. An alternative view could be that the bank's discretion de-
creases when transparency and thus market discipline is high. Large shareholders of listed
firms, for instance, might bring more market discipline on the bank as compared to firms that
are not listed, thus limiting the discretion of a bank vis-ŕ-vis its credit risk assessment for that
firm. We elaborate on these two different economic forces in Table 6. In column 1 and 2 of
Table 6 Panel A, we distinguish between listed and non-listed borrowers. We can see that the
estimation coefficient in both columns is negative and significant. However, we can reject the
null hypothesis of parameter equality suggesting that incentive spillovers are larger for non-
listed borrowers (F-test provided in the lower panel of Table 6). In columns 3 and 4, we repli-
cate the regression from column 2 but condition on borrowers from the MFI sector and from
the non-MFI sector, respectively. If opacity is also a driving force behind our results, we
would expect IRB banks to report especially lower PDs for borrowers from the non-listed
non-MFI sector (i.e., non-banks), which is very probably less transparent with respect to fun-
damental information as compared to borrowers from the not-listed MFI sector (i.e., banks).
We can see that the coefficient on mRWA is negative and significant for borrowers from both
the MFI and non-MFI sector, but statistically (weakly) larger for non-MFI borrowers as com-
pared to MFI creditors (null of parameter equality can be rejected at 10% level of signifi-
cance). In columns 5 to 8, we examine the heterogeneity within the not-listed, non-MFI sector
more narrowly. We do not find significant effects for borrowers from the financial industry,
while effects from the corporate and the real-estate sector are statistically highly significant.
The F-Test presented in the lower part of the table shows that the null of parameter equality
16
can be rejected at the 5% level of significance. In Panel B of Table 6, we show that these re-
sults hold also for the PD-implied risk weight.
Our results on listed vs. not-listed firms highlight the role of market discipline in limiting
the bank's discretion. Yet, we can see that banks do report lower PDs for borrowers from
segments that are less transparent with respect to fundamental information. Together, these
findings indicate that two forces are at play: opacity and market discipline.
IV.3.3. VARIATION IN REGULATORY SUPERVISION
Our results presented above rely on a sample that spans the period of Basel II. In the peri-
od after 2013 though, regulatory supervision has become more stringent as regards superviso-
ry assessments, stress tests, and the introduction of newer regulatory rules including several
key trading book measures. More precisely, the Basel Committee's phase-in period for higher
and better quality capital requirements began from January 2013. Moreover, the Fundamental
Review of the Trading Book, for instance, was meant to replace the crop of measures imple-
mented through Basel 2.5 with a more coherent and consistent set of requirements, and to re-
duce the variability in the capital numbers generated by banks for market risk. By the end of
2013, the European Central Bank conducted the largest-ever supervisory comprehensive as-
sessment including an EU-wide stress test exercise (e.g., Abbassi, Iyer, Peydró, and Soto,
2017). In November 2014, a new single supervisory authority (i.e., the Single supervisory
mechanism, SSM) for the Eurozone was launched with the goal of supervising and monitor-
ing all banks in the euro area more narrowly. One may have the notion that before 2013, regu-
lation was relatively lax as compared to the period thereafter. We examine the impact of the
variation in the regulatory supervision as of 2013 on incentive spillover across different cate-
gories. To that aim, we have collected additional data and expand our sample to also cover the
period from 2013:Q1 through 2016:Q4. In Table 7, we replicate our regression from Table 3
for the full sample running from 2008 until 2016. The aim of this analysis is twofold. First, it
17
will allow us to examine whether our results are robust to the full sample, and second, wheth-
er this behaviour is different depending on the period of more stringent regulatory supervision
as compared to the time before 2013.
In column 1 of Table 7, we can see that the coefficient on mRWA is still significant and
economically meaningful. We find that an IRB bank with a one-standard-deviation higher
market risk exposure reports lower PD-implied risk weights by 0.02 percentage points, which
translates into a reduction of risk weights by about 2.67 percentage points. The estimated co-
efficient suggests that our finding on the incentive spillover across different categories is ro-
bust to the extension of the sample. To examine whether there is a differential effect between
the two periods, i.e., before vs. after 2012, we interact our main variable mRWA/TA (and Tier
1-ratio) with a factor variable that equals the value of one for all quarters from 2013:Q1 until
2016:Q4, and zero otherwise. Interestingly, in column 2 of Table 7 we can see that this rela-
tionship is positive (negative for Tier 1-ratio) and statistically significant during the period af-
ter 2012. The overall effect for the post-2013 period is then the sum of the estimated coeffi-
cient on mRWA/TA and the interaction term, which together is statistically not different from
zero. The respective F-test (not reported) cannot reject the null that (mRWA/TA) ­
(mRWA/TA*Basel III phase in) = 0 at any conventional significance level. This implies that
our finding is particularly present during the period before 2013. Interestingly, we find similar
results also for the Tier 1-ratio. In column 3 and 4, we replicate our analysis but condition on
IRB banks with the lowest (bottom 25th percentile of Tier 1 capital ratio) and highest (top 25th
percentile of Tier 1 capital ratio) ex-ante regulatory capital ratio, respectively. We thus mimic
our analysis from column 4 and 5 of Table 3. However, we find that during the post-2013 pe-
riod our finding is still present for banks with more binding capital constraints. These findings
suggest that the increasing regulatory pressure as of 2013 might have hampered the use of
IRB model discretion for some banks, but not for banks with more binding capital constraints.
18
Yet, an alternative interpretation could be that the weaker result observed during the post-
2013 period relates to the fading effect of the financial crisis, suggesting that incentive spillo-
vers of the kind we document in this paper should be more pronounced during periods of
higher market risk and more binding capital constraints, respectively. Common to both inter-
pretations though is that regulators and supervisors are advised to use a comprehensive view
on risk reporting in future supervisory practice.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we examine whether banks that use the internal ratings-based approach to
capital regulation strategically report lower credit risks for their credit portfolio when they are
more exposed to market risk. We find that IRB banks report lower PDs when they have more
risk exposure in their trading book (as compared to banks with lower market risk). This result
is especially strong for banks that face regulatory capital constraints. We find that this behav-
iour affects risk weights and thus the level of required capital to an economically meaningful
extent. An IRB bank with a one-standard-deviation higher market risk exposure reports lower
credit risk weights by 4.91 percentage points for the same borrower at the same time. Given
that IRB banks are mostly larger banks in Germany, and their total asset size accounts for
160% of German GDP (as at 2012), our results suggest a significant risk to financial stability.
To understand the economic channel behind these results, we relate the observed behav-
iour to the discretion inherent to the models that IRB banks use under the IRB approach. For
instance, we examine whether lower PDs are reported under both the A-IRB and F-IRB. We
find that our result only holds for banks using the Advanced-IRB approach but not for banks
that employ the Foundation-IRB approach, which suggest that there is a self-selection in the
decision of which approach (A-IRB vs. F-IRB) to choose. That is, especially those banks may
choose the A-IRB approach over F-IRB, which intend to exploit the greater discretion. Also,
we find that the systematic incentive spillover is weaker when market discipline is higher and
19
stronger for non-transparent borrowers with respect to fundamental information. Further, we
find that more stringent regulatory supervision hampers the use of IRB model discretion for
some banks, but not for institutions with more binding capital constraints.
Our findings have important policy implications. First, they show that banks use the dis-
cretion inherent to their models to manage adverse fluctuations across different asset catego-
ries. Second, they reveal that banks optimize risk and thus regulatory risk weights at an ag-
gregate overall-risk level as opposed to the asset-specific-risk level. Our results therefore sug-
gest that regulators should continue fostering the comprehensive view on the different bank
risk dimensions in their ongoing supervisory task.

Dependent variable:
The dependent variable is the reported PD by bank `i' for borrower `j' during quarter `t' in the period 2008:Q1 to 2012:Q4. In column 3, the variable `Tier1-ratio' refers to the predicted value of
Tier 1 core capital from a first stage regression, where trading losses are used as an instrument for Tier 1 core capital. In column 4 (5), we restrict our sample to banks that had more (less) binding
capital limits, i.e., banks in bottom (top) 25th percentile Tier 1-ratio, in the previous quarter. `Tier1-ratio' denotes the share of Tier 1 core capital to total RWA for each bank during the previous
quarter `t-1'. All regressions are estimated using ordinary least squares. Lagged, time-varying bank controls (Size, Securities/TA, Credit/TA, Interbank borrowing/TA, Deposits/TA, ROE, Net
losses from trading/total income) and fixed effects are either included (`Y'), not included (`N'), or spanned by another set of fixed effects (`-'). The definition of the main independent variables
can be found in Table 1. Robust standard errors clustered at bank and borrower level are reported in parentheses. ***: Significant at 1% level; **: Significant at 5% level; *: Significant at 10%

Dependent variable:

All banks
The dependent variable is the PD-implied risk weight , i.e., the fitted value of credit risk weight, which is explained by the probability of default that bank `i' assigns to borrower `j' during quarter
't' in the period 2008:Q1 to 2012:Q4. In column 3, the variable `Tier1-ratio' refers to the predicted value of Tier 1 core capital from a first stage regression, where trading losses are used as an in-
strument for Tier 1 core capital. In column 4 (5), we restrict our sample to banks that had more (less) binding capital limits, i.e., banks in bottom (top) 25th percentile Tier 1-ratio, in the previous
quarter. `Tier1-ratio' denotes the share of Tier 1 core capital to total RWA for each bank during the previous quarter `t-1'. All regressions are estimated using ordinary least squares. Lagged, time-
varying bank controls (Size, Securities/TA, Credit/TA, Interbank borrowing/TA, Deposits/TA, ROE, Net losses from trading/total income) and fixed effects are either included (`Y'), not included
(`N'), or spanned by another set of fixed effects (`-'). The definition of the main independent variables can be found in Table 1. Robust standard errors clustered at bank and borrower level are re-

This table replicates column 2 of Table 2 and 3 respectively, but restricts the sample to those banks that use different IRB approaches (Foundation-IRB vs. Advanced-IRB). The dependent varia-
ble in columns 1 and 2 is the reported PD by bank `i' for borrower `j' during quarter `t' in the period 2008:Q1 to 2012:Q4. The dependent variable in columns 3 and 4 is the PD-implied risk
weight, i.e., the fitted value of credit risk weight, which is explained by the probability of default that bank `i' assigns to borrower `j' in quarter 't'. `mRWA/TA' denotes the share of total market
RWA to total assets for each bank during the previous quarter `t-1'. All regressions are estimated using ordinary least squares. Lagged, time-varying bank controls (Size, Securities/TA, Credit/TA,

Subfigure (A) shows the relationship between PDs and the respective regulatory risk weight for loans in the credit portfolio, assuming different values for the loss given de-
fault (LGD) and the loan maturity. The solid black line assumes LGD=45% and maturity of 2.5 years (standard Basel values for corporate loans, see BCBS, 2006), the
dashed black line assumes LGD=75% and maturity of 2.5 years, the dotted grey line assumes LGD=45% and maturity of 5 years, and long-dashed grey line assumes
LGD=75% and maturity of 5 years. Subfigure (B) plots the respective marginal effects, derived from the Basel formula as depicted in Equation (2) (BCBS, 2005).
