Branding Palliative Care Units by Avoiding
the Terms "Palliative" and "Hospice": A
Nationwide Study in Taiwan
Ying-Xiu Dai, MD1,2, Tzeng-Ji Chen, MD1,2, and Ming-Hwai Lin, MD1,2
Abstract
The term "palliative care" has a negative connotation and may act as a barrier to early patient referrals. Rebranding has thus
been proposed as a strategy to reduce the negative perceptions associated with palliative care. For example, using the term
"supportive care" instead of "palliative care" in naming palliative care units has been proposed in several studies. In Taiwan,
terms other than "palliative" and "hospice" are already widely used in the names of palliative care units. With this in mind,
this study investigated the characteristics of palliative care unit names in order to better understand the role of naming in
palliative care. Relevant data were collected from the Taiwan Academy of Hospice Palliative Medicine, the National Health
Insurance Administration of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the open database maintained by the government of
Taiwan. We found a clear phenomenon of avoiding use of the terms "palliative" and "hospice" in the naming of palliative
care units, a phenomenon that reflects the stigma attached to the terms "palliative" and "hospice" in Taiwan. At the time of
the study (September, 2016), there were 55 palliative care units in Taiwan. Only 20.0% (n = 11) of the palliative care unit
names included the term "palliative," while 25.2% (n = 14) included the term "hospice." Religiously affiliated hospitals were
less likely to use the terms "palliative" and "hospice" (2 = 11.461, P = .001). There was also a lower prevalence of use of
the terms "palliative" and "hospice" for naming palliative care units in private hospitals than in public hospitals (2 = 4.61, P =
.032). This finding highlights the strong stigma attached to the terms "palliative" and "hospice" in Taiwan. It is hypothesized
that sociocultural and religious factors may partially account for this phenomenon.

Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines "palliative
care" as an approach that improves the quality of life of
patients and their families facing the problems associated
with life-threatening illness through the prevention and relief
of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable
assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, includ-
ing physical, psychosocial, and spiritual problems.1 Most
cancer patients, for example, experience multiple forms of
physical and psychological distress at all stages of their ill-
ness, with cancer-related symptoms significantly impacting
their daily activity and quality of life.2 According to the
WHO, palliative care is applicable early in the course of
illness, in conjunction with other therapies that are intended
to prolong life, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy,
and includes those investigations needed to better understand
and manage distressing clinical complications.1 Multiple
studies have shown that integrating palliative care early in
the disease trajectory improves symptom control, quality of
life, patient and caregiver satisfaction, end-of-life care, costs
of care, and, potentially, survival.3-7 Despite the increased
use of palliative care, however, most patients only receive
the service late in the disease trajectory or not at all.8-11 Prior
research has suggested that the term "palliative care" itself
might be a deterrent to early referrals and that the term "sup-
portive care" may be more favorable for some hospital-based
palliative care programs.12-14 The term "palliative care" car-
ries a stigma for physicians, patients, and their caregivers,
who regard it as synonymous with death and dying, loss of
control, hopelessness, and abandonment. "Supportive care,"
in contrast, has been regarded as a more favorable term.15,16
According to previous studies, the term "supportive care" is

In Taiwan, palliative care services include inpatient care,
home care, and outpatient services. The National Health
Insurance (NHI) program reimburses the cost to service pro-
viders of home care, outpatient services, inpatient care, and
shared care, a service for patients in nonhospice wards. The
NHI program was established in 1995 to provide health care
to all residents in Taiwan. Currently, 99.9% of Taiwan's pop-
ulation is covered by the NHI program. It is a government-
administered insurance-based national health care system.
As of September 2016, there were 55 palliative care units,
141 inpatient consultation teams, 93 home care teams, and
155 community service teams in Taiwan.20 In Taiwan, pallia-
tive care is defined as specialized medical care that focuses
on providing patients relief from pain and other distressing
symptoms of a serious illness, regardless of the diagnosis or
stage of disease. The palliative care units defined in this
study are palliative care wards in hospitals. Actually, all the
palliative care units in Taiwan are hospital-based inpatient
units. Hospice care is difference from palliative care. Hospice
care focuses on supportive care to people in the final phase of
a terminal illness. In Taiwan, there are no residential facili-
ties to provide hospice care. Hospice care is provided in the
settings of hospital-based inpatient care, outpatient services,
and home care. Although inpatient palliative care services in
Taiwan have increased from 1 ward in 1990 to 55 palliative
care units with more than 756 beds in 2016, the term "pallia-
tive care" itself is not commonly used in palliative care units.
This study is the first to examine the naming patterns of pal-
liative care units from a nationwide prospective. In this
study, nationwide data on palliative care units in Taiwan
were collected and analyzed to examine (1) the naming pat-
tern used in the naming of palliative care units; (2) the asso-
ciations, if any, between the names of palliative care units,
the numbers of beds, the levels of medical facilities, and the
population sizes and degrees of urbanization in the areas
served by different units; and (3) the common themes for
naming palliative care units.
Material and Methods
Data Collection
The nationwide data were collected from the Taiwan
Academy of Hospice Palliative Medicine, the National
Health Insurance Administration of the Ministry of Health
and Welfare, and the open database maintained by the gov-
ernment of Taiwan (http://data.gov.tw/). The services pro-
vided by the palliative care units in Taiwan are covered by
the National Health Insurance. Therefore, the database from
the National Health InsuranceAdministration of the Ministry
of Health and Welfare included all the information of pallia-
tive care units in Taiwan. These data included the names of
palliative care units, and the variables analyzed included the
level of medical facilities, the number of beds in each pallia-
tive care unit, and the degree of urbanization and the popula-
tionoftheareaservedbyeachunit.Thedegreeofurbanization
was defined using the categorizing methods of Liu et al,
which divide the degree of urbanization into 7 types, namely,
highly urbanized towns, medium urbanized towns, emerging
towns, general towns and cities, aging towns, agricultural
towns, and remote towns.21
Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed using the statistical software SPSS
version 22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York). The samples
were separated into 3 groups (with 2 groups made up of unit
names that included either "hospice" or "palliative," and a
third group made up of unit names that included neither of
those 2 terms). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize
the names of the palliative care units, the level of medical
facilities, the number of beds in each palliative care unit, and
the degree of urbanization and the population of the area
served by each unit. An analysis of variance F test was con-
ducted to compare the number of beds in each unit and the
population served by each unit for the 3 aforementioned
groups. A chi-square test of independence was performed to
compare the level of medical facilities for the 3 groups. A
Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate only the highly
urbanized towns and medium urbanized towns against the
type of name, because of the small numbers of palliative care
units in emerging towns, general towns and cities, aging
towns, agricultural towns, remote towns, and outlying
islands. A P value < .05 (2-tailed) was considered statisti-
cally significant.
Qualitative Analysis
The first part of the analysis consisted of enumerating the
words used in the different units' names. Second, using the
approach of thematic analysis, the words were grouped in
terms of their denotative and connotative meanings to cap-
ture the key themes. Denotative meanings are what a word
literally refers to, and connotative meanings are the associa-
tions, values, and judgments that surround this.22 The fre-
quencies of occurrence for each category were calculated to
derive the dominant concepts. This study was approved by
the institutional review board of Taipei Veterans General
Hospital according to Republic of China law.
Results
Characteristics of Study Samples
At the time of the study (September, 2016), there were 55
palliative care units in Taiwan. Among the hospitals having
palliative care units, 38.2% (n = 21) were public and 61.8%
(n = 34) were private. Religiously affiliated hospitals
Dai et al 3
accounted for 27.3% (n = 15) of all the hospitals, including 4
Buddhist hospitals, 5 Catholic hospitals, and 6 Christian hos-
pitals. The basic characteristics of the palliative care units are
summarized in Table 1. Only 20.0% (n = 11) of the palliative
care unit names included the term "palliative," while 25.2%
(n = 14) included the term "hospice." One palliative care unit
used both "palliative" and "hospice" in its name. It is noted
that although the term "hospice" is used, the units with "hos-
pice" in their names are actually palliative care wards.
Finally, neither "palliative" nor "hospice" was used in more
than half of the palliative care unit names (56.4%, n = 31).
Bivariate Correlations
Table 1 shows the bivariate analyses of the level of medical
facilities, the number of beds in each palliative care unit, the
degree of urbanization, and the population size, along with
possible associates. A tendency toward avoiding the terms
"palliative" and "hospice" was found in religiously affiliated
hospitals (2 = 11.461, P = .001). There was also a lower
prevalence of use of the terms "palliative" and "hospice" for
naming palliative care units in private hospitals than in pub-
lic hospitals (2 = 4.61, P = .032). In terms of the levels of
medical facilities, the numbers of beds in the palliative care
units, the population sizes, and the urbanization levels, there
was no statistically significant association with use of the
term "palliative" or "hospice" in palliative care unit names.
Qualitative Analysis of Clinic Names
Among the palliative care units that did not use "palliative" or
"hospice" in their names, 22.6% (n = 7) used people's names
in their names, for example, "Saint Francis home."Apart from
people's names, Table 2 lists the frequency with which certain
words occurred in those unit names not including the terms
"palliative" or "hospice." The most frequently occurring word
was  (xin), which means "mind" or "heart" in Chinese. The
second most frequently occurring words were  (ai), mean-
ing "love," and (lian), meaning "lotus." The third most fre-
quently occurring words were  (sheng), meaning "saint"; 
(en), meaning "grace";  (ning), meaning "peace"; and 
(de), meaning "virtue." Three themes were identified from the

words used in the palliative care unit names, as shown in
Table 3. The first theme, which we have called kindness and
love, accounted for 6 occurrences. The second theme was
described as religion and accounted for 5 occurrences. The
third theme was peace and accounted for 4 occurrences.
Discussion
This study is the first systematic analysis of nationwide data
regarding the naming of palliative care units. In this study, we
found that the terms "palliative" and "hospice" tend to be
avoided in naming palliative care units. Instead, words reflect-
ing the themes of "kindness and love," "peace," and "religion"
were frequently used. This finding suggests the hypothesis
that less stigmatizing names were used to generate more posi-
tive impressions, higher perceived need, and more referrals.
The stigma attached to palliative care is known to be asso-
ciated with death, hopelessness, dependency, and end-of-life
care.12-14 Erving Goffman, a sociologist, defined stigma in
terms of undesirable and deeply discrediting attributes that
disqualify one from full social acceptance and motivate
efforts by the stigmatized individual to hide the mark when
possible.23 Link and Phelan proposed that stigma exists when
elements of labeling, stereotyping, separating, status loss, and
discrimination co-occur in a power situation that allows these
processes to unfold.24 Previous studies suggested that the
term "palliative care" evoked more negative perceptions in
physicians, patients, and their caregivers, compared with the
term "supportive care." It is associated with death, hopeless-
ness, dependency, and end-of-life care for inpatients.13,14
Prior research suggests that stereotypical images of palliative
care among patients and their caregivers were derived in large
part from their interactions with the medical system, with
patients stating that their health care providers delayed refer-
ral to palliative care and equated it with end-of-life care.14,15
Many oncologists delay referral to palliative care until all
disease-modifying treatments have been exhausted.8-11
Oncologists are gatekeepers of palliative care referral and,
therefore, are of paramount importance in improving the inte-
gration of palliative care services. The decision to refer to pal-
liative care is a highly complex process, and assessing the
timing of referral is not straightforward.25,26 It depends on
national and regional health care policies, local resources, the
comprehensiveness of the palliative care teams, patient char-
acteristics, and the level of palliative care provided by pri-
mary care teams.27 There are various factors that can impede
the referral process. Negative attitudes toward palliative care
are one of the most frequently cited barriers to palliative care
access.28 In this study, the finding of avoiding use of the terms
"palliative" and "hospice" in the naming of palliative care
units reflected the negative attitudes toward palliative care
and hospice. Rebranding palliative care has been proposed as
a strategy to reduce the negative perceptions associated with
palliative care.16-19 The finding of this study suggests the
hypothesis that words other than "palliative" or "hospice" are
used might be to reduce the negative perceptions of palliative
care and enhance patients' acceptance of admission to these
units or of oncologists' referral of patients to these units. This
finding also suggests several possible directions for future
research, such as research into the degree of patients' under-
standing of the informed consent process when they are being
admitted to palliative care units. In this study, avoiding use of
the terms "palliative" and "hospice" reflects the stigma asso-
ciated with palliative care, which relates to a larger societal
attitude toward death.29 In a cross-cultural study, 70% of the

Taiwanese physicians reported that they often or very often
experienced families as being reluctant to discuss end-of-life
issues, while the corresponding figures were 50% in Japan
and 59% in Korea.30 Reluctance to participate in end-of-life
discussions is common all over the world, especially in Asia.
The most hypothesized interpretation is that Confucianism
does not systemically refer to life after death, and death has
been a taboo for long periods.31 The beliefs about Taoism,
Confucianism, and Buddhism have influenced Chinese peo-
ple for thousands of years, particularly in relation to death and
dying.32 In Taiwan, 35% of the population is composed of
Buddhists, 33% of Taoists, 3.9% of Christians, and 18.7% of
people who identify as not religious.33 In this study, 14 of the
15 religiously affiliated hospitals did not use "palliative" or
"hospice" in the name of their palliative care units. Prior
research showed that culture and religious beliefs affect one's
perception of palliative care and the decision making that
occurs at end of life.34-36 However, future research is needed
to further understand the role of religious beliefs in attitudes
toward palliative care in Taiwan.
This study has several limitations. First, while we found
the phenomenon of avoiding use of the terms "palliative"
and "hospice" in the naming of palliative care units, the
determinants of choosing names for palliative care units are
still unclear. The choice of names may rest with stakeholders
other than oncologists and palliative care providers (eg, key
administrators, funders). Second, this study only shows that
the terms "palliative" and "hospice" are avoided in the names
of palliative care units, but it is not able to directly reflect the
perceptions of patients and palliative care providers. Third,
the study was conducted in Taiwan. The findings in this
study thus may not generalize to other countries with differ-
ent cultures and languages. Finally, the effects of palliative
care unit naming on perceived stigma and perceived service
need among patients were not clarified due to a lack of
related data. Further study is thus needed to further evaluate
the effects of palliative care unit names on attitudes toward
palliative care among both physicians and patients.
Conclusion
The findings of this study offer novel insights into our under-
standing of the stigmatization and elements of labeling
associated with palliative care. There is a strong stigma
attached to the terms "palliative" and "hospice" in Taiwan.
The tendency toward avoiding use of the terms "palliative"
and "hospice" in the names of palliative care units is espe-
cially significant among private hospitals and religiously
affiliated hospitals. Sociocultural and religious factors are
hypothesized to partially account for this phenomenon.
