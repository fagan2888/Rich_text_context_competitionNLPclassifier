Providing ethical guidance
for collaborative research in
developing countries
Nina Morris
University of Edinburgh, UK
Abstract
Experience has shown that the application of ethical guidelines developed for research in
developed countries to research in developing countries can be, and often is, impractical
and raises a number of contentious issues. Various attempts have been made to provide
guidelines more appropriate to the developing world context; however, to date these efforts
have been dominated by the fields of bioscience, medical research and nutrition. There is
very little advice available for those seeking to undertake collaborative social science or
natural science research in developing countries and what is there tends to be held within
disparate sources. Charting the development of a set of ethics documentation for future use
by the Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme research community,
this paper outlines past and present attitudes towards ethics procedures amongst this
community and suggests ways in which ethics procedures might be made more relevant and
user-friendly to researchers working in this area.

Ethics is one of the `buzzwords' of the 21st century and in the last decade, amid
growing concern over economic inequalities and international human rights,
increasing public interest in scientific endeavours (Molyneux and Geissler, 2008)
and broader social trends towards individual and organizational `accountability'

(Boden et al., 2009; McCormack et al., 2012), ethical issues have attained greater
significance than ever before (Schroeder and Pisupati, 2010). Ethical review by
Research Ethics Committee (REC) is now a standard part of the grant application/
award process for social science and natural science research in UK universities
(Jaspers et al., 2013) ­ particularly since the publication of the Economic and
Social Research Council (ESRC) Framework for Research Ethics and the Natural
Environment Research Council (NERC) Ethics Policy in 2005 (Boden et al., 2009;
Hammersley, 2009; Burr and Reynolds, 2010; McCormack et al., 2012) ­ and
most institutions and organizations who support pure and/or applied research will
now have a college, if not school, level REC (Ekberg, 2012).
There are a number of reasons why it is desirable for researchers to adhere to
ethical norms. As Resnik (2011) synthesizes, it helps to promote the aims of
research (knowledge, truth, avoidance of error) and the values that are essential to
collaborative work (trust, accountability, mutual respect, fairness), it ensures pub-
lic accountability (particularly important when researchers are funded by public
money), it can help build public support for research (trust in quality and integ-
rity), and assist in promoting other important moral and social values (social
responsibility, human rights, etc.). Where the research involves international col-
laboration between researchers from developed and developing countries it can
remind those working in privileged positions and in wealthier countries of the
need to reflect not only on their own framework of thinking, but also on the impli-
cations of the very different mind-sets and environments in which their research
projects will be carried out (Benatar, 2002; Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2002).
It can also draw attention to the risk of exploitation that might result from inequali-
ties (e.g. financial, access to resources) between the project collaborators (European
Union, 2010). There is also a strong case for REC regulation. Responsible for
reviewing research proposals before data collection commences to evaluate the
risks faced by the researcher and researched, RECs play a key role in "the wider
quality assurance and quality enhancement processes that operate within all insti-
tutions that conduct research" and, in turn, help to protect the integrity and reputa-
tion of science as a `virtuous profession' (Ekberg, 2012: 335).
Whilst researchers largely accept the rationale for ethical oversight (Klitzman,
2011; Nind et al., 2012) there is, however, rising concern regarding the perceived
bureaucratization of ethics through REC regulation (Hammersley, 2009, 2014)
and the applicability of the prevailing biomedically-derived model of research eth-
ics governance (Hoeyer et al., 2005; Rice, 2008; Dingwall, 2008; Librett and
Perrone, 2010; Blee and Currier, 2011; Schrag, 2011), particularly when the
research involves qualitative or ethnographic methods (Burr and Reynolds, 2010;
Bond, 2012; Morrell et al., 2012; Monaghan et al., 2013; Emmerich, 2013). These
`fault lines' are especially apparent in international collaborative research involv-
ing developed and developing countries (London, 2002). Although there are some
Morris 213
transferable elements (e.g. security considerations) it is frequently impractical to
apply ethical frameworks created for research in developed countries to develop-
ing world contexts (Creed-Kanashiro et al., 2005; Choudhury, 2007; Sultana,
2007; Cannella and Lincoln, 2011; Araali, 2011; Mollet, 2011; Ravinetto et al.,
2011) and there is a real danger that researchers end up reproducing "the colonial
established authority of Western epistemologies" (Chilisa, 2005: 675) whilst
`silencing' indigenous ethics (Tikly and Bond, 2013; Louw and Delport, 2006).
For example, the conventional principle of informed consent assumes that
"research participants are individuated subjects who are more-or-less autonomous
of social ties and obligations, literate, adult, and accustomed to relating to others
in the context of formal contractual agreements" (Butz, 2008: 242; Hoeyer et al.,
2005; Burr and Reynolds, 2010), making it ill-suited to addressing community-
level concerns (Guta et al., 2012; Klitzman, 2012). In Chattopadhyay and De
Vries's (2008: 108) opinion, even when `tweaked' to relocate autonomy in the
family, clan, or with an elder, the concept of the researched as an autonomous
being "is an assault on the tradition and values of non-Western societies who
believe in the matrix of relationships in dynamic equilibrium of the cosmos". What
is more, any efforts to make bioethics more `culturally appropriate' have to date
amounted to little more than `adapting' western bioethics to `varied cultural set-
tings' (Chattopadhyay and De Vries, 2008).
The identification of procedures which both meet the ethical demands of the
research sponsor(s) and are appropriate to the context within which the research
is to be carried out is an all too familiar problem for those involved in interna-
tional collaborative research between developed and developing countries
(Sultana, 2007; Ajuwon and Adegbite, 2008; Rowson, 2010). This problem is
amplified if (and as is usually the case) the presiding REC is unfamiliar with the
social, political and cultural circumstances of the host country (Mollet, 2011;
Smith, 2012) or if it lacks the resources to undertake independent assessment of
the risks associated with the research under review (European Union, 2010).
Although this is an area which has received significant attention in recent years
(Velho and Velho, 1996; SCRPDC, 1998; Tan-Torres Edejer, 1999; Caballero,
2002; Creed-Kanashiro et al., 2005; Choudhury, 2007; Sugarman et al., 2007;
McIntosh et al., 2008), there is still very little advice available for those seeking
to undertake collaborative social or natural science research in developing coun-
tries. As Molony and Hammett (2007) attest, searching academic databases for
guidance on the ethics of employing local research assistants, and advice on the
additional difficulties frequently experienced when researching in the develop-
ing world, is a frustrating experience. The natural scientist searching for guid-
ance on sampling rare or endangered taxa/species and then transporting these
samples out of the host country would find a similar dearth of material. Guidance
from sponsor organizations is also scant and researchers wishing to undertake
214 Research Ethics 11(4)
research in these areas are forced to obtain advice from a number of disparate
sources (e.g. professional Codes of Conduct in related disciplines, national and
international legislation, international treaties, etc.). To compound this, although
certainly growing in numbers (Klitzman, 2012), properly functioning RECs sim-
ply do not exist in many developing countries and where they do they tend to be
ineffective, under-resourced and unevenly distributed (Nuffield Council on
Bioethics, 2002; Choudhury, 2007; Hyder et al., 2004).
In 2012, recognizing these problems, the Ecosystem Services for Poverty
Alleviation (ESPA)1 Directorate (see ESPA, 2014) commissioned the author to
produce an ethics form and accompanying guidance notes for future use by the
ESPA research community. The ethics documents had to be accessible, relevant to
both natural and social scientists, and cover all pertinent issues including health
and safety. To date, the named Principal Investigators (PIs) on the grants awarded
by the ESPA research programme have, with only a few exceptions, been based in
UK institutions (although this does not necessarily mean that the UK is their coun-
try of origin). The work funded by ESPA has, however, involved collaborations
between academic colleagues in a diverse range of disciplines, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), government institutions, and other stakeholders in coun-
tries across Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America.
The aim was not to provide an iron-clad formula for `ethical' research; rather, it
was hoped that the new ethics procedure would foster discussion, offer a frame-
work for making decisions for both social and natural science researchers, encour-
age PIs and their Co-Investigators (Co-Is) to design culturally sensitive and
appropriate studies, make intelligent choices before, during and after their time in
the field and, as a result of undertaking ethically aware research, develop relevant
capacities in the host countries (Sultana, 2007). As such, ESPA understood that
research ethics involves far more than just anonymity or confidentiality, issues
that can sometimes consume the `protectionist discourses' of RECs (Nind et al.,
2012); rather, they wanted their ethics guidance to be "embedded in the totality of
scholarly practice" (Baarts, 2009: 424).
This paper focuses on the findings of the research which later went on to
inform the development of this ethics guidance. It begins with a brief outline of
the research strategy and the work done to engage members of the ESPA research
community in the design process. I then outline the extent to which the members
of this community had (or had not) engaged with ethics procedures in the past
(be this in their own institution, a collaborating institution, overseen by the fund-
ing body, relevant professional panel, or in-country department/panel) and their
attitudes towards ethics review procedures focusing, in particular, on their
responses to questions regarding the communication of ethical protocols, host-
country review, monitoring and evaluation, IPR and authorship, and collabora-
tive relationships. In so doing, the paper highlights points of consensus but also
Morris 215
areas of contention which must be taken into consideration in the design of eth-
ics documentation.
The design process
The design process incorporated four key phases. Phase One comprised a desk-
based literature and Code of Practice review to highlight pertinent issues and col-
late examples of best practice from research in a range of disciplines relevant to
the work funded by ESPA (e.g. African studies, agriculture, anthropology, biology,
business, civil engineering, conservation, development studies, economics, educa-
tion, energy studies, environmental science, forestry, health studies, geography,
life sciences, meteorology, psychology, social policy, urban studies, zoology). The
search period was 1990­2011 and the key search terms were: ethic*, develop*,
guid*, code, practice, conduct, protocol, committee, collab*, consent, confidenti-
ality, intellectual property rights (IPR), international, data, sampl*, indigenous,
specimen, environment, field site, non-governmental organization (NGO), field/
research assistant, permit, treaty, trans*, dissemination, benefit, capacity, health,
safety, travel. The databases searched included Academic Search Elite, Article
First, ASSIA, Google Scholar, IngentaConnect, Web of Knowledge, and Scopus.
A snowballing technique was then implemented using the reference lists of the
papers identified during the search; recommendations made by the questionnaire
respondents and interviewees were also followed up. Draft documents were then
created (using the University of Edinburgh School of GeoSciences ethics proce-
dure as a template as requested by NERC) and published on the ESPA website for
comment (these included an ethics form, Self-Assessment Guidance Notes, and
Full Assessment Guidance Notes for those undertaking research on vulnerable
human subjects or sensitive topics, using invasive procedures, and certain types of
biophysical research, e.g. sampling rare/endangered or harmful taxa/species).
Phase Two involved the distribution of a Project Information Sheet and ques-
tionnaire to all past and present ESPA grant holders and, to broaden out the
response, all recipients of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) ­
Department for International Development (DFID) Joint Scheme for Research on
International Development (Poverty Alleviation) Phase 1 and Phase 2 awards (for
the advantages of this approach see Sax et al., 2003; Kaplowitz et al., 2004;
Denscombe, 2009) (n=146). For data protection reasons ESPA requested that the
questionnaire be emailed to the ESPA grant recipients via the ESPAAdministrator;
I emailed the questionnaire directly to the ESRC-DFID grant recipients. Similarly,
ESPA were also unable to provide contact details for the Co-Investigators (Co-Is)
on their projects and the ESRC-DIFD award website only stated the PI's institu-
tional affiliation. As a result it was agreed that all the PIs would be asked to for-
ward a copy of the questionnaire to their respective Co-Is; the responses show that
216 Research Ethics 11(4)
some did comply with this request, but it is impossible to determine how many
Co-Is actually received the survey. All the questionnaire recipients were requested
to return their completed survey to me personally and were assured that ESPA
would not see the raw data. Split into two sections, the anonymized questionnaire
included a mix of Likert Scale, straight yes/no and open-ended questions; Part 1
canvassed the recipients' views on the need for, and value of, research ethics and
asked questions relating to the `doing' of collaborative research with particular
reference to their ESPA or ESRC-DIFD award, and Part 2 solicited their feedback
on the draft documents. The quantitative survey data was analysed using Microsoft
Excel 2010; a database was created and the data was coded and analysed to obtain
response ratios. The qualitative survey data was analysed and coded thematically.
It is important to note that not all the respondents answered all the questions that
were relevant to their project.
In Phase Three, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with self-
selecting questionnaire respondents in order to gain a deeper insight into their
views on research ethics and current procedures, to follow up specific responses,
and to discuss how the draft form and guidance notes might be modified to increase
their relevancy and make them more user-friendly. At the participants' request all
but two of the interviews were conducted via Skype, the exceptions being con-
ducted in person at the individual's place of work. All the interviewees gave their
permission for the interviews to be audio-recorded and the anonymized interview
files were transcribed in full by an independent transcription service. Each inter-
viewee was assigned a pseudonym (e.g. Interviewee 2) and informed that every
effort would be made to delete project identifiers (e.g. country, region, specific
subject matter, project partners); however, participants were also made aware that,
due to the unique nature of some projects, they might be identifiable to those who
were intimately connected to, or knowledgeable about, their work. Each individ-
ual was given the opportunity to view their transcript and to make amendments.
All the interviewees provided written or verbal consent; two requested to see the
report before its submission to ESPA. The interview material was analysed and
coded thematically.
The final stage of the project, Phase 4, involved the production of a revised set
of ethics documentation incorporating feedback from Phases Two and Three.
Attitudes towards ethical review
Only 23 completed questionnaires were returned by the deadline despite email
reminders (Table 1); a further two questionnaires were returned after the quantita-
tive analysis had been completed. The quantitative data from these responses has
not been included here, but the qualitative material has been used where applicable.
Eight of the emails sent to the ESRC-DFID PIs were returned as `undeliverable',
Morris 217
five elicited an `out of office' response, and one ESPA PI noted that their project
had not yet started. Nine interviews were conducted, including one PI who did not
complete the questionnaire but agreed to be interviewed, and one with an expert in
the field of development research ethics recommended by an interviewee.
Twelve respondents confirmed that they had been involved in a research project
in a developing country in the last eight years (the time elapsed since the ESRC
and NERC launched their respective research ethics protocols) which had not been
ethically reviewed by any REC or professional body (Table 2a). The reasons for
this were diverse, with interviewees citing the lack of a perceived need due to the
nature of their research (e.g. data processing, no human subjects), lack of demand
from the funding body, and the absence of an institutional REC (a particular prob-
lem for those based in developing countries, although not exclusively). Several
interviewees who self-identified as natural science researchers and/or who used
data modelling or secondary data said they associated research ethics primarily
with work involving human subjects or animals. As Interviewee 4 commented:
most of our projects are environmental projects. So we're trying to improve [environmental]
quality or [resource] availability, you know, the general eco-system. [...] we're not using
humans as test subjects, we're not using animals. So it's always been something that we're used
to preparing for any proposal, but it's always just kind of like the last paragraph you prepare
because usually there's no major ethics considerations, and that maybe because I'm a scientist
and I may not be understanding what ethics are. But as far as I'm concerned it's, you know,
there's usually not very many ... we're not doing medical science, so there's no ethics. There's
a lower ethics [...] let's say.
When these interviewees considered research ethics it was a reactive rather than
proactive process, often at the specific request of the funding body or the home
institution and done at the last minute with little in-depth consideration of the

relevant issues or `dilemmas'. These interviewees also expressed ambivalence
towards the procedural aspects of ethics review, which they saw as an inconven-
ience in the life-course of a research project, and several noted that they `dreaded'
the bureaucracy of securing ethics approval (Pickersgill, 2012). In order to `pass'
they went through the motions of ticking what they presumed to be the `right
boxes' or `saying the right thing' rather than thinking through the relevant ethical
principles and making substantive ethical judgements about their work and prac-
tice (Dyer and Demeritt, 2008; Mollet, 2011).
All the questionnaire respondents said they felt that it was important to consider
research ethics (however, it is necessary to conclude, given the quote above, that
this may be brief in some cases) and the majority were confident that they knew
where to find information relating to, and were knowledgeable about, ethics in their
subject area (Table 2b). Seven said they had, in the past, been involved in research

in a developing country which had caused them ethical concern (Table 2a). The
most common causes for concern being the research participants' exposure to risk
(e.g. through the absence of adequate compensation mechanisms, ineffective com-
munication, inadequate risk/benefit assessment, ineffective project management,
the absence of formal contractual agreements for local field assistants, lack of or
ineffective project monitoring and evaluation, and lack of informed consent), and
the inequitable distribution of IPR (including instances of academic imperialism,
ineffective dissemination, and failure to ensure fair distribution of potential bene-
fits). Describing their involvement in a previous project, Interviewee 1 stated:
[The specialist researchers] said they would provide [additional assistance for the control
group]. Now because this is in a remote place people don't have the same understanding[s] [...]
[and] although the [specialist had] explained it to their satisfaction it made absolutely no sense
[to the research participants] and it was followed ... it was not properly followed up because the
[specialists] left [a] local community [...] worker to do the following up and he was based at a
considerable distance and wasn't given any particular incentive to carry this out and as a result
one [group experienced huge losses] and was very puzzled and distressed and couldn't
understand what had gone wrong.
This interviewee felt that the project leaders in this situation had `violated' both
the principle of prior informed consent and the ethics of practice but recalled
feeling powerless to do anything about it given there was no recourse provided
by a pre-approved ethics document. It is worth noting, however, that only five
respondents said they had chosen not to participate in a project because a desir-
able standard could not be met and there was no evidence to show that any col-
laborative agreements had broken down because of disagreements relating to
ethics (Pickersgill, 2012).
Sixteen questionnaire respondents confirmed that their ESPA or ESRC-DFID
project(s) had been ethically reviewed (either by the PI's institutional REC and/or
professional body in the PI's country of residence) (Table 3), although one inter-
viewee appeared to have misunderstood the function of the JES system, assuming
that ethical review was part of the post-submission vetting process:
we write a proposal with, on what is the Joint [Electronic] Submission system [...] so we fill
everything in then, [...] it goes to the university administration and then [...] I know it goes
through various checks and whatever and so it might be that one of the checks is not for review
committee but to be honest, well, yeah, it's probably the nature of scientists trying to not ... or
yeah, as long as it goes through and it gets to the funding agents then we're happy and basically
the rest did not really occur to me ever that I would have to actively look for an ethical committee,
I always thought that and other requirements or whatever would be taken [care] of by the [...]
grants managing entity in [my university] or the other universities. (Interviewee 3)
The interviewees who had not had their project reviewed, or were unsure if it had
been reviewed, confessed that they were unsure of their institutional ethics
220 Research Ethics 11(4)
procedure and had either neglected to think about ethics at the time of the application
or had assumed/hoped that someone else (either another member of the research
team or someone in their institution) would take care of, or assume responsibility
for, this on their behalf. Although these researchers were in the minority (indicating,
perhaps, that consideration of ethics is becoming the norm rather than the excep-
tion), the question of who should take responsibility for ensuring that projects have
been ethically reviewed looms large here. Certainly more could be done to empower
researchers to take responsibility for the ethical conduct of their research and the
collaborative relationships they enter into. However, it would seem that current grant
application and funding mechanisms play a key role in enabling abstention and fail-
ure to engage meaningfully with research ethics.
Only five questionnaire respondents confirmed that their project had been
reviewed by a REC in the host country (Table 3). One felt very strongly that all
research handling personal data should be subject to ethical review first in the host
country (if this was not the PI's country of residence) before being reviewed by the
PI's institutional REC (or appropriate professional body), a response which ques-
tioned directly the validity of undertaking ethical review in a developed country if
the research is being undertaken in an entirely different socio-cultural, economic,
and environmental context (Honan et al., 2013). There is some support for a one-
track approach given the increased level of detail and amount of documentation
now required by many RECs, the increasing number and complexity of the rules

to which researchers are expected to adhere, and the ever growing raft of univer-
sity and government regulations that are being put in place to regulate research
conduct (Stewart, 2011; Mollet, 2011). However, it is generally agreed that
research collaborations between developed and developing countries should be
ethically reviewed in both the host and the PI's country of residence as standard
practice (Hyder et al., 2004), thus enabling the specificities of each context to be
taken into account (Ravinetto et al., 2011). One has to assume that the paucity of
developing country RECs had a significant impact on the number of projects
reviewed within the host countries, but there are a number of other possible rea-
sons why researchers from developed countries may fail to apply for ethical
approval in a developing country regardless of REC availability, including: igno-
rance, perceptions of cost, an assumption that certain research is exempt (as dem-
onstrated above), arrogance or paternalism (Van Teijlingen and Simkhada, 2012).
As demonstrated by the quotes from Interviewees 3 and 4 above, at least some of
the ESPA/ESRC-DFID award holders fall into one or more of these categories.
The questionnaire respondent with strong views on host country review further
advocated that if the local partners had no REC, they should be supported to estab-
lish one. When the interviewees were asked to respond to this suggestion there was
some debate as to where responsibility for this might lie, but they all felt that it was
unfeasible to include this within the remit of a single project. The key prohibiting
factors were the relatively short duration of the projects, funding limitations, and
the amount of institutional support required by RECs to make them credible (e.g.
independent ethical review boards ­ especially those which charged a fee ­ were
seen as being venal). As Interviewee 1 commented:
I really don't think it's feasible because, you know, basically the developing countries that I've
worked in, any sort of regulation is minimal, is easily corrupted, is easily bent and I think that
while it would be admirable to put resources to that, we've already talked about the difficulty of
carving up the resources and working in these places and I just, to be honest I just don't see that,
but I do think that, you know, we try and work by example and we have growing numbers of
colleagues who've maybe been through the UK system or similar systems with ethics training
and who take that very seriously and who [...] apply those practices in their own works so I
think that being realistic about it that's about as good as you can get and being quite clear that
you don't get involved in projects where there's going to be contravention. That may be slightly
too pragmatic and not sufficiently idealistic a response but I can't begin to envisage [...] to set
up an ethics committee. I can envisage having those discussions with people at every opportunity
and raising it as an issue and expecting the best standards from people and encouraging the best
standards.
In general, although host-country REC review was a valid and highly desirable
long-term goal, the interviewees felt that for the time being it would be sufficient
for ESPA to insist that all projects go through some form of approved institutional
ethical review (regardless of where this took place) on the understanding that the
222 Research Ethics 11(4)
ethics protocols for each project had been developed through cross-country dia-
logue (Tikly and Bond, 2013) and that the project partners would discuss the ethics
of their research at every opportunity. In the meantime, it should be the funding
bodies (ESPA included) and the PI institutions who took responsibility for helping
to establish robust host country RECs.
Eighteen questionnaire respondents confirmed that their project involved work-
ing with local NGOs and/or experts not named on the grant application, while 17
said that their project involved working with translators and/or local field assis-
tants (Table 4). When asked if relevant Codes of Conduct and/or ethical guidelines
had been, or would be, communicated to all members of the project team (includ-
ing local NGOs and/or experts, translators and/or local field assistants), only three
said no. The interview data suggested, however, that the channels of communica-
tion were stronger in some projects than others and ranged from ad hoc discussion
of ethical issues as they arose through to providing specific research training for
translators and/or local field assistants:
it's, exactly, not a conscious decision but more, yeah, but we'd never really thought about it [...]
we know each other pretty well as a team and, yeah, solve problems when they come [up].
(Interviewee 3)
We have a kind of system of a three or four day pre-testing. So that starts with, you know,
careful explanations of the questionnaire or if it's qualitative, you know, the focus group, and
then they do role plays amongst themselves, and that's actually very effective for screening out,
you know, people seem to learn much more if they get a chance. [...] After that couple of days
of kind of workshop-based training, then they go to the community and try out again and then
come back and review and sort of ... and it gives us a chance to review the questions as well
(Interviewee 5)
One interviewee who had answered `yes'to this question clarified that all collabo-
rating partners involved in undertaking the fieldwork had been sent the ethics
application and the comments of the REC, but it was left up to them which ele-
ments of this they passed on to their field assistants and that they would not know
until the final field study report what training had been provided and to whom.
This devolvement of responsibility is particularly interesting given that research
data collection in the type of project funded by ESPA frequently takes place in
areas which are physically and economically distanced from the PI's institution
(Kingori, 2013). As a result, a great deal pivots on data collectors' practices and
views (Kingori, 2013), and as Interviewee 1 demonstrated above, many play a
crucial and often under-recognized and under-supported role in `doing ethics' in
the field, with important implications for the success and quality of the research
itself. If the collaborating partners fail to take them seriously as collaborators and
partners in research endeavours (Molyneux and Geissler, 2008) and to adequately
support their decision-making, it could have very serious consequences for the

research findings. For example, compliance with research ethics protocols may be
far more difficult to achieve in poor countries where basic infrastructure is lacking
(Heimer, 2013), and local fieldworkers face significant challenges in mediating
between the very different priorities and concerns of research institutions and
224 Research Ethics 11(4)
low-income communities in which they may themselves live (Molyneux and
Geissler, 2008; Kingori, 2013). Without discussion, these issues may never come
to light.
Attitudes towards ethics documentation and guidance
Chilisa (2005: 676) highlights that collaborative research between developed and
developing countries `invariably'begins with a contract that positions the research-
ers within a hierarchical structure in a "framework which goes back to colonial
times, when the colonized were regarded as empty vessels to be filled". A decade
on, the ESPA and ESRC-DFID funding schemes appear to be well aware of the
fundamental importance of "strong collaborative partnerships with local and
established individuals, institutions and structures" (Molyneux and Geissler, 2008:
690). On the whole, the questionnaire respondents registered a high degree of col-
laboration amongst the project partners at all stages of the research design and
implementation across the projects surveyed (Table 4). Of the 18 respondents who
answered the question, however, less than half said that the relationship between
the project partners on their grant had been, or was, subject to monitoring and
evaluation (Table 4). These monitoring and evaluation strategies tended to be
based on established institutional codes of conduct or working agreements (e.g.
consultancy contracts) or had been developed organically to suit the needs of the
research programme and the individual partners. As Interviewee 2 explained:
we decided to design a fairly very simple [...] [two-strand] strategy, that [...] helps to track
implementation and execution of the project, [...] as we designed it, [...] one of them is to
monitor the quality of work we do, another one is to monitor collaboration [and this] looks at
the honour and the respect that is given to intellectual property and the contribution of business.
The interviewees stressed, however, that this type of agreement requires commit-
ment and sustained input from all parties to be successful and of mutual benefit.
Several of those whose projects did not have a formal monitoring and evaluation
strategy challenged this `unnecessary bureaucratization' (Stanley and Wise, 2010,
in Monaghan et al., 2013), arguing that it was often impractical or unfeasible to
expect individuals to work to strict deadlines (which they associated with such
procedures), that it would add undue pressure to an already pressurized working
situation, that it would add another level of `complication'to the project, that there
was not enough time to do this given the short duration of many of the projects (the
average was 28 months) and that it would be an unnecessary burden given the
seemingly endless amount of reporting that researchers are now expected to do
during the life-course of a research project. As Interviewee 4 noted:
There is no formal monitoring process [in our project] where we evaluate the participation of
each partner. It's an informal process where, you know, if you participate ... the more you
Morris 225
contribute, the more you appear in scientific publications, [...] what you put in is what you get
out, more or less. But, you know, it isn't ... it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to come up with
a formal monitoring programme of partner activities, but it's ... it would complicate things. It's
a two year project so there's very little, you know, not a lot of time to do the actual work and
there's already so many forms [...] that we don't want to complicate things any further.
Several interviewees questioned why the success of a project could not be judged
simply on its deliverables, for without good working relationships no outputs
would ever be produced ­ an opinion which suggests a slightly naïve approach to
the power imbalances which can occur in this type of research.
Formal IPR agreements covering data and results, publications, and authorship
were also relatively scarce and only seven questionnaire respondents confirmed
that their project had this type of accord in place and that all the project partners
named on the grant application had been required to sign up (literally and meta-
phorically) to it prior to the commencement of the research (Table 4). These tended
to be based on the rules of the Vancouver Protocol, sometimes with additional
clauses covering the inclusion of collaborators from the host country in the publi-
cation of the research findings. Those interviewees without a formal agreement
cited, by way of explanation, the lack of a perceived demand from the funders,
lack of time, a desire to avoid additional bureaucracy, a lack of interest among
non-academic partners in peer-reviewed publications, the presence of already
well-established collaborative relationships and/or non-project-specific blanket
ethics clearance agreements. Interviewee 3 noted:
[I'm] not very keen [on IPR agreements] because it's a lot of bureaucracy. [...] So if not really
necessarily, I try to avoid as much as I can, because [it's] bureaucracy for me, for them, and in
general so far it has worked very well. Also because they have, the other partners they're
typically, at least those that I work with have less interest in really peer-review publications, it's
of course nice and it's great for the CV, but it's not going to change their life, particularly the
NGOs. On the other hand, they are much more concerned with outreach publications and so I
... and then of course I do collaborate with them on writing outreach publications and I probably
have more than a typical scientist, because I believe that it's important just for the type of stuff
we're doing and because it's a great way to get our research into policy of course, but we have,
somehow we are flexible about that, yeah, and I admit being guilty of having put strategic
co-authors on papers sometimes just, just, yeah, well, but try to find a balance between those,
but yeah, I've never really felt the need.
It is not uncommon for academics to prefer peer-reviewed papers (a desire driven
in part by the need to secure yet more funding, establish professional reputations,
earn promotion, etc.) and for non-academic partners to place more weight on pro-
ject reports which might assist them in obtaining further funding and/or impacting
upon policy (Jeffery, 2014). However, it was startling how freely this interviewee
admitted to `authorship disintegrity'(Abu-Zaid et al., 2014) and one would assume
that if it is this easy to add authors then it must be just as easy to leave other con-
tributors off.
226 Research Ethics 11(4)
That said, it would be wrong to assume that agreements regarding IPR were
completely absent in those projects with no formal accord. For some interviewees
at the start of their funding IPR agreements were not yet in place but were on the
agenda and had featured in early discussions. Others spoke of tacit agreements with
their collaborating partners regarding who was entitled to have their name attrib-
uted to which publications. In general, these informal arrangements were said to
work well, but what was less clear was how they were policed, how decisions were
made regarding author order, how and to whom grievances might be aired, or
whether some individuals (particularly those who were not named on the funding
application given that 18 questionnaire respondents said that their project included
this type of person) might find this type of working arrangement more pressured or
stressful than if a formal agreement had been in place from the outset. Undoubtedly
there can be problems with authorship agreements: staff may change, differing dis-
ciplinary or cultural expectations can make for awkward negotiations (Jeffery,
2014; Teixeira da Silva, 2011), and the research may change as it progresses, neces-
sitating re-evaluation of the agreement (Friedman Ross et al., 2010). However, a
`pre-contract' with an agreed ethical approach to authorship and contribution at the
start of the project (Hayter et al., 2013) means that there will always be a point of
reference which can provide guidelines and clarification (Henry, 2013).
Only 16 questionnaire respondents answered when asked if there had been, or
were, any tensions in the relationship(s) between the collaborating partners on
their project (Table 4). The seven who said yes identified budget allocation (e.g.
informal approach to accounting on the part of one partner, the practical allocation
of funds), commitment to deadlines (e.g. some partners' unwillingness to prior-
itize the project above other projects they were involved in, partners failing to
make the inputs they promised at the proposal stage), and differing work practices
(e.g. different approaches to field research in different disciplines, division of
labour, timing of inputs) as the main sources of tension. The interview quotes
below highlight two different scenarios:
we were working with [...] an NGO and they had their own rules and regulations [...], what we
were doing was providing them with the money to allow them to employ the researchers, the
associates on our project but they saw them as part of their team, so they, [...] were actually
expected to go on team building weeks and [do specific work] within the organization, which
has sometimes cut across what we wanted them to do. [...] because they were then members of
the [NGO] team, they had to follow the rules about expenses and travelling allowances and [...]
we were prepared to say, I mean, because these funds are trivial in our terms, you know, [...] if
you can't come by train, for God's sake, buy an air ticket and, and go you know, it's, it's within
the budget, but then the rules [of that] organization said, that if these people are allowed to do
that, then we have to do it for everybody else, and we can't have that. (Interviewee 7)
... we thought that it would be appropriate to have [a] partner organization [in CountryA] which
specializes in [X skill] and broadly speaking that works [...] they were actually recommended
Morris 227
to me by the other partners who have worked with them in the past. [...] but because of the way
that the project was structured [...] we ended up with a situation where the three research
institutes got the lion's share of the overheads. That was very upsetting to the [skilled] group
and partly because of the timeline and partly because of the fact that sort of doing this over
Skype and email that we just didn't really get to a point where they were completely happy with
... I found as many ways as I could to make it work for them but essentially I think that they felt
that they were marginalized by that process. You could say they were. (Interviewee 1)
This interviewee acknowledged that a number of these issues could have been
dealt with more effectively by the management of expectations, but they pointed
out that the lack of regular face-to-face contact (which is a common feature of
research of this type due to the geographical distribution of the project partners)
can hinder the successful resolution of problems. This shows that while formal
ethics guidelines play an important role in regulating research practice, implicit
day-to-day social relations and engagements between people are fundamental to
the research process (Molyneux and Geissler, 2008). A situated research ethics as
opposed to a universal ethics requires a contextualized understanding of the
research process itself, which partly revolves around the politics of partnership
and demonstrates the need to engage with the complexities of power relations not
only between the researcher and researched (Tikly and Bond, 2013) but also
between the collaborating partners. The establishment of trust through relation-
ship-building seems to be particularly important here, taking time to listen to each
other's concerns, interests and needs and incorporating them into the research
agenda (Friedman Ross, 2010).
One respondent felt very strongly that ESPA were wasting their time creating
what would inevitably be another set of universal guidelines wherein western
notions would be applied to societies in which attitudes and practices were very
different. Yet 19 agreed that ethics guidelines could be useful in heightening
researchers'sensitivity to ethical issues. When asked to elaborate, the interviewees
noted that the guidance such as that proposed by ESPA could potentially raise
issues that the researchers may not have been aware of or may have ignored in the
past (e.g. their privileged position and relative wealth) (Molyneux and Geissler,
2008). Whilst it was indeed wrong to assume that biomedically-rooted research
ethics could be universally applicable, the principles inherent in the ethical con-
duct of research ­ integrity, respect for persons, beneficence, and justice ­ still
provided a useful yardstick against which to measure research practice (Honan
et al., 2013).
A key concern was the inability of standardized REC protocols to take into
account ethical issues that arise in the field and the many evolving situational
judgements that social (and one could argue natural science) researchers must
make as their project develops and circumstances change (Klitzman, 2012; Heimer,
2013; Darling, 2014). Standardized REC procedures tend to assume that the full
228 Research Ethics 11(4)
scope of a research study and suite of participants/actors with whom one will come
into contact can be anticipated in advance (Boden et al., 2009); however, as Blee
and Currier (2011) point out, knowledge production is temporally, spatially and
culturally bounded. All the interviewees stressed that context is crucial in the type
of research that ESPA funds and that any ethics procedure and documentation
must be flexible enough to facilitate rather than inhibit their work, allowing them
to take different customs into account (e.g. age at which one becomes an adult,
nature of consent) and adjust to local circumstances without the need for a revised
ethics assessment (Araali, 2011). As Interviewee 7 argued:
I think some of the ethics literature is not very helpful at all. It's, kind of, dancing on the point
of a needle to make fine, fine judgements about things, which you can't make fine judgements
about in practice, particularly not in developing country settings. [...] there are real potentials
for making ethics make research impossible, [...] the idea that, you know, you set it all out in
advance, and if you change it, if you go back [...] to the ethics committee, to [...] approval of
anything, any change ... well, ethnographic field work is always adjusting to local
circumstances and you can't go back, [...] and get further approval, because, you know, [...]
it takes six months out of, you know, a year's field work time ... you've lost it ... you've just
completely lost the project. [...] the other thing [...] we had [...] is that the local ethical
review board starts saying, `oh we don't think much of this project, you ought to be doing this
instead', and we think, `well we just got funded to do this', you know, how many times are
we going to go forwards and backwards with people who say, `we don't think you can do the
research because it's not ethically viable because it's not scientifically viable or valid', and
then you have to go back to the funders and say `we're having to change the programme', you
know, and then you come and go, again, for six months before you're allowed to start. And
it's, it's usually trivial.
Guilleman and Gillam (2004, cited in Honan et al., 2013) make a distinction
between macroethics (the domain in which RECs institute general principles for
ethical research conduct in the field) and microethics (everyday ethical dilemmas
in specific research contexts), while Heimer (2013) notes the disparity between
official ethics (ethics on the books) and ethics on the ground (ethics in action).
Both argue that ethics form part of "an ongoing process that is always subject to
negotiation and reinterpretation rather than reification outside the research con-
text" (Monaghan et al., 2013: 68). It is important that ethics guidance uphold core
ethical principles, but it has to meet the contextual needs of the researchers (Guta
et al., 2012) and give them the security to adapt methods as they see fit without the
need for further review (McCormack et al., 2012).
The interviewees also felt ethical guidance should be sensitive to specific issues
such as the disruption of social norms. Although one interviewee noted that the
whole ethos of their discipline was to cause as little disruption as possible, the
majority felt that an element of disruption was inevitable given the nature of the
projects that ESPA funds (e.g. engaging with local communities, knowledge
Morris 229
exchange, development), that this would happen regardless of where the researcher
was from, and that it was not necessarily always a bad thing. For example:
Well I guess there ... it's a kind of a utilitarian perspective somewhat, which is the social norms,
are they in the good of society as whole? So if it's a social norm, for example, that women have
no control over certain household assets or livestock, it may be, in the short term, [...] something
which is useful for the men, but in the long term, it's not useful for the society as a whole. So I
think that you shouldn't do ... disrupt social norms just for the sake of it, or if harm could result,
but if, if ... sometimes social norms have to change in order for development to happen. So,
basically, it's something we should be careful about, think it through, but certainly not a blanket,
you know. I mean female circumcision is a social norm. (Interviewee 5)
A clear distinction was made between positive and negative disruption; whilst
any social interaction is disruptive, the consensus amongst the interviewees was
that it is important to ensure that it is supportive and encouraging rather than
aggressive and unpleasant. The overall sense was that no set of guidance notes
would ever be able (or should indeed try) to take all eventualities into account and
it was impractical to ask researchers to document these on a form, However,
researchers must be aware of their potential impact on the situations they found
themselves in and the people they come into contact with, and realize that there
might be a lasting impact that remains long after the research is complete
(Molyneux and Geissler, 2008). Likewise, researchers must find ways to recog-
nize and strengthen the agency of so-called vulnerable individuals, groups and
communities, whom institutional review has thus far only viewed as candidates
for protection (London, 2002).
Conclusions
The principle aim of this research was to produce an ethics form and accompany-
ing guidance notes for the ESPA research community which would sensitize
members to the ethical issues associated with undertaking collaborative research
in developing countries. Despite the small sample size, the findings from the sur-
vey and interview data suggest that the participants did accept the importance of,
and need for, ethical review when undertaking collaborative work in developing
countries (Librett and Perrone, 2010) and that they were more likely than not to
have had their ESPA/ESRC-DIFD projects reviewed. However, negative percep-
tions of what this entails (e.g. time, effort, bureaucracy) and /or an ambivalence
towards ethics have in the past meant that some respondents have not taken ethi-
cal assessment seriously (Dyer and Demeritt, 2008; Mollet, 2011) or have avoided
it where possible. As such, consideration of ethics appears to have been the result
of external drivers rather than a desire to critically think through research practice
and the nature of the collaborative relationships in which these researchers were
230 Research Ethics 11(4)
participating. Whilst there appears to be a particular need to raise awareness of
the relevance and potential benefits of ethical review amongst natural science
researchers and/or those using modelling or secondary data, it would seem that
part of the problem lies not necessarily with `ethics'per se but with the prevailing
systems of ethical governance and the bureaucracies imposed by current REC
regulation (Emmerich, 2013). For example, even those participants who had
attempted to fully engage with their institutional ethics procedures (or those of a
relevant professional body) expressed dissatisfaction with the rigidity of REC
regulation and highlighted the difficulty of applying certain principles in devel-
oping world contexts ­ critiques which are already well-established within the
literature.
The respondents cautioned against fostering a compliance culture wherein to
be `ethical' means to conform to the `prescriptions and proscriptions' of the REC
(Hammersley, 2014). Their advice was that the ESPA guidance should facilitate a
situated ethics (Ekberg, 2012) which appreciated the need for flexibility and gave
researchers the confidence and support to make in situ decisions without the need
for further validation. This would require a rethinking of ethics as `practice' and
an appreciation (on the part of the REC) of the locally specific relationships
between the researchers and researched, but also require a higher degree of reflex-
ivity (on the part of the researcher) in relation to the research process and their
collaborative relationships. For example, there is a need to raise awareness of the
mutual benefits and reassurances that can be derived from formal agreements
(e.g. in relation to IPR, collaborative relationships with non-academic partners,
monitoring and evaluation procedures). Conversely, there is also a need to recog-
nize that long-standing collaborative relationships or blanket ethics clearance
agreements between institutions may lead to complacency and prevent new pro-
jects from being ethically assessed on a case by case basis. A key determinant of
the above of course is time; grant recipients must be encouraged and enabled to
build time into their projects to think about the practicalities of ethical research
and share this information with their collaborating partners to form mutually
agreeable parameters.
The overall sense from the research participants was that ESPA's initiative was
not misguided per se as it would go some way towards ensuring that proper respect
was shown to the people with whom, and environments that, ESPA funded
researchers came into contact with, particularly given the dearth of RECs in the
developing world. In this sense, the ESPA ethics guidance notes would not be ask-
ing the researchers to do anything different from what they should be doing any-
way; rather, they would encourage the researchers to give in-depth consideration
to the ethical issues involved in their research, whether it involved human partici-
pants or not, to ensure that they had ethical clearance from the appropriate authori-
ties/people, and ensure that their protocols were locally appropriate (de Vries et al.,
Morris 231
2011). That said, it was recommended that if the PI was based in the UK (or in an
institution outside the UK which has a robust REC), the research should be ethi-
cally reviewed by their institution REC or ESPA, but not by both. RECs which
lack experience in, or are uninformed about, this type of research sometimes have
a `paternalistic' tendency to require researchers to take additional (and often dis-
proportionate) precautions to ensure the `safety' of the research participants
(Klitzman, 2012; de Vries et al., 2011); in such cases the researchers would be able
to draw on the ESPA guidance in order to justify their protocols. Any guidance
issued by ESPA should of course be subject to periodic renewal and revision
(Bond, 2012). In time, the hope would be that all ESPA grant recipients would
make every effort to get all, or at least part of, their proposed research reviewed by
a robust REC in the host country. However, it was recognized that this may not be
possible in some countries for a considerable length of time. Just who should be
responsible for helping to facilitate the development of robust host country RECs
remains to be seen, but the respondents were keen to place this burden at the feet
of funding bodies such as ESPA and the PI institutions rather than the award
holders.
