Objective: To increase understanding about current dietary patterns and short-term relationships between
economic change and adolescent nutrition in a lower-income country, using the 1991 and 1993 China Health and
Nutrition Survey data.
Design: Cross-sectional study.
Setting: Eight provinces in China that vary substantially in geography, economic development, public resources,
and health indicators.
Subjects: 2236 and 2018 adolescents aged 10 ± 18 years who completed three 24-hour recalls in the 1991 and
1993 survey, respectively.
Results: Chinese adolescents experienced an improvement of diet and nutritional status. The prevalence of
stunting declined from 23% in 1991 to 19% in 1993. Under-nutrition was a problem of concern although the
prevalence (12 ± 13%) was relatively low. Overweight was emerging as a problem associated with young, high-
income and urban adolescents, but the prevalence (4%) was quite low compared with developed countries.
Chinese adolescents' energy and protein intakes were adequate compared with the American RDA. About 27%
of the participants derived more than 30% of their dietary energy from fat and 16% of them derived over 10% of
energy from saturated fat by 1993.
Conclusion: Chinese adolescents have experienced an improvement in diet and nutritional status, but under-
nutrition is still an important nutrition problem, especially among young and poor groups. More attention should
focus on the increase of dietary fat intake and obesity.

Introduction
Adolescents are de®ned by the World Health Organization
(WHO, 1986) as persons aged 10 ± 19 years. They comprise
20% of the global population, and about 80% of them live
in developing countries (United Nations, 1997). During this
important period of growth and maturation, children gain
20% and 50% of their adult height and weight, respectively
(Mahan and Escott-Stump, 1996). Sexual maturation and
the shift toward independence in decision making make this
an important period. Body composition and dietary patterns
acquired during this period are likely to be continued as
adults (Rolland-Cachera et al, 1987, 1989; Serdula et al,
1993). It is important for adolescents to lay out the
foundation for chronic disease prevention by the promotion
and maintenance of healthful lifestyles (US Public Health
Service, 1990). Therefore, for a wide variety of reasons
related to the rapid physical and emotional development
during this period, adolescence represents a period of peak
concern.
Little attention has been paid to adolescent nutrition in
developing countries. A series of studies conducted with
small unrepresentative samples in Latin America and the
Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia represent the most
complete examination of this topic (International Center for
Research on Women, 1994; Kurz, 1996). Girls and boys
were included in seven of the eleven studies. Stunting was
highly prevalent (around 50%) in nine of these studies and
in all three Asian countries studied (Philippines, Nepal, and
India). Current or acute under-nutrition was relatively low
in most of these samples (3 ± 13%), except in three coun-
tries. Adolescent girls were reported at a higher risk of
dietary inadequacy and poorer nutritional status than boys
in several countries of Asia (Waslien and Stewart, 1994).
However, there is minimal understanding about adolescent
dietary patterns in developing countries.
Studies from industrialized countries show that adoles-
cents have unique dietary patterns. Adolescents may place
themselves at particular nutritional risk by choosing to
follow extreme eating patterns (Bull, 1988; American
School Health Association et al, 1989; Kann et al, 1995;
Krebs-Smith et al, 1996; Siega-Riz et al, 1998). Dieting
and skipping meals are common practice among adoles-
cents in the United States and other Western countries
(McGuf®n, 1983; Skinner et al, 1985; Bull, 1988). The
prevalence of obesity among US adolescents is over 20%
and still increasing (Troiano et al, 1995; US Department of
Health and Human Services, 1997; Popkin & Udry, 1998).

Research on child nutrition in several lower and middle
income countries shows that obesity is emerging as an
important problem (Mo-Suwan et al, 1993; Mo-Suwan &
Geater, 1996; Popkin et al, 1996). Of greatest concern are
the biological and behavioral risk factors linking adolescent
obesity and adult health.
China's population accounts for about one-quarter of the
world population; and the 217.4 million adolescents aged
10 ± 19 years comprise 19.2% of the nation's population
(United Nations, 1997). Rapid economic development has
signi®cantly reduced physical activity among Chinese
adults as well as being associated with a marked change
in the structure of the adult diet and body composition
(Smith, 1993; Popkin et al, 1993, 1995a, b; Ge et al, 1994;
Popkin, 1994; Chen, 1996; Chen & Xu, 1996). Some
national nutrition surveys show that, during the past several
decades, younger Chinese children have experienced a
steady increase in weight and height and also a marked
shift from problems of under-nutrition to those of over-
weight during the past several decades (Zhang & Huang,
1988; Lin et al, 1992b; Popkin et al, 1996; Shen et al,
1996), but little further study about adolescent nutrition in
China has been conducted.
To understand current patterns as well as short-term
relationships between economic change and adolescent
nutrition, we investigated the effects of gender, age, house-
hold income and residence on the nutritional status and
macronutrient intakes of Chinese adolescents in a cross-
sectional analysis.
Materials and methods
Survey design
The China Health and Nutrition Surveys (CHNS) are
longitudinal. They cover eight provinces (Guangxi, Guiz-
hou, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Liaoning and Shan-
dong provinces) that vary substantially in geography,
economic development, public resources and health indi-
cators. A multistage, random-cluster process was used to
draw the sample surveyed in each of the provinces. Coun-
ties in the eight provinces were initially strati®ed by
income (low, middle and high), and a weighted sampling
scheme was used to select randomly four counties in
each province. Within each county, the township capital
was selected, and three villages were chosen randomly.
Each provincial capital and a lower income city from
each province were selected. This analysis was con®ned
to 2236 and 2018 adolescents aged 10 ± 18 years
who were surveyed in 1991 and 1993, respectively. (See
either the World Wide Web site for the China Health
and Nutrition Survey (http:aawww.cpc.unc.eduaprojectsa
chinaachina_home.htmlt) or Popkin et al (1993) for details
on the sampling.)
Anthropometric data
Measurements of weight and height were obtained from all
subjects. Anthropometric measurements were carried out
by trained health workers who followed standard protocol
similar to the NHANES protocol developed by the National
Center for Health Statistics. In addition, all interviewers
had to take inter-observer reliability tests as part of the
training. Weight was measured in light indoor clothing to
the nearest 0.1 kg with a beam balance scale. Height was
measured without shoes to the nearest 0.1 cm using a
portable stadiometer. Each of these measurements was
carried out by at least two health workersÐone took the
measurements while a second recorded the readings.
Sociodemographic data
The data concerning income and age are relevant to this
analysis and special attention has been paid to them. During
the household interview, questions about income were
asked for all income-producing activities that each family
member had engaged in. Full income from market and non-
market activities, such as non-monetary government sub-
sidies (such as food ration coupons) was recorded. Accord-
ing to the practice in China, both the Western and Chinese
calendars were used when collecting age data, with the
traditional Chinese dates later converted into Western
dates.
Dietary data
Detailed household food consumption data and individual
dietary intake data were collected for 3 consecutive days.
The sample was randomly allocated from Monday to
Sunday and almost equally balanced across the 7 days of
the week from each sampling unit. Household food con-
sumption was determined from inventory change from the
beginning to the end of each day. Individual dietary intake
data for the same 3 consecutive days were obtained from all
family members based on a 24-h recall basis by asking each
individualÐexcept for young children, whose mothers
were asked. From the household dietary data, information
on the added fat (cooking oil represents a signi®cant
component of fat intake for this sample of Chinese) and
other condiments was used to supplement the individual
dietary intake data (Zhai et al, 1996). The collection of
household and individual dietary intake allowed us to check
the quality of each against the other. At the time of data
collection, the individual and household dietary data were
compared and used to identify major discrepancies. Where
signi®cant discrepancies were found, the household and the
individual in question were revisited and asked about their
food consumption to resolve these discrepancies.
The survey team comprised 20 ± 23 trained nutritionists
for each of the eight provinces in 1991 and 1993. They
worked full time in the respective provinces and had
experience in other national nutrition surveys. All inter-
viewers were trained for 10 days (in 1991) or 8 days (1993)
over a 2-week period in methods of data collection. Inter-
viewers were required to follow a carefully developed
protocol. The 1991 China Food Consumption Table (Insti-
tute of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, 1991) was used to
calculate adolescent nutrient intakes from dietary data. The
Chinese RDA and the American RDA for protein and
energy (National Research Council, 1989) were used
when evaluating macro-nutrient intakes.
Statistical analysis
Body mass index (BMI  weightaheight2) and height-for-
age Z-scores were calculated for each individual. Stunting
was de®ned as height-for-age below 72 s.d. (Z-score) from
the NCHSaWHO reference median value (WHO, 1986).
Under-nutrition was de®ned as age- and gender-speci®c
BMI less than the 5th centile of the NCHSaWHO refer-
ence; overweight was de®ned as BMI 85th centile (WHO
Expert Committee, 1995). The WHO-recommended BMI
cut-offs are based on the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANESI) of the United States
National Center for Health Statistics, and the data were

WHO Expert committee, 1995).
Tertiles of household income based on distribution were
used when conducting data analysis to assess the effect of
income. Adjusted prevalences of stunting, under-nutrition,
and overweight were calculated controlling for covariates.
When comparing differences of energy and nutrient
intakes, least-squares means were calculated to control
for covariates. Age was adjusted as a continuous variable,
and income as two dummy variables (low income and high
income). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was con-
ducted when risk factors of stunting, under-nutrition, and
overweight were estimated. All odd ratios (OR) presented
were adjusted for potential confounders. Analysis was
performed using SAS (version 6.12, Cary, NC, USA) and
Stat (version 5.0, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Complete anthropometric and sociodemographic data were
available for 2079 and 1858 adolescents aged 10 ± 18 years
in the 1991 and 1993 surveys, respectively. Table 1
summarizes the average of height, weight and BMI of the
study population surveyed in 1991 and 1993. Most results
are strati®ed by two age groups (10 ± 13 years and 14 ±
18 years) based on the following considerations. The
sample is inadequate to present more detailed age break-
downs. The selection of the age breakdown is based on
biological and social behavior characteristics of Chinese
adolescents. This sample and a number of previous studies
of Chinese adolescents indicate that the average age of
menarche for Chinese girls is between 13 and 14 years
(Yie, 1991; Lin et al, 1992a; Liu, 1997). In addition, in
China the transition to middle schools usually occurs at the
age of 14 years.
Nutritional status
Stunting (height-for-age): Low height-for-age might be
an indicator of long-term nutritional experience or growth
impairment caused by malnutrition in the past, although it
is argued that the major cause of short stature during
adolescence is genetically late initiation of puberty
(Mahan & Escott-Stump, 1996). Table 2 shows that the
adjusted prevalence of stunting declined from 23% in 1991
to 19% by 1993. Logistic regression analysis found that
stunting was associated with gender, age, residence and
family income. In 1993, for urban residence, the adjusted
OR was 0.46 (0.32, 0.64); compared with middle income,
the OR was 0.70 (0.51, 0.97) for high income and 1.30
(0.98, 1.71) for low income. The interaction between
gender and age was signi®cant. The adjusted OR for
young age (10 ± 13 years) was 0.56 (0.40, 0.79) among
boys, and 1.11 (0.79, 1.57) among girls. Being female
was associated with increased risk ((OR  1.45
(1.02, 2.07)) among young adolescents, but not among
older adolescents (OR  0.73 (0.52, 1.01)). The 1991
results were similar to the 1993 ®ndings.
Undernutrition (BMI ` 5th centile): Adolescence is an
important time for gaining weight as well as height. As
shown in Table 3, the prevalence of under-nutrition was
relatively low (12 ± 13%) among the participants during
1991 ± 1993. More boys than girls were under-nourished in
both years (P ` 0.05). In 1993, girls were at decreased risk
among older adolescents (OR  0.36 (0.22, 0.59)) but not
among young adolescents (OR  0.93 (0.67, 1.30)). The
®ndings were similar for 1991. Approximately twice as
many young adolescents (18%) as older adolescents (9%)
were under-nourished. Compared with middle-income ado-
lescents, high-income adolescents were less likely to be
under-nourished. The adjusted OR was 0.70 (0.50, 0.98) in
1991 and 0.59 (0.42, 0.83) in 1993.
Overweight (BMI!85th centile): Table 3 shows that
about 4% of these adolescents were overweight or obese.
The prevalence among young adolescents was much higher
than that among the older group (P ` 0.05). Results of

Nutrition and diet of Chinese adolescents
Y Wang et al

logistic regression analysis suggest that overweight was
emerging as a problem associated with being young (10 ±
13 years), coming from high-income families, and living in
urban areas. The 1991 data show that young adolescents
were at increased risk (OR  1.84 (1.18, 2.87)), and boys in
urban areas or from high-income families were more likely
to be overweightÐthe ORs were 2.12 (1.11, 4.07) relative
to rural residence and 2.56 (1.25, 5.25) relative to middle
income. In contrast, these associations were not signi®cant
among girls. Among rural adolescents or adolescents from
low- and middle-income families, girls were at increased
risk relative to boys (OR  2.29 (1.20, 4.39)). Findings
were slightly different in 1993. Young age was a stronger
predictor for overweight (OR  3.35 (2.00, 5.62)). Com-
pared to boys, girls in urban areas were less likely to be
overweight (OR  0.22 (0.07, 0.65)), but girls from low-
income families were at increased risk (OR  2.83
(1.19, 6.74)). The greater risk for low-income girls might
be part of the emergence of more problems of dietary
excess among the poor in China.
Dietary patterns
In the 1991 and 1993 surveys, 2236 and 2018 adolescents
had individual dietary data, respectively. The mean dietary
intakes of adolescents for speci®c age, residence and
gender groups are shown in Table 4. In general, rural
adolescents ate more cereals and carbohydrate but less
animal foods, total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol than
urban adolescents, although their energy and protein
intakes were similar. Rural adolescents derived about
70% of their energy from carbohydrates and 20 ± 23%
from fat, while urban adolescents derived only about 60%
from carbohydrates and 26 ± 29% from fat. The percentage
of energy (en%) derived from fat increased by 1993 but
decreased for carbohydrate.
We also estimated Chinese adolescents' nutrient intakes
using the adjusted mean percentages of energy and
protein intakes relative to the American RDA. Controlling
for gender, age, residence and family income, Chinese

Nutrition and diet of Chinese adolescents
Y Wang et al
911
adolescents consumed about 20 ± 35% (in the 1991 survey)
and 10 ± 24% (1993) above the RDA for energy, while
female, young and rural adolescents consumed a greater
amount of energy relative to the RDA than male, older and
urban adolescents, respectively (P ` 0.05). Only 2 ± 3% of
the participants consumed energy less than 2a3 of the
American RDA during 1991 ± 1993. Using the Chinese
RDA for comparison, urban girls were found to consume
less food energy than recommended, 1 ± 3% less in 1991
and 5 ± 7% less in 1993, and this varied by family income.
These ®gures may suggest the emergence of weight con-
sciousness and dieting among urban girls.
On average, Chinese adolescents consumed about twice
as much protein as the American RDA, and their protein
consumption varied by gender, age and residence. Boys
consumed more protein relative to the RDA than girls
(P ` 0.05). Young adolescents consumed especially large
amounts of protein. The gap between rural and urban
adolescents had declined by 1993, but high-income adoles-
cents were found to consume more protein than low- and
middle-income adolescents in 1993 (P ` 0.05). Very few
adolescents (about 1%) consumed protein below 2a3 of the
American RDA during 1991 ± 1993. However, unlike the
American diet, plant food is a major component of the
Chinese daily diet and an important source of protein.
Table 5 shows the distribution of population by the
percentages of energy derived from total fat, saturated fat
and cholesterol consumption by residence and income.
Marked difference by residence and income is suggested.
About 23% of the participants derived more than 30% of
their dietary energy (b 30 en%) from fat, and 12% derived
over 10% of their energy from saturated fat in 1991; these
proportions rose to 27% and 16% respectively, by 1993. In
1991, among rural adolescents, the percentage of those who
had a high-fat diet (b 30 en%) rose from 8% to 29% for
low-income to high-income groups; 6% to 14% for high-
saturated fat intake (b 10 en%); and 4% to 18% for high
cholesterol consumption (b 300 mg). A similar trend was
shown among urban adolescents. In the high-income group,
56%, 28%, and 37% of the subjects had a high-fat, high-
saturated fat, or high-cholesterol diet, respectively. By
1993, in general, these percentages increased relative to
1991, especially in rural areas. In high-income groups, 39%
of rural adolescents and 60% of urban adolescents had a
high-fat diet.

Our principal ®nding is that Chinese adolescents experi-
enced an improvement of diet and nutritional status. Chi-
nese adolescents had relatively adequate food intakes, on
average, with energy and protein intakes higher than the
American RDA; the prevalence of stunting declined from
23% in 1991 to 19% by 1993; but under-nutrition is still the
most important nutritional problem even though the pre-
valence (13%) is relatively low. However, overweight or
obesity is emerging as a problem associated with young,
high-income, and urban adolescents, but the prevalence
(4%) is quite low compared with developed countries.
One of the dif®culties in studying adolescent nutrition
relates to the selection of standards. The indicators used to
de®ne overweight or obese adolescents have not been
standardized. Various measures recommended include
weight-for-age, weight stature indices, skinfold thicknesses,
body circumference, and body mass index (BMI). BMI has
been recommended as the best standard for measuring
overweight among adolescents and it is widely used by
most researchers (Himes & Dietz, 1994; Poskitt, 1995;
WHO Expert Committee, 1995; Power et al, 1997). Even
though it is argued that BMI does not distinguish fat body
mass and lean body mass, the recommended NHCSa
WHO gender-speci®c BMI-for-age cut-offs (WHO Expert
Committee, 1995) were used as standards in our study based
on the following additional considerations. (a) BMI has
been found signi®cantly correlated with body fatness in
adolescents (Deurenberg et al, 1991; Goulding et al, 1996;
Meisler & St Jeor, 1996). (b) For adolescents, BMI may be
more nutritionally than genetically related, and therefore the
choice of local versus international standards for BMI is not
so crucial as it is for weight and height (Rolland-Cachera,
1993), although some researchers suggest that race-speci®c
standards should be used (Hammer et al, 1991; Ellis, 1997;
Ellis et al, 1997; Yanai et al, 1997). (c) Although skinfold
thickness is viewed by some researchers as the best
measurement of adiposity among adolescents (Sangi and

Nutrition and diet of Chinese adolescents
Y Wang et al

Mueller, 1991), there are many well recognized limitations
of the method (Lohman, 1981; Power et al, 1997). (d) The
advantages of using a single index throughout life are
suf®cient to support BMI as a good indicator of fatness at
all ages (Cole, 1991).
This study found that 13% of Chinese adolescents were
under-nourished, but the prevalence was as high as 18%
among younger adolescents aged 10 ± 13 years. Under-
nutrition, even moderate and mild forms, has many sig-
ni®cant adverse effects. Under-nutrition affects not only
children's and adolescents' physical and mental develop-
ment, but also their emotional stability and behavioral
development (Pollitt, 1994; Agarwal et al, 1995; Brown
& Sherman, 1995; Gorman, 1995; Grantham-McGregor,
1995; Wachs, 1995). However, there is minimal published
research on adolescents' nutritional status in developing
countries. In contrast, there is an extensive literature that
documents serious under-nutrition problems among pre-
schoolers (de Onis et al, 1993).
Few published nationally representative studies about
under-nutrition are available for Chinese adolescents. Pre-
vious studies found that, on average, 21% of Chinese
preschool children and 24% of rural preschool children
were of low weight-for-age (de Onis et al, 1993). A 5-year
monitoring project in poor rural areas in China found 24 ±
28% of 10 000 preschool children were of low weight-for-
age in the late 1980s (Chang et al, 1994). There is some
economic evidence that there may be a widening of the
income differences in China, especially between rural and
urban populations, and this might exacerbate the under-
nutrition situation we found (World Bank, 1995). Attention
needs to be focused on this problem, especially among
particular groups such as children and adolescents in poor
rural areas and urban low-income groups.
However, our ®ndings suggest that under-nutrition
among Chinese adolescents is not as serious as the problem
in most developing countries, especially those in Asia.
Only 19% of Chinese adolescents were found to be stunted
by 1993; in contrast, 47% of adolescents in Nepal (Regmi
& Adhikari, 1994), 43 ± 65% in the Philippines (Bouis et al,
1994; Roldan et al, 1994), and 32% in India (Kurz, 1996)
were found stunted. The prevalence of underweight among
Chinese adolescents (13%) is also lower than in some other
developing countries in Asia, such as India (53%) and
Nepal (36%). In contrast to other developing countries,
we ®nd that only about 1.5 times more boys were under-
nourished than girls while Kurz reported that at least twice
as many boys as girls were under-nourished in seven of the
eight studies he reviewed. Studies from India, Nepal,
Indonesia, Bangladesh, and the Philippines found that
Asian girls were at increased risk of under-nutrition and
mortality rates, which may be the result of their lesser
access to a variety of services, lower priority for food than
their male siblings, and other forms of discrimination
(Waslien & Stewart, 1994). The one-child policy might
lead to Chinese parents to provide more equitable care to
their daughters.
In our study, 4% of adolescents were found overweight
or obese, and younger (` 14 years), higher-income and
urban adolescents were most likely to be overweight. As
is well known, adolescent obesity has important health
consequences and is a major antecedent of adult obesity
(Sorensen & Sonne-Holm, 1988; Manson et al, 1990; Must
et al, 1992; Williams et al, 1992; Guo et al, 1994; Lusky et
al, 1996; Must, 1996; Srinivasan et al, 1996; Lake et al,
1997; McGill, 1997). In many industrialized countries,
prevention of obesity is a public health priority with
much of the concern focusing on children and adolescents
(Power et al, 1997). Although compared with adolescents
in the United States (over 20%) and many other industria-
lized countries (Troiano et al, 1995; Mahan & Escott-
Stump, 1996; Popkin & Udry, 1998), the prevalence is
very low, the increase of obesity among Chinese children
and adolescents should be highlighted. A few small-scale
surveys among Chinese school students indicate an
increase of the prevalence of overweight and obesity,
especially among urban adolescents. A study in Heilong-
jiang province found that 5% of urban school students were
obese in 1991, 6% in 1992, and 15% by 1993 (Liu & Yuan,
1995). Some other nonrepresentative surveys suggest that
the prevalence of overweight might have reached 6 ± 9% in
several coastal provinces in the north by the early 1990s
(Fan et al, 1995; Wang & Liu et al, 1995; Liu, 1996). The
prevalence we present is lower than these ®ndings. This
might be explained by different standards as well as the use
of weight-for-age data, and different sampling in our eight-
province urban and rural survey as compared with these
much more limited surveys, mainly conducted in higher-
income regions. In particular, failure to use BMI might lead
to considerable misclassi®cation.
The escalating obesity among children in China has
drawn increasing attention, but little attention has been
focused on adolescents. One of our previous studies shows
that the prevalence of overweight among Chinese children
increased to 10% by 1993 from 9% in 1991 based on the
CHNS data (Popkin et al, 1996). It is likely that a similar
situation will emerge in China among adolescents to match
the large increase in obesity found among younger Chinese
children (Popkin et al, 1996). Of great concern is that these
examples may suggest, with the development of China's
economy and changes of people's diet and lifestyles, that
more adolescents in China will become overweight if no
effective approaches are adopted in time.
Our ®ndings suggest an increase of dietary fat intake and
a decrease in consumption of grain and cereal products
among Chinese adolescents, particularly among the urban,
and high-income groups. We ®nd that, on average, urban
adolescents obtained 26 ± 29% of their calories from fat and
7 ± 8% from saturated fat (the recommended levels are 30%
and 10%, respectively). Furthermore, among urban adoles-
cents, 37% of he middle-income group and 60% of high-
income adolescents had a high-fat diet by 1993. Dramatic
changes in the Chinese people's diets and their nutritional
habits in urban and rural areas have been well addressed
(Popkin et al, 1993; Smith, 1993; Chen & Xu, 1996). The
long-term health impact of the changes of dietary fat intake
and grain and cereal consumption among Chinese adoles-
cents needs to be highlighted in further research.
Finally, we found marked differences between urban
and rural adolescents as well as among adolescents from
families with different income levels regarding their dietary
patterns and nutritional status, but the gap of under-nutri-
tion between urban and rural adolescents has been nar-
rowed. This may indicate short-term impacts of the
economic transition on adolescent nutrition in China. In
general, urban adolescents were of better nutritional status
as they suffered from less stunting, which marked their past
experience, and they were taller and heavier than their rural
counterparts; but they may face more problems of obesity
and other risks related to the increase of fat intake and

decrease of cereal and grain consumption. Adolescents
from high-income families suffered from fewer problems
of stunting as well as underweight, but from more over-
weight than low-income adolescents. These may suggest
that nutrition-related efforts should focus on speci®c pro-
blems among different groups.
One limitation of this analysis is that we did not adjust
for adolescents' maturational status when using the WHO-
recommended BMI-for-age cut-offs to assess overweight.
Ideally, sexual maturation should be adjusted for in study-
ing the nutritional status of adolescents (de Onis & Habicht,
1996; Power et al, 1997). However, techniques for doing
this are not well established and other studies that present
national data on adolescents have ignored sexual matura-
tion, therefore, we follow the same practice of presenting
unadjusted patterns based on age- and gender-speci®c BMI
cut-offs. A WHO Expert Committee recommended that
when population estimates of maturational status were
available, age-speci®c means or medians for anthropometry
might adjust for rates of maturation that differ from the
reference data (de Onis & Habicht, 1996). However, few
current nationally representative data on maturational
events among Chinese adolescents, particularly boys, are
available, although some data suggest that the average and
median ages at menarche among Chinese girls are later
than that for American girls, in spite of marked changes
during the past several decades and variation among girls in
different areas in China (Yie, 1991; Lin et al, 1992a; Liu,
1997). It is known that the adiposity of adolescent males
and females will increase with the onset of pubertyÐgirls
gaining more fat and boys gaining more lean tissue. There-
fore, considering the possible different maturational status
of Chinese adolescents, it could be the case that the
prevalence of overweight among our study population has
been underestimated by using the NCHSaWHO reference
without adjusting for maturity.
Adolescence is an important period for a person to form
dietary habits and lifestyle, and adolescents are more free to
accept new information. Furthermore, adolescents have the
potential to pass nutritional knowledge to their current and
future families to improve their diet and health. Therefore,
adolescence is an important target of nutrition education
efforts. Nutritional knowledge focusing on a balanced diet
of plenty of vegetables, fruits, grains, cereals, protein, and
moderate amount of fat is of great interest for adolescent
development and health in China.
In conclusion, based on our ®ndings and results from
previous research, Chinese adolescents have experienced
an improvement of diet and nutritional status, but under-
nutrition is still an important nutritional problem especially
among young and poor adolescents. More attention should
be focused on the increase of dietary fat intake and obesity,
particularly among urban and high family income groups.
Nutritional education focusing on health, diet and lifestyles
should be carried out on a broad basis in China.
