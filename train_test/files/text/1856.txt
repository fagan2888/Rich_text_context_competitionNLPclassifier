Recent studies have shown that diabetic men have a lower risk of prostate cancer and that this association may
be related to time since diagnosis. The authors examined the association between diabetes and prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) levels, controlling for potential confounders, in a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of
the US population (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001­2002). Diabetes classification was
self-reported, and undiagnosed diabetes was determined with fasting plasma glucose measurements. Controlling
for age, men with self-reported diabetes had a 21.6% lower geometric mean PSA level than men without diabetes.
The difference increased with years since diagnosis (>10 years: 27.5% lower geometric mean PSA level). Over-
weight men who had had diabetes for more than 10 years had a predicted geometric mean PSA level 40.8% lower
than that of nondiabetic, normal-weight men. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that long-term
diabetes is associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer. The mechanism of this association may involve the
regulation of PSA by androgens, although the authors are unable to confirm this assertion. Better understanding of
the determinants of PSA level is needed to make the distinction between factors affecting the PSA test's accuracy
and those altering the risk of prostate cancer.

Recent studies have suggested an association between
type 2 diabetes mellitus and lower risk of prostate cancer
(1, 2). It has been hypothesized that men with long-term
diabetes have a lower risk of prostate cancer than nondia-
betic men, and recently diagnosed men have a higher risk (3,
4). In biologic models proposed to explain this association,
researchers note the higher concentrations of insulin and
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in early diabetes and
the lower testosterone and IGF-1 levels and higher estrogen
concentrations in long-term diabetes (5, 6). Whether diabe-
tes influences levels of biomarkers such as prostate-specific
antigen (PSA), which is involved in the detection of prostate
cancer, is unknown.
Factors influencing serum PSA levels in men include age,
benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis, and body mass in-
dex (BMI) (7, 8). Still, we understand little about PSA, and
its relations with comorbid conditions remain unexplored
(9). Diabetes and PSA screening are prevalent among men
aged 50 years or older, and no doubt many men this age with
diabetes undergo PSA testing (10, 11). In this analysis, we
examined whether PSA concentrations varied by diabetes
status and duration of diabetes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Survey
The 2001­2002 National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) was weighted to provide a nationally
representative sample of the noninstitutionalized, civilian
US population (12). In 2001­2002, participation rates for
the NHANES interview and medical examination were 83.9
percent and 79.7 percent, respectively. An institutional re-
view board approved the survey. Participants provided in-
formed consent for PSA testing.
PSA assays were conducted on serum samples taken from
all men aged 40 years who did not meet any of the PSA
testing exclusion criteria, including current prostatitis or di-
agnosis of prostate cancer (n ¼ 1,308) (13). PSA was mea-
sured using the Hybritech assay (Hybritech, Inc., San Diego,
California) in the Beckman immunoassay system (Beckman
Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, California).
Sample adults were asked, ``Have you ever been told by
a doctor or health professional that you have diabetes or sugar
diabetes?'' Men answering affirmatively (n ¼ 173) were clas-
sified as having diabetes. We calculated time since diagnosis
(in years) by subtracting age at diagnosis from current age,
producing categories of 0­5, 6­10, and >10 years (3). Men
who reported being diabetic were also asked whether they
were currently taking ``diabetic pills to lower blood sugar.''
A subset of our 1,308 participants were instructed to fast
before the medical examination (n ¼ 605). In NHANES,
separate weights are assigned to ensure that this fasting sam-
ple is nationally representative. Among participants not self-
classified as diabetic, we designated a fasting plasma glucose
level of 126 mg/dl as undiagnosed diabetes, and we created
separate groups for persons with fasting plasma glucose lev-
els of <100 mg/dl, 100­110 mg/dl, and 111­125 mg/dl. Self-
classified diabetic men were categorized by years since
diagnosis, as noted above. Fasting has not been shown to
affect PSA levels (14), and there was no statistically signif-
icant difference between PSA values in the fasting and non-
fasting groups (p ¼ 0.415).
Measures
We categorized participants by measured BMI (weight
(kg)/height (m)2) as normal-weight (BMI <25), overweight
(BMI 25­<30), or obese (BMI 30) (15). Persons with
a measured systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or a di-
astolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg were considered hyper-
tensive (16). We defined measured high density lipoprotein
cholesterol with a gender-specific 0.9-mmol/liter threshold
(17). Serum insulin concentrations were measured for the
men who had fasted. The QUICKI index of insulin sensitiv-
ity was calculated for men in the fasting subsample (1/[log
insulin (lU/ml) þ log glucose (mg/dl)]) (18). Ever having
been diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia was self-
reported. We categorized age by decade (40­49, 50­59, 60­
69, 70­79, and 80­85 years) in the univariate analysis but
controlled for age continuously in our multivariate models.
We categorized race/ethnicity as Mexican-American, non-
Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, or other. For all vari-
ables, responses such as ``refused'' or ``don't know'' were
considered missing data.
Statistical analyses
PSA values were natural-log-transformed to improve nor-
mality. Log PSA was used as the dependent variable for the
bivariate and linear regression analyses. In all analyses, we
used SUDAAN, version 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute,
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina), to account for the
complex sampling design. All p values (from t tests) were
two-sided. We analyzed log-transformed PSA values, and
accordingly we present geometric means in table 1. We con-
trolled for age when presenting results because of the known
association between PSA and age. Variables for the catego-
ries of years since diagnosis of diabetes were coded as sep-
arate terms in the multivariate analyses. In constructing the
multiple linear regression model (table 2), we first assessed
variables using a series of models containing only the vari-
able in question, the diabetes terms, including time since
diagnosis, and an interaction term for the interaction be-
tween the two. Variables that were themselves significant
predictors in the presence of the diabetes terms were in-
cluded in the multiple linear regression model, as were any
confounders that altered the predicted effect of the diabetes
terms by more than 10 percent (19). Interactions between
the diabetes terms and BMI, high density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol, race/ethnicity, blood pressure, age, and benign
prostatic hyperplasia were nonsignificant. The race/ethnic-
ity terms were included in the model because of previous
reports that showed variation in PSA levels by race/ethnic-
ity (20).
RESULTS
Geometric mean PSA levels increased with age (40­49
years: 0.75 ng/ml; 50­59 years: 0.93 ng/ml; 60­69 years:
1.11 ng/ml; 70­79 years: 1.76 ng/ml; 80­85 years: 2.15 ng/
ml). Results are shown in table 1 after controlling for age
(median age, 51 years). Both the overweight and obese
BMI groups showed lower predicted geometric mean PSA
levels than the comparison group (BMI <25) (table 1). No
significant differences in predicted geometric mean PSA lev-
els were seen by race/ethnicity, blood pressure, high density
lipoprotein cholesterol, or past diagnosis of benign prostatic
hyperplasia. The predicted geometric mean PSA value was
lower in the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic group (p <
0.001) and was lowest in men who had been diagnosed with
diabetes more than 10 years previously. The trend for de-
creased PSA by diabetes status (beginning with nondiabetic
men and ending with men diagnosed more than 10 years
previously) was statistically significant (p ¼ 0.001). Diabetic
men taking medication to control blood glucose levels had
lower PSA levels than nondiabetic men, but in a comparison
with diabetic men not taking medication, the p value was not
statistically significant (p ¼ 0.073).
We examined the association between PSA and diabetes
covariates in a fasting subsample of our study population,
adjusting for age as in table 1. There was no association

between PSA and fasting insulin levels (p ¼ 0.182; data not
shown), as well as no change in predicted geometric mean
PSA by category of fasting plasma glucose among the non-
diabetic men (p ¼ 0.800; data not shown). Additionally,
there was no association between the QUICKI index of in-
sulin sensitivity and PSA (p ¼ 0.122; data not shown). The
predicted geometric mean PSA for self-reporting diabetic
men was lower than that of self-reporting nondiabetic men
(n ¼ 540) (0.62 ng/ml vs. 0.88 ng/ml; p ¼ 0.012). There was
no statistically significant difference between self-reporting
diabetic men (n ¼ 65) and men with undiagnosed diabetes
(n ¼ 45) (0.57 ng/ml vs. 0.77 ng/ml; p ¼ 0.146). When we
compared the group of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetic
men (n ¼ 109) with those self-reporting nondiabetic men
who had a fasting plasma glucose level less than 100 mg/dl
(n ¼ 250), there was no statistically significant difference
(0.70 ng/ml vs. 0.86 ng/ml; p ¼ 0.120). In contrast to the
results in the larger sample, the lowest predicted geometric
mean PSA level in the fasting subsample was for persons
diagnosed with diabetes within the previous 5 years (n ¼ 28)

(0.56 ng/ml; in comparison with nondiabetic men with a
fasting plasma glucose level less than 100 mg/dl, p ¼
0.019).
In the multiple linear regression model, neither BMI nor
race/ethnicity confounded the association between the di-
abetes terms and PSA (table 2). We used the model to ex-
amine the joint associations of BMI and diabetes with PSA.
The predicted geometric mean PSA for all 51-year-old non-
diabetic men with a BMI less than 25 was 1.03 ng/ml--
significantly higher than the value for their same-age peers
with diabetes of more than 10 years' duration who had a
BMI greater than or equal to 25 (0.61 ng/ml, a 40.8 percent
reduction; p ¼ 0.001).
DISCUSSION
Diabetes and an overweight BMI are independently asso-
ciated with lower geometric mean PSA levels. Together they
are associated with as much as a 40.8 percent lower pre-
dicted geometric mean PSA level relative to nondiabetic,
normal-weight men. Diabetic men have lower androgen lev-
els than nondiabetic men, and this may partially explain
their lower PSA levels (6). Our finding of a significant down-
ward trend of PSA (from no diabetes to diabetes of more
than 10 years' duration) is consistent with a possible asso-
ciation between progressing diabetes and decreasing testos-
terone concentrations, which may lower the risk of prostate
cancer (21). Despite the existence of functional androgen-
responsive elements upstream of the PSA gene promoter,
previous investigations have not shown an association be-
tween serum testosterone and PSA levels (22). However,
PSA may be associated with testosterone in men with sub-
normal levels of the sex hormone (23), as is the case with
diabetic men. Diabetes might also alter PSA values through
impaired kidney function (24) or as a consequence of di-
abetes medication use. Metformin, a hypoglycemic agent,
has been shown to decrease testosterone levels in nondia-
betic men but not in diabetic men (25, 26). In our study,
diabetic men taking medication appeared to have lower PSA
levels than diabetic men not taking medication, but our
small sample size limited our statistical power to detect a
difference. This association can be examined more appro-
priately with additional data.
In diabetes, IGF-1 levels increase during hyperinsulinemia
and decrease as insulin production drops (27). Previous stud-
ies have found a peak in prostate cancer risk during early
diabetes, and a recent study (28) found a modest positive
association between serum PSA and serum IGF-1 that was
proposed to be due to IGF-1-induced benign prostatic

hyperplasia in older men (3, 4). We did not observe a positive
association between insulin and PSA, even after restricting
the analysis to men aged 60 years or older. Insulin levels may
be a poor proxy for long-term IGF-1, however, and this mis-
classification may have weakened our chances of finding
an association. We also found no association between PSA
and the QUICKI measure of insulin resistance (p ¼ 0.121).
However, interpreting these results is made difficult by our
inability to control for serum testosterone, which is asso-
ciated inversely with insulin, fasting glucose, and insulin re-
sistance (29).
It is unclear whether the lowered PSA levels in diabetic
men accurately reflect a decreased risk of prostate cancer in
the diabetic population or whether their lower PSA levels
result in a reduced likelihood of receiving a diagnostic
workup for detection of asymptomatic prostate cancers, as
has been suggested for obese men (7). If the latter were true,
diabetic men might well be diagnosed with later-stage tumors
and have poorer treatment outcomes, and overweight dia-
betic men would have later-stage tumors than normal-weight
diabetic men. However, data from CaPSURE (Cancer of the
Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor), a registry of
men with prostate cancer, have not shown later stages at pre-
sentation or worse clinical outcomes for diabetic men (30).
The principal limitation of this analysis is the small num-
ber of men self-reporting with diabetes. These men had a
lower PSA levelthan men without diabetes in both our fasting
(n ¼ 605) and nonfasting (n ¼ 703) subsamples, although
only in the fasting subsample did the difference attain statis-
tical significance (fasting: p ¼ 0.012; nonfasting: p ¼ 0.078).
Examining the trend in PSA by duration of diabetes in the two
subsamples revealed two different trends. We do not know
whether these discrepancies arise from less stable estimates
in the separated groups, whether fasting itself influences the
relation between PSA and diabetes, or whether there are other
differences between the groups that may explain these re-
sults. Future data from NHANES surveys will enable inves-
tigators to make more stable estimates of geometric mean
PSA levels among diabetic men.
An additional limitation of this study is that the number of
participants with undiagnosed cancer was unknown, and
thus we do not know whether differences in PSA were due
to undiagnosed prostate cancer in the diabetic and nondia-
betic groups. Furthermore, without clinical data, we cannot
be sure that these differences in PSA result in missed biopsy
opportunities, nor can we recommend alternate biopsy
thresholds for diabetic men. A third limitation is that self-
reported measures of diabetes status have been shown to be
highly specific but only 66 percent sensitive (31). We ad-
dressed this concern by analyzing the fasting subsample,
although there may have been additional diabetic men in
the NHANES who reported being nondiabetic. This mis-
classification would have biased our results towards the null.
Although we were unable to separate men with type 1 di-
abetes from men with type 2 diabetes in our study, excluding
the six persons who were diagnosed before age 30 years and
were currently taking insulin did not significantly alter our
results. In another potential source of misclassification, par-
ticipants were given the option to report having ``borderline''
diabetes. We categorized these men as nondiabetic (n ¼ 29).
The analysis was repeated with these men categorized as
diabetic; no substantial changes were noted.
Some investigators have recommended age- and race-
specific thresholds for prostate cancer detection based on
population-level differences (20). While this study was un-
able to demonstrate that modified PSA thresholds for dia-
betic men would result in greater accuracy, future studies
should investigate whether diabetes status, duration of di-
abetes, and obesity should be considered when interpreting
a PSA test result. Better understanding of the determinants
of PSA levels is needed to make the distinction between
factors affecting the test's accuracy and those altering the
risk of prostate cancer.
