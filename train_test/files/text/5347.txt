Introduction
Adolescence has been identified as a critical life stage in the
development of mental health problems (Patel, Flisher,
Hetrick, & McGorry, 2007), as mental disorders commonly
have their first onset during this stage of life (Kessler et al.,
2005). Increasing autonomy and individuation from the fam-
ily are defining features of adolescence as a developmental
period (Allison & Sabatelli, 1988), resulting in reduced
dependence on the family unit. Yet, research shows that ado-
lescents continue to depend on parents as a primary source of
support and advice throughout this developmental phase
(Steinberg, 2001). It is evident that pre-adolescent children
often rely upon a significant adult (usually a parent) to facili-
tate service use should they experience a mental health prob-
lem (Kazdin, Holland, & Crowley, 1997). However, this
reliance is likely to reduce as a young person matures into
adolescence. Nonetheless, family and parent factors (herein
referred to in combination as family factors for simplicity)
are still likely to be influential in this process, although
which of these factors and how has yet to be established.
A demonstrated gap between mental health service need
and service use has resulted in a body of literature examining
what factors in addition to need influence whether a young
person receives mental health services (Logan & King, 2001;
Rickwood, Deane, & Wilson, 2007). Proposed models of the
process of accessing mental health services for a child and/or
adolescent derive from existing models of adult help-
seeking, adapted to incorporate features of the family
(Costello, Pescosolido, Angold, & Burns, 1998; Logan &
King, 2001; Srebnik, Cauce, & Baydar, 1996). Although
quite diverse and often somewhat complex, these models iden-
tify a number of common factors. To varying degrees, they
derive from the behavioral model of health service use devel-
oped by Andersen and colleagues (Andersen, 1995; Andersen
& Newman, 1973). The Andersen model classifies individual
determinants of service use into three broad categories:

Factors Associated With Service Use for
Young Adolescents With Mental Health
Problems: Findings From an Australian
Longitudinal Study
Siobhan M. Ryan1, John W. Toumbourou1,
and Anthony F. Jorm2
Abstract
The objective of the study wasto identify factors associated with use of services for adolescent mental health problems in
an Australian community-based sample. Logistic regression analysis was conducted on data collected from 636 parents and
their adolescent child to identify individual and family variables predicting parent report of service use for mental health
problems in the adolescent 12 months later. The services most reported by parents to have been accessed were school-
based ones. Multivariate analysis found that the following were associated with service use 12 months later: the adolescent
being female, parent report of peer problems and hyperactivity, single-parent household, the parent being Australian born,
and prior service use by the adolescent. Parental overcontrol was associated with reduced likelihood of service use at follow-
up. No association was found between service use at follow-up and parent gender, socioeconomic status, number of siblings,
parent psychopathology, family social connectedness, and prior service use by the parent. No association was also found for
family environment factors, parental attachment, or for the adolescent's emotional competence or use of social support. The
results indicate that families provide a potential target for interventions aimed at increasing use of professional services for
adolescent mental health problems.

need-related, predisposing, or enabling (or inhibiting) factors
(Andersen, 1995; Andersen & Newman, 1973).
Figure 1 provides a visual representation of some of the
factors common to the three identified models of profes-
sional service use for mental health problems in young peo-
ple (Costello et al., 1998; Logan & King, 2001; Srebnik et
al., 1996), organized according to Andersen's model.
Examination of the influence of these identified factors has
yet to be rigorously conducted with a sample restricted to
adolescents, although a number of studies have used samples
that included both children and adolescents (e.g., Burns
et al., 2004; Ford, Hamilton, Meltzer, & Goodman, 2008).
Furthermore, a number of existing studies have not con-
trolled for the young person's mental health symptoms in
examining the influence of predictors on youth service use
(e.g., Villagrana, 2010). As many of these variables are
known risk factors for the development of mental health
problems in young people (Fergusson, Horwood, & Lynskey,
1994; Hoeve et al., 2009), results may be confounded by the
indirect influence that these factors have on the development
of the problems for which help is being sought.
There is some existing Australian research investigating
predictors of service use for adolescent mental health prob-
lems (Fallon & Bowles, 2001; Lyneham & Rapee, 2007;
Sawyer, Miller-Lewis, & Clark, 2007); however, these stud-
ies have a number of limitations, such as investigation of
only a small number of predictors (Lyneham & Rapee, 2007;
Sawyer et al., 2007), and investigation of help-seeking for a
range of problems rather than mental health problems spe-
cifically (Fallon & Bowles, 2001). A significant portion of
this literature has also assessed help-seeking intentions of
young people as the outcome variable (Rickwood, Deane,
Wilson, & Ciarrochi, 2005), which is only weakly correlated
with actual help-seeking behavior (Wilson & Deane, 2005).
Need-Related Variables Included in Models of
Service Use for a Young Person
Models of service use for young people emphasize the
importance of the parents' perception of need in this process
(Costello et al., 1998; Logan & King, 2001; Srebnik et al.,
1996). Parent perception of need is very important in young
children because they are unlikely to have an understanding
of what emotional or behavioral symptoms may possibly
benefit from professional intervention, or knowledge of pro-
fessional services appropriate and/or available (Costello et
al., 1998; Srebnik et al., 1996). Adolescents, however, may
have some understanding relating to mental health. The
degree to which parents'perception of need prevails over the
perception of the adolescents in influencing the professional
help-seeking process for the adolescent has yet to be clearly
established (Costello et al., 1998). Parents potentially could
be the initiator of help-seeking from professional services
once they perceive a need in their adolescent child, or they
may be influential in encouraging the adolescent to seek help
independently (Logan & King, 2001). The presence of iden-
tifiable antecedents to psychological distress, such as nega-
tive life events, also has the potential to generate perception
of need in either the adolescent or other family members.
Predisposing Factors Included in Models of
Service Use for a Young Person
Sociodemographic factors.In addition to sociodemographic
characteristics of the young person such as age and sex, mod-
els of service use for young people also include socioeco-
nomic characteristics of the family such as ethnic background
and income. Adolescent girls have been shown to be more
willing to access professional services for mental health
problems than adolescent boys (Rickwood et al., 2005).
However, once the presence of mental health symptoms has
been controlled for, an effect for the sex of a young person on
mental health service use has not been demonstrated (Angold
et al., 1998; Costello et al., 1998). Sociodemographic charac-
teristics of the family, such as the parents' income and edu-
cation, are identified by the models proposed by Costello
et al. (1998) and Srebnik et al. (1996) in the process of
accessing help for children and adolescents. Logan and
King's (2001) model identifies the family's instrumental
resources (e.g., money, time, available transport) as influen-
tial in parent facilitation of service use for adolescent mental
health problems. Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been
shown to be associated with service use in other countries,
once mental health symptoms of the young person were

controlled for (Feehan, Stanton, McGee, & Silva, 1990;
Zahner & Daskalakis, 1997). An Australian study, however,
failed to find a significant association between parent educa-
tional achievement or household income and use of services
for adolescent mental health problems (Sawyer et al., 2007).
Being from an ethnic minority group has been identified
as a potential barrier to use of professional services by young
people (Rickwood et al., 2007), and has been shown to pre-
dict lower use of services for young people in a number of
countries. Studies from the United States have shown that
being from an ethnic minority is associated with reduced use
of mental health services for young people (Zahner &
Daskalakis, 1997; Zimmerman, 2005), although this associa-
tion has not always been demonstrated (Cohen & Hesselbart,
1993; Teagle, 2002). One study from the United Kingdom
also found that ethnicity was associated with service use for
young people (Ford et al., 2008), and two studies from the
Netherlands also failed to find an effect for ethnicity (Douma,
Dekker, Ruiter, Verhulst, & Koot, 2006; Verhulst & van der
Ende, 1997). To our knowledge, no studies have investigated
whether ethnic background is associated with service use for
an adolescent in an Australian community-based sample
while controlling for mental health symptoms.
Family illness variables.The models proposed by Costello et
al. (1998) and Logan and King (2001) both include family
history of psychopathology, with the Logan and King model
suggesting the family history of service use operates inde-
pendently of family history of psychopathology. Srebnik et
al. (1996) also include parent psychopathology, but differ in
specifying it as need-related, in that its influence is exerted
through the parents' perception of the young person's behav-
ior as problematic. Indeed, the presence of mental health
symptoms in a parent has been shown to predict service use
for a young person (Feehan et al., 1990; Mojtabai & Olfson,
2008), as has a family history of use of mental health ser-
vices (Zimmerman, 2005). These associations, however,
have not been consistently demonstrated once mental health
symptoms in the young person are controlled for (Jensen,
Bloedau, & Davis, 1990; Teagle, 2002).
Social structure variables.Predisposing variables relating to
social structure can be further broken down to those within
the family and those relating to the social networks within
which the family is embedded (Costello et al., 1998). A fam-
ily's social structure can influence the help-seeking process
through the availability of social supports as well as through
the transmission of social norms. Family size and structure
are included in the models by Costello et al. (1998) and Sreb-
nik et al. (1996). Structural features of the family shown to
increase the likelihood of service use for a young person
include being from a single-parent household (Ford et al.,
2008; Zahner & Daskalakis, 1997), and the young person
having fewer siblings (Ford et al., 2008; Jensen et al., 1990).
The size of a family's social network can also be identified as
a factor that could predispose the family to accessing ser-
vices for an adolescent (Costello et al., 1998).
Enabling and Inhibiting Factors Included in
Models of Service Use for a Young Person
Family environment variables. All three identified models of ser-
vice use for young people include factors relating to the family
environment or parent­child relationship; however, again they
differ in how they propose these factors exert their influence.
Logan and King (2001) and Srebnik et al. (1996) both catego-
rize factors of environment of the family or parent­child rela-
tionship quality as need variables, in that they impact a parent's
ability to recognize when the young person is experiencing a
problem. Alternately, the model proposed by Costello et al.
(1998) categorizes these characteristics of the family as enabling
variables, because a function of the family unit is to provide
social and instrumental support to its members. This approach is
more in line with Andersen's original model, which views
social relationships as enabling resources (Andersen, 1995). As
there is no established guideline regarding what problems expe-
rienced by an adolescent are best managed within the family
and which would benefit from professional help, these decisions
are guided by family norms (Costello et al., 1998; Srebnik et al.,
1996). Existing studies investigating the influence of family
environment and parent­child relationship quality on service
use have produced conflicting results (Ezpeleta et al., 2002;
Ford et al., 2008; Zwaanswijk, Van der Ende, Verhaak, Bens-
ing, & Verhulst, 2005).
Coping style of the young person. The model by Costello et al.
(1998) includes the coping style of both the young person
and the parent as influential in the help-seeking process.
Australian research focused on ascertaining barriers and
enablers to adolescent help-seeking has identified the adoles-
cent's emotional and social competence as important in this
process (Rickwood et al., 2005). Emotional competence
refers to an individual's ability to recognize and describe
emotions in themselves and others, as well as their capacity
to understand emotions and manage them effectively
(Salovey & Mayer, 1989). Low emotional competence has
been shown to be associated with reduced willingness to
seek help from professional sources for emotional problems
(Ciarrochi, Wilson, Deane, & Rickwood, 2003). This asso-
ciation was found by another study to be mediated by the
adolescent's level of social support (Ciarrochi, Deane, Wil-
son, & Rickwood, 2002), which has been shown previously
to be associated with help-seeking by adolescents for emo-
tional problems (Rickwood & Braithwaite, 1994). Therefore,
in addition to the availability of social resources as indicated
by the social structure, an adolescent's capacity to recognize
when use of social supports may be beneficial, as well as the
adolescent's capacity to use these supports appropriately,
may potentially enable or inhibit use of professional services
for mental health problems.

Summary
In summary, a large number of family factors are identified
as influential by models of service use for a young person for
mental health problems. However, whether these factors play
a role in service use for adolescents specifically has yet to be
established. Furthermore, very little research has been con-
ducted using an Australian sample, in which characteristics
of the mental health care system differ from those in other
countries. The current study seeks to address these gaps in
the existing literature by evaluating family and individual
factors identified by models of service use for young people
in an Australian community-based longitudinal study of
adolescents.
Based on existing evidence, as well as proposed models
of service use for young people, it was hypothesized that ser-
vice use would be predicted by the adolescent being female,
parent report of mental health problems in the adolescent,
lower SES, single-parent household, the adolescent having
fewer siblings, being from an ethnic minority, parent psycho-
pathology, adolescent use of social supports, and previous
service use by family members. As current evidence regard-
ing the association between factors relating to the family
environment and service use is contradictory, and investiga-
tion of the impact of the family's level of social support on
service use is preliminary (Bussing et al., 2003), examination
of the impact of these factors on service use at follow-up by
the current study was exploratory.
Method
Data used for the current study was collected as part of a
longitudinal evaluation of a school-based intervention
(Australian Clinical Trial Registry Number
012606000399594). The Resilient Families Intervention
(RFI) was designed to support young adolescents and fami-
lies to promote the young person's psychological well-being
during his or her high school years. More detailed descrip-
tion of this program and the evaluation study can be found
elsewhere (Toumbourou, Gregg, Shortt, Hutchinson, &
Slaviero, 2013). Briefly, 39 schools in Melbourne Victoria
were approached to participate, 24 of which agreed.
Participating schools were randomized into either the inter-
vention or control group. All students in Year 7 in 2004 were
invited to participate in the study, with new students joining
this cohort in Year 8 in 2005 also invited to participate at
Wave 2. The adolescents completed surveys in class time.
Parents and carers (hereafter referred to in combination as
"parents") were also invited to participate via a mail-out sur-
vey. Ethical approval was obtained from the University of
Melbourne's Human Research Ethics Committee, as well as
from relevant education bodies. Parents gave written consent
for their adolescent and themselves and adolescents provided
written consent for each time point that data were collected.
Participants were followed up at Wave 2 (Year 8, 2005),
approximately 1 year after Wave 1. Further waves of data
were collected for the initial RFI evaluation, but were not
analyzed for the current study.
Participants
Of the 4,404 adolescents eligible to participate in the study,
2,128 completed both Waves 1 and 2 surveys. Completed
surveys for both waves were returned by 1,160 parents. Data
analyzed for the current study were from a subgroup of 636
parent­child dyads for whom complete data were available
at both Waves 1 and 2 of the study. The average age of the
adolescents was 12.3 years, and 54.25% of the adolescent
participants were female. Further descriptive statistics on the
sample can be seen in supplemental file 1a.
Questionnaires
Separate survey packages were provided to parents and ado-
lescents who were similar for the two waves of the current
study. The parent and adolescent survey packages included
questions regarding demographics, the adolescent's emo-
tional and behavioral problems, and a range of parenting and
family environment variables. Adolescents also responded to
questions relating to a range of individual competencies
identified in existing literature as associated with use of ser-
vices for mental health problems. An overview of included
scales can be seen in supplemental file 1a.
The outcome variable for the current study was parent
response at Wave 2 to the question: "In the last 12 months,
has your Year 8 adolescent received professional assistance
for any emotional or behavioral problems (e.g., problems
with attention, anger, fears, worries, sadness)?" A follow-up
open-ended question was asked to parents responding "yes"
to this first question: "If yes, please describe." Predictor vari-
ables were drawn from Wave 1 data from both parents and
adolescents.
Demographic information gathered from parents included
their gender, age, and relationship to the child (parent or
carer). Parents also provided information about the structure
of the household (i.e., whether both parents of the adolescent
lived in the house, or whether the family was a step-family,
single-parent family, or other), the annual household income,
the highest level of education of the parent and any partner,
and whether or not they were born in Australia as an indica-
tor of ethnicity. Although indigenous status as an additional
indicator of cultural background was assessed in the survey,
too few participants identified either themselves or a family
member as being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander
descent to allow for meaningful comparisons to be made
(Toumbourou et al., 2013). Demographic information gath-
ered from adolescents included their gender, age, and the
number of siblings they have.
Emotional and behavioral problems in the adolescent
were reported by parents on the Strengths and Difficulties
Ryan et al. 5
Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 2001; Zimmerman, 2005).
The Emotional Symptoms, Conduct Problems, Hyperactivity,
and Peer Problems subscales were included in the current
study. The adolescents completed the Conduct Problems
subscale of the self-report version of the SDQ as a measure
of behavioral problems, and the Center for Epidemiologic
Studies­Depression scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977), as an
indicator of emotional problems. The adolescents also
responded to the question, "Have you been bullied recently
(teased or called names, had rumors spread about you, been
deliberately left out of things, threatened physically, or actu-
ally hurt)?" on a 4-point scale as an indicator of the degree to
which they had recently been bullied. Negative life events
were assessed by adolescents reporting whether or not they
had experienced 1 of 12 adverse events in the previous 6
months (see supplemental file 1b for a summary).
The adolescent's perception of family conflict and paren-
tal attachment were assessed with scales drawn from the
Communities That Care (CTC) survey, which has been vali-
dated previously (Arthur, Hawkins, Pollard, Catalano, &
Baglioni, 2002; Glaser, Horn, Arthur, Hawkins, & Catalano,
2005). Parental attachment combined the two subscales of
Attachment to Mother and Attachment to Father for the cur-
rent analysis. Parental overcontrol measured with a scale
developed for the RFI adapted from the Parental Bonding
Instrument (Parker, Tupling, & Brown, 1979), assessing the
degree to which the adolescent felt that his or her parents
exert excessive psychological and behavioral control over
them (see supplemental file 1b).
Adolescent emotional competence and use of social sup-
ports were assessed with scales developed for the RFI, which
drew items from existing scales. The emotional competence
assessed the degree to which the adolescent is able to effec-
tively manage negative emotions, with items drawn from the
Self-Efficacy Questionnaire for Children (Muris, 2001) and
the emotional control scale of the CTC. The Social Support
Scale was made up of items from the "Seeking Social
Support" subscale of the Self-Report Coping Strategies sub-
scale, with one item omitted (Kochenderfer-Ladd & Skinner,
2002). This scale measured the degree to which the adoles-
cent used seeking social support as a strategy for coping with
problems (see supplemental file 1b for descriptions of these
two scales).
Parent report of the family environment was measured
with the Cohesion and Conflict subscales of the Family
Environment Scale­Third Edition (FES-III; Moos & Moos,
2002). The FES-III is a measure of the socio-environmental
characteristics of a family, with the Cohesion subscale
assessing the degree of support, commitment, and help fam-
ily members provide to one another, and the Conflict sub-
scale assessing the amount of expressed anger or conflict
within the family. Parents also completed a shortened ver-
sion of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS;
Lovibond & Lovibond, 1996) adapted for the RFI study as a
measure of mental health symptoms in the parent. Parents
were also asked "If in the last 12 months have either you (or
your spouse/partner) sought professional assistance for any
emotional problems (e.g., anxiety, depression, anger) or
problems in your relationships (marital relationship, family
relationships)?" to assess prior service use by a parent.
Adolescent and parent perception of the family's level of
social connectedness were measured with scales developed
for the RFI that assessed the degree to which the family is
involved with community groups outside of the family (see
supplemental file 1b).
Statistical Analysis
Logistic regression was used to examine the association
between adolescent-and parent-reported predictor variables
at Wave 1 and parent report of professional service use for
the young person's emotional and/or behavioral problems in
the past 12 months at Wave 2. Univariate analysis was con-
ducted for all predictor variables, then multivariate analysis
was conducted with all predictor variables run in the model
simultaneously. Odds ratios and confidence intervals were
generated to provide comparison of relative effects, with
interquartile odds ratios calculated for continuous predictor
variables to allow for comparison with categorical variables.
Interquartile odds ratios provide an estimate of the relative
likelihood of those upper and lower quartiles of the distribu-
tion of continuous variables, thereby compensating for the
scale-dependent characteristic of the statistic (Mackinnon,
1992).
Parent report of household income and education level
were combined to generate a single variable of SES for anal-
ysis. This variable was an average of standardized scores for
parent and spousal education and four levels of household
income. The household structure variable was also dichoto-
mized to parent­parent versus "other" for analysis. Because
two parents returned surveys for 54 of the adolescents, a
multiple regression was run adjusting for clustering at the
family level to control for multiple responders. This analysis
adjusted for family clustering produced findings that
reflected those of the model unadjusted for family clustering.
Results described here are from the unadjusted analysis.
Statistical analysis was conducted using STATA version 11.
Results
In all, 59 of the 636 parents in the sample reported accessing
services for their adolescent's emotional or behavioral prob-
lems at Wave 2. Of this number, 58 gave an answer to the
follow-up question asking for details, with responses describ-
ing the source of help accessed, giving a brief description of
the problems the adolescent was experiencing, or both. Two
parents reported accessing more than one source of help, and
13 described more than one type of problem for which help
was accessed. Table 1 provides a summary of responses
given by parents.
6 SAGE Open
Bivariate correlations between all variables included in
the analysis indicated that multicollinearity was not present
in the data, and the correlation matrix for all variables can be
seen in supplemental file 2. Results from the univariate and
multivariate regressions are shown in Table 2. Hosmer­
Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests were non-significant for all
models, indicating that the models were an appropriate fit for
the data (Fagerland, Hosmer, & Bofin, 2008).
Once all predictor variables were included in the model,
factors that were significantly associated with increased use
of services for an adolescent were the adolescent being
female, parent report of hyperactivity and peer problems,
being from a single-parent family, the parent beingAustralian
born, and use of services for the adolescent in the previous
year. Adolescent report of high parental overcontrol was
associated with reduced odds of receiving services once the
influence of all other variables was taken into account.
Need factors for which no significant association was
found with service use at Wave 2 in the multiple regression
model were adolescent report of depressive symptoms,
behavioral problems, being bullied and negative life events,
and parent report of emotional and conduct in the adolescent.
No association was found between service use at follow-up
and predisposing factors of sex of the parent, SES, number of
siblings, parent psychopathology (DASS score), family
social connectedness, and previous use of mental health ser-
vices by the parent. No association was found for enabling
factors of the family environment, adolescent attachment to
parents and family conflict, the adolescent's emotional com-
petence or use of social support, parent report of family con-
flict and cohesion, parent and adolescent report of social
connectedness, parent use of services in the previous year,
SES, and exposure to the RFI.
Discussion
Results from the current study demonstrate that, of a large
number of predisposing, enabling, and need-related variables
investigated, the adolescent being female, parent report of
hyperactivity, and peer problems, prior service use by the
adolescent, being from a single-parent family, and the parent
being Australian born predicted service use at 12-month fol-
low-up. Adolescent report of parent overcontrol was also
found to be associated with a reduced likelihood that the ado-
lescent would receive services once other variables were
controlled for. School-based services were the predominant

source of professional help reported by parents as accessed,
suggesting these services may be particularly important in
both addressing problems in young adolescents, and as a
potential referral source for when problems require more
specialized services.
That parent report of hyperactivity problems in the ado-
lescent was found to predict service use over and above the
presence of other mental health symptoms suggests that the
parent's perception of clearly observable and potentially dis-
ruptive problems is particularly important for professional
service use. This finding supports those of previous studies
that have found that the impact of a young person's mental
health problems on the parent is an important predictor of
service use (Angold et al., 1998; Ford et al., 2008). The asso-
ciation found here between the parent's report of peer prob-
lems and use of services indicates that parents may be more
likely to recognize when their adolescent child is experienc-
ing mental health problems when there is an identifiable
antecedent to them. This influence, however, may be more
prominent in a school setting, considering that school-based
services were the predominant professional source of help.
That adolescent report of bullying does not retain signifi-
cance in the full model also suggests that parents continue to
have the predominant influence in the decision to access help
for an adolescent of this age.
Of predisposing variables examined in this study, the ado-
lescent being female, being from a single-parent family,
being from the dominant ethnic group, and previous service
use by the adolescent were found to increase the likelihood
of professional help-seeking. The finding of greater service
use by females is consistent with previous research showing
that they are more willing to seek help and may also indicate
that parents are more predisposed to seek services for them.
Although the association between being from a single-
parent family and service use for young people is relatively
established (Verhulst & van der Ende, 1997; Zahner &
Daskalakis, 1997; Zimmerman, 2005), the mechanisms
underpinning this association have yet to be examined
empirically. One hypothesis is that when there are less social
resources available within the family, the family is more
likely to seek out professional help. That no association was
found between the level of social connectivity of the family
and service use suggests that this association is unlikely to be
mediated by the availability of informal help sources to the
family. Furthermore, as measures of the adolescent's social
competence and use of social support for coping were not
related to service use, it is likely that service use by single-
parent families is driven more by the parent than the
adolescent.
Being from an ethnic minority is an established barrier to
service use; however, this is the first study to our knowledge
to demonstrate that this in an Australian community-based
sample using service use behavior as an outcome measure.
Research from the United States suggests that the influence of
culture operates through beliefs about mental health (Lau &
Takeuchi, 2001); however, other factors that may contribute
to this association include English language difficulties, lack
of awareness of services available, and a perception that ser-
vices are unlikely to be able to accommodate diverse cultural
beliefs and practices. Interestingly, only the adolescent's his-
tory of service use, and not the parent's, predicted profes-
sional help-seeking, suggesting that knowledge of adult
mental health problems and services does not necessarily
generalize to understanding about adolescent mental health
problems and appropriate help sources. This result, however,
may be a reflection of the substantial use of school-based
sources reported in the current study.
The only enabling variable identified as associated with
service use was the adolescent's report of parent overcontrol.
Although this factor has been shown to be associated with an
increased risk for adolescent emotional problems (McLeod,
Weisz, & Wood, 2007), this is the first known study finding
that this variable is a predictor of lower service use. This
finding identifies parental overcontrol as an important focus
for early intervention and prevention efforts for mental health
problems in adolescents. It also highlights the importance of
developing a clear representation of how an overcontrolling,
or more importantly an "appropriately controlling," parent-
ing style is operationalized to inform such interventions.
The current study has a number of limitations that should
be acknowledged. First, reliance solely upon parent report of
service use means that any service use initiated by the ado-
lescent or other referral source that may have occurred with-
out the parent's knowledge is not counted. The study would
have also benefited from a more detailed measure of service
use, including systematic assessment of types of help
accessed for the adolescent's problems, as well as the types
of problems for which help was sought. Another limitation is
the lack of uniformity in parent-and adolescent-reported
measures. Validated, parallel measurement tools designed
for multiple informants of family environment and parenting
factors, as well as for the adolescent's mental health symp-
toms would have improved the quality of this study.
Furthermore, although the current study used a community-
based sample, the small proportion of eligible parents who
participated in the study limits generalizability. Despite these
limitations, the findings improve understanding of profes-
sional help-seeking in the Australian context, by using a
community sample and a diverse range of predictor vari-
ables. Use of a longitudinal design is also a strength of the
current study.
In conclusion, findings from the current study indicate
that, as proposed by existing models of service use for men-
tal health problems in young people, factors relating to the
family are important. These findings suggest that the family
is a valuable potential target for interventions aimed at
improving service use.
