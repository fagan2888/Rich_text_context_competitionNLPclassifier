Adult children are a significant source of support as
well as strain for mothers and fathers across the life
span. Indeed, ambivalence, the simultaneous experience of
positive and negative feelings, is common in the parent­
child tie due to conflicting desires for independence and
closeness (Pillemer & Suitor, 2005). More than 50% of
midlife and older parents report some ambivalence toward
their grown children (Fingerman, Hay, & Birditt, 2004;
Pillemer & Suitor, 2002). Although middle-aged and older
parents report greater ambivalence toward offspring who
have not achieved adult milestones (e.g., marriage) and
older mothers report more ambivalence regarding problem-
atic children (Fingerman, Chen, Hay, Cichy, & Lefkowitz,
2006; Pillemer, Suitor, et al., 2007), researchers have
not explicitly examined whether children's problems and
achievements help explain midlife men's and women's feel-
ings of ambivalence toward those children. Parents may feel
greater ambivalence regarding problematic children (e.g.,
trouble with the law and illness) and less successful chil-
dren (e.g., career success) due to their continuing depen-
dence and violation of adult status attainment norms
(Aldous,Klaus,&Klein,1985;Pillemer,Sechrist,Steinhour,
& Suitor, 2007). Problematic children provide less care
to parents (Cicirelli, 1983), they cause parental distress
(Greenberg & Becker, 1988; Pillemer & Suitor, 1991), they
tend to drain parents' resources (Aldous et al.), and they
are parents' least preferred support providers (Pillemer &
Suitor, 2002). In contrast, successful children (e.g., doing
well in their relationships and career) may increase
parents' well-being and provide more support to parents
(Fingerman, Miller, Birditt, & Zarit, 2009; Ryff, Lee, Essex,
& Schmutte, 1994).
Ambivalence theory provides a useful framework for un-
derstanding the complexity of the parent­child relationship
and adult children's problems and successes. Ambivalence
refers to the simultaneous experience of positive and nega-
tive sentiments about the same relationship (Luescher &
Pillemer, 1998). The present study defines ambivalence as
reporting positive and negative relationship quality regard-
ing the same child. Individuals experience ambivalence
when there are incompatible norms or expectations that
cause contradictory emotions or beliefs (Merton & Barber,
1963). Parents experience ambivalence due to competing
desires to launch their children into adulthood and to sup-
port to children in need (e.g., children with problems).
It is particularly important to identify predictors of am-
bivalence because ambivalence is associated with greater
depression, lower quality of life, and poorer health among
parents (Fingerman, Pitzer, Lefkowitz, Birditt, & Mroczek,
2008; Lowenstein, 2007; Ward, 2008). The majority of work
in this area has examined older mother's reports and often
reports of only one child. This study seeks to understand
whether middle-aged women and men differentiate among
their children in terms of their successes and problems and
whether these differentiations are associated with ambiva-
lence. This study examines (a) within-individual variations
in reports of adult children's problems, successes, and am-
bivalence among middle-aged women and men and (b) im-
plications of problems and successes for intergenerational
ambivalence among middle-aged women and men. This re-
search has practical implications because it may provide
insights into how to improve the parent­child relationship
as parents grow older and in greater need of support from
these ties.

Ambivalence theory suggests that parents experience ambivalence due to conflicting desires to help children in
need and to launch children into adulthood. This study examined parents' reports of their adult children's prob-
lems and successes and implications for ambivalence. Participants aged 40­60 years (302 men and 331 women
from different families) reported on up to 3 of their adult children (N = 1,251). Men and women differentiated
among children in ratings of problems, successes, and ambivalence. Men and not women reported greater
ambivalence regarding children with more physical­emotional problems and less career success. Men and women
reported greater ambivalence regarding children with less relationship success. Consistent with ambivalence the-
ory, individuals feel more ambivalent regarding problematic and less successful children but men's ambivalence
appears to be more sensitive to their children's problems and successes than women's ambivalence.

Problems and successes defined
Identifying problems among children often involves distin-
guishing between less controllable physical­emotional prob-
lems and more controllable lifestyle­behavioral problems
(Pillemer & Suitor, 2002; Suitor, Pillemer, & Sechrist, 2006).
Physical­emotional problems include health problems, devel-
opmental disabilities, and mental health issues. In contrast,
lifestyle­behavioral problems include financial trouble, drug
and alcohol abuse, and trouble with the law. Research sug-
gests that mothers evaluate grown children with physical­
emotional problems more favorably, whereas they view
children with lifestyle­behavioral problems with greater am-
bivalence (Pillemer & Suitor, 2002; Suitor & Pillemer, 2000).
To assess children's successes, researchers have typically
examined social roles, such as whether children are married
or employed full time. The importance parents place on dif-
ferent roles varies as a function of their own values (Ryff
et al., 1994) and the child's age. Thus, in the present study,
rather than examining the presence or absence of roles, we
examined middle-aged parents' ratings of how successful
they believed their children were in their careers and rela-
tionships compared with other children of their age.
This study examines parents' ratings of their children's
problems and successes simultaneously because parents
may hold complex and orthogonal beliefs about each of
their children's successes and problems in a family. For ex-
ample, a child with problems may experience success in
some areas and less successful children do not necessarily
have problems.
Differentiations among children
Prior work on child problems and ambivalence has fo-
cused mostly on older mothers and often reports of one child
(Pillemer & Suitor, 2002; Pillemer, Suitor, et al., 2007).
Older mothers differentiate among their children in ratings
of emotional closeness, the types of support they prefer to
receive, and the support they provide to children (Suitor,
Sechrist, & Pillemer, 2007; Suitor et al., 2006). In the pres-
ent study, we examine whether middle-aged men and women
differentiate among their children in ratings of problems,
successes, and ambivalence. Examining within-parent dif-
ferentiations allows us to assess whether characteristics of
the children contribute to parents' ratings of problems and
successes rather than only parent characteristics.
We also consider whether women and men vary in the ex-
tent to which they differentiate among their children. Because
mothers' relationships with children are often closer and in-
volve more contact, women may differentiate more among
children than do men (Umberson, 1989; Ward, 2008).
Implications of problems and successes for
ambivalence
Parents may feel more ambivalent regarding problematic
children and less successful children due to their lack of in-
dependence, needs for support, violation of normative expec-
tations, and elicitation of embarrassment (Pillemer & Suitor,
1991). In contrast, more successful children may provide a
source of pride, well-being, and reduced ambivalence.
Some studies report no associations between problems
and ambivalence (Pillemer & Suitor, 2002), and others
show that problems predict greater ambivalence. Pillemer,
Suitor, and colleagues (2007) found that mothers report
greater ambivalence regarding children with more lifestyle­
behavioral and physical­emotional problems. However,
other studies suggest that parents differentiate between
problems; mothers report feeling closest to children who
have physical­emotional problems but the least close to
children who have lifestyle­behavioral problems (e.g., sub-
stance abuse and trouble with the law; Suitor & Pillemer,
2000). It is not clear whether these findings regarding close-
ness also apply to feelings of ambivalence.
Furthermore, women and men may experience children's
problems and successes differently. Women's feelings of
ambivalence may be more highly associated with children's
problems and successes than mens' feelings of ambivalence
(Nelson et al., 2007). Mothers of young adult children with
mental illness experience more emotional distress than do
fathers (Cook, 1988). Similarly, older mothers experience
more stress related to their children's problems compared
with fathers (Greenberg & Becker, 1988). Women may pos-
sess more of a success orientation to children and experi-
ence greater impact of children's issues than men who
blame children for problems (McBride & Black, 1984).
Mothers may also experience a more detrimental impact
due to their greater investment in the tie (Rossi & Rossi,
1990). Other studies, however, reveal no gender differences
in associations between child problems and parental rela-
tionship perceptions (Greenfield & Marks, 2006).
Other factors influencing the parent­child tie
Other child characteristics may influence parents' per-
ceptions of their children. Ambivalence theory suggests
that parents feel more ambivalent about children who have
not reached adult roles indicative of independence, such as
employment, education, and marriage (Fingerman et al.,
2006; Pillemer & Suitor, 2002; Willson, Shuey, Elder, &
Wickrama, 2006). For example, mothers feel greater am-
bivalence regarding children who are not married (Pillemer,
Suitor et al., 2007) or who have lower education (Pillemer
& Suitor, 2005). Individuals also make differentiations
among their children based on children's gender, age, em-
ployment status, and parental status (Suitor et al., 2006).
Parent characteristics including race, marital status,
number of living children, socioeconomic status (SES)
(education and income), neuroticism, and self-rated health
may differentially influence the parent­child relationship
(Fingerman et al., 2006; Rossi & Rossi, 1990; Suitor et al.,
2006). For example, being African American, having more
PROBLEMS 147
education, scoring higher in neuroticism, and having
lower self-rated health are associated with greater ambiv-
alence (Birditt, Rott, & Fingerman, in press; Connidis &
McMullin, 2002; Fingerman et al., 2006).
Relationship characteristics including contact frequency
and financial dependence also differentially predict ambiva-
lence. Parents who report greater contact frequency and
greater financial support to children often report greater am-
bivalence (Fingerman et al., 2006; Pillemer & Suitor, 2002).
The present study included covariates for child, parent,
and relationship characteristics potentially associated with
ambivalence.
Study goals
This study addressed the following two questions:
1.Do women and men differentiate among their children in
their reports of problems, successes, and ambivalence?
We predict that individuals make differentiations among
their children in ratings of their problems, successes, and
ambivalence (Suitor et al., 2006, 2007), and there is
greater variation within individuals regarding each of
their children rather than between individuals. Because
mothers are often closer to children, we predict that
women differentiate among children more than men.
2. Are women's and men's reports of problems and suc-
cesses associated with ambivalence? We predict that indi-
viduals will report greater ambivalence regarding children
with more problems (lifestyle­behavioral and physical­
emotional). We also predict that lifestyle­behavioral
problems and ambivalence are more highly associated
than physical­emotional problems and ambivalence
(Pillemer & Suitor, 2002). We hypothesize that individu-
als feel less ambivalent about children they rate as more
successful. We expect that the associations are stronger
among women than men (Greenberg & Becker, 1988).
Methods
Participants
The Family Exchanges Study included 633 individuals
aged 40­60 years (302 men and 331 women from different
families) who had at least 1 child aged 18 years or older. We
randomly selected participants from phone lists obtained
through Genesys Corporation as well as through random
digit dialing from the Philadelphia Primary Metropolitan
Statistical Area (five counties in southeastern Pennsylvania
and four counties in New Jersey) and stratified by gender
and age (40­50 and 51­60 years; Pennsylvania State Data
Center, 2001). We oversampled participants living in Phila-
delphia county, high-density minority neighborhoods, and
lower SES households, which resulted in a total of 37% mi-
nority participants (see Table 1). Participants completed
hour-long computer-assisted telephone interviews and re-
ceived $25. Of the total number of participants contacted,
75% of the eligible individuals participated and completed
the interviews.

Participants answered detailed questions regarding up to
three of their children aged 18 years and older. Individuals
reported each child's gender, age, marital status, work sta-
tus, parental status, contact frequency, financial support
problems, successes, and relationship quality (N = 1,251).
Participants had an average of 2.61 (SD = 1.30) children
aged 18 years or older (range = 1­10). Of these children,
79.3% were aged 18­29 years. The majority of participants
(88%) had three or fewer children aged 18 years or older.
Most children (88.2%) were biological, 1.3% were adopted,
9.7% were stepchildren, and the remaining 0.9% were not
classified.A total of 48.2% of mother's offspring and 47.5%
of father's offspring were daughters. See Table 1 for a sam-
ple description.
Measures
Problems.--Individuals reported whether their children
experienced a series of problems, which we grouped into
two scales: physical­emotional problems and lifestyle­
behavioral problems (Pillemer, Suitor, et al., 2007).
Physical­emotional problems included two lifelong prob-
lems (having a developmental delay or disability and a
physical disability) and two problems in the past 2 years
(a serious health problem or injury and a serious emotional
or psychological problem). Lifestyle­behavioral problems
included four problems in the past 2 years: a drinking or
drug problem, financial problems, trouble with the law or
police, and divorce or other serious relationship problems.
We adapted this measure from the National Survey of
Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS;
Greenfield & Marks, 2006). Due to skew in distribution,
we summed the number of problems and truncated both
scores into 0, 1, and 2 or more problems. Each child re-
ceived a score for both types of problems.
Successes.--We adapted items from previous work (Ryff
et al., 1994) to assess parents' perceptions of children's suc-
cesses with two items (Fingerman et al., 2009). Respon-
dents indicated how successful they believed that each child
is compared with others of the same age in two domains,
career (education, work, and career) and relationships
(romantic relationships and family life), on a 5-point scale
(1 = less successful, 2 = somewhat less successful, 3 = about
the same as other people of his/her age, 4 = somewhat more
successful, and 5 = more successful than other people of
his/her age). Because participants were asked across the
domains with only two items rather than each domain sepa-
rately, there were little missing data on these items.
Child characteristics.--Individuals reported their child's
demographics and social roles. Demographics included
gender (0 = daughter and 1 = son) and years of education
(highest grade in school or year of college completed). We
dichotomized age to distinguish the period of emerging
adulthood (0 = ages 18­29) from young to middle adult-
hood (1 = ages 30­46; Arnett, 2000). Social roles included
the child's marital status (0 = not married and 1 = married
or remarried), parental status (0 = no children and 1 = one
or more children), and work status (0 = not employed full
time and 1 = employed full time).
Participant characteristics.--Participant characteristics
included demographics, health, and neuroticism. Demo-
graphics incorporated gender (0 = women and 1 = men),
race (0 = non-White and 1 = White), marital status (0 = not
married and 1 = married or remarried), number of living
children, education (highest grade or year of college com-
pleted), and income rated from 1 (<$10,000) to 6
(>$100,000). Individuals rated their physical health from 1
(excellent) to 5 (poor). We reverse coded the item so that
higher scores represent better health.
Neuroticism included four items from the MIDUS. Par-
ents indicated how well each of four adjectives (moody,
worrying, nervous, and calm) described themselves from 1
(a lot) to 4 (not at all). We reverse coded all items, with the
exception of calm, so that higher scores represent greater
neuroticism.
Relationship characteristics.--We also considered par-
ticipant reports of contact frequency and the financial de-
pendence of the child. Participants rated how often they had
seen each child in the past 12 months from 1 (daily) to 8
(less than once a year or never). We reverse coded the item
so that higher scores represent greater contact. Participants
reported how often they provided financial support to each
child (e.g., giving or loaning money, helping the child pur-
chase goods, services, insurance, and education) from 1
(daily) to 8 (less than once a year or never). We reverse
coded the item so that higher scores represent greater
financial support.
Ambivalence.--We combined assessments of positive
and negative perceptions of the relationship to generate am-
bivalence scores for each child (Fingerman et al., 2006;
Willson, Shuey, & Elder, 2003). This indirect approach is
associated with other measures of ambivalence (Willson
et al., 2003) and may be more effective than directly asking
participants about their mixed feelings (Pillemer & Suitor,
2002). Participants may have difficulty directly reporting
their mixed feelings (Luescher & Pillemer, 1998). Thus,
this measure reflects ambivalent (mixed) relationship qual-
ity rather than ambivalent (mixed) emotions. The positive
component included the mean of two items ("How much
does he/she make you feel loved and cared for" and "How
much does he/she understand you"). The negative compo-
nent included the mean of two items ("How much does he/
she criticize you" and "How much does he/she make de-
mands on you"). Participants rated items from 1 (not at all)
PROBLEMS 149
to 5 (a great deal). As in other studies of ambivalence
(e.g., Fingerman et al., 2008; Willson et al., 2006), we used
Griffin's Similarity and Intensity of Components formula to
calculate ambivalence scores: [(positive + negative)/2 -
|positive - negative|] + 1.5 (Thompson, Zanna, & Griffin,
1995). Higher scores reflect greater ambivalence.
Analysis strategy.--Analyses involved descriptive statis-
tics and multilevel models. We calculated means and cor-
relations among the variables to describe women's and
men's reports. Because the data included individual's re-
ports regarding multiple children, we used multilevel mod-
eling to address the issue of dependencies in the data (SAS
PROC MIXED; Littell, Milliken, Stroup, & Wolfinger,
1996; Singer, 1998). Multilevel models examined whether
individuals differentiated among their children and whether
problems and successes predicted ambivalence. Models in-
cluded a random effect allowing for correlated errors within
participants. Models included two levels: higher level par-
ticipant characteristics (e.g., gender and race) and lower
level child characteristics (e.g., problems and successes).
Blank multilevel models without predictors assessed
how much of the variance in individuals' ratings of their
children's problems, successes, and feelings of ambiva-
lence was due to between-person variance versus within-
person variance (Singer & Willett, 2003). We estimated
models for each outcome (physical­emotional problems,
lifestyle­behavioral problems, career success, relationship
success, and ambivalence). We then calculated intraclass
correlations by dividing each covariance parameter by the
total variance. To test whether women and men varied in
how much they differentiated among children, we com-
pared models in which there were separate between-person
variance components estimated for women and men with
those in which one variance component was estimated
across women and men. We then examined whether there
was a significant difference between the fit of the models by
subtracting the -2 log likelihood estimations of two models
and examining the difference on a chi-square distribution
with a degree of freedom equaling the change in number of
parameters (df = 1).
Next, we estimated multilevel models to examine whether
ambivalence varied by parents' reports of their children's
problems and successes. We estimated two models predict-
ing ambivalence for women and men separately. Predictors
included physical­emotional problems, lifestyle­behavioral
problems, career success, and relationship success. Covari-
ates included child characteristics, participant characteris-
tics, and relationship characteristics.
To examine whether models that included problems and
successes provided improved fit over models with only the
covariates, we statistically compared the goodness of fit of
the models (Singer & Willett, 2003). The goodness-of-fit
comparison involves subtracting the -2 log likelihood esti-
mations of two models and examining the difference on a
chi-square distribution with a degree of freedom equaling
the change in number of parameters (df = 4).
Results
We present the results in three sections. First, we provide a
description of individuals' reports of their children's prob-
lems, successes, and ambivalence. Next, we examine be-
tween- and within-person reports of children's problems,
successes, and ambivalence. Finally, we examine associations
among children's problems, successes, and ambivalence.
Description of Individual's Reports Regarding Children
Individuals reported that each child experienced an aver-
age of 0.22 (SD = 0.50) physical­emotional problems and
an average of 0.47 (SD = 0.69) lifestyle­behavioral prob-
lems. In other words, middle-aged parents reported that ap-
proximately 18.5% of offspring had physical or emotional
problems and 35.2% had one or more lifestyle-behavioral
problems. Physical­emotional problems and lifestyle­

behavioral problems were positively correlated (r = .21).
The most frequently reported problems within each cate-
gory included mental health problems (8%) and financial
trouble (26%). On average, parents rated their children as
slightly above their age-mates in career success (M = 3.50,
SD = 1.17) and as similar to peers in relationship success (M
= 3.15, SD = 1.06). Modest correlations were evident for
ratings of success and problems. Children with greater ca-
reer successes had greater relationship success (r = .38).
Children with more problems were rated as less successful
in careers and relationships (physical­emotional problems
rs = -.22 and -.13 and lifestyle­behavioral problems rs =
-.33 and -.25, respectively).
An examination of gender differences in ratings of prob-
lems, successes, and ambivalence revealed that women
rated their children as having more relationship success
(M = 3.22, SD = 1.10) than did men (M = 3.08, SD = 1.00;
t = 2.41, p < .05). Problems, career success, and ambiva-
lence did not vary by parental gender.
Between- and Within-Person Reports of Problems
and Successes
The next analyses tested the extent to which individuals
differentiated among their children and whether women
made greater differentiations among children than men.
Table 2 includes the intraclass correlations representing the
proportion of variance between and within women and men.
Consistent with the first hypothesis, we found greater with-
in-person variance in how parents viewed their children
than between-person variance. Inconsistent with the second
hypothesis, women and men made similar differentiations
among their children. There were no significant differences
in the fit of models in which separate between-person vari-
ance components were estimated for women and men and
Birditt et al.
150
the models in which only one between-person variance
component was estimated (Table 2).
Associations Among Problems, Successes, and
Ambivalence
Table 3 includes the multilevel models predicting am-
bivalence as a function of the covariates in the first column,
followed by a multilevel model predicting ambivalence as a
function of problems, successes, and covariates in the sec-
ond column. The models with problems and successes as
predictors of ambivalence provided a significantly better fit
than those with only the covariates as predictors of ambiva-
lence (Table 3).
As we hypothesized, children's problems were associated
with greater ambivalence. Men reported greater ambivalence
regarding children with more physical­emotional problems.
Somewhat surprisingly, there were no associations between
lifestyle­behavioral problems and ambivalence and no as-
sociations between problems and ambivalence among
women. As expected, women and men reported greater am-
bivalence regarding children with less relationship success.
However, only men and not women reported greater ambiv-
alence about children with less career success.
Ambivalence also varied by participant, child, and rela-
tionship characteristics. Participants reported greater am-
bivalence when they had higher levels of neuroticism and
more education and gave more financial support to off-
spring. Participants also reported greater ambivalence re-
garding daughters than sons. Women who reported more
contact frequency with children reported greater ambiva-
lence, and men reported greater ambivalence regarding
younger offspring. Because individuals' opinions of chil-
dren may vary depending on children's age, we also exam-
ined interactions among age of child, problems, and
successes as predictors of ambivalence and found no sig-
nificant interactions.
As an alternative way of examining the implications of
child problems and successes for ambivalence, we explored
whether children's problems and successes were differen-
tially associated with the positive and negative components
of ambivalence. According to ambivalence theory, parents
may perceive problematic and less successful children as
more positive and more negative. We estimated multilevel
models with problems, successes, and covariates as the pre-
dictors and positive and negative components of ambiva-
lence as the outcomes. Women reported greater negative
perceptions of children with lifestyle­behavioral problems
(B = .10, SE = 0.05, p < .05), and men reported greater neg-
ative perceptions of children with physical­emotional prob-
lems (B = .14, SE = 0.07, p < .05) and less relationship
success (B = -.10, SE = 0.03, p < .01). Women and men

Discussion
The present study examined men's and women's reports
of their children's problems and successes and whether
problems and successes predict ambivalence. This study
showed, not unexpectedly, that parents differentiated among
their children in their ratings of problems, successes, and
ambivalence. We also build on and extend findings of previ-
ous studies that either only examined older women's per-
ceptions of ambivalence or examined ambivalence toward a
single child. Including parents' opinions of up to three chil-
dren, we found that parents' perceptions of a child's prob-
lems and successes were related to ambivalent feelings and
that the specific patterns of associations differed between
men and women. Thus, ambivalence toward grown children
is a common experience for men and women, and these
feelings reflect in varying degrees children's lack of success
and/or problems due to more controllable and less control-
lable factors.
Do Women and Men Differentiate Among Children?
We found greater variation in parents' ratings of their dif-
ferent children's problems, successes, and ambivalence than

between individuals. We reiterate that our sample did not in-
clude mothers and fathers from the same family, but rather
the men and women were not related. Given this sampling
approach, the findings show that there is greater variation
within a parent regarding each of his or her own children than
between different unrelated parents regarding their children.
Women and men made similar differentiations in their
ratings of children. We had hypothesized that women would
make greater differentiations among children than men due
to their greater emotional closeness and emotional intensity
with children (Rossi & Rossi, 1990). More recent literature
has found a lack of variation between mothers and fathers
within the same families in several key variables, including
ambivalence and tensions (Birditt, Miller, Fingerman, &
Lefkowitz, 2009; Fingerman et al., 2006). There may be
fewer gender differences in more recent cohorts as women
and men take on more similar roles. The issues in adulthood
may be more gender neutral (as compared with adoles-
cence) and may elicit fewer gender differences. For exam-
ple, gender intensification theory suggests that children
experience an intensification of gender roles during adoles-
cence, which coincides with greater sex-typed parental so-
cialization (Hill & Lynch, 1983).
Do Children's Problems and Successes Relate to
Perceptions of Ambivalence?
Ambivalence theory suggests that parents experience
competing desires to launch their children into an indepen-
dent adulthood, yet conversely to help children in need of
support (e.g., children with problems). Thus, we predicted
that women and men would feel more ambivalent about
children with more problems but found only partial support
for this hypothesis. Ambivalence did not vary by lifestyle­
behavioral problems, and men (but not women) reported
greater ambivalence regarding children who had physical­
emotional problems. Fathers may have a more difficult time
accepting children with developmental delays, which may
manifest as ambivalence regarding young adult children
(Price-Bonham & Addison, 1978). It is possible that men
experience more long-term ambivalence about children
with disabilities than do women.
We were somewhat surprised that children's problems did
not predict greater ambivalence among women given past
research. Pillemer, Suitor, and colleagues (2007) found that
mothers rated children with more problems with more am-
bivalence. There were several variations between our stud-
ies. Pillemer, Suitor, and colleagues examined mothers aged
65­75 years and four types of problems (serious illness or
injury, serious mental or emotional problem, problems with
drinking or drugs, and problems with the law) and used a
direct assessment of ambivalence. Older mother's feelings
of ambivalence may be more highly associated with their
offspring's problems than younger mother's feelings. In-
deed, as mothers age, they may become more ambivalent
about problematic children due to their own age-related in-
creased needs for support. We examined problems ranging

in severity, which may not be as highly linked with ambiva-
lence. Finally, direct assessments of ambivalence may re-
flect more negative sentiments because participants report
how torn they feel rather than both positive and negative
qualities separately. These studies also vary in their geo-
graphic locations; however, there is little variation in the
parent­child tie between U.S. regions (Sechrist, Suitor,
Henderson, Cline, & Steinhour, 2007).
We also found support for the hypothesis that individuals
feel more ambivalent about less successful children. Women
and men reported more ambivalence about children with less
relationship success. Similarly, parents favor unmarried chil-
dren less than those who are married (Brackbill, Kitch, &
Noffsinger, 1988). Relationship success also involved the
parent's rating of children's success in romantic relationships
and family life, which may subsume the parent­child tie and
have direct links with ambivalence. Men reported more am-
bivalence about children who were less successful in their
careers. Men may experience higher expectations for their
children's career success than do women. Men may have had
children who were less successful than women; however,
men and women reported similar levels of career success.
The examination of the positive and negative components
of ambivalence allowed for a nuanced examination of par-
ents' perceptions. Parents perceived children with problems
more negatively but no less positively. In contrast, parents
perceived their more successful children as more positive
but not necessarily as less negative. These findings reveal
ambivalence by showing that positive and negative percep-
tions of relationships are not mutually exclusive.
Future Directions
There are several future research directions to consider.
Because of the cross-sectional design, the direction of the
links among ambivalence, problems, and successes is un-
clear and most likely bidirectional. Future research should
examine these linkages over time. Future studies should ex-
amine mothers' and fathers' reports of problems and suc-
cesses in the same families as well as the offspring's
perspective. Indeed, parents underestimate children's prob-
lems (Suitor & Pillemer, 2000). Children's problems may
contribute to lower parental well-being because of the over-
all strain of those problems on the relationship, and future
studies should consider these links (Greenfield & Marks,
2006). Despite few regional differences in the parent­child
tie (e.g., Sechrist et al., 2007), future work should consider
these associations nationally.
This study has clinical and gerontological implications.
Ambivalence predicts lower quality of life, more depressive
symptoms, and lower self-rated health (Fingerman et al.,
2008; Lowenstein, 2007). Clinicians should be aware of the
factors associated with greater ambivalence and the gender
differences. Indeed, men with problematic and less suc-
cessful children may be particularly vulnerable. Clinicians
should consider the social context of adults as they age and
how their family members may have positive as well as
negative influences. In addition, parents and children who
approach problems with constructive rather than avoidant
or destructive strategies report lower ambivalence (Birditt
et al., in press). Thus, considering how parents and children
cope with children's problems, and lack of successes may
help reduce the impact of problems and successes on am-
bivalence. As parents grow older and are more in need of
support, problematic and less successful children may be-
come even more detrimental to parents.
Because men and women reported on multiple children,
this study allowed for an examination of parental percep-
tions as a function of children's characteristics over and
above parent characteristics. Including men in the study re-
vealed that men's feelings of ambivalence were more sensi-
tive to their young adult's problems and successes than
women. Middle-aged men may have higher expectations for
their adult children than women. This study also revealed
that although parents may feel more negative about children
with problems, they feel no less positive regarding those
children. Likewise, parents generally reported feeling more
positive and no less negative regarding their successful chil-
dren. Parents' feelings about their children are multifaceted
and may have important implications for well-being and
support exchange across adulthood, especially among men.
