Abstract
Purpose: This study tested possible cross-country differences in the associations between diabetes and activities of
daily living (ADLs), and possible confounding / mediating effects of socio-economic status, obesity, and exercise.
Methods: Data came from Research on Early Life and Aging Trends and Effects (RELATE). The study included a total
number of 25,372 community sample of adults who were 40 years or older. We used data from community based
surveys in seven countries including China, Mexico, Barbados, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, and Uruguay. Demographics
(age and gender), socio-economic status (education and income), obesity, exercise, and ADL (bath, dress, toilet,
transfer, heavy, shopping, meals) were measured. Self-reported data on physician diagnosis of diabetes was the
independent variable. We tested if diabetes is associated with ADL, before and after adjusting for socio-economics,
obesity, and exercise in each country.
Results: Based on Model I (age and gender adjusted model), diabetes was associated with limitation in at least one
ADL in Mexico, Barbados, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, and Uruguay, but not China. Based on Model II that also controlled for
education and income, education explained the association between diabetes and limitation in ADL in Mexico and
Uruguay. Based on Model III that also controlled for exercise and obesity, in Cuba and Brazil, exercise explained the
link between diabetes and limitation in performing ADLs. Thus, the link between diabetes and ADL was
independent of our covariates only in Chile and Barbados.
Conclusions: There are cross-country differences in the link between diabetes and limitation in ADL. There are also
cross-country differences in how socio-economic status, obesity, and exercise explain the above association.

Introduction
About three hundred fifty million people have diabetes
worldwide [1]. With a direct medical cost of 465 billion
U.S. dollars in the year 2011, diabetes is responsible for
more than 10% of total healthcare expenditures in
adults [2].
People with diabetes are more likely to experience lim-
itations in activities of daily living (ADL), mobility, and
role functioning [3-5]. Given the growing rate of dia-
betes and its associated disability burden in the world
[2], for different reasons, more research is still needed
on the link between diabetes and ADLs [6].
First, research on disability among people with diabetes
may suggest avenues for reducing the disability attributable
to this common chronic disease [3]. Second, although dia-
betes has been consistently related to a broad spectrum of
health outcomes, including quality of life, ADL and mobil-
ity disability [7], and lower extremity function [8], it is not
clear if the association between diabetes and ADL remains
significant after controlling for other factors, and also it is
not clear if the same link exits in different countries [9].
Third, a large proportion of a major part of evidence on
the link between diabetes and burden of mobility-related
disability has originated from studies conducted on pa-
tients, or disabled individuals [9]. However, clinical samples
and community individuals vary on many factors and there
is a need to show the ADLs among individuals with

diabetes in a community sample. Finally, more research is
needed on cross-country differences in associations be-
tween diabetes and disabilities.
Although literature has frequently shown that diabetes
has a role in the disablement of people, further research
is needed to extend the current limited knowledge about
this association [9]. The current study tested cross-
country differences in association between diabetes and
ADLs.
Methods
Data came from Research on Early Life and Aging
Trends and Effects (RELATE), that included seven dif-
ferent studies [10]. This analysis included 25,372 individ-
uals who were age 40 or older. These individuals were
sampled in the following seven countries: China,
Mexico, Barbados, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, and Uruguay. All
surveys were fully in compliance with the Helsinki Dec-
laration on ethical principles for medical research in-
volving humans. Different institutional review boards
approved participating surveys.
The following countries were participating in RELATE
project and represented countries from a diverse range in
national income levels: Barbados represents high income
countries; Cuba, Uruguay, Chile, Brazil, and Mexico repre-
sent upper middle income countries; and China represents
lower middle income countries [11].
Although most country-specific surveys had sampling
weights, as recommended, the current study did not apply
sampling weights. The main reason was that sampling
weights were not applicable to data from China (China
Health and Nutrition Study; CHNS).
Measures
Demographic characteristics
The study measured age (continuous variable) and gen-
der (dichotomous variable of male and female) as two
demographic variables.
Socio-economic status
The study measured education (four level categorical
variable of 1) no schooling, 2) primary to elementary, 3)
secondary to intermediate, and 4) higher), and income
(continuous variable) as socio-economic status.
Obesity and exercise
The study measured obesity and exercise based on self
reported data. BMI larger than 30 was considered as
obesity.
Main outcome
Seven activities of daily living (ADLs) were measured by
a modified Barthel index [12-15]. ADL items that were
included in this study included bath, dress, toilet,
transfer, heavy, shopping, and meals. These items have
been frequently used to assess ADLs in the community
sample [16,17].
Data analysis
Data analysis was conducted using SPSS for Windows.
We used country specific logistic regressions to deter-
mine if diabetes is associated with ADLs, and if this link
is independent of socio-economic factors (education,
and income), obesity and exercise. In all models, at least
one ADL limitation was our outcome. In Model I, we
only adjusted for age and gender. In Model II, we also
adjusted for education and income. In Model III, we also
adjusted for obesity and exercise.
Results
Table 1 shows country differences by means of mean
age, education, income, and ADLs. Mean age was lowest
in China, and highest in Brazil. ADL limitation was
highest in Chile, and lowest in Uruguay. Education was
lowest in Brazil, and highest in Cuba. Income was high-
est in Uruguay and lowest in Cuba.
Model I
Based on the first model, with an exception of China,
diabetes was associated with ADL, and this link was in-
dependent of age and gender. Gender and age were as-
sociated with ADL in all countries (Table 2).
Model II
Based on Model II that also controlled for education
and income, education explained the association be-
tween diabetes and limitation in ADL in Mexico and
Uruguay. Based on this model, gender and age were as-
sociated with ADL in all countries. However, education
was not correlated with ADL in Barbados, Cuba, and
Uruguay. Income was linked to ADL in China and Brazil
(Table 3).
Model III
Based on Model III that also controlled for obesity and
exercise, in Cuba and Brazil, exercise explained the link
between diabetes and limitation in performing ADLs.
Based on this model, the link between diabetes and ADL
was independent of our covariates only in Chile and
Barbados. Based on this model, gender and age were as-
sociated with ADL in all countries. Obesity was linked
to ADL only in Barbados. Exercise was linked to ADL in
all countries (Table 4).
Discussion
Our study showed at least four important cross-country
differences in the pattern of association between diabetes
and disability; 1) in most (i.e. Mexico, Barbados, Brazil,

Chile, Cuba, and Uruguay) but not all countries (China),
diabetes seems to be associated with ADL, 2) in some
countries (i.e. Mexico and Uruguay), education explains
the association between diabetes and ADL limitation, 3)
in some countries (i.e. Cuba and Brazil), exercise ex-
plains the link between diabetes and ADLs, and 4) in
some countries (i.e. Chile and Barbados), the link
between diabetes and ADL seems to be independent of
our covariates/mediators.
Only in Chile and Barbados was the link between
diabetes and ADL independent of all study covariates/me-
diators. Based on a study in Japan, history of diabetes,
bone fractures, and heart diseases contributed to some
specific aspects of ADL disabilities, however, cerebrovas-
cular disease influenced all aspects of ADL [18].
We showed that in Cuba and Brazil, physical activity
might be a mechanism behind the link between diabetes
and ADL. According to the literature, at least a part of
the limitations in ADLs of patients with diabetes might
be due to function in extremities. A study examined
how hand disorders contribute to ADLs among elderly
men with diabetes, and showed that limited joint motion
(measured by prayer sign and Dupuytren's contracture)
was more common in individuals with diabetes, com-
pared to non-diabetics. Vibrotactile sense was impaired
symmetrically in the index and little fingers in diabetics
[19].
Peripheral artery disease and peripheral nerve dysfunc-
tion are known causes of diabetes -related disability
[9,20], and may explain more than 30% of the associ-
ation of diabetes with disability related dysfunction in
physical activity. Physical activity is particularly import-
ant for people with diabetes, because being physically ac-
tive can improve the body's ability to use insulin and
facilitate weight loss [21-25]. In the United States, for
example, only one-third of individuals with diabetes and
obesity are physically active [26,27]. Interventions need
to enhance physical activity of patients, and this may
break the cycle by which diabetes causes limitation in
performing ADLs.
The current study failed to show mediating or con-
founding effects of obesity on the association between
diabetes and ADLs. However, obesity had an independ-
ent association with ADLs in one of the seven countries
(Barbados). Literature suggests that obesity and over-
weight may mediate or confound the link between dia-
betes and disability. In a survey among obese diabetic
individuals, ADL was linked to current exercise, using
exercise programs, and self-reported weight history [28].
In a qualitative study among obese (body mass index
[BMI] > 30 kg/m2) individuals with diabetes, patients
believed that their performance of daily activities would
improve with weight loss of 5Â­10% of body weight [29].
The ability to remain physically active is an essential
aspect of quality of life and is critical for the preserva-
tion of independence among patients with diabetes.
Lower extremity function is a strong predictor of poor
health outcomes, including disability, hospitalization,
and death among patients [30,31]. Recently, a search for
potentially modifiable conditions associated with im-
paired mobility and lower extremity function identified

several socio-demographic and behavioral characteris-
tics, along with acute and chronic medical conditions
[32,33]. Among the latter group, diabetes has been
shown to be consistently a correlate of poor extremity
performance [34,35].
Several impairments and comorbidities are involved in
the disablement process associated with diabetes. Obes-
ity, visual impairment, and cardiovascular diseases may
mediate the association between diabetes and disability
among diabetic patients. These conditions are important
causes of different aspects of physical dysfunction in
older individuals [36,37].
The association between diabetes and ADLs did not
stay significant in the multivariable models in most
countries. The literature is also not informative about
the question of whether or not the link between diabetes
and disability is independent of other factors that
contribute to disability. We know that several conditions
that may contribute to the impairment in ADLs are
more prevalent in diabetic patients than controls. These
conditions may be the actual mechanisms by which dia-
betes is associated with physical disability. Some of these
conditions include cardiovascular diseases, peripheral
neuropathy, obesity, and visual deficits [35].
Our findings are important for different reasons. As
very few studies have shown exact mechanisms by which
disability is seen among patients with diabetes [35], our
knowledge about the mechanisms underlying the disabil-
ity among diabetic patients is limited. Further research is
needed to know which complication of the disease plays
a more important role in the disablement process.
Further research is also needed on possible synergistic ef-
fects of different conditions associated with diabetes [38].
In addition, prevalence of diabetes is expected to increase

considerably in the next decades [38]. And knowledge
from similar studies may be important for planning strat-
egies aimed at preventing or slowing functional decline
in older persons and for tertiary prevention in subjects
with diabetes [9].
Our study has strengths and limitations. This was a
cross-national survey composed of different surveys con-
ducted in seven countries [10]. Research on Early Life
and Aging Trends and Effects (RELATE) did not collect
data on duration of diabetes, or mental health of the
participants. Duration of diabetes is known to be
strongly linked to disability among patients with dia-
betes. We also did not collect data on degree of meta-
bolic imbalance, as we know loss of control of glucose
may be a mediator for the disabling effect of diabetes
[9]. Based on the literature, high prevalence of depres-
sion among diabetic patients may explain a substantial
proportion of the excess risk of disability associated with
diabetes. Depression is common among patients with
diabetes [39-41]. Longitudinal studies are warranted to
elucidate the role of depression in the pathway from dia-
betes to disability. Our study is one of very few studies
that contribute to our understandings of cross Â­ country
differences in morbidity related to diabetes. To study
cross Â­ country differences in mental health associates
of diabetes, one study used data from World Mental
Health, and showed that with a consistent pattern, in all
countries, mood and anxiety disorders occurred with
somewhat greater frequency among persons with dia-
betes than those without diabetes, and the strength of
association did not differ significantly across countries
[42]. It is essential to conduct more research to test if
the association between diabetes and disability is inde-
pendent of other chronic conditions or not [9].
Our study sheds light on cross Â­ country differences in
factors associated with well-being. Considerable differences
in morbidity, life satisfaction, and well-being have been
shown across the globe [43,44]. The World Values Survey,
European Values Study, Eurobarometer, and Latinobarom-
eter, have consistently shown that life expectancy, physical
health, all-cause mortality, and also subjective well-being
vary across countries [45-48].
Conclusion
To conclude, our study showed considerable differences in
the association between diabetes and disability across coun-
tries. The study also suggests that there might be some
cross-country differences in the factors that may explain
this link.
