Services Provided by Family Physicians
for Patients With Occupational Injuries
and Illnesses
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Many family doctors provide care to patients with occupational injuries
and illnesses, but little is known about the type of medical services provided, or
how they compare with services provided by other types of physicians. This study
used national data to develop a statistical profile of office-based medical care
delivered by family physicians to patients with work-related disorders.
METHODS Using data from 4 years (1997-2000) of the National Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey, we classified visits for patients with work-related conditions
according to patient and physician characteristics, services provided, and other
visit characteristics. For comparison, we also compiled profiles for visits to other
types of physicians for treatment of work-related disorders, and for visits to family
physicians for treatment of nonoccupational conditions.
RESULTS Analyses were based on 96,183 office visits made to 4,947 physicians.
A majority of visits made to family physicians for occupational conditions involved
patients seeing their regular primary care doctor. Possibly for this reason, patients
at these visits were more likely to have their blood pressure taken, receive diag-
nostic and screening services, and have prescription drugs prescribed or admin-
istered, compared with patients seeing other types of physicians. Only 73.3% of
visits to family physicians for work-related disorders were expected to be paid for
by workers' compensation insurance.
CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the distinctive types of care provided by
family physicians to injured workers may be related to their role as the patients'
regular physician. This finding is relevant to the proposals being considered by
many states to expand employers' and insurers' ability to choose the treating phy-
sician in workers' compensation cases.

INTRODUCTION
Medical care for patients with work-related injuries and illnesses in
the United States is generally governed by state workers' compen-
sation laws. In about one half of the states, injured employees are
free to choose their initial treating physician.1 Recently, many states have
given employers and insurers greater control over the choice of physician,
in hopes of improving care and reducing workers' compensation costs.2,3
Partly as a result, patients receiving primary care for a work-related
condition often are not treated by their regular doctor. Only one quarter
(25.6%) of visits for care of work-related conditions are provided by the
patient's regular primary care physician, compared with 51.2% among
patients being treated for nonoccupational conditions.4 Family physicians
traditionally have played an important role in providing care for patients
with occupational disorders, nevertheless. Approximately 22.9% of office
visits for care of work-related conditions are provided by family physicians.4

OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES AND ILLNESSES
Little is known about the specific services that fam-
ily physicians provide to patients with work-related dis-
orders, or how they differ from the services offered by
other types of physicians. This exploratory study aimed
to develop a nationally representative statistical profile
of the ambulatory medical care provided by family
physicians to patients with work-related conditions.
METHODS
This study used data from the National Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), a survey of physi-
cians providing office-based medical care in the United
States. NAMCS has been conducted annually since
1973 by the US National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS). NAMCS participants included both primary
care physicians and specialists providing direct patient
care in office-based settings. Our analyses used infor-
mation from the 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000 NAMCS
surveys, which were aggregated to yield sufficient sam-
ple sizes for a cross-sectional analysis of visits for work-
related conditions by physician type. Responses from
4,947 physicians covering 96,183 office visits were
analyzed. Response rates ranged from 63% (in 1999)
to 69% (in 1997). Rates of nonresponse for individual
items were generally less than 5%.5
NAMCS collected information on patient and
physician characteristics, the clinical practice setting,
reason for the visit, patients' symptoms and diagno-
ses, medical services provided, medications ordered
or administered, and the expected source of payment
for the visit. Information was provided by the treating
physician or the physician's clinical staff using a written
visit record form.5 Additional information regarding the
clinical practice setting was obtained through personal
interviews with participating physicians conducted by
the US Census Bureau, on behalf of NCHS.
NAMCS used a multistage probability sampling
design based on geographically related primary sam-
pling units, physician practice characteristics within
each of these units, and a systematic random sample
of patient visits within each physician practice. This
sampling procedure was designed to select respondents
representative of those providing office-based services
in various regions, practice settings, and populations
throughout the United States.6
The NAMCS target population included all physician
practices providing office-based patient care as classified
by the American Medical Association and the American
Osteopathic Association.5 NAMCS classified physicians
into 15 major groupings and 129 specific types based
on information supplied by the reporting physician or
clinical staff, applying codes developed by the Ameri-
can Medical Association and the American Osteopathic
Association. The general practice category contained 4
physician subtypes: family practice (coded as FP), family
practice­geriatric medicine (FPG), family practice­sports
medicine (FSM), and general practice (GP).
We classified each office visit as to whether it was a
visit for a work-related condition. Information collected
on the patient record form allowed us to identify those
visits in 2 ways: listing of workers' compensation as the
primary expected source of payment for the visit, or
a physician's answering yes to the question, "Was this
visit related to injury or poisoning?" followed by an
affirmative response to a follow-up question, "Was this
injury work-related?" Of 13,191 patient visits made to
family physicians, 326 involved treatment for work-
related conditions.
The basic unit of analysis for this study was the
patient visit. Visit weights were calculated by the NCHS
based on the sampling strata adjusted for response rates
in each survey year. Descriptive statistics for patient
visits from 1997 to 2000 were stratified according to
whether the visit was made to a family physician for
treatment of a work-related condition (FP-WR visits),
a physician other than a family physician for treatment
of a work-related condition (OP-WR visits), or a family
physician for treatment of a non­work-related condition
(FP-NWR visits). We also calculated these statistics for
patient visits to occupational medicine physicians (Occ-
Med-WR visits), to establish a comparative benchmark
of how specialists in the treatment of work-related con-
ditions care for patients. To examine how certain factors
affect family physicians' care for patients with work-
related conditions, FP-WR visits were further stratified
by whether care was paid for by workers' compensation
insurance, the family physician was the patient's regu-
lar primary care physician, and the patient was a new
patient (ie, one not seen previously by the physician).
We performed t tests for continuous variables and
2 tests for discrete variables to assess the statistical
significance of differences between the various visit
categories. Because estimates derived from our analy-
ses were based on a sample rather than on the entire
target universe of office visits, our results were subject
to sampling error. To account for the complex sample
design of the NAMCS, calculations were performed
by the Taylor series approximation method using the
SURVEYMEANS procedure in SAS software version
9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), with Strata and Cluster
variables specified.7 The reported P value ranges reflect
this adjustment for the effect of sampling design.
RESULTS
The distribution of office visits by each of 15 major
physician groupings is summarized in Table 1. Family

OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES AND ILLNESSES
physicians provided care at 22% of visits nationally for
patients with work-related conditions, second only to
orthopedic surgeons (33.7% of those visits). Visits for
patients with work-related conditions represented 2.5%
of all office visits and thus accounted for only a small
proportion of family physicians' total visit load.
Descriptive statistics for patient visits, stratified by
type of visit, are summarized in Tables 2 through 4.
Table 2 shows the demographic characteristics of the
patients. The majority of patients at FP-WR visits were
male, white, and non-Hispanic. Patients seen for work-
related conditions, in general, were more likely to be
male and to be of working age (15-64 years old) than
those seen for non­work-related conditions.
The characteristics of the medical care provided for
each type of physician visit are summarized in Table 3.
The distribution of diagnoses for OP-WR visits was gen-
erally similar to that for FP-WR visits, involving mostly
acute injuries (eg, cuts and bruises) and musculoskeletal
disorders. The physician was the patient's regular pri-
mary care physician at the majority (59.2%) of FP-WR
visits. Compared with OP-WR visits, FP-WR visits were
more likely to be for treatment of acute problems and
to involve diagnostic and screening services, the taking
of patients' blood pressure, surgical procedures, and the
administration or ordering of prescription medications.
They were less likely to involve follow-up services, men-
tal health counseling, or psychotherapy. On average, FP-
WR visits lasted 17% fewer minutes than OP-WR visits.
Patients seen during OccMed-WR visits had diag-
noses similar to those of patients seen during FP-WR
visits, but were more likely to be administered fol-
low-up treatment, therapeutic and preventive services,
injury prevention counseling, and physiotherapy. They
were less likely to be treated for chronic problems than
patients at FP-WR visits. FP-WR visits were consider-
ably less likely than either OP-WR or OccMed-WR
visits to be paid for by workers' compensation insur-
ance, require insurer authorization for care, and be set
up through a referral from another physician. On aver-
age, FP-WR visits were substantially shorter than either
OP-WR or OccMed-WR visits.
FP-NWR visits had a diagnostic mix that differed
noticeably from that of FP-WR visits and had a dis-
similar patient population (eg, a greater proportion of
patients who were not of working age). Consequently,
the care provided at FP-WR visits differed considerably
from that provided at FP-NWR visits. Despite these
differences, the average time spent by family physicians
for either a work-related or a non­work-related condi-
tion was approximately the same (16.1 and 16.3
minutes, respectively).
Table 4 itemizes the types of medications
prescribed or administered at office visits. In gen-
eral, medications were prescribed or administered
to patients less often at visits for work-related
conditions than at visits for non­work-related
conditions. Slightly less than one half of the medi-
cations prescribed or administered at FP-WR and
OP-WR visits were for pain relief, compared with
60.8% for patients seeing occupational medicine
physicians. The distribution of type of medications
at FP-NWR visits differed significantly from that
at FP-WR visits, presumably because of the under-
lying differences in diagnostic and patient mix.
Among FP-WR visits, the pattern of pre-
scribing or administering medications differed
somewhat between new patients and established
patients. New patients had a drug prescribed or
administered at 51.9% of these visits, compared
with 68.5% of visits made by patients who had
seen that doctor previously (P = .06).
On average, prescription medications were
more likely to be ordered or administered at FP-
NWR visits than at other types of visits. Specifi-
cally, the mean number of medications ordered
or administered was 1.39 per FP-NWR visit,
compared with 0.79 per FP-WR visit, 0.68 per
OccMed-WR visit, and 0.64 per OP-WR visit.

OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES AND ILLNESSES
Table 5 summarizes the characteristics of care pro-
vided during the FP-WR visits, stratified by workers'
compensation payment, primary care physician status,
and new patient status. Compared with visits paid for
by private health insurance or other sources, visits paid
for by workers' compensation insurance were more
likely to require insurer authorization for care and to
involve new patients. Those visits were less likely to
have involved follow-up services, and the treating phy-
sician was less likely to be the patient's regular primary
care physician.
When a family physician was the patient's regu-
lar primary care physician, visits were more likely
to involve treatment for chronic (rather than acute)
conditions and to include therapeutic and preventive
services. Those visits were less likely to be paid for by
workers' compensation insurance, to require insurer
authorization, or to involve new patients or patients
referred from other physicians. Similarly, FP-WR visits
involving new patients were less likely to be made
for routine chronic problems or musculoskeletal dis-
orders than were visits by patients who had seen the
physician previously. Those visits were more likely to
involve a referral from another physician, to be paid
for by workers' compensation, and to require insurer
authorization for payment.
Interestingly, stratifying the FP-WR visits by work-
ers' compensation payment, new patient status, and
primary care physician status had little effect on the
distribution of services provided during the visit. The
only difference was a slightly greater likelihood among
patients seeing their regular primary care doctor to
receive therapeutic and preventive services. Otherwise,
no significant differences between visit categories were
observed with respect to the types of services provided.
DISCUSSION
This exploratory study has produced a profile of
medical care visits provided by family physicians for
patients with work-related injuries and illnesses. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the nation's first study
focusing specifically on the types of
medical care and services provided by
family physicians to injured workers.
The use of nationally representative
NAMCS data allowed us to describe
these visits according to key patient
and medical care characteristics.
Our data indicate that family phy-
sicians play a leading role in treating
injured workers in the United States,
delivering nearly one quarter of the
office visits for patients with work-
related injuries and illnesses. Family
physicians provide approximately
3 times as many visits each year to
injured workers as do occupational
medicine specialists. Because only
a small proportion (2.5%) of office
visits are made by patients with work-
related conditions, however, many
family physicians may not be aware
of their substantial contribution to
the care of America's injured workers.
Our study found that the majority
(59.2%) of patients with work-related
conditions who see a family physician
are receiving care from their regular
primary care doctor, compared with
only 13.1% of injured workers seen
by other types of physicians. One rea-
son is that many injured workers are
treated by specialists, such as orthope-
dic surgeons and occupational medi-

cine physicians. Also, many
states now allow employers
and insurers to choose the
treating physician in work-
ers' compensation cases,
making it less likely that a
patient will see his or her
regular primary care physi-
cian. Recently, many states
have expanded employers'
and insurers' control over
the choice of physician
in workers' compensation
cases, in hopes of thereby
constraining costs.1-3 Worker
and advocacy groups have
expressed concerns about
this trend, believing that it
detracts from effective coor-
dination and continuity of
care, and could jeopardize
the quality of care by direct-
ing patients to physicians
who will inappropriately
limit patient services in
response to employer and
insurer interests.7-9
Our study's findings may
be relevant in this regard.

OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES AND ILLNESSES
For example, patients with work-related conditions vis-
iting family physicians were more than twice as likely
to have their blood pressure measured during a visit
than were patients seeing other types of physicians
(57.2% vs 24.2%). When the family physician was also
the patient's primary care physician, that proportion
was even higher (59.1%). Similarly, injured workers
seeing a family physician were 27.6% more likely to
receive diagnostic and screening services, and 39.6%
more likely to have a drug administered or prescribed
compared with patients seeing other types of physi-
cians. This pattern suggests that family physicians care
for patients with work-related conditions in a broader
context than do physicians who merely see a patient

OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES AND ILLNESSES
on a single occasion for a discrete work-related injury.
Family physicians may be more apt to view the patient
as a whole person, to be aware of comorbidities and the
patient's history, and thus to use these visits as an oppor-
tunity for assessing and caring for the individual's overall
health, compared with physicians who have a narrower
focus restricted to treating a specific work-related injury.
In this respect, it is interesting that there were no
significant differences between family physicians and
other types of physicians in the delivery of therapeutic
and preventive services, exercise counseling and educa-
tion, injury prevention counseling and education, and
physiotherapy services to injured workers. Perhaps fam-
ily physicians give comparable emphasis (as other phy-
sicians) to treating the specific work-related injury, but
additionally place greater emphasis on general health
screening and diagnosis during the visit. Similarly, it is
conceivable that family physicians' greater tendency to
prescribe or administer drugs during the visit reflects
their attention to their patients' comorbidities and the
need for their "regular" patients to have prescriptions
refilled while at the office. Indeed, new patients seeing

OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES AND ILLNESSES
family physicians for treatment of a work-related con-
dition had a drug prescribed or administered at 51.9%
of visits, compared with 68.5% of visits among patients
who had seen that doctor previously.
Only 73.3% of FP-WR visits were expected to be
paid for by workers' compensation, compared with
83.4% of visits to other types of physicians and 93.8%
of those to occupational medicine physicians. These
findings are consistent with other studies indicating
that many legitimate cases of work-related conditions
are not reported to workers' compensation insurers
and thus are not reflected adequately in data based on
workers' compensation claims filings.10-13 It has been
estimated that 10% to 40% of cases are not reported.
Suggested reasons for underreporting include fear of
reprisal from employers, lack of knowledge about how
to file claims, physicians' failure to correctly identify
work-relatedness, and inappropriate denial of claims
by workers' compensation insurers. The differences in
workers' compensation payment observed in this study
between family physicians and other types of physi-
cians may indicate that patients seeing their regular
primary care doctor are more likely to seek payment
through conventional private or public health insurance
than to try to secure coverage and reimbursement from
the employer's workers' compensation insurer. Although
potentially expedient for both patient and doctor, this
practice should be discouraged for several reasons: (1)
the resulting underestimation of occupational injuries
detracts from the usefulness of workers' compensation
data for surveillance and prevention, (2) this practice
could make it more difficult for the worker to obtain
wage replacement and other workers' compensation
benefits, (3) it may necessitate patient copayments or
other out-of-pocket expenses that would otherwise be
covered by workers' compensation, and (4) physicians
might be less likely to provide prevention, return-to-
work, and impairment determination services that are
normally covered in workers' compensation cases.
Our comparison of the care provided by family
physicians with that provided by occupational medi-
cine specialists suggests that there are ways in which
family physicians can enhance their services for injured
workers. For example, compared with family physi-
cians, occupational medicine specialists were nearly
3 times more likely to provide injured workers with
injury prevention counseling and education. Interest-
ingly, family physicians were equally as likely as occu-
pational medicine specialists to provide their patients
with exercise counseling and education. This finding
suggests that family physicians caring for injured work-
ers might need additional training and familiarity with
effective injury prevention techniques that can be
used by the patient or suggested by the patient to the
employer. Several commentators have noted the bar-
riers doctors face in incorporating injury prevention
counseling into primary medical care.14-17 Providing
injury prevention advice is an important goal, however,
especially for patients with work-related disorders who
may continue to face injury hazards when they return
to their jobs.
Our results suggest that family physicians often
use a patient's visit for a work-related condition as an
opportunity to assess the patient's overall health and
provide care for other nonoccupational comorbidities.
In theory, combining both types of services in a single
visit could enhance continuity of care and improve
the quality of care for work-related conditions, for
example, through better understanding of the relation-
ship between the patient's underlying medical condi-
tion and their work-related disorder, and by identifying
potentially dangerous drug interactions. Additional
research is needed to examine this issue thoroughly and
to assess its implications for states' efforts to control
injured workers' choice of physicians and limit their
ability to see their regular family doctor.
Another topic for additional research suggested by
this preliminary study is whether providing injury pre-
vention counseling and education to the injured worker
during the visit affects the type of medical services
delivered, the likelihood of follow-up visits, and even-
tual patient outcomes, such as recovery of vocational
function and reduction of pain. Some of these ques-
tions could be investigated by further analysis of the
NAMCS data, for example, the relationship between
providing injury prevention counseling during the visit
and the delivery of medications, physiotherapy, and
other services during the visit. Using NAMCS data, it
would also be possible to examine the effect of provid-
ing counseling on the length of visit. We suspect that
providing injury prevention counseling would reduce
the need for certain other medical services (eg, physio-
therapy) while only slightly lengthening visit duration.
Other data sources would be needed to examine
longer-term follow-up issues, such as the relationship
between injury prevention counseling and the likeli-
hood of return visits or additional therapeutic services.
Ideally, it would be useful to investigate the extent to
which the delivery of particular services (blood pres-
sure monitoring, injury prevention counseling, prescrip-
tion drug use) is related to physician type, diagnosis,
practice characteristics, workers' compensation status,
geographical region, and patient characteristics (sex,
age, race/ethnicity). It would also be desirable to ana-
lyze the relationship between the observed patterns
of care and long-term patient outcomes, including
functional recovery, return to work, costs, and patients'
experience with care. In this preliminary study, we did
ANNALS OF FAMILY MEDICINE  WWW.ANNFAMMED.ORG  VOL. 4, NO. 2  MARCH/APRIL 2006

OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES AND ILLNESSES
not have access to potentially important information
that would be relevant, such as the patient's employ-
ment status, occupation, and general health status; the
mechanism of injury; the severity of the patient's condi-
tion; costs of care; or the patient's eventual functional
and vocational outcomes.
Our exploratory analysis had other limitations. It
was based on self-reported information from physi-
cians and clinical staff, and thus was subject to possible
reporting errors or omissions. There was no way to
independently verify the data contained in NAMCS.
Special training provided to participating physicians by
NCHS about how to complete the survey forms pre-
sumably helped mitigate such potential errors.
The data compiled in this preliminary study will
be useful for establishing benchmarks to help family
physicians assess the extent and type of services cur-
rently provided for work-related conditions, relative
to national norms. The data should help state workers'
compensation officials better understand family physi-
cians' role in caring for injured workers. Additionally,
the study highlights gaps in knowledge that can be
addressed through additional research. The goal of
research in this area is to identify ways of improving
care for workers with occupational injury, to deliver
care in an efficient manner, and, ultimately, to promote
better overall health outcomes for patients.
