Introduction
The growth in outsourcing, in particular human resource
(HR) outsourcing, has been triggered by the enduring efforts
of organizations to reduce costs, to focus on strategic issues,
and to improve services to the employees (Chiang & Shih,
2011). Although HR departments used to be known as per-
forming administrative work, they are now becoming more
and more strategic oriented to assist organizations to compete
and sustain through various challenges (Braun, Pull, Alewell,
Störmer, & Thommes, 2011; Cook & Gildner, 2006). Indeed,
many researchers posit that HR outsourcing concentrates on
restructuring the HR department, refocusing activities, and
redeploying HR resources (Chiang & Shih, 2011; Greer,
Youngblood, & Gray, 1999), so that organizations can "make
more by doing less" (Gilley & Rasheed, 2000).
The existing literature only suggests that among the areas
neglected in HR are the partnership quality and the impact of
service quality on the success of HR outsourcing. The market
for the service providers of outsourced services is growing
rapidly and concurrently, HR outsourcing has evolved from
single service provider to multiple service providers easily
contracted to satisfy the different needs of the organizations
(Lilly, Gray, & Virick, 2005; Reichel & Lazarova, 2013).
The quality of relationship between a client and a vendor and
the quality of the service provided by a vendor to the client
have been indicated to influence the success or failure of the
outsourcing initiative (Chakrabarty, Whitten, & Green,
2008). As HR outsourcing development in Malaysia has not
been intensively studied, managers may still have lack of
knowledge on how to select the right service providers and
how to manage the outsourcing relationship (Ee, Abdul-
Halim, & Ramayah, 2013). To many organizations, manag-
ing the relationships between organizations and service
providers has become increasingly complex because both
parties may have different desires and agenda when develop-
ing and maintaining HR outsourcing relationships (Ates,
2013; Lievens & Corte, 2008). Furthermore, the inadequate
choice of outsourcing partners can also impede the success
and quality of outsourcing relationship (Elmuti & Kathawala,
2000; Tapiero, 2006). Many organizations fail to opt for the
right partners and are not able to build a stable and trustwor-
thy relationship with their service providers. Thus, to ensure
the quality and successful relationship with the service pro-
viders, organizations must be aware that the outsourcing
partners should be selected based on the expertise of the out-
sourcing partners in their operations, the cultural similarity

Human Resource Outsourcing Success:
Leveraging on Partnership and Service
Quality

Abstract
The existing literature on partnership seems to take the relationship between partnership quality and outsourcing success
for granted. Therefore, this article aims at examining the role of service quality in strengthening the relationship between
partnership quality and human resource (HR) outsourcing success. The samples were obtained from 96 manufacturing
organizations in Penang, Malaysia. The results showed that partnership quality variables such as trust, business understanding,
and communication have significant positive impact on HR outsourcing success, whereas in general, service quality was found
to partially moderate these relationships. Therefore, comprehending the HR outsourcing relationship in the context of
service quality may assist the organizations to accomplish HR outsourcing success by identifying areas of expected benefits
and improvements.

between the service providers and the organizations, the abil-
ity of both parties to establish strategic alliances, and the
willingness of the outsourcing partners to adopt the philoso-
phy of the organizations (Lau & Hurley, 1997; Tapiero,
2006). Along these lines, both parties need to develop a cer-
tain mechanism to strengthen the quality of HR outsourcing
relationship to function more as a partnership (Ates, 2013;
Elmuti, 2003; Lee & Huynh, 2005). High partnership quality
involves a high level of trust, commitment, quality commu-
nication, understanding, and strong top management support
between the organization and the service provider. High ser-
vice quality from the service provider would involve high
reliability, responsiveness, tangible, assurance, and empathy.
Undeniably, these aspects of partnership quality and service
quality would positively influence the effective utilization of
various HR functions for better interactions between the ser-
vice provider and the organizations, and eventually may lead
to HR outsourcing success.
Nevertheless, the existing literature on partnership seems
to take the relationship among partnership quality, service
quality, and outsourcing success for granted (Chakrabarty et
al., 2008; Lee, 2001). There should be justification whether
HR outsourcing is successful when high-quality partnership
exists. Consistent with the above argument, this study was
designed to explore the factors of partnership quality in the
context of HR outsourcing that may lead to outsourcing suc-
cess, which would be moderated by service quality. After a
brief review of related literature and hypotheses develop-
ment, the theoretical framework will be presented. The
method and techniques used for the analysis and the results
are given in the following sections. The final section presents
the discussion and limitations.
Literature Review
Theoretical Perspectives and HR Outsourcing
In the literature on HR outsourcing, transaction cost theory
and relational exchange theory provide insights into organiza-
tional motivation for outsourcing. Transaction cost theory
states that there are economic costs involved in the transac-
tions between two or more entities (Williamson, 1975, 1985).
The costs include operational costs (e.g., search costs, inven-
tory holding costs, operation cost) and contractual costs (e.g.,
cost of writing and enforcing a contract cost). Organizations
need to choose whether to produce and make an activity on
their own or to outsource that activity. Relational exchange
theory also plays an important role in the framework of out-
sourcing. Past studies of HR outsourcing have largely
neglected the quality of relationship aspects of the client­
vendor behavior. Much focus has been given on outsourcing
transaction as discrete events (Kim & Chung, 2003; Sheehan
& Cooper, 2011). To place emphasis on the importance of
managing outsourcing relationship for success, it is important
to view HR outsourcing from the partnership perspective
rather than solely from the economic perspective. It is neces-
sary to include relational exchange characteristics along with
several key dimensions. Relational structure can be used to
address the behavioral and procession aspects of relationship
in joint ventures, partnership, and outsourcing arrangements
(Ginevicius, 2010; Reichel & Lazarova, 2013).
Partnership Quality and Outsourcing Success
In general, a partnership involves common values that exist
among parties involved (Ren, Ngai, & Cho, 2010).
Partnership quality is very crucial in determining the success
of HR outsourcing. Nevertheless, a part of the knowledge on
building successful partnership in HR outsourcing is becom-
ing a dilemma for many organizations. HR practitioners lack
the know-how in selecting their outsourcing vendors and
there are also concerns on how they should manage this out-
source relationship (Ates, 2013; Lee & Kim, 1999). In the
less developed market, some organizations are even reluctant
to establish a partnership in their outsourcing agreement,
although this method has been proposed to be the most effec-
tive method to achieve competitiveness. The most frequently
reported problem in the outsourcing relationship among cli-
ents and their HR vendors is the inability to express and
describe in detail what they require from the vendors (Ates,
2013). This scenario will lead to conflict and inefficiency in
the outsourced activity.
Partnership is not a new concept and it has long been
explored in the marketing and interorganizational systems
research. Any organization's activities would not sustain
without relationships with the surrounding environment
(Raman, Chadee, Roxas, & Michailova, 2013). According to
interorganizational research, recognizing, analyzing, and
promoting the interorganizational relationships are the pre-
requisites and keys for organization to gain knowledge,
deploy resources, and pursue continuous competitive advan-
tages. By definition, interorganizational relationships embed-
ded in the organization are seen to be the repeated interaction
and exchange process between organization and other orga-
nizations, and a set of a series of sustained social connections
in business (Raman et al., 2013; Ren et al., 2010).
There have been different views on how to implement suc-
cessful relationships. The two groups of thoughts that have
emerged from previous researches are transactional style rela-
tionship and partnership style relationship. The transactional
relationship is developed through a formal contract and part-
nership is formed through relationship exchange that involves
risk and benefit sharing (Srinivasan, Mukherjee, & Gaur,
2011). Lee (2001) in his work states that in the 1990s, many
organizations experienced difficulties in forming and manag-
ing successful outsourcing relationships. This problem caused
a shift from contractual relationship to a partnership relation-
ship in the outsourcing industry. Partnership allows two orga-
nizations to achieve key organizational objectives and build
competitive advantage in their respective industries (Ates,
Abdul-Halim et al. 3
2013; Grover, Cheon, & Teng, 1996). Therefore, it is interest-
ing to study whether HR outsourcing success would be
affected by the quality of the partnership. Quality can be
described as fitness of use. Partnership quality exists when
relationship serves its intended function and is successful in
meeting objectives of both parties. Partnership is affected by
organizational, human, and environmental factors. Lee and
Kim (1999) propose that partnership has its own factors to
represent quality. They state that there are several variables
that influence the degree of partnership quality and the degree
of partnership quality is related to the outsourcing success.
They identify five factors that make up partnership quality,
which are trust, business understanding, benefit and risk shar-
ing, conflict, and commitment. Anderson and Narus (1990)
also identify that trust can also lead to higher quality partner-
ship, besides other variables such as communication and top
management cooperation. All these factors have been identi-
fied as the factors making up partnership quality. The com-
munication quality plays an effective role in partnership.
Effective communication between partners is essential to
achieve the intended objectives. In fact, effective communi-
cation will lead to better informed parties, which in turn will
make each party to be more confident in the relationship and
more willing to maintain it (Lee & Kim, 1999; Swar, Moon,
Oh, & Rhee, 2012). Apart from that, the support from top
management is very essential and is considered as a prerequi-
site for every successful outsourcing partnership (Anderson
& Weitz, 1989). Top management has to play an effective role
to overcome the inevitable divergence of interest between
participants and at the same time to share an understanding of
the benefits of collaboration (Rai, Borah, & Ramaprasad,
1996; Srinivasan et al., 2011).
When organization embarks on outsourcing relationship
and selects a particular service provider, the organization
must be ready to maintain the relationship over a period of
time. The need to maintain such business relationships
requires a form of long-term relationship based on trust.
Both parties need to believe one another to perform actions
that will result in positive outcomes for the organizations
(Lee & Kim, 1999; Swar et al., 2012; Willcocks & Chong,
1995). In addition, commitment also plays a critical role in
the development of a long-term relationship and in facilitat-
ing an exchange relationship. These relationships must con-
tain a certain degree of sincerity, pledge, or promise of
relationship continuity between partners. Therefore, trust
and commitment are the basic concepts of partnership style
relationship and these factors increase confidence in the rela-
tionship and in turn lead to outsourcing success (Chu &
Wang, 2012; Lee, 2001; Moore, 1998). Finally, outsourcing
success is also motivated by business understanding,
whereby both parties have the ability to understand each
other in terms of the operation dealings, behavior goals, and
business procedures and policies (Hsu, Wu, & Hsu, 2005;
Srinivasan et al., 2011). In short, partnership quality helps
foster cooperative relationship based on trust, business
understanding, commitment, communication, and the top
management (Ates, 2013; Chu & Wang, 2012). These factors
are critical in determining the success of outsourcing, par-
ticularly in the area of HR.
Outsourcing success refers to the overall organizational
advantage derived from HR outsourcing (Ren et al., 2010). In
other words, outsourcing success is defined as the satisfaction
with the benefits attained by an organization as a result of
deploying outsourcing and successful outsourcing is a power-
ful tool for organization to generate values and gain competi-
tive advantage (Grover et al., 1996). In fact, outsourcing
success can be identified from the business perspective and
user perspective (Lee & Kim, 1999; Swar et al., 2012).
Business performance can be measured by the qualitative
impact of strategic and technological improvement and the
quantitative improvement in terms of economic returns. Kim
and Chung (2003) mention that there are two indicators for
outsourcing success, namely, satisfaction and perceived ben-
efits. Satisfaction involves evaluation of all aspects of the per-
ceived effectiveness of the interorganizational relationship. In
contrast, perceived benefits are clients' firm's perception of
benefits gained from a specific outsourcing relationship.
Successful partnership enables the organizations to
achieve organizational objectives and to build a competitive
advantage that each organization could not easily attain by
itself (Khong, 2005; Lee & Kim, 1999). This situation may
lead to HR outsourcing success in which the effectiveness of
the business process is enhanced (Hsu et al., 2005). More
focus on core activities such as talent retention and career
planning provides value-added services in business, improves
service level and accountabilities, enhances quality of cus-
tomer experience, and achieves cost optimization, which
would reflect on HR outsourcing success for firms. Studies
have found a significant relationship between partnership
quality and outsourcing (Grover et al., 1996; Ren et al.,
2010). Indeed, partnership allows two parties to achieve key
organizational objectives and build competitive advantage,
and a good partnership with service providers is proposed as
the key success in outsourcing strategy. Based on the above
arguments, it is proposed as follows:
Hypothesis 1 (H1): There is a positive relationship
between partnership quality and HR outsourcing success.
Hypothesis 1a (H1a): There is a positive relationship
between trust and outsourcing success.
Hypothesis 1b (H1b): There is a positive relationship
between business understanding and outsourcing
success.
Hypothesis 1c (H1c): There is a positive relationship
between commitment and outsourcing success.
Hypothesis 1d (H1d): There is a positive relationship
between communication and outsourcing success.
Hypothesis 1e (H1e): There is a positive relationship
between top management support and outsourcing
success.

Service Quality
Service quality can be defined as the conformance to cus-
tomer requirements in the delivery of a service (Chakrabarty
et al., 2008; Park, Lee, Lee, & Truex, 2012). Services are
fundamentally different from physical goods and the mea-
surement of quality in service delivery has been proved to
be more complicated than measuring the quality of physical
goods (Bowen & Schneither, 1988; Braun et al., 2011).
Services tend to be performance oriented, therefore making
precise specifications to a uniform quality difficult to mea-
sure and execute (Abu-El Samen, Akroush, & Abu-Lail,
2013; Kettinger, Choong, & Lee, 1994). In a similar vein,
Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry (1988) define service
quality as the degree and discrepancy between service
receiver's expectation and perceptions. This means that the
smaller the gap, the greater service quality is achieved.
Service quality is more difficult to measure in comparison
with quality of goods because the characteristics of a ser-
vice are intangible, inseparable, and heterogeneous. Service
quality perceptions will result from a comparison of con-
sumer expectations with actual service performance.
Service quality has been the most researched area of ser-
vices marketing (Fisk, Brown, & Bitner, 1993) and it was
first established by Parasuraman, Berry, and Zeithaml
(1985) who undertook an exploratory investigation of ser-
vice quality by commencing with a series of focus group
interviews with consumers and executives at four nation-
ally recognized service organizations. As a result, the
SERVQUAL instrument was developed as a frequently
used measure of service quality.
Specifically related to outsourcing success, service qual-
ity research has shown many mixed results. Grover et al.
(1996) posit that service quality significantly and negatively
interacts with application development outsourcing in its
relationship with outsourcing success. In this case, outsourc-
ing quality evaluations are not made solely on the partner-
ship quality but will also involve evaluation of service quality
in the process of service delivery. As noted, service quality is
a measure of how well the delivered service matches cus-
tomer expectations (Chakrabarty et al., 2008). HR outsourc-
ing is a service that is provided by a service provider for
organizationsthatinvolvefacetsofservicequality.Delivering
quality service means conforming to customer expectation
on a consistent basis that is believed to lead to better out-
sourcing success. Outsourcing implementation involves the
quality of both the service provider and the partnership.
Grover et al. (1996) suggest that both partnership quality and
service quality affect the degree of outsourcing success.
Over the years, there have been a variety of studies on
different issues pertaining to service quality and partnership
quality. Determinants of partnership quality have been stud-
ied by Saunders, Gebelt, and Qing (1997); Lee and Kim
(1999); and Lee (2001). Although researches have shown
that partnership quality is a key predictor of outsourcing
effectiveness, existing literature fails to examine the impor-
tance of service quality that may contribute to partnership
quality (Park et al., 2012; Sigala, 2004). This study proposes
that partnership is the key to outsourcing success and this
relationship will be stronger (moderated) under increased
level of service quality.
Partnership context can be described as the degree part-
ners believe that this relationship can be sustained over
time (Chu & Wang, 2012). There are two reasons on how
service level may affect the performance of the partnership.
First, poor quality service may lead to conflict in partner-
ship because the service provider is unable to meet the
organization's needs. Conflicts arise because both parties
are unable to meet a service agreement (Moore, 1998; Park
et al., 2012). Second, poor service quality may also destroy
trust in the partnership because firms are unable to believe
that the service provider's actions would result in positive
outcomes for the firms, thus leading to outsourcing failure
(Chakrabarty, 2008). To investigate and explore service
quality of service providers, the Application Service
Provider Quality model (ASP-Qual) instrument by Sigala
(2004) has been adopted. Sigala (2004) develops her model
by modifying the widely accepted SERVICE QUALITY
(SERVQUAL) model developed by Parasuraman et al.
(1988). Modification of instruments for measuring service
quality in other environment is allowed because
SERVQUAL is an instrument that collects only perception
data and these data may differ from an industry to another
(Jabnoun & Al-Tamimi, 2003).
The existing literature on partnership seems to take the
relationship between partnership quality and outsourcing
success for granted. Not many studies have been done on the
partnership quality of HR outsourcing. Therefore, it is cru-
cial to explore on service quality to strengthen the HR out-
sourcing success. Based on the arguments above, it is
proposed as follows:
Hypothesis 2 (H2): The relationship between partnership
quality and HR outsourcing success will be stronger with
higher level of service quality.
Hypothesis 2a (H2a): The relationship between partner-
ship quality and outsourcing success will be stronger with
higher tangibles
Hypothesis 2b (H2b): The relationship between partner-
ship quality and outsourcing success will be stronger with
higher reliability.
Hypothesis 2c (H2c): The relationship between partner-
ship quality and outsourcing success will be stronger with
higher responsiveness.
Hypothesis 2d (H2d): The relationship between partner-
ship quality and outsourcing success will be stronger with
higher assurance.
Hypothesis 2e (H2e): The relationship between level of
partnership quality and outsourcing success will be stron-
ger with higher empathy.

Based on the arguments above, the research model is
exhibited in Figure 1.
Method
Population and Sample
This study used a mail survey questionnaire to obtain the
data. The population of this study was manufacturing organi-
zations in Malaysia that outsourced their HR function(s).
These organizations were selected from the Federation of
Malaysia Manufacturer (FMM) Directory. The question-
naires were targeted to the head of HR department, or the
persons responsible for HR of Malaysian manufacturing
organizations who are engaged with HR outsourcing. They
were in the position to provide data on HR outsourcing and
can be considered as the best persons to interpret the success
of outsourcing strategy. Purposive sampling method was
used in which the organizations were first contacted to
enquire on their engagement with HR outsourcing. Thus,
only organizations that outsourced HR functions were
selected to participate in this study.
Measurement Instrument
The determination of outsourcing success was adopted
from the instrument of Grover et al. (1996) and was
designed on the 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly dis-
agree; 5 = strongly agree). The instrument was used to
measure outsourcing business performance and was vali-
dated by other researchers. The measurements for the vari-
ables used in the questionnaire were adopted from Lee and
Kim (1999). In this study, perceptual measure for the vari-
ables of partnership quality was employed. The 5-point
Likert-type scale was also used to test the multi-item con-
structs for partnership quality such as trust, business under-
standing, top management support, communication, and
commitment. The measurement for service quality was
adopted from the ASP-Qual model by Sigala (2004). The
5-point Likert-type scale was used to test the dimensions of
service quality such as tangibles, reliability, assurance,
responsiveness, and empathy.
Factor Analysis
Factor analysis was conducted to check the validity and reliabil-
ity of the measurement scales. The Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze and test the hypoth-
eses. The results of Barlett's Test of Sphericity for the three
separate groups were significant and the Kaiser­Meyer­Olkin
(KMO) measures of sampling adequacy were all from 0.7 to
0.86 with the percentage of variance explained above 42% for
all the factors. The cutoff used for factor loadings was set at 0.5
to ensure that each item was only uniquely assigned to only one
factor. Cronbach's alpha of each factor is as follows:
 1. Business understanding,  = 0.73
 2. Trust,  = 0.91
 3. Commitment,  = 0.71
 4. Communication,  = 0.81
 5. Top management,  = 0.87
 6. Outsourcing success,  = 0.80
 7. Tangible,  = 0.83
 8. Reliability,  = 0.86
 9. Responsiveness,  = 0.78
10. Assurance,  = 0.93
11. Empathy,  = 0.84
Analysis and Results
Profile of the Respondents
Of the 228 questionnaires distributed, a total of 99 question-
naires were returned at the end of the data collection process.
Thus, the response rate was 43.42%. Although the response
rate was less than 50%, Three of the ninety-nine question-
naires returned were less than 30% completed by the respon-
dents and hence were abandoned from the analysis. The final
96 completed sets of questionnaire were used in this study.
Table 1 shows the profile of the respondents.
28.1% of the respondents were from the electronics and
electrical industry and 76% of the organizations employed
less than 10 HR employees. In terms of the position of the
respondents, 42.7% of them were the HR managers and
the mean period for the outsourcing of HR function was
about 5 years with an average of about 1,002 employees.
On the profile of the number of HR functions outsourced by
the organizations, training was the most frequently outsourced
function (63.5%). The recruitment function recorded the sec-
ond highest percentage with 58.3%, followed by operator/labor
supply with 44.8%. The least outsourced function was com-
pensation and benefits with 16.7%. Table 2 summarizes the
various HR functions outsourced by the respondents.

variables. The significance of F change was 0.00, implying
that there was a significant relationship between partnership
quality and outsourcing success. The results showed support
for H1a, H1b, and H1d. Trust was found to be positively and
significantly correlated at 1% level ( = 0.47). The beta value
of .47 indicated that trust was the most influential variable in
explaining outsourcing success. As a result, H1a was sup-
ported. In addition, business understanding also showed a
significant impact on the success of outsourcing ( = 0.16).
Therefore, H1b was also supported. H1c was also supported
in which communication showed a significant relationship
with outsourcing success ( = 0.26). In contrast, commit-
ment and top management support were found to be not sta-
tistically significant with the outsourcing success.As a result,
H1c and H1e were not supported .
The Moderating Effect of Service Quality on
Outsourcing Success
Five hierarchical regression analyses were performed in this
study to examine the relationship between partnership
quality and outsourcing success with service quality as the
moderator. Analyses were carried out for components of ser-
vice quality, namely tangibles, reliability, responsibility,
assurance, and empathy. In Step 1, the five partnership qual-
ity variables were entered with outsourcing success as the
dependent variable. In Step 2, the moderating variable was
entered. Finally, in Step 3, the interaction terms were entered.
A significant change in R-squared in Step 3 would indicate
the existence of the moderator effect. Initial data on normal
p­p plots and histogram of all SPSS results were normally
distributed. Therefore, the basic assumptions of linearity and
normality were met.
Table 4 presents the model summary for the three-step
hierarchical regression results with tangibles as the modera-
tor variable. As shown in Table 4, tangibles showed a signifi-
cant positive relationship ( = 0.24, p < .05) with outsourcing
success. It was also observed that the significance of F
change was .02 (p <.05) in Step 3, implying that three of the
interaction terms were significant, namely, trust ( = 2.06, p
< .05), commitment ( = -1.71, p < .10), and communication
( = 2.03, p < .05). These findings suggested that tangibles
only moderated three of the five independent variables inves-
tigated. The R-squared change with the influence of the
quasi-moderator was 8%.

To interpret the moderator effect, trust, commitment,
communication, and tangibles were split at the median to
form low and high subgroups. Then, each subgroup was
plotted against outsourcing success. A similar method was
used for the other independent variables. Figures 2 to 4
show the interaction effect, thus H2a was partially
supported.
Therefore, interactive line graphs were used to explain the
moderator effects. The results in Figure 2 show that when
tangibles level was high, outsourcing success increased from
low to high as trust level increased. When tangibles level was
low, the rate of increase for outsourcing success was very
much lower, as trust level increased from low to high.
Therefore, it can be assumed that when tangibles level was
high, it had a greater impact on outsourcing success, as trust
level increased from low to high.
From Figure 3, it can be observed that for the high tangi-
bles level, the impact of commitment on outsourcing success
was stronger compared with the low tangibles level.
The result shown in Figure 4 implies that the impact of
communication on outsourcing was stronger for low tangi-
bles level as compared with high tangibles level.
As can be observed from Table 5, the moderator (reli-
ability) showed no significant relationship with the depen-
dent variable (HR outsourcing success). Reliability was
found to be a pure moderator. Significance of F change was
.01 (p < .05) in Step 3 of the hierarchical regression analy-
sis, indicating that one of the interaction terms was signifi-
cant, namely, top management support ( = 2.58, p < .05).
The R-squared change was 10%.
As can be observed from Figure 5, for a high level of reli-
ability, increase in top management support had less influ-
ence on outsourcing success. When reliability level was low,
it had a greater impact on outsourcing success, as top

H2d was not supported because the relationship between
partnership quality and outsourcing success was not stronger
with higher reliability.

6% in Step 3. Significance of F change was .07 (p < .1) in
Step 3 of the hierarchical regression analysis, indicating that
one of the interaction terms, namely, communication ( =
2.27, p < .05) was significant.
As shown in Figure 6, when responsiveness level was low,
increased level of communication from low to high had no
impact on outsourcing success. However, when responsive-
ness level was high, outsourcing success increased as com-
munication increased from low to high. Hence, this finding
suggested that a high level of responsiveness had a significant
impact on outsourcing success, as communication level
increased from low to high. Based on the findings shown in
Figure 6, H2c was supported.
Table 7 shows the result of the hierarchical regression
analysis with assurance as the moderator. In Step 2, R-squared
indicated that 49% of outsourcing success was explained. Of
the 49%, 4% was explained by assurance variable. The
increase was significant (p < .05). Thus, assurance had a
positive relationship with outsourcing success ( = 0.31, p <
.05). In Step 3, all the five interaction terms were added into
the equation. No interaction terms were found to be signifi-
cant. Based on the findings, H2d was not supported.
As shown in Table 8, it can be concluded that empathy
had no significant positive relationship with outsourcing suc-
cess. Therefore, it was a pure moderator. It was also observed
that the significance of F change was .06 (p < .1) in Step 3,
implying that one of the interaction terms, namely, trust was
significant ( = 2.18, p < .10). The finding presented that
empathy only moderated one of five independent variables
investigated. The R-squared change was 6%.
The results shown in Figure 7 imply that when empathy
level is low, outsourcing success will increase from low to
high as trust level increases. At a high level of empathy, the
increase in outsourcing success is stronger as trust level
increases. Therefore, it can be concluded that a high level of
empathy has a greater influence on outsourcing success,
when trust level increases from low to high. As such, H2e
was supported.
Discussion
The results revealed that there was a strong positive relation-
ship between trust and outsourcing success. This result was
consistent with previous works such as Lee and Kim (1999),
Parker and Russell (2004), Lee and Huynh (2005), and
Gurung and Prater (2006). Trust is an important component
in partnership quality because it is a central aspect of a suc-
cessful outsourcing relationship from the beginning of a rela-
tionship to the end (Anderson & Weitz, 1989; Ates, 2013;
Moore, 1998). An absence of trust can lead to disruption of
information flow, coordination problems, and conflicts
between organizations.
The finding also indicates that business understanding is
an important factor in an outsourcing agreement because of
the shared responsibility, benefits, and risks involved in the
process. Essentially, the organizations' profit is partly
depending on the ability of their outsourcing partner to sup-
port their business operations. Understanding clients' expec-
tation and knowing the organization's capability in providing
these services will lead to a viable partnership (Chu & Wang,
2012; Lee & Kim, 1999).
This finding suggests that communication is a critical
activity that allows information flow between different

parties during different stages of outsourcing activity (Chu &
Wang, 2012; Galanaki & Papalexandris, 2007). In essence,
communication skills help the organizations communicate
their wants and needs accurately to their service providers,
thus allowing things to be done right the first time. This
practice will prevent loss of time and wastage of resources,
thus leading to a better outsourcing outcome. Therefore,
meaningful discussion is vital in planning, goal setting,
implementation, coordination, and performance evaluation.
However, the results show that neither commitment nor
top management support has a significant association with
HR outsourcing success. This finding is not consistent with
the findings of Lee and Kim (1999). It is possible that for
Malaysian organizations, the role of commitment is over-
shadowed by other components of partnership quality such
as trust and business understanding. Initial trust will lead
both parties to the disposition to believe that the other party
would fulfill the commitment and behave in a predictable
way (Lee & Huynh, 2005; Swar et al., 2012). Business
understanding and communication serve as important eco-
nomic and cognitive cues in outsourcing success.
Organizations are more dependent on the higher trust, stron-
ger business understanding, and better communication as
these elements are the drivers to positively influence out-
sourcing success. As for top management support, it can be
assumed that HR practitioners are able to manage the out-
sourcing relationship proficiently without the assistance of
the top management. This may be due to the fact that the
employees themselves are responsible or have a positive atti-
tude in making outsourcing a success. Once top management
has decided what functions to outsource, they typically del-
egate the commitment to their middle management to man-
age and administer the outsourcing activities as they believe
that their employees have the capability and functional
knowledge in making it a success.
As for the moderating impact, tangibles were found to
moderate the relationship between partnership quality (trust,
commitment, and communication) and outsourcing success.
Nevertheless, the hypotheses for variable tangibles were
only partially supported. The relationship between trust and
commitment with outsourcing success was found to be stron-
ger with a higher level of tangibles. In contrast, relationship
between communication and outsourcing success was stron-
ger at a lower level of tangibles. Perhaps, when tangibles
level was high, the customers were able to observe and feel
for themselves the ability of their service providers.
Therefore, when tangibles are already high, an increase in
communication level would not bring about much change in
outsourcing success.
Next, reliability was found not associated with the rela-
tionship between partnership quality (top management sup-
port) and outsourcing success. The results indicated that HR
outsourcing success was influenced more by partnership
quality at a low level of reliability than by a high level of reli-
ability. The relationship between top management support
and outsourcing success was stronger at a lower level of reli-
ability. Top management support was more important for out-
sourcingsuccessatlowlevelsofreliability,astopmanagement
would need to step in to intervene. In other words, when reli-
ability is low, top management support is needed to closely

monitor the service providers and to identify possible strate-
gies and solution to improve the operational results. If all
other efforts fail to improve performance, top management
also has the power to cease the relationship with the service
provider. Thus, when reliability level of service provider is
high, an increase in top management support will not bring a
significant change in outsourcing success, as HR practitioners
are trusted to be able to manage the partners on their own.
Responsiveness was found to positively moderate the
relationship between partnership quality (communication)
and outsourcing success. The relationship between commu-
nication and outsourcing success was stronger with a higher
level of responsiveness. When responsiveness level is high,
communication could bring a significant improvement in
outsourcing success. The service providers will help the cus-
tomers and provide them with prompt services through com-
munication. In contrast, if the service providers are not
responsive, then any information derived from communica-
tion would not be used for improvement purposes.
Responsiveness is needed for all service providers to remain
competitive, as the response time matters most to customers
in relationship for outsourcing success. In this study, it was
also observed that assurance did not significantly moderate
the relationship between the partnership quality (trust, busi-
ness understanding, commitment, communication, and top
management support) and outsourcing success. The service
provider's ability to inspire trust and confidence through
knowledge and courteous actions of their employees is not
able to influence the relationship between partnership quality
and outsourcing success. Other than that, assurance was
found to directly influence outsourcing success but it did not
moderate the relationship.
Finally, it was found that the relationship between trust
and outsourcing success was stronger with a higher level of
empathy. When empathy level is high, trust could bring a
significant improvement in outsourcing success because ser-
vice providers are thoughtful, considerate, and able to pro-
vide customized services whenever the need arises.
Empathetic service providers are dependable especially dur-
ing crisis and emergencies because they can be trusted to
think of their clients'best interest in the outsourcing relation-
ships. At lower levels of empathy, increasing levels of trust
also would not bring about much outsourcing success
because service providers are not able to perform to the
required level of customization.
Implications
The findings of this study are of value not only to the practi-
tioners responsible for managing HR outsourcing, but
equally to the researchers interested in understanding the
phenomenon of HR outsourcing relationship. This study
contributes to the body of knowledge in distinguishing the
dimensions of partnership quality and service quality in the
context of HR outsourcing success. It specifically identifies
five factors of partnership quality that determine the success
of HR outsourcing, which is strengthened by the factors of
service quality. There has been no consensus on how service
quality forms an HR outsourcing relationship. In this regard,
this study attempts to draw a consensus on recognizing those
factors of service quality that moderate the association
between partnership quality and HR outsourcing success.
This study also offers useful guidelines for HR managers.
It is common to find that organizations outsource more than
one HR function and in fact most of them outsource training
and recruitment functions. This finding indicates that HR
outsourcing as a competitive strategy in Malaysia is still rela-
tively new than other countries and probably many of its
potential benefits are not fully understood. Therefore, by
understanding the relationship with the service providers, the
organizations are able to achieve outsourcing success by
identifying areas of expected benefits and improvements. It
is important to understand the components of partnership
quality to develop a solid relationship with the vendor, irre-
spective of whether one specific HR function is outsourced
or more and ultimately the most impact on HR outsourcing
success. Trust has been found to have the strongest impact
and this finding suggests to managers that they can use trust
as a foundation for successful outcomes in the outsourcing
relationship with their partners. Frequently, outsourcing
strategies are viewed negatively by the service receivers
because of the fear of losing control over the process. It takes
time to build trust in a partnership. Therefore, initial trust
would be a qualitative attribute that managers should look
for in their selection of vendors for outsourcing. For organi-
zations that are already practicing outsourcing, they should
integrate activities such as information exchange on long-
range plans, benefits and risk sharing, mutual problems, and
knowledge sharing; all these activities can enhance the part-
nership trust level and improve the working relationship.
Apart from that, organizations must also understand that
there should be an open and frequent communication
between service providers and service receivers. This is
because proper communication facilitates negotiation and
transfer of information and resolves possible conflicts in any
outsourcing relationship. Managers should therefore insist
on timely and creditable communication channels. In addi-
tion, organizations can have better understanding on how
service quality works in the HR outsourcing relationship.
Overall, the elements of service quality only partially moder-
ate the relationship. Being sensitive and aware of the pres-
ence of service quality as moderators is important for service
receivers. This is because it may provide HR managers with
some subtle cues for selection and evaluation of the right
service providers in which the finding suggests that organi-
zations should search for service providers with high levels
of tangibles, responsiveness, and empathy.
This study also assists HR managers that business under-
standing should become an extension of a particular organi-
zational work culture when they handle outsourced HR
12 SAGE Open
functions such as training, recruitment, employee records,
and other functional tasks. In this matter, occasionally con-
flict and disagreement in needs may hamper outsourcing
success. Consequently, understanding of roles and responsi-
bilities of the service providers and service receivers is a cru-
cial aspect of partnership quality that requires special
managerial attention. Prior to entering a partnership, the
business mission of both parties needs to be properly under-
stood. This could be achieved through having a set of
assigned goals for each specific milestone in the relationship
to serve as check points. Apart from that, it is not unusual to
find service providers competing among each other by imi-
tating one another on the type of services offered. However,
service quality should also be a priority for service providers
if they are to build a strong reputation for their organizations.
This is because customers evaluate services from a series of
judgments over time. Superior quality will aid the reputation
building of service providers and it is not something that can
be replicated easily as it is an implicit knowledge and unique
to a particular competitor.
Limitation and Future Research
First, the sample size is small due to the low response rate
and time constraint. Obtaining more robust results would
require a larger sample size. Second, in this study, one ques-
tionnaire represents an organization, thus the person who
filled up the questionnaire may be biased and non-represen-
tative. Next, limited numbers of similar research have been
carried out on this topic. Therefore, to overcome these limi-
tations, this article includes literature review from other
industries mainly from the Information System (IS) and
Information Technology (IT) industry. Finally, the effect of
partnership quality on HR outsourcing success of this study
is limited to only manufacturing firms in Malaysia.
More researches can be conducted to examine the pro-
posed model on HR outsourcing success. First, it would be
interesting to extend this research to, for example, service
industry to obtain more generalized findings to provide a bet-
ter understanding on the growing trend of HR outsourcing in
Malaysia. Next, analysis of the relationship between partner-
ship quality and outsourcing success from the service pro-
vider's perceptive would also provide a broader perspective.
It is also suggested that a longitudinal research be carried out
to investigate the dynamic features of outsourcing partnership
as it will provide a more robust result than a snapshot research.
Finally, more variables could be examined as an extension to
this study. Other variables reflecting factors such as firm
environment, strategic orientation, corporate philosophy, cul-
ture, and organizational practice could be included.
Conclusion
In a nutshell, it is essential to comprehend that the influence
of partnership quality on HR outsourcing success is
moderated by the service quality. In this study, organizations
should realize that the success of HR outsourcing is very
much dependent on their relationship with the service pro-
viders, which take into account the significant factors such as
trust, business understanding, commitment, communication,
and top management support. In addition, the impact of mod-
erating factor that is service quality is equally essential to
strengthen the relationship between partnership and HR out-
sourcing success. In light of the above, it was found that only
trust, business understanding, and communication have an
impact on HR outsourcing success, and service quality par-
tially moderated these relationships. Therefore, it is antici-
pated that this research would be able to provide some
insights to the organizations pertaining to the partnership
quality, service quality, and HR outsourcing success, while
offering guidelines for organizations to plan accordingly in
selecting the appropriate service providers.
