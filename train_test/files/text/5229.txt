Journal of Workplace Rights
Introduction
Current U.S. policies surrounding the needs of an employee's
right to care for his or her family are inadequate. American
families and workplaces are not only diverse by race, gender,
or overall makeup but are also varied in the way they treat and
plan for the care of a child, an elderly person, or a sick family
member. However, no single national family policy measure
unequivocally aims at reducing female career interruptions
and increasing men's involvement in the childrearing or
elderly care domains. The Family and Medical Leave Act of
1993 (FMLA), and almost every state law counterpart pro-
vides unpaid leave for a finite time, but half of American
workers are either ineligible to take family leave or cannot
afford it (Ajinka, 2013). Only four states, California, New
Jersey, District of Columbia, and Rhode Island have imple-
mented a form of paid family leave. Although women are
entering the workforce in greater numbers and many are key
income earners in their household (Selmi & Cahn, 2006),
they are entering workplaces that continue to reinforce the
male-breadwinner/female-homemaker family model because
of continued societal constructs. The unintended conse-
quences heavily impact women, children, and low-income
families as well as any employee with caregiver responsibili-
ties. For the majority of employees living in other states, the
rising childcare and eldercare costs present families with dif-
ficult choices.
The United States continues to lag behind many industri-
alized and developing nations in the degree to which they
provide protection for the employee with caregiving respon-
sibilities. The United States remains the only industrialized
nation that does not provide a national paid leave for family
caregiving (Eichner, 2010). State and Federal law govern
policies surrounding parental work leave for taking time off
to care for a newborn child, adoption, or an ailing family
member. The only statutory protections granted by federal
law for families are the FMLA, the Pregnancy Discrimination
Act of 1978 ("PDA"), and the Fair Labor Standards Act as
amended in 2010 which includes a provision to support a
break time for nursing mothers.

Don't Leave U.S. Behind: Problems
With the Existing Family and Medical
Leave Act, and Alternatives to Help
Enhance the Employee Work - Family
Relationship in the 21st Century
Janice Arellano1
Abstract
This article examines the pace at which Federal and State legislation were implemented to provide working parents and
caregivers the ability to take time off for the birth or adoption of a child, to care for the elderly, sick or disabled family
members, and others in need of care. Compared with many industrialized nations, the United States ranks alongside the least
generous countries in terms of providing a balanced lifestyle between work and family life. For instance, the United States
does not even provide national paid family leave. This article provides the history, purpose, and scope of the Family and
Medical Leave Act, and later implementations of State programs. Furthermore, this article will present a brief survey of the
paternal, maternal, and parental leave policies of other countries and will provide suggestions for changing existing federal
policies to provide a more conducive family and work balance for employees.

The FMLA was signed into law to promote work­life bal-
ance for American workers. It grants covered employees the
right to take 12 weeks of unpaid leave within a span of a
12-month period to care for oneself, a child, spouse, or par-
ent. Most importantly, FMLA guarantees the right to return
to one's job following the leave. Other than caring for one's
child following birth or adoption, the only way to request
leave for oneself, a spouse, or parent is to determine whether
the ailment is defined as a serious illness under the FMLA
statute. As a result, ongoing care such as for the common
cold or injury may not apply.
Under the PDA, employees cannot be fired, denied a pro-
motion, demoted, or forced to stop working because they are or
might become pregnant. Moreover, employers cannot refuse to
hire someone because she may become pregnant. However,
unlike the FMLA, the PDAdoes not require employers to grant
any leave time for pregnant women and does not guarantee job
protection. The only protection mothers have falls under the
Fair Labor Standards Act which provides nursing mothers the
right to take a reasonable break to express milk at work (U.S.
Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division, 2010).
It is clear from recent media coverage that manyAmericans
still find this promised work­life balance to be unattainable.
On one hand, there seems to be a growing number of men and
women who have once "opted out" of the paid labor market
to care for children, on the other hand, commentators urge
working women to "lean in" and secure job protection before
raising a family (Sandberg, 2013). Existing family policies do
not assist workers faced with the choice of either opting out or
leaning in. As women have moved into the workplace in the
last decade, gender barriers in the workforce have rarely
changed. Despite the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay
Act, which allows individuals subjected to unlawful pay dis-
crimination to assert their rights under federal anti-discrimi-
nation laws, American job structures have largely remained
premised on a model that assumes at least one caregiver stays
at home, namely, the breadwinner (also known as the home-
maker family model; Barzilay, 2012). Today, with the econ-
omy struggling to improve, policies such as paid sick days
and paid family leave are more important than ever. Especially
during these difficult economic times, losing a job takes a toll
on employees and their families and adds demands on an
already strained market while indirectly affecting employers
who prioritize cost containment over employee quality and
retention (Selmi & Cahn, 2006). A change is adamant for
America to achieve equality in the workplace, and to improve
family life. Women should not be forced to turn down their
workplace roles to achieve a work­life balance.
This article is about the needs of workers to have job pro-
tection and compensation in the event of a crisis at home. This
article will discuss the FMLA, how the FMLA reinforces
gender inequality, and how the FMLA is ultimately inade-
quate in helping employees care for their family members in
times of need. Then, it will demonstrate that the current
FMLAis inferior to certain states'progressive legislation, and
the progressive legislation of other nations. Finally, this arti-
cle will offer changes to existing federal legislation to provide
a better work­family lifestyle for employees.
The Rising Cost of Childcare and
Eldercare
American employees are entering the workforce while the
costs of caring for children and elderly continue to rise.
Parents of children under 18 years of age and families with
elders in need of care are devoting a greater percentage of
their income to provide support. Studies show that those who
do not pay a hefty amount for childcare or eldercare have a
higher risk of unsteady employment and workplace absen-
teeism because they need to take care of their family mem-
bers (Matthews, 2006). Over the past decades, both women
and men are working longer hours outside of the home.
Women are either working full-time jobs or juggling multi-
ple part-time positions to make ends meet. Accordingly, the
demands to keep up with male counterparts in all types of
industries illustrate that women are increasingly becoming
key income earners in their home and leaving very little
recourse to change that pace (Selmi & Cahn, 2006).Although
most families are affected by the costs of care, low-income
families are likely to have fewer resources to reconcile the
consequences of balancing the demands and costs of care.
Although the U.S. Government provides subsidies for
childcare, through HeadStart and Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families, the cost of such programs do not meet the
overwhelming demands of the population. Consequently,
some states have implemented a cap on the amount of subsi-
dies it will offer low-income families. For example, states
offer certificates or vouchers that allow families to purchase
care from any provider that meets state regulations and
licensing standards (Kimmel & Hoffman, 2002). Despite this
benefit, the main goals for family leave and childcare poli-
cies are to help low-to-middle income families become more
self-sufficient, and limit the demand that requires cash-assis-
tance welfare programs (Franke, 2001).
Caring for Elders
Eldercare is a growing national concern. Eldercare addresses
such diverse needs as preparing meals, assisting with per-
sonal hygiene, providing medical care, transportation, shop-
ping, housekeeping, making appointments, managing
financial affairs, and offering companionship (Pearce &
Kuhn, 2009). Although protecting parents' ability to take
leave for pregnancy or child health remains an important
aspect of FMLA, eldercare is an issue that has received little
attention in legislation since 1993. Although the FMLA pro-
vides that "an eligible employee shall be entitled to . . . leave
. . . [i]n order to care for the spouse, or son, daughter, or par-
ent, of the employee," the plain language of the statute pro-
vides little guidance on the meaning of the phrase "to care
Arellano 3
for." As a result, management, employers, and courts look to
the U.S. Department of Labor's FMLA Regulations for
guidance.
The U.S. Department of Labor (2014) regulations discuss
what it means for an employee to be needed to care for a fam-
ily member:
(a) The medical certification provision that an employee is
"needed to care for" a family member or covered servicemember
encompasses both physical and psychological care. It includes
situations where, for example, because of a serious health
condition, the family member is unable to care for his or her own
basic medical, hygienic, or nutritional needs or safety, or is
unable to transport himself of herself to the doctor. The term also
includes providing psychological comfort and reassurance,
which would be beneficial to a child, spouse, or parent with a
serious health condition who is receiving in-patient or home
care.
(b) The term also includes situations where the employee may
be needed to substitute for others who normally care for a family
member or covered servicemember, or to make arrangements
for changes in care, such as transfer to a nursing home. (p. 823)
The emergence of eldercare is tied both to the advance-
ment in medical science that enables people with health
problems to live longer, and to the growing percentage of the
American elder population. Currently, nearly 20% of those
above the age of 65 need help with the basic activities of
daily living. Similarly, it is projected that by 2050 up to 20%
of the American population will be above the age of 65
(Congressional Budget Office, 2013).
Due to this increase in the elder population, many families
are also under pressure to meet the needs of eldercare while
also meeting the demands of their respective careers. The
majority of elders live in general population, assisted not in
homes or facilities, with family members providing the
majority of their care (Span, 2013). Only 5% of U.S. elders
are institutionalized, and of those 5%, 90% are disabled
elders in nursing homes, but receive informal care from rela-
tives and friends. Many of the formal facilities such as
assisted living and nursing homes provide inadequate, costly
facilities and eldercare (Span, 2013).
American families do not all proceed with eldercare in the
same way. For example, as a result of decades of immigra-
tion, many intergenerational transnational family members
living in the United States are continuously navigating
between the notions of eldercare described in the FMLA, and
their own cultural understandings of caring for elders. Family
members across generations reconstruct "rules of reciproc-
ity" to facilitate the application of ethnic traditions regarding
aging and geriatric care in the context of family separation
and dislocation (Sun, 2012).
In an ethnographic study on Taiwanese immigrants in the
United States, Ken C. Sun (2012) writes, "Given that
Taiwanese immigrants cannot provide hands-on physical
care for their elderly parents halfway around the world, both
these immigrants and their parents in Taiwan place more
emphasis on the emotional dimension of filial piety" (p.
1253). Consequently, families of immigrants may equate vis-
iting as a form of care. Employers that emphasize demanding
hours and erratic shifts as the norm, such as in the hospitals
and factories, may require employees to limit their care to
visiting time with their elders.
Childcare and the Costs Associated
Maternity leave is also an important issue for Americans.
The issue of paid leave for family care or childbirth is one
that is almost equally favorable to republicans, democrats,
and independents alike (Deng, 2014). Studies have shown
that parents with reliable childcare are better able to get and
maintain jobs and are able to work longer hours and earn
more money (National Women's Law Center, 2013).
Although childcare affects most families economically, low-
income families spend a larger portion of income on child-
care (Dinan, 2009).
When both parents work outside the home, it is impera-
tive that other arrangements are made for childcare. Many
working parents choose professional childcare centers, but
they are often unaffordable. High-quality private centers
charge US$20 to US$50 per day (or US$300 to US$1,000
per month; Cox, 2013). The average monthly income for a
family making less than US$1,500 per month was US$938 in
2010, accounting for 49.5% of which was spent on childcare
(Glynn, 2012). Similarly, existing federal tax policies, such
as the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, most likely
benefit middle-income families, instead of the low-income
families (Tax Policy Center, 2010). For all working parents,
they would need to arrange childcare in order to return to
work at a reasonable time after childbirth or adoption. As a
result, seeking institutional day care may create setbacks
such as waiting lists or other requirements. Paid family leave
may assist families to offset costs for childrearing and
childcare.
FMLA and the Need for Family-
Friendly Workplaces
On February 5, 1993, President William J. Clinton signed the
FMLA into law to provide job protection for certain employ-
ees faced with serious illnesses, and/or caregiving responsi-
bilities. The FMLA entitles certain covered employees to
take 12 weeks of job-protected, unpaid leave for the birth of
a son or daughter, the adoption of a child, or placing a child
in foster care; to care for a spouse, son, daughter, or parent
with a serious health condition; and to care for one's own
serious health condition when the condition interferes with
the employee's ability to perform at work. An employee is
guaranteed their previous position or a similar one when
returning to work.
4 SAGE Open
Although the FMLA was signed into law as a victory for
gender-neutral policy (Bhushan, 2012), the work­family
lifestyle has changed immensely since the 20 years that the
FMLA was passed. Americans quickly learned that the 12
weeks of unpaid leave that FMLA provides is not always
enough to care for their loved ones (Silbaugh, 2004). Even
among families with two parents, who each work full-time,
the demand to create schedules that fit their needs or meet
income levels that cover costs have proven very difficult.
Inadequate child support and other income transfers are often
economically insufficient for single parents with full-time
careers (Dowd, 2004).As women are more likely to leave the
workplace to have and care for children, as well as take care
of an ailing parent, they continue to be disadvantaged in the
workplace (Ali, 2009). One quarter of the best employers for
working mothers provide 4 or fewer weeks of maternity
leave, and half provide 6 weeks or less. Even the highest
grossing companies do not provide adequate leave for work-
ing mothers (Lovell, O'Neill, & Olsen, 2007).
The numerous setbacks to family-friendly policies begin
with how the FMLA is implemented against the pervasive
normative family values considered in U.S. Federal policies
affecting the family. The beginning of normative pro-family
values crept into public discourse when President Ronald
Reagan signed Executive Order 12606 in 1987. Executive
Order 12606 called for the Executive Branch to consider the
following questions "in formulative and implementing poli-
cies and regulations" of the federal government:
(a) [d]oes this action by government strengthen or erode the
stability of the family and, particularly, the marital commitment?
(b) [d]oes this action strengthen or erode the authority and rights
of parents in the education, nurture, and supervision of their
children?
(c) [d]oes this action help the family perform its functions, or
does it substitute governmental activity for the function?
(d) [d]oes this action by government increase or decrease family
earnings?
As a result of Executive Order 12606, the Federal
Government has crafted its policies and regulations with the
idea of normative family values in mind. However, Executive
Order 12606 in fact ignores the concerns of the family.
Senator Walter Mondale (1973) stated, "[t]o envision a sin-
gle family model or a single way to raise children would do
great damage to the pluralism and diversity that makes our
country strong."
The implications of the FMLA are not far from reinforc-
ing the traditional family values of the Reagan administra-
tion that discouraged women from entering the workforce by
reinforcing stereotypical gender roles within the home and
marketplace (Maril, 2013). The FMLA reinforces the
antiquated family view that men are breadwinners, and
women can take unpaid leave because their income is not as
essential to the family's livelihood.Although the FMLAdoes
not explicitly state the likely gender of the employee that will
request leave, the eligibility requirements and the nature of
caregiving in society often reflect the notion that women are
most likely to request FMLA leave if they are eligible
(Williams & Segal, 2003).
The structure of the FMLA assumes that women are more
financially and culturally available to take unpaid leave (Ali,
2009). To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must be
employed with the same employer for at least 12 months and
must have worked at least 1,250 hr in the prior year. In addi-
tion, an employer must have at least 50 employees to be cov-
ered. If there are multiple worksites, employees within a
75-mile radius are included in the total count. In 1996, 65.5
million workers were ineligible and 47.3 million employees
were ineligible because their employer had less than 50
employees. The remaining 18.3 million employees were
ineligible because they failed to meet the required number of
months or hours (U.S. Department of Labor, 1996). As a
result, almost half of all full-time workers in the United
States have no job-protected leave (Boushey, Farrell, &
Schmitt, 2013). Opponents of the FMLA have argued that
unpaid leave and eligibility restrictions undervalue because
FMLA assumes that women can afford to take leave because
their incomes are not as essential (Ali, 2009).
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. Department of Labor
published revised regulations that removed an employee's
ability to use accrued paid leave as a substitute for FMLA
leave (U.S. Department of Labor, 2008). Previously, the lan-
guage in the FMLA specified that an employee may elect, or
an employer may require the employee, to substitute any of
the accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave, or family
leave of the employee for leave provided under the Act.
Although critics have argued that the interpretation of the
regulation allowing substitution created incentives for
employees not to work, the overwhelming response from
employees and the general public illustrated that the substi-
tution only further disadvantaged employees who are in
workplaces without paid leave benefits. Opponents of the
2008 amendments have argued that the ability to substitute
accrued vacation or personal leave for paid FMLA leave is
useless if employees have to comply with their employers'
policies, such as documentation and notice requirements.
This procedural hurdle in using accrued vacation or personal
leave requires employees to bid for vacation time up to a year
in advance.
State Programs as Models for National
Reform
The FMLA sets the minimum requirements that must be
complied with, but allows state laws to provide greater
Arellano 5
protection for employees. The absence of paid leave has
impaired the ability of the FMLA to further its goals of help-
ing employees balance the demands of the workplace with
the needs of their families. Therefore, several states, such as
California, New Jersey, Washington, and Rhode Island, have
implemented or proposed some form of paid leave
legislation.
Regulations that affect workers and families often begin
at the state level. Although the Federal Government plays a
main role in regulating the relationships among workers,
employers, and unions, state governments have the power to
establish greater protections because states have the ability
to set labor policies in both the public and private sector as
long as the policies do not interfere with established Federal
laws and regulations (Collins, 2014). In addition, state laws
regarding fault and no fault divorce had an impact on whether
families stay together (Ellman, Kurtz, Scott, Weithorn, &
Bix, 2004). Because family leave policies affect children and
often affect marriages, the care that children receive from
family members is intertwined with state policies. The stabil-
ity and continuity of an employee's job affects stress levels in
the home, the quality of caregiving and the employee's pro-
ductivity at work.
Four states have implemented paid family leave policies
that draw their funds from state disability insurance funds,
payroll, and other wage replacement models. The states with
fully implemented policies are California, New Jersey,
Connecticut, and Rhode Island. There are ongoing efforts to
implement a form of paid family leave in Washington State.
These states can serve as models for federal legislation.
Furthermore, some states have responded to the FMLA's
strict eligibility requirements and have passed legislation
that covers employers with less than 50 employees and pro-
vided job-protected paid sick leave. See Table 1which pro-
vides an overview of states that have implemented a form of
paid leave in comparison to existing Federal Law.
The Moore-Roberti California Family Rights Act
(CFRA)
Before the FMLA was passed in 1993, California enacted the
Moore-Roberti CFRA which provided similar protections to
the current FMLA. The state was ahead of the game again in
2002, when it became the first state to adopt a wage replace-
ment requirement for parents to bond with a newborn or
adopted child. Governor Gray Davis signed Senate Bill 1661

The federal FMLA allows a worker to take leave to care for a new child or to care for a parent, a spouse, or a child under the age of 18
(or older if the child qualifies as a person with a disability) with a serious health condition. In 2008, the FMLA was amended to allow for
26 weeks of leave for military family members caring for wounded servicemembers. For this military family expansion, the definition of
"family" has been increased to include next of kin. However, the leave remains unpaid.

that put forth the comprehensive paid family leave program
that uses State Disability Insurance as its funding source.
California employees are afforded the right to 6 weeks of
partially paid family leave to care for a newborn, an adoptive
child, or a seriously ill family member regardless of the size
of the employer. Payout is equivalent to 55% of wages
funded by a mandatory employee payroll tax, which funds
up to US$882 per week. (Mesirow Financial, 2007). It pro-
vides the financial benefit for families that require that paid
time off. However, an employee's job may be protected if the
employer is subject to the federal FMLA. As a result, the
plan is an addition to the paid protection for the employees
who would be otherwise eligible for unpaid family leave. In
addition, California provides school-related parental leave,
which allows up to 40 hr per year, but no more than 8 hr per
month to participate in children's educational activities.
Unlike the FMLA, the California paid family leave allows
employees to care for a domestic partner, stepparent, or the
child of a domestic partner. Although California's workable
wage replacement system is efficient and effective, it also
has some disadvantages. The California Paid Family Leave
provides wage replacement during leave, but does not pro-
vide job protection during the leaves or the right to return to
the same position after leave (Cohen, 2011).
The New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA) and
Family Leave Insurance
In 2009, New Jersey enacted a similar program to California
called the NJFLA in which employees may be eligible to pay
a capped amount into their temporary disability insurance for
up to two thirds of their income. The New Jersey program
covers up to 6 weeks of family leave. To establish a valid
family leave claim, an individual must have employment
with a New Jersey covered employer and earn a certain
amount of wages. To be covered an employee must earn is
either US$145 or more per week during 20 calendar weeks in
the base year or US$7,300 or more during the base year
(New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce
Development, 2014). An individual can claim Family Leave
Insurance benefits to bond with a newborn child during the
first 12 months after the child's birth or after the child's
placement in adoption cases (New Jersey Department of
Labor and Workforce Development, 2014).
The Family Leave Insurance plan allows an employee,
the employee's spouse, domestic partner, or partner in civil
union to be the biological parent of the child. The New Jersey
Division on Civil Rights enforces the NJFLA, which requires
covered employers to grant eligible employees time off from
work in connection with the birth or adoption of a child or
the serious illness of a parent, child, or spouse (New Jersey
Department of Labor and Workforce Development, 2014).
The NJFLA's definition of "parent" encompasses stepparents
and parent in laws. The NJFLA differs from the FMLA in
that it covers employee leave for 12 weeks in a 24-month
period. Coverage may be paid, unpaid, or a combination. The
NJFLA does not allow an employee to use leave time for his
or her own medical condition, but one can use the protections
under the FMLA for those purposes if the employee is eligi-
ble. The NJFLA also applies to companies with 50 or more
employees nationwide, instead of within a 75-mile radius in
the FMLA. According to the New Jersey Department of
Labor and Workforce Development, between July 2009 and
March 2012, New Jersey's paid family leave program was
used more than 60,000 times by parents caring for new chil-
dren (National Partnership for Women & Families, 2012b).
However, similar to the California program, New Jersey
does not offer job protection to workers who take paid family
leave under the state's programs. This leaves with the possi-
bility of not being able to return to their jobs. As a result,
there may be an increased risk of job loss for individuals who
end up taking paid leave.
Rhode Island Paid Family Leave
On July 24, 2013, Governor Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island
signed into law a bill effective January 2014, that provides
working families with income when they have a new child or
need to care for a seriously ill family member. Rhode Island's
program, known as The Temporary Caregiver Insurance
Program is financed by an employee payroll deductions that
will provide 4 weeks of paid leave for family care needs,
which goes into the employee's temporary disability insur-
ance. Unlike the California paid leave plan, Rhode Island
provides an employee who takes under this program to return
to their position with equivalent seniority, status, benefits,
and pay.
Employees will be able to collect benefits for "any week
in which he or she is unable to perform his or her regular and
customary work" due to bonding with a newborn child or
adopted child or caring for a child, parent, parent-in-law,
grandparent, spouse, or domestic partner who has a serious
health condition. The Temporary Caregiver Insurance law
defines "serious health condition" as "any illness, injury,
impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves
inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, residential health care
facility, or continued treatment or continuing supervision by
a licensed health care provider." To receive temporary dis-
ability insurance benefits, employees must both file an appli-
cation with the Department of Labor and Training and
provide their employer with written notice of their intent to
take a leave of absence for at least 30 days prior to leave. An
employee's failure to provide notice may delay or reduce
benefits, unless the leave was unforeseeable. In 2014, the
Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training issued the
form of the notice. Rhode Island also allows parental leave
for up to 10 hr annually to participate in children's educa-
tional activities.
Arellano 7
Washington State's Family Care Act
In 2007, Washington State passed the Family Care Act which
will provide parents with weekly paid leave benefits for up to
5 weeks in the event of childbirth, adoption, or to care for a
seriously ill domestic partner, spouse, or parent. This pro-
gram is similar to the FMLAin the way it defines "employer"
and "covered employees." Unlike the California, New Jersey,
or Rhode Island plans, the lawmakers still have not decided
how they will finance the program, and thus, it has not been
fully implemented (Richard, 2013).
Washington's approach to paid leave would be to provide
a flat rate of US$250 a week. However, Washington does not
have a temporary disability insurance program to build from.
Proponents for the plan argue that a payroll tax may be an
appropriate funding mechanism. An employer is not required
to provide employment benefits while an employee is on
leave, but there are certain important exceptions. Benefits
like vacation time, sick leave, and retirement benefits gener-
ally do not continue to accrue during an employee's leave.
However, an employer cannot deny or eliminate employ-
ment benefits that had already accrued before the employee
took FMLA leave.

Connecticut has implemented the CT FMLA, a state law that
is similar to the Federal FMLA, but contains greater protec-
tions. Employees who qualify for the CT FMLA are entitled
to 16 weeks of job-protected leave, in a span of 24 months,
rather than 12 weeks. The CT FMLA requires employers
with 75 or more employees to provide job-protected leave
(Georgetown University Law Center, 2010). In 2012,
Governor Malloy passed legislation that allows employees
who work in public jobs in Connecticut to earn paid sick
leave that can be used toward caring for a seriously ill child
or spouse or even his own illnesses or health conditions. The
law enables pregnant women to use paid sick leave to seek
prenatal or postnatal care. In addition, the law states that a
service worker shall be entitled to the use of accrued paid
sick leave upon the completion of the service worker's 680th
hr of employment. However, a service worker is not entitled
to the use of accrued paid sick if the employee did not work
an average of 10 or more hours a week for the employer in
the most recent calendar year. The CT FMLA law even
allows the employee to use paid sick leave if he or she is a
victim of family violence or sexual assault.
Massachusetts Maternity Leave
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts provides greater leave
relating to pregnant employees regardless of marital status.
The law applies to employers with six or more workers.
According to the law, every full-time female employee is
entitled to at least 8 weeks of maternity leave if she complies
with the following conditions:
a. she has completed an initial probationary period set by
her employer which does not exceed 6 months or in
the event the employer does not utilize a probationary
period for the position in question has been employed
for at least 3 consecutive months and;
b. employee gives 2 weeks'notice of her expected depar-
ture date and notice that employee intends to return to
the job.
Unlike the FMLA, the 3 months tenure makes it easier for
women to start new jobs and still get job protection upon
maternity leave.
Although Massachusetts is considered generally to be a
progressive state with progressive social policies, the draft-
ers of this bill left much to be desired. One aspect missing is
the Massachusetts Leave Act does not apply to male employ-
ees. The Act was recently amended to provide leave for
adoptive mothers but not to male counterparts. In addition,
Massachusetts Maternity Leave can count simultaneously as
FMLA leave. However, employers cannot require employees
to use accrued time off such as vacation, sick, and personal
days during a maternity leave. Maternity leave under the
Massachusetts Act is available "at the time of birth or adop-
tion," but not "substantially earlier or substantially later." As
a result, time off due to pregnancy-related complications or
illness would not count against an employee's 8-week mater-
nity leave entitlement.
California, Rhode Island, and New Jersey are the only
states that provide paid family leave insurance for employees
who require time off for caregiving (Bravo, 2013).According
to the National Partnership for Women and Families' Dads
Expect Better article, other states such as Washington,
Oregon, and Maine have expanded access to unpaid, job-
protected leave beyond the FMLA (National Partnership for
Women & Families, 2012a). Finally, According to the
National Partnership for Women and Families' website on
Current Sick Day Laws, Connecticut, Washington, and D.C.
are the only jurisdictions that guarantee the right to earn paid
sick leave (National Partnership for Women & Families,
2014). As the data show, an employee's access to better
work­life conditions to meet the needs of his or her family
depends upon where that employee lives in the United States.
Consequently, there is an inequity with regard to family
leave access within the United States.
Advanced Work/Family Policies in
Other Countries
As many studies have shown, work­life balance policies in
the United States is inadequate compared with the rest of the
world. According to the National Partnerships for Women

Asians have the most generous paid leave laws.
Maternity Leave Benefits Outside of the United
States
Many countries outside of the United States have interest in
making sure families with childcare responsibilities are
financially sound. In 2010, the International Labor
Organization; (ILO, 2012) conducted Convention No. 183,
which reviewed maternity leave policies of ILO member
states and determined that out of 167 countries, 97% provide
money to women during maternity leave. According to
Article 6 of the Convention, cash benefits shall be provided,
in accordance with national laws and regulations, or in any
other manner consistent with national practice, to women
who are absent from work on leave. Article 6 further pro-
vides the following:
Cash benefits shall be at a level, which ensures that the woman
can maintain herself and her child in proper conditions of health
and with a suitable standard of living. Where practicable, and
after consultation with the representative organizations of
employers and workers, the cash benefits to which a woman is
entitled during leave should be raised to the full amount of the
woman's previous earnings or of such of those earnings as are
taken into account for the purpose of computing benefits.
The ILO suggests that paid benefits to parents with mater-
nity or paternity leave should be equivalent to at least two
thirds of their earnings for a minimum of 14 weeks (ILO,
2012). In the report, the United States, Lesotho, Papua New
Guinea, and Swaziland were the only countries without a
general legal provision of cash benefits for maternity leave
(ILO, 2012). See Table 2 for a summary of family leave
polices in some G20 countries in 2014.
To finance maternity leave, countries develop an insur-
ance pool from social security, employer liability, or a mix of
both. Social security systems include health or unemploy-
ment insurance, and public funds, derived from municipali-
ties, states, or governments. These systems use contributions
from a combination of employees, employers, and govern-
ment revenues to create an insurance pool to finance mater-
nity leave. Financing maternity benefits through social
security systems is the most common approach among Latin
American countries. The length of leave is the most common
gap of the three provisions in this region. Although many
Latin American countries provide 100% of prior earnings, 14
countries fall short of the 14-week standard in Convention
No. 183. Five countries in South America provide less than
14 weeks of leave and pay less than two thirds of prior earn-
ings (ILO, 2012).
Similar to the provisions in the FMLA with regard to
employee eligibility, many countries exclude domestic work-
ers and highly compensated executives from their cash bene-
fits and maternity leave programs. South Africa is an
Arellano 9
exception; they provide cash benefits and maternity leave to
its domestic workers, agricultural workers, and casual/tempo-
rary workers (ILO, 2012). To provide optimal maternity pro-
tection, more countries should seek to include all the aspects
of Convention No. 183 in their legislation for their citizens.
Parental Leave
Due to the effects of globalization on the workforce in the
United States, paid leave is critical to consider for the coun-
try to compete for the top qualified workers. In many coun-
tries, there is a growing consideration for both men and
women to take parental leave. Women receive a guaranteed
16 weeks of paid maternity leave. In Spain, mothers can take
16 weeks of paid maternity leave, and have the option to
transfer 10 weeks leave to the father (Gornick, Ray, &
Schmitt, 2009). In Sweden, mothers receive 16 weeks of
maternity leave, parents combined can take a total of 18
months for parental leave. In Norway, maternal leave is com-
pensated for up to 42 weeks, and the United Kingdom pro-
vides at least 5 weeks of paid leave (Clearinghouse on
International Developments in Child, Youth, and Family
Policies, 2003). In France, parents may share 156 weeks of
paid leave (3 years of leave; Clearinghouse on International
Developments in Child, Youth, and Family Policies, 2003).
The paid benefits are set at a flat rate of the equivalent to
US$462 per month for second and subsequent children. In
Germany, parents are allowed 14 weeks of paid leave and
they can be paid during part-time employment for 30 hr per
week. (Clearinghouse on International Developments in
Child, Youth, and Family Policies, 2003). Parents in Canada
can share 35 weeks of paid parental leave (combined mater-
nity of 15 weeks and cannot exceed 50 weeks (Government
of Canada, 2014). Further, places such as South Korea,
Indonesia, and Russia have implemented full pay for a span
of 84 to 140 days of parental leave (Hall & Spurlock, 2013).
Proposals for Change
Discussions surrounding paid family leave have been in the
works among many legislators and research organizations.
One of the ways to achieve better workplace conditions for
Americans and superior social policies that encourage the
health and wellbeing of family relationships is to provide
quality childcare and eldercare that is affordable in addition
to the cash benefits that have been proposed the ILO and
some states. Legislation needs to be created to expand paid
leave to all employees and executives. Below are some sug-
gestions that have been proposed by legislators and
professionals.
The Family Act, 2013
In 2013, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and
Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut sponsored
proposed legislation known as the Family and Medical
Insurance Leave Act--"Family Act"--which will provide a
funding mechanism for the FMLA (Gillibrand, 2013). The
bill will create a national insurance collection to provide par-
tial income for up to 12 weeks of leave for an employee's
pregnancy, recovery from childbirth, care for a child, parent,
spouse, domestic partner, or one's own serious health condi-
tion. The insurance program would be administered through
a newly created office called the Office of Paid Family and
Medical Leave, within the Social Security Administration.
Unlike the FMLA, this program will cover workers regard-
less of their employer size. As a result, it recognizes that
more than half the population works for a small business and
that these workers should be entitled to receive leave to care
for their families just like employees of large businesses
(Gillibrand, 2013). This program would be funded through
employee and employer payroll taxes which would cost
approximately US$1.50 per week for the average employee
(National Partnership for Women & Families, 2013). Benefit
levels, modeled after existing successful state programs in
New Jersey and California, would equal 66% of an individu-
al's typical monthly wages up to a capped monthly amount
that would be indexed for inflation (Gillibrand, 2013).
Although the Family Act is a proposed legislation, it has the
potential to implement paid family leave in the United States.
Social Security Cares Act
Heather Boushey of the Center for American Progress estab-
lished a proposal for Social Security reform to provide paid
family leave insurance known as Social Security Cares. This
program is similar in the way social security benefits are
given to an employer who pays into the program using his or
her wages and salary (O'Leary, Chayt, & Weissman, 2012).
Social Security Cares will be an insurance program run by
each state in which benefits will supplement family income
sufficiently to allow workers to take time off. Boushey's pro-
posal also emphasizes the benefits of Social Security Cares
to younger workers, who will have the ability to access the
system early, which will provide incentive to continue to
work hard until retirement (O'Leary et al., 2012).
Social Security's capacity to continue to provide retire-
ment benefits for future generations is critically important.
Heather Boushey suggests Social Security Cares will not add
significant expenses to the system and will strengthen the
Social Security system by increasing the labor supply of
mothers, workers with health problems, and workers who
need to care for those with chronic or serious health prob-
lems, while further increasing tax revenues to the system
overall (Boushey & Glynn, 2012). The Social Security Cares
Act will expand the qualifying criteria to include domestic
partners of employees (O'Leary et al., 2012).
A combination of changes to the FMLA as well as the
Social Security Cares has the potential to benefit all workers
in the United States. Protecting families as well as incentivizing
10 SAGE Open
work are two values that will create a diverse and thriving
workforce.
Paid Leave in Every State With Job-Protection
After Leave
The right to return to one's job is imperative for employees.
Congress intended for employee's, who need leave to care
for their family, to have the ability to return to their jobs
under the FMLA. The type of paid leave should help to
improve the quality of life for women and families, but not
be too generous that it encourages lengthy absences from the
workforce (Lester, 2005). Twenty-one states have introduced
bills to expand their unemployment insurance programs to
provide wage replacement to parents following the birth or
adoption of a child. In addition, several states are considering
bills that would expand existing temporary disability insur-
ance programs or create new public insurance schemes.
States with successful paid leave programs have shown the
importance of crafting legislation with appropriate funding
mechanisms and creating lag for families without the right
process. The trends from these states prove that paid leave is
attainable (Lester, 2005).
To successfully meet its stated goals and objectives, the
FMLA should be amended to require paid parental leave and
mandate each state to provide its own funding mechanisms.
Each state is capable of instituting its own needs without
interfering with Federal policies. States know best what their
employees need and should be allowed to make decisions
concerning how much paid leave is available for its workers.
The FMLA should provide minimum requirements that
states must meet. However, states should be given the oppor-
tunity to exceed those minimum requirements.
Extend Coverage to Grant Leave for the Care of
Any Relative
Leave should be broad to encompass all relatives. Today,
families are blended and are not always of the traditional,
nuclear composition that is protected by the language of
Executive Order 12606. For many families, the need to care
for an aunt or uncle may be equally as important as the need
to care for one's own ailing parent. Similarly, grandparents
often fall between the status of in loco parentis and the typi-
cal grandparent relationship (American Jurisprudence Proof
of Facts, 2012). Accordingly, these relationships should be
protected under the Act or the proposed new legislation
addressing the nature of various family dynamics. Family
policymakers need to consider and engage all types of fami-
lies (Maril, 2013). Until a national legislation passes recog-
nizing same-sex partnerships, the definition of spouse should
include those who are married legally by a state, and should
also cover civil unions and domestic partnerships. The
FMLA should be amended to allow same-sex relationships
to achieve equal access to childbirth and childcare for their
families.
Paternal Leave Campaigns
Men in the workplace are less likely than women to leave the
workforce to care for families. The United States is lagging
behind other countries that emphasize the importance of the
paternal role in caregiving for many families. Although the
demographics of families have changed over the past
decades, most men in heterosexual households have not
changed their workdays to accommodate for parenting.
Survey results report that women are more likely to take
FMLA leave as they constituted 58.1% of those who took
leave in 2000 when women comprised only 48.7% of all eli-
gible employees in a population (Selmi & Cahn, 2006).
According to the National Partnerships for Women and
Families' Expecting Dads paper, only 14 states and the
District of Columbia provide laws that expand beyond the
FMLA for expecting fathers (National Partnership for
Women & Families, 2013). Future campaigns that empha-
size paid leave should not force women to be the ones taking
breaks from the workforce. It should be just as important to
provide policies that allow working men to also have the
ability to leave the workforce to care for a loved one.
Expand Definitions of Employer
The FMLA's current eligibility requirements leave many
low-wage and part-time workers uncovered. One solution to
expand FMLA coverage for these workers is to amend the
coverage for employees and employers. Under the proposed
reform to FMLA, employers with 15 or more employees will
have to comply with FMLA. As it stands, the FMLA only
recognizes employers with 50 or more employees. Although
having all employers eligible under this plan is ideal, the
easiest solution would be to align the requirement to that of
already existing employment related laws. For example, hav-
ing 15 or more employees comply with FMLA aligns with
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans
With Disabilities Act. In addition, the proposal to reform
should be explicit in providing coverage for part-time
employees, and therefore will reduce the number of hours
needed to be worked to gain eligibility.
Funding Mechanisms That Directly Affect
Childcare and Eldercare Costs
Although this article primarily promotes paid family leave
policies, upcoming legislation should consider social policies
that deal with maintaining available childcare and eldercare
after leave periods expire. After paid family leave and afford-
able health insurance are implemented in the marketplace, the
various funding mechanisms in which employees pay into
Arellano 11
their childcare or eldercare or are matched by their employers
with considerable revenue can provide additional support to
families. Economists suggest that childcare policies should
allow for parents to choose high-quality care (Blau, 2002).
According to the Center for the Child Care Workforce, 2.3
million paid childcare workers care for children aged 0 to 5
years. The populations that need the most assistance with
childcare and who also need to get back in the workforce are
often stifled by current childcare policies. For example, cur-
rent funding programs provide benefits for working parents
and parents who are in school or participating in some formal
training. However, the parents who are unemployed or
underemployed may not qualify for childcare assistance
(Gardner, Martin, Holod, Johnson, & Brooks-Gunn, 2009).
No Documentation Requirement
According to Frequently Asked Questions and Answers
About the Revisions to the Family and Medical Leave Act
report by the U.S. Department of Labor (2009), an employee
is not required to give the employer his or her medical
records. The employer, however, does have a statutory right
to request that an employee provide medical certification
containing sufficient medical facts to establish that a serious
health condition exists. Under the regulations, employers
may contact an employee's health care provider for authenti-
cation or clarification of the medical certification by using a
health care provider, a human resource professional, a leave
administrator, or a management official. To address employee
privacy concerns, the rule makes clear that in no case may
the employee's direct supervisor contact the employee's
health care provider (U.S. Department of Labor, 2009).
Employees and their families must be able to establish a
sense of privacy when requesting leave. Currently under the
law, it is the employer's discretion when to request medical
certification. Although this is legally appropriate, it seems
superfluous when an employee can establish the proper
notice to his or her employer about the need for time off.
Employees should be treated in a manner which respects
their decisions when it comes to taking leave to care for one-
self or other family members.
Conclusion
Given the situation of workers and families in the United
States, it has become clear that since 1993, taking unpaid
leave is a burden for many American families, especially
those with high levels of educational attainment who may
qualify under the FMLA, and elders who require ongoing
care. Although the FMLA does not place any restrictions on
the ability of states to enact more favorable and generous
policies, the states that do enact generous policies are paving
the way toward protecting employees and their families. One
solution for promoting long-term family and medical leave
would be to follow the countries that place a greater
emphasis on family values. Globalization and the economy
have affected our workforce as well as our families.
Revisiting the FMLA in the near future would prove fruitful
to strengthening the efforts of creating families, and allowing
women to lead in the workplace by finally offering them the
"peace of mind" once suggested to the nation.
Meaningful compromises must be made between advo-
cates for paid leave and employers. Despite the economic
differences, work­family policy making in the United States
must change from the status quo to truly enhance employees'
work­life relationships. The United States must prioritize
family policymaking over ineffective financial shortcuts that
compromise both families and employees.
