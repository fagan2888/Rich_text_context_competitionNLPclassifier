Introduction
The popularity of complementary and alternative medicine
(CAM) is growing among the general public, and in many
developed countries, its use varies from 70% to 80% (World
Health Organization, 2008). The National Center for
Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM, 2011)
defines CAM as a group of diverse medical and health sys-
tems, products, and practices that are not generally consid-
ered part of conventional medicine. Therefore,
complementary medicine refers to use of CAM together with
conventional medicine, and alternative medicine refers to its
use in place of conventional medicine (NCCAM, 2011).
The use of CAM is also growing among cancer patients
with an average use of 31.4% ranging from 7% to 64% (Ernst
& Cassileth, 1998). A study by Molassiotis et al. (2005)
reported that the use of CAM increased by 30% after the
cancer diagnosis. The most commonly reported CAM used
are natural products, such as herbs, vitamins, and minerals.
The use of homeopathy and relaxation techniques is also
commonly reported (Molassiotis et al., 2005).
CAM use has been associated to sociodemographic factors
because many studies have found that increased CAM use is
associated with female gender, higher levels of education, and
good income (Nguyen, Davis, Kaptchuck, & Philips, 2010;
Rosenberg et al., 2008). In addition to demographic charac-
teristics, the type of cancer and it's stage are two important
factors related to the use of CAM, and several studies suggest
breast cancer as one of the most associated with this use
(Adams, Sibbritt, & Young, 2005; Gansler, Kaw, Crammer, &
Smith, 2008; Molassiotis et al., 2005). The main reasons
given by breast cancer patients for the use of CAM consist in
the desire to improve the immune system, cure cancer (Boon
et al., 2000; Shen et al., 2002; Wanchai, Armer, & Stewart,
2010), alleviate symptoms associated with the side effects of
conventional treatments (Shen et al., 2002; Wanchai et al.,

Use of Complementary and Alternative
Medicine in a Sample of Women With
Breast Cancer
Mariana Vidal1, Cláudia Carvalho2, and Regina Bispo3
Abstract
This study aims to examine the usage of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) on a sample of Portuguese women
with history of breast cancer. A total of 107 women with history of breast cancer attending Movimento Vencer e Viver
Lisboa responded to a questionnaire designed to assess the use of CAM, as well as other variables, such as satisfaction with
conventional care, health perception, perceived control over cancer, and health status (body mass index [BMI], smoking and
alcohol consumption, hours of sleep, and physical activity). Forty-eight percent of the participants had used some kind of
CAM in the past 12 months. The perceived control over cancer was significantly associated with CAM use (odds ratio [OR] =
1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.2, 1.9]). CAM use was more prevalent among women aged 30 to 39 years, single, with
high education, and a monthly income of 2,500 to 2,999. The CAM used most often were natural products, along with
psychotherapy, breathing exercises, and meditation. The main reason mentioned for its use was the improved sense of well-
being, and it was interesting to note that 60% of the participants who used CAM did not discuss it with their physicians. The
findings support previous data that suggest that the participants' perceived control over their cancer is a significant predictor
of CAM usage, and more than half of the patients did not discuss CAM usage with their physician. Further studies with larger
samples of cancer patients are warranted.

2010), enhance quality of life (Boon et al., 2000), increase the
perception of disease control (Wanchai et al., 2010), and
prevent relapse (Boon et al., 2000).
In the last decade patients began to have a more proactive
role in relation to their health and well-being, and the ability
to discuss about treatments, both conventional and alterna-
tive, with their health professionals is becoming increasingly
more important (Milden & Stokols, 2004). A study of Chang,
Brodie, Choong, Sweeney, and Kerin (2011) showed that
only 17.2% of the doctors confessed that they were able to
encourage their patients to use CAM. Most doctors say that
they do not have enough knowledge about the safety and
efficacy of these techniques but were interested in learning
more about it (Chang et al., 2011; Milden & Stokols, 2004).
It's important that physicians are aware of the side effects of
CAM, or about the possible interactions between substances
to advise the use of CAM when it presents to be beneficial,
or warn about the danger of its use when they present risks
for the health of the patient. Likewise, patients should be
encouraged to share this information with their health care
professionals through a conversation that should be per-
formed carefully and should be made to feel that they are
taken seriously and are not criticized for using CAM
(Werneke et al., 2004). A study conducted on women with
breast cancer showed that patients using herbal medicines or
other products of oral intake, with exception of homeopathy,
communicated to their doctor that they were using those sub-
stances, which indicates that they expect that the doctor
inform them about the potential risks. However, patients who
resorted to quiropraxis, yoga, guided imagery, hypnosis, and
acupuncture were least likely to inform their health profes-
sionals, perhaps, because they feel that these practices do not
present risk to the treatment they are under and also because
many doctors do not believe in these modalities (Shen et al.,
2002).
To our knowledge, in Portugal no study has explored
CAM use among cancer patients. The aim of the present
study is to examine CAM usage in a sample of Portuguese
women with history of breast cancer, in a comprehensive
way by examining its association through access to a general
practitioner,1 perceived satisfaction with conventional care,
health perception, suffering from other chronic diseases, and
perceived control over breast cancer.
Method
The data were obtained using a questionnaire based on two
sections from the International Questionnaire to Measure
Use of Complementary andAlternative Medicine (I-CAM-Q;
Quandt et al., 2009), which aims to internationally assess the
use of CAM. This questionnaire includes a set of questions
about visiting health care providers from traditional medi-
cine and alternative and complementary medicine.
Participants were asked to indicate the number of times the
providers were seen in the past 3 months, the main reason
they last saw each provider and how helpful the visit was.
The questionnaire included sociodemographic data (age,
marital status, education level, monthly income, and occupa-
tion); questions about access to a general practitioner, satis-
faction with conventional care, health perception, existence
of other chronic disease and perceived control over breast
cancer, by using an item from the Brief Illness Perception
Questionnaire (Broadbent, Petrie, Main, & Weinman, 2006)
that aims to access the belief that the patient has about the
possibility of their disease to be controlled and cured; and
health status (information on body mass index, smoking and
alcohol consumption, number of hours of sleep per night,
and physical activity practice). The sample was collected in
Movimento Vencer e Viver Lisboa (Reach to Recovery) in
Lisbon, Portugal. Participation was voluntary and partici-
pants did not receive any payment for participating in the
inquiry. Questionnaires were anonymous and no personal
information was asked for disclosure.
Statistical Analyses
Participants were classified according to the use of CAM in
the past 12 months, as "users" (defined as using CAM at
least once in the past 12 months) or "nonusers." The differ-
ences between CAM users and nonusers with respect to
sociodemographic, clinical, and health characteristics were
tested using a Pearson chi-square test or a Wilcoxon­Mann­
Whitney test depending on the scale measurement of the
variable. The use/nonuse of CAM was modeled using a
binary logistic regression as a function of the mentioned
variables. The odds ratio (OR) and the correspondent 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were determined to measure the
effect size for each variable while controlling the effect of
the other variables. Results were considered statistically sig-
nificant at p < .05.All data were analyzed using the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences, version 19.
Results
A total of 107 individuals participated in this study. Of these,
51 (47.7%) used some type of CAM in the past 12 months.
The most frequently used types of CAM were natural prod-
ucts (37.3%), psychotherapy (25.5%), breathing exercises
(19.6%), and meditation (15.7%; Table 1). The main reasons
mentioned for using CAM were to increase well-being (50%)
and to treat a long-term health condition (i.e., one that last
more than 1 month) or its symptoms (33%). Sixty-eight per-
cent of the alternative medicines mentioned were considered
very useful. Among CAM users, 60% reported that they did
not discuss the usage of CAM with their physicians.
The perceived control over the breast cancer disease was
found to be a significant (p = . 002) predictor of CAM use (OR
= 1.5; 95% CI = [1.2, 1.9]), where the probability of not using
CAM is about one and a half times higher in participants with
a greater perceived control over the disease. Also, perceived
Vidal et al. 3
control over the breast cancer disease showed significant dif-
ferences between users and nonusers (U = 833.5; W = 2,009.5;
p < .001), with nonusers reporting a higher perceived control
over the disease than users. There was no significant differ-
ence between users and nonusers with respect to age
(p = .296), marital status (p = .626), education (p = .236),
income (p = .251), occupation (p = .323), satisfaction with
conventional medicine (p = .775), health perception (p = .704),
having cancer in the past 12 months (p = .761), existence of
other chronic disease (p = .65), body mass index (p = .082),
smoking (p = .368), hours of sleep (p = .051), consumption of
alcohol (p = .265), and physical activity (p = .166).
Discussion
The observed rate of CAM usage found in this study (47.7%)
is within the range of results reported in previous studies
with breast cancer patients, varying from 35.9% (Molassiotis
et al., 2005) to 73% (Shen et al., 2002). The second relevant
finding is the difference found between users and nonusers
on perceived control over breast cancer, which is supported
by previous literature (e.g., Henderson & Donatelle, 2003).
In this study, despite the fact that no statistically significant
differences were found between CAM users and nonusers in
any of the sociodemographic variables assessed, we found
that in our sample, CAM usage was more frequent among
women aged 30 to 39 years, single, with high educational
levels and a monthly income ranging 2,500 to 2,999,
which concurs with the trend consistently reported by a num-
ber of previous studies (Chang et al., 2011; Conboy et al.,
2005; Rosenberg et al., 2008; Steinsbekk, Adams, Sibbritt, &
Johnsen, 2010). Natural products, psychotherapy, breathing
exercises, meditation, and homeopathy were among the most
commonly used CAM practices. These results are supported
by previous studies with cancer patients in which the most
reported CAM were natural products (Boon et al., 2000;
Molassiotis et al., 2005; Shen et al., 2002), followed by
homeopathy (Molassiotis et al., 2005; Steinsbekk et al.,
2010) and relaxation techniques (Molassiotis et al., 2005;
Wanchai et al., 2010).
Data also reveal that a high number of patients do not
report the use of CAM to their physician, confirming pre-
vious studies (Richardson, Sanders, Palmer, Greisinger, &
Singletary, 2000). According to Chang et al. (2011), this
lack of communication is associated with several factors,
namely, being afraid that the physician does not under-
stand or disapproves of the usage, and that physicians tend
to not ask the patient about CAM use. In an era where
patients attend to have a more proactive role in relation to
their health and their well-being, it is important that
patients and physicians are able to discuss either conven-
tional or alternative treatments to prevent its misuse, detri-
mental interactions, and enhancement of personal control
over disease.
Our study suggests that use of CAM is popular among
breast cancer patients and that some variables may signifi-
cantly explain the use of CAM. The small size of the col-
lected sample and its nonprobabilistic nature limits this
study's inference results; however, this study, with its limited
samples found similar results in previous reports on CAM
use with larger samples, suggesting that Portuguese breast
cancer patients behave in a similar way regarding CAM use,
than other international samples studied. Nevertheless fur-
ther studies in a larger representative Portuguese samples are
warranted.
