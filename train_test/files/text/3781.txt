Article
The main purpose of this study was to assess secondary pre-
service teachers' understanding of inquiry and inquiry
instruction. The secondary purpose was to discover what
educational-background variables reported in educational
research are significantly associated with this understanding.
In the course of this exploration, we determined that the lit-
erature did not contain an adequate measure of or coding sys-
tem for inquiry understanding. We, therefore, adapted a
published instrument for this purpose, focused on inquiry-
learning outcomes.
Inquiry and inquiry instruction have been part of substan-
tial teacher-education curriculum revision, especially but not
exclusively in the sciences (e.g., European Commission,
Directorate-General for Research, Directorate L--Science,
Economy and Society, 2007; National Council for the Social
Studies, 2010; National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,
2000; National Governors Association Center for Best
Practices, Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010;
National Research Council, 1996, 2012). No empirical study
has qualitatively and quantitatively explored secondary pre-
service teachers'understanding of inquiry and inquiry instruc-
tion from a constructivist learning view. Prospective secondary
teachers should acquire conceptual, situational, and proce-
dural knowledge of inquiry instruction in school subjects.
Such knowledge cannot only be conceptual to transform it into
strategies for learning how to inquire independently.
We inferred inquiry understanding separately from pre-
service teachers' definitions of inquiry and descriptions of
their best, self-selected, prior experience with inquiry
instruction as students. Definitions represented conceptual
knowledge of key conceptual elements of inquiry.
Descriptions represented tacit knowledge and awareness of
the experience-grounded concepts, situations, and proce-
dures that might help generate or elaborate inquiry-based
instruction.
Our central information source was the student-teachers
themselves who, in their own words, defined inquiry and
described what they had listed as the best example of inquiry
instruction they recalled from their formal education.
Literature Review
We found only one existing but unpublished instrument
(Curry-Sumrall, 2010) intended to directly measure teachers'
knowledge of inquiry and implementation of inquiry instruc-
tion, but its focus was on elementary schools, replies were

What Makes Inquiry Stick? The Quality of
Preservice Teachers' Understanding
of Inquiry
Mark W. Aulls1, Diana Tabatabai1, and Bruce M. Shore1
Abstract
This nonexperimental, exploratory, mixed-design study used questionnaires with 167 preservice secondary teachers
to identify prior educational experiences associated with student-teachers' inquiry understanding. Understanding was
determined through content analysis then open coding of definitions of inquiry and descriptions of best-experienced inquiry
instruction, in terms of 23 potential learner-inquiry outcomes. Only two of seven educational-context variables related to
understanding: prior experience doing a thesis or research--especially to definition quality and having taken a research-
methods course--especially to description quality. How definitions and descriptions of inquiry are different and similar was
analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Implications for methodology, theory, and practice were presented, for example,
research opportunities and research-methods training during teacher education.

grouped and categorized into internally diverse categories, and
data generated were focused on science and unrelated to other
variables. The inquiry literature about secondary teachers has
especially addressed science, even though secondary teacher
education includes specialists in many other subjects.
Therefore, creating a versatile, qualitative, and quantitative
indicator of preservice teachers' inquiry understanding
emerged as one of our goals, together with understanding how
student-teachers might gain insight into educational inquiry.
Inquiry teaching and learning have a long history that,
according to Kilbane and Milman (2013), dates from Ibn al-
Haytham's 11th-century Book of Optics. Inquiry instruction
refers to how to establish conditions that enable learners to
weave together disciplinary and interdisciplinary knowledge
and the processes of inquiry to construct relevant knowledge
(Aulls & Shore, 2008; National GovernorsAssociation Center
for Best Practices, Council of Chief State School Officers,
2010; United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
Organization [UNESCO], 2008). Inquiry necessarily actively
engages learners in acquiring and self-regulating inquiry-
relevant conceptual and procedural knowledge (Llewellyn,
2005). Typically, it also builds on links to individual interests
and knowledge. Although an inquiry approach to instruction
should contain these elements, it does not always do so with
consistent success (see multiple examples in Shore, Aulls, &
Delcourt, 2008) and it requires considerable planning and
deliberate effort on the part of both novice and expert teachers
(Reiff, 2002) at all levels of formal education.
Inquiry-based education is an important instructional
approach because it improves student-learning outcomes and is
valued by students. Furtak, Seidel, Iverson, and Briggs (2012)
conducted a meta-analysis of 37 experimental and quasi-
experimental science-education studies. Students from inquiry-
based classrooms outperformed students from traditional
classrooms on measures of conceptual understanding. Field,
Reis, and Sedam (2006) interviewed graduates of secondary
gifted-education programs that included at least one original,
inquiry-based project. Their most valued memories were about
participation in these projects. If inquiry experiences form
strong memories, then university students should be able to
recall and describe the most memorable ones. Concepts are
part of the declarative knowledge stored in memory and used to
define complex schema such as inquiry as a process or as an
instructional approach. Hence, we anticipated that describing
preservice teachers' understanding would entail addressing
both conceptual and experiential inquiry representations.
Teaching through inquiry is challenging because enactment
of inquiry curriculum is complex, can be done in a variety of
ways, and can be used for different lengths of time in a class-
room or course (Aulls, Kaur Magon, & Shore, 2015; Boyer
Commission on Educating Undergraduates in the Research
University, 1998; Davidson & Bruce, 1993; National Research
Council, 2012; Reiff, 2002; Strum Kenny et al., 2001;
Windschitl, 2002, 2008). A related challenge is understanding
and setting learning goals of inquiry instruction, given the
many operational definitions of inquiry.This, in part, prompted
the U.S. National Research Council (2012) to rethink and limit
its use of the term in the sciences and engineering.
Inquiry competence is built gradually and not always
smoothly (Aulls & Shore, 2008; Shore et al., 2008). Levy and
Petrulis (2012) asked 30 first-year, secondary education stu-
dents about their experience and understanding of inquiry and
research in relation to their overall university experience.
Despite excitement about content that interested them, they
experienced challenges in searching for information, adapting
personal learning beliefs, the capabilities to carry out inquiry
assignments, and coping with peer-collaboration dynamics.
Such learners' challenges likely also affect student-teachers.
Possible Correlates of Inquiry Understanding
We selected our educational-context or background variables
through an extensive cross-disciplinary search of the research
literature, including student-teachers'or teachers'understand-
ing or classroom use of inquiry. We conducted a second
search limited to education undergraduates. We identified the
following two conditions in student-teachers' learning histo-
ries that might especially correlate with the quality of their
inquiry understanding.
Taking a research-methods course. Formally teaching research
methods is common in some disciplines. We could not locate
research linking them to student-teachers' inquiry under-
standing, but we located a somewhat related dissertation.
Meijer (2007) compared 257 psychology undergraduates
regarding whether they had taken a research-methods course
and asked two questions about basic, nontechnical concepts
in psychological research methodology. Students who com-
pleted a research-methods course did significantly better, but
still made more than 50% errors.
Completing a thesis or a major or honors project.Research on
honors programs highlighted the importance of self-directed
and self-generated learning. Pruitt (2013) observed seven first-
and second-year honors students completing an independent,
open-ended literature project with the teacher as a facilitator
rather than authority figure. The experience encouraged stu-
dents to recognize knowledge gaps and construct their own
personally relevant knowledge. Crawford's (1999, 2007) men-
torship studies revealed the impact of student-teachers' prior
research experience on planning and enacting instruction.
Preservice Teachers' Understanding of Inquiry
Crawford (1999); Eick and Dias (2005); Eick and Reed
(2002); Grove, Dixon, and Pop (2009); and Windschitl (2002,
2004) studied implementation of inquiry during student-teach-
ing in secondary school or college. These studies collectively
suggested gaps in empirically derived knowledge about pre-
service teachers'understand of inquiry and inquiry instruction,
Aulls et al. 3
educational experiences associated with their understanding,
and how to design research for these purposes.
Aulls and Ibrahim (2010) randomly selected 21 of 175
preservice teachers' essays about what makes an effective
teacher, to explore whether effective instruction and effec-
tive inquiry instruction were understood as basically the
same or different. Although mostly not previously taught
through inquiry, they could distinguish between effective
general and effective inquiry instruction. In effective inquiry
instruction, student and teacher roles vary (Walker, Shore, &
Tabatabai, 2013), activities promote understanding, and
knowledge is co-constructed in group discussions. Thus,
student-teachers should be able to articulate important
inquiry qualities in conceptual definitions of the nature of
inquiry and in descriptive writing indicating what they have
experienced as inquiry instruction.
Demir and Abell (2010) used classroom observations and
semistructured interviews to study four beginning science
teachers' and two faculty members' inquiry understanding.
During their third interview, they asked, "In what ways if any
do you think your lesson used inquiry? Why?--or Why not?"
(p. 721). They confirmed earlier findings that teachers'
understanding of inquiry-based teaching is poorly aligned
with National Research Council (1996, 2000) definitions.
Again, this suggested a discrepancy between what profes-
sional educators and practicing teachers think inquiry is. In
addition, a multiple-case study of five secondary-science
teachers demonstrated that "teachers' conceptions of sci-
ence" and presumably, by extension, inquiry, "do not neces-
sarily influence classroom practice" (Lederman, 1999,
p. 916). Most preservice teachers found it difficult to bridge
subject-matter knowledge with pedagogy and to use content
knowledge in ways that help all students as inquirers.
Hayes (2002) analyzed 22 preservice teachers' writings
and reflective journals from one of his elementary science-
methods courses. Student-teachers' words illustrated strug-
gles defining three categories of meaning around which an
inquiry approach to teaching could be articulated: letting go,
going with students'interests, and asking the right questions.
Hayes addressed new teachers' emerging identities and roles
as they began their teaching practices; this differed from our
focus but it invoked an interesting methodology with great
attention paid to detailed descriptions, which we emulated.
Finally, prior research on preservice teachers' experience-
based understanding of inquiry instruction has mostly
addressed secondary-science instruction and largely ignored
other subjects. We included secondary preservice teachers
preparing to teach several subjects.
Measuring the Quality of Student-Teacher's
Understanding of Inquiry
Curry-Sumrall's (2010) eight-item Inquiry Definition
Checklist was the only existing instrument we found that
quantitatively evaluated inquiry definitions. Curry-Sumrall
directly questioned how 18 elementary school teachers
defined inquiry and why those who could define inquiry did
not necessarily teach with inquiry. The checklist addressed
making observations, asking questions, examining informa-
tion sources, investigation, reviewing what is known, data
manipulation (gather, analyze, interpret), offering answers,
and communicating results. If one to three items were pres-
ent, Curry-Sumrall evaluated the definition as "Does not
define inquiry," four to six as "Somewhat defines inquiry,"
and seven or eight as "Thoroughly defines inquiry." Multiple
regression revealed no significant relations with subject-
matter knowledge, education level, years of teaching,
school, socioeconomic level, or extent of inquiry implemen-
tation. The scale was likely insufficiently sensitive to finer
level differences in definitions, and the sample was small.
Martin-Hansen (2002) also examined inquiry definitions in
practicing teachers' secondary-science classrooms. She
described five essential features of an inquiry classroom:
learner engagement with questions, importance of evidence
responding to questions, formulating explanations from evi-
dence, connecting explanations to scientific knowledge, and
communication and explanations. These five qualities could
be among the criteria sought in any good definition of
inquiry. Therefore, we included developing a suitable evalu-
ation tool for student-teachers'inquiry understanding within
this study.
Method
We conducted a nonexperimental, exploratory, mixed-design
study (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007, 2011). In this design,
qualitative and quantitative data were collected concurrently.
A survey solicited quantitative inquiry-background data and
included two open-ended questions to be qualitatively ana-
lyzed. One question elicited definitions of what inquiry meant
to participants, and the second elicited a description of the best
inquiry instruction they reported having experienced during
their formal education from the descriptions provided.
Participants
The 167 preservice student-teacher volunteers were in two
sections of introductory educational psychology, within their
teacher-education program at a large, Canadian, research-
oriented university. They included 113 women (68%) and 54
men (32%) preparing to be secondary school teachers across
several teaching disciplines. Almost half (81, 49%) were in
English language arts or second language education as their
program concentration and 48 (29%) specialized in physical
education. Only 17 (10%) specialized in science, mathemat-
ics, or technology; 13 (8%) in social-science teaching; and
eight (5%) in the arts. All had high-school diplomas, 102
(61%) graduated from Quebec pre-university college pro-
grams, and 104 (62%) had less than 3 months of teaching
experience.
4 SAGE Open
Procedures
The university research ethics board approved the study.
After a research assistant described the study to the class,
seeking volunteers, the questionnaire was distributed to 175
preservice secondary teachers in two course sections taught
by one of the authors. Students started the questionnaire in
class where they could obtain clarification about the direc-
tions. They had 2 weeks to complete the survey outside class
time and were given course-participation credit for complet-
ing it on time. Eight questionnaires (5%) were incomplete,
and 167 completed questionnaires were analyzed.
Section A asked about their background, including having
done research or a thesis and having taken a research-methods
course. In Section B, we operationalized understanding
inquiry by requesting, "Please explain what `inquiry' means
to you from a student's point of view." In Section C, we asked
participants to separately describe in detail all occasions of
inquiry they could recall in their elementary, secondary, com-
munity college, and university education. Student-teachers
had space to name the grade level and subject and briefly
describe what happened in every example. Later they were
asked to "Go back (to the inquiry experiences listed) and
place an asterisk (*) in front of the example you consider the
best inquiry experience you had as a student."
Data Coding and Analyses
We first applied a deductive qualitative-analysis procedure by
Mayring (2000). Twenty-three conceptions of inquiry-learn-
ing outcomes in the McGill Inventory of Student Inquiry
Outcomes­Students (MISIO-S; Saunders-Stewart, Gyles, &
Shore, 2012), that had been criterion-referenced in the litera-
ture, were used to categorize noun and verb phrases in each
sentence of each definition and description. The items had
been selected from a literature review of research reporting
evidence of learning outcomes of inquiry instruction and of
existingmeasuresofinquiry-learningoutcomes.Operationally,
The term outcome was used to describe any change that is a
result of engagement in inquiry, for example, but not limited to,
learning content and skills, or changes in attitudes and
motivation. Some outcomes, for example, asking questions, are
part of the inquiry process, but outcomes such as heightened
curiosity and asking more or better questions also may be
evident. (Saunders-Stewart et al., 2012, p. 8)
Three items (4, 5, 6) addressing understanding were com-
bined. Two new items were added, for mentioning data col-
lection or doing research. The two left columns of Table 1 list
the 23 coding categories. We identified the modified
MISIO-S as MISIO-Sm.
The MISIO-Sm discriminated strong and weak inquiry
definitions and descriptions of approximately equal length
that had been selected by a panel from our research team
(Table 2). More MISIO-Sm categories were coded in the
stronger responses. Such discrimination was not observed
when we coded responses with instruments having fewer
inquiry-pedagogy items (12 in Llewellyn, 2004) or many
more representing specific, learner tasks in inquiry (79 in
Shore, Chichekian, Syer, Aulls, & Frederiksen, 2012).
Inductive open coding followed, of sentences in students'
replies defining inquiry and describing inquiry instruction
(Corbin & Strauss, 2015). The coder compared every sen-
tence in each definition or description with the next to deter-
mine if they were semantically alike or different. Those that
were alike were initially grouped by the noun-phrase or verb-
phrase in the responders' own written words to prevent the
coder from using too high a level of inference to represent
how they were alike. Continuing through all the passages,
the procedure resulted in groups of sentences or phrases
elaborating each theme. Themes might have occurred in the
definition, the description, or both. Some sentences could not
be categorized and did not contribute to a theme.
We assumed that the combination of (a) the conceptual
representation of inquiry--the definition--and (b) the situa-
tional representation of inquiry instruction they actually expe-
rienced and valued--the description--were evidence of their
understanding of inquiry. Definitions could likely be used to
represent goals for inquiry instruction. Descriptions could
likely represent declarative and procedural knowledge for
accomplishing inquiry instruction, articulating knowledge
they might be able to use as a basis for deciding what to teach
and how to enact inquiry instruction as a secondary teacher.
Coding reliability.From the literature, we anticipated that
responses to defining inquiry and describing best inquiry
experiences might differ in terms of cognitive demands. To
link prior inquiry experiences and current inquiry knowl-
edge, we needed a way to systematically and reliably code
both kinds of inquiry understanding.
Miles and Huberman (1994) suggested independently cod-
ing 25% of statements to assure interrater reliability.Arandom-
generator program identified 47 (28%) of the 167 statements
for coding by a graduate student unfamiliar with the research.
This rater was given the MISIO-Sm code guide (Table 1, two
left columns) and told the purpose of the exercise. Initial agree-
ment between the two coders on all categories was 74% for the
definitions. After discussing differences with the third author,
agreement rose to 90%. For the remaining 10%, consensus was
achieved between the second and third authors. Initial agree-
ment for the descriptions was 47%, perhaps reflecting the dif-
ficulty of coding such descriptive data. After discussing
differences and asking the third author to recode some difficult
statements, agreement rose to 78%. The source of greatest dis-
agreement was "interest" that was not among the MISIO-Sm
codes; we coded it "motivation." Remaining final codes
achieved consensus between the second and third authors.
Response length.This potential quantitative index of response
quality was inspired by two studies in other domains. Kobrin,
Aulls et al. 5
Deng, and Shaw (2007) counted words and paragraphs in 2,820
SAT essays; word-counts explained 39% of overall grade vari-
ance (r = .62). Tan (2010) tested 175 community college stu-
dents attending a developmental-writing course. Participants
scoring higher in reading ability and vocabulary wrote longer
text summaries containing significantly more ideas. Widely
used creativity measures also use word-counts (Torrance, 2008).
Results
Descriptive Information
Fifty-two participants (31%) previously took a research-
methods course and 54 (32%) reported completing a thesis or
a major project. Twelve (1%) had both experiences. Eighty-
one (49%) were enrolled in English language arts or second
language concentrations; 48 (29%) in physical education; 17
(10%) in mathematics, science, and technology; 13 (8%) in
social sciences; and eight (5%) in arts. These enrolments
were artifacts of scheduling; students in other programs (e.g.,
elementary education) were enrolled in different sections of
compulsory educational psychology.
Participants remembered 925 inquiry situations over their
years in school (see Table 1), with 386 (42%)--the highest--
at the secondary level, then 230 at university (25%), 185
(20%) at elementary school, and 124 (13%) at college. Total
numbers of elementary and secondary inquiry-instruction
experiences were moderately correlated (r = .41, n = 154,
p = .00), as were secondary and university-level inquiry
instances (r = .28, n = 151, p = .001). However, the numbers
of reported inquiry experiences between the college and uni-
versity levels were not significantly correlated (r = .09, n =
151, p = .25). Student-teachers recalled and described their
best inquiry experience mostly at the secondary level (58,
35%) followed by university (44, 26%), pre-university col-
lege (33, 20%), and least at the elementary level (15, 9%).
Seventeen participants (10%) did not respond.

Definitions.The 160 student-teachers who wrote defini-
tions of inquiry assigned the 23 MISIO-Sm codes 384
times with a range of one to seven and a mean of 2.4 codes.
Only two outlier definitions generated six and seven codes;
they were aggregated and the minimum-maximum range
of MISIO-Sm codes was reduced to one to five. To define
inquiry, participants used 6,039 total words, ranging from
eight to 124, with a mean word-count of 37.7. Four fifths
of the responses (306, 80%) were accounted for by the five
codes that each contributed 10% or more of the total: #14,
inquiry means generating questions (86, 22%); #1, acquisi-
tion of facts or knowledge by using different sources (66,
17%); #9, problem-solving skills (55, 14%); #15, motiva-
tion (52, 14%); and #21, student and teacher role changes
(47, 12%).
Descriptions.One hundred forty-eight participants assigned
278 MISIO-Sm codes to their descriptions. The minimum
was one, maximum four, and mean 1.9. Just four codes each
contributed more than 10% of the responses and together,
161 (58%) of the best-experienced inquiry descriptions: #1,
acquisition of facts and knowledge from different sources
(56, 22%), followed by #14, generating questions (41, 14%),
and #23, research papers completed (33, 12%), and #22, data
collection (31, 12%). Descriptions used 4,815 words, rang-
ing from one to 118 with a mean of 30.7. Twenty-five words
sufficed for 78 (53%) participants to describe their best
inquiry-instructional experience, and only two participants
(1%) wrote more than 100 words.
Comparing inquiry definitions and descriptions as indicators of
student-teachers' knowledge of inquiry.In Table 1, the total
frequencies of occurrence for nine categories, codes 2, 5, 6,
10, 11, 13, 16, 17, and 19, ranged between one and 10
occurrences (each below 2% of the total). These were sel-
dom used to define inquiry or describe enactment of inquiry
instruction that they recalled as their best inquiry-learning
experience.
The remaining 14 categories occurred 14 to 127 times.
The two most frequent categories (#14, question generation
and #1, acquisition of knowledge from different sources)
were found in both definitions and descriptions (127 and
122, respectively). Category 1 had similar frequencies for
definitions (66) and descriptions (56), but #14 occurred twice
as often in definitions (86) versus descriptions (41).
Categories #9, problem solving, #15, motivation, and
#21, role changes were also among the most frequently
occurring categories overall, with frequencies of 58, 54, and
47, respectively. However, these appeared more in defini-
tions and seldom in descriptions. Category 4, understanding,
occurred 38 times, twice as often in definitions (26) as
descriptions (12).
Categories 23, research, and 22, data collection, the next
most frequent, occurred 33 and 31 times, respectively. These

Strong (ID = 79; word-count = 91):
"Inquiry" does not mean just get a formal or pre-fixed
answer to certain pre-made questions. "Inquiry" is
stimulating searching attitude and desire to learn
and improve oneself rather than just getting simple
information or knowledge only. Therefore, it involves
the teachers' personal integrity, personality, and
attitude to involve the student's well-being because it
will initiate student's motivation to inquire and search
for real important things in life. Then students will put
their willing and voluntary effort to discover deeper
knowledge instead of stopping at getting the second-
hand information only.
5 items (10-14-8-
15-5)
Strong (ID = 104; word-count = 68):
The teacher always lectured.
However, we had to do a big
assignment in his class that
required us to form our own
questions. I went to the Ottawa
archives in order to accumulate
and study primary sources. I had
to make sense of the material on
my own. I felt like a discoverer, or
a historian, because I had to ask
questions and make sense of the
past.
6 items (14-10-16-
4-8-15)
Weak (ID = 54; word-count = 88):
To me, inquiry refers to an investigation. I would use
this word only to refer to official investigations,
such as the police are conducting an inquiry into
(someone's) death. However, as it is used in the paper
I assume it means question asking. Do the teachers/
professors encourage/discourage question asking?
Do they allow it? Are students free to ask questions
whenever they have them or only at the end of class?
To me, this concept is fairly straightforward, but it
hardly sticks out of mind.
2 items (14-15) Weak (ID = 65; word-count = 63):
The first 15 minutes of every day
were devoted to "calm down"
time. Teacher would ask us to
think out a "word" name, an event
or concept for the next day. In
effect this was a pre-teaching
activity as this inquiry was used as

occurred solely in inquiry-instruction descriptions. The
remaining four categories ranged between 14 and 29 occur-
rences in both definition and description: #3, procedural
learning, #7, knowledge or skill application, #8, developing
intellectual or thinking skills, and #11, positive attitude
toward the subject or learning.
These 14 more frequently used category frequencies
revealed interesting patterns when compared between and
within definitions and descriptions. Question generation
(#14) and acquisition of facts and knowledge from different
sources (#1) were the most common categories, shared by
the majority of secondary student-teachers as core elements
in their understanding of inquiry as central concepts in their
definitions of inquiry and also in their descriptions of good
inquiry-instructional practices that they experienced as
students.
Other shared categories followed similar patterns but
occurred less often. Categories #8, thinking skills, and #9,
problem solving focused on the development and the appli-
cation of skills. Category 3 (learning "how to" inquire) was
related to these because it encompasses enabling the learner
to self-regulate their application. These three categories
focus on cognitive strategies and their self-regulation used to
actively engage in inquiry alone or under teacher guidance.
University teachers often do not appear to consider these as
part of their instructional responsibility, perhaps because
they usually assume them to be already developed and make
few attempts to teach students how to do these strategies.
Instead they concentrate on constructing knowledge of the
subject-matter content rather showing students how to learn
how to acquire it.
A second pattern involved categories occurring exclu-
sively within inquiry definitions or descriptions. When a cat-
egory occurred only within definitions, but seldom or never
in descriptions, this could imply insufficient opportunity to
observe inquiry enacted or learn to do it, or having tried to do
it unsupervised. When the category occurred only within a
description, perhaps it had not attained the level of abstrac-
tion of a concept or cluster of concepts. Descriptions are evi-
dence of student awareness of a category, but their meaning
is assumed to be tacit rather than explicit. Tacit knowledge is
less easily accessed from memory to be used to acquire new
knowledge without assistance or outside the context in which
it was experienced. When a category represents a concept
used in a definition, it might have associated strategies that
are not evident in the description of best-experienced inquiry
instruction. Alternatively, it could be a token for a word used
as a concept. It can be repeated, but its meanings are not
necessarily clear. The pattern differences obtained through
qualitative analysis were also examined quantitatively.
Quantitative Analysis Results
We compared all 23 category frequencies for participants
who had done research, taken a research-methods course, or
both (see Table 3). Categories #14, question generation, and
#1, acquiring facts from multiple sources, were most fre-
quently cited by all three groups. Categories 6, relate con-
cepts, and 21, role changes, were in the definitions but not
the descriptions; Categories 10, learning to learn, 17, develop
expertise, 22, data collection, and 23, having done research
were present in the descriptions but not the definitions. At
least one student-teacher in each group cited Category 4,
understanding.
The frequency of cited inquiry-learning outcomes
(MISIO-Sm codes) in inquiry definitions and the number of
words used were significantly and positively correlated (r =
.60, n = 160, p < .001, large effect size R2 = .36). A similar
result emerged for inquiry descriptions (r = .41, n = 148, p <
.001, moderate effect size R2 = .17). However, there was a
low positive correlation between the numbers of words used
to define inquiry and words used to describe the best inquiry
experience recalled (r = .18, N = 151, p = .025, small effect
size R2 = .03). This finding reaffirmed our assumption that
the definition and description tasks tapped different cogni-
tive processes underlying inquiry understanding. Only one
significant 2 was obtained between having completed a the-
sis or major project and definitions of inquiry coded for stu-
dent outcomes, 2(4, 106) = 10.61, p = .03; medium effect
size  = .32.
One-way ANOVA revealed no significant difference in
the number of MISIO-Sm student-inquiry outcomes in the
descriptions related to theses or major projects completed. A
significant 2 was obtained, between having taken a research-
methods course and the number of MISIO-Sm outcomes
found in descriptions of the best inquiry-instruction partici-
pants recalled, 2(2, N = 146) = 6.51, p = .04; the effect size
( = .21) was medium.
To follow-up potential differences in the patterns of codes
between inquiry definitions and descriptions, we conducted
three other statistical analyses. First, we conducted a 2 on
the frequency columns of Table 1 for definitions and descrip-
tions. The patterns were significantly different, 2(22, N =
146) = 248.86, p = .00 (extremely large effect size = 1.30).
Second, given that these distributions might be associated
with prior research experiences or having studied research-
methods, we divided our sample into three: student-teachers
who had done a thesis or research project, who had taken a
research-methods course, and who did neither (we omitted
those who had done both). First, we repeated the 2 calcula-
tion of the three groups by the 23 code categories, separately
for the definitions and descriptions. The 2 statistics were
nonsignificant; therefore, differences between, not within,
the groups warranted most attention.
We then compared the proportions of the two most fre-
quent response codes for definitions and descriptions in turn,
for the thesis and research-methods groups combined versus
those who had neither prior experience. These two most fre-
quent codes in both cases were #14 (generating questions)
8 SAGE Open
and #1 (acquiring facts using different sources), but in
reverse order.
For the descriptions, of 49 coded instances, 34 (69%) of
the research-experienced group defined inquiry instruction
as acquiring facts from different sources (code #1), versus 15
(31%) of those who had neither experience. The significant
sign test probability was p = .009. The same numbers defined
inquiry instruction as generating questions (code #14), p =
.009, also significant. In contrast, neither comparison was
significant for the definitions. In articulating descriptions of
inquiry instruction, respondents having either thesis or
research-methods course experience versus neither, despite
similar patterns of frequencies across the 23 codes, used
more categories and differed uniquely and significantly in
their proportions of the two most frequently assigned codes.
We also checked five other background variables sug-
gested in the literature (numbers of inquiry experiences
across schooling levels; grade and subject in which best
inquiry experiences occurred; having completed a creative
project such as writing a play or song; having designed a cur-
riculum, software, or other product; and months of preser-
vice teaching experience), but none was related to the quality
of inquiry understanding reflected in either definitions or
descriptions.
Discussion and Conclusion
Our first purpose was to examine the words used by second-
ary preservice teachers to reveal their conceptual and experi-
ential understanding of inquiry and inquiry instruction. A
secondary but prerequisite purpose was to develop an instru-
ment and coding system that could reflect their inquiry
understanding.
Measuring the Quality of Inquiry Understanding
Secondary preservice teachers' understanding of inquiry
and inquiry instruction can be usefully evaluated by coding
questionnaire replies in terms of learners' inquiry-related
outcomes. All codes were assigned at least once, but there
was wide variation in the frequency with which each was
found in secondary student-teachers'responses to requests to
define inquiry or describe inquiry instruction. We concluded
that the MISIO-Sm codes in Table 1 can be used effectively
to describe the concepts and instructional situations that sec-
ondary preservice teachers associate with inquiry.
The MISIO-Sm is built around student inquiry-learning
outcomes with which preservice teachers are likely familiar
and engaged, and it has a sufficiently wide range of items to
enable detection of subtle inquiry-category differences such
as detecting changes in teachers' and students' roles or col-
lecting data from multiple sources. It might usefully be fur-
ther explored as a measure of learning about inquiry over the
course of teacher education and early-career experiences.
The MISIO-Sm codes were sensitive to differences between
preservice teachers' responses considered strong or weak.
Each was moderately correlated with the total word-count of
the replies. However, correlations were low between catego-
ries underlying the definitions versus the descriptions. This
result suggests that secondary preservice teachers' under-
standing of inquiry occurs separately at conceptual and expe-
riential levels. These two kinds of inquiry understanding
include some common and some unique inquiry categories
and therefore are not measuring the same thing: Providing a
definition of inquiry or providing a description of an inquiry
event are not equivalent tasks, at least for a student-teacher.
Educational Background Variables Uniquely
Related to Inquiry Understanding
What makes inquiry stick? In general, secondary student-
teachers understand inquiry and inquiry instruction to mean
generating questions and acquiring new knowledge and facts
from multiple sources. Next, they understand inquiry to
include learning problem-solving skills, enhancing motiva-
tion, and changes in students' and teachers' roles. Finally,
inquiry was understood as improving understanding, doing
research, collecting data, and building thinking skills. More

sophisticated learning outcomes such as developing exper-
tise, emulating professionals, learning how to learn, and
enhancing self-efficacy were rarely coded. The recognition
of role changes was, however, insightful and reflected
knowledge that research has deemed critical to successful
enactment of inquiry instruction (Aulls et al., 2015).
Second, having done a thesis or other research project and
having taken a research-methods course were related to sec-
ondary student-teachers' understanding of inquiry and
inquiry instruction. The relatively low frequencies of indi-
vidual students whose replies invoked three or more of the
23 codes is not encouraging; however, it is consistent with
Windschitl's (2002, 2004) observation that extended research
experience was associated with inquiry use in just one of his
secondary preservice teachers'first year teaching secondary-
science classes. Crawford (1999) also reported a case study
that came to the same conclusion.
Hands-on, direct experience with inquiry as teaching and
learning might help student-teachers recall salient and more
sophisticated elements of inquiry instruction. This is consis-
tent with Meijer's (2007) observation that a research-methods
course improved but did not guarantee inquiry understanding.
It is also compatible with the comparison by Syer, Chichekian,
Shore, and Aulls (2012) in which student-teachers who had
inquiry experiences as teachers were directly comparable with
psychology undergraduates who had done a major research
project in recognition and valuing of major elements of doing
inquiry. However, the education students were better able to
articulate the inquiry as a pedagogical approach.
Categories of learner outcomes associated with inquiry as
pedagogy are expressed more explicitly in descriptions than
in definitions. Taking a research-methods course was a better
predictor than past research experience of a quality inquiry-
instruction description. However, the quality of abstract or
conceptual definitions of inquiry is related to having had
prior direct instruction in how to do research.
Research-methods courses benefit from being recent in
students'recollections. Such courses build vocabulary to talk
with others about inquiry and help cast student-teachers, per-
haps vicariously, into authentic roles that emulate the work
of teachers or their professors. Having learned about research
methods in a course might enhance the ability to recognize
inquiry in one's own learning history. Skills and dispositions
learned, such as choosing a topic based on personal interest,
acting as a professional creator of new knowledge, and eval-
uating evidence, could become connected to the outcomes
they remembered from past inquiry experiences. If the course
is in education, the links could be even stronger.
Third, generating definitions and descriptions are not only
different cognitive tasks, but they also constitute different
student resources for preservice teachers to build an under-
standing of inquiry useful to growth in teaching.
Three types of student-inquiry outcomes are most fre-
quent when preservice teachers define or describe inquiry,
namely, acquisition of facts or knowledge using different
sources, problem-solving skills, and question-generation. All
three were common to both definitions and descriptions of
inquiry. Question generation was the most frequent outcome
cited in the definitions and third in the descriptions. Problem
solving was third in definitions, fourth in descriptions. The
fact that they all occur in students'current knowledge as well
as descriptions of past instructional experiences in school
affords evidence of their face validity. Our interpretation is
that preservice teachers respond at a very concrete level
when challenged by the request to conceptually define
inquiry, but they are able to articulate broader generaliza-
tions about inquiry when they can draw on vivid, well-
remembered, personal experiences.
Finally, total word-counts do not indicate the content or
quality of an individual's understanding of inquiry, so they
should not be used for individual evaluations, to track learn-
ing, or to compare definitions or descriptions.
Limitations and Opportunities for Further Study
This study was ex-post-facto and a snap-shot of student-
teachers in their last year of coursework toward secondary-
teaching certification. Richer data could be available from a
longitudinal design more like Crawford's (1999) or
Windschitl's (2002), but with a purposeful sample that
includes student-teachers with a range of experiences in
terms of research and research-related courses. We did not
follow their progress from acceptance into university to
graduation as a teacher and into professional practice, as
done by Chichekian, Shore, and Tabatabai (2016), who also
triangulated other data, such as interviews and focus groups.
Using the coding categories identified in this study,
researchers could use a larger and random rather than a pur-
poseful sample to determine how generalizable the results of
the study might be. The use of open coding might also gener-
ate additional distinguishing categories among the defini-
tions and descriptions.
Implications for Theory and Research
A future model or theory of inquiry instruction should focus
on the knowledge bases of preservice teachers and on just
two background variables, research-methods training and
research experiences. Social-constructivist learning theory
(Vygotsky, 1978) seems barely articulated in preservice
teachers' inquiry understanding. Focusing on student-teach-
ers' understanding and instructional use of their own inquiry
experiences might be an important early step toward being
able to conceptualize rich inquiry experiences for their own
future students.
That student-teachers' understanding of the nature of
inquiry is revealed differently in the quality of general defi-
nitions versus the quality of descriptions of well-recalled
prior inquiry experiences does not mean that the same dis-
tinction characterizes experienced teachers. Rather, the
10 SAGE Open
distinction might especially help describe the trajectory from
novice to expert inquiry teacher. Chichekian et al. (2016)
specifically addressed this progression, but with regard to
self-efficacy for inquiry instruction rather than understand-
ing of inquiry.
Implications for Practice
It is feasible in the selection and education of secondary
teachers to provide both research experiences and research-
methods courses in close proximity to the rest of the teacher-
education program. This idea is well established in
undergraduate education generally (Boyer Commission on
Educating Undergraduates in the Research University, 1998).
The conceptually based research-methods course is the eas-
ier of the two to arrange and require. It has the most salient
links to more sophisticated inquiry understanding and prac-
tices. It can also engage students in inquiry projects.
How student-teachers conceptualize inquiry instruction is
likely connected to what they actually do during their formal
education. Dewey recommended that teacher-education pro-
grams have a laboratory school (Tanner, 1997) to facilitate
immersing preservice teachers in a culture of simultaneous
inquiry learning, teaching, and research. Student-teachers
often (but not always) regard practicum experiences as the
most valuable part of teacher education (Melynchuk, 2001).
Notably, none of our participants reported his or her best
inquiry-instructional experiences to have occurred during
student-teaching. Instead, they were associated with their
experiences in elementary and secondary education.
Teaching student-teachers about inquiry conceptually is
probably better done, at least initially, through reference to
the design and enactment of their own inquiry instruction.
Thesis-like work and research-methods courses can be
designed to further build these opportunities into teacher-
education programs. It seems unnecessary to worry about
what earlier inquiry experiences student-teachers had, in
what subjects, or at what level of education, nor to be primar-
ily concerned about the nature of inquiry experiences in
"content" courses at the university level.
