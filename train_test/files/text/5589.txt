Introduction
The concepts climate change scepticism and climate change
sceptic1 are in wide use and refer to a fairly consistent family
of arguments and pool of individuals that reject, dispute, or
question the mainstream/orthodox thesis that the global cli-
mate is changing primarily due to human activities and that
these changes will affect severely both ecosystems and human
populations if left unarrested. The concept has a strong nega-
tive connotation because nonacceptance of the mainstream
thesis is generally considered indefensible given the estab-
lished nature of the science and the gravity of the problem.
The concept is often used as a means to isolate and delegiti-
mise arguments and individuals assigned to the category.
Mainstream exponents have little difficulty labeling critics of
the orthodoxy as "sceptics" or "deniers." For many main-
stream adherents, it does not matter if one positively rejects,
disputes, or is merely unconvinced, ambivalent, or agnostic
about the core climate claims. The net effect is the same: non-
acceptance of a thesis about which no doubt should exist.
This article critically reexamines the conceptual constitu-
tion of the category. It is noted that sceptics from different
walks of life and with different levels of expertise deliver a
wide array of critiques at the mainstream thesis and display a
wide range of intensities of belief (or nonbelief). Some act as
vocal public champions of the sceptic cause while others
reservedly express unease about the reliability of the science.
Some evidently exploit the issue for personal gain and others
are seen to raise their critiques as concerned and responsible
citizens. These shades of the phenomenon are largely lost in
both the public and scholarly discourse where the blanket
labels climate change scepticism/denial and climate change
sceptic/denier still dominate. And on occasions where the
concept is being disentangled, some contestation of the con-
cept and its labels remains evident (Capstick & Pidgeon,
2014; O'Neill & Boykoff, 2010).
Following Capstick and Pidgeon's (2014) identification
of "two broad treatments" of the concept, namely, in relation
to its epistemic and behavioural senses, this article sets out a
scheme for its further delineation (p. 390). It proposes the
isolation of "process scepticism" as a distinct center of scep-
ticism alongside the familiar "evidence" and "response" cri-
tiques of sceptics. It is argued that these three conceptual

Climate Change Scepticism: A
Conceptual Re-Evaluation
Willem Van Rensburg1
Abstract
"Climate change scepticism" is a familiar concept in popular and scholarly discourse and generally refers to a family of
arguments and individuals that reject, dispute, or question the orthodox view of the climate issue. At close range though,
it is evident that the concept is often used casually, without consideration of the complexity of the category it represents.
Scholars have varied interpretations of the concept and sometimes actively dispute its meaning and reach. The article
proposes that the sceptic phenomenon can be variegated according to the types of sceptic critiques and, additionally,
according to sceptics' attitudinal characteristics. Taxonomies are proposed for each. The types of sceptic arguments are
organised in a conceptual hierarchy consisting of two classes of critiques ("core" and "concomitant"), three centers of
scepticism ("evidence," "process," and "response"), and seven specific objects of scepticism. For the attitudinal characteristics
of sceptics, the article takes stock of the different motives, modes, and certainties of belief among sceptics. It proposes some
relabeling of the category and subcategories to more accurately describe nuances in sceptic positions, as well as to dispose
of unproductive labels. The article suggests how the refined conceptualisation might help observers and policy practitioners
to manage the sceptic challenge in a more discerning and constructive fashion.

stations allow observers to draw important qualitative dis-
tinctions between sceptics based on where their scepticism is
anchored. It also helps to show the various ways in which
sceptic logic "flows," for instance, from the evidence center
to the process and response centers, or from the process cen-
ter to the evidence and response centers. It is an important
proposition in this analysis that the process center is under-
rated as a primary source of scepticism from which sceptics
might derive their evidence and response misgivings. The
article also reflects on the attitudinal variety among sceptics,
that is, their different qualities of belief, as well as the labels
to describe these. Effort is made to dispose of inaccurate and
counterproductive labeling practices.
Improved conceptualisation of climate change scepticism
has both academic and practical benefit. The following areas
stand out where advances could be made in reducing misin-
terpretation of the phenomenon and mismanagement of the
sceptic challenge.
·
· Climate change scepticism among elites and intellec-
tuals is often constructed as rooted in and motivated
by extraepistemic concerns. The scholarly narrative of
the scepticism of elites is that it is primarily an artifact
of material, political, and ideological forces and that
the evidence dispute is a mere smoke screen for these
forces to play out (see Gelbspan, 2004; Hamilton,
2006; Hoggan, 2009; Leggett, 2001; McCright &
Dunlap, 2010; Oreskes & Conway, 2010; Pooley,
2010). The story of climate change scepticism is one
of self-interest and manipulation, of how a scientific
controversy was fabricated to confuse the public and
decision makers, and delay decisive action against cli-
mate change. The logic in this story line is that scep-
tics are actually defending, knowingly and
unknowingly, vested economic interests (those with a
stake in the continuation of a fossil fuel­based energy
economy) and the prevailing neoliberal free market
paradigm (which includes the notions of individual
freedom, small government, and economic growth).
Although such observations about climate change
scepticism and sceptics are well founded, they have
come at a cost. Sceptic elites of various persuasions
and motivations have come to be understood as disin-
genuous. Engagement of sceptics has become cli-
chéd--married to the idea that there simply must be
extraneous reasons for someone to doubt the main-
stream climate view.
·
· Another area of potential misjudgment emanates from
the tendency of exponents on both sides to draw stark
battle lines between "credible experts" and "fraud-
sters," between "sound" science and "junk" science,
and between respectable scientific establishments and
pseudoscientific lobbies. These debates are important
in helping to clear the scientific air, but when they are
sweepingly cast as a battle between right and wrong,
competent and incompetent, and reputable and disrep-
utable, the opposing side is reduced to a one-dimen-
sional stereotype. In the process, opportunities are lost
for the constructive engagement of amenable sceptics.
·
· Potential miscalculation might also occur through mis-
interpretation of sceptics' "extended" critiques.
Sceptics very rarely confine their critiques to the phys-
ical evidence of climate change. They often, and
expectedly so, extend their arguments to climate rele-
vant topics, such as debates about the integrity of the
scientific processes behind the evidence for dangerous
human-caused climate change or debates about soci-
ety's response to the climate issue. The dilemma is that
although their extended arguments are commensurate
with their readings of the science, sceptics are not the
only proprietors of these arguments. Many nonscep-
tics, particularly among right-wing partisans but not
exclusively so, are, just like the sceptics, concerned
about perceived deficiencies in the processes behind
climate science and/or climate policy responses. It is
important, therefore, to place the respective types of
sceptic critiques into proper perspective.
·
· Most mainstream adherents view the sceptic chal-
lenge as a grave threat to the credibility of climate sci-
ence because it is perceived to undermine the science,
rather than enhance it. Cook states that climate change
scepticism is "the complete opposite" of genuine sci-
entific scepticism: "It's coming to a preconceived
conclusion and cherry picking the information that
backs up your opinion. Global warming scepticism
isn't scepticism at all" (Mulvaney, 2010). The prob-
lem with this kind of generalised dismissal of climate
scepticism is that sceptics invert such dismissals as
proof of their initial concern that scientific processes
are not transparent and open to scrutiny. There is a
need, therefore, to consider if and how sceptics' cri-
tiques might be used constructively to demonstrate
rigour and due process in climate science.
The rest of the article is organised into two main sections,
the first to investigate the types of sceptic critiques, that is, the
objects of scepticism, and the second to investigate the attitu-
dinal variety among sceptics, that is, their motives, modus
operandi, and the certainties of belief that they bring to the
debate. Each section ends with a proposal for a taxonomy.
The conclusion of the article raises some practical applica-
tions of a refined conceptualisation of the phenomenon.
Objects of Scepticism
Evidence Scepticism (Trend, Cause, and Impact
Scepticism)
Rahmstorf (2005) pioneered the trend­attribution­impact
typology of climate change scepticism, which disentangles
Van Rensburg 3
sceptics' challenge of the scientific evidence of anthropo-
genic climate change. This approach assumes that sceptics
follow a "stepped" pattern of scepticism with trend scepti-
cism, that is, denying a significant warming trend or pro-
claiming a cooling trend, at the pinnacle. Attribution
scepticism would be one step down on the scepticism ladder
because it might accept the trend claim but not that humans
are primarily responsible. Impact scepticism would be
another step down because it might accept that humans are
altering the climate but downplays the scale of potential neg-
ative effects from climate change. The trend­attribution­
impact typology enjoys wide currency. Wikipedia (2014)
defines climate change denial as a set of organised attempts
to downplay, deny, or dismiss the scientific consensus on the
extent of global warming (trend claim), its significance
(impact claim), and its connection to human behavior (attri-
bution claim). The typology has also been expressed as
"stages" of denialism, where a sceptic might start off as a
trend sceptic but, as the evidence of global warming mounts,
migrate to attribution scepticism and, again, as the evidence
of human influence on the climate mounts, migrate to impact
scepticism (Hamilton, 2007; Nuccitelli, 2013).
Rahmstorf's typology is realistic and useful because it mir-
rors the evidence claims made in Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports, the most authori-
tative account of the mainstream thesis. The first three chap-
ters of the last complete IPCC Assessment Report, AR4
published in 2007,2 respectively deal with the trend of climate
change, its causes, and its impacts (see Pachauri, Reisinger, &
Core Writing Team, 2007). AR4 states that "Warming of the
climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from obser-
vations of increases in global average air and ocean tempera-
tures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global
average sea level" (p. 30). This is the so-called trend claim. It
also finds that "Most of the observed increase in global aver-
age temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due
to the observed increase in anthropogenic GHG concentra-
tions" (p. 39).This is the so-called attribution claim. Regarding
the impacts of climate change, the report describes different
scenarios for different warming stabilisation levels. At a 2 °C
above 20th-century average temperature stabilisation level
(the lowest modeled by AR4), it foresees "hundreds of mil-
lions of people exposed to increased water stress," "increased
damage from floods and storms," "changed distribution of
some disease vectors," and "increased morbidity and mortality
from heat waves, floods and droughts." These, and many more
region specific predictions, are the so-called impact claims.
These claims are fairly unequivocal, and mainstream
exponents generally accept them as the core claims of the
mainstream climate thesis about which no doubt should exist.
Sometimes, sceptics respond to the core claims in equally
unequivocal terms, such as in the following examples:
Earth's temperature is currently cooling slightly, ocean heat is
declining, global sea-level rise has not accelerated (although the
climate models predict that it should) and tropical storm energy
is at a thirty-year low. (Carter, 2011, p. 39)
The warmists are correct that CO2 is a greenhouse gas and it
causes warming, that CO2 levels have been rising, and that it has
been warming. Serious sceptics agree with all that, but point out
that it does not prove that something else isn't causing most of
the warming. (Evans, 2012)
There is no evidence that man's production of carbon dioxide is
causing more extreme weather events. Any change caused by
man will be gradual and there will be plenty of time to adapt, as
humans have always done. Most people will hardly notice it.
(Forbes, 2013b)
More typically, however, sceptic responses are convo-
luted, which can make it difficult to pinpoint their specific
objects of scepticism, as seen in the following statement
from the Australian sceptic group, The Carbon Sense
Coalition (Forbes, 2013a). The author's comments appear in
square brackets.
The so called greenhouse gases (mainly water vapour and
carbon dioxide) have the ability to absorb radiant energy and
transmit it to their surroundings [accepting the potential
contribution of CO2 to global warming] . . . carbon dioxide
occurs in tiny trace amounts in the atmosphere, and any surface
heating it could do is already being done by water vapour [not
rejecting but downplaying the attribution claim], which is more
abundant and affects far more energy wavelengths. . . . It
probably makes the nights slightly warmer, especially in higher
latitudes during winter; and it probably has little effect on
daytime temperatures [limited acceptance of the trend claim].
But additional carbon dioxide in the biosphere gives a major
boost to all plants which feed all animals [downplaying negative
impacts]. It is not a pollutant, anywhere [rhetorically
indemnifying CO2]. (http://carbon-sense.com/, The Carbon
Sense Coalition, The Global Warming Gas, or The Bread and
Butter of Life? June 17, 2013, http://carbon-sense.com/
wp-content/uploads/2013/06/gas-of-global-warming.pdf)
It is proposed here that the trend, attribution, and impact
objects constitute the core of the concept "climate change
scepticism" because they correlate directly, one-to-one, with
the core assertions of the mainstream climate thesis. If the
concept is to be preserved in its commonsense meaning as
the antithetical climate view, that is, not just any problematic
climate view, then the primacy of its grounding in the evi-
dence dispute should be accepted. That the evidence dispute
should serve as the definitional heart of the concept is implic-
itly recognised in studies that present frameworks that place
the evidence dimension at the "top" or categorically preced-
ing other dimensions (cf. Capstick & Pidgeon, 2014, pp. 391,
397). Akter, Bennett, and Ward (2012) are somewhat more
explicit in this regard when they find that attribution scepti-
cism was "a common source of impact, mitigation and global
co-operation scepticism" (p. 25).

The importance of specifying the evidence dispute as the
definitional heart of the concept will become clearer in the
subsequent sections that discuss sceptics' "extended" argu-
ments, that is, aspects of the climate debate that are natively
commensurate with evidence scepticism but not dependent
on it (collectively referred to as "concomitant" objects of
scepticism).
Process Scepticism
Sceptics make various critiques of the scientific, bureau-
cratic, and political processes behind mainstream climate
science. Their arguments about the scientific processes
include that the massive funding of climate research has
become a biasing factor in climate research, that important
"new" and contradictory research is habitually overlooked
in mainstream climate research, that there are serious lapses
in peer review and oversight of published research (in par-
ticular, IPCC reports are seen as consensus documents,
rather than scientific "truth"), and that overreliance on and
manipulation of computer modeling is distorting climate
research. The political decision-making processes relating
to the climate issue are also directly and indirectly ques-
tioned by sceptics when they claim that the climate issue
might be a hoax or conspiracy and that prominent main-
stream exponents and the media exaggerate the climate
threat (see Smith & Leiserowitz, 2012; Whitmarsh, 2011).
The context of these suspicions is that the public is being
misled and that public decision-making processes are
distorted.
Although sceptics' process critiques are well recognised
as an integral part of sceptic arguments, these have hitherto
not been presented as a separate center of scepticism.
Capstick and Pidgeon (2014) place doubts about the conduct
of science, the reliability of mainstream climate expertise,
and the portrayal and communication of climate science in
the same category as the disputation of the physical evidence,
which they collectively call "epistemic scepticism" (pp. 390-
391, 397). These objects of scepticism have a similar func-
tional purpose, namely, to cast doubt on "the status and
generation of knowledge around climate change."
It is argued here that sceptics' process critiques require a
distinct conceptual status. The concept process scepticism
sets apart a group of sceptic arguments that are not dependent
on either evidence or response scepticism but enables and
strengthens them. It is proposed that "process scepticism" is
a strong center of scepticism and that many sceptics are
indeed anchored in this center, rather than the detailed tech-
nical contests around the evidence or how society should
respond. The process critiques (e.g., there is a lucrative cli-
mate industry, scientists pursue funding and shut out dissent-
ingvoices,themediaexaggeratesthethreat,environmentalists
and socialists drive the climate agenda) appeal intuitively to
sceptics, who are strongly oriented in the climate issue by
cognitive, cultural, and ideological predispositions (Kahan,
2012; Kahan &Braman, 2006). Scholars have found that pro-
cess critiques are conspicuously present in the affective
imagery cognitive processes responsible for climate change
scepticism (Smith & Leiserowitz, 2012).
"Process scepticism," therefore, offers a conceptual
option that allows observers to draw distinctions between
three centers of scepticism, the other two being evidence and
response scepticism. It helps to differentiate sceptics of the
physical evidence who extend their sceptic assault to process
issues (and ultimately the response question) from those who
have no clear knowledge of, or judgment about, the evidence
and ground their apprehensions in perceived process irregu-
larities and response deficiencies.
Process critiques also differ from evidence critiques in
that they can be held by nonsceptics. Mike Hulme, a former
lead author at the IPCC and patently nonsceptical of the
mainstream thesis, has been publicly critical of the IPCC's
emphasis on "consensus building" (Hulme & Mahony, 2010,
pp. 10-11), its reluctance to allow scrutiny (Hulme &
Mahony, 2013), as well as the apparent closing of ranks by
the climate scientists at the center of the so-called Climategate
revelations (Hulme, 2013b). Process scepticism is therefore
open to sceptics and nonsceptics alike, whereas evidence
scepticism, by definition, excludes the nonsceptics.
Response Scepticism
Several observers recognise that scepticism of the public and
private responses to the climate issue is an important center
of scepticism. Hamilton (2013) argues that response scepti-
cism is one of the common themes in the family of sceptic
arguments:
First, they deny that climate change is occurring. Then they say
that if it is occurring it's not due to humans. Then they claim that
if it is due to humans, the effects are trivial. If the effects are
shown to be non-trivial, they opine that the benefits will exceed
the damage. If the damage is shown to predominate, they say the
cost of avoiding the damage is too high.
Painter is more emphatic and includes "policy sceptics"
as a fourth type in his typology (Painter, 2012, p. 196).
Capstick and Pidgeon (2014) offer a two-pronged typology
with "response scepticism" as the second type next to "epis-
temic scepticism". In their conceptualisation, "response
scepticism" concerns "(D)oubts about the efficacy of action
on climate change; doubts about the personal and societal
relevance of climate change" (p. 397). Akter et al. (2012)
propose five dimensions of scepticism, the first three of
which relate to the evidential base of climate science, and the
last two, which they call "mitigation scepticism" and "global
co-operation scepticism," relating to society's response to
the climate issue (p. 3). For some, response scepticism repre-
sents the epitome of climate change scepticism. SourceWatch
defines a "global warming sceptic" as
Van Rensburg 5
any position within the umbrella group, "opponents of effective
global warming action," where "effective action" entails putting
a price on fossil fuel emissions, such that their true cost becomes
clear and the economic "invisible hand" can wreak its market
magic. (SourceWatch, 2014)
It could be argued that sceptics would be impelled, on the
basis of their contrary reading of climate science, to oppose
climate mitigation responses. The majority of sceptics do, in
fact, follow the logic of their evidence scepticism through in
this way. Yet, some scholars caution that there is no straight
line between scientific evidence and one's choice of response;
that a certain reading of the science does not necessarily
imply a certain policy preference. Research has shown that
people's support for climate mitigation depends significantly
on factors other than their assessment of the probability and
severity of future climate risks. Lee and Cameron (2008)
found that willingness to pay for climate mitigation varies
according to the domestic instrument of choice, as well as the
international level of cooperation. The point is also argued
philosophically, for instance, Hulme (2013a), who calls for a
"repoliticise(ation of) climate change, to challenge the scien-
ticism which suggests that science should trump politics"
(p. 295). Anderegg (2010b) makes a similar point:
. . . science has little or no special role in determining should we
act to curtail climate change and how we should act. This path
must be picked up by economists, social scientists, ethicists,
humanists, and the general public. (p. 336)
The ambiguity between science and policy is nowhere
clearer than in the case of the impact sceptics. Impact scepti-
cism is commensurate with a wide range of possible policy
responses. Some impact sceptics dismiss mitigation because
for them it is addressing a nonexistent problem. Others have
a pragmatic view, believing that even if they do not expect
severe negative climate impacts, climate mitigation mea-
sures might deliver positive spin-offs in terms of greater
energy efficiency and the promotion of cleaner technologies
(Van Rensburg, 2012). In addition, impact sceptics find
themselves aligned with nonsceptics who oppose mitigation
because they doubt the cost-effectiveness of such measures,
not because they doubt the negative impacts of climate
change. The controversial Danish economist Bjørn Lomborg,
who advocates an alternative response path purely based on
cost­benefit considerations, is an example (Lomborg, 2009).
The differences between impact scepticism and response
scepticism blur when sceptics appropriate the arguments of
nonsceptics like Lomborg to open another line of attack
against the climate change orthodoxy and its supposed eco-
nomic imperatives.
The ambiguity of opposition to climate policies is also
demonstrated by left-wing critiques of carbon pricing mech-
anisms. A few examples from the Australian context are
quoted here. The Green Left Weekly (Butler, 2012), the
mouthpiece of a socialist environmentalist activist group,
describes the climate change debate as a "fake" debate
because the outcomes of the two big national parties' (the
center­right Liberal­National Party [L-NP] Coalition and
the center­left Australian Labor Party [ALP]) climate poli-
cies would be very similar. Calling the L-NP Coalition "cli-
mate deniers" and the ALP climate "pretenders," it argues
that even though the ALP is more ambitious than the L-NP
Coalition, its policies too would be too little too late. "To act
slowly or to act not at all matters little. Both will bring the
exact same result--an unspeakable future of climate catas-
trophe." The group is convinced that the reigning economic
model cannot solve the climate problem: ". . . the biggest
(problem) is that it assumes we can solve the climate crisis
with the same kind of thinking that got us into it." Carbon
pricing, as an "indirect lever to bring emissions down" is dis-
missed in favor of "direct measures" such as the outright pro-
hibition of fossil fuel extraction, closing fossil fuel
infrastructure and deploying renewable sources of energy.
The Green Left Weekly argument is echoed by the leftist blog
En Passant (Passant, 2013), which describes the "discourse
between the Government and Opposition" as "irrelevant."
"Labor doesn't have a commitment to the environment. It
has a commitment to capitalism and getting elected." Just
like the Green Left Weekly, it argues that carbon pricing will
not solve the problem--"capitalism cannot address climate
change." En Passant calls for "system change" before there
could be any hope of addressing climate change.
These sentiments are not confined to Australian environ-
mentalists. Naomi Klein, Canadian anticorporatism, antiglo-
balisation, and environmentalist writer and activist, believes
that the environmental movement is in "deep denial" about
the failure of carbon pricing to deliver big emission cuts
(Mark, 2013). She argues that climate initiatives like the
Kyoto Protocol, the UN Clean Development Mechanism,
and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme have "disastrous"
track records. They have not reduced emissions, are charac-
terised by "no end of scams," and have resulted in a massive
"corporate giveaway." Caught up in the "neoliberal eco-
nomic orthodoxy" many environmentalists have bought into
the notion that corporations are part of the solution. She
argues that environmentalists should have "fought back,"
"defend(ed) the values it stood for," and "resist(ed) the
steamroller that was neoliberalism." She argues that environ-
mental victories in the past have come through "command-
and-control" pieces of legislation; a "top-down regulatory
approach."
Response scepticism is the most distant from evidence
scepticism, which is the definitional heart of climate change
scepticism. Because it speaks to matters of governance that
have relevance quite independent from the climate issue, like
the desired level of government regulation, the timing and
efficacy of tax/pricing mechanisms, and strategic consider-
ations of a nation's global responsibilities and capabilities,
response scepticism is accessible to a much wider general
audience. Reserving a unique conceptual space for response
6 SAGE Open
scepticism allows discrimination between sceptics who are
grounded in evidence critiques and those who are more con-
cerned about the broader governance issues associated with
climate responses.
Proposal for a Taxonomy
Figure 1 shows how the aforementioned types of sceptic
arguments can be conceptually organised. At the lowest level
of classification, sceptic critiques belong to one of seven spe-
cific "objects" or targets of scepticism. Considering the
nature of each of these specific sceptic targets, three "cen-
tres" of scepticism emerge. The three centers--evidence,
process, and response--provide a neat categorisation that
provides a home for the technical evidence dispute, a home
for arguments about the processes through which the evi-
dence pass beyond the laboratory, and finally a home for
arguments about how society should respond to the evidence
(or perceived lack of evidence). At the top level of categori-
sation, the centers of scepticism divide into two broad classes
of sceptic arguments. The evidence critiques are labeled core
and definitional--"core" because of their antecedent nature
and "definitional" to preserve the integrity of "climate
change scepticism" as the antithetical climate view. The pro-
cess and response critiques are labeled concomitant3 because
they are commensurate with but not dependent on evidence
scepticism. The core class of critiques defines a sceptic as a
sceptic and attracts the concomitant class of critiques that are
highly congruent with and supportive of evidence scepti-
cism. In many cases, the concomitant arguments dominate
sceptics'argumentative rationales. They are widely acknowl-
edged as integrally part of the sceptic identity.
The distinction between core and concomitant types of
critiques remain important though. An individual's scepti-
cism might primarily reside in the concomitant objects, from
where evidence deficiencies are inferred, without the person
making (or able to make) an informed assessment of the
physical science. Individuals who are rooted in the concomi-
tant objects of scepticism might be expected to be less rigor-
ous and less intense when they profess their views because
they have not committed to one or more of the core evidence
objects, like the more virulent and outspoken sceptics.
Observers and policy practitioners dealing with the sceptic
challenge need to approach the concomitant critiques with
caution because they can be, and are, held by nonsceptics as
well.
Table 1 provides some examples of typical sceptical
claims associated with each object of scepticism.
This taxonomy makes clear the bases for drawing dis-
tinctions among sceptics and their arguments, and might be
used as a practical tool to classify sceptics, bearing in mind,
though, that sceptics can be rhetorically skillful and that
they often couch or hedge their claims. Also, most sceptics
critique a casual mix of variously the evidence, processes,
and responses associated with the mainstream view, which
can make it difficult to determine their essential dispute or
concern. The challenge, from an analytical point of view, is
to establish where the weight of an individual's sceptic
claims rests, or which object(s) are instrumental in their
arguments. Such analysis would allow meaningful and pur-
poseful discrimination within the sceptic category, the
implications of which are highlighted in the "Conclusion"
section.
The article now proceeds to deal with additional bases for
variegating the sceptic phenomenon. These are collectively
called "attitudinal" characteristics because they speak to the
character or quality of sceptics' beliefs, which might be evi-
dent through their presumed motives, the way they conduct
themselves, and the degree of certainty with which they
express their views (boldness of language).

Attitudinal Characteristics of Sceptics
Different Motivations and Modes
Some observers have tried to distinguish between sceptics on
the basis of their motivations and, consequently, the modes
they have chosen for airing their views. Most of these
attempts are premised on the argument that some sceptics are
merely using their climate views to advance their material
and/or ideological interests, and because of this deception,
they should be considered qualitatively different to those
who are truly mistaken or misguided about the climate issue.
Painter thinks it is useful to distinguish between "organ-
ised scepticism linked to well-funded bodies" and "individ-
ual sceptic(s) with no such links" (Painter, 2012, p. 198).
Powell (cited in Walker, 2014) distinguishes between "pro-
fessional science deniers" who do it for money or ideological
reasons and scientists who are "contrarian by nature," who
revel in being different and provocative and seriously believe
they are advancing the science by questioning the orthodox-
ies. This typology is closely replicated by Diethelm and
McKee's (2009) distinction between those driven by "greed,"
"ideology," or "faith" and those driven by "eccentricity and
idiosyncrasy" (p. 3). Rahmstorf (2005) proposes three scep-
tic "archetypes": paid lobbyists (those in the pay of fossil
fuel interests), Don Quixotists (those who are "emotionally
committed"), and eccentrics (scholars from other scientific
disciplines) (p. 79). Hamilton (2014) offers three categories
of sceptics based on their inner motives: first, the manufac-
turers of doubt, who deceive the public with their lies; sec-
ond, the repeaters of the lies, who amplify the views of the
manufacturers for political and personal reasons; and third,
the consumers of the lies (the public), who are seduced by
the manufacturers and repeaters and resort to "casual denial"
for any number of psychological reasons.
What these different typologies have in common is that
they make a basic distinction between those who have ulte-
rior motives with their climate scepticism and those who are
simply mistaken and/or misguided. For many observers, this
is an important distinction because it adds a moral dimension
to their analysis. It is a distinction fraught with danger
though. It would be extremely difficult (impossible indeed)
to factually show or in some other way objectively assess
someone's inner motivations, especially when the person in
question is suspected of being disingenuous. And by assign-
ing some inner extraepistemic motivation to participants in
the debate, by claiming some corruption of the mind by
money, ideology, or politics, resentment and polarisation in
the climate debate is merely perpetuated and exacerbated.
A distinction cast, though, between original thinkers (the
originators of sceptic critique) and the propagators or repro-
ducers of their thinking, might circumvent the problem of
inner motivation and moral character, without blunting the
accountability of the most egregious sceptics for their
actions. Pendergraft (1998) conceives of "scientists" and

"prophets" in the climate change debate, where the scientists
are supposed to make the "sober" claims and the prophets
amplify and moralise such claims (p. 645). The underlying
assumption of such a distinction is that the originators actu-
ally scrutinised the science and that the reproducers are
accepting what they say on trust and intuition. A greater
onus, therefore, rests on the originators to get their science
right, particularly if they arrive at antithetical conclusions.
They can and should be judged to a higher standard because
they speak from some position of authority and command the
trust of others.
Different Certainties of Belief
There are qualitative differences between someone who
emphatically rejects the mainstream climate thesis, someone
who disputes aspects of it, someone who feels doubtful, and
someone who feels undecided (agnostic). Most common in
the literature is a twofold distinction between "rejectionists"
(those who dismiss the mainstream climate thesis or key
aspects of it outright) and those who are uncertain or harbor
reservations about the veracity of the scientific claims. In a
study of public opinion in the United States, Leiserowitz,
Maibach, and Roser-Renouf (2009) found a range of seven
climate change opinion categories,4 two of which correspond
to climate change scepticism, namely, "doubtful" and "dis-
missive." The "dismissive" category differs from the doubt-
ful category in terms of the strength of their belief and their
active engagement of the issue (Leiserowitz et al., 2009, p.
4). Cook et al. (2013) distinguish between those "uncertain"
of the mainstream thesis and those "rejecting" it (p. 3).
Painter's (2012) typology talks of those holding a "falsely
balanced view" (not knowing what to believe) and those
holding a "dismissive view" (believing that the climate is not
changing or that humans are not responsible for changes) (p.
193). Hoffman (2011) distinguishes between a more passive
"sceptical" group that is doubtful about climate change and a
much more active and organised "denier" group that is work-
ing to discredit climate change science (p. 5). The distinction
between rejectionists/dismissers and doubters provides a
good measure of the intensity of their beliefs, for the rejec-
tionists are unlikely to embark on the level of activism and
categorical denial characteristic of their group if they did not
hold such beliefs deeply. Studies have, in fact, found that
certainty of belief is an important distinguishing quality
between groups of sceptics, with the rejectionists feeling
very certain about their views, whereas those who are uncer-
tain/reserved feel less certain about their views (Leiserowitz
et al., 2009; Whitmarsh, 2011).
The reject/dismiss category is stable and does not reduce
to subcategories. The doubtful category, however, subdivides
in multiple ways, depending on the analyst's preferences.
Leiserowitz et al.'s (2009) "doubtful" category is subdivided
into three: those believing in the trend of climate change but
not its human cause and seriousness, those not believing in
the trend, and those who don't know (p. 4). Brin (2010a,
2010b) identifies three sceptic groups that are distinct from
the extreme category, namely, climate agnostics, climate
denial followers (the gullible, "koolaid-drinking" tools of a
propaganda machine), and rational, open-minded, prosci-
ence people who are motivated by curiosity to ask legitimate
questions of the mainstream thesis.
There is no easy way to describe and identify the finer
distinctions among the doubtful sceptics. Several problems
are apparent. First, how do we "spot" or "prove" a sceptic if
the individual is very circumspect in his or her views and
adept at expressing them in sophisticated ways. And even if
someone's scepticism is quite apparent from his or her public
expressions, how do we know to what degree he or she has
tailored the tone and explicitness of his or her expressions to
the audience? Second, what amount of criticism and what
tone would place one sceptic in a more extreme category
than another? How do we distinguish between the incessant,
vocal, and brazen sceptic on one hand and the occasional
sceptic voice on the other if they share exactly the same criti-
cisms? And finally, people can be inconsistent when they
express their views. Their arguments might be convoluted, or
they might modify their views over time--the so-called
"water sloshing in a shallow pan" effect described by Revkin
(2010). When individuals are ambiguous in their views,
which expression at which point in time would mark the per-
son as a particular type of sceptic?
These problems should not preclude us from trying to dis-
entangle the sceptic phenomenon in terms of the different
qualities and intensities of belief of sceptics. Before attempt-
ing to capture these differences in a taxonomy, the next sec-
tion first highlights the complexity of settling on a label that
unites the sceptic category and that does not foreclose options
for further subclassification.
Labeling Complexities
Although there might be general agreement about who quali-
fies as "climate change sceptics," the label sceptic is con-
tested. Climate sceptics claim the label because they believe
they are simply fulfilling the inclination and duty of any true
scientist, that they are in fact serving science with their scep-
ticism, and that the mainstream scientists are the ones stuck
in a rut of groupthink, captive to the vested interests that
have accumulated around a supposed climate change "indus-
try" (Carter, 2008). In contrast, various scholars argue that
the "scepticism" practiced by climate change sceptics is not
scepticism in the true sense of the word, and that the label is
a misnomer (Anderegg, 2010a, p. 30; Antilla, 2005, p. 339
fn. 5; Brin, 2010b; Cook & Washington, 2011, pp. 1-2;
Dunlap & McCright, 2011, p. 156 n. 1; Hamilton, 2010,
p. 117; O'Neill & Boykoff, 2010, p. E151).
As a consequence, scholars have been looking for alterna-
tive labels for the sceptic phenomenon. A popular alternative
is climate change or global warming "denial," which
Van Rensburg 9
scholars have tried to ground theoretically (see Cook &
Washington, 2011; Diethelm & McKee, 2009; Dunlap, 2013;
Hoofnagle, 2007; McCright & Dunlap, 2010; Nuccitelli,
2013; Specter, 2009; Walker, 2014). Yet, its unfortunate con-
notation with Holocaust denial, indiscriminate use, and com-
monsense meaning have all caused serious trouble in the
climate debate. Sceptics find the label extremely divisive, to
the degree that responses to the label foreclose any meaning-
ful debate. When asked what it would take for him to accept
the orthodox position on climate change, Anthony Watts, the
creator of one of the most visited sceptic blogs on the
Internet, Watts Up With That, responded that a "starting
point for the process" would not begin with more facts but
instead with a public apology from the high profile scientists
who have labeled him and his colleagues "deniers"
(Merchant, 2011). Politicians who have had to navigate the
climate issue also reflect on the counterproductive effect of
the label, like formerAustralian Prime Minister John Howard
(2013):
Increasingly offensive language is used. The most egregious
example has been the term "denier." We are all aware of the
particular meaning that word has acquired in contemporary
parlance. It has been employed in this debate with some malice
aforethought.
The denial label is, strictly speaking, misrepresenting the
sceptic view. The majority of climate sceptics accept that the
climate is changing; many of them agree that human activi-
ties are playing a part in the phenomenon, and a select few
would even concede that humans might be the dominant
cause of current climate trends (the so-called impact scep-
tics). The trend­attribution­impact typology, in fact, implies
that sceptics are disagreeing with parts (rarely all) of the
mainstream climate thesis. Furthermore, critique of per-
ceived exaggerations of climate claims, rather than outright
denial, is a central feature of sceptic discourse. Whitmarsh
(2011) found that the perception that media communication
of climate change is alarmist is the single most common
characteristic among sceptics. It is, therefore, not surprising
that sceptics would rhetorically exploit the semblant misrep-
resentation behind the denier label. By emphatically arguing
their acceptance of climate change and a human contribution
to it, they are ostensibly positioning themselves closer to the
mainstream science, portraying their own views as critical
improvements of the science, and discrediting their detrac-
tors for misrepresenting them by calling them climate change
deniers.
Another alternative label in limited use is "contrarian"
(see Boykoff & Olson, 2013; Brisman, 2012, p. 42; Dunlap
& McCright, 2011; Henson, 2011, p. 269; Nuccitelli, 2013).
It carries two commonsense meanings, namely, a position of
fact, such as in the Oxford Dictionaries (2013): "opposing or
rejecting popular opinion or current practice," or an attitude,
such as in the Collins English Dictionary (2013): a "contrary
or obstinate person." It is not an ideal term because of its low
currency (Painter, 2012) and of its connotation with flip-
pancy and obstinacy, which applies to a good number of
sceptics but certainly not to all. Finally, Jones (2011) pro-
poses "confusionists" as an appropriate label because it best
describes the main goal of climate change scepticism,
namely, to promote confusion among the public.
In most cases, an observer's choice of label is probably
fairly arbitrary. It is likely that many observers simply persist
with the commonly used "sceptic" for purely pragmatic rea-
sons while acknowledging its messy relationship with labels
like "denier" and "contrarian" (Antilla, 2005, p. 339 fn. 5;
McCright & Dunlap, 2003; Painter, 2012, p. 196).
The article now turns to the task of selecting and justify-
ing categories and labels to describe different qualities of
scepticism and organising these in a taxonomy.
Proposal for a Taxonomy
For the overall category, preference is given to Anderegg,
Schneider, Harold, and Prall's (2010) label, "unconvinced of
the evidence (UE)" (p. 12107)5 It accurately reflects the epis-
temic position of the full range of sceptics, from the agnostic/
undecided and doubtful to those who actively dispute or
reject some or all of the core mainstream claims. The label
unconvinced avoids contestation over the badge scepticism,
the positive scientific norm to which both sides in the debate
are laying claim to. Avoiding the "scepticism/sceptic" badge
altogether would help to limit tangential arguments about
who are truly following the scientific tradition, and would
deny the semblance of credibility enjoyed by sceptics, many
of whom in actual fact practice a very low standard of scien-
tific scepticism.
Subcategorisations are shown in Table 2. At the first level
of subcategorisation, the scheme accommodates the wide
agreement among scholars and observers that there is a sig-
nificant qualitative difference between the most extreme
sceptics and the rest, hence the uncertain­reject dichotomy.
It is appropriate to use the label uncertain to separate the
milder forms of scepticism from the rejectionists. The rejec-
tionists represent the most vociferous and blatant sceptic per-
suasions. They are also far from uncertain in their views.
Studies have shown that those at the most extreme end of the
scepticism scale feel very confident in their dismissal of cli-
mate change evidence (Leiserowitz et al., 2009; Whitmarsh,
2011). The taxonomy steers clear of the labels denier and
contrarian due to their semantic connotations to Holocaust
denial and personal pettiness.
The third and final level of subcategorisation subdivides
the "uncertain" group into agnostics, doubters, and disputers
to reflect varying degrees and intensities of scepticism in this
group. Including the agnostic/undecided here alongside the
doubters and disputers is justified because the net effect of
their position is the same as that of the other sceptics, namely,
nonacceptance of core climate change claims that should be
10 SAGE Open
beyond doubt, given the established and advanced nature of
the science, the exceptionally high degree of scientific con-
sensus prevailing, and the severity of the problem. The dis-
tinctions drawn in the taxonomy are, admittedly, subjective,
but they are necessary to capture finer nuances in the sceptic
phenomenon.
The proposed taxonomy reflects different intensities of
climate change scepticism. For instance, a person emphati-
cally rejecting the entire mainstream climate thesis is more
likely to hold such views strongly and to actively chal-
lenge mainstream science than someone who is merely
doubtful of some key claims. A degree of mobility between
these categories can be assumed. For instance, it is con-
ceivable that extraneous events like a particularly hot sum-
mer may shift someone from "doubtful" to "undecided"
and vice versa. The most extreme end of the spectrum can
be expected to be stable because the individuals at this
position are likely to have rationalised their views at length
and may find themselves heavily invested in this position
in terms of professional prestige and opportunities for pub-
lic exposure. Unavoidably, the labels are open to some
degree of interpretation and are not entirely mutually
exclusive. They do draw recognisable distinctions though,
and dispose of the two most problematic ones, namely,
"sceptic" and "denier."
Conclusion
This article proposes a conceptual design of climate change
scepticism that might help an observer to draw both gross
and subtle distinctions in the phenomenon. The evidence
challenge is placed at the core of what it means to be a cli-
mate sceptic, with concomitant objects of scepticism moved
to more neutral conceptual ground. The different certainties
of sceptic belief are also relabeled for greater semantic accu-
racy and to dispose of toxic labels. These design elements
might help to counter the potential pitfalls in prevailing
assessments of climate scepticism, noted at the beginning of
the article, and might provide important pointers for those
concerned with meeting the sceptic challenge.
First, renewed recognition of the nuances in the sceptic
phenomenon might help to counter the unintended but
unfortunate ideologising of the debate that had occurred due
to the intense interest in the extraepistemic drivers of scepti-
cism. Much of the mainstream response to climate change
scepticism fail to convince sceptics precisely because the
science is skirted for the sake of a grand theory that casts
sceptics as ill-intentioned rather than ill-informed. And once
the motivations of a participant are questioned, there could
hardly be any chance of constructive dialogue and critique
that might improve the quality of the science, the articula-
tion of the science, or the debate in general. The right­
wrong, serious­disingenuous dichotomies that dominate so
much of the debate has made it difficult to engage sceptics
in a discerning fashion, to direct chagrin at the egregious
sceptic arguments, and give leeway and credit to those scep-
tic arguments made in good faith. Pigeonholing sceptics
who are sincerely concerned about aspects of the science
with those who are egregious and entrenched in their scepti-
cism has an unnecessarily polarising and politicising effect
on the participants in the debate and their followers.
Second, greater awareness of the distinction between core
and concomitant objects of scepticism might encourage
observers and policy practitioners to target their responses.
Climate change scepticism hinges on the evidential chal-
lenge. Without a credible (in the eyes of the broader public)
evidential challenge, either through direct contestation of the
physical evidence or doubts about the evidence inferred from
perceived process or response deficiencies, climate change
scepticism unravels. By focusing on the core (and presum-
ably refutable) sceptic challenges, observers and policy prac-
titioners might avoid getting drawn into the ultimately
political and moral debates typical of sceptics' extended cri-
tiques. Sceptics have in the past benefited from the resonance
that their policy critiques have enjoyed among nonsceptic or
apathetic partisans who oppose incisive climate mitigation
measures, for various reasons. Without negating the potential
value of addressing sceptics' extended arguments (i.e.,
against incisive climate mitigation) in creative ways, the
value of a focused, resolute, and sustained response to scep-
tics' evidence claims should not be underestimated. It could
be argued that the evidence debate provides a neutral and
stable access point to sceptics and that successful engage-
ment of sceptics on purely evidence-related matters would
flow on to affect the credibility of sceptics' extended
arguments.
Third, systematising and formalising the task of classifying
and labeling sceptics (by use of the two taxonomies) might
make it easier to distinguish between those sceptics who stand
closer to the mainstream view, and might be amenable to

argumentation methods and communication strategies, and
those who are too extreme and entrenched in their views.
Finally, relocating sceptics' critiques of the scientific and
bureaucratic processes behind mainstream climate science
and the implied response imperatives of the mainstream the-
sis to more neutral conceptual ground "unmerges" the scep-
tic identity and reclaims these issues as legitimate concerns
for everyone, not just sceptics. By lowering the defenses on
these issues, it might be possible to dislodge the perception
that sceptics are the drivers of public reticence and political
indecision in climate matters. By treating the process and
response issues as areas of legitimate disputation rather than
an elaborate complex of sceptic provocation, observers and
policy practitioners might demonstrate their commitment to
a careful and thorough test of ideas, which might be all that
is needed to convince those sceptics who are uncertain rather
than dismissive of mainstream climate science.
Future Research
Capstick and Pidgeon's (2014) recent investigation of the
climate change scepticism concept detected a latent con-
struct in the general population's view about climate change,
which they call "folk psychology." This construct includes
intuitive lay assumptions about human nature, such as "peo-
ple are too selfish to do anything about climate change" and
"it is not in human nature to respond to problems that won't
happen for many years" (Capstick & Pidgeon, 2014, p. 396).
Van Rensburg (2013) identified a host of myths of human
nature that are particularly recurrent in sceptic discourse, like
humans are intelligent, resourceful, resilient, and able to
adapt to changing environments, yet are also limited in their
true ability to understand, let alone influence or control, the
complex and powerful global climatic system. It is not sur-
prising that these notions are present in the context of climate
sceptical thought for they serve an integrative purpose and
provide continuity between received information and innate
information. However, it could be argued that folk psychol-
ogy constructs are independently important, that is, that they
immediately orient people when they are confronted with the
climate issue and that they powerfully colour received infor-
mation about the evidence, processes, and responses to do
with climate change. If that were the case, folk psychology
might be identified as a key center of climate scepticism
(fourth center?), with implications for our conceptual under-
standing of the phenomenon.

Notes
1. A note on terminology: "Climate change" is used as shorthand
for human-caused or anthropogenic climate change. Because
the element of human causation is so central to the climate
issue, its specification in the label is generally regarded unnec-
essary. The term is equivalent to the mostly U.S. use of "global
warming." In regard to the labels "scepticism" and "sceptics,"
this article argues for more nuanced terminology; however, in
the interests of familiarity to the reader, they are used from the
outset. These terms enjoy wide currency in scholarly, media,
and popular discourse, and several prominent writers belong-
ing to the category self-describe as "sceptics" (Painter, 2012,
p. 196).
2. The first installment of AR5, its Working Group 1 report,
was published in September 2013. In terms of core claims,
this report corresponds very closely with AR4. It is not used
as reference in this article because the examples of sceptic
claims analysed here were made in the context of the AR4
report.
3. The label concomitant is preferred as its dictionary meaning
suggests that it accompanies a preceding object and often in a
"lesser," "subordinate," or "incidental" way (2014a, 2014b).
4. The so-called seven climate change "audiences" are labeled
alarmed, concerned, cautious, disengaged, doubtful, and
dismissive.
5. Although I propose that the label unconvinced should replace
the label sceptic for the overall category, I have no illusions
about the semantic appeal of the compound "climate change
sceptic(ism)" or its entrenchment in popular and scholarly use.
I would hope, though, that in time the label unconvinced would
bring more clarity to the discussion.
