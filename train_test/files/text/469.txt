In mammalian females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated in early embryonic life. Females are therefore mosaics for
two cell populations, one with the maternal and one with the paternal X as the active X chromosome. A skewed X inactivation is
a marked deviation from a 50:50 ratio. In populations of women past 55­60 years of age, an increased degree of skewing (DS)
is found. Here the association between age-related skewing and mortality is analyzed in a 13-year follow-up study of 500 women
from three cohorts (73­100 years of age at intake). Women with low DS had significantly higher mortality than the majority of
women who had a more skewed DS (hazard ratio: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.04­1.64). The association between X inactivation and
mortality was replicated in dizygotic twin pairs for which the co-twin with the lowest DS also had a statistically significant
tendency to die first in the twin pairs with the highest intra-pair differences in DS (proportion: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.52­0.86). Both
results suggest that lower DS is associated with higher mortality. We therefore propose that age-related skewing may be partly
due to a population selection with lower mortality among those with higher DS.

INTRODUCTION
The biological phenomenon of X-chromosome inactivation is
observed in females across a variety of mammalian species. Females
have two X chromosomes, of which either the maternal or the paternal
X is inactivated in early embryonic life, at about the time of
implantation.1 Females are therefore mosaics for two cell populations,
one with the maternal and one with the paternal X as the active
X chromosome. Early in life the two cell populations are normally
distributed around a 50:50 ratio.2,3 In some females, one of the two
cell populations is more abundant than the other and the value of the
larger proportion is called the degree of skewing (DS), with DSZ50.
DS¼50 is therefore a complete random X inactivation and DS¼100 is
a completely skewed X inactivation. X inactivation is believed to occur
randomly for each cell and to be permanent for all descendants of the
cell. For women younger than 55­60 years of age, DS does not increase
significantly with age in populations2,3 or within the same individual.4
However, DS increases considerably with age in cross-sectional studies
of populations older than 55­60 years and this age association
continues to increase in populations at the most advanced ages.2,3,5
Most X-inactivation studies have been performed on peripheral blood
cells, but a higher frequency of skewed X inactivation in elderly
women has also been found in buccal swab cells.6,7
Most X-inactivation studies use an indirect assay targeted to a
methylation site and polymorphic sequence named the HUMARA
assay. The representativeness of this indirect method for studying
X inactivation has been questioned. Recently, however, skewing of
X inactivation in aging women was confirmed by two transcriptional-
based assays.8
There are two main hypotheses as to why DS increases with age in
cross-sectional studies. One is that DS increases with age within the
same individual and the other is that DS is associated with life
expectancy in women. Only weak evidence has been published for
the first hypothesis, while the latter hypothesis has not been studied
previously. In this study, we aim to test the survival hypothesis by
investigating whether DS is associated with mortality. We therefore
conducted a 13-year follow-up study of women aged 73­100 years to
investigate the relationship between DS and mortality registered in a
nationwide database register. In addition, the study was replicated by
the analysis of a subset of the sample using the statistically powerful
twin intra-pair analysis, which also controls for genetic and familial
environmental factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
The subjects were female participants of three population-based nationwide
surveys conducted at the University of Southern Denmark: The Longitudinal
Study of Aging Danish Twins (LSADT), The Danish 1905 Cohort Study and the
Danish Centenarian Study.
LSADT is a longitudinal study of Danish twins aged 70 years and older. The
study was initiated in 1995, and the survey was repeated in 1997, 1999, 2001,
2003 and 2005. The subjects in this study were participants from the 1997
survey, in which full blood samples were taken, and included 78 monozygotic
(MZ) and 92 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs.
The Danish 1905 Cohort Study is a prospective investigation of an entire
birth cohort. The survey was initiated in 1998, when the participants were
92­93 years old and comprised of follow-up studies in 2000, 2003 and 2005.
Of the 3600 individuals still alive at intake, 118 women provided full blood

samples in 1998 and were included in this study. Each survey of the LSADTand
the 1905 Cohort Study comprises multidimensional face-to-face interviews
focusing on health and lifestyle issues, as well as objective assessments of
cognitive and physical abilities.9­11
The Danish Centenarian Study is a nationwide epidemiological survey of all
persons living in Denmark who celebrated their 100th birthday during a
14-month period from 1995 to 1996. A year and a half later, 21 participants
were still alive and were revisited. These were included in this study. All three
studies were approved by the Danish Scientific­Ethical Committees.
X-chromosome inactivation
DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using standard procedures.
The X-chromosome inactivation pattern has been determined previously by
a PCR analysis of a polymorphic CAG repeat and a methylation-sensitive site in
the androgen receptor gene.3,5,12 The DS was defined as a number between
50 and 495, where 50 indicates a random X-inactivation pattern and 495 an
extremely skewed pattern, where most or all cells had either the maternal or the
paternal X as the active X chromosome. The most common thresholds of X
inactivation are a DS above 75, 80 or 90. However, using a predefined grouping
of a quantitative measure forces the outcome a priori to be similar in the
groups, despite what the data supports. Hence, we grouped DS into quartiles,
which is a more flexible way to analyze the association between X inactivation
and mortality having no previous assumption of the association.
Survival
Each participant was followed from the baseline interview date until
31 December 2009, in the Danish Civil Registration system, which registers
date of death.13 Hence, there was no loss to follow-up as none of the
participants emigrated.
Statistical analyses
Cox's proportional hazards models were performed to study the association
between DS and mortality. A linear model was applied with DS as a continuous
variable, and in order to take into account potential nonlinearity, DS was
divided into quartiles. Since the mortality was similar in the second, third and
fourth quartile, we also analyzed the association between mortality and DS
divided into the first quartile and the others. Those in the first lower quartile
(50rDSr63) are referred to as low DS and those in the upper three quartiles
(DS464) as skewed X inactivation. In all models, age was the underlying
timescale and risk was assessed from the age at blood sampling to age at death
or end of follow-up at the end of 2009, whatever came first, thereby adjusting
for age.14 Alternative models also adjusted for physical and cognitive function-
ing measures, which are strong predictors of survival among elderly and the
oldest-old.15
As the data partly pertain to twin pairs, and because observation within twin
pairs might be correlated, the Cox's proportional hazards models were
performed using the robust estimator of variance, assuming independence
between pairs.16 The proportional hazard assumption underlying the Cox
models was tested using the Schoenfeld residual test and fulfilled the require-
ments for the Cox model.
Intra-pair analyses were performed by calculating the proportion of times
the co-twin who had the lowest DS died first. This proportion was compared to
the null hypothesis of equality (50/50) by using the standard binomial test. We
analyzed trends with a conditional logistic regression to study the association
between increasing intra-pair DS and survival, and tested for interaction terms
between twin pairs age, zygosity and intra-pair DS. Statistical analyses were
carried out using Stata 10.1 (STATA Corp., College Station, TX, USA).
RESULTS
The LSADT twins, the 1905 Cohort members and the centenarians
comprised together 500 female participants. After the follow-up
period of 13 years, 223 of 361 (62%) of the twins and all except
two of the 118 (98%) from the 1905 Cohort Study were deceased.
After 6 years of follow-up, all 21 centenarians were deceased. In total,
72% of the 500 participants died during follow-up (Table 1).
The hazard ratio of DS estimated as a linear effect showed
tendencies to lower hazard ratio by approximately 4% per 10 DS
(hazard ratio: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.89­1.02). However, as Table 2 shows,
women with low DS (1 quartile) had a higher hazard compared to
women in the other quartiles, which indicate that the association is
properly not linear in the entire DS range. Women with low DS had a
significantly higher hazard compared with the majority of women in
the three top quartiles who had a more skewed X inactivation (hazard
ratio: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.04­1.64), that is, women with low DS had a 30%
higher mortality risk during the 13-year follow-up period. The hazard
ratios were similar and the analysis of low DS versus a more skewed
X inactivation was still statistically significant after adjustment for
cognitive and physical abilities.
Of the 170 twin pairs, where both co-twins participated, 10 pairs
were discarded from further analysis because their DS was identical.
For 127 of the remaining 160 pairs, one or both of the twins had died,
and of these 59 were MZ and 68 were DZ twin pairs. Figure 1 shows
that for DZ twins with a difference in DS of more than 13 (top 50%),
the twin with the lowest DS died first in 71% of the pairs (proportion:
0.71; 95% CI: 0.52­0.86). Regression analysis showed that increase in
intra-pair difference of DS was associated with increased mortality risk
(P¼0.019). When all 68 DZ twin pairs were included, the twin with
the lowest DS died first in 60% of the pairs (proportion: 0.60; 95% CI:
0.48­0.72). For MZ twins, there was no evidence that it was more

common that the twin with the lowest DS died first (proportion: 0.56;
95% CI: 0.42­0.69) and in agreement regression analysis showed
significant interaction between zygosity and DS (P¼0.038), suggesting
that genetic factors could be the basis for the DS­mortality association
seen in twins.17
DISCUSSION
The life expectancy for both women and men has increased in
developed countries over the past two centuries. Twin studies have
shown that genetic factors account for approximately 25% of the
variance in human lifespan. The genetic influences on lifespan are
minimal before the age of 60 years, but increase thereafter and appear
to be biggest at the most advanced ages.18,19 Presently, the e4 allele of
the APOE gene is the only known common variant with a substantial
effect on survival at advanced age,20 whereas others, such as the
FOXO3A gene, have a modest effect.21 Telomere length is also
associated with both age-related changes and mortality, but is not a
strong predictor for the remaining lifespan.22 These genetic and
epigenetic factors are mostly identical for women and men.22,23
Uniquely for women, life expectancies could be as a result of the
mosaicism caused by X inactivation, as they have a choice between two
cell populations.24
In this study, a 13-year follow-up study of 73­101-year-old parti-
cipants in the three cohorts showed that mortality was higher for
females with a low DS (50rDSr63) compared to females with a
more skewed pattern (DS463). As our analyses were carried out
without an a priori hypothesis of association with mortality, and our
analysis did not include correction for multiple testing, it cannot be
ruled out that our finding is caused by a Type 1 error. However, the
evidence was strengthened by the association between mortality and
lower DS in an intra-pair analysis using the most discordant DZ twin
pairs, although the association was not found in MZ twin pairs.
Previous twin studies have shown that DS intra-class correlation is
significantly higher for MZ twins than for DZ twins, indicating a
genetic effect on DS, and X-inactivation pattern has a heritability of
0.63 in young and 0.58 in elderly twins.3 This heritability indicates that
the age-related skewing of X inactivation could be determined by a
selection for or against cells with a particular X chromosome as the
active X chromosome.
There are many clinical examples of selective advantages in X-linked
disorders. In the X-linked adrenal leukodystrophy, there is a selective
advantage of the cell carrying the mutated gene on the active
X chromosome.25 In most cases, the cell carrying the wild-type gene
on the active X has a selective advantage, leading to a totally skewed
X inactivation in the carrier, for example, as reported for Wiskott­
Aldrich syndrome.26 However, in these examples selection probably
starts very early in life. A different situation is found in some X-linked
anemias, where the age-related skewing leads to the manifestation of
the disease in elderly female carriers.27­29
These selection processes in X-linked disorders do not explain why
the frequency of the age-related skewed X inactivation has been shown
to be higher in females 455­60 years of age in several cross-sectional
studies.2,3,5 Likewise, these processes do not explain why females with
low DS have higher mortality compared to those with a more skewed
pattern. It is possible that one or more genes affect both the DS and
longevity, for example, because association between DS and mortality
was marked in intra-pair analyses of DZ twin compared to MZ twins.

age had DS above 80 compared with 67% of centenarians.5 This
substantial difference in the proportion of women with high DS
cannot be explained by the 30% higher mortality risk observed in
the current follow-up study for women with DS in the lowest quartile,
because mortality is not associated with increased DS beyond the
lowest quartile; that is, there is no mortality difference between
second, third and fourth quartile (Table 2). However, we cannot
exclude that our study does not have the power to detect such an
association. The age-related increase is likely to be caused mainly by
individual increases in DS with age. However, the reduced number of
elderly with low DS (lowest quartile) could at least partly be due to
population selection by mortality. Few studies of longitudinal mea-
surements of X inactivation in the same females over time have been
reported. X-inactivation pattern analyzed in peripheral granulocytes,
monocytes and T cells in 35 blood donors aged 20­75 years was not
significantly different in repeated measures of samples drawn
18 months later.30 The authors concluded that no fluctuation of
X-inactivation pattern occurred in these blood cells in this time
period. Similarly, no differences were found between most of the
samples taken about two decades apart from 178 females aged 5­75
years. Only in the few samples where the age at the time of the second
sampling was more than 60 years, a tendency to a more skewed
X inactivation in the second sample was found.4 Thus, there is little
evidence that skewing of X inactivation in individuals with age is a
common phenomenon, at least before the age of 60 years. Individual
changes of skewing of X inactivation over time at more advanced ages
thus remains to be confirmed in longitudinal studies.
Our results should be replicated; however, we propose that age-
related skewed X inactivation may be partly due to population
selection with lower mortality among those with higher DS. Since
this selection scenario is unique for women, it would be most relevant
to study skewed X inactivation and its relation to common age-related
diseases. Little is known about X inactivation and common diseases,
except for breast cancer, which has been widely studied, but with
inconsistent results.31­35
