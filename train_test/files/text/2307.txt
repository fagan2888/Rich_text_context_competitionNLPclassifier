Nonfatal Choking on Food Among Children 14 Years
or Younger in the United States, 2001­2009
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: In 2001, an estimated 10 438
children were treated in US emergency departments for nonfatal
choking on food. The foods most frequently associated with
pediatric fatal choking are hot dogs, seeds, nuts, candy, and
certain types of fruits and vegetables.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: From 2001 through 2009, an estimated
annual average of 12 435 children ages 0 to 14 years were treated
in US emergency departments for nonfatal choking on food; 0- to
4-year-olds accounted for 61.7% of episodes. Foods most
frequently involved were candy, meat, bone, and fruits/vegetables.
abstract
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the epidemi-
ology of nonfatal choking on food among US children.
METHODS: Using a nationally representative sample, nonfatal pediatric
choking-related emergency department (ED) visits involving food for
2001 through 2009 were analyzed by using data from the National
Electronic Injury Surveillance System­All Injury Program. Narratives
abstracted from the medical record were reviewed to identify choking
cases and the types of food involved.
RESULTS: An estimated 111 914 (95% confidence interval: 83 975­139
854) children ages 0 to 14 years were treated in US hospital EDs from
2001 through 2009 for nonfatal food-related choking, yielding an
average of 12 435 children annually and a rate of 20.4 (95% confidence
interval: 15.4­25.3) visits per 100 000 population. The mean age of children
treated for nonfatal food-related choking was 4.5 years. Children aged
#1 year accounted for 37.8% of cases, and male children accounted for
more than one-half (55.4%) of cases. Of all food types, hard candy was
most frequently (15.5% [16 168 cases]) associated with choking, followed
by other candy (12.8% [13 324]), meat (12.2% [12 671]), and bone (12.0%
[12 496]). Most patients (87.3% [97 509]) were treated and released, but
10.0% (11 218) were hospitalized, and 2.6% (2911) left against medical
advice.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first nationally representative study to focus
solely on nonfatal pediatric food-related choking treated in US EDs over
a multiyear period. Improved surveillance, food labeling and redesign,
and public education are strategies that can help reduce pediatric
choking on food. Pediatrics 2013;132:275­281

ARTICLE
Choking on food and nonfood sub-
stances is a leading cause of childhood
morbidity and mortality. In 2001, an
estimated 17 537 children ages 0 to 14
years were treated in US emergency
departments (EDs) for a nonfatal
choking episode involving food or
nonfood substances.1 Nonfood items
often responsible for nonfatal choking
episodes among children include toys
and coins.2­7 In recent decades, the US
Consumer Product Safety Commission
(CPSC) has responded to the problem
of hazardous toys by issuing numerous
safety recalls and regulations. In 1994,
the Federal Hazardous Substances Act
(FHSA) was amended by the Child
Safety Protection Act to require chok-
ing hazard warning labels on packag-
ing for small balls, balloons, marbles,
and other toys and games that contain
small parts when these items are
intended for use by children in defined
age groups.8 This act also bans any
toy intended for use by children aged
,3 years that may pose a choking,
aspiration, or ingestion hazard. In addi-
tion, the FHSA defines test of an object
size by using the small-parts test fixture,
which simulates the mouth and pharynx
of a small child.4 An object is considered
a small part if it fits completely within
the small-parts test fixture. Finally, the
Consumer Product Safety Improvement
Act of 2008 amended the FHSA to require
choking hazard warnings to be dis-
played on or adjacent to Internet or
printed product advertisements that
provide a direct means for purchasing
a product for which the FHSA requires
a warning.4
Despite these improvements in the
safety and labeling of nonfood items
distributed for children, studies have
continually shown that the majority
of foreign bodies that cause choking-
related injuries are not toys but
foods.1,2,9­12 Of the estimated 17 537
nonfatal choking episodes reported
among children ages 0 to 14 years in
2001, more than one-half (59.5% [10
438]) were associated with a food
substance; candy/gum was the most
frequently cited food item.1 Food ac-
counted for 75.7% of nonfatal choking-
related episodes among children ages
5 to 14 years, 58.4% among children ages
1 to 4 years, and 52.1% among children
age ,1 year.1 According to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), an average of 57 deaths among
children ages 0 to 14 years due to in-
halation and ingestion of food causing
obstruction of the respiratory tract oc-
curred each year from 2001 through
2009.13 High-risk foods presenting fatal
and nonfatal choking hazards to children
include hot dogs, hard candy, nuts/
seeds, certain raw fruits and vegeta-
bles, and chewing gum.4­7,9,10,14,15 These
foods that present a choking risk to
children share many of the physical
characteristics often described for
high-risk toys: cylindrical in shape,
airway sized, and compressible,
allowing a tight and complete occlu-
sion of a child's airway. Despite the
frequency of pediatric food-related chok-
ing, and the risk similarities to haz-
ardous toys, choking on food remains
a relatively underaddressed problem
in the United States.
To the best of our knowledge, the cur-
rent study is the first to comprehen-
sively investigate nonfatal food-related
choking among children treated in US
EDs over a multiyear period. The pre-
vious study by the CDC evaluated non-
fatal choking episodes among children
due to food and nonfood items during
only a single year (ie, 2001).1 The current
study provides a much more in-depth
analysis of nonfatal food-related chok-
ing over a 9-year period.
METHODS
Data Source
Nonfatal food-related choking data an-
alyzed in this study were obtained from
the National Electronic Injury Surveil-
lance System­All Injury Program
(NEISS-AIP). The NEISS is operated by
the CPSC to provide nationally repre-
sentative data on consumer product­
related ED visits using a stratified
probability sample of 100 hospitals,
including 7 children's hospitals, which
have 24-hour EDs with at least 6 beds in
the United States and its territories.16
The NEISS-AIP is a nationally represen-
tative subsample of 66 of the NEISS
hospitals, which collects data on all
types and external causes of nonfatal
injuries treated in the participating
EDs, regardless of consumer product
involvement. Each year, the NEISS-AIP
collects data on 500 000 injury-
related ED visits. Trained NEISS-AIP
coders review all ED medical records
at participating hospitals daily to ex-
tract data, including age, gender, prin-
cipal diagnosis, primary body region
affected (eg, airway-related events for
the current study), consumer products
involved (eg, food for the current study),
disposition at ED discharge, locale
where the event occurred, and a short
narrative abstracted from the medical
record describing the precipitating
event for each patient. Sample weights
are applied to provide national esti-
mates of nonfatal injuries treated in
US hospital EDs.16
Data Selection
A food-related choking case for the
current study was defined as any
nonfatalchokingeventpresenting toan
NEISS-AIP hospital ED for children aged
#14 years in which the patient choked
on or aspirated a food item (including
liquids other than water) and/or a food
item was removed from the child's
airway or throat. An initial data ex-
traction of the NEISS-AIP database from
2001 through 2009 was made, selecting
nonfatal cases with an unintentional in-
jury diagnosis that had a precipitating
cause indicating suffocation/inhalation
276 CHAPIN et al
and a product code involving foods (ex-
cluding hot water) or with the words
"choke" or "swallow" identified by a
keyword search of the narratives. The
narrative description for each patient's
choking event was subsequently re-
viewed by 1 of the study researchers to
identify food-related choking cases and
classify each case for type of food. Clas-
sification of all cases was then reviewed
by 3 other study researchers, and dif-
ferences in coding were resolved by
consensus. Case narratives that stated
difficulty breathing, foreign body sensa-
tion, stuck in throat, or throat pain were
retained. Cases in which the narrative
indicated smoke inhalation, submer-
sion, strangulation, a breath-holding
spell, exposure to noxious or toxic sub-
stances, or poisoning were excluded.
Cases were also excluded if the child
choked on an unknown or nonfood item
(including vomitus), if food was found
in the esophagus or ingested without
mention of a foreign body sensation or
choking, or if the only symptom was
difficulty swallowing.
Variables
For analysis, NEISS-AIP variables were
collapsed into broader categories to
increase statistical stability of national
estimates. Consistent with previous
research on choking on food in the
pediatric population, age was divided
into 3 groups: 0 to 4 years, 5 to 9 years,
and 10 to 14 years.1 In addition, single
year of age for those aged 1 to 14 years
and month of age for children aged ,1
year were used to calculate mean ages.
Disposition at ED discharge was col-
lapsed into 3 categories: treated and
released, hospitalized (including those
transferred to another hospital or held
for observation), and left against medi-
cal advice. Event location was described
as home, school (including day care
settings), and other. Case narratives
were used to generate a variable for
type of food. Type of food was classified
into 17 different categories: hard candy,
other candy (eg, gum, soft candy), meat
(other than hot dogs), hot dogs, bone,
fruits/vegetables, formula (including
milk and breast milk), seeds/nuts/shells,
chips/pretzels/popcorn, biscuits/cookies/
crackers, bread/pastries, french fries,
noodles/pasta, multiple specified foods,
other foods, other/unspecified liquids,
and unknown.
Statistical Analysis
Study results were based on weighted
data for 2953 nonfatal choking-related
NEISS-AIP cases. Statistical analyses
were performed by using SAS version
9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) and
SUDAANrelease10.0(ResearchTriangle
Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC)
software. Sample weights for NEISS-AIP
cases were used to calculate national
food-related choking incidence esti-
mates and risk ratios (RRs) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs).16 Data re-
ported in this study are national esti-
mates unless otherwise specified.
Missing values were not included in
our analyses. Rates per 100 000 per-
sons were calculated by using 2001
through 2009 national population esti-
mates acquired from the US Census
Bureau.17
RESULTS
An estimated 111 914 (95% CI: 83 975­
139 854) children ages 0 to 14 years
presented to US hospital EDs from 2001
through 2009 for episodes of nonfatal
food-related choking, with an average
of 12 435 children per year (34 children
per day). The overall rate of food-
related choking during the study
period was 20.4 (95% CI: 15.4­25.3)
episodes per 100 000 population. No
significant linear trend for the number
of choking episodes was found during
the 9-year study period. Event location
was identified for 73 247 cases (65.4%),
and the majority of these occurred at
home (89.8%, 65 785 cases [95% CI: 46
988­84 581]), followed by school (3.3%,
2384 cases [95% CI: 1416­3352]). Most
patients with food-related choking
were treated and released from the
ED (87.3%, 97 509 cases [95% CI: 72
395­122 623]), whereas 10.0% (11 218
cases [95% CI: 7614­14 822]) were
hospitalized and 2.6% (2911 cases
[95% CI: 1455­4366]) left against medical
advice.
Patient Age
The mean 6 SE patient age in this study
was 4.5 6 0.2 years. Patients aged #1
year accounted for 37.8% (42 296 cases
[95% CI: 30 832­53 760]) of all food-
related choking episodes. The esti-
mated number of choking episodes
decreased with increasing age until
age 7 years, after which the esti-
mated number remained relatively
unchanged through age 14 years
(Fig 1). There were 69 087 (95% CI:
51 946­86 229) food-related choking
episodes among children ages 0 to 4
years, 24 263 (95% CI: 16 384­32 141)
episodes among children ages 5 to 9
years, and 18 564 (95% CI: 13 467­23 660)
episodes among children ages 10 to 14
years. Patients 0 to 4 years of age
experienced the highest rate of chok-
ing during the study period (37.6 [95%
CI: 28.5­46.7]) episodes per 100 000
population), followed by children ages
5 to 9 years (13.5 [95% CI: 9.2­17.8]
episodes per 100 000 population) and
children ages 10­14 years (10.0
[95% CI: 7.3­12.7] episodes per 100 000
population).
Patient Gender
Male patients accounted for 55.4%
(61 942cases[95%CI:46 411­77 474])of
all food-related choking episodes. Al-
though not statistically significant, the
percentage of female patients treated
for food-related choking episodes was
higher than that of male patients at
several single age levels (ie, ,1 year,
5 years, and 10 years) (Fig 1). The rate
ARTICLE
PEDIATRICS Volume 132, Number 2, August 2013 277
of food-related choking episodes for
male subjects during the study period
was 22.0 (95% CI: 16.6­27.4) episodes
per 100 000 population and for female
subjects, it was 18.6 (95% CI: 13.9­23.3)
episodes per 100 000 population.
Food Type
The types of food that contributed to
choking episodes among children in
this study are shown in Table 1. Of all
known food types, hard candy caused
the most choking episodes (15.5%),
followed by other candy (12.8%), meat
(other than hot dogs) (12.2%), and
bone (12.0%). These 4 food types alone
accounted for more than one-half
(52.5%) of choking episodes with
a known food type. The mean age of
those treated for food-related choking
varied according to food type. Children
with bone-induced choking episodes
had a mean age of 7.6 years, whereas
those with formula/milk/breast milk­
induced choking episodes had a mean
age of 0.3 year (ie, 4 months). Although
formula/milk/breast milk was re-
sponsible for 6.7% of all food-related
choking, it accounted for more than
one-third (36.3%) of the choking epi-
sodes among children aged ,1 year.
Hot dogs accounted for 2.6% of food-
related choking (Table 1). Patients
who choked on a hot dog were more
likely to require hospitalization than
those who choked on another type of
food (RR = 2.23 [95% CI: 1.20­4.15]). In
addition, patients who choked on a
seed/nut/shell were more likely to re-
quire hospitalization than those who
choked on another food type (RR = 2.58
[95% CI: 1.56­4.25]).
The distribution of the most common
food types involved in choking episodes
among patients ages 0 to 4 years, by
year of age, is displayed in Table 2. The
number of choking episodes involving
candy (both hard and other candy
combined) increased with increasing
age. By age 4 years, 55.2% of choking
episodes involved candy. In addition,
patients 0 to 4 years of age were more
likely to choke on fruits/vegetables than
patients aged 5 to 14 years (RR = 1.94
[95% CI: 1.41­2.68]).
DISCUSSION
This study estimated that .12 000
nonfatal choking-related injuries at-
tributable to food occurred annually
from 2001 through 2009. This estimate
is higher than that previously reported
(10 438) by the CDC in astudy ofnonfatal
choking-related injuries in 2001.1 In the
current study, male subjects accounted
for a higher number of nonfatal food-
related choking episodes than female
subjects. This higher frequency among
males is similar to that observed
in previous studies, including both
fatal and nonfatal food-related chok-
ing episodes.1,2,14,18
The mean age for choking on foods
in this study was 4.5 years. Previous
investigations that included both food
and nonfood items have typically re-
ported a younger mean age; the most
hazardous age range for choking-
related injuries is reportedly younger
than3 or4years,1,4­6,11,12,15 with several
studies finding more than one-half
of patients to be aged ,2 years.1,14,18
In the current study, 62% of all non-
fatal cases occurred among children
aged ,4 years. Compared with older
children, those ,4 years of age are
at greater risk of food-related choking.
Before molars erupt (age #2 years),
children are able to bite off a piece
of food with their incisors but lack the
ability to grind it adequately. By 3 to 4
years of age, children have developed
molars but are still learning to chew
and swallow effectively. Children in this
age range also may be easily dis-
tracted and not focused on the task
of eating. In addition, behavioral fac-
tors, such as high activity levels while
eating, as well as developmental dis-
abilities and neurologic conditions may
increase choking risk among young
children.4,6
Similar to the study by the CDC in
2001,1 the current study found that
candy was the top contributor to
nonfatal food-related choking epi-
sodes. In addition to candy, our study
also identified meat, bone, and fruits/
vegetables as common causes of non-
fatal food-related choking episodes
among children. Previous studies
have identified hot dogs, seeds, nuts,
candy, and raw fruits/vegetables as the
most common foods associated with
fatal choking episodes.2­7,14 Seeds/nuts/
shells and hot dogs were the seventh
and 12th, respectively, most commonly
noted foods in our study of nonfatal

episodes. These differences in asso-
ciated foods between fatal and nonfatal
choking episodes may be due in part
to the physical characteristics of
certain foods. Hot dogs, for example,
are cylindrical in shape, similar in
diameter to a child's airway, and com-
pressible, allowing them to com-
pletely block a child's hypopharynx
and resulting in an increased risk of
fatal injury. Some high-risk foods are
more difficult to chew (eg, raw fruits
and vegetables) or are frequently
consumed by the mouthful (eg, seeds,
nuts, some candies), which may over-
whelma child's chewingandswallowing
abilities, resulting in aspiration of food
fragments.6
Although the CPSC has well-established
surveillance systems in place, as well
aslegislationandregulationstoprotect
children from nonfood-related choking,
no similar monitoring systems, legis-
lation, or regulations currently exist
to address food-related choking among
children. The American Academy of
Pediatrics (AAP) has proposed mea-
sures to prevent pediatric food-related
choking.4 These recommendations in-
clude instituting a mandatory system
to label high-risk foods with appropri-
ate information regarding their choking
risk to children, detailed surveillance
of food-related choking incidents, and
public awareness campaigns to educate
the public about food-related choking
hazards. The AAP recommends that the
US Food and Drug Administration take
the lead on these measures, while
working closely with the US Depart-
ment of Agriculture (which has regula-
tory jurisdiction over meat products)
and the CPSC. In addition, more detail
in the medical records collected in EDs
about the type of foods involved and
circumstances surrounding choking
episodes would help document the
problem and provide data relevant
to developing interventions aimed at pre-
venting food choking among children. In

important role in prevention by using
population-based food choking data,
such as those of the NEISS-AIP, to support
efforts to better protect the public
through changes in the design and
manufacturing of food products con-
sumed by children, with the goal
of reducing the likelihood of pediatric
choking.
Advice for Child Caregivers
Information from the current study
can alert medical and public health
professionals and others about the
potential dangers of choking on foods
and, specifically, which foods pose
the greatest risks to children. Child
caregivers should also be aware of
food choking prevention recommen-
dationsandageguidelinesprovidedby
professional organizations, such as
the AAP. For example, the AAP recom-
mends that children ,5 years of age
not be given hard candies or gum
and that raw fruits and vegetables be
cut into small pieces.4 The current
study provides evidence supporting
these recommendations. In addition,
the AAP recommends that young
children should be supervised while
eating, should eat sitting down, and
should never run, walk, play, or
lie down with food in their mouth.4
If a choking incident does occur,
caretakers can be prepared by being
familiar with and practicing choking-
related rescue maneuvers.
Study Limitations
As with all studies using prerecorded
data, the current study had some
limitations. First, we were unable to
document all cases of choking on food,
for a number of reasons. For example,
choking episodes that resolved at
home or were treated in a medical
facility other than an ED were not in-
cluded in this study. In addition, it
was sometimes difficult to discern
what caused the choking event, which
potentially excluded some true
food-related choking cases. The cases
reported in the current study thus may
not be representative of all cases
of food-related choking. Second, the
short narratives provided by the
NEISS-AIP were unable to provide
enough information for several addi-
tional variables we attempted to code,
including adult presence during the
choking event, concurrent activities of
the child when the choking occurred,
howthechildobtainedthefood,amount
of time between the choking event and
the child presenting to the ED, whether
the food was prepared in a manner
thought to reduce the likelihood of
choking,theuseandsuccessofchoking
rescue maneuvers, and the perfor-
mance of any diagnostic or therapeutic
medical procedures.
CONCLUSIONS
This is the first multiyear, nationally
representative study on nonfatal
food choking among children. The
current study found that .12 000
nonfatal choking-related injuries
attributable to food occur each
year. Improved surveillance, food la-
beling and redesign, and public edu-
cation are strategies that can help
reduce pediatric food choking.
