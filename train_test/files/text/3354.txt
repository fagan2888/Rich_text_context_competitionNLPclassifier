AND ITS TOXICITY

 Metallothioneins (MTs) are a group of intracellular metal-binding and cysteine-enriched pro-
teins and are highly inducible in many tissues in response to various types of stress. Although it
mainly acts as a regulator of metal homeostasis such as zinc and copper in tissues, MT also acts as a
potent antioxidant and adaptive (or stress) protein to protect cells and tissues from oxidative stress.
Diabetes affects many Americans and other populations, and its development and toxic effect on
various organs have been attributed to increased oxidative stress. Studies showed that zinc-induced or
genetically enhanced pancreatic MT synthesis prevented diabetes induced by chemicals such as strep-
tozotocin and alloxan, and zinc pretreatment also prevented spontaneously developed diabetes. Since
diabetic complications are the consequences of organ damage caused by diabetic hyperglycemia and
hyperlipidemia through oxidative stress, whether MT in nonpancreatic organs also provides a pre-
ventive effect on diabetic toxicity has been recently investigated. We demonstrated that overexpression
of cardiac MT significantly prevented diabetes-induced cardiomyopathy. Likewise, overexpression of
renal MT also prevented diabetes-induced renal toxicity. In addition, we also found that MT as an
adaptive protein is overexpressed in several organs in response to diabetes. Therefore, the biological
importance of diabetes-induced MT in diabetic complications and subsequent other pathogenesis was
further explored. We found that diabetes-induced hepatic and renal MT synthesis was accompanied
by a significant prevention of endotoxin-induced hepatic toxicity and cisplatin-induced renal toxi-
city. These studies suggest that MT as an adaptive protein can prevent both diabetes development
and its complications or subsequent suffered other pathogenic injury.

INTRODUCTION
Metallothioneins (MTs) are a group of intracellular metal-binding and
cysteine-enriched proteins. Four isoforms of MTs are characterized, and MT-I
and MT-II exist as the major isoforms in various human and animal organ
tissues including pancreas (Thornalley and Vasak, 1985; Klaassen and Liu,
1998; Cai et al., 1999; Kang, 1999). Zinc (Zn) is the major metal to which
MT binds under physiological conditions, but is can be replaced by other

metals such as copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), and iron (Fe). Functionally,
MT mainly acts as a regulator of metal homeostasi in tissues, especially trace
element metals, and also acts as a potent antioxidant to protect cells or tis-
sues from oxidative damage (Klaassen and Liu, 1998; Cai et al., 1999; Kang,
1999). Compared with other antioxidants that can protect specifically against
certain damage--SOD against superoxide radical, catalase against hydrogen
peroxide, and glutathione peroxidase against hydrogen peroxide and lipid
peroxides--MT is a potent antioxidant against a wide range of free radi-
cals including the most active radicals: hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite
(Thornalley and Vasak, 1985; Miura et al., 1997; Cai et al., 1999, 2000a; Cai
and Cherian, 2003).
Diabetes affects so many Americans and other populations around the
world. Cardiovascular injury from diabetes contributes greatly to various di-
abetic complications including renal, retinal, and cardiac dysfunction and
even stroke (Cai and Kang, 2001a; Rosen et al., 2001). In addition, both di-
abetes onset and its complications have been considered to be due to the
generation of oxidative stress caused by diabetes; therefore, developing a
strategy for prevention of diabetic onset and its complications through sup-
pression of oxidative stress has received investigative attention (Cai and Kang,
2001a; Rosen et al., 2001). A pilot study by Dr. Cherian has demonstrated
that Zn-induced MT synthesis in rat pancreas prevented chemical streptozo-
tocin (STZ)-induced diabetes (Yang and Cherian, 1994), and we have shown
that overexpressed MT in the mouse heart significantly prevented diabetes-
induced cardiomyopathy (Cai and Kang, 2001b; Kang and Cai, 2001). These
preliminary studies have been further confirmed and characterized by later
studies. In this article, the summarized data based on our own and other stud-
ies for the prevention of diabetes onset, its complications, and subsequent
suffered pathogenic injury were presented to extend our insight into MT
prevention of diabetes and its toxicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Early published data on the preventive effect of MT on diabetes onset and
diabetic complications were obtained by searching MEDLINE using MT and
diabetes and selected after studying the content of these publications. Our
own studies were performed in a mouse diabetic model which was produced
by giving a single injection of 150 mg/kg STZ as described by Cai et al. (2002a).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
MT Prevents Diabetes
In the study by Yang and Cherian (1994), diabetes was produced by a
single injection of STZ (75 mg/kg) in Sprague Dawley rats, and the synthesis

In addition, (C) serum MT and (D) glucose levels were also measured on days 1, 21, and 45 after STZ

of pancreatic MT was induced by subcutaneous Zn injection 12 hr before
injection of STZ. Results, summarized in Figure 1, indicate that both Zn
and MT levels increased in the pancreas of rats on day 1 after STZ treat-
ment. Serum MT was also significantly increased in the Zn + STZ group on
days 1, 21, and 45 after STZ treatment. More importantly, serum glucose
levels in both STZ and Zn + STZ groups increased compared with the con-
trol group, but the level of glucose in the Zn + STZ group was significantly
lower than that in the STZ group (Figure 1D). This result suggests that MT
induction by Zn pretreatment could significantly prevent STZ-induced dia-
betes. Subsequent experiments supporting the case for prevention against
diabetes development by MT are summarized in Table 1 with the following
characteristics.

MT synthesis for prevention of the diabetic development. Supplementation

of Zn by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection, drinking water and
dietary food were all effective in inducing pancreatic MT, which was con-
firmed by measuring MT protein level using biochemical assay (such as Cd-
hem), Western blotting or immunohistochemical localization, and mRNA
level using the RT-PCR method. By in situ immunohistochemical methods,
MT induction has been specifically identified in islet -cells. Cu is another
well-known MT inducer (Thornalley and Vasak, 1985; Klaassen and Liu, 1998;
Cai et al., 1999; Kang, 1999). Like Zn, supplementation of Cu also provided
significant prevention of diabetes induced by multiple low doses of STZ
(Sitasawad et al., 2001). In addition, a transgenic mouse model was devel-
oped in which MT is pancreatic-specifically expressed about 20-fold higher
than the wild type without alteration of other antioxidants, and a signifi-
cantly high resistance to STZ-induced diabetic development was observed in
this mouse model (Chen et al., 2001), suggesting the direct prevention by
MT of STZ-induced diabetes.
Induced MT synthesis prevents diabetes development in a wide range of
diabetic models. It has been recently reported that multiple low doses of STZ
induce a diabetic model mechanistically different from that induced by a sin-
gle high dose of STZ ( Ohly et al., 2000; Ho et al., 2001; Sitasawad et al., 2001).
Induced MT synthesis in pancreas not only prevented diabetes induced by
a single dose of STZ or alloxan, but it also prevented diabetes induced by
multiple low doses of STZ, and even genetically prodiabetic models such as
Metallothionein and Diabetes 93
the BB Wister rat and db/db or od/od mouse diabetes development. This
suggests that MT can prevent both type I and type II diabetes.
The preventive effect of T on diabetes could be seen in different strains of
rats and mice. The preventive effect of induced MT synthesis in pancreas was
not affected by species difference for the diabetic development in response to
STZ. For example, C57BL/6 mice typically start severe hyperglycemia 2 weeks
after the first injection of STZ, whereas B6SJL/F1 mice show a long latent
period for developing severe hyperglycemia about 10 weeks after the first
injection of STZ (Ohly et al., 2000). However, the preventive effect of induced
MT synthesis in pancreas was significantly observed in both diabetic models.
MT Prevents Diabetic Complications
Increasing evidence in both experimental and clinical studies suggests
that free radicals are formed disproportionately in diabetes by glucose ox-
idation, nonenzymatic glycation of proteins, and the subsequent oxidative
degradation of glycated proteins. These consequences of oxidative stress play
a major role in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications (Cai and Kang,
2001a; Rosen et al., 2001). We recently have demonstrated that high levels
of glucose induce cardiac cell death along with significant ROS formation
(Cai et al., 2002a). In diabetic rats, abnormal spermatogenesis was found
due to germ cell death (Cai et al., 2000b). Therefore, we hypothesized that
diabetes-caused oxidative stress may play a critical role in inducing cell death
in diabetes-targeted organs leading to severe organ dysfunction, and MT as a
potent antioxidant may prevent diabetic complications through suppression
of diabetic oxidative damage.
First we have preliminarily explored the preventive effect of MT in the
heart on diabetes-induced cardiac toxicity (Cai and Kang, 2001b; Kang and
Cai, 2001). We found that diabetes-caused cardiac toxicity, measured by
serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and cardiac cell death, could be pre-
vented in cardiac-specific MT-overexpressing transgenic mice (Cai and Kang,
2001b; Kang and Cai, 2001). Table 2 summarizes the features obtained from
subsequent studies on the preventive role of MT in diabetes-induced car-
diac toxicities. These studies suggested that MT in the hearts showed sig-
nificant prevention against diabetes-induced serum cardiac enzyme activity,
myocardial cell death, oxidative damage, and abnormal morphology and
function.
A different transgenic mouse model in which MT is whole-body over-
expressed was also used to investigate the protective effect of MT on dia-
betic toxicity. MT expression in the heart and kidney of transgenic (MT-TG)
mice was significantly higher than that of their wild-type (WT) counterparts
(Figure 2A, Cai et al., unpublished data). Our preliminary study (Cai et al.,
unpublished data) showed that diabetes was developed by administration of
a single dose of STZ (150 mg/kg) in both MT-TG and WT mice. Impaired

cardiac and renal function were observed in the WT (C57BL/6) diabetic
mice, showing increases in cardiac enzyme activity (CPK) and BUN or cre-
atinine levels, but these changes were not observed in the MT-TG diabetic
mice (Figures 2B and 2C). These studies, therefore, strongly indicate that
MT as a potent antioxidant significantly prevents the diabetes-induced car-
diac and renal toxicities, respectively, and results in a prevention of these
organ dysfunctions.
MT Induced by Diabetes Prevents Subsequent Pathogenic Injury
MT is also up-regulated in various organs in response to various types
of stress, making it a so-called adaptive response (stress) protein (Klaassen
and Liu, 1998; Cai et al., 1999). In our previous study, we demonstrated that
MT expression was significantly enhanced in the liver and kidney of 1- and
6-month diabetic rats (Cai et al., 2002b) and in organs of 2-month diabetic
mice (Figure 3). However, what biological importance diabetes-induced MT
plays in diabetes and other coexisting pathogenesis has received limited in-
vestigative attention.
We recently investigated the effect of diabetes on endotoxin-induced hep-
atic toxicity by measuring serum hepatic enzymes in normal and 2-month
diabetic mice after endotoxin treatment. We found that 2-month diabetes an-
imals exhibited a significant increase in hepatic MT expression compared to
nondiabetic mice (Figure 3), and endotoxin further enhances the diabetes-
induced MT expression (Song et al., unpublished data). More important,
diabetic animals exhibited significantly reduced endotoxin-induced hepatic
injury, showing significantly lower serum ALT activity and hepatic lipid per-
oxidation (TBARS) than one would expect from LPS-treated diabetic mice
(Figure 4).
In support of this observation, an early study demonstrated that renal MT
synthesis was increased in diabetic mice and was accompanied by a significant

Adult (8­10-week-old) male transgenic mice in which MT-I/II genes are overexpressed in whole-body
and their wild-type (C57BL/6J) mice were used to measure cardiac and renal MT by Cd-hem methods

an index of renal function were measured in WT and MT-TG diabetic mice 1 month after STZ-treatment.

prevention of cisplatin-induced renal dysfunction (Jin et al., 1996). In addi-
tion, earlier studies have shown the preventive effects of diabetes on subse-
quent ischemia-induced cardiac injuries (Bouchard and Lamontagne, 1998;
Tatsumi et al., 1998; Ravingerova et al., 2000; Schaffer et al., 2000). This may
also be related to the induction of cardiac MT in response to diabetes as
indicated in Figure 3. In summary, these results indicated that diabetes at
certain stages of its pathogenesis can provide a resistance to subsequent insult-
induced toxicity, and this enhanced resistance may be due to up-regulated
MT expression.

Mechanisms by Which MT Prevents Diabetes, Diabetic Complications,
and Subsequent Other Pathogenic Injury
MT as Antioxidant
Oxidative stress is the critical initiator for diabetic onset and complica-
tions, and antioxidants can prevent both diabetic onset and complications
(Rosen et al., 2001). T-cell­mediated inflammatory autoimmune reaction and
STZ- or alloxan-induced diabetes are all considered to be due to ROS and
RNS formation leading to -cell destruction. In addition, very low concentra-
tions of antioxidants found in animal pancreatic islets and hearts make these
organs vulnerable to STZ or alloxan-induced diabetes through the genera-
tion of ROS and RNS (Lenzen et al., 1996; Tiedge et al., 1997).
Pancreas contains relatively high levels of MT compared to other tissues
such as liver and heart (Onosaka et al., 1988; Andrews et al., 1990; Tomita
and Matsubara, 2000). The high expression of MT in pancreas may suggest
that it is required for normal physiological function. Indeed, mice with the
MT-I and -II gene null show obesity and hyperlipidemia (Beattie et al., 1998).
Furthermore, although isolated islets from MT-null and WT mice had similar
insulin content (168 ng insulin/five islets for WT mice vs 170 ± 16 ng/five
islets for MT-null mice), the islets from the MT-null mice showed much lower
levels of basal and maximal insulin releisletsase (Laychock et al., 2000). These
results suggest the requirement of MT for physiological function of pancre-
atic -cells in which MT may act as an antioxidant in scavenging ROS and RNS
to preserve cell membrane integrity, protein sulfhydryls or nucleic acids, and
secretary responsiveness. Overexpression of MT induced by Zn in pancreatic
-cells has been shown to provide significant protection against STZ-induced
diabetes in rats and mice (Table 1), suggesting that MT plays an important
role in the prevention of oxidative injury which otherwise initiates diabetes.
The possibility that the prevention of the diabetes was due to other effects
of the inducer (such as Zn) was eliminated by use of genetically manip-
ulated pancreatic-specific MT-overexpressing transgenic mice (Chen et al.,
2001). In these mice, both spontaneously developed and STZ-induced dia-
betes were prevented. In cultured islets from control mice and MT-TG mice,
MT decreases STZ-induced islet disruption, DNA breakage, and depletion
of NAD+. These results demonstrate that MT can reduce diabetes through
inhibition of STZ-induced oxidative DNA damage (Chen et al., 2001). Using
cardiac MT-TG mice, significant prevention of diabetic cardiomyopathy was
also found along with significant suppression of diabetes-induced ROS and
RNS accumulation and oxidative damage (Table 2).
Activation of NF-B (a ROS-sensitive transcription factor) plays a criti-
cal role in initiating -cell death leading to diabetic development (Darville
et al., 2001; Heimberg et al., 2001; Ho et al., 2001). MT plays a role in the
negative regulation of NF-B (Sakurai et al., 1999; Papouli et al., 2002), and
dietary Zn supplementation with overexpressing pancreatic MT was found to

significantly attenuate hyperglycemia in prodiabetes db/db mice and chem-
ically induced diabetes by alloxan or STZ, accompanied by significant inhi-
bition of NF-B activation (Ho et al., 2001; Simon and Taylor, 2001).
In further support of the antioxidant action of MT, there is evidence
indicating that up-regulation of SOD made mice resistant to diabetes de-
velopment (Kubisch et al., 1997). Thioredoxin (TRX), a redox (reduction/
oxidation)-active protein, has recently been shown to protect cells from ox-
idative stress. Transgenic mice with specific expression of TRX in pancreatic
islets showed a significantly lower incidence of spontaneously developed and
STZ-induced diabetes as compared to their WT counterparts (Hotta et al.,
1998). In addition, low-dose radiation has been known to up-regulate an-
tioxidant capacity leading to a wide range of adaptive response (Cai, 1999).
It has also been reported that low-dose radiation prevents spontaneous or
chemically induced development of diabetes through enhanced pancreatic
antioxidant capacity (Takehara et al., 1995; Takahashi et al., 2000).
MT as Regulator of Zn Homeostasis
MT is a regulator of Zn homeostasis. When the target tissues are ex-
posed to oxidative stress, Zn-binding MT releases Zn that in turn plays an
important role in the prevention of oxidative damage (Maret, 2000). High
Zn content was found in islets. For example, Zn content of Sprague Dawley
rat pancreatic islets was found to be 27.9 ± 2.0 ng/mg islet cells (Kim et al.,
2000). This may suggest the requirement of Zn for insulin function (Kim
et al., 2000; Lukowiak et al., 2001; Tang and Shay, 2001). Several physiological
roles of Zn in insulin function have been recently indicated (Salgueiro et al.,
2001): (a) Zn is required for insulin-forming hexameric crystals which are
stored in -cells and released into the portal venous system at the time of
-cell degranulation. Furthermore, pancreatic Zn level in db/db mice was
significantly lower than in lean mice, and Zn supplementation restored both
pancreatic Zn concentration and serum glucose of db/db mice (Simon and
Taylor, 2001). (b) The Zn-to-insulin ratio within these crystals determines the
ternary structure, antigenic properties of insulin, and the binding capacity to
its receptor. (c) Zn pretreatment not only accelerates and increases the mag-
nitude of insulin binding to the receptor, but also simultaneously inhibits the
degradation of insulin by the liver plasma membranes. (d) Zn is closely in-
volved in insulin-dependent metabolism of protein, carbohydrate, and lipids,
and chelation of Zn is able to induce diabetes (Epand et al., 1985). (e) Zn is an
important factor in preventing cell death. Zn can inhibit caspase-3 activation
to prevent cell death that is initiated via Fas/FasL pathway or mitochondrial
cytochrome c pathway (Yamada et al., 1999). -cell death under exposure to
different insults plays a critical role in the development of diabetes (Chandra
et al., 2001). Therefore, Zn plays important and wide-ranging functions in
regulation of insulin function and prevention of spontaneous and chemical-
induced diabetes.
Metallothionein and Diabetes 99
However, whether these functions of Zn are MT-dependent is unclear
because MT is both normally found in high concentration in pancreas and
also highly inducible by Zn. MT-null mice were used to investigate the effect
of Zn supplement against STZ-induced diabetes in order to dissect the pro-
tective role against STZ-induced diabetes either by MT or Zn (Apostolova
et al., 1997), but the results are still inconclusive. In that experiment, Zn
pretreatment was given at two dose levels: 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg body
weight as ZnSO4. The high dose of Zn fully suppressed development of
hyperglycemia in both MT-null and WT mice after STZ treatment. How-
ever, the low-dose Zn pretreatment had a definite inhibitory effect on STZ-
induced diabetes development in MT-null mice, but no marked effect in
WT control. This study seems to suggest that Zn itself can play an impor-
tant role in the prevention of diabetic pathogenesis under certain conditions
(Apostolova et al., 1997). However, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in
MT-null mice is less than in WT mice, suggesting the requirement of pancre-
atic MT for the insulin secretion under normal condition (Laychock et al.,
2000).
The different effects between low-dose and high-dose levels of Zn may be
due to MT induction in nonpancreatic tissues. In C57BL/6J mice, low-dose
Zn supplement induced hepatic and renal MT, which binds more Zn lead-
ing to less free Zn available to pancreas -cells, whereas in MT-null mice the
lack of MT induction, or subsequent Zn binding, in nonpancreatic tissues
causes sufficient free Zn to be available for pancreatic -cells. It has been
documented that MT induction by low-dose Zn supplementation is lower
in the pancreas than in the liver, whereas high concentration of Zn sup-
plementation could induce a higher proportion of pancreatic MT synthesis
compared to liver (Zimny et al., 1993). This study suggests that liver is the
target organ for initial storage of Zn although pancreas is highly responsible
for Zn-induced MT synthesis. This explanation may also explain the failure
of MT to demonstrate protection in the alloxan-induced diabetes study by
Minami et al. (1999).
The aforementioned studies strongly demonstrate that MT prevents di-
abetes through its antioxidant action, Zn regulation, or both. Enhanced ex-
pression of MT by inducers other than Zn provides significant prevention
of diabetes. For example, cytokines (Laychock et al., 2000) and Cu (Vinci
et al., 1995; Tobia et al., 1998; Sitasawad et al., 2001) significantly prevented
diabetes in rats and mice. These results support the antioxidant action of
MT in the prevention of diabetes. In addition, although Zn is required for
insulin physiological function and provides preventive effects from sponta-
neous and chemical-induced diabetes, high levels of free Zn also cause pan-
creatic -cell damage resulting in diabetes (Kim et al., 2000). The fact that the
free-Zn-induced pancreatic -cell damage can be prevented by Zn chelator
(Kim et al., 2000) suggests that MT plays an important role in maintaining

and diabetic complications.
Zn homeostasis by binding free Zn and releasing Zn when it is required.
Therefore, MT plays the critical role in coordination with Zn for preventing
diabetes development, as outlined in Figure 5.
Regarding the relationship between MT and Zn in nonpancreatic tissues
and their function in preventing diabetic complications, to date no inves-
tigation has been documented. With the exception of Zn's role in insulin
regulation and secretion, it would be expected that the relationship interac-
tion between Zn and MT would be the same as in the pancreas (Figure 5).
In summary, MT as a potent antioxidant, adaptive protein, and Zn home-
ostasis regulator plays important roles in the prevention of diabetes develop-
ment, complications, and subsequent suffered pathogenic toxicity. Develop-
ment of strategies for up-regulation of MT would be of interest for pharma-
ceutical and medical applications.
