Abstract
KANT, ASHIMA K. Association of self-perceived body
weight status with dietary reporting by U.S. teens. Obes
Res. 2002;10:1259­1269.
Objective: Children's self perception of body weight and
the medical definition of obesity show poor correlation.
This study examined the independent associations of
body mass index (BMI) and self-perceived weight status
(considered self over-, under-, or right weight) with food
reporting, nutrient intake estimates, and biomarkers of
dietary exposure.
Research Methods and Procedures: Dietary (one 24-hour
recall), anthropometric, and biochemical data were from the
third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(1269 boys and 1385 girls, ages 12 to 18 years). Sex-
specific multiple regression analyses were used to deter-
mine the association of BMI and self-perceived body weight
status with reported intakes of energy, macronutrients, low-
nutrient-dense foods, micronutrients, and serum concentra-
tions of selected vitamins and carotenoids.
Results: Reported intakes of energy, macronutrients, num-
ber of eating occasions, percentage of energy from low-
nutrient-dense foods, likelihood of meeting the standard of
intake of micronutrients, and biomarkers were not different
among boys and girls who perceived themselves as over-
weight relative to those who perceived themselves at the
right weight (p  0.05). In boys, BMI was a negative
predictor of percentage of energy from low-nutrient-dense
foods (p  0.004) and intake of ascorbic acid (p  0.04).
BMI was inversely related to serum concentrations of most
carotenoids (p  0.002).
Discussion: Perceiving oneself as overweight was not as-
sociated with reporting of low-nutrient-dense foods, macro-
nutrients, micronutrients, and biomarker status; BMI, how-
ever, was a significant predictor of several outcomes.
Key words: self-perceived body weight, body mass in-
dex, weight dissatisfaction, biomarkers, adolescents
Introduction
In the third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III), in 12- to 16-year-olds, over 50% of
girls and 25% of boys who considered themselves over-
weight had an age- and height-adjusted body mass index
(BMI) of 85th percentile (1). These findings corroborate
previous reports, some dating back to the 1960s, of widely
prevalent dissatisfaction with body weight and body image
among adolescents (2­17). Perceiving oneself as over-
weight has been shown to be negatively related with body
satisfaction and self-esteem in adolescents (10), and is
strongly associated with attempts to change weight and
dieting behaviors (3,5,8,9,11,12,14­17). In view of these
observations, it was hypothesized that dietary reporting by
adolescents may differ by self-perceived body-weight sta-
tus, and the associated nutritional risk, if any, would be
reflected in biochemical markers of nutritional status. How-
ever, relatively little has been published on this topic. Most
reports to date have provided information on the prevalence
of weight or body-size dissatisfaction among adolescents
(1­17), reported weight-loss practices in association with
self-perceived body weight (3,5,8,9,11,12,14­17), or food
group/nutrient intake in relation to dieting or attempts to
lose/control body weight (10,15,16,18,19).
The objective of this study was to examine the associa-
tion of self-perceived body-weight status with reporting of
foods and nutrients in a nationally representative sample of
U.S. adolescents. Because of the likelihood of dietary mis-
reporting in this population (20), serum concentrations of
selected vitamins and carotenoids were also examined as
objective indicators of dietary exposure.

Research Methods and Procedures
This study used data from NHANES III. NHANES III
was a multistage, stratified, probability sample of the non-
institutionalized civilian U.S. population, ages 2 months and
over (21). The survey was conducted by the National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS) and included administration of
a questionnaire at home and a full medical exam along with
a battery of tests in a special mobile examination center
(MEC) (21). Demographic and medical history information
was obtained during the household interview. The MEC
exam included a physical and dental exam, dietary inter-
view, body measurements, and collection of blood and urine
samples. Body weight, height, and circumference at various
body sites were measured using standardized procedures in
the MEC (21). Response to the question--"Do you consider
yourself over-, under-, or the right weight?"--provided in-
formation on self-perceived body-weight status.
Dietary Assessment Method
A 24-hour dietary recall was collected by a trained di-
etary interviewer in a MEC interview using an automated,
microcomputer-based interview and coding system (21).
The type and amount of foods consumed were recalled
using recall aids such as abstract food models, special
charts, measuring cups, and rulers to help in quantifying the
amounts consumed. Special probes were used to help the
recall of commonly forgotten items such as condiments,
accompaniments, fast foods, alcoholic beverages, etc.
Analytic Sample
All NHANES III respondents ages 12 to 18 years with a
24-hour recall considered complete and reliable by the
NCHS were eligible for inclusion in this study (n  2765).
Respondents who were pregnant (n  34), nursing (n  3),
or missing information on self-perceived body weight (n 
74) were excluded; the final sample size was 2654 (1269
boys and 1385 girls).
Assessment of Intake of Low-Nutrient-Dense Foods
To determine the intake of low-nutrient-dense foods, it
was necessary to identify foods belonging in this category
from those reported in the 24-hour dietary recall. As a first
step, the 2578 foods reported by the analytic sample were
classified as belonging to one or more of the five major food
groups (dairy, fruit, grain, meat/alternate, and vegetable) or
the low-nutrient-dense food group using methods we have
described previously (22­24). Briefly, the assignment of
foods into the various groups was dependent on their nutri-
ent content and uses in the diet. The dairy group included
milk, yogurt, cheese, and buttermilk, but excluded butter,
cream cheese, and dairy desserts. The fruit group included
all fresh, frozen, dried, and canned fruits and fruit juices, but
excluded fruit drinks. The grain group included all breads,
cereals, pastas, and rice, but excluded pastries. The meat
group included meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and meat alternates
such as dried beans, nuts, and seeds. The vegetable group
included all raw or cooked fresh, frozen, and canned vege-
tables and juices. Mixed dishes containing foods from sev-
eral groups were grouped into all the relevant groups. Foods
excluded from these major food groups were grouped into
the low-nutrient-dense foods group. The low-nutrient-dense
foods were further placed into five subgroups as follows: 1)
visible fat--butter, oil, dressings, gravies, etc., 2) sweeten-
ers--sugar, syrup, candy, carbonated and noncarbonated
sweetened drinks, etc., 3) baked and dairy desserts--cook-
ies, cakes, pies, pastries, ice cream, puddings, cheesecakes,
etc., 4) salted snacks--potato, corn, and tortilla chips, etc.,
and 5) miscellaneous--coffee, tea, condiments, spices, etc.
The NHANES III nutrient database for individual foods,
which is derived from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
Survey Nutrient Data base, was used for estimating energy
and nutrient content of all foods (25,26). The micronutrients
examined included the following: vitamins A, E, B6
, B12
,
folate, and C, and the minerals iron, calcium, and zinc. The
intake of each nutrient was compared with the respective
age- and sex-specific standard available. The standards used
were Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for protein and all
micronutrients (27­31). For all micronutrients except cal-
cium, the estimated average requirement (EAR) was used as
the standard. For calcium, an EAR is not yet available;
therefore, the mean reported amount was examined. Be-
cause the major question of this study deals with dietary
reporting, this paper is limited to dietary nutrient intakes and
does not consider nutrients from supplements.
As an estimate of dietary misreporting, a ratio of reported
energy intake (EI) to energy expenditure for basal needs
(BEE) was computed. BEE was estimated using prediction
equations developed by the DRI committee for normal and
overweight/obese 3- to 18-year-olds (27).
Data on serum ascorbic acid, folate, and carotenoid con-
centration were obtained from the NCHS (21,32). The
methods used for measurement of these serum analytes and
their associated errors have been described (21,32). Serum
folate, ascorbic acid, and the carotenoids---carotene,
-carotene, -cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, and lyco-
pene--were chosen because the dietary intake of these
nutrients are believed to be major determinants of serum
concentration of the respective nutrient and can thus serve
as biomarkers of dietary exposure (29,30).
Statistical Analyses
The mean daily energy, percentage of energy from ma-
cronutrients and low-nutrient-dense foods, and mean per-
centage of the population meeting the DRI for selected
nutrients were obtained by categories of self-perceived
body-weight status (considered self over-, under-, or correct
weight). Because of previous reports of gender differences
in dietary patterns of adolescents, all analyses were sex-

specific. The sex-specific estimates of nutrient and food
group intake were adjusted for age (continuous), race/eth-
nicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican
American, and other), BMI (continuous), and whether an
attempt was made to lose weight in past 12 months (yes or
no). The estimate of mean serum concentration of each
analyte by categories of self-perceived body weight were
adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, dietary intake of the rele-
vant nutrient, supplement use in the 24 hours before phle-
botomy, supplement use in the past month, hours of fasting
before phlebotomy, BMI, and whether an attempt was made
to lose weight in the past 12 months (yes or no), and
smoking status (yes smoked 100 cigarettes vs. no). For
serum carotenoids, serum total cholesterol and triglycerides
were additional covariates.
The procedure used for obtaining covariate-adjusted es-
timates and SEs from survey data are based on Taylor
Linearization methods according to Graubard and Korn
(33). All statistical analyses were performed using SAS
(34), and software designed for analysis of survey data
(SUDAAN) (35). This software generates variance esti-
mates that are corrected for multistage stratified probability
design of complex surveys. Sample weights provided by the
NCHS to correct for differential probabilities of selection,
noncoverage, and nonresponse were used in all analyses to
obtain point estimates (21).
The independent association of self-perceived body
weight with food and nutrient intake was examined using
regression procedures to adjust for covariates mentioned
above. Linear regression procedures were used when the
outcome variables were continuous (e.g., dietary nutrient
intake or serum analyte concentration). For categorical out-
comes such as whether or not a nutrient intake standard was
met, logistic regression procedures were used.
Results
Table 1 presents the sociodemographic and lifestyle char-
acteristics of respondents in the three categories of self-
perceived body weight. Girls made up a higher proportion
(66%) of those who perceived themselves as overweight.
Over 90% of those who considered themselves as over-
weight wanted to weigh less, and over 65% had tried to lose
weight in the past year.
Energy and Macronutrient Intake Reporting
The mean amount of all foods, number of unique foods,
number of eating occasions, energy, ratio of EI/BEE, per-
centage of energy from macronutrients, and grams of fiber
reported by boys or girls who perceived themselves as
overweight were not significantly different from those who
perceived themselves at the right weight (Table 2). BMI was
a significant negative predictor of EI/BEE ratio in both boys
and girls. In boys, BMI related negatively with the esti-
mated percentage of energy from carbohydrate and grams of
dietary fiber, but positively with percentage of energy from
protein (Table 2). Boys responding positively to attempting
weight loss in the past 12 months reported significantly
lower mean amounts of all foods and beverages, number of
unique foods, total energy, ratio of EI/BEE, and grams of
fiber. The reported energy and macronutrient intake of girls
who had attempted weight loss in the past 12 months were
not different from those who had not attempted.
Low-Nutrient-Dense Foods Reporting
Self-perceived body-weight status and attempted weight
loss in the past year were not significant predictors of the
percentage of energy from all low-nutrient-dense foods or
subgroups (except salty snacks in girls; Table 3). In boys,
BMI was a significant negative predictor of percentage of
energy from all low-nutrient-dense foods, desserts, and salty
snacks subgroups, but a positive predictor of percentage of
energy from visible fats.
Proportion Meeting Standards for Intake of Fat,
Protein, and Selected Micronutrients on Recall Day
The mean amount of calcium intake in girls perceiving
themselves as overweight relative to those perceiving them-
selves at the right weight was lower (Table 4). Boys who
perceived themselves as overweight were more likely to
report 10% energy from saturated fat. The proportion of
boys reporting 30% energy from fat, 10% energy from
saturated fat, or the EAR for vitamin C were related in-
versely with BMI. Attempted weight loss in the past year
was a negative predictor of meeting the EAR for vitamin C,
folate, and vitamin B6
in boys and iron in girls.
Serum Vitamin and Carotenoid Concentrations
Neither self-perceived body-weight status nor attempted
weight loss in the past year were significant predictors of
serum concentrations of folate, ascorbate, and the carote-
noids (Table 5). In both boys and girls, BMI was a signif-
icant negative predictor of serum concentration of all caro-
tenoids examined (except -carotene in girls and lycopene
in boys). Dietary folate, ascorbic acid, and carotene intake
were related positively with serum concentration of the
respective nutrient.
For 17- to 18-year-olds, information on whether they
were trying to lose weight at the time of the survey was
available. In regression models for 17- to 18-year-olds in-
cluding this information, the associations presented above
remained unchanged (data not shown).

Discussion
The results of this study are remarkable for several rea-
sons. First, given the large proportion of girls who consid-
ered themselves overweight, we expected to find significant
differences in food-intake reporting among self-perceived
weight categories in girls. However, the results indicate
otherwise. Second, the expected pattern of possible inten-
tional misreporting, i.e., lower amounts of low-nutrient-
dense foods that may have been perceived as socially un-
desirable but higher amounts of nutrient-dense foods in
relation to self-perceived body weight or attempted weight
loss in the past year, were not observed in this study. No
directly comparable published reports are available for cor-
roboration because of differences in measures of weight
dissatisfaction, study design, age of subjects, and dietary
methods. However, reports of related studies present a
mixed picture. Wardle and Beale (8) reported higher body-
size dissatisfaction among 12- to 18-year-old girls relative
to boys; girls were also more likely to evaluate foods
negatively. However, differences in reported dietary intake
were not examined in this study (8). MacDonald et al. (7)
found that 14- to 18-year-old Canadian girls with poor-
quality diets were more likely to perceive themselves as
larger in body size than girls with good diets. Conversely,
extent of body-image dissatisfaction determined from pic-
torial representation of body silhouettes in 7- to 16-year-old
girls did not relate with reported energy and percentage of
energy from macronutrients (36).
Although quantitative differences in the amount of en-
ergy, macronutrients, and micronutrients reported by girls in
various self-perceived body-weight categories were not sig-
nificant, calcium was found to be an exception, suggesting
qualitative differences in the nature of foods reported. Given
that most adolescent girls are at risk for inadequate calcium
intakes, girls who perceive themselves as overweight re-
quire special attention with regard to this nutrient.
For boys, BMI was a significant predictor of several
dietary outcomes, including reporting of percentage of en-
ergy from macronutrients and low-nutrient-dense foods.
Although mean percentage of energy from fat did not relate
to BMI in boys, BMI was a positive correlate of percentage
of energy from visible/discretionary fat and a negative cor-
relate of meeting the standards of fat intake and vitamin C.
These results are contrary to the expectation of increasing
BMI being associated with reporting of lower fat intake and
higher intake of nutritionally desirable foods. Having at-
tempted weight loss in the past year also increased the risk
of not meeting the standard on recall day for ascorbic acid,
folate, and vitamin B6
intakes in boys and iron in girls.
Nutrient-intake profiles of most adults attempting to control
weight tend not to place them at risk of deficiency and may
in fact be more favorable than nondieters (19,37,38). Ado-
lescents attempting weight loss, however, do not report
better food-intake patterns and consequently may have com-
promised nutrient intake (19,37).
One strength of this study is the availability of biomark-
ers (serum folate, ascorbate, and carotenoids). Reported
dietary intake of each of these nutrients (folate, ascorbate,
and carotenoids) was found to be significantly associated
with serum concentration of the respective nutrient, thus
confirming the general validity of the reported dietary in-
take of these nutrients in NHANES III. The self-perceived
body-weight status or history of attempted weight loss did
not relate with any of the biomarkers examined. BMI,
however, was a negative correlate of serum concentration of
most carotenoids. There may be at least two possible ex-
planations for observing an association between a nondi-
etary variable (such as self-perceived body weight status,
BMI, or attempted weight loss) and serum concentration of
a nutrient after adjustment for the relevant dietary nutrient
intake. First, the nondietary variable may relate to intake
(e.g., biased vs. nonbiased reporting) or it may influence in
vivo nutrient metabolism and distribution. For example, in
boys, dietary ascorbic acid reporting was negatively related
to BMI; however, BMI was not an independent predictor of
serum ascorbic acid concentration in dietary ascorbate­
adjusted models, suggesting that BMI could provide no
additional information about serum ascorbate. However,
BMI-serum carotenoid association was significant, whereas
total dietary carotenoid intake was not related to BMI. It is
conceivable that biased reporting of carotenoid food sources
may be partially responsible for this observed association.
Others have also reported an association between BMI and
serum - and -carotene in adolescents (39) and adults
(40,41). Little has been published on possible explanations
for the BMI effect on circulating carotenoids. Putative rea-
sons may include increased use, dilution, redistribution, or
tissue sequestration of these analytes (41). Recent data on
vitamin D metabolism in association with adiposity suggest
that tissue sequestration of fat soluble analytes may partially
explain lower circulating levels (42). In this case, serum
concentrations of these sequestered nutrients should in-
crease with mobilization of fat stores associated with weight
loss. However, there are few published studies where this
hypothesis has been examined by sequential evaluation of
biomarker status in subjects trying to lose weight. Health
implications, if any, of this possible nutrient redistribution
remain unknown.
The results of this study should be interpreted with con-
sideration of the following limitations. First, the method of
dietary assessment was a single 24-hour recall. All methods
of dietary assessment, including the recall, contain measure-
ment errors, thus limiting its usefulness for determining the
usual dietary intake of individuals (43). However, the
method can provide reliable estimates of intake of groups
(43). Accordingly, in this study, all comparisons about
dietary intake are limited to those among categories of

self-perceived body weight. The observed positive associa-
tion of dietary intake with selected biomarkers as discussed
above also increases confidence in the dietary data. Esti-
mates of prevalence of micronutrient inadequacy from 24-
hour recall data are likely to be overestimated because of
intraindividual variation in food intake. Therefore, the re-
sults presented in Table 4 should be interpreted cautiously
as suggestive of trends and limited to the recall day.
One source of measurement error in self-reported dietary
information is the recognized problem of underreporting of
food intake (20,43). Dietary underreporting, especially in
girls, may have contributed to the inability to find signifi-
cant differences in the various outcomes examined. Pub-
lished evidence suggests widely prevalent underreporting of
energy intake among adolescents, with increasing adiposity
being a positive correlate (20,44­47). In this study, BMI
did not relate to reported energy intake; however, the ratio
of EI/BEE was related inversely to BMI in both boys and
girls, suggesting lower energy reporting in relation with
BMI. Self-perceived body-weight status, although strongly
associated with BMI, was not independently related with
reported energy intake or the ratio of EI/BEE, indicating
that BMI was a stronger correlate of dietary energy report-
ing in 12- to 18-year-olds in the NHANES III. Similarly,
there were surprisingly few differences among categories of
self-perceived weight in reported behaviors related to en-
ergy expenditures--exercise and television viewing.
In conclusion, these data suggest that perceiving oneself
as overweight was not reflected in reported food intake of
adolescents; BMI, however, remained an independent cor-
relate of dietary reporting.
