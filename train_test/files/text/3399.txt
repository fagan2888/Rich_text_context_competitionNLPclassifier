Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that adversely
affects a child's communication, socialization, and interests
prior to age 3 with the average onset at 15 months. The
most recent diagnosis rate has indicated that 1 in 50 chil-
dren are affected by autism with the occurrence in boys
being 5 times greater than girls (Blumberg et al., 2013).
Autism is referred to as a spectrum disorder because it
encompasses multiple similarly related disorders as well as
the diagnosis requiring the presence of repetitive patterns
of behavior or activities (Ryan, Hughes, Katsiyannis,
McDaniel, & Sprinkle, 2011). Symptoms range from mild
cognitive, social, and behavioral deficits to more severe
symptoms in which children may suffer from intellectual
disabilities and be nonverbal. A variety of treatments and
strategies have been developed and implemented to reme-
diate the deficits that are associated with autism spectrum
disorders (ASD). With the growing prevalence and diagno-
sis rate of ASD and the current emphasis in education on
inclusion, Social Stories are increasingly being used as a
method of changing the social understanding and behaviors
of these children to be socially acceptable (Cihak, Kildare,
Smith, McMahon, & Quinn-Brown, 2012). The following
is a discussion of acceptable social skills and social compe-
tence as well as the use of video modeling (VM) with Social
Stories as an instructional strategy with individuals who
have been diagnosed on the autism spectrum.
Social Skills Interventions
Individuals who have been diagnosed on the autism spec-
trum typically have difficulty with social interactions because
of deficits in the area of social skills and social competence.
These skills are critical to the successful integration into
inclusive environments such as school, the community, and
at job placements.According to Wheeler, Mayton, and Carter
(2015), there are five categories of intervention that have
been shown to be effective and that qualify as evidence-
based interventions. These categories include but are not
limited to (a) social skills training groups, (b) VM, (c) social
narratives, (d) self-management, and (e) naturalistic inter-
vention (Wheeler et al., 2015). Taking into consideration that
those diagnosed on the autism spectrum generally demon-
strate the ability to process visual stimuli more efficiently
than others, it is essential to consider their visual learning
strengths when determining which intervention is most
appropriate. VM accomplishes this effectively by presenting

The Use of Computer-Assisted
Instruction as an Instructional Tool to
Teach Social Stories to Individuals Who
Have Been Diagnosed on the Autism
Spectrum
Nanette Edeiken-Cooperman1
Abstract
This article discusses the use of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) to teach Social Stories as a method of positively affecting
the social understanding and behaviors of learners who have been diagnosed on the autism spectrum. As the diagnosis rate
for those with ASD continues to rise along with the practice of including these learners in the general education environment,
there is an increasing need to identify evidence-based practices that focus on the acquisition and remediation of social-
communication skills, social skills, and social competence. A variety of strategies have been developed and implemented to
remediate deficits in these areas. The use of CAI is an approach that has been proven to accommodate both the needs and
the visual learning styles of these learners.

VM as an Instructional Tool
The use of VM and video self-modeling (VSM) as an instruc-
tional strategy to improve a learner's communi-cation,
behavior, and academic performance in the classroom has
demonstrated significant success (Cihak et al., 2012).
According to Sansosti and Powell-Smith (2008), a child
learns to memorize and imitate target behaviors when those
behaviors are modeled on video and presented in a system-
atic and discrete manner. In addition, VM is appropriate for
use in the school or home and has consistently demonstrated
effectiveness for teaching skills to children with ASD and for
use as an intervention approach. This success is attributed to
the motivation that is created in the learning environment by
computer-assisted instruction (CAI; Sansosti & Powell-
Smith, 2008). Therefore, because most children with ASD
are fascinated with computers and iPads, they are intrinsi-
cally motivated to learn. Although the research to support the
effectiveness of CAI is limited, schools are increasingly
using assistive technology in the classroom with children
who have been diagnosed on the autism spectrum.According
to King, Thomeczek, Voreis, and Scott (2014), "the advent of
the Apple iPad in 2010, in particular, has contributed to this
increase in use of CAI with children with ASD" (p. 2). They
go on to say that the growth in technology is "outpacing
research, education professionals are implementing use of
iPads and apps without research-based guidance on how to
do so effectively and efficiently" (p. 3).
The techniques of VM and VSM can readily be applied to
the use of Social Stories to benefit the academic, behavioral,
and social outcomes of students with ASD. A Social Story
describes a situation, skill, or concept in terms of relevant
social cues, perspectives, and common responses in a spe-
cifically defined style and format (Gray, 1994). Generally,
the Social Story is presented to the student prior to the situa-
tion occurring to help rehearse the scenario. The goal is to
share accurate social information in the format of an indi-
vidualized short story intended to increase appropriate social
interactions of children with ASD. Over the past several
years, researchers have demonstrated the success of Social
Stories when used to remediate a wide variety of problem
behaviors (Scattone, Tingstrom, & Wilczynski, 2006). It is
for these reasons that teachers are now integrating the use of
VM of Social Stories on iPads into their classrooms in order
to increase the success rate of those learners who are included
into the general education classrooms. This process has led
to the addition of the development of Social Stories using an
iPad or similar device into the curriculum of pre-service
teachers.
The skill of developing personalized video models is
essential for pre-service teachers who are currently attending
certification programs in either elementary or special
education. Research has reported results that personalized
video models are more effective than commercially distrib-
uted video models (Palechka & MacDonald, 2010) and that
there is a "consistent degree of procedural fidelity and con-
sistent levels of reinforcement" with the use of the iPad when
implementing instruction in academics or student behavior
(Neely, Rispoli, Camargo, Davis, & Boles, 2013, p. 515).
Therefore, our challenge in higher education is to ensure that
professors in pre-service teaching programs have available
to them iPads to instruct their students how to develop and
implement programs in the classroom that target appropriate
social skills for individuals who have been diagnosed on the
autism spectrum.
Conclusion
As the diagnosis rate for those with ASD continues to rise
along with the practice of including these learners in the gen-
eral education environment, there is an increasing need to
identify evidence-based practices that focus on the acquisi-
tion and remediation of social-communication skills, social
skills, and social competence. The use of technology is an
approach that accommodates the needs and the visual learn-
ing styles of these learners. It has been reported that there are
potential advantages when using iPads as an intervention
delivery system rather than other types of assistive technol-
ogy (Kagohara et al., 2013). Kagohara et al. (2013) found that
iPads "are readily available, relatively inexpensive, and
appear to be intuitive to operate" (p. 155). In addition, they
are less stigmatizing when used as an instructional aid because
they are a socially accepted device. The literature confirms
that it is essential to evaluate our pre-service programs and
determine within what courses we can include training in the
use of assistive technology, more specifically using this tech-
nology to implement the strategy of Social Stories.
