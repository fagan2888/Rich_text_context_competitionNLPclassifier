Prevalence of Sexually Transmitted Infections Among
Female Adolescents Aged 14 to 19 in the United States
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: The combined prevalence of
the most common STIs among female adolescents and the
relationship of STI prevalence with sexual behavior in this
population have not been comprehensively evaluated by using
nationally representative data.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Among US female adolescents, STI
burden is substantial, and HPV is the most prevalent STI. STIs
appear to be acquired rapidly after sexual initiation, which
reinforces the need for prevention efforts, including HPV vaccination,
well before the onset of sexual activity.
abstract
OBJECTIVE: Most young women initiate sexual activity during adoles-
cence; risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) accompanies this
initiation. In this study we estimated the prevalence of the most com-
mon STIs among a representative sample of female adolescents in the
United States.
METHODS: Data were analyzed from 838 females who were aged 14 to
19 and participating in the nationally representative National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003­2004. After interview and ex-
amination, survey participants provided biological specimens for lab-
oratory testing. The main outcome was weighted prevalence of at least
1 of 5 STIs: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomo-
nas vaginalis, herpes simplex virus type 2, and human papillomavirus
(HPV) (any of 23 high-risk types or type 6 or 11).
RESULTS: Prevalence of any of the 5 STIs was 24.1% among all and
37.7% among sexually experienced female adolescents. HPV (23 high-
risk types or type 6 or 11) was the most common STI among all female
adolescents (prevalence: 18.3%), followed by C trachomatis infection
(prevalence: 3.9%). Prevalence of any of the STIs was 25.6% among
those whose age was the same or 1 year greater than their age at
sexual initiation and 19.7% among those who reported only 1 lifetime
sex partner.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of STIs among female adolescents is
substantial, and STIs begin to be acquired soon after sexual initia-
tion and with few sex partners. These findings support early and
comprehensive sex education, routine HPV vaccination at the age of
11 to 12 years, and C trachomatis screening of sexually active fe-
male adolescents. Pediatrics 2009;124:1505­1512

The majority of young women initiate
sexual activity during adolescence,1
and risk for sexually transmitted infec-
tions (STIs) accompanies this initia-
tion. Although the course of many of
these STIs is benign, even without
treatment, some infections may lead to
long-term sequelae, including pelvic
inflammatory disease, infertility, and
cervical cancer. A number of STIs also
increase the risk for acquiring HIV in-
fection. Community-based studies and
national surveillance data suggest
that at least some subpopulations of
adolescents have high STI rates2­4;
however, these data are not nationally
representative.
Recent analyses of US population-
based data have shown varying
prevalences of several individual
STIs among female adolescents,5­8 but
there has been no in-depth analysis of
data in this age group. Estimates of
overall STI prevalence and its associa-
tion with sexual behavior among fe-
male adolescents would help to quan-
tify the magnitude of STI risk in this
vulnerable population and inform pre-
vention efforts. We undertook this
study to estimate the prevalence of the
most common STIs among a represen-
tative sample of females aged 14 to 19
in the United States.
METHODS
Study Population and Survey
Design
We analyzed data collected from fe-
males who were aged 14 to 19 and par-
ticipating in the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
2003­2004. The NHANES is conducted
by the National Center for Health Sta-
tistics of the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention and uses a com-
plex, stratified, multistage probability
sampling design to sample the US non-
institutionalized civilian population
randomly.9 The NHANES 2003­2004 had
10 122 participants, reflecting a 79%
interview rate.10 Race/ethnicity catego-
ries were defined as non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, and Mexican Ameri-
can using self-reported information.11
Participants who did not fit into 1 of
these categories were classified as
"other." Non-Hispanic black and Mexi-
can American participants and adoles-
cents aged 12 to 19 were oversampled.
Poverty index ratio12 values of 1 were
considered below and values of 1
were considered at or above the pov-
erty level.
Survey participants were interviewed,
underwent a standardized physical ex-
amination, and submitted biological
specimens. Sexual history information
wascollectedbyusingaudiocomputer-
assisted self-interview. "Sex" was de-
fined as vaginal, oral, or anal sex. We
defined "sexually experienced" as a
"yes" response to the question, "Have
you ever had sex?" The Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention institu-
tional review board approved NHANES
2003­2004 protocols. All survey partic-
ipants who were aged 18 provided
written, informed consent. Parents
gave written consent for minors (aged
18), accompanied by the minors'
assent.
Laboratory Tests and Methods
In the NHANES 2003­2004, female par-
ticipants who were aged 14 to 19 pro-
vided urine, sera, and self-collected
vaginal swab specimens for analysis.
Urine was tested for Chlamydia tra-
chomatis (chlamydia) and Neisseria
gonorrhoeae (gonorrhea) by using
BDProbeTecET(BectonDickinson,Frank-
lin Lakes, NJ).13 Sera were tested for
herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) an-
tibodies with a solid-phase enzymatic
immunodot assay14 that was based on
glycoprotein gG2. Vaginal swab speci-
mens were tested for Trichomonas
vaginalis (trichomonas) and human
papillomavirus (HPV) by using sepa-
rate polymerase chain reaction tests.
A TaqMan-based polymerase chain re-
action method was used to detect
trichomonas.15 HPV detection and typ-
ing were performed on swab DNA ex-
tracts by using the Roche prototype
line blot assay (Roche Molecular Sys-
tems Inc, Pleasanton, CA) and addi-
tional techniques as previously de-
scribed.5 We defined high-risk HPV
types as types 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39,
45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 67, 68, 69,
70, 73, 82, 85, and IS39. Participants
could obtain their test results by tele-
phone by using a password-protected
system. Those who did not call were
sent up to 3 reminder letters. Partici-
pants with positive STI results were
given information about their infec-
tion(s) and advised to seek medical
care. Those without health care provid-
ers were given names of area clinics
that provide STI services.
Statistical Analyses
We estimated the weighted preva-
lence of HPV, gonorrhea, chlamydia,
trichomonas, and HSV-2 infections in
female adolescents who were aged 14
to 19. Evaluation of HPV infection was
restricted to HPV types that are most
likely to cause clinically important dis-
ease: the 23 high-risk HPV types de-
fined already, which are responsible
for cervical and other cancers,16 and
low-risk types 6 and 11, which are re-
sponsible for 90% of genital warts.17
We designated this HPV variable "high-
risk or 6 or 11" HPV (HR/6/11 HPV),
which was considered positive when
any high-risk HPV type or type 6 or 11
was detected. To measure the overall
prevalence of at least 1 of these 5 STIs,
we defined a composite STI variable,
"any STI," as a positive test for HR/6/11
HPV or gonorrhea or chlamydia or
trichomonas or HSV-2 infection. We
limited analysis of this composite vari-
able to participants with laboratory re-
sults for all 5 STIs. We calculated
weighted prevalence estimates among
1506 FORHAN et al
all female adolescents and among
those who were sexually experienced.
We evaluated "any STI" prevalence by
selected demographic and sexual be-
havioral characteristics including age,
race/ethnicity, poverty level, number
of lifetime sex partners, and duration
of sexual activity. Duration of sexual
activity was defined as current age in
years minus year of age at sexual ini-
tiation. We also evaluated HR/6/11
HPV infection prevalence separately
from prevalence of the remaining 4
STIs (gonorrhea or chlamydia or
trichomonas or HSV-2) according to
these characteristics.
All prevalence estimates were weighted
using NHANES 2003­2004 examination
weights to represent the total US civil-
ian, noninstitutionalized population
and to account for oversampling and
nonresponse to the interview and
physical examination.18 Using weights
with additional nonresponse adjust-
ment for missing laboratory results
produced prevalence estimates within
95% confidence intervals (CIs) deter-
mined by the original NHANES weights;
therefore, we made no additional
adjustments.19
Prevalence estimate CIs were calcu-
lated by using logit transformation.
Variance estimates were calculated by
using a Taylor series linearization that
incorporated the survey's complex
sample design.20 Relative SEs (RSEs)
were computed for each weighted
prevalence estimate as (SE/estimate) 
100. A prevalence estimate with an RSE
of 30% is considered unstable and
should be interpreted cautiously.
Bivariate statistical associations were
summarized with unadjusted odds ra-
tios (ORs); corresponding P values
were based on a Wald F statistic. We
calculated adjusted ORs (aORs) for the
main outcome, "any STI," and for the
other 2 outcomes, HR/6/11 HPV in-
fection and gonorrhea, chlamydia,
trichomonas, or HSV-2 infection, by us-
ing multivariate logistic regression
models that included age, race/ethnic-
ity, poverty level, number of lifetime
sex partners, and duration of sexual
activity. We tested for all pairwise in-
teractions for the models presented.
Satterthwaite adjusted F P values are
reported. SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC) and SAS-callable SUDAAN
(Research Triangle Institute, Re-
search Triangle Park, NC) were used
for all analyses.
RESULTS
Of 838 female adolescent participants
in the NHANES 2003­2004, 820 (98%)
were examined, 806 (96%) had at least
1 STI laboratory result available, and
590 (70%) had test results for all 5
STIs. Participants who were aged 14 to
15 were more likely to have missing
test results than those who were aged
16 to 19 (37.0% vs 22.8%; P  .003), as
were participants who had never had
sex (34.3% vs 16.6% among the sexu-
ally experienced; P  .008).
Prevalence of STIs
The prevalence of any of these STIs was
24.1% (95% CI: 18.4%­30.9%; Table 1).
The most prevalent STI was HR/6/11
HPV infection (18.3% [95% CI: 13.5%­
24.8%]), followed by chlamydia infec-
tion (3.9% [95% CI: 2.2%­6.9%]).
Among those who were sexually expe-
rienced, prevalence of any of these
STIs was 37.7% (95% CI: 28.8%­47.5%),
prevalence of HR/6/11 HPV infection
was 29.5% (95% CI: 22.6%­38.4%), and
of chlamydia infection was 7.1% (95%
CI: 4.1%­12.2%). Of female adolescents
with at least 1 STI, 15.8% (95% CI:
11.2%­21.8%) had 1. The vast major-
ity (79.3%) of those with 1 STI had
HR/6/11 HPV as 1 of their infections.
STI Prevalence According to
Demographic Characteristics
Prevalence of any of the 5 STIs varied
by age (Table 2). Among participants
who were aged 14 to 15, prevalence
was 14.1%, although this estimate
should be interpreted with caution be-
cause of small numbers (RSE  30).
Prevalence among participants who
were aged 18 to 19 was 33.8% (P  .01,
versus those aged 14 to 15). Preva-
lence of any of these STIs was similar
among non-Hispanic white (19.4%) and
Mexican American (18.0%) partici-
pants but higher among non-Hispanic
black participants (43.9%; P  .001,
versus non-Hispanic white partici-
pants).
For the HR/6/11 HPV STI outcome, we
found statistically significant differ-
ences in prevalence by age and race/
ethnicity. HR/6/11 HPV prevalence was
standard error 26.7% among those
who were aged 18 to 19 vs 9.4% (RSE 
30) among those who were aged 14 to

15 (P  .005). Non-Hispanic black fe-
male adolescents had a higher preva-
lence of HR/6/11 HPV infection (33.7%)
than did either non-Hispanic white
(15.9%; P  .01) or Mexican American
(14.0%; P  .01) participants.
Prevalence of any of the other 4 STIs--
gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomonas,
or HSV-2--varied significantly by race/
ethnicity and poverty level. Prevalence
of any of these 4 STIs among non-
Hispanic black female adolescents
(21.2%) was greater than among ei-
ther non-Hispanic white (5.1%; P 
.001) or Mexican American (6.6%; P 
.02) participants.
STI Prevalence According to Sexual
Behavioral Characteristics
STI prevalence varied by duration of
sexual activity and by number of life-
time sex partners (Table 2). Among
female adolescents whose age was
the same or 1 year greater than their
age at sexual initiation, prevalence of
any of the 5 STIs was 25.6%; among
those whose age was at least 2 years
greater, prevalence was 49.2% (P 
.001). Even for those whose age was
the same as at sexual initiation (ie,
1 year of sexual experience), prev-
alence of any STI was 19.2%. Female
adolescents who reported only 1 life-
time sex partner had 19.7% preva-
lence of any of the STIs; prevalence
increased to 53.5% among those who
reported 3 partners (P  .001, ver-
sus 1 lifetime partner).
Prevalence of HR/6/11 HPV infection
was 22.5% among female adolescents
whose age was the same or 1 year
greater than their age at sexual initia-
tion; among those whose age was at
least 2 years greater, prevalence was
36.7% (P  .03). HR/6/11 HPV prevalence
for those who reported having had 1 life-
time sex partner was 16.4% and for
those who reported 3 partners, 41.2%
(P  .003, versus 1 partner).
The prevalence of gonorrhea, chla-
mydia, trichomonas, or HSV-2 infection
was 6.8% (RSE 30) among female ad-
olescents whose age was the same or
1 year greater than their age at sexual
initiation and 19.3% among those whose
age was at least 2 years greater (P 
.004). The prevalence of any of these 4
STIs was higher for young women with
morelifetimesexpartners,increasingto
20.8% among those with 3 partners
(P  .02, versus 1 partner).

Multivariate Analysis
After adjustment for other factors,
non-Hispanic black participants had
almost 4 times the odds of having any
of the STIs compared with non-
Hispanic white participants (aOR: 3.6
[95% CI: 1.9­6.8]; Table 3). The odds of
having any of the 5 STIs were also
greater for those with more lifetime
sex partners (aOR: 4.9 [95% CI:
2.2­11.0]; 3 vs 1 lifetime partner). In
the multivariate analysis of HR/6/11
HPV infection, findings were similar
(non-Hispanic black versus non-
Hispanic white participants, aOR: 2.5
[95% CI: 1.2­5.1]; 3 vs 1 lifetime sex
partner, aOR: 4.4 [95% CI: 1.8­10.5]). In
the multivariate analysis that evalu-
ated gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomo-
nas, or HSV-2 infection, the association
with race/ethnicity was pronounced
(non-Hispanic black versus non-
Hispanic white participants: aOR: 5.2
[95% CI: 2.0­13.8]). We found no statis-
tically significant interactions between
any factors in the models.
DISCUSSION
We found a high burden of STIs among
US female adolescents; 1 in 4 was
infected with HR/6/11 HPV, gonorrhea,
chlamydia, trichomonas, or HSV-2. Ap-
plying the prevalence of these 5 com-
mon STIs to 2004 US Census data, we
predict that nationwide nearly 3 mil-
lion female individuals aged 14 to 19
have at least 1 of these infections. To
our knowledge, this is the first pub-
lished report of the overall prevalence
of the most common STIs among US
female adolescents by using data from
a nationally representative sample. On
the basis of published estimates for
each of the 5 individual STIs,5­8 the 24%
STI prevalence found in this analysis
was not unexpected; however, this ag-
gregate estimate strengthens our un-
derstanding of STI epidemiology in fe-
male adolescents and highlights the
need for enhanced prevention and
treatment efforts in this group.
Our data suggest rapid STI acquisi-
tion soon after sexual initiation and
among teens with few lifetime sex
partners. Prevalence of any of these
STIs was 26% among female adoles-
cents whose age was the same or 1
year greater than their age at sexual
initiation and 20% among those who
reported only 1 lifetime sex partner.
HPV infection was the predominant
STI. Winer et al21 observed that
college-aged women acquired HPV
infection soon after sexual initiation.
Our data suggest similarly high rates
of HR/6/11 HPV infection soon after
sexual initiation among a representative
sample of female adolescents. Our find-
ings are also consistent with a recent
study of college-aged women that estab-
lished high risk for HPV acquisition with
a first sex partner.22 Although HPV infec-
tion was most prevalent, prevalence of
the other 4 STIs also increased soon af-
ter sexual initiation. These findings em-
phasize the need to educate young peo-
pleaboutsexualissuesearly,wellbefore
sexual initiation.
HPV infection accounted for nearly
three quarters of the overall STI prev-
alence among female adolescents. The
NHANES 2003­2004 cycle was the first
to include HPV DNA testing.5 Findings
from our analysis of these data further
elucidate the epidemiology of HPV in-
fections in female adolescents. It is im-
portant to recognize that 90% of new
HPV infections clear without treatment
within 2 years23; however, a proportion
of HPV infections will persist, leaving

infected women at risk for cervical
cancer. A quadrivalent HPV vaccine,
which prevents HPV types that are re-
sponsible for 70% of cervical cancers
and 90% of genital warts, is now rec-
ommended for routine use by girls
aged 11 to 12 and for "catch-up" vacci-
nation by those aged 13 to 26.24 Immu-
nization isencouragedbeforesexualini-
tiation24 because the vaccine is most
efficacious among HPV-naive women.25,26
Because a substantial proportion of fe-
male adolescents acquire HPV infection
soon after sexual initiation and parents
typically fail to predict the timing of their
daughters' sexual initiation,27,28 routine
vaccination of preadolescent girls ac-
cording to current recommendations is
of critical importance.
Chlamydia infection was found among
7%ofsexuallyactivefemaleadolescents.
This treatable, primarily asymptomatic
bacterial STI can result in potentially
serious long-term consequences for
women, including pelvic inflammatory
diseaseandsubsequentinfertility.Tode-
crease chlamydia prevalence and se-
quelae, routine annual screening is rec-
ommended for sexually active women
who are aged 25 years.29 Despite this,
recent data indicate that only 42% of eli-
gibleyoungwomenwhowereenrolledin
US commercial and Medicaid health
plans received annual chlamydia
screening in 2007.30 Raising awareness
among teens and their parents and
health care providers about the need for
routine chlamydia screening is a funda-
mental component of protecting young
women from chlamydia sequelae.31
Prevalence estimates of HSV-2, tri-
chomonas, and gonorrhea infection
were relatively low among female ado-
lescents, although precise estimates
for trichomonas and gonorrhea were
unreliable because of small numbers.
Our HSV-2 seroprevalence estimates
may not reflect the full spectrum of
genital HSV infection in this population
because HSV-1 may account for an in-
creasing proportion of symptomatic
first-episode genital herpes, especially
among youth.32 In addition, a recent
analysis of HSV-2 infections in the
United States revealed a five-fold in-
crease in HSV-2 seroprevalence be-
tween females who were aged 14 to 19
and those aged 20 to 29 years.7 Thus, ad-
olescents soon face markedly increased
risk for HSV-2 infection as young adults.
HSV-2 infection, the most common cause
of genital ulcer disease, is chronic and
lifelong and thus differs from the treat-
able infections trichomonas and gonor-
rhea; however, all 3 of these infections
have been linked with HIV infection. A
large body of evidence indicates that
HSV-2 infection increases the risk of HIV
acquisition33; trichomonas and gonor-
rhea have also been associated with in-
creased HIV risk.34,35
We found substantial racial dispari-
ties in STI prevalence among US fe-
male adolescents. Our findings, like
those of other studies,36,37 suggest
that racial differences in STI preva-
lence cannot be fully explained by in-
dividual risk behaviors. Specifically,
non-Hispanic black participants with
the same duration of sexual experi-
ence or number of lifetime sex part-
ners as their white counterparts
were more likely to have at least 1 of
the 5 STIs. Social, environmental, and
population-level determinants, such
as poverty, barriers to health care ac-
cess, and the characteristics of sexual
networks, may contribute to greater STI
rates among non-Hispanic black individ-
uals.38,39 HighSTIprevalencewithinasex-
ualnetworkincreasestheriskforSTIex-
posure with any given sexual encounter.
Resources for broad strategies to close
the racial gap need to be directed to
communities at risk. Although STIs
among adolescents of all races and eth-
nicities are a concern, increased efforts
are needed to ensure that all subpopula-
tions have the same opportunities for
sexual health.
Reducing STIs among female adoles-
cents and thereby protecting their re-
productive health requires a compre-
hensive approach. Adolescents should
be provided thorough skill-based edu-
cation about prevention strategies to
lower STI risk, such as delaying sexual
initiation, minimizing numbers of sex
partners, avoiding concurrent sexual
partnerships,40 and using condoms
consistently and correctly.41 In addi-
tion, adolescents should be informed
about the ability of those who are aged
14 to obtain medical care for STIs
without parental consent in all 50
states.42 The recent increase in teen-
age birth rates43 also highlights the im-
portance of providing education about
available contraceptive methods. Ide-
ally, adolescents' parents, educators,
and health care providers all would
participate in providing such educa-
tion. Quality parent­adolescent com-
munication about sexuality, sexual
risk, and condom use can result in ad-
olescents' reporting more recent and
consistent condom use.44,45 Compre-
hensive sex education programs can
increase STI knowledge and prevent
risky sexual behaviors.46 Health care
providers' counseling about safer sex
can result in fewer STIs.47 In addition,
health care providers can promote
recommended primary and secondary
STI prevention methods, including rou-
tine HPV vaccination of girls at ages 11
to 12 and screening all sexually active
female adolescents for chlamydia.
Our analysis had several limitations.
We may have underestimated overall
STI prevalence because the compos-
ite STI variable did not include syph-
ilis or HIV. Only female adolescents
who were aged 18 to 19 were tested
for syphilis and HIV; no cases of ei-
ther infection were found (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention,
unpublished data). Furthermore, we
restricted our analysis of HPV to types
that are more likely to cause disease.
1510 FORHAN et al
Conversely, we may have overestimated
STI prevalence because missing labora-
tory results were more common among
lower risk younger and sexually inexpe-
rienced participants. However, even if all
missing tests from examined adoles-
centswerenegative,theoverallSTIprev-
alence estimate would be 19.7%, within
our estimate's confidence limits. Inaccu-
racies in self-reported data could have
led to misclassification of sexual behav-
ior categories. This may explain pre-
valent STIs among those who reported
no sexual experience, although these
estimates were unstable. False-positive
test results or STI acquisition from non-
penetrativesexualactivity(especiallyfor
HPV)48 could also account for these
STIs.
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that the STI bur-
den is substantial among female ado-
lescents, and the most common STIs
begin to be acquired soon after sexual
initiation. These findings highlight the
importance of both primary and sec-
ondary STI prevention, including early,
skill-based sex education; HPV vaccina-
tion of preadolescent girls; and chla-
mydia screening of all sexually active
female adolescents. A comprehensive
approach designed to decrease STIs
among female adolescents would also
include steps to lessen racial dispari-
ties and to ensure that all adolescents
have access to such sex education and
sexual health care well before they ini-
tiate sexual activity.
