Effectiveness of Two Evidence-Based Programs in
Participants With Arthritis: Findings From the
Active for Life Initiative
MEGHAN BARUTH AND SARA WILCOX
Objective. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in the US. Strong evidence suggests that physical activity (PA) is
beneficial to those with arthritis. This study examined whether changes in PA and PA-related outcomes from two general
evidence-based PA programs (Active Choices [AC] and Active Living Every Day [ALED]) differed in participants with and
without arthritis.
Methods. Active for Life was a 4-year, multicenter, translational initiative that evaluated the effects of AC and ALED on
PA and PA-related outcomes. Participants self-reported arthritis, PA, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and
satisfaction with body appearance and function. A subset of participants completed functional fitness tests.
Results. Participants (n  2,413 AC, n  3,191 ALED) completed at least one outcome measure; 619 ALED participants
completed at least one functional fitness test. Significant improvements in all PA and PA-related outcomes were seen for
people with and without arthritis with the exception of depressive symptoms and perceived stress, which only improved
in ALED participants. In general, effect sizes were similar for those with and without arthritis.
Conclusion. ALED and AC, both general behavioral PA programs, produced positive and meaningful changes in PA and
a number of PA-related behaviors in participants with and without arthritis, pointing to the potential appropriateness of
these evidence-based programs for people with arthritis.
INTRODUCTION
An estimated 50 million adults in the US had self-reported
doctor-diagnosed arthritis in 2007­2009 (1). By 2030, this
number is projected to increase to 67 million (2). Among
adults ages 65 years, 50% reported an arthritis diagnosis
in 2007­2009, and of these, 45.4% reported arthritis-
attributable activity limitations (1). Arthritis and other
rheumatic conditions remain the leading cause of disabil-
ity among adults in the US (3).
There is strong evidence supporting the beneficial ef-
fects of physical activity (PA) for individuals with arthritis
(4). The American College of Rheumatology highlights the
importance of PA for the management of arthritis (5,6).
Despite this, a majority of individuals with arthritis do not
engage in sufficient amounts of PA necessary to experience
such benefits, and are less active than those without ar-
thritis (7). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) Arthritis Program recommends 6 evidence-based
PA programs for individuals with arthritis (8). The two
initial programs (i.e., Arthritis Foundation Aquatics Pro-
gram, People with Arthritis Can Exercise [9]) were devel-
oped specifically for people with arthritis. However, there
is growing evidence that programs not designed exclu-
sively for people with arthritis may be beneficial and ap-
propriate for people with arthritis (8).
Two non­arthritis-specific evidenced-based PA pro-
grams, Active Living Every Day (ALED) and Enhance-
Fitness, were recently added to the CDC Arthritis Pro-
gram's list of recommended interventions. Such programs
are appealing in that a more "generic" intervention can be
offered to the entire general population, yet still provide
benefits to those with arthritis. This may be particularly
advantageous for organizations that do not have resources
available to offer a wide range of disease-specific interven-
tions (8).
Active for Life (AFL) was a translational initiative that
successfully implemented two evidence-based PA behav-
ior modification programs (Active Choices [AC] and
ALED) into "real-world" community settings with diverse

populations. AFL resulted in significant improvements in
PA and a number of other PA-related variables (10). A
large proportion (64%) of participants in AFL self-reported
doctor-diagnosed arthritis. The purpose of this study was
to examine whether changes in PA and PA-related out-
comes in participants in AC and ALED, both general PA
programs, differed in participants with and without
arthritis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The methodology and major findings of AFL are described
in more detail elsewhere (10,11). AFL was a 4-year initia-
tive that evaluated the effects of two evidence-based be-
havioral PA interventions, ALED and AC, on self-reported
PA and other PA-related outcomes. The interventions
were implemented by 9 public health, senior service,
health care, and grassroots organizations across 12 sites.
The programs were typically implemented by non­health
care professional staff members from each organization
(11).
Interventions. In AFL, AC was a 6-month telephone-
based program (12­14). Participants received an initial
face-to-face orientation, followed by up to 8 one-on-one
telephone counseling calls. The counseling was tailored to
the participant's readiness for change (15) and emphasized
key behavioral constructs in the social cognitive theory
(16). During each call, the health educator discussed the
participant's current level of PA, their readiness for
change, a specific behavior change principle, and modified
PA goals, if necessary.
ALED is a 20-week lifestyle PA intervention (17,18).
Each week, participants attended a 60-minute group-based
session that focused on behavior change principles consis-
tent with the social cognitive theory (16). The goal of
ALED was to help participants accumulate a minimum of
30 minutes of PA on most days of the week. Participants
were encouraged to provide support and share successes
and challenges with one another.
Both AC and ALED are behavioral programs that do not
include structured PA as a part of the intervention ses-
sions. In AFL, 4 organizations implemented AC and 5
organizations implemented ALED.
Participants. The 9 participating organizations re-
cruited participants through their networks and from the
community at large. Recruitment strategies were tailored
to the community they targeted. The most successful re-
cruitment efforts were onsite staff recruitment, presenta-
tions at the facilities, direct mail, flyers, newsletters, and
local media. Participants were ages 50 years, sedentary
or underactive (2 days/week and 120 minutes/week),
and free of medical conditions or disabilities that required
higher levels of supervision, as determined by lead staff
(e.g., unstable angina) (10).
Research design and procedures. This study used a
pre-post design, with data collected from 2003 to 2007. All
of the participants completed an informed consent form
approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the Uni-
versity of South Carolina and Texas A&M Health Science
Center, and review boards or legal departments of the lead
organizations.
Self-report outcomes. Comprehensive surveys were ad-
ministered to all participants in year 1 (100 per site) and
to the first 100 participants per site in years 3 and 4. This
decision was made a priori, as it was not necessary for
adequate statistical power to collect survey data on all
participants across all years. A shortened version of the
survey that collected several key outcomes was given to
the rest of the participants in years 3 and 4. Although the
intervention was delivered during year 2, outcome data
were not collected.
After year 3, the lead organizations taking part in AFL
requested that the ALED program be shortened to 12
weeks. Although the program was shortened in year 4 (i.e.,
lasted 12 weeks, not 20 weeks), steps were taken to ensure
that essential elements were maintained (10). Participants
taking part in the ALED intervention during year 4 com-
pleted a 12- (all short versions) and 20-week posttest sur-
vey. This study only uses the 20-week data from year 4.
Sociodemographic, health-related, and other variables.
Participants self-reported height and weight to compute
body mass index (BMI), date of birth, sex, marital status,
race/ethnicity, and education level. Self-reported absence
or presence of arthritis was assessed by asking partici-
pants, "Have you ever been told by a doctor, nurse, or
other health professional that you had arthritis?" Dropout
rates were tracked by AFL staff.
PA. The 41-item Community Healthy Activities Model
Program for Seniors questionnaire assessed PA (19). This
self-report measure assesses the frequency and duration of
various activities typically undertaken by older adults for
exercise, activities undertaken in the course of their day
that are physical in nature, and recreational activities that
provide PA. Hours/weeks spent in moderate- to vigorous-
intensity PA (MVPA; metabolic equivalents value of 3.0
[20,21]) were calculated. This measure is valid (22), has
acceptable test­retest reliability (22), and is sensitive to
change (13,19,21,23,24).
PA was also assessed using a secondary 3-item measure
from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System that
assessed participation, frequency, and duration of moder-

 General physical activity programs (i.e., Active
Choices and Active Living Every Day) may be ap-
propriate for people with arthritis.
 Improvements in physical activity, physical func-
tioning, and other physical activity­related behav-
iors were similar for those with and without arthritis.

ate intensity PA (25). Participants were classified as meet-
ing (30 minutes/day, 5 days/week) or not meeting PA
recommendations (26).
Depressive symptoms. The 10-item Center for Epidemi-
ologic Studies Depression Scale (27­29) assessed symp-
toms of depression during the past week. Scores range
from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater depres-
sive symptoms.
Perceived stress. A 4-item version of the Perceived
Stress Scale (30,31) measured the degree to which situa-
tions in one's life are appraised as stressful. Scores range
from 0 to 16, with higher scores indicating greater per-
ceived stress.
Body satisfaction. Satisfaction over the past 4 weeks
with 9 aspects of body appearance and function was as-
sessed on a 7-point scale. Two subscales were derived
from factor analysis (32): satisfaction with body appear-
ance (3 items) and satisfaction with body function (6
items). Scores range from 9 to 9 (appearance) and from
18 to 18 (function), with higher scores indicating
greater satisfaction.
Physical performance outcomes. One ALED site admin-
istered 4 performance-based physical functioning tests.
Each test was administered during all 4 years of AFL with
the exception of the Chair Sit-and-Reach Test, which was
only administered during year 3. The methods used in
administering physical functioning measures are reported
in greater detail elsewhere (33). Lead staff was trained by
an expert in physical functioning in how to administer the
performance-based measures. The test manual and video-
tape provided by Human Kinetics were used to aid train-
ings (34).
30-second Chair Stand Test. The 30-second Chair Stand
Test assessed lower body strength (34). Participants sat in
the middle of a 17-inch high chair with their back straight,
feet flat on the floor, and arms crossed at the wrist and held
against the chest. On the signal "go," participants rose to a
full stand and returned to a fully seated position. Partici-
pants completed as many stands as possible in 30 seconds.
Eight Foot Up-and-Go Test. The Eight Foot Up-and-Go
Test assessed agility and dynamic balance (34). Partici-
pants sat in the middle of a 17-inch high chair with their
back straight, feet flat on the floor, and hands on the thighs.
On the signal "go," participants got up from the chair,
walked as quickly as possible around a cone placed 8 feet
from the chair, and sat back down. Measured in seconds, a
shorter time is better.
Chair Sit-and-Reach Test. The Chair Sit-and-Reach
Test assessed lower body (primarily hamstring) flexibility
(34). Participants sat on the front edge of a 17-inch high
chair and extended one leg out as straight as possible in
front of the hip, with the foot flexed and heel resting on the
floor. Participants slowly bent forward at the hip joint,
reaching as far forward as possible toward (or past) the
toes. The distance from the tips of the middle fingers to the
top of the shoe was measured. Measured in inches, a
longer distance is better.
30-Foot Walk Test. The 30-Foot Walk Test assessed gait
speed (35). On the signal "ready, go," participants started
walking at their normal speed. The stopwatch did not start
until the participant crossed the 10-foot line, and was
subsequently stopped when the participant crossed the
40-foot line. The time, in seconds, to complete the test was
converted to gait speed (meters/second). A faster gait
speed is better.
Impairment status. Rikli and Jones' (34) age- and sex-
based normative data were used to classify participants as
impaired (less than or equal to twenty-fifth percentile) or
not impaired at baseline and postprogram on the 30-Sec-
ond Chair Stand Test, the Eight Foot Up-and-Go Test, and
the Chair Sit-and-Reach Test. Because normative data for
the 30-Foot Walk Test are not available from Rikli and
Jones (34), data from a recent meta-analysis (36) were used
to classify participants' gait speed as impaired (less than or
equal to twenty-fifth percentile) or not impaired at base-
line and postprogram.
Statistical analyses. Participants who completed any
baseline outcome measure (or physical functioning test for
subanalyses) and had complete model covariates were in-
cluded in the baseline demographic analyses. Differences
in postprogram outcome measure completion and dropout
rates, as well as demographic, health-related, and other
key outcome variables, among participants with and with-
out arthritis were examined with the chi-square test or
analyses of variance. Square root transformations were
conducted on both baseline and postprogram scores for
MVPA and the Eight Foot Up-and-Go Test, as these mea-
sures were skewed and/or had high kurtosis. The transfor-
mations successfully corrected the problem(s).
Repeated-measures analyses of covariance that con-
trolled for site clustering (using SAS PROC MIXED) were
conducted to examine whether changes in outcomes from
baseline to postprogram differed by arthritis status (yes/
no). Changes in dichotomous outcome variables were as-
sessed using SAS PROC GLIMMIX. Arthritis  time inter-
actions were tested in each model, and all models
controlled for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and BMI. Using the
adjusted means and the unadjusted baseline SD, effect
sizes (d  [postprogram mean  baseline mean] / baseline
SD) were computed for each of the continuous outcome
variables (37). Using Cohen's effect sizes (38), d  0.2 was
considered small, d  0.5 was considered medium, and
d  0.8 was considered large.
RESULTS
A total of 5,604 participants completed at least one base-
line outcome measure (n  2,413 AC, n  3,191 ALED).
Figure 1 shows the number of participants with baseline
and followup data for each intervention group by arthritis
status. Self-reported arthritis was reported in 56% (AC)
and 61% (ALED) of participants. Table 1 shows the base-
line demographic, health-related, and outcome measures
1040 Baruth and Wilcox
for each intervention group, and for those with and with-
out arthritis separately. In both groups, those with arthritis
were more likely to be women and have higher BMIs; were
older, less educated, less likely to be married, more de-
pressed, and less satisfied with their body function; and
were more likely to have higher levels of perceived stress.
In the AC group, participants with arthritis engaged in less
PA, were less likely to be African American, and were less
likely to be Hispanic. In the ALED group, participants with
arthritis were less likely to meet PA recommendations and
less likely to be satisfied with their body appearance.
At least one physical functioning test was completed by
619 participants at baseline (from one ALED site). Of this
sample, 68% self-reported arthritis. Table 2 shows the
demographic, health-related, and outcome measures for
those with and without arthritis separately. Participants
with arthritis were more likely to be women, performed
poorer on the Eight Foot Up-and-Go Test and 30-Foot Walk
Test, and were more likely to be classified as impaired on
the Eight Foot Up-and-Go Test than those without
arthritis.
Postmeasure followup and dropout rates are shown in
Table 3. There were no significant differences in the per-
centages of participants with and without arthritis who
completed postmeasures or dropped out, for any interven-
tion group.
AC. The adjusted baseline and postprogram mean
scores for all outcomes, as well as the calculated effect
sizes for participants with and without arthritis in the AC
intervention, are shown in Table 4. There was a significant
arthritis  time interaction for MVPA (P  0.01), meeting
PA recommendations (P  0.047), and satisfaction with
body appearance (P  0.04). Significant improvements
were seen in all outcomes for both participants with and
without arthritis; however, those without arthritis im-
proved significantly more than those with arthritis. There
were no other significant arthritis  time interactions for
any of the other variables, indicating no difference in
change over time for participants with and without arthri-
tis. There was a significant main effect for satisfaction with
body function (P  0.001), indicating improvements over
time regardless of arthritis status. There were no signifi-
cant time effects for depressive symptoms (P  0.16) or
perceived stress (P  0.27).
ALED. The adjusted baseline and postprogram mean
scores for all outcomes, as well as the calculated effect
sizes for participants with and without arthritis in the
ALED intervention, are shown in Table 5. There was a
significant arthritis  time interaction for depressive
symptoms (P  0.008), where depressive symptoms signif-
icantly decreased in participants with arthritis but did not
change in participants without arthritis. There were no
other significant arthritis  time interactions for any of the
other variables, indicating no difference in change
over time for participants with and without arthritis. There
were significant main effects for MVPA (P  0.0001), meet-

DISCUSSION
ALED and AC, both general PA programs, produced posi-
tive and meaningful changes in PA and a number of PA-
related behaviors in participants with arthritis, pointing to
the potential appropriateness of these evidence-based pro-
grams for people with arthritis. With the exception of
depressive symptoms and perceived stress in the AC pro-
gram (which did not improve in those without arthritis
either), significant improvements in all PA, PA-related,
and physical functioning outcomes were seen for people
with arthritis. With a few exceptions, improvements (ef-
fect sizes) were similar in magnitude to those without
arthritis.
Although PA is beneficial to people with arthritis, the
symptoms of arthritis often deter individuals from engag-
ing in regular PA (39,40). Medium to large increases (ef-
fects sizes 0.62­0.68) in PA were seen for individuals with
arthritis in both intervention groups. The percentage of
participants with arthritis meeting PA recommendations
also nearly tripled in both groups. Furthermore, there were
no negative outcomes reported, lending support to the
safety of ALED and AC for individuals with arthritis. It is
difficult to compare our findings to other studies due to
differences in study design. However, thus far, findings
from arthritis-specific community-based PA interventions
have found mixed results (41­43).
Depression is common among people with arthritis
(44,45). Depressive symptoms did not change for any par-

ticipants in the AC program, and they did significantly
decrease among ALED participants with arthritis (small
effect size), but not among those without arthritis. Al-
though participants with arthritis were more depressed at
baseline than those without arthritis and therefore had
more room for improvement, depression scores in all par-
ticipants were quite low. ALED is a group-based program
where social interactions occur often, and support from
other group members is encouraged. Participants may
have found reassurance in talking to other participants
who were attempting to make similar lifestyle changes.
This may have been especially useful and important to
participants with arthritis who may experience unique
challenges and barriers when becoming active. Similar to
our findings for AC, no changes in depressive symptoms
have been reported in other community-based arthritis-
specific intervention studies (41,42); however, as stated
earlier, caution should be taken when comparing findings
due to differences in study design.
Perceived stress (ALED only) and satisfaction with body
appearance and function also significantly improved in
participants with arthritis (small to medium effect sizes).
These variables have not been measured in other studies
targeting people with arthritis; therefore, it is hard to make
comparisons across studies. However, these measures are
important and pertinent to individuals with arthritis. Be-
ing satisfied with one's body appearance and function
might be particularly important for people with arthritis,
who may be more likely to experience problems with
energy, stamina, strength, and functioning.
Nearly 40% of adults with arthritis report arthritis-
attributable activity limitations (46). Functional declines
are common in people with arthritis (47­50), although PA
may help to prevent them. Significant improvements were
seen in all physical functioning measures in the sub-
sample of participants with arthritis performing the phys-
ical functioning tests. Effect sizes were in the small to
medium range; applied across the population, improve-
ments in function would be very meaningful. The percent-
age of participants with arthritis who were classified as
"impaired" also significantly decreased between 11% and
18%. These findings are promising, as individuals with
arthritis who may already be experiencing declines in
physical functioning can also benefit from PA-based pro-
grams (i.e., ALED); it may be possible to reverse such
impairments. A recent meta-analysis (51) of randomized
controlled trials found that community-deliverable exer-
cise interventions resulted in a small but statistically sig-
nificant improvement in physical functioning.
Although MVPA, meeting PA recommendations, and
satisfaction with body appearance significantly improved
in AC participants with arthritis, the improvements were
not as large as those seen in participants without arthritis.
One possible explanation for these findings is that AC did

not include pain management strategies (although ALED
did not either); pain and other arthritis-specific symptoms
can be unique barriers to PA in this population. Additional
studies are needed to understand how these outcomes may
be improved even more in individuals with arthritis. Fur-
thermore, although improvements in PA and a number of
PA-related variables, all of which are important and rele-
vant for people with arthritis, resulted from the AC and
ALED interventions, this study did not measure other vari-
ables that are more specific to individuals with arthritis
(e.g., pain, fatigue, stiffness). Therefore, it is unclear
whether ALED and AC would produce meaningful
changes in such variables. Future studies are needed to
explore this in more detail.
Although the effectiveness of AC among individuals
with arthritis has not been evaluated (or at least reported),
the effectiveness of ALED has. Fontaine and colleagues
(52) conducted a pilot study in a sample of participants
with fibromyalgia based "loosely" on ALED. However, in-
formation specific to fibromyalgia was incorporated into
the intervention, and therefore the original ALED was not
tested. Callahan et al (53) tested the effectiveness of ALED
in a large sample of participants with arthritis. Although
results from the trial have not yet been published, quali-
tative data indicate that ALED was safe and appropriate for
people with arthritis, and modifications to the program to
make it more relevant for people with arthritis were sug-
gested by the participants and instructors (53).
This study had a number of strengths, including the
large sample size, the diverse sample, and the objective
measures of functional fitness on a subsample. We also
recognize study limitations. Perhaps the largest limitation
is the lack of a control group. However, the goal of AFL
was not to test the efficacy of AC and ALED, but to test
whether both programs could be successfully translated
into the community. Therefore, although internal validity
may be threatened, the focus on external validity adds to
the overall science-based literature. Second, the presence
of arthritis was self-reported; there was no validity check
to confirm the presence of doctor-diagnosed arthritis.
Third, the type and severity of arthritis were not measured;
it is possible that our sample had low symptoms (i.e., pain,
fatigue) that may have influenced our findings. Partici-
pants with more severe symptoms might not have done as
well in the programs. Fourth, a number of self-report mea-
sures were used, which could be subject to biases. Finally,
because only one site (ALED) administered functional fit-
ness tests and because not all participants were required to
complete the long version of the survey, sample sizes for
some outcomes were significantly lower.
Arthritis and its related complications remain an enor-
mous public health problem. The CDC recommends a
number of PA interventions for people with arthritis, some
of which were recently added (8). Although options are
available to clinicians and public health officials, partici-
pation in these programs is very low (9). AC and ALED
resulted in improvements in PA, physical functioning, and
other PA-related variables in participants with arthritis
that were similar to those without arthritis. PA programs
such as AC and ALED that target the general population,
but may also result in improvements in PA, functional
fitness, and other PA-related behavior in individuals with
arthritis, are promising, as a larger and perhaps more di-
verse group of individuals could be reached.
