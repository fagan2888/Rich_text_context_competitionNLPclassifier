OBJECTIVE: To update the social distribution of women's obesity in the developing world and, in particular, to identify the
specific level of economic development at which, if any, women's obesity in the developing world starts to fuel inequities in
health.
DESIGN: Multilevel logistic regression analyses applied to anthropometric and socioeconomic data collected by nationally
representative cross-sectional surveys conducted from 1992 to 2000 in 37 developing countries within a wide range of world
regions and stages of economic development (gross national product (GNP) from US$190 to 4440 per capita).
SUBJECTS: In total, 148 579 nonpregnant women aged 20­49 y.
MEASUREMENTS: Body mass index to assess obesity status; quartiles of years of education to assess woman's socioeconomic
status (SES), and GNP per capita to assess country's stage of economic development.
RESULTS: Belonging to the lower SES group confers strong protection against obesity in low-income economies, but it is a
systematic risk factor for the disease in upper-middle income developing economies. A multilevel logistic modelFincluding an
interaction term between the country's GNP and each woman's SESFindicates that obesity starts to fuel health inequities in the
developing world when the GNP reaches a value of about US$2500 per capita.
CONCLUSIONS: For most upper-middle income economies and part of the lower-middle income economies, obesity among
adult women is already a relevant booster of health inequities and, in the absence of concerted national public actions to prevent
obesity, economic growth will greatly expand the list of developing countries where this situation occurs.

Introduction
There is abundant documentation in the developing coun-
tries on the burden of nutritional deficiencies, infections,
and maternal and perinatal problems being highly concen-
trated among the poor; however, much less information is
available on the inequities in health concerning noncom-
municable diseases, including obesityFa disease in great
expansion at the global level.1
An exhaustive review of the literature, based on studies
published between 1933 and 1988 (130 in developed
populations and only 14 in developing populations) con-
cluded that socioeconomic status (SES) and women's obesity
tended to be inversely related in developed populations and
directly related in developing populations. In nearly 90% of
the studies on developing populations, women's obesity was
found to be more frequent among the higher SES groups; in
nearly 10%, no association was detected; and none of the
studies found obesity more prevalent among the lower SES
groups.2 In other words, until the late 1980s, there was no
documented evidence that women's obesity could fuel
inequities in health in the developing world.
More recent studies on SES and women's obesity in
developing populations indicate a different situation. In
some middle-income developing countries (eg, Chile,3
Brazil4­5 and Curac
¸ao6), case studies conducted between
1987 and 1994 have shown inverse, or at least curvilinear
associations, between SES and women's obesity. Specifically
in Brazil, the comparison of results from three successive
national surveys conducted in 1975, 1989, and 1997
detected a progressive shifting in women's obesity toward

oped south-eastern region and, in general, in urban areas.7­8
Finally, a comprehensive study on data from national
surveys conducted in developing countries between 1987
and 1996 on women of reproductive ages found obesity
levels in low-income countries greatly concentrated among
women with a higher SES while, in relatively more developed
countries, obesity levels were more equally distributed in the
general population.9
This study uses recent data from nationally representative
surveys conducted in 37 developing countries to update the
social distribution of adult female obesity and, in particular,
to identify the specific level of economic development at
which, if any, women's obesity in the developing world starts
to fuel inequities in health.
Methods
We included national data sets from surveys conducted
between 1992 and 2000 in 37 developing countries in our
analyses: 19 in Sub-Sahara Africa, seven in Latin America and
the Caribbean (including Brazil and Mexico), six in Asia
(including China and India), and four in North Africa and
the Middle East. The China and Mexico data sets are from
national health and nutrition surveys conducted by these
countries in 1997 and 1999, respectively, and the Vietnam
data set corresponds to the World Bank Living Standard
Measurement Survey (LSMS) conducted in 1997.10­12 All
other national data sets correspond to standardized USAID/
Macro Demographic Health Surveys (DHSs)13 conducted
between 1992 and 2000. DHS data sets were downloaded
from http://www.macroint.com/dhs/ or obtained directly
from the State Statistical Offices (SSOs) that conducted the
surveys. We used only the most recent data for countries in
which two or more DHSs were conducted in the period.
We restricted our analyses in all data sets to nonpregnant
women aged 20­49 y. In the case of the DHSs, most women
were mothers of children under 5 years of age. The average
sample size was 4266 ranging from 1460 in Bolivia to 21 171
in Peru, with a total of 157 844 women studied. Average
nonresponse rates were less than 0.2% for weight and height
measurements and less than 0.7% for questions on SES.
We considered the following variables in our analyses:
obesity status (body mass index (BMI) Z30.0 kg/m2), age
groups (5-year intervals) and SES. Weight and height
measurements were obtained in all surveys following
standard procedures.14 We used relative levels of formal
education in each country as a proxy of overall SESFna-
mely, the country's quartiles of the women's years of
schooling. Cutpoints for the quartiles were selected in each
country in such a way that each quartile would contain, as
close as possible, one-fourth of the studied population. In
countries where years of schooling were too clustered around
certain values (eg zero years), we were able to define only
three or two SES groups. In the case of two groups we labelled
them as Q1 (the lower quartile) and Q4 (the higher quartile).
In the case of three groups we labelled them as Q1, Q2 or Q3
(according to which was bigger of Q4 and Q1, respectively)
and Q4. We used the gross national product (GNP) per capita
at the year of the survey to express the level of economic
development of each country included in the analyses. For
certain analyses we grouped the studied countries into (a)
low-income economies (GNP oUS$745 per capita), (b)
lower-middle-income economies (GNP oUS$745­2994 per
capita), and (c) upper-middle-income economies (GNP Z
US$2995 per capita). The World Bank was the source for both
the GNP values (all deflated for 2001) and the GNP-based
country's classification.
We initially calculated for each country the overall age-
standardized prevalence of obesity using the direct method
of standardization, and having the age distribution of the
world population15 as a reference (survey-specific sample
weights were used, so all estimates are nationally represen-
tativeFexcept for the China survey, which only represents
eight provinces). We also calculated for each country the age-
standardized prevalence of obesity among women belonging
to different SES groups. To summarize and test the direction
of the association between SES and obesity in each country,
we calculated age-standardized prevalence ratios (with 95%
confidence intervals) in the higher SES groupFhaving the
lower SES group as a reference. To specifically address the
hypothesis that the direction and intensity of the association
between SES and obesity would vary across the countriesF
depending on the country's level of economic develop-
mentFwe first merged all national data sets into one single
data set. In this single world data set, we studied the
association between SES and obesity in three strata of
countries grouped as low-income, lower-middle-income,
and upper-middle-income economies. The null hypothesis
of homogeneity of the associations across the strata was
tested using the Mantel-Haenszel statistic.16
After testing the homogeneity of the associations between
SES and obesity across the country's GNP categories, and as a
final step of our analytical strategy, we ran a multilevel
logistic model17 on the risk of obesity having as explanatory
variables: women's age (5-y intervals), women's SES (educa-
tion quartiles), the country's GNP per capita, and an
interaction term between the women's SES and the country's
GNP per capita. From this model we produced predicted
probabilities of obesity for each SES group at different levels
of economic development. We evaluated the statistical
significance of each model parameter, including the inter-
action term, using the Wald test. We assessed the perfor-
mance of the logistic model in predicting obesity probability
by calculating the area under the ROC (receiving operator
characteristic) curve (this area is equal to the probability that
a random obese woman in the sample has a higher predicted
probability of obesity than a random nonobese woman).18
Both the one-level and the multilevel statistical analyses of
this study took into account survey sampling weights and
design effects resulting from the specific sample design

statistical software19 for one-level analyses and MlwiN
multilevel modelling software20 for multilevel analyses.
Results
Figure 1 plots the age-standardized prevalence of obesity
against the GNP per capita for 37 developing countries.
Although not linear, obesity prevalence clearly tended to
increase with the level of GNP per capita. Almost two-third
of the variability found in national obesity figures (from
0.3% in Vietnam to 34.2% in Jordan) could be explained by
the logarithm of the country's GNP per capita.
Table 1 displays the social distribution of women's obesity
in the same 37 developing countries ordered according to
GNP per capita. It is clear that not only was the overall
prevalence of obesity influenced by the country's GNP level,
but also its social distribution. In countries with low-income
economies (n ¼ 21), obesity tended to increase strongly with
quartiles of women's formal education (our country-specific
SES measure). In these countries, the risk of obesity in the
higher SES group was often five or 10 times higher than in
the lower SES group. In countries with lower-middle-income
economies (n ¼ 12), the pattern of association between SES
and obesity was mixed. We found direct association between
SES and obesity in Bolivia, Senegal, Egypt, Morocco,
Guatemala, Namibia, and Peru; no association in Uzbekistan,
Kazakhstan, Colombia, and Peru; and inverse association in
Dominican Republic and Jordan. Finally, in the upper-
middle-income economies (Turkey, South Africa, Brazil,
and Mexico) the risk of obesity was always significantly
higher in the lower than in higher SES group.
Table 2 describes homogeneity tests concerning
the association between women's SES and obesity across
low, lower-middle and upper-middle-income economies.
It was clear that as the country GNP increased, the
relative excess of obesity of the higher SES group decreased,
or was even reverted. For instance, the age-standardized
prevalence ratio for obesity among women in the higher SES
group vis-a
`-vis the lower SES group was reduced from 2.63 to
1.08, and then reverted to 0.67 when we considered
successively low-income, lower-middle-income and upper-
middle-income economies. Similar trends were observed
when we compared women in the intermediate SES groups
to women in the lower SES group. The hypothesis of
homogeneity of the association between women's SES and
obesity was refuted in all comparisons (P-value o0.0001),
and this indicated that the level of economic development
was a statistically significant modifier of the SES effect on
obesity.
Figure 2 displays predictive estimates from a two-level
logistic model that included as explanatory variables of
obesity: women's age, women's SES, the logarithm of the
country's GNP per capita, and an interaction term between
women's SES and the country's GNP (all terms significant at
Po0.0001Fmodel parameters are available from the authors
upon request). The area under the ROC curve for this model
was 0.774 (0.95 CI 0.770­0.777). The model estimates
confirm the great influence of the country's economic
development on the association between SES and obesity
and show that the predicted probability of women's obesity
in the lower SES group exceeds the same probability in the
higher SES group at a GNP value of approximately US$2500
per capita. Essentially, this indicated that US$2500 is the
GNP value `necessary' to make women's obesity fuel health
inequities in the developing world.
Discussion
Anthropometric and SES data from 148 579 young- and
middle-age women living in 37 developing countries
provided us with the opportunity to analyze the social
distribution of obesity in a relatively recent period
(1992­2000), and within a wide range of developing regions
and stages of economic development (GNP from US$190 to
4440 per capita). Our results show that belonging to the
lower SES group confers a strong protection against obesity in
low-income economies (GNP below US$745 per capita), but it

is a systematic risk factor for the disease in upper-middle-
income economies (GNPZUS$2995 per capita). A multilevel
logistic model including an interaction term between the
country's GNP and each woman's SES indicated that obesity
starts to fuel health inequities in the developing world when
the GNP reaches a value of about US$2500 per capita. These
results show a much greater nuance about obesity and SES in
the developing world than heretofore presented.2

National wealth, individual SES, and obesity

The nationwide probabilistic samples, large sample sizes,
wide range of stages of economic development and regions
of the world, highly standardized data collection procedures,
and appropriate multilevel analysesFall favour the internal
and external validity of our findings. The main limitation of
our study is that it only surveyed women of reproductive
ages, most of them mothers of one or more children under 5
years of age. This fact probably biased our national estimates
of obesity toward higher values given the fact that pregnancy
can be a contributory factor to obesity. In addition, it may be
that women who have lower education may be more likely
to be represented in our national data sets. However, it is less
likely that the selection bias toward women of reproductive
ages with young children could affect substantially the
pattern of association between SES and obesity observed in
different GNP intervals.
A recent national study on the social distribution of
obesity conducted among the whole adult female population
of the more, and the less, economically developed regions of
Brazil (GNP per capita of US$4913 and 1728, respectively)
showed findings similar to the ones described by our
international study: obese women were more common
among the top 25% richer families in the lower-income
region (14.5% as opposed to 7.7% in the bottom 25% poorer
families) while in the higher-income region obese women
were more common among the bottom 25% poorer families
(14.1% as opposed to 8.9% in the top 25% richer families).21
Another limitation of our study is the use of a single
proxyFeducational levelFto assess SES. Although educa-
tion is the SES indicator easiest to measure and with greatest
cross cultural relevance,22 income or occupation may be a
better measure of an individual's social status in some
populations.23 Unfortunately, data on income and occupa-
tion were not available in all surveys.
The reasons the lower SES groups in the developing
populations were protected against obesity have been
usually explained as being related to (a) food scarcity and
patterns of high-energy expenditures commonly found
among the poor; (b) the greater capacity of the elite to
obtain adequate food supplies, and cultural values favouring
fat body shapes.2 Most likely, these same reasons explain the
greater obesity among lower SES women in developing
countries with low-income economies.
Explanations of the inverse association between women's
obesity and SES, shown to exist in part of the lower-middle-
income and all upper-middle-income economies, are com-
plex and more research on this topic is certainly necessary.
Likely reasons are: (1) after a certain level of economic
growthFexpressed by a GNP of about US$2500 per capita,
according to our estimatesFlack of food and or high energy
expenditure patterns are no longer common in the society,
even among its poorer social segments and (2) the lower
level of education and health-related knowledge among the
poor, coupled with a greater difficulty to acquire more
expensive low-energy dense foods (eg, fruits, vegetables, and
whole-grain cereals), less leisure-time, and fewer opportu-
nities for recreational exercise.1­2 Furthermore, people living
in circumstances of low SES may be more at the mercy of an
obesogenic environment because their eating and activity
are more likely the `default choices' on offer.24
Regardless of the explanations underlying the shifting of
obesity toward the poorest SES groups in part of the
developing world, this phenomenon has important policy
implications. First, for many developing countries (most or
all upper-middle-income economies, and part of the lower-
middle-income economies), obesity should be seenFat least
among womenFas a relevant booster of the already high
health inequities generated by the exhaustively documented
unequal social distribution of nutritional deficiencies, in-
fectious diseases, and maternal and perinatal conditions. It
should be noted that, in addition to being a disease in its
own right, obesity substantially increases the risk of several

fatal and nonfatal, but highly debilitating, noncommunic-
able diseasesFparticularly cardiovascular diseases, non-
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, several endocrine and
metabolic disturbances, sleep apnoea, osteoarthritis, certain
types of cancer, and several psychological problems.1
Second, in the absence of concerted national public actions
to prevent obesity in the developing world, economic
growthFa highly desirable and needed goal for any
developing countryFwill tend to greatly expand the list of
developing countries where obesity will fuel inequities in
health.
Finally, our results make it most clear that public actions to
prevent both obesity and obesity-related health inequities in
the developing world should include population education
strategiesFnot restricted to the eliteFon the determinants
and consequences of obesity as well as changes in the
physical, economic, and sociocultural environment that
make healthier choices concerning diet and physical activity
behaviours feasible for all social classes.
