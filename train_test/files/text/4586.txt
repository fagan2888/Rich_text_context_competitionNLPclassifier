Abstract
Objective: To compare the medium-term clinical and radiographic outcomes of Dynesys dynamic
stabilization and posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) for treatment of multisegmental lumbar
degenerative disease.
Methods: Fifty-seven patients with multisegmental lumbar degenerative disease underwent
Dynesys stabilization (n ¼ 26) or PLIF (n ¼ 31) from December 2008 to February 2010. The mean
follow-up period was 50.3 (range, 46­65) months. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using a visual
analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry disability index (ODI). Radiographic evaluations included
disc height and range of motion (ROM) of the operative segments and proximal adjacent segment
on lumbar flexion-extension X-rays. The intervertebral disc signal change was defined by magnetic
resonance imaging, and disc degeneration was classified by the Pfirrmann grade.
Results: The clinical outcomes including the VAS score and ODI were significantly improved in
both groups at 3 months and the final follow-up, but the difference between the two was not
significant. At the final follow-up, the disc height of stabilized segments in both groups was
significantly increased; the increase was more notable in the Dynesys than PLIF group. The ROM of
stabilized segments at the final follow-up decreased from 6.20 to 2.76 and 6.56 to 0.00 in the
Dynesys and PLIF groups, respectively. There was no distinct change in the height of the proximal
adjacent segment in the two groups. The ROM of the proximal adjacent segment in both groups
increased significantly at the final follow-up; the change was significantly greater in the PLIF than
Dynesys group. Only one case of adjacent segment degeneration occurred in the PLIF group, and
this patient underwent a second operation.

Conclusions: Both Dynesys stabilization and PLIF can improve the clinical and radiographic
outcomes of multisegmental lumbar degenerative disease. Compared with PLIF, Dynesys
stabilization can maintain the mobility of the stabilized segments with less influence on the
proximal adjacent segment and may help to prevent the occurrence of adjacent segment
degeneration. Dynesys is reliable for the treatment of multisegmental lumbar degenerative disease
at the medium-term follow-up.

Introduction
Multisegmental lumbar disc disease is a
common problem in spinal surgery and
primarily occurs in older patients.
Posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF)
was historically considered the gold stand-
ard treatment for lumbar degenerative dis-
ease. With increasing research, more reports
have described the deficiencies of fusion
surgery, such as adjacent segment degener-
ation (ASD) and acquired spinal instability
after the fusion operation. Non-fusion tech-
nology has been developed to solve these
problems. As a posterior lumbar non-fusion
technique, Dynesys dynamic stabilization
has become more widely performed.1,2 The
Dynesys system was designed by Dubois
et al. and was first applied in the clinical
setting in 1994. The Dynesys dynamic sta-
bilization system aims to maintain the range
of motion (ROM) of the fixed segment,
preserve the lumbar spinal stability, and
prevent ASD. Clinical reports of Dynesys
stabilization have mainly focused on the
short-term clinical efficacy; medium- and
long-term clinical follow-up studies, espe-
cially those involving PLIF as a control, are
lacking.3 In this retrospective study, we
analyzed the clinical effects and radiographic
results of Dynesys dynamic stabilization
versus PLIF in the treatment of multiseg-
mental lumbar degenerative disease.
Materials and methods
General data
A total of 57 patients underwent operations
for multisegmental lumbar degenerative dis-
ease at The Affiliated Hospital of School of
Medicine of Ningbo University from
December 2008 to February 2010. Enrolled
patients were randomized to either the
Dynesys or PLIF group. The Dynesys
group comprised 26 patients (14 female,
12 male) with a mean age of 49.6 years
(range, 36­73 years). Of these 26 patients,
16 (61.5%) had lumbar intervertebral disc
herniation and 10 (38.5%) had degenerative
spinal stenosis. Eighteen patients had
involvement of two segments, and eight
patients had involvement of three segments.
The PLIF group comprised 31 patients
(18 female, 13 male) with a mean age of
52.5 years (range, 38­77 years). Of these
31 patients, 18 (58.1%) had lumbar inter-
vertebral disc herniation and 13 (41.9%) had
degenerative spinal stenosis. Nineteen
patients had involvement of 2 segments,
11 patients had involvement of 3 segments,
and 1 patient had involvement of 4
segments.
Symptoms in this study included low
back pain with or without neurologic clau-
dication or sciatic pain. Three months of
nonoperative treatment failed in all patients.
This study was approved by the Human
Wu et al. 1563
Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital
of the Medical College of Ningbo
University. Each patient enrolled in this
study provided written informed consent.
All patients were followed up for at
least 46 months and underwent X-ray
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
examinations.
The inclusion criteria were involvement
of two or more lumbar segments, neurogenic
claudication caused by lumbar spinal sten-
osis, or low back or leg pain caused by
degenerative intervertebral disc disease.4­6
The exclusion criteria were severe osteopor-
osis; severe spinal deformity; grade !2
lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis; pro-
gressive intervertebral disc degeneration;
serious instability associated with lumbar
spine disease; obesity (body mass index of
!30 kg/m2); serious heart, brain, or lung
disease; trauma; infection; malignant
tumors; history of lumbar spine surgery;
and pelvic-related disease.
Surgical techniques
All operations were performed by the same
surgical team at a single institution. The
patients were placed in the prone position,
and a standard surgical procedure was
used for posterior lumbar spine surgery.
Through a midline incision and after
subperiosteal dissection of the erector
spine muscles, the affected segment and
entrance points for the pedicle screws were
exposed. Radiographic guidance with a C-
arm X-ray machine was used to ensure
that the Dynesys pedicle screws were safely
inserted. Interlaminar decompression and
laminotomy were performed in the
Dynesys group depending on each patient's
condition. However, extensive decompres-
sion such as semi-laminectomy or total
laminectomy was performed in patients
with severe stenosis or far lateral stenosis.
All procedures were carefully performed to
avoid destruction of the facet joints.7
Polycarbonate urethane spacers and poly-
ethylene terephthalate cords were accur-
ately assembled according to the technical
suggestions provided by the manufacturer.
Finally, the incision was flushed, a drain-
age tube was placed, and the incision was
closed in a step-by-step manner.
Patients in the PLIF group underwent
standard semi-laminectomy or total lamin-
ectomy according to the severity of their
disease. The nucleus pulposus was carefully
removed, nerve root was completely
released, and an interbody fusion cage
filled with artificial bone material was
inserted.
Postoperative management
Antibiotics were routinely administered for
1 to 3 days after surgery. The drainage tube
was removed 24 to 72 hours postoperatively.
The patients were encouraged to cough and
produce expectoration as well as move their
lower limbs after the operation to prevent
deep vein thrombosis. Patients in the
Dynesys group wore a soft lumbar orthosis
for 12 weeks. In contrast, patients in the
PLIF group wore a hard orthosis for
3 months.
Clinical and radiological evaluation
Evaluations were performed preoperatively,
3 months postoperatively, and at the final
follow-up. Back and leg pain were evaluated
using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the
Oswestry disability index (ODI).8,9
Radiological evaluation included lumbar
flexion-extension and lateral standing radi-
ography, computed tomography, and MRI.
Radiological measurements were per-
formed as follows. (1) The average interver-
tebral space height (AH) was calculated using
the ventral intervertebral space height (VH),
dorsal intervertebral space height (DH), and
central intervertebral space height (CH):
AH ¼ (VH þ CH þ DH)/3. (2) Segmental
1564 Journal of International Medical Research 45(5)
ROM was calculated as the angle between
the inferior surface of the upper vertebrae
and the superior surface of the lower
vertebrae on the lateral standing lumbar
flexion-extension X-ray. (3) All patients
underwent lumbar MRI both preoperatively
and at the final follow-up to evaluate
changes in the height of the adjacent degen-
erative intervertebral discs and signals of the
intervertebral discs. Disc degeneration was
graded on T2-weighted sagittal and axial
MRI according to the modified method
described by Pfirrmann.10
Radiologic ASD was diagnosed by the
development of olisthesis of 4 mm, a 10
angular change on flexion-extension lateral
radiographs, 10% loss of disc height, or
grade !2 disc deterioration (University of
California at Los Angeles disc degeneration
grading scale).3,11,12 On MRI, radiologic
ASD was also diagnosed by a modified
Pfirrmann grade of IV or V or the presence
of spinal stenosis or disc herniation at the
adjacent level. Clinical ASD was diagnosed
in the presence of (1) symptomatic spinal
stenosis, (2) intractable back pain, or (3)
subsequent sagittal or coronal balance as
suggested by Cheh et al.13 Symptomatic
spinal stenosis was defined as MRI-diag-
nosed stenosis accompanied by clinical
neurologic claudication.
Radiographs were evaluated three
times independently by two experienced
spine surgeons in this study. We used the
mean value of each parameter in all analyses
and resolved disagreements through discus-
sion or by consultation with a senior
surgeon.
Statistical assessment
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS 18.0 statistics software (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). Measurement data are
presented as mean Æ standard deviation
(SD), and enumeration data were evaluated
with the chi square test. Categorical data
were compared by the Wilcoxon signed rank
test. A P-value of <0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Clinical outcomes
All patients were followed up. The Dynesys
group was followed up for 50.3 months
(range, 46­65 months); the mean operating
time was 158.1 minutes (range, 100­
255 min), and the mean blood loss volume
was 380 ml (range, 200­850 ml). The PLIF
group was followed up for 52.8 months
(range, 48­68 months); the mean operating
time was 182.5 minutes (range, 120­
300 min), and the mean blood loss volume
was 470 ml (range, 250­1080 ml). The sex,
age, follow-up time, and disease distribution
were not significantly different between the
two groups. However, the operation time
and blood loss volume were significantly
lower in the Dynesys than PLIF group
(P < 0.05).
Clinical symptoms such as back and leg
pain were significantly improved at the final
follow-up in both groups. The VAS score
and ODI were also significantly improved at
the 3-month and final follow-ups in both
groups. Moreover, the VAS score and ODI
were significantly better at the final follow-
up than at the 3-month follow-up in
the Dynesys group (P < 0.05) (Tables 1, 2,
and 3).
Radiological outcomes
The preoperative and postoperative radio-
logic parameters in the Dynesys and PLIF
groups are shown in Table 4. At the final
follow-up, the disc height of the fixed seg-
ments was slightly increased in both groups
and significantly increased in the PLIF
group (P < 0.05). ASD frequently occurs
superior to the fixed segment; therefore,
we only evaluated the radiological out-
comes of the proximal adjacent segment
Wu et al. 1565
in this study.14,15 The disc height of the
proximal adjacent segment was not signifi-
cantly decreased in the two groups. The ROM
of the fixed segments in the Dynesys group
decreased from 6.20 preoperatively to 2.76
at the final follow-up; in the PLIF group, the
ROM decreased from 6.56 to 0.00. The
height of the proximal adjacent segment was
not significantly different between the two
groups. The ROM of the proximal adjacent
segment was increased at the final follow-up,
especially in the PLIF group, with a signifi-
cant difference between the two groups
(P < 0.05). Comparison of proximal adjacent
Disc degeneration shows in Table 6. Typical
case as shown in Figure 1­2.
Complications
Two cases of pedicle screw loosening, both
in S1, were found at the final follow-up in
two patients in the Dynesys group. No screw
breakage occurred in the Dynesys group.
One patient in the Dynesys group developed
fat liquefaction that progressed to an inci-
sion infection. Two patients in the PLIF
group developed cerebrospinal fluid leakage
(one from an incision infection and one from
nerve root injury), and one underwent a
second surgery because of symptoms of
ASD. No perioperative death occurred in
either group (Table 5).
Discussion
The Dynesys system was developed by Gilles
Dubois in 1991 and first applied in the
clinical setting in France in 1994.16 The

for multilevel lumbar degenerative disease
(degenerative scoliosis) was first reported in
2010.17 The Dynesys system is used to
preserve the normal function of the fixed
segments and maintain spinal stability, thus
avoiding ASD.18 Under the condition of
keeping certain activity for fixed segments
and lumbar lordosis, Dynesys dynamic
stabilization not only limits abnormal
motion of the unstable segment but also
reduces the load on the intervertebral disc
and facet joint, achieving the therapeutic
goal of the Dynesys system. In contrast to
PLIF, Dynesys technology can carry and
balance the load between vertebrae while
retaining the motor function of the fixed

segments and reduce the influences of stress
and movement of the adjacent segment.
Therefore, the occurrence of ASD can be
avoided or delayed. Additionally, after move-
ment recovery and load delivery, the degen-
erated intervertebral disc has the potential for
self-repair.19 Theoretically, Dynesys dynamic
stabilization has more advantages than
PLIF.
Dynesys stabilization has been performed
for more than 20 years, and many studies
have verified its clinical effects. However,
most of these studies were short-term case
reports; comparative studies with PLIF are
lacking.20,21 Through its retrospective case-
control design, the present study allowed for
comparison of the clinical effects and radio-
graphic characteristics of Dynesys stabiliza-
tion versus PLIF for the treatment of
multisegmental lumbar degenerative dis-
ease. In addition, the average follow-up
duration was more than 46 months. The
clinical effects at all follow-up points showed
obvious improvement over the condition
before treatment (P < 0.05), suggesting
that Dynesys stabilization has a definite
therapeutic effect in treating multisegmental
lumbar degenerative disease. Moreover,
the postoperative lumbar disc height of the
fixed segment was greater than that pre-
operatively (P < 0.05), and the ROM
decreased from 6.20 Æ 1.91 preoperatively
to 2.76 Æ 1.53 at the final follow-up.
This indicates that Dynesys stabilization
partially preserves the motion of the oper-
ated segment based on stabilization of the
lumbar vertebrae. Additionally, there was
no significant difference in the lumbar disc
height or ROM of the proximal adjacent
segment before and after treatment, indicat-
ing that Dynesys stabilization can effectively
reduce the influence of these parameters on
the adjacent segment in the middle-term
follow-up. Dynesys stabilization causes

a relatively small operative wound and
provides a satisfactory effect, and the overall
rate of complications such as implant failure
and breakage was lower than that of PLIF;
therefore, we consider that PLIF can be
replaced by Dynesys dynamic stabilization
for fixation in patients with lumbar degen-
erative disease. In total, of the 172 screws
used among 26 patients who underwent
Dynesys stabilization in this study, only 2
screws had become loose at the medium-
term follow-up, both located at S1, within 6
months postoperatively. These patients had
no associated symptoms, and screw loosen
and breakage were not visible temporarily.
Additionally, no delayed infection occurred
and no postoperative revision was needed.
Stoll et al.22 reported that most cases of
screw loosening occurred in the closest
proximal or closest distal segment.
Consistent with this, both cases of screw
loosening in the present study occurred in
the closest distal segment. Furthermore,
both were located at S1, which can likely
be explained by the difficulty in gaining a
satisfactory angle during implantation
because of the shorter length of the S1
screw and higher tension in the lumbosacral
region. The greater stress of the S1 screw
after a multisegment operation is probably
another cause. Regardless of this complica-
tion, we still believe that Dynesys dynamic
stabilization is safe and effective in
treating multisegmental lumbar degenera-
tive disease.
The clinical features of multisegmental
lumbar degenerative disease are complex
and atypical, making localization difficult.
Extensive decompression and multilevel
fusion have been widely adopted.
However, ASD after multilevel fusion is
attracting increasingly more attention. One
study suggested that 24% to 45% of patients
with lumbar interbody fusion develop accel-
erated ASD,23 which leads to spinal stenosis
of the adjacent segment, vertebral
instability, and facet joint osteoarthritis.
Cadaver studies have revealed that the
pressure and ROM within the adjacent
intervertebral disc after long-level fusion is
clearly higher than that after short-level
fusion.24 In patients with multisegmental
lumbar degenerative disease, the influence of
Dynesys stabilization on the development of
ASD is a current area of clinical research.
When comparing simple lumbar discectomy
and lumbar interbody fusion, Dynesys sta-
bilization is capable of removing the her-
niated nucleus pulposus and releasing nerve
compression. Moreover, it can restore the
lumbar disc height of the operative segment
and maintain the structure of the lumbar
spine. Furthermore, it can preserve the
ROM of the operative segment, reduce the
stress load on the adjacent segment, and
compensation of motion range.16 Many
studies have also supported the idea that
Dynesys stabilization can delay the occur-
rence of adjacent-level degeneration.
However, its specific mechanism is yet
unclear. Ciavarro et al.25 determined the
glycosaminoglycan content of the interver-
tebral disc in the fixed segment and adjacent
segment after Dynesys stabilization using
MRI with delayed enhancement. They
found that the glycosaminoglycan content
was increased at both 6 and 24 months
postoperatively. In addition, the content
was higher 24 months than at 6 months
postoperatively. The authors concluded that
Dynesys stabilization can delay degener-
ation and promote self-repair of the inter-
vertebral disc. Beastall et al.26 made months
MRI follow-up for 24 patients who under-
went Dynesys stabilization and found that
the fixed segment holds part of motion, but
no obvious change occurred at the adjacent
segment; additionally, the anterior height of
the intervertebral space decreased, while
there was no apparent increase of the pos-
terior of intervertebral space. Therefore,
Dynesys stabilization could prevent the
1570 Journal of International Medical Research 45(5)
occurrence of ASD. However, some
researchers doubt the role of Dynesys
stabilization in preventing and releasing
ASD.25­27 Vaga et al.28 performed MRI
with delayed enhancement of the cartilage
and intervertebral discs preoperatively and 6
months postoperatively in patients who
underwent Dynesys stabilization. They dis-
covered that Dynesys stabilization can delay
or partly reverse the degeneration of the
intervertebral disc, especially for patients
with severely degenerative intervertebral
discs. However, Dynesys stabilization
increased the load on the adjacent segment,
which led to the early development of ASD.
After the average 50.3-month follow-up in
the present study, the differences in the
variation of the lumbar space height at the
upper end of the adjacent segment between
the Dynesys and PLIF groups were not
statistically significant. The ROM at the
upper end of the adjacent segment was
greater at the final follow-up than preopera-
tively. Additionally, the ROM at the upper
end of the adjacent segment was greater in
the PLIF than Dynesys group at the final
follow-up, indicating that Dynesys stabiliza-
tion better retains the motion of the adjacent
segment than does PLIF. Moreover, tem-
porary development of adjacent lumbar
spondylosis was not found during follow-
up in the Dynesys group. However, one
patient in the PLIF group required a second
operation because of symptoms of ASD.
The factors that affect the development of
ASD remain unclear. Determination of
whether Dynesys stabilization can actually
prevent the occurrence of ASD requires
further high-quality randomized controlled
trials with long-term follow-up.
In conclusion, Dynesys dynamic stabil-
ization provides a satisfactory medium-term
effect in treating multisegmental lumbar
degenerative disease. Dynesys stabilization
results in a smaller wound, which benefits
for multisegment recovery, and the clinical
follow-up data showed that Dynesys stabil-
ization can partially preserve the ROM of
the fixed segments and limit abnormal
movement of the lumbar spine. It also has
little effect on the adjacent segment and is
associated with a lower incidence of compli-
cations such as screw loosening and break-
age. However, the specific mechanism for
the prevention of ASD remains unclear. No
detailed data are available to verify that
Dynesys stabilization can delay ASD.
Because of the small number of cases in
the present study, determination of the long-
term effects of Dynesys dynamic stabiliza-
tion and its impact on the adjacent segment
requires further clinical research with long-
term follow-up.
