Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) define health as a
state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and
not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (WHO,
2017). Mental health is defined as a state of wellbeing in
which every individual realises his or her own potential,
can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work produc-
tively and fruitfully and is able to make a contribution to
her or his community (World Health Organization and
Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 2014). It is widely
acknowledged that mental wellbeing is a crucial determi-
nant of both individual functioning and societal prosperity
(Diener and Chan, 2011; Field, 2009). The Centre for
Mental Health (2010) estimated the total cost of mental
health problems in England in 2009/2010 was £105.2 bil-
lion, a real term increase of £27.8 billion from 2002/2003.
These figures are inclusive of costs related to health and
social care for people with mental health problems (20%),
lost output in the economy (29%) and the human costs of
reduced quality of life (51%).
The Warwick­Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale
(WEMWBS) has been widely utilised to measure population
levels of mental wellbeing for member countries of the United
Kingdom. In Scotland, 14per cent of respondents were clas-
sified as having `good' mental wellbeing (a WEMWBS
score of over one standard deviation above the mean of
51.05), 73
per cent as having `average' mental wellbeing (a
WEMWBS score of within one standard deviation of the
mean) and 14
per cent as having `poor' mental wellbeing (a
WEMWBS score of more than one standard deviation below
the mean; Braunholtz et al., 2007). In England, 11
per cent
were defined as having `low'mental wellbeing (a score of 39
The relationship between physical
inactivity and mental wellbeing: Findings
from a gamification-based community-wide
physical activity intervention

Abstract
Mental ill health accounts for 13
per cent of total global disease burden with predictions that depression alone will be
the leading cause of disease burden globally by 2030. Poor mental health is consistently associated with deprivation,
low income, unemployment, poor education, poorer physical health and increased health-risk behaviour. A plethora
of research has examined the relationship between physical activity and mental wellbeing; however, the influence of
community-wide gamification-based physical activity interventions on mental wellbeing, to the authors' knowledge, is yet
to be explored. In view of this paucity of attention, the current study examined the relationship between physical activity
and mental wellbeing pre/post a community-wide, gamification-based intervention. The findings revealed that increases in
mental wellbeing were significantly greater for the least active prior to the intervention, and a strong, positive correlation
between increase in physical activity and increase in mental wellbeing was observed.

or less), 77
per cent had average mental wellbeing (a score
between 40 and 62) and 12per cent had high mental wellbe-
ing (a score of 63 or above) (Bryson et al., 2011). While 11per
cent of adults were defined has having `relatively low scores',
the data were negatively skewed with frequency of distribu-
tion spread gradually between those scoring 14 (lowest pos-
sible score) and those scoring 39.
Poor mental wellbeing outcomes
Poor mental health is the largest single source of disease
burden in the United Kingdom and is consistently associ-
ated with deprivation, low income, unemployment, poor
education, poorer physical health and increased health-risk
behaviour (Bhugra, 2010). A study by Richards and Abbot
(2009) provides strong evidence for the severe impact that
poor mental health at childhood could have on adulthood.
The authors analysed longitudinal data from three British
birth cohorts, born in 1946, 1959 and 1970 and discovered a
significant association between emotional problems at ado-
lescence and increasing severity of emotional problems in
adulthood. Adolescents with emotional problems were three
times more likely to have worsened symptoms than those
without emotional difficulties. These data also revealed sig-
nificant associations between early mental health problems
and poor educational achievement, chronic economic inac-
tivity, lower earnings, marital problems, teenage parenthood
and contact with the criminal just system.
Psychosocial outcomes of positive mental
wellbeing
In contrast to the detrimental impact of poor mental health,
positive mental wellbeing has been associated with a breadth
of biopsychosocial benefits.According to Chida and Steptoe
(2008), positive psychological wellbeing is associated with
reduced cardiovascular mortality in healthy and disease
populations. Elsewhere, Keyes (2007) reported that `flour-
ishing' adults who were `completely mentally healthy'
reported the fewest absenteeism, the healthiest psychologi-
cal functioning (including low helplessness, clear goals in
life, high resilience and high intimacy), the lowest risk of
cardiovascular disease, the lowest number of chronic physi-
cal diseases with age, the fewest health limitations of activi-
ties of daily living and lower health care utilisation. More
recently, subjective wellbeing has been associated with
greater health and longevity, income, productivity and
organisational behaviour and a range of psychosocial bene-
fits (including sociability, altruism, reduced risk taking and
greater future time perspective) (De Neve et al., 2013).
Determinants of mental wellbeing
Social inequalities are at the forefront of inequalities in
mental health and wellbeing. A recent report published by
the World Health Organization and Calouste Gulbenkian
Foundation (2014) outlined greater exposure and vulnera-
bility to adverse social, economic and environmental cir-
cumstances as predisposing certain population subgroups
to developing mental health problems. The report elabo-
rated that such inequalities start before birth and accumu-
late throughout life (Allen et al., 2014). It has been argued
that income inequality is a fundamental driver of social
exclusion in England (Piachaud et al., 2009). The report
published by the World Health Organization and Calouste
Gulbenkian Foundation (2014) outlined that a universal
approach must be taken to reduce health inequalities and
improve mental health and wellbeing, arguing that inequal-
ities in mental health exist along a social class gradient and
as such, targeted services will likely miss most of these
inequalities. Factors that influence mental health and well-
being operate at the individual, family, community, struc-
tural and population level, and therefore, a multi-sector
approach is required to address the scale of the problem.
Enhancing social cohesion is a potential avenue for
bridging the health and social inequalities experienced
throughout the world. A socially inclusive society is defined
as one where all people feel valued, their differences are
respected and their basic needs are met so they can live in
dignity (Cappo, 2002). An early literature review by
Kawachi and Berkman (2001) highlighted the well-estab-
lished relationship between strong social relationships and
enhanced mental wellbeing, which has been supported by
more recent evidence (Cacioppo and Cacioppo, 2014;
Santini et al., 2016). Social relationships influence habits
which may be detrimental to health and wellbeing, they pro-
vide a social support mechanism, they can act to mitigate
stress and they provide symbolic purpose and influence
physiological responses to psychological distress and harm
(Allen et al., 2014; Cohen, 2004; Crosnoe and Elder, 2004;
Glynn et al., 1999; Thoits, 1995; Uchino, 2004; Umberson
et al., 2010). As such, social inclusion policies may be a
promising avenue for at least mitigating the detrimental
impact of social inequalities on subsequent shortfalls in
mental wellbeing (Rispel et al., 2009). Fone et al. (2007)
examined population level data from 10,653 adults and dis-
covered that poor mental health was significantly associated
with area-level income deprivation and low social cohesion
after adjusting for individual risk factors. Furthermore, the
authors found high social cohesion significantly modified
the association between income deprivation and mental
health. However, no causal inferences can be made from
this cross-sectional study; an alternative explanation could
be that communities with individuals possessing greater
mental health could be more socially connected.
Physical activity and mental wellbeing
Physical inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for
global mortality, attributed to 6per cent of deaths globally
Harris 3
(WHO, 2016). According to Kruk (2007), physical activity
reduces the risk of developing breast cancer by up to 75per
cent, cardiovascular and heart disease by up to 49per cent,
diabetes by up to 35per cent and colorectal cancer by up to
22
per cent. However, effective interventions to reduce
population levels of physical inactivity, which extend
beyond `standing' or `take the stairs' campaigns, are sparse
(Bauman, 2016). Furthermore, a recent Cochrane system-
atic review concluded insufficient evidence for current
multi-component community-wide interventions citing
scalability is a major weakness with many previous inter-
ventions failing to reach a substantial portion of the com-
munity (Baker et al., 2015).
The evidence base for the relationship between physical
activity and mental wellbeing is well established (see
Mason and Kearns, 2013). For instance, evidence has con-
sistently shown that physical activity is positively associ-
ated with increased mental wellbeing (Bize et al., 2007;
Cerin et al., 2009); however, such reviews have focused
overly on `frequent' physical activity (Mason and Kearns,
2013). Furthermore, a frequent limitation of research exam-
ining the relationship between physical activity and mental
wellbeing is the abundance of small sample size investiga-
tions (Penedo and Dahn, 2005). While a plethora of research
has examined the relationship between physical activity
and mental wellbeing (cf. Biddle and Asare, 2011; Fox,
1999; Penedo and Dahn, 2005), the influence of commu-
nity-wide gamification-based physical activity interven-
tions on mental wellbeing is yet to be explored and with
growing concerns of large geographical variations in men-
tal wellbeing at a population level (Arora et al., 2016), the
potential of this approach warrants further exploration.
The current study
The purpose of the current study was to explore the rela-
tionship between physical activity and mental wellbeing by
focussing primarily on those who are inactive. The study
sought to examine the cross-sectional relationship between
physical inactivity and mental wellbeing from a large rep-
resentative sample size, to explore the impact of a commu-
nity-wide gamification-based physical activity intervention
on mental wellbeing and to examine changes in mental
wellbeing in relation to changes in physical activity before
and after a community-wide intervention.
Methodology
Intervention
`Beat the Street' aims to increase physical activity using
gamification components. Battery powered radio-fre-
quency identification (RFID) scanners called `Beat Boxes'
are located at half mile intervals throughout a town/city and
residents receive 10 points each time two consecutive `Beat
Boxes' are touched with a RFID card within 1
hour.
Residents compete to see which schools, community groups
and individuals can achieve the greatest physical activity
over the course of the game period and highest scorers are
rewarded with prizes. For example, vouchers for sports
equipment are provided to schools, community groups are
rewarded with active lifestyle prizes (such as bicycles),
`lucky tap' prizes offer instant gratification and there is an
overall prize for total miles travelled where money is
donated to a local charity. A 7-month period follows the
6-week competition and involves trained individuals sup-
porting residents into long-term behaviour change by
directing them into suitable physical activity opportunities
for their age, competency level and demographic, while
also working with the local authority to develop and intro-
duce bespoke physical activities if a gap in provision is
identified. For the purposes of the current study, a total of
20 Beat Boxes were situated throughout Stranraer, Scotland,
which collectively received 3371 unique users (38% of the
target population) completing a total of 285,380 scans. A
detailed overview of the intervention has been provided
elsewhere (see Coombes and Jones, 2016).
Participants
Prior to the intervention, residents of Stranraer, Scotland,
were encouraged to register their RFID card online which
enabled their accumulated points to be allocated to a team
(school/community group). In total, n=1686 people com-
pleted the primary outcome measure (mental wellbeing)
in full at baseline, a response rate of 72.9
per cent and
n=167 people provided follow-up data immediately fol-
lowing the intervention. Sample characteristics are pro-
vided in Table 1.

Outcome measures
Participant's physical activity levels were measured using
the Scottish Physical Activity Screening Questionnaire
(Scot-PASQ) (Physical Activity and Health Alliance, 2012).
The Scot-PASQ is a three-item measure of physical activity
behaviour and attitude, although the current study only oper-
ationalised the first questionnaire element, which delineates
number of days spent completing 30
minutes or more of
moderate intensity physical activity in the previous week, to
provide a non-subjective categorical measure of physical
activity. Mental wellbeing was measured using the
WEMWBS (Tennant et al., 2007).The long-formWEMWBS
is a 14-item scale with five response categories, ranging from
`None of the Time'to `All of the Time', with scores summed
to provide a single score of between 14 and 70. The
WEMWBS has been shown to demonstrate high levels of
internal consistency, reliability and construct validity
(Cronbach's =0.91; test­retest reliability r=0.83, goodness
of fit index (GFI)
=
0.91 and adjusted goodness of fit index
(AGFI)
=
0.87) (Tennant et al., 2007). Previous population
level data in Scotland have interpreted `good'mental wellbe-
ing as a WEMWBS score of over one standard deviation
above the mean of 51.05, `average' mental wellbeing as a
WEMWBS score of within one standard deviation of the
mean and `poor' mental wellbeing as a WEMWBS score of
more than one standard deviation below the mean (see
Braunholtz et al., 2007). The items are all worded positively
and cover both feeling and functioning aspects of mental
wellbeing (Braunholtz et al., 2007). Examples of questions
included in the scale are `I've been feeling optimistic about
the Future'and `I've been feeling close to other People'. The
WEMWBS is widely regarded as a valid and reliable tool for
measuring mental wellbeing in diverse populations (Stewart-
Brown, 2013).
Overview of analyses
Baseline data were subjected to a one-way between sub-
ject's analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test differences in
mental wellbeing across self-reported days of physical
activity, and a Spearman's rank-order correlation was used
to examine the relationship between physical activity and
mental wellbeing. Separate within subject's ANOVAs were
used to test for differences in physical activity and mental
wellbeing between baseline and follow-up. Finally, a
Pearson's product moment correlation was run to examine
the relationship between changes in mental wellbeing and
changes in physical activity between baseline and
follow-up.
Procedure
Prior to the competition, residents were given a RFID card
distributed via schools, council facilities, libraries, leisure
centres, general practice clinics and promotional events. To
participate in the competition, residents were required to
activate their RFID card via an online portal. During regis-
tration, participants were invited to complete a number of
optional and mandatory questions, including a range of
sociodemographic questions, a validated physical activity
questionnaire, a retrospective 1-week travel survey and a
validated self-report measure of mental wellbeing.
Immediately following the end of the 6-week competition,
all registered participants who agreed to be contacted and
did not unsubscribe from being contacted during the com-
petition period (72.5%) were sent a link to a follow-up sur-
vey via email. A £50 prize draw was offered to incentivise
follow-up survey completion and a total of four reminders
were sent to participants.
Results
Complete responses on mental wellbeing and physical
activity at baseline were collected from n=1686 people,
with varying levels of self-reported physical activity (see
Figure 1).
Cross-sectional analysis
Data were subjected to a one-way between subject's
ANOVA, with a between factor of self-reported days of
physical activity. Results showed a significant main effect
of self-reported days of physical activity on mental wellbe-
ing (F(7, 1678)=45.948, p<0.001, partial 2=0.161).
Pairwise comparisons showed that mental wellbeing
was significantly lower for participants reporting 0days of
physical activity compared with those who reported all
other levels of activity (p<0.001). A Spearman's rank-
order correlation was run to determine the relationship
between physical activity and mental wellbeing. There was
a weak, positive correlation between physical activity and
mental wellbeing, which was statistically significant
(rs(1684)=.316, p<0.001).
Pretest/posttest analysis
Complete pretest/posttest responses on mental wellbeing
were available for n
=
167 people, with varying levels of
baseline physical activity. Data were subjected to separate
one-way within subject's ANOVAs and a Pearson's product
moment correlation was used to examine the relationship
between changes in physical activity and changes in mental
wellbeing.
Changes in physical activity
There was a statistically significant increase in physical
activity from baseline to follow-up, whereby average days
of physical activity increased from 4.59 to 5.39days (F(1,
166)=16.786, p<0.001, partial 2=0.92). There was a
Harris 5
significant main effect of self-reported days of physical
activity at baseline on change in physical activity between
baseline and follow-up (F(7, 159)=25.046, p<0.001, par-
tial 2
=
0.524). Pairwise comparison showed that differ-
ence in physical activity between baseline and follow-up
was significantly greater for participants who reported
0
days of physical activity compared to all other groups
(p<0.001) (see Figure 2).
Changes in mental wellbeing
There was a statistically significant increase in mental well-
being from baseline to follow-up, whereby average mental
wellbeing score increased from 51.05 to 53.28 (F(1,
166)=5.332, p<0.05, partial 2=0.031). There was a sig-
nificant main effect of self-reported days of physical activ-
ity at baseline on change in mental wellbeing between
baseline and follow-up (F(7, 159)=10.345, p<0.001, par-
tial 2
=
0.313). Pairwise comparison showed that the dif-
ference in mental wellbeing between baseline and follow-up
was significantly greater participants who reported 0
days
of physical activity when compared to all other groups
(p<0.001) (see Figure 3).
Physical activity mental wellbeing relationship
A Pearson's product moment correlation was run to deter-
mine the relationship between changes in physical activity
and changes in mental wellbeing. There was a strong, posi-
tive correlation between physical activity and mental well-
being, which was statistically significant (r(167)=0.513,
p<0.0001).
Discussion
The aim of the current study was to examine the relationship
between physical activity and mental wellbeing by focussing
primarily on the inactive. This investigation explored the
relationship between physical inactivity and mental wellbe-
ing using baseline data from a large representative sample
size and studied the influence of a community-wide physical
activity intervention on mental wellbeing. The analysis
revealed a substantial and statistically significant difference
between participants who reported 0days of physical activity
in the previous week, compared to those who reported all
other activity levels. There was a statistically significant
increase in mental wellbeing from baseline (pre-interven-
tion) to follow-up (post-intervention). Furthermore, the
increase in mental wellbeing was significantly greater for
those reported 0
days of physical activity pre-intervention
when compared to all other activity groups. Additionally, a
positive correlation was found between change in physical
activity and change in mental wellbeing from baseline to
follow-up.
The current study provides three novel contributions to
the current evidence base for the relationship between phys-
ical activity and mental wellbeing. First, the community-
wide, gamification-based physical activity intervention
examined here was found to increase mental wellbeing.
Second, increase in physical activity following the interven-
tion was positively correlated with mental wellbeing; how-
ever, no causal direction can be established.Third, increasing
physical activity levels for those who reported 0
days of
activity pre-intervention was associated with a substantially
greater increase in mental wellbeing than was observed for
all other groups. These findings provide support for the use
of community-wide interventions for increasing levels of
mental wellbeing at a community level and suggest that
such approaches may be particularly effective for raising

levels of mental wellbeing by those with significantly lower
levels of this psychological asset; the physically inactive.
The well-established link between social cohesion and
mental wellbeing offers a potential avenue which may
explain the findings of the current study. Previous research
has provided strong evidence for the potential of social
cohesion for enhancing individual wellbeing (Kawachi and
Berkman, 2001). Social relationships influence health hab-
its, provide social support, can mitigate stress, can eluci-
date a sense of purpose and alter physiological responses to
harm and distress (Cohen, 2004; Crosnoe and Elder, 2004;
Glynn et al., 1999; Kawachi and Berkman, 2001; Thoits,
1995; Uchino, 2004; Umberson et al., 2010). Research
directly examining the relationship between social cohe-
sion and mental health has found high social cohesion sig-
nificantly modified the association between income
deprivation and mental health (Fone et al., 2007); however,
no causal direction could be established due to the cross-
sectional design of this study; an alternative explanation
could be that communities with individuals possessing
greater mental health could be more socially connected.
A hypothesis which stems from these findings is that
social cohesion may mediate the relationship between physi-
cal activity and mental wellbeing, with increased levels of
social cohesion elucidating a subsequent increase in mental
wellbeing, or vice versa. The Beat the Street intervention
which occupied the focus of the current study provided
numerous components which may have increased levels of
social cohesion. First, the intervention operates at a commu-
nity-wide level and is branded to the local environment, in
this instance, Stranraer, which may have functioned to con-
nect people to their local area. Second, the programme relies
on the competitive nature of teams (whether school or com-
munity group based) which could have functioned to
strengthen existing social networks or enable individuals
without connection to an existing social group to become a
part of one (for instance, their child's school, their workplace
or a local charity). Finally, the intervention offered 20 local
points of common interest, the `Beat Boxes', and a common
topic of conversation, the `game'. With 3371 (38% of the
population within the game boundary) recording 285,380
scans on just 20 Beat Boxes, it is highly likely that paths
would have crossed on numerous occasions with familiar
and unfamiliar neighbours and the game itself would have
offered a convenient topic of discussion, such as what team
people are a part of, how many points they have acquired and
how many miles they have travelled. However, due to the
novelty of both the intervention and the theory of behaviour
change, gamification, these hypotheses are speculative rather
than scientific and warrant further investigation.
Study limitations
There was a high drop-out rate for the second element of
the study which examined changes in physical activity
and mental wellbeing over time; it could be that those who
remained in the study could have been a unique popula-
tion compared to those who did not provide post-interven-
tion data. Furthermore, women were more likely to engage
in the intervention, provide baseline data and provide
follow-up data post-intervention; therefore, the findings
of the current study could be gender specific. This study
also relied wholly upon self-reported measures of both
physical activity and mental wellbeing, and therefore, the
honesty by which participants disclose such information
is questionable. However, the study utilised measurement
instruments which have been validated and used exten-
sively at population level across the country of origin of
the sample.
Future directions
The Beat the Street intervention which formed the focus
of the current study offers a novel way to promote physi-
cal activity and other wider psychosocial benefits, such
as individual mental wellbeing and community cohe-
sion. However, due the novelty of the intervention and
its underlying theoretical basis, gamification, little is
known about the precise mechanisms which support (un)
successful implementation. As noted above, three poten-
tial, unique components are provided which may explain
the findings of the current study; however, these are
highly speculative. More research is needed which
explores these elements in greater detail and such future
contributions may be more suited to qualitative
methodology.
Conclusion
This study provides further support for the relationship
between physical activity and mental wellbeing and high-
lights the substantial differences in mental wellbeing
between the least and most active individuals. The findings
presented above provide preliminary evidence for the
potential role of community-wide, gamification-based
physical activity interventions in addressing mental health
inequalities. Future research should explore the potential
mechanisms which underpin the relationship between
physical activity and mental wellbeing and seek to identify
the extent to which social or psychological factors best
explain this association.
