OBJECTIVE -- To examine the separate and combined effects of depression and diabetes on
the incidence of adverse health outcomes among older Mexican Americans.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Longitudinal data from the Hispanic Estab-
lished Population for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (EPESE) survey were used to
examine the main effects and interaction effects of diabetes and depressive symptoms (measured
with the Center for Epidemiologic Study of Depression) or clinical diagnostic criteria (measured
with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Depression Module) on the development
of macrovascular complications (including cardiovascular disease, stroke, and kidney disease),
microvascular complications (including nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and amputa-
tions), functional disability, and mortality over 7 years in a sample of 2,830 Mexican Americans
aged 65 years.
RESULTS -- The interaction of diabetes and depression was found to be synergistic, predict-
ing greater mortality, greater incidence of both macro- and microvascular complications, and
greater incidence of disability in activities of daily living, even when controlling for sociodemo-
graphic characteristics such as sex, age, education, acculturation, and marital status. Impor-
tantly, this interaction was found to predict not only greater incidence but also earlier incidence
of adverse events in older adults.
CONCLUSIONS -- Whether a marker for underlying disease severity, an indicator of di-
minished self-care motivation, or the result of physiologic changes, the interaction of depression
and diabetes has a synergistic effect on the health of older Mexican Americans, increasing the risk
for poor outcomes. This is of particular clinical importance because although depression is often
underrecognized in older adults, effective treatment is available and can result in improved
medical outcomes.
Diabetes Care 26:2822­2828, 2003
Depression, long recognized as a con-
sequence of physical illness (1), is
increasingly being perceived as a
potential risk factor for compromised
health, particularly among older adults
(2). A number of recent studies have
shown that depression predicts the onset
of many medical conditions, including
hypertension, heart disease, cancer,
stroke, and angina, as well as type 2 dia-
betes (3­7).
Several studies have also shown de-
pression as a predictor of mortality (8) as
well as the onset of disability (9). Indeed,
it has been projected that by 2020, de-
pression will be the second leading cause
of disability worldwide (10). Depression
has also been shown to impact adherence
to treatment regimens and the cost of
health care among individuals with
chronic disease (11), including diabetes
(12). Despite this evidence, few studies
have examined the influence of depres-
sion on the course of chronic disease, par-
ticularly in large samples of older adults
living in the community.
In earlier studies from the Hispanic
Established Population for the Epidemio-
logic Study of the Elderly (EPESE) survey,
we demonstrated that depressive symp-
toms were associated with a number of
poor health indicators among older dia-
betic Mexican Americans, including
elevated rates of comorbid medical con-
ditions, greater functional disability, and
increased health care utilization (2,13).
Moreover, death rates among individuals
with both diabetes and depression were
found to be three times higher than rates
among diabetic individuals without de-
pression (2). Little is known, however, re-
garding the impact of depression on other
adverse health outcomes in diabetes, such
as increasing disease severity, disability,
and comorbidity of disease.
In the present study, longitudinal
data from the Hispanic EPESE survey
were used to assess the separate and com-
bined influences of depression and diabe-
tes on the incidence of macrovascular and
microvascular complications, functional
disability, and mortality among older
Mexican Americans. This is a particularly
appropriate population in which to exam-
ine this relationship because older Mexi-
can Americans experience elevated rates
of both diabetes and depression: 25­30%

of these individuals report significant lev-

RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS
Sample
The baseline interview of the Hispanic
EPESE was conducted from 1993 to 1994
in Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Ari-
zona, and California, the region in which
most older Mexican Americans reside.
Area probability sampling resulted in a
representative sample of 3,050 communi-
ty-dwelling Mexican Americans aged
65 years who completed in-home face-
to-face interviews in either Spanish or En-
glish. The baseline sample was designed
to be representative of the 500,000
Mexican Americans aged 65 years re-
siding in the southwestern U.S. The initial
baseline wave of interviews was followed
by three waves of follow-up: the first was
conducted from 1995 to 1996, the second
was conducted from 1998 to 1999, and
the third wave of follow-up was con-
ducted from 2000 to 2001.
Depressive symptoms were assessed
at baseline. Individuals who were too ill
or cognitively impaired to complete face-
to-face interviews at baseline were not in-
cluded in the present analyses, which
resulted in 2,830 individuals with com-
plete data for analyses predicting mortal-
ity. Analyses predicting incident diabetic
complications or disability reflect only the
reports of the 2,462 individuals who were
not deceased by the first follow-up. Clin-
ical diagnostic criteria for depression
were assessed at the first wave of fol-
low-up and yielded a total of 2,092 indi-
viduals with complete data for analyses
predicting mortality, incident complica-
tions, and disability.
As can be seen in Table 1, older
women comprised 59% of the sample.
Just over two-thirds of the participants
were aged 65­74 years and 10% had
completed high school. Just over half of
the participants in the sample were cur-
rently married; older men were much
more likely to have been married than
older women (2  308.2, P  0.0001).
Measures
Diabetes and diabetic complications.
At baseline and both follow-up inter-
views, the presence of diabetes was as-
sessed by asking the respondents whether
they had ever been told by a physician
that they had diabetes. All individuals
who responded affirmatively were then
asked whether they had type 1 or type 2
diabetes; all respondents indicated that
they had been diagnosed with type 2 dia-
betes. Individuals reporting impaired glu-
cose tolerance were not designated as
having diabetes in the present analyses.
Respondents were also asked whether
they had experienced any kidney prob-
lems (nephropathy), eye problems (reti-
nopathy), circulation or nerve problems
(neuropathy), or amputations as a result
of having diabetes. Respondents were
then categorized as having any incident
microvascular complications at each wave
of follow-up if they reported any compli-
cations that were not present at baseline.
At baseline and all three waves of fol-
low-up interviews, respondents were
asked whether they had ever received a
physician's diagnosis of other medical
conditions that are often sequelae of dia-
betes, including cardiovascular disease,
stroke, and kidney disease. Respondents
were categorized as having incident mac-
rovascular complications at each wave of
follow-up if they reported any conditions
that were not reported at baseline.
Functional disability. Disability in ac-
tivities of daily living was measured with a
modified version of the Katz Activities of
Daily Living scale (15), which included
walking across a small room, bathing,
grooming, dressing, eating, transferring
from a bed to a chair, and using the toilet.
Respondents were categorized as having
incident disability at each wave of fol-
low-up if they reported any difficulties
with activities of daily living that were not
reported at baseline.
Sociodemographic characteristics in-
cluded the sex, age, years of education,
level of acculturation, and marital status
at baseline. Vital status (mortality) was as-
sessed at each follow-up interview. The

actual date of death was then ascertained
by reviewing death certificates.
Depression was measured in two
ways in this study. Depressive symptoms
were measured at baseline with the Cen-
ter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
Scale (CESD) (16), the most commonly
used survey measure of depressive symp-
tomatology in studies of older adults.
Found to be reliable and valid when used
in elderly individuals, the scale consists of
20 items that ask how often specific
symptoms were experienced during the
week preceding the interview, and re-
sponses are scored on a four-point scale,
with potential total scores ranging from 0
to 60. These scores were used to delineate
three categories of respondents: those
with minor depression (based on a CESD
score of 16), those with minimal de-
pression (CESD scores of 1­15, often re-
ferred to as subthreshold depressive
syndrome), and those without any de-
pressive symptoms (CESD score of 0).
The cutoff for minor depression, although
not indicative of a diagnosis of clinical de-
pression, has previously been shown to
effectively identify individuals with clini-
cally significant levels of depressive symp-
toms in other studies of older adults (17)
as well as with this sample of older Mex-
ican Americans (2).
Depressive diagnoses were assessed at
the second wave (first follow-up inter-
view) with a modified version of the de-
pression module of the Composite
International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)
(18), which matches the criteria for de-
pressive disorders as delineated in the Di-
agnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth
Edition (DSM-IV) of the American Psy-
chiatric Association (19). Developed by
the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental
Health Administration and the World
Health Organization, the CIDI was de-
signed specifically for large-scale psychi-
atric epidemiologic research with
populations from diverse cultures and ed-
ucation levels. Earlier versions of these
criteria have been extensively used to
yield valid and reliable diagnoses of de-
pressive disorders in survey research, in-
cluding surveys of the elderly. The
Hispanic EPESE specifically used the de-
pression module from the Fresno CIDI
(20), which was culturally and linguisti-
cally adapted for Mexican Americans.
In the present study, depressive diag-
noses included reporting of any lifetime
major depressive episode (requiring an
affirmative response to five of nine de-
pressive symptoms experienced in a
2-week period, at least one of which was
depressed mood or anhedonia) or lifetime
dysthymia (requiring an affirmative re-
sponse to three depressive symptoms that
lasted 2 years, without absence of
symptoms for at least 2 months, at least
one of which was depressed mood,
among individuals not concomitantly
meeting the criteria for major depression)
(19). Individuals who reported that
symptoms were in response to bereave-
ment of no more than 2 months' duration
were not included in the depressed
group.
Two sets of diabetic/depressive
classes were derived. The depressive
symptom classes included six categories:
1) respondents with no diabetes and a to-
tal absence of any depressive symptoms
(CESD score of 0), 2) respondents with no
diabetes and with only minimal levels of
depressive symptoms (CESD scores of
16), 3) respondents with minor depres-
sion (CESD scores of 16) but no diabe-
tes, 4) respondents with diabetes but with
a total absence of any depressive symp-
toms (CESD score of 0), 5) respondents
with diabetes and minimal depression
(CESD scores of 1­15), and 6) respon-
dents with diabetes and minor depression
(CESD scores of 16). The depressive di-
agnosis classes included four categories:
1) respondents with no diabetes or life-
time depressive diagnoses, 2) respon-
dents with lifetime depressive diagnoses
but no diabetes, 3) respondents with dia-
betes but no lifetime depressive diag-
noses, and 4) respondents with diabetes
and lifetime depressive diagnoses.
Analyses
The rates of incident macrovascular and
incident microvascular complications, in-
cident disability, and mortality over the 7
years of study were assessed across socio-
demographics, diabetic status, minor de-
pression alone, lifetime depression alone,
and across each of the two sets of diabetic/
depressive classes. Cumulative rates were
derived at each follow-up wave and dif-
ferences were assessed with 2 analyses.
Initial logistic regression models were
used to assess the main effects and inter-
action effects of diabetes and depression.
Interaction effects were assessed by enter-
ing a second-order term for depression
and diabetes into the main effects model
(21). Survival analysis was then used to
estimate the hazard ratios and survival
function estimates associated with the di-
abetic/depressive classes, while control-
ling for sociodemographic characteristics
(22). The PHREG procedure for Cox pro-
portional hazards regression in the SAS
statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC) was used to estimate these functions.
This procedure was particularly appro-
priate because it easily accommodates
both discrete (for incident complications
and disability) and continuous (for mor-
tality) measurement of event times and
allows testing of time dependency, that is,
whether the event occurs earlier or later in
association with an independent variable.
All analyses were adjusted for design ef-
fects using SUDAAN statistical software
(SAS Institute) (23).
RESULTS
Prevalence of diabetes and
depression
Almost 23% of individuals in the sample
group reported a physician's diagnosis of
type 2 diabetes; no variation by sex was
noted (Table 1). Approximately 24% of
subjects reported minor depression; how-
ever, older women reported a substan-
tially higher rate (28.6%) than older men
(17.4%). Approximately 9.0% met crite-
ria for any lifetime diagnosis of major de-
pressive episode or dysthymia; however,
the rate among older women (11.5%) was
more than twice that of older men (5.3%).
Categorizing by depressive symptoms,
13% of subjects had neither diabetes nor
any depressive symptom, 47% had diabe-
tes with only minimal depressive symp-
toms, 17.3% had minor depression but
no diabetes, 2.8% had diabetes without
any depressive symptoms, 13.1% had di-
abetes with minimal depression, and
6.6% had both diabetes and minor de-
pression. Categorizing by lifetime depres-
sive diagnoses, 71.8% of the sample had
neither diabetes nor lifetime depression,
6.5% had lifetime depression but no dia-
betes, 19.2% had diabetes but no lifetime
depression, and 2.5% had both diabetes
and lifetime depression.
Rates of adverse outcomes
By the final wave of follow-up, 35% of
individuals in the sample group had ma-
crovascular complications that were not
present at baseline, 14% had new mi-
crovascular complications, 24% had inci-
dent disability, and 28% had died. At all

three waves of follow-up, the older men
were less likely to have incident disability
but more likely to have died than the
older women. Individuals who were aged
75 years at baseline were more likely to
have incident disability and to have died
at all three waves of follow-up. Respon-
dents with 12 years of formal education
were less likely to have developed macro-
vascular complications and disability and
were less likely to have died at all three
waves of follow-up. Those who were mar-
ried at baseline were less likely to have
developed disability and less likely to
have died at all three waves of follow-up.
Individuals with diabetes or minor de-
pression at baseline, as well as those who
met criteria for any lifetime diagnosis of
depressive disorders had much higher
rates of all four adverse events at all three
waves of follow-up (lifetime depressive
disorders were measured at the first fol-
low-up and, therefore, could predict
death only at the final two waves of fol-
low-up).
Among the diabetic/depressive symp-
tom classes, respondents with both di-
abetes and minor depression had
dramatically higher rates of all four ad-
verse events. For example, by the final
wave of follow-up, 44% of subjects with
both conditions had macrovascular com-
plications, compared with only 30% who
had neither condition. Similar rate differ-
ences were apparent for microvascular
complications (43% with both conditions
versus 36% with only diabetes and only
3% with neither condition), disability
(38% with both conditions versus 14%
with neither condition), and mortality
(45% with both conditions versus 17%
with neither condition). The rates for sub-
jects with only diabetes and those with
only minor depression were comparable
across adverse events, with the exception
that those with only diabetes were more
likely than those with only minor depres-
sion to develop microvascular complica-
tions by any of the waves of follow-up.
Importantly, subjects who had diabe-
tes but no depressive symptoms whatso-
ever (CESD score of 0) were at much
lower risk for all adverse outcomes than
those with both conditions and at compa-
rable risk to individuals with only minor
depression (again, with the exception of
microvascular complications).
Similar results were found among the
diabetic/depressive diagnosis classes: re-
spondents with both diabetes and any
lifetime depressive disorders also had dra-
matically higher rates of all four adverse
events. For example, by the final wave of
follow-up, 64% of subjects with both con-
ditions had macrovascular complications
compared with only 38% of those with
neither condition. Approximately 52% of
those with both conditions developed mi-
crovascular complications versus 42% of
those with only diabetes and 7% of those
with neither condition. Incident disability
occurred in 52% of subjects with both
conditions versus 23% of those with nei-
ther condition, and 56% of those with
both conditions died by the final wave of
follow-up compared with only 18% of
those with neither condition. Respon-
dents with neither diabetes nor any life-
time depressive disorder had the lowest
rates of all four adverse events, and the
rates for those with only diabetes and
those with only lifetime depression were
comparable across all adverse events,
again with the exception that those with
only diabetes were more likely than those
with only depression to develop diabetic
complications.
Multivariate findings
The elevated risk associated with the in-
teraction of diabetes and depression was
even more apparent in the results of the
multivariate analyses. Results of prelimi-
nary logistic regression models (not
shown in the tables) predicting the inci-
dence of all four adverse outcomes indi-
cated that both diabetes and the two
measures of depression had significant
main effects, with the exception that nei-
ther measure of depression predicted the
incidence of microvascular complica-
tions. More importantly, however, the ef-
fects of the interaction between diabetes
and depression were striking. First, the
effects of the interaction seemed to be
synergistic (that is, greater than the addi-
tive main effects of diabetes and depres-
sion). For example, regarding mortality,
the risk associated with the interaction
between diabetes and depression (odds
ratio [OR] 4.04, 95% CI 2.70­6.02) was
greater than the additive main effects of
diabetes (1.32, 1.02­1.71) and any life-
time depressive diagnosis (1.29, 1.01­
1.69; additive effects for these main
effects would be 1.32  1.29 or 1.70).
Similarly, regarding incident disability,
the risk associated with the interaction
(4.11, 2.72­6.23) was greater than the
additive main effects of diabetes (1.74,
1.26­2.63) and minor depression mea-
sured with depressive symptoms (1.27,
1.02­1.81; additive effects for these main
effects would be 1.74  1.27 or 2.21).
Second, these initial results also indi-
cated that the interaction effects were
more substantial earlier than later during
the follow-up period. For example, the
risk for microvascular complications as-
sociated with the interaction between di-
abetes and any lifetime depressive
disorder was considerably higher at the
second follow-up (6.58, 4.16­10.39)
than at the third follow-up (5.13, 3.32­
7.95). Similarly, the risk for mortality as-
sociated with the interaction between
diabetes and minor depression declined
from the first follow-up (5.43, 3.52­
8.38) to the second follow-up (3.72,
2.65­5.23) to the third follow-up (3.30,
2.39­4.51). Based on these findings, a
series of survival analyses were conducted
for each of the four adverse outcomes.
Macrovascular complications. Table 2
shows the hazard ratio (HR) for each of
the four adverse events associated with
the combined risk factors over the 7 years
of follow-up, controlling for the influence
of sociodemographic characteristics.
These results were derived from a set of
survival analyses subsequent to the pre-
liminary logistic regression models. As
can be seen in Table 2, older Mexican
Americans with both diabetes and minor
depression had not only a significantly
higher risk of comorbid disease than
those with neither condition (HR 2.40,
95% CI 1.71­3.36) but also a higher risk
than respondents with only minor de-
pression (1.33, 1.14­1.70) or those with
diabetes and minimal depression (1.56,
1.21­2.00). Importantly, those who had
diabetes but no depressive symptoms
whatsoever (CESD score of 0) were at
much the same risk (1.35, 1.06­2.27) as
individuals with only minor depression,
lower than the risk even for those with
diabetes and minimal depression. Impor-
tantly, these findings illustrate a gradient
of risk from diabetic individuals with no
depressive symptoms to those with mini-
mal depression to those with minor de-
pression. Similar results were found for
incident microvascular complications, in-
cident disability, and mortality (Table 2).
The risks associated with the diabetic/
depressive diagnosis classes are also
shown in Table 2. Respondents with both
diabetes and any lifetime depressive diag-
noses had a significantly higher risk of
Black, Markides, and Ray
DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 26, NUMBER 10, OCTOBER 2003 2825
disability than those with neither condi-
tion (3.94, 2.31­6.73). Those with both
conditions also had a higher risk than re-
spondents with only depressive diagnoses
(1.38, 1.02­1.90) or only diabetes (1.84,
1.51­2.24). Again, similar results were
evident for incident macrovascular com-
plications, incident microvascular com-
plications, and mortality.
Importantly, the results from testing
for time dependency in regards to having
both depression and diabetes (Table 2)
indicate that the comorbidity of the two
conditions was predictive not only of
greater risk but also of earlier risk of all
adverse outcomes, with the exception of
macrovascular complications. This find-
ing was evident for both the comorbidity
of diabetes and minor depression and the
comorbidity of diabetes and lifetime de-
pressive disorder.
Because the nature and course of ma-
jor depression and dysthymia vary con-
siderably, analyses were also conducted
that compared the hazards associated
with diabetes comorbid with lifetime ma-
jor depression versus diabetes comorbid
with lifetime dysthymia. Although not
shown, these results indicated no sub-
stantial differences in the risk associated
with either depressive disorder, with the
exception that lifetime dysthymia was a
somewhat stronger predictor of mortality
than lifetime major depression.
CONCLUSIONS -- Our findings
provide compelling evidence that the in-
teraction between diabetes and depres-
sion, whether measured by clinical
diagnostic criteria or by self-reported de-
pressive symptoms, has a synergistic ef-
fect on adverse health outcomes in older
Mexican Americans. We provide evi-
dence for a gradient response such that
the risk of adverse outcomes increases
with the increasing severity of depression
present with diabetes. Importantly, we
also found that the interaction between
diabetes and depression predicts not only
increased mortality, complications, and
disability but also earlier occurrence of all
of these adverse outcomes, with the ex-
ception of macrovascular complications.
Speculation regarding the pathways
by which depression impacts diabetes
falls into two broad categories: psychobe-
havioral and pathophysiological. Depres-
sion may influence diabetes through
decreased motivation to maintain behav-
iors that will protect against the develop-
ment or worsening of diabetes, such as
proper weight, diet, and exercise (24).
The increased risk of negative diabetic
outcomes may also be the result of bio-
logic changes that occur as a result of de-
pression, including neurohormonal or
neurotransmitter abnormalities (25), or
lowered immune functioning, or inhib-
ited cortisol release, which in turn in-
crease vulnerability to diabetes (26,27). It
may also be possible that both depression
and diabetes share common pathogene-
sis, such as actions of the autonomic or
sympathetic nervous systems (28,29),
polymorphism of genes associated with
obesity, insulin resistance, and sensitivity
to stress (30), reduction of glucose use
and increased insulin resistance (31),
common neuroendocrine pathways (32),
or the disruption of the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal axis (33). The link be-
tween depression and diabetes may also
be the direct or indirect result of risk fac-
tors common to both conditions, such as
obesity, inactivity, medication use, and
other preexisting psychological and phys-
ical conditions (34).
Importantly, psychobehavioral and
pathophysiological mechanisms may act
independently or in conjunction. There

Depression predicts adverse outcomes in diabetes

may also be differences in the timing of
actions of psychobehavioral versus patho-
physiological mechanisms. A recent study
by Peyrot and Rubin (24) suggests that
the influence of factors such as stress and
social support may engage in response to
life circumstances, whereas factors such
as disease severity, blood glucose, and
other biologic measures may be more
consistent, long-term influences.
It should be noted that this study has
several limitations. First, diabetes was
measured by self-reported physician di-
agnosis because no measure of fasting
blood glucose was available in the study.
Self-reports of chronic conditions, how-
ever, have been widely used in popula-
tion-based surveys and have proven to be
highly reliable, including self-reports of
diabetes (35). Second, although the meth-
ods used to assess depression are standard
and well validated for use in epidemio-
logic studies, there is no absolute cer-
tainty regarding diagnosis. In addition,
the assessment for lifetime depressive dis-
order did not occur until the first fol-
low-up interview. The fact that similar
results were found for both clinical diag-
nostic criteria and high levels of depres-
sive symptoms and the evidence of a
gradient in severity of depression, how-
ever, suggest that our findings are robust
and generalizable. In addition, we could
not account for the transition between de-
pressive states over time. Depression can
occur once for a short time period, con-
sistently over a long time period, or can
come and go repeatedly over the course of
time. Future work will need to incorpo-
rate these transitions. Finally, the present
study was limited to older Mexican Amer-
icans with type 2 diabetes. It is not clear
whether the interaction between depres-
sion and diabetes is consistent across ra-
cial and ethnic groups, across age-groups,
or in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
This study is unique, however, in that
it is the first large, population-based study
to show that the interaction between de-
pression and diabetes has a synergistic ef-
fect on mortality and the development of
complications and disability. In other
words, the effects of concomitant depres-
sion and diabetes on negative health out-
comes are multiplicative, that is, greater
than simply the sum of the main effects of
each individual condition. Furthermore,
our results also show that the interaction
results in earlier occurrence of macrovas-
cular complications, microvascular com-
plications, disability, and mortality.
Our study findings hold particular
clinical importance because effective
treatment is available for both diabetes
and depression. Close case management
of diabetes that includes assessment and
treatment for depression has been shown
to be beneficial. Treatment for depression
in patients with diabetes can result in im-
proved medical outcomes, as well as im-
proved psychological well-being. Most
importantly, treatment for depression has
been found to be associated with im-
proved glycemic control (36). Treatment
for depression has also been found to re-
sult in weight reduction and improve-
ments in diabetic neuropathy (37).
Treatment for diabetes has been demon-
strated to reduce functional disability, al-
leviate psychological distress in depressed
individuals, and increase overall well-
being (38). As it has been amply demon-
strated that improved glycemic control
results in reductions of the microvascular
and macrovascular consequences of dia-
betes, including mortality (39) and reduc-
tion of diabetic symptoms (38), treatment
for depression that leads to improved gly-
cemic control is essential for depressed
diabetic adults.
