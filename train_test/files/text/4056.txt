Abstract
Objective: To investigate in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) to diagnose hidden corneal foreign
bodies.
Methods: Male Kunming mice (n ¼ 25; 12 weeks old) were anaesthetized prior to the insertion of
five different materials (spiny wood, rusty iron, sharp stone, sharp glass fragment and human hair
fragment) into the cornea by different traumatic processes. A separate mouse was used for each
corneal foreign body. The corneas of the mice were scanned 24 h later by a laser scanning IVCM to
establish the characteristics (shape, reflectivity and depth in the cornea) of each foreign body.
These findings were used to help screen and identify corneal foreign bodies in patients. Corneal
smears and scraping cultures were performed in cases of probable corneal infection.
Results: Animal models for the five different foreign particles were established successfully, with
each showing distinctive characteristics. These animal results were used to diagnose 41 patients
with suspected corneal foreign bodies who were negative by slit lamp examination, but positive by
IVCM (observational case series). The most prevalent type of hidden foreign body was plant
material (51.2%), followed by metal (29.3%). Ten patients with corneal foreign bodies developed
fungal keratitis, found using IVCM.
Conclusions: Laser IVCM is an effective and reliable tool for the diagnosis of hidden corneal
foreign bodies.

Introduction
Foreign particles in the cornea are common
occupational ocular injuries that are gener-
ally caused by pricking accidents or cutting
activities.1,2 Patients generally report a prior
trauma to the cornea that is accompanied by
severe pain. The majority of corneal foreign
bodies are metal scraps, plant fragments and
stone particles, all of which can be import-
ant vectors of corneal infection.3,4 Large
corneal foreign bodies are easily detected
with a slit lamp examination, but smaller
corneal foreign bodies or corneal foreign
bodies with infectious keratitis can be diffi-
cult to detect and diagnose by routine
examination, and are termed `hidden cor-
neal foreign bodies'. In vivo confocal micros-
copy (IVCM) combines fast scanning time
with high resolution, and has been used for
the in vivo study of the anatomic properties
of the cornea in normal and pathological
states, including morphological changes
after surgery.5­8
This study consisted of two parts. The
first was the characterization of common
corneal foreign bodies in a mouse model by
Heidelberg Retina Tomograph III (HRT
III) and Rostock Cornea Module (RCM)
IVCM. The same technology was then used
for patients presenting with hidden corneal
foreign bodies in an observation case series
to detect and identify the foreign bodies, and
to evaluate the role of laser scanning IVCM
in their diagnosis.
Materials and methods
Detection of corneal foreign bodies in mice
Twelve-week-old male Kunming mice
(n ¼ 25; weight 36­40 g; from the
Laboratory Animal Center of Zhengzhou
University, China) were used as a mouse
model to identify corneal foreign bodies.
The study protocol was approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Henan Eye Institute and all
mice were handled in accordance with the
Association for Research in Vision and
Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the
Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision
Research.
Mice were anaesthetized with an intra-
peritoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium
solution (50 mg/kg body weight). So that the
characteristics of the animal model should
be as close as possible to clinical cases, spiny
wood, rusty iron and sharp stones were used
to scuff the central cornea of the mice before
the foreign body was implanted using a
stereoscopic microscope (SteREO
Discovery V8, Carl Zeiss Meditec,
Oberkochen, Germany). The sharp glass
fragments were implanted directly in the
cornea, and the human hair fragment was
implanted after keratomy using a diamond
blade for refractive surgery. Five separate
mice were used for each corneal foreign
body. Each animal was evaluated by slit
lamp examination 24 h later and corneal
findings were recorded for analysis. The
investigator (Z. Xu) was responsible for the
implantation of material in the mice eyes,
and L. Wang and X. Yu were responsible for
the subsequent examination by slip lamp
and by IVCM, respectively.
Five different kinds of corneal foreign
body models were established and then
scanned by a Heidelberg HRT III­RCM
laser scanning IVCM (Heidelberg
Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany),
equipped with a 670 nm wavelength diode
laser. The IVCM was operated by a trained
professional investigator (X.Y.) using the
sequence scanning mode, which allowed
images to be repeatedly acquired at different
focus positions, enabling the construction of
a three-dimensional image.9­11 The scanned
images were recorded for analysis.

between January 2011 and January 2013
with a suspected corneal foreign body, based
upon their history and examination with a
slit lamp by at least one cornea specialist,
were enrolled in this study. Written
informed consent was obtained from each
patient in accordance with the tenets of the
Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol
was approved by The Ethics Committee of
Henan Eye Institute. Exclusion criteria
included younger patients who were unlikely
to be able to keep still for the HRT III­
RCM examination or those who were
unwilling to undergo this examination, and
patients with nystagmus, corneal perfor-
ation or active endophthalmitis.
Clinical examination of each patient
enrolled in this study included predisposing
risk factors, detailed history, slit lamp exam-
ination, clinical photography and examin-
ation with IVCM. Scanning was carried out
to identify different kinds of hidden corneal
foreign bodies: identification was based on
the characteristics of the corneal foreign
bodies in the animal model. Corneal smears
and scraping cultures were performed if the
patient was suspected of having a corneal
infection by a cornea specialist. The corneal
scrapings were viewed as wet mount prep-
arations using 10% potassium hydroxide
and Giemsa.12­14
Data analyses
The Statistical Package for Social Sciences
(SPSSÕ version 17.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL,
USA) was used for statistical analyses. Age
was expressed as mean Æ SD. The data were
evaluated using independent sample t-tests.
Scanning images were acquired and rec-
orded by Heidelberg Eye Version 1.5.10.0
(Heidelberg Engineering GmbH,
Heidelberg, Germany) and image analysis
was performed using Nikon NIS-Elements
Advanced Research version 3.2 (Nikon
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
Results
In this study, five different kinds of corneal
foreign body models were established suc-
cessfully in mice. Under IVCM, the different
foreign bodies in mice corneas were detected
and their appearance noted (Table 1 and
Figure 1).
In total, 537 patients were diagnosed with
corneal foreign bodies, based on their his-
tory and examination with a slit lamp.
A further 45 patients, who were negative
on slit lamp examination by a corneal
specialist (L. Wang), were then examined
with HRT III­RCM. The IVCM results
diagnosed 41 eyes of 41 patients with hidden
corneal foreign bodies; the remaining four
patients were still undiagnosed after
examination.
Of the 41 patients, 23 (56.1%) were men
and 18 (43.9%) were women, and an
approximately equal ratio of right and left
eyes were affected. The patients ranged in
age from 7 to 68 years (men: 42.58 Æ 18.63,
women: 34.25 Æ 14.52, P ¼ not significant,
independent samples t-test). When the pre-
disposing risk factors were analysed, a prior
incident of trauma to the cornea was
reported in 39 patients.

Based on the characteristics of the foreign
body under IVCM (Figure 2), 21 patients
(21/41, 51.2%) were diagnosed as having a
corneal foreign body of plant origin and
eight of these were complicated by concur-
rent corneal infection, 12 patients (29.3%)
had a metallic corneal foreign body, five
(12.2%) had stone, one (2.4%) had glass,
and one (2.4%) had an eyelash fragment.
Small parts from a bee sting (one patient,
2.4%) caused the remaining corneal lesion.
In the majority of cases, the metal corneal
foreign bodies were embedded more deeply
than the plant ones. These corneal foreign
bodies were removed by surgery and the
cornea lesions healed within several weeks.
The characteristics of the removed foreign
bodies were consisted with the IVCM
findings.
In this study, 10 patients were diagnosed
as having corneal foreign bodies and fungal
keratitis by IVCM. Although small corneal
infiltrations were detected in these
cases under a slit lamp, corneal foreign
bodies were not found. Smear microscopy
showed hyphae in only two patients, with
the other eight cases testing negative.
Bacterial infection was excluded by
Giemsa staining. Corneal foreign bodies
and bright hyphae were detected in the
corneal lesions of all 10 patients using
laser IVCM.

Discussion
In this study, 41 patients were diagnosed
with corneal foreign bodies by laser scan-
ning IVCM following inconclusive results
using a slit lamp. The slit lamp technique
may have failed to detect foreign bodies in
the cornea of these patients because of the
size and the shape of the corneal foreign
bodies (most likely when a plant corneal
foreign body is involved), infiltrative corneal
lesions or other opaque lesions, which can
cover the corneal foreign body, particularly
tiny ones, or the presence of corneal foreign
bodies associated with severe corneal
infections.
Although IVCM has been used for clin-
ical applications in ophthalmology for more
than 20 years, HRT III­RCM represents a
new generation of machine.15­18 In this
study, high resolution laser IVCM was
used to diagnose different kinds of concealed
corneal foreign bodies. Results showed that
glass corneal foreign bodies were more
highly reflective than other foreign bodies
and had a knife-edged appearance. The
reflection from metal corneal foreign
bodies was lower than that from glass
foreign bodies; the metal foreign bodies
had sharp edges and were shaped as
chunks or chippings.19,20 The most
common type of hidden corneal foreign
body was plant matter, which was seen as
spiny, exhibited a lower reflectivity than the
other foreign bodies described and had a

tendency to prick into the superficial cornea.
Plant foreign bodies are important vectors of
corneal contamination ­ the fungal keratitis
in eight patients was caused by plant foreign
bodies, which correlates with values found in
studies by Wang et al. and Xie et al.21,22
In one rare case, the patient was stung in
the cornea by a bee. When this occurs, the
venom and toxins from the bee sting are
injected into the cornea and can cause
pathological effects at the ocular surface,
including conjunctive hyperemia, corneal
edema and bullous keratopathy.23­25 The
retained sting should be removed carefully
by an ophthalmologist, and any home
remedies, such as a patient's partner using
a cotton bud to abrade the stinger, should be
avoided, as these may result in bee sting
segments within the cornea and continued
inflammation. Using the laser IVCM to scan
the lesions on the cornea in this case revealed
activated keratocytes, hydropic keratocytes,
inflammatory cells and highly reflective par-
ticles which may have been bee sting seg-
ments.26,27 Severe corneal bee stings can lead
to posterior eye complications, including iris
atrophy, cataract formation, optic neuritis
and papilloedema.28­30
The IVCM images of the corneal foreign
body models in the mouse model allowed
the identification and diagnosis of 41
patients with hidden corneal foreign
bodies. Removal of the foreign bodies
from the patients confirmed the confocal
findings ­ all hidden corneal foreign bodies
were consistent with the scan diagnosis.
The clinical symptoms and corneal
lesions in the four patients for whom a
corneal foreign body was not found by
either slit lamp examination or by IVCM
were assumed to be caused by other patho-
genic factors. Three patients were success-
fully treated with anti-inflammatory therapy
and the fourth was successfully treated with
antifungal agents.
In this study, IVCM led to better man-
agement of patients by identifying the
composition of the hidden corneal foreign
body. Plant and metal corneal foreign bodies
should be removed as early as possible to
avoid a serious inflammatory response or a
corneal infection; glass foreign bodies always
have a sharp edge and can easily penetrate
into the anterior chamber of the eye, and so
should also be removed as soon as possible.
In addition, IVCM can confirm whether a
corneal fungal infection is present, and can
provide the exact location and quantity of
corneal foreign bodies that need to be
removed. However, the number of animals
included in the mouse model in our study
was small, as was the number of patients:
animal models including a greater number of
mice should be established, and studies with
a greater number of patients should be
carried out to confirm our findings.
This study shows that IVCM plays an
effective and reliable role in the diagnosis of
hidden corneal foreign bodies. We recom-
mend that IVCM should be used in: patients
with a history of incident corneal trauma and
suspected corneal foreign body with slit lamp
examination; patients with an incident of
corneal trauma and nonhealing lesions des-
pite receiving intensive topical antimicroor-
ganism and anti-inflammatory therapy;
patients with corneal trauma, especially
plant trauma and clear corneal infiltrations;
patients undergoing surgical removal of
corneal foreign bodies but with a persistent
inflammatory reaction in the lesion. There
should be an increase in the role of IVCM in
diagnosing corneal foreign bodies.
