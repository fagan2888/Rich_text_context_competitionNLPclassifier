Article
As people adjust to mobile technologies as part of the normal
flow of society, those same people find new and innovative
methods of applying these technologies beyond mere one-to-
one communication or even one-to-many communication
(Ling & Campbell, 2011). Some people are applying the
channels of communication to become more of a self-docu-
menting mode. This self-documenting mode is comprised of
writing posts and comments and recording mediated content
for the purpose of recording the experiences and mundane
actions of everyday in a way that can be recalled or searched
via a public social feed. This feed of information represents
a kind of "public memory" for the individual who posted the
content.
For the purpose of this analysis, the term public memory
is simply shorthand for posting content onto a mediated plat-
form where one of the purposes of posting is to journal or
note information that has a personal significance. For exam-
ple, one could take pictures of their meals not because they
are showing the dinner to their friends but rather keeping a
recorded journal of their favorite meals to remember them
later. In this way, there is not necessarily an imagined audi-
ence that the individual is focusing their content toward, but
rather it is designed to be an online scrapbook.
The purpose of this work is to look at how mobile media
is changing the nature of the collection of memory via digital
artifacts created by the hybrid of services that represent the
social and hyper-local interactions. These interactions are
best exemplified through the use of the SoLoMo (social,
local, mobile) category of applications for mobile devices,
especially services such as FourSquare and Instagram
(Nelson, 2013). These services will be discussed within the
context of their impact on public memory, specifically how
they bridge the gap between the digital and the physical, the
gap between an artifact and a souvenir, and its ability to com-
bine the role of the tourist and the archiver. The remaining
parts of this article will define these terms and describe the
impact that the mobile media space has had on these
concepts.
Public Memory and Rhetoric
While this article can only provide a basic understanding of
memory as a theoretical concept, there are two elements that
can be focused on to help explore this connection between
the transmission of personal public memory via social net-
works and the binary nature of those creations as
described in the introduction of this work. Both of these the-
matic elements can be explored by looking at the rhetorical

Mobile Public Memory: The (Digital/
Physical) (Artifacts/Souvenirs) of the
(Archiver/Tourist)
Shane Tilton1
Abstract
This article will look at the impact that mobile technologies have had on the ability of people to document their everyday
lives. What is important to note about this documentation is that it has become a public display of events and experiences via
mediated content. This documentation becomes more interesting to observe when it is put in context of how people can now
record their travels. This "public memory" of private travel is assisted via mobile technologies with applications designed to
record locations through Global Positioning System data and mediated content. After the documentation, the consumption
of this content is conducted through social media services and other public outlets as opposed to the traditional means of
showing where people have traveled via postcards, slides, and souvenirs. Through a mixed-method study, this process of
documentation is analyzed via the thematic dichotomies that emerged throughout the course of surveys and interviews. This
article will explore this contrast between the digital and physical through an analysis of the "traditional tourist" versus the
"archiver of experiences." Finally, the impact of this documentation will be framed in the context of mobile communication.

elements of memory and the psychological elements of
shared memories/shared social experiences.
Most of the nominative constructions of the term public
memory tend to be embedded in the rhetorical aspects of com-
munication. This idea of "public memory" goes to the prac-
tice of public remembrance to cultural events. Condit (1985)
framed this concept within Aristotle's inartistic elements of
rhetoric. Primarily, Condit made the argument that public
memory performed an epideictic element of rhetoric as public
memory was normally invoked through the ceremonial
speeches surrounding a particular event (in Condit's example,
the Boston Massacre). Communication actions using epideic-
tic discourses allow for a definition of a public event by a
speaker via the sharing understanding of the context of the
event toward the larger whole shaped by the speaker. The
speaker shaped shared symbols to have a community focus on
one particular theme or image. The nature of these actions is
normally for the purpose of display or entertaining the com-
munity. Those commemorative discourses are normally for a
shared audience with a mass understanding.
Another aspect of public memory is the sense of placement.
According to Dickinson, Blair, and Ott (2010), the construction
of the public memory is tied to the rhetorical art of memory in
contemporary public culture. Public memory exists "at the
nexus of rhetoric, memory, and place" as this concept repre-
sents a deep complexity of events as they were occurring. The
connection between rhetoric and public memory was enhanced
by the works of Maurice Halbwachs (1992) and Michel
Foucault, Bouchard, and Simon (1977) as their work focused
on the forms of memory, which tended to be broken up and
defined by the cultural norms and the "language of the mem-
ory" in the mind of society. Place within this context notes the
terminologies of spaces, spatiality, sites, territory and
deterritorializing, border cultures, the urban and exurban, social
locations, geographies, zones, the archive . . . to reckon with the
complexities of what anyone might mean when s/he deploys one
or more of these terms. (Dickinson et al., 2010, pp. 22-23)
Public memory as a concept has a broad definition because
the theoretical discourse around the term public memory has
some semantical weight behind it. The definition fragments as
newer communication and humanities theorists explore the
central concept of memory. In communication, memory is one
of the foundations of rhetoric. This foundation adds to this dis-
cussion of the chosen definition of "public memory" for this
article because it exemplifies the need to observe the cultural
aspects of memory. The technological aspects of memory
related to the personal encoding and decoding of information
can best be theorized in the scientific/psychological realm.
Public Memory and Technological
Influence
The reason that the technological support of memory is
noted for this article is because the nature of memory distorts
without some method of recording. One of the major influ-
ences to this sense of memory is social influence. People will
normally conform to the "erroneous recollections of the
group, producing both long-lasting and temporary errors,
even when their initial memory was strong and accurate"
(Edelson, Sharot, Dolan, & Dudai, 2011, p. 108).
This representation of communal public memory can be
influenced through the normal discourse of communication
actions or through social interactions. The record of an event
can be "protected" from these social influences with a well-
constructed archival system designed to limit this layer of
social static and misinterpretation (Jacobsen, Punzalan, &
Hedstrom, 2013).
This archival element to the technological influence on
the public memory has often been framed in the scientific/
psychological realm as a version of collective memory. This
collective memory represents "an inherently mediated phe-
nomenon . . . as much a result of conscious manipulation as
unconscious absorption" (Kansteiner, 2002, p. 180). This
aspect of collective memory means that the dissemination of
events comes from channels of communication and mes-
sages embedded in those channels. Under the traditional
understanding of these channels of communication, the mes-
sages related to collective memory encoded in these channels
are often placed into these "linear, one-way channels of
description" (Hall, 2013). New media channels create a more
complete collective memory as the artifacts of the events are
placed in a shared space with the purpose of "making claims
about the subjective experience, as if claiming that a given
representation is a authentic recollection (neither perception
nor imagination)" (Haye, 2012, p. 27). This representation is
crafted through the co-creation of the meaning of memories
placed within the shared space under the guise that most of
the artifacts added to the shared space come with their own
set of bias and positional aspects. There is a sense of social
static and misinterpretation can exist with this space, but
there are embedded check and balances that can normalize
those elements of distortion.
This version of public memory described in this article is
not a representation of the communal public memory as col-
lective memory, but rather the publication of private or semi-
private events (e.g., traveling) into a semi-public or public
sphere (e.g., Instagram) as a way of remembering the experi-
ence and categorizing the elements of the experience via the
norms of the mode of communication (e.g., hashtags and
check-ins). Hashtags have the potential to act as the "guide-
posts" toward the shared spaces described earlier as they
function as a public link to a common set of pictures, posts,
and links that is hosted within the social networks of choice.
The common vernacular of hashtags has a shared lexicon
with significance and meaning. Those tags place individual
artifacts connected to the tag within a framework designed to
either support a community or maintain a dialogue around a
common theme or event (Alper, 2013). The second aspect of
the hashtags that is rarely discussed is their ability to act as
personal organizational tools. A person can search through
Tilton 3
his or her own feeds via typing his or her username and the
selected hashtags to find post with a significant importance
(e.g., the first trip abroad). These elements of selective filter-
ing influenced the creation of the methods used for this
research.
Method
The data from this article come from mixed-methods
approach using a survey and follow-up interview.Asnowball
sample technique was used that led to a sample size of 98
people (Goodman, 1961). A snowball sample was used due
to the point of analysis. The problematic in question is within
the range of those who travel and use SoLoMo to document
their travel. As this would be considered a specific popula-
tion, the use of the snowball sample seemed appropriate.
The surveys included 12 prompts on a 9-point Likert-type
scale. Those prompts focused on the use of social networks
and the tools used to access those social networks. In addi-
tion, there were 10 prompts on a 7-point Likert-type scale
that focused on audience awareness, travel practices, and
cultural awareness. The rationale for conducting the survey
was to make sure that the interview questions would fit the
"real world" as understood by the people and at the same
time would eliminate possible personal bias. The two differ-
ent types of Likert-type scales were required for this research
as the 9-point Likert-type scale prompts related to temporal
elements (once a year, once a month, 2 or 3 times a month,
once a week, 2 or 3 times a week, once a day, 2 or 3 times a
day, every hour, and multiple times an hour) to get a sense of
the survey taker relationship between themselves and the
tools of posting (technology and services), while the 7-point
Likert-type scale deals with the perceptions of survey takers
toward the tools of posting and thus had a "more traditional"
set of ranges within the scale (strongly disagree, disagree,
disagree slightly, neither agree or disagree, agree slightly,
agree, and strongly agree).
A structured interview was conducted after the survey was
completed. The interviews ranged from 15 to 20 min. The
interviewee was asked a few ethnographic questions that
closely resembled a "guided ethnography" (Tilton, 2012),
with the exception that the researcher would not be there to
observe them as they used their mobile devices. Interview
questions primarily dealt with how they use their mobile
devices when they traveled and whether they altered their doc-
umentation practices because of the SoLoMo applications.
To identify participants, the following message was sent
via Facebook feed and several group pages that dealt with
academic research:
Facebook Hivemind: I'm looking to interview about 30 people
about their use of FourSquare and Instagram, especially how
they use it when they travel. If you are interested in being
interviewed, please message me. If you are not interested in
being interviewed, please share this.
In addition, an abbreviated version of this call was sent
via Twitter. From this original call, 49 responses were
received. From those requests, the respondents were asked if
they knew anybody else that would fit both of the criteria.
From those requests, there were 49 more responses. Between
the two groups, the total sample size was 98.
Data Analysis
The sample size included 64 women and 34 men. Four of the
research participants were college students, and 2 of the
older participants were retired. All of the other participants
were employed, with 16 of them being employed in social
media/marketing-related positions. The participants all live
in the United States, and the pool includes individuals from
cities in the Northeast (Washington, DC; Boston, MA; New
York, NY; Arlington, VA), the Southeast (Raleigh, NC;
Chapel Hill, NC; Charlotte, NC; Atlanta, GA; Kennesaw,
GA; St. Augustine, FL), the Midwest (Chicago, IL;
Cincinnati, OH; Indianapolis, IN), and the Pacific Northwest
(Seattle, WA; Portland, OR; Central Washington state).
The interviewees were frequent users of FourSquare,
Instagram, or both. Frequent users were defined as people
who had more than 100 posts on one of the sites and had
checked in at least once in the previous 3 days. Of the survey
population of 98 people, there were 26 people who fit this
characteristic. Six of the participants were interviewed face-
to-face. Seventeen people were interviewed using Skype and
three people were interviewed using a phone with no video.
The interviewer did not notice an appreciable difference
between the face-to-face and Skype/phone interviews. A
grounded theory approach was used throughout the data col-
lection as a way of maintaining balance within the instru-
ment between a loose interpretation of the data and a narrow
deconstruction of the interviewee's statements (Charmaz,
2006; Glaser & Strauss, 1967).
The interviews were transcribed and placed within an
open coding procedure. There were extensive notes taken to
encode the interviews in a way that helped overlay the analy-
sis of the survey "on top of" the transcription of the inter-
views. Throughout the back and forth of interviewing and
coding, the data were organized into categories and eventu-
ally grouped categories based on thematic similarities. The
coding included multiple themes that emerged from the data.
Those themes were gathered by transcribing the 26 inter-
views, for a total of 10 hr of interviews. The transcripts of
those interviews were then coded to examine for common
themes. The researcher was the lone coder for the process.
The common themes were examined for patterns consistent
with the trend found in the analysis of the surveys. Finally,
those common themes were framed within the context of the
current research in the field. The artifacts from this coding
and selection process will be shown in the impact sections of
the article. For the purpose of this article, the focus will be on
three primary thematic dissidences that arose in the data.
4 SAGE Open
The next two sections deal with the analysis of the sur-
veys and interviews as a means of framing the thematics at
the end of this work.
Survey Analysis
As this was a mixed-method study, the analysis took on two
separate elements, an analysis of the survey and the coding
analysis for thematic elements of the interview. The initial
rationale for this process was to reinforce the qualitative
research and analysis with the analysis of quantitative instru-
ment. The survey instruments allowed for a clearer picture of
the people completing the interview process and better iden-
tified the limitations that may be present in an interview that
the researcher would not be aware of.
One of the most interesting data points that came to light
from the survey was with the prompt "I use my mobile
phone." All 98 of the participants responded by marking they
used their phone once a day or more. Of the 98, 79 partici-
pants marked that they used their mobile phones once every
hour, as noted in Table 1. This seems to be in line with other
similar research dealing with current usage of mobile phones
(Baron & Segerstad, 2010).
The next point of analysis is the documentation practices
of the sample population during their travels. The sample
population was divided between those who fit the character-
istics of the interviewee pool (n = 26) and those who did not
(n = 72). From these data, there was little difference in the
documentation and souvenir practices of those who were
interviewed versus those who were not. In terms of the ana-
log aspects of travel, both groups tended to buy souvenirs
about half of the times they travel. As noted in Table 2, more
often those purchases would be for themselves over family
and friends. In addition, this group was more likely to travel
alone than with friends or family.
The final point of analysis from the survey would be the
posting practices of the sample population. The only point of
divergence between the interviewee and non-interviewee
that stands out is their awareness of their audiences when the
post content about their travels. Those in the interviewee
group were less likely to be concerned about their audience
when posted travel content on their social media feeds com-
pared with the non-interviewee group. This point of diver-
gence is noted in Table 3.
This point of divergence helped shape some of the inter-
view instrument to find out what the interviewees focused on
when posted content from their trips.
Interview Analysis
With a smaller interview pool, it was necessary to craft the
questions to not only work with the larger problematic but
also the element raised during the survey regarding audience
awareness. This major point of separation between those
who were being interviewees and non-interviewees leads to
a deductive approach of interviewing and analysis
(Schadewitz & Jachna, 2007). The questions raised during
the interview focused on the interviewee's understanding of
memory and their audience awareness.
From the analysis of both methods, a series of thematic
dichotomies emerged that positioned the collection of digi-
tal artifacts while traveling into uses and gratifications
present when using any online services, especially those
services that can act as "catalysts for personal narrative
and recall" (Viegas, boyd, Nguyen, Potter, & Donath,
2004).

Digital Versus Physical
When a person captures the experience of travel and trans-
lates it into a mediated form, both the digital and the physical
are the same. A person can see the Grand Canyon in front of
him or her while taking the picture of it on a digital camera.
The farther you move away from the physical location, the
more the digital representation of that space becomes the
"authentic" symbol of your experience at that space. The
Instagram picture allows the person to experience the feel-
ings of being in the location through a combination of
observing the picture with the personally embedded textual
and location data within the picture. The comments attached
to the picture become the "vox populi" of the overall impres-
sion of the experience. This combination of all of the medi-
ated content represents the digital contextualization of the
experience.
In contrast, the physical represents a token, a takeaway
that allows the person to tactually touch elements from a
location where the person visited. This ability to touch the
object means that the object can be placed in space defined
by the person to be an area of significance based on other
objects of travel. Objects allow the person to immerse him-
self or herself in the memories of the travel via the sensory
relationship between himself or herself and the object. The
smell of suntan lotion on a piece of sea glass allows the per-
son to remember a trip to the beach via the smell.
The convergence of the physical and the digital is moving
closer together via the social media platforms and SoLoMo
apps.Aperson can look over his or her own feed on Instagram
or FourSquare to find a great place to watch a sunset. They
have the mediated experience of watching the sunset on
Instagram, which is a social media service design to share a
small (300 × 300 pixels in size) picture that can be framed by
the "filters" that the users can use to overlay on top of the
picture. This simple picture of the sunset also includes the
location where the picture was taken (either in the form of
Global Positioning System [GPS] data or location informa-
tion "borrowed" from Facebook or FourSquare) and other
textual provided by the Instagram community in the form of
comments and tags.
It is in this way that the difference between the digital and
analog is more than a "bits versus atoms" discussion; it is
also a "dynamic versus static" discussion. It is more than the
simple ability to store the elements and place them in some
form of order and structure. Dynamic allows for different
modes of selection and filtering. Static maintains a standard
form of selection. A person can look over his or her boxes to
view his or her collection of postcards. The digital elements
can be organized in multiple albums. The ability to tag these
elements allows for a more complex and comprehensive
approach to memory selection. For example, a person can
organize his or her elements based on the people associated
with the elements ("my wife" or "Grandma Sofia") or the
timing of the elements ("2013 Trips") or the physical loca-
tion the elements were taken from. One element can fit mul-
tiple organization platforms (Hine, 2003).
Artifacts Versus Souvenir
Artifacts are the small constructed elements that have some
cultural purpose (the postcards can be mailed to others to tell
about the trip or communicate some other aspect of travel) or
a social purpose (the Disney shot glasses can be used at a
party to serve drinks) that contains the visual cues of the
location that the artifact comes from. Sociologically, artifacts
become the central point of analyzing the practices of orga-
nized communities.
The ways that artifacts are used can tell a lot about a soci-
ety. Digital or physical artifacts have a sense of placement
that reflects the discourses about how the culture or subcul-
tures connect and interact with others. The slideshow is a
communal sharing of pictures that have some meaning to the
person or group sharing. In a similar fashion, the album or
feed on social media has some significance to the person
posting the photos without necessarily worrying about what
type of audience is viewing the work.
Souvenirs are mass produced works that are created to fill
the needs of the tourist as a trinket from location that has
some significance to the tourist as a representation of the
location (i.e., a piece of the Berlin Wall). In addition, souve-
nirs could be individually created and have a larger represen-
tation to societies in the form of collections or "placement."
For example, you can look at the collective nature of the
"pressed penny" as a self-created souvenir that not only rep-
resents the location (the person inserts a penny and some

other change to have the penny transform into a souvenir via
the pressing of a symbol of the location on the penny, thus
flattening the penny) but also the penny becomes an addition
to the penny collector collection.
Both the artifact and the souvenir in the area of public
memory represent a type of signifier in the ritualization of
travel. If ritual can be defined as a pattern of actions and the
process of those actions via a type of performance, then the
ability to collect digital artifacts or souvenirs has the same
weight as taking physical pieces from a location
(Rothenbuhler & Coman, 2005).
In the digital realm, the argument is that the poster of the
digital work is the performer and there is an audience that
can be actual (posting pictures for friends or family to see
them) or imagined. It is in this regard to talk about services
such as FourSquare as part of the ritual. FourSquare is a loca-
tion-based social network service where the users of the site
can go to locations in the real world and "check-in" on the
site to indicate they are at the location. As a "ritual leader,"
FourSquare is responsible for mediating the artifacts of the
experience (pictures taken at the location to prove aspects of
the experience) and the souvenirs (user can collect "badges"
based on their travel and check-ins). FourSquare also ampli-
fies the ritual nature of travel via the expression of the expe-
rience through mediated channel to the imagined other ("the
crowd").
As it relates to public memory, the important element to
note in this analysis of ritual is that the performer and the
audience can be one and the same. The performer in the pres-
ent is collecting artifacts and/or souvenirs for the purpose of
the future self to observe the aspects of the performance. A
person performs the aspects of the ritual of taking pictures
while travel. The person digs his or her phone out of his or
her pocket or bag. She or he goes to their camera app, takes
the pictures, and adds the metadata or other information rel-
evant to their current location and/or experience.
Archiver Versus Tourist
The last conflict to consider is the role of the person collect-
ing the elements related to travel. In the traditional mode of
discussing their role, the person would be described as a
tourist, with all of the semantic baggage associated with that
term. The tourist is defined as a person who travels from his
or her home to other place, while bringing all of his or her
cultural bias and frameworks to the place of travel. All new
experiences the tourist has while traveling are foreign based
on the binary of familiar/non-familiar.
This foreignness forces the tourist to reconceptualize
basic tenets of the mundane. Even the extremely basic func-
tion of getting up from sleep has the aspects of foreignness
(the bed is not their own, the location of clothing and basic
bathroom products would be different). It is also this foreign-
ness that frames the tourist interactions with people and the
inanimate.
The collections of memories are based on their relation-
ship to the "known" ("it tastes like chicken") and the
"unknown" ("why are they wearing those funny hats?"). The
collections of memories to the tourist are in the form of
mementos. Therefore, the idea of public memory for the
tourists would be the scrapbook of their own experience via
the mediated platforms.
Archivers are trying to understand the location of travel
through points of analysis and cataloging their experiences
within the context of the tools of collection. Analysis is con-
ducted via the reflective examination of the collection of ele-
ments within a mediated distribution platform. The picture of
the Grand Canyon is understood and placed within the con-
text of similar experiences, either personally experienced by
the archiver or through the aggregation of similar elements
within a common platform. The tools of collection mediate
the experience and transform the experience into an element
of analysis.
Impact on Mobile Media Space
As the interplay between mobile communication and the real
world is becoming more fluid, the ability to reflect on every-
day experiences becomes a mode of coping and adjusting to
the speed of life. The framework of this work was to explore
public memory through the view of its impact to document
travel for the individual. It is a natural connection as the
mobile device is a person's lifeline as they explore places
that she or he is not familiar with. It is their map, connection
to the outside world, recommendation engine for trying new
restaurants and, as explored in the course of this work, the
mode of documenting those new experiences. However, pub-
lic memory is more than a reflective mode of understanding
the world. It is a way of filtering and organizing all informa-
tion that an individual is exposed to on a daily basis. As peo-
ple are exposed to newer stimuli and feeds of information,
there needs to perhaps be agents that can help a person
actively document his or her own experience. In addition,
those agents could act as the extension of memory that can be
recalled via mobile devices. Those technologies, platforms,
and services could be thought of collectively as the public
memory of the individual with the purpose of being aware of
one's own environment.
Impact on Mobile Media Usage
One of the common themes from the interviews and the lit-
erature that impacts this concept of "mobile public memory"
is the increase of usage of mobile devices over the past
decade, specifically the consumption of mobile media.
Mobile phones have changed how people in the developing
world cope with their dynamic lives through the engagement
of the larger community. Of the 26 interviewees, 20 dis-
cussed how their mobile phone was an extension of them-
selves. Amber, a 29-year-old sales professional from New
Tilton 7
Orleans, stated, "If I left the house and realized that I left my
(Samsung) Note there, I would be running back for it. I feel
naked without it. My entire life is on my phone." Barry, an
African American 36-year-old freelance artist from
Columbus, discussed during his interview:
I only use my laptop when working on client's projects. When
I'm out, I have my DSLR (his digital camera) and my phone.
Sometimes, I'll just use my phone to take pictures, even if I have
my DSLR with me.
When pushed why he used his phone instead of his pro-
fessional camera, he said "it's easier to post from my phone
and it's quicker."
Part of the discussion related to mobile phone usage is the
"social disconnection" supposedly created by the use of
mobile device. The social disconnection within mobile
device relates to the anecdotal evidence that the more a per-
son consumes mobile media, the less likely that person is
able to maintain relationship away from the device. Hampton,
Sessions, and Her (2011) disputed this claim in the research
stating,
[i]n support of our hypotheses, findings reveal that neither
Internet nor mobile phone use is associated with having fewer
core discussion confidants, or having less diverse ties with
whom to discuss important matters. As predicted, mobile phone
ownership and specific Internet activities--the use of certain
"social media"--were found to be associated with having a
larger number of confidants. (p. 148)
This assertion was supported through the interview con-
ducted during this research. In all, 19 out of the 26 interview-
ees mentioned through the course of this research that they
felt the same number of friends or more when compared with
a decade ago.
These social connections were important to note in this
research because despite the observational point that the
interviewees felt they had more social connections, the post-
ings on SoLoMo apps and Instagram were more for the inter-
viewee rather than for the imagined audience. In all, 16 of the
26 interviewees very rarely use hashtags to attract audience.
Of the 26 interviewees, 19 would use a hashtag or GPS meta-
data on their postings as a way to remember an event or a
location they were at. Charlie, a 40-year-old educator, encap-
sulated this point when he said, "I remember my grandpar-
ents showing me their vacation slides and they were
organized in this carousels. I sort of see using the map on
Instagram or putting a hashtag in as organizing my photos in
those carousels."
Impact on Documenting Experiences
The second thematic of documenting experiences versus col-
lecting souvenirs was also reinforced from the interviews
and the previous literature. Both documenting experiences
and collecting souvenirs fit into what Neubaum, Rösner,
Rosenthal-von der Pütten, and Krämer (2014) would describe
as the "psychosocial functions of social media usage" and
framed such functionality within the uses and gratifications
of these services. The context of the psychosocial was bro-
ken down into information gathering and sharing and observ-
ing emotions. Neubaum et al. were studying how emotions in
a disaster situation were transmitted and expressed via social
media connections and public interactions online. The psy-
chosocial was also described in the documenting experiences
(the private interpretation of the SoLoMo postings) in the
observation of emotions and mentioned in the collection of
souvenirs (the public display of the SoLoMo apps) when
describing the sharing emotions. David, a 27-year-old male,
described these psychosocial elements by saying, "When I
travel, I will normally look at the pictures and comments
about a location from FourSquare, Yelp and Instagram. I find
this seems to be more of a realistic look at a place." This
would correspond to information gathering. He would later
talk about sharing the picture not with his followers on
Instagram, but rather with his family.
The last time I was in Boston, I went to a Red Sox (baseball)
game. I took a few pictures and post them on Instagram... I
wanted to show my son the pictures I took and I couldn't find
them on my phone. I went back through my Instagram feed and
found them. He likes Jonny Gomes and I wanted to show him
the pictures I took of (Gomes). He kind of giggled when (my
son) saw the pictures.
Impact on Posting Practices
The final thematic that was explored was the posting prac-
tices of the individuals on Instagram. Most of the literature
that studied posting practices on Instagram were looking
how the individuals captured everyday experiences with the
service (Memarovic et al., 2014) or how the foreign and
strange were "normalized" via the service (e.g., war photog-
raphy; Alper, 2013). In the case of Memarovic et al.'s
research, the service was mutated to a networked public dis-
play that could post snapshots taken on the display of an indi-
vidual at a location onto any service or website the individual
wished. The other option was to leave the picture on the pub-
lic display as a part of the example pictures on the display. Of
26, 18 chose to remove the pictures from public viewing and
place those snapshots onto private services. The public dis-
play, and therefore a more public audience for the photo-
graph, was rejected by a majority of the individuals. Those
individuals preferred a more private display of the photo-
graphs. The interviewees reinforced this private desire, spe-
cifically when discussing hashtags. Ellen, a 22-year-old
female sales representative from Austin, Texas, commented
on this by saying,
8 SAGE Open
Most of the time when I take pictures when I travel, I normally
don't post "'#postforlikes" or "#foodpron." I like having the
pictures on Instagram. But, I don't need a large group of
followers validating my pics or likes. Most of the time, I post the
pictures for me.
Limitations
The major limitation to this work was the snowball sample
that led to the survey takers and the interviewees. Both the
units for inclusion in the sample were not based on random
selection. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the possi-
ble sampling error and make statistical inferences from the
sample to the population. This research is not fully represen-
tative of the population being studied. The rationale for con-
ducting the survey and the interviews with a snowball sample
allowed for a more select group that would provide better
artifacts within the context of the thematics of the research.
The sample group was more familiar with tools of distribu-
tion being described in the research and could therefore artic-
ulate the elements of study needed to conduct this research;
specifically the sample could discuss the connection between
audience, memory, and the tools of distribution in a sensible
manner.
Conclusion
One of the common themes that has made up the current con-
ceptualization of the idea of memory is its connection to
mediated content. A by-product of this thematic understand-
ing of memory is how digital content has impacted this dis-
course. The collection of slides and postcards from trips long
ago have become the feeds of pictures from social network
services as we travel. The accessibility and ubiquity of this
content has changed the way that memories are captured.
There are multiple public systems and social networks
designed to catalog and distribute experiences in the form of
mediated content. Layers of metadata are embedded within
the content posted on these networks and services. As the
academy and scholars study the influence and impact of
mobile and social media on society, it is important to note
how these services and networks change people's memories
on previous experiences.
