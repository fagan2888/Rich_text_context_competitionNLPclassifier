Using data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, we identify differences in
hospital days, home health visits and physician office visits across five geographical
categories. After controlling for individual characteristics and availability of health care
providers, we find significant differences in service use. Results show greater use of home
health care and less use of physician office visits and hospital care in rural areas. Because
service use exhibits patterns of substitution and complementarity, future research on the
use of health services needs to move beyond modeling the use of single services to
modeling the range of services used.

Are rural elders disadvantaged with regard to health
care services? Despite considerable improvements in
health service delivery to rural communities, this ques-
tion remains unanswered, in part due to conflicting
reports on differences in health service use by rural
and urban elderly persons (Comer & Mueller, 1995;
Dubay, 1993; Himes & Rutrough, 1994; Kenney, 1993).
Recent policy changes in both the private and public
sectors have raised new concerns about access to care
in rural locations. For example, the closure of rural
hospitals (Coulam & Gaumer, 1991; Ricketts & Lambrew,
1993) and shortened hospital lengths of stay (Mick &
Morlock, 1990) indicate reduced access to and less
use of hospital services by the rural elderly. In addi-
tion, studies of outpatient physician utilization show
rural elderly residents receive approximately 20% fewer
services than urban elderly residents (Dor & Holahan,
1990; Long & Settle, 1984; PPRC, 1992). But, changes
in reimbursement mechanisms have resulted in a cor-
responding increase in the provision of post-acute and
chronic care services by home health agencies and
skilled nursing facilities. This paradox suggests that the
question of urban/rural differences in service use is

multifaceted and must be addressed in the context of
a dynamic environment.
One shortcoming of current empirical health ser-
vices research is that services are often studied in iso-
lation, focusing on only one type of service use. This
approach fails to capture the importance of the
constellation of services available to and used by in-
dividuals; consequently, potential substitution or com-
plement effects are ignored. In some cases, these
patterns may be interpreted as access problems when
they simply reflect alternative methods of providing
desired services. This study focuses on the comple-
mentary effects of each service.
A second weakness is that researchers often rely
on simple geographical typologies that fail to capture
important differences among rural residents and
communities. Rural health service researchers have
advocated the use of multiple descriptive categories,
rather than a simple urban/rural dichotomy, to cap-
ture unique characteristics of rural communities
(Coward, McLaughlin, Duncan, & Bull, 1994).
The purpose of this study was to advance our un-
derstanding of differences in health service use among
the elderly population by providing more accurate pro-
files of elders in the context of multiple service use--
hospital days, physician office visits, home health
visits and skilled nursing days. Combined, these ser-
vices represent more than 80% of all health care
spending for elderly adults. Using data from the Medi-
care Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), we identify
differences in service use across five geographical cat-
egories and describe profiles of use in each category.
These profile differentials have important policy and
practice implications for improving service delivery to
older people.

Urban and Rural Differences
in Health Service Use
Hospital Care.--Data on hospital discharges
show changing patterns in hospital use. Norton and
McManus (1989) and Moscovice (1989) reported that
Medicare beneficiaries in rural areas had more dis-
charges per capita than urban residents, but recent
studies show no significant differences in hospital use
between urban and rural residents (Himes & Rutrough,
1994; Comer & Mueller, 1995). Rural hospitals, as com-
pared to urban hospitals, have fewer beds (Moscovice,
1989), lower occupancy rates (Mick & Morlock, 1990)
and shorter lengths of stay (Mick & Morlock, 1990).
These characteristics suggest economic constraints and
pressures that drive providers to seek less costly alter-
natives to inpatient care, a view supported by Dansky,
Milliron, and Gamm (1996) who found that rural
hospitals were more likely than urban hospitals to re-
fer discharged patients to home health services. Com-
bined, these studies suggest that rural hospitals treat
patients who are older/but discharge the elderly pa-
tients sooner than their urban counterparts.
Home Health Care.--A financial incentive to dis-
charge patients earlier has increased the demand for
home nealth services. Studies report significant in-
creases in the number of referrals made to home health
agencies for hospitalized Medicare patients over the
last decade (Rogers, 1989; Mauser & Miller, 1994),
and a home health population that requires increas-
ingly more intensive services (Rogers, 1989; Wood,
Fox, Estes, & Mahoney, 1986). The demand for home
health care also increased following the Health Care
Financing Administration's revised definition of in-
termittent services (Bishop & Skwara, 1993). Finally,
changes in family structure have increased the demand
for home health services. In 1987, one in three eld-
erly persons lived alone (Branch, Goldberg, Cheh, &
Williams, 1993); this number is expected to rise pro-
portionally with increases in the aged population. Those
living alone are more likely to use some type of home
health services (Altman & Walden, 1993).
A literature review of studies published during the
last ten years indicates a lack of agreement on rural/
urban differences in home health services. Gaumer
(1989) and Kenney and Dubay (1990) reported fewer
home visits per Medicare patient in rural areas, and
Altman and Walden (1993) reported no differences
by region or metropolitan area. By contrast, Kenney
(1993) found that rural home health users received
more skilled nursing and home health aide visits than
their urban counterparts, but fewer medical social ser-
vice or therapeutic visits. Differences in the number
and mix of services available have been shown to af-
fect the utilization rates of home health care services
(Coward & Cutler, 1989; Kenney, 1993). Rural areas
are less likely to have a home health agency; when
they do, the agency is likely to be smaller and to sup-
port less diversity in services than its urban counter-
parts (Kenney & Dubay, 1990). Consequently, ther-
apy services (physical tnerapy, occupational tnerapy,
speech therapy) and social services are less available
than nursing services (skilled nursing and home health
aide).
Although the differences in home health use be-
tween rural and urban residents may be due to
access issues, differences may exist in the types of
patients receiving service (Nyman, Sen, Chan, & Com-
mins, 1991). The rural Medicare enrollee is more likely
to receive care from an informal caregiver (Coward &
Cutler, 1989). The older age, greater functional limi-
tations, greater risk of hospitalization and shorter length
of hospital stay (Kenney, 1993) of the rural beneficiary
may increase the need for home health services. In
an evaluation of hospitalization, intensity of service,
length of stay, and consumption of post-hospital ser-
vices, Gaumer (1989) found that rural home health
care recipients more often mirrored the profile of a
post-acute care patient while their urban counterparts
more often fit the use profile of the long-term care
patient. However, the former may have difficulty re-
ceiving appropriate post-acute care due to the scope
of services available in rural areas (Dubay, 1993).
Physician Visits.--Data from 1985 Medicare claims
showed that rural elderly persons had (price adjusted)
physician office expenditures of just 78% of the level
of urban elderly persons (Dor & Holahan, 1990). A
more recent analysis of Medicare Part B claims data
by the Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC,
1992), found that Medicare beneficiaries in rural
areas receive approximately 18% fewer physician ser-
vices (measured in relative value units or RVUs) than
other Medicare beneficiaries. Beneficiaries in frontier
counties (population density of six or fewer persons
per square mile) receive nearly 23% fewer services
(PPRC, 1992).
Physician availability is generally believed to be the
most important factor underlying these differences
(Coward & Cutler, 1989; Office of Technology Assess-
ment [OTA], 1990; Dor & Holahan, 1990). Rural ar-
eas have less than a third of the per capita level of
medical specialists found in metropolitan areas (OTA,
1990). However, the correspondence between physi-
cian availability and utilization rates is generally not
this direct. On a per capita basis, rural areas have two
thirds the general and family practitioners that urban
areas do (OTA, 1990), but rural elderly persons re-
ceive 40% more RVUs from these providers than do
urban elderly individuals (PPRC, 1992). Ongoing work
by Stuart and Shea (1996) suggests that rural residents
have far greater use of general practitioners, family
practitioners, and general surgeons, but far fewer
visits with specialty physicians and specialty surgeons.
Despite more than 40 covariates describing individ-
uals and availability of providers, these differences are
still not explained.
Research suggests that income and health insurance
coverage are significant predictors of physician utiliza-
tion among rural residents (Rowland & Lyons, 1989).
How important these factors are in explaining urban/
rural differences among the elderly population is less
certain. Medicare data for 1990 indicate that elderly
beneficiaries residing in rural, poor areas actually use
Vol. 38, No. 3, 1998 321
more outpatient care than rural beneficiaries in non-
poor areas (PPRC, 1992). But Dor and Holahan (1990)
found that income levels could not explain differences
in physician expenditures among elderly Medicare
beneficiaries. In the Dor and Holahan (1990) study,
the only variable to increase predicted use among ru-
ral residents to the levels of urban residents was phy-
sician resource characteristics. Thus, as Kane, Dean,
and Soloman (1979) suggested almost two decades
ago, although research indicates that rural populations
have lower utilization of care than do urban popula-
tions, the ability to quantify the extent and importance
of this difference is still missing.
Skilled Nursing Facilities.--Overall, studies on ur-
ban/rural differentials in the number of skilled nursing
facility (SNF) days show that rural residents spend
more days in the SNF (Nyman, 1989; Dubay, 1993).
Dubay (1993) found that the rate of SNF benefit use
for Medicare beneficiaries in rural areas is 15% higher
than that for Medicare beneficiaries in urban areas.
One explanation for this difference is that the supply
of certified nursing home beds per 1000 elders is higher
in rural locations than in metropolitan areas, suggest-
ing that rural elders may be "over-institutionalized"
(Shaughnessy, 1994). An alternative explanation is pro-
vided by Rowles (1994) who argues that rural com-
munities face a greater demand for intermediate type
institutional care because of the difficulties of deliver-
ing community and home services in remote areas.
This "substitution" argument is supported by Coward,
Duncan, and Freudenbarger (1994), who found that
SNF residents in rural facilities were more likely to
indicate that necessary services were not available in
their communities at the time of their admission to
the nursing home.
More recent research on the use of long-term care
services in rural areas continues to find higher rates of
institutionalization among elderly persons residing in
less urbanized and completely rural counties even
after controlling for a large number of covariates.
Coward, Home, and Peek (1995) and Coward, Duncan,
and Uttaro (1996) used data from the Longitudinal
Study on Aging, 1984-90 to estimate models of nurs-
ing home admissions controlling for more than two
dozen covariates. Despite these controls, they still
found that elderly persons in more rural areas were at
least 1.2 times more likely to experience a nursing
home admission than elderly persons living in more
urban settings. Although these studies do not control
for resource availability, Coward et al. (1996) docu-
ment the greater availability of nursing home beds in
these nonmetropolitan locations. As they note, we do
not know if demand leads to supply or vice versa, nor
do we know if these service use differences represent
underuse or overuse.
Predictors of Service Use
Individual Characteristics.--A review by Coward
and colleagues (1994) indicates that there are resi-
dential differences in both the demographic charac-
teristics and in the health status of rural versus urban
elders. A higher percentage of individuals over age 65
live in nonmetropolitan areas, and nonmetropolitan
areas have a higher percentage of individuals ages 75-
84. Additionally, rural elders have lower incomes and
less insurance, are more likely to be married, and are
less likely to live alone. With regard to health condi-
tions, there are significant differences between rural
and urban populations. Rural, nonfarm elders have
the worst health profiles, compared to the inhabitants
of any other residential category; these individuals are
more likely to report certain medical conditions (hyper-
tension, arthritis, or rheumatism) and to have more
functional limitations. However, Hayward, Pienta, and
McLaughlin (1996) found that rural men, on average,
live longer than do urban men.
Geographical Location.--Traditionally, studies on
rural health care have relied on a simple dichotomy
of urban versus rural to describe residential variation
(Coward et al., 1994). The most commonly used defi-
nition of "rurality" is the U.S. Bureau of the Census
definition of a rural area as being nonincorporated or
a place with fewer than 2,500 residents (Hewitt, 1989).
A major weakness to this approach is that dichoto-
mies frequently include as much variation in service
use within a category as between categories. To off-
set this limitation, the Health Resources and Services
Administration (HRSA) developed a ten-category
classification--the Human Resource Profile County Aa-
jacency Code (HRPCAC)--based on county popula-
tion size and adjacency to metropolitan areas, to
describe residential variation.
In summary, past research on urban/rural differences
in health service use by older persons presents a con-
fusing picture. In some cases, provider availability is
positively related to use; in other cases, it is nega-
tively related to use. For some services, urban/rural
differences nearly disappear after adjustment for co-
variates; in other cases, differences persist even after
controlling for a wide selection of covariates. Studies
of service types have failed to capture the importance
of the constellation of services used by individuals be-
cause they often focus on the use of one type of ser-
vice and the availability of one type of provider. The
purpose of this study was to advance our understand-
ing of the differences in health service use among
rural elders by providing more accurate profiles of
individuals who use services in the context of mul-
tiple service use--hospital days, physician office visits,
home health visits and skilled nursing days--and
multiple measures of provider availability. Addition-
ally, elaboration of urban and rural differences beyond
the traditional dichotomy will enhance our under-
standing of unique characteristics of rural elders as well
as the communities in which they reside.
Methods
Data Sources
The sample in this study was drawn from a pop-
ulation of 12,675 Medicare beneficiaries interviewed
for the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS)
322 The Gerontologist
in 1991. The MCBS is a nationally representative
longitudinal panel survey conducted under the aus-
pices of the Office of the Actuary in the Health Care
Financing Administration. Medicare beneficiaries are
interviewed three times a year with annual replace-
ment for attrition. MCBS interviews collect extensive
information on individuals' use and expenditures for
health services, source of payment, type of health in-
surance, access to care, health and functional status,
and socioeconomic and demographic characteristics.
The MCBS is linked to HCFA databases that provide
additional information on Medicare and Medicaid en-
rollment together with claims-based data on utiliza-
tion and expenses for Medicare covered services.
The size of our sample is 6,956. Included in the
sample were all MCBS survey participants who met
the following conditions: (a) aged 65 years or older
at the time of the Round 1 interview (2,476 excluded
because of age); (b) responded to both the 1991
Round 1 survey and the 1992 Round 4 survey (1,457
excluded); (c) interviewed in the community (892
excluded); and (d) not enrolled in an HMO (984 ex-
cluded). Restricting the analysis to individuals who par-
ticipated in both MCBS rounds was done to allow us
to use predetermined data on the independent vari-
ables from the last quarter of 1991 in the Round 1
survey to predict use of services from the claims data
in calendar year 1992. Because of the focus on am-
bulatory care and because certain questions were not
asked of institutionalized persons, these persons were
excluded. The HMO enrollees were excluded because
Medicare does not collect claims records from HMO
enrollees. The exclusion of those who are institution-
alized may bias our results by removing those in poorer
health. The exclusion of the HMO enrollees may bias
the results because of health differences and geo-
graphic differences in enrollment. HMO enrollees are
typically healthier and live in more urban or suburban
settings. Finally, the exclusion of those not present for
both survey rounds may include both some in better
health who moved to another location and those in
poorer health who died or changed households. Two
additional sample exclusions had to be made at vari-
ous points in the analysis. First, 185 persons could not
be matched to any county in the Area Resource File.
When totals are given in the descriptive data, these
people are included, although they do not fall into
any of the urban/rural categories. Second, 737 per-
sons were missing data on one or more of the ex-
planatory variables used in the regression analysis. These
persons had to be excluded from that part of the
study. While a comparison of the dependent and in-
dependent variables between our sample and the
HMO and facility residing populations snowed clear
and significant differences in the variables, a compari-
son of those excluded because of sample attrition,
missing ARF data, or missing survey variables did not
show significant differences in the dependent or in-
dependent variables.
Data from the Area Resource File (ARF), a comput-
erized data system developed and maintained by
the Office of Data Analysis in the Health Resources
and Services Administration (HRSA), were used for this
project. The primary purpose of the ARF is to provide
an updated source of county-specific data for health
planning and research. The ARF maintains over 7,000
variables, including data on geographic descriptors,
health professionals, and health care facilities and is
the most comprehensive public-use file available on
characteristics of the health care system at the county
level. The ARF geographical typologies (developed by
the HRSA) and data regarding the availability of health
services were used in this study.
The Provider of Services (POS) file, created by the
Department of Health and Human Services from the
Online Survey and Certification (OSCAR) database, was
used to provide estimates of health resource avail-
ability that were not available in the ARF or when the
POS data offered more current information than the
ARF. POS data include extensive information on Medi-
care providers of all types (excluding physicians) col-
lected through regional offices of the Health Care
Financing Administration. Through an agreement with
the Health Care Financing Administration, we were
able to link actual beneficiaries with their counties.
This allowed us to use the ARF and POS to identify
provider availability at the county level for each sampled
person.
Measures
Service Use.--The following interval level variables
were extracted from the MCBS data file: number of
inpatient covered days for 1992, number of home health
visits for 1992, total office visits in 1992, and number
of SNF days for 1992. The mean for all persons, the
mean for persons with one or more days, and the
percent with one or more days, were then calculated
for each geographical category. SNF days were included
in the descriptive analysis but later dropped due to
the small numbers in each geographical category.
Geographical Categories.--Because our principal
measures of health care resource availability are at the
county level (from the ARF), the definition must be
homologous to counties. The HRSA classification--based
on county population size and adjacency to metro-
politan areas--was used in this stuay to classify each
person in the MCBS into a geographical category. To
maximize power in our statistical analysis, five catego-
ries, rather than the prescribed ten, were used (see
Figure 1).
Demographic Characteristics.--Measures of individual
characteristics were obtained from self-reported data
in the MCBS. Raw data for age in years and number
of persons in household were used. Impairment in
activities of daily living (ADL) was operationalized as
the summed score of 6 items that measured limita-
tions in bathing, dressing, eating, getting in and out of
chairs, walking, and using the toilet. Impairment in
instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) was opera-
tionalized as the summed score of 9 items that mea-
sured limitations in stooping, lifting, reaching, writing,
using the telephone, doing light housework, making

sures of gender and insurance status.
Availability of Health Care Providers.--Data on
health resources in each county were obtained from
the ARF and POS files. The following measures,
operationalized at the county level, were used: ratio
of hospital beds, ratio of home health RNs, PTs and
aides, ratio of active physicians, and ratio of SNF beds
to county population.
Analysis
The unit of analysis is the individual MCBS respon-
dent. Descriptive statistics were calculated--first, for
individual characteristics of all respondents in our
MCBS sample; second, for each type of service use;
and third, for characteristics of the health care deliv-
ery system for each geographical category. Regression
equations were calculated to assess the effects of the
independent variables and covariates as predictors of
each type of service use. Significant predictors were
then used as control factors in multivariate analysis of
variance (MANOVA).
MANOVA, an extension of univariate analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA), is used to test hypotheses about the
relationship between a set of interrelated dependent
variables and one or more independent variables. In
MANOVA, a vector of means replaces the means
specified in ANOVA. The MANOVA procedure ad-
justs the means for each dependent variable by
simultaneously controlling for the other dependent
variables. The justification for using MANOVA is its
recognition of interrelationships among the dependent
variables. Substantial information may be lost when
the correlation between variables is ignored as in a
single equation model. Thus, one type of service use
must be studied in the context of other service use.
The covariates used are a set of 18 variables based
upon the Anderson and Aday (1974) framework. These
include several measures of individual predisposing
characteristics (e.g., age, gender), enabling (e.g., in-
come, insurance), and need (e.g. limitations in activi-
ties of daily living, self-reported health status). Charac-
teristics of the delivery system include the availability
of five health care resources: physicians, hospital beds,
nursing home beds, home health nurses, and home
health aides and physical therapists. All five availabil-
ity measures are included in each equation and each
regression includes all persons in the sample.
Although two-part models (including a logit or probit
for probability of use and a linear regression for level
of use) have been used in this line of research, our
interest in modeling the interrelationships between the
dependent variables precluded using a two-part model
approach.
The hypothesis being tested is that the population
means for the five geographical categories are the
same for all three types of service use (hospital days,
home health visits, and office visits). The dependent
variables are hospital days, home health days, and
physician office visits. MANOVA tested the effects of
geographical location and the covariates on the three
service types.
Results
Service use for each of the five geographical cat-
egories is illustrated in Table 1. Observation of the
data reveals few consistent patterns of service use
differentials. Residents in large, metropolitan fringe
counties have the highest levels of use for inpatient
days; persons in completely rural areas have the high-
est level of home health use; persons in large metro-
politan core counties have the highest level of physi-
cian use. The lowest levels of use are found among
completely rural residents for inpatient days and
nonmetropolitan urbanized residents for home health
visits and physician visits. Overall, residents in the
urban categories (large metropolitan core, large met-
ropolitan fringe and medium metropolitan) tend to
have more inpatient covered days and office visits than
residents in the rural categories (nonmetropolitan
urbanized and completely rural). Residents in the com-
pletely rural category tend to have more post-acute
(home health and skilled nursing facility) use than resi-
dents in other categories.
These differences in overall use result both from
differences in the probability of use and in the level
of use for those with some nonzero use, though the
latter seems most important. For example, residents
in metropolitan areas are almost equally as likely as
residents in the completely rural areas to have one
home health visit; the service use difference in home
health is driven by the large number of mean visits
for persons with at least one visit. In hospital care,
similarly, the difference between the metropolitan and
nonmetropolitan areas is driven largely by differences
in the number of days of care, rather than the likeli-
hood of a hospitalization.
Individual characteristics and characteristics of the
health care delivery system for each geographical
category are illustrated in Table 2. This sample of
Medicare beneficiaries is predominantly female
(60.3%), White (87.9%) and in good to excellent health
(74%). A large majority (84%) has some type of pri-
vate insurance, and 6.8% have public insurance other
than Medicare.

Observation of these data reveals differences in
the profiles of elders. Rural elders have fewer mem-
bers in their households, and have greater ADL and
IADL impairment. Although there are fewer males
than females in each category, the two rural catego-
ries have a greater proportion of males than the two
most urban categories.
Inspection of the data on availability of health care
services reveals obvious differences among categories,
with the greatest disparities occurring between core

metropolitan locations and completely rural locations.
Adjusting for population density, in the most rural
areas there are fewer hospital beds and fewer physi-
cians but far more SNF beds. Particularly notable is
the difference in availability of physicians per 100,000
persons, with almost five times the number of physi-
cians in core metropolitan areas as there are in com-
pletely rural locations.
These provider availability measures seem roughly,
not strongly, correlated to the service use differences.
While the greater hospital beds to population ratio in
metropolitan core areas corresponds with greater use,
hospital use is higher in the metropolitan fringe where
bed supply is lower. Home health worker availability
is greatest in nonmetropolitan urbanized areas, yet use
of home health care is lowest in those areas. Physi-
cian availability appears to follow the more expected
pattern of a positive relationship between resources
and use.
Results of regression analysis (illustrated in Table 3)
show that age, ADL impairment, Medicaid coverage,
household size, and fair or poor health status are sig-
nificant predictors in all models of service use. In ad-
dition, gender, race, and education are associated
with home health and physician use; marital status is
associated with home health use; very good health is
associated with physician use; and good health is as-
sociated with inpatient and physician use.

326 The Gerontologist
None of the health care availability variables were
significant predictors of hospital use. The ratio of
hospital beds to population was positively related to
home health use, while the ratio of SNF beds to popu-
lation was negatively related to home health use. The
ratio of home health aides to population was also a
positive predictor of home health visits. In the regres-
sion model with the number of physician office visits
as the dependent variable, the ratio of home health
aides to population was inversely related to the num-
ber of office visits.
Results of the MANOVA show the effects of geo-
graphical location and the covariates on the three
service types (see Table 4).
Observation of the adjusted means for hospital use
shows that, when controlling for other service use types
along with the covariates, rural elders still use fewer
hospital days than urban elders, with residents in the
most completely rural areas using the fewest days. Thus
the differences in hospital use between urban and
rural categories are only partially explained by char-
acteristics of the individuals and availability of health
care providers. We also found that geographic loca-
tion may explain differences in service use for home
health visits and physician visits. Again, comparing the
urban categories with the rural categories, home
health visits are lower in core metropolitan areas and
higher in completely rural areas. The opposite effect
is noted for physician office visits, with the highest
number of visits provided in the core metropolitan
areas and the fewest in the completely rural areas.
Overall, these results provide strong evidence
that differences in service use remain, even after con-
trolling for individual characteristics and availability of
health care providers. In the most completely rural
counties, where residents have greater ADL and IADL
impairment and fewer members in their households,
the pattern observed is fewer hospital days and physi-
cian office visits, but more home nealth visits. Analysis
of between-group comparisons of the two rural cat-
egories showed significant differences in service use.
Residents in completely rural counties, compared to
residents in nonmetropolitan counties with urbanized
areas, use fewer hospital days (t = 1.763, p < .10)
and fewer physician office visits (t = 2.223, p < .05),
but more home health visits (t = 3.058, p < .01).
Discussion
The purpose of our research was to elaborate dif-
ferences in service use across geographic location
categories. In the multivariate analysis, we used indi-
vidual characteristics and community characteristics as
covariates with geographical location to predict ser-
vice use. Our results support the view that individual
characteristics partially explain differences in service
use. Age was a significant predictor of hospital days,
home nealth visits, and office visits. The mean age of
elders in large metropolitan core areas is higher than
for other locations, partially explaining high hospital
use in that geographical category. ADL and IADL im-
pairment is highest in the completely rural category,
and the mean number of household members was
lowest in that category. These factors combined may
contribute to high home health use by rural residents.
Gender as an independent variable had a main effect
on each of the services but did not interact with geo-
graphic location.
Our analysis was limited to available data; other
individual characteristics may contribute to service
use and should be considered in future analyses. For
example, Schlenker, Shaughnessy, and Hittle (1995)
found that Medicare beneficiaries receiving care from
fee-for-service home health agencies received more
home health visits, compared to HMO enrollees. Since
the sample of MCBS respondents we used excludes
HMO enrollees, we were not able to examine reim-
bursement factors in this analysis.

home health RNs, physical therapists and aides, add
an important dimension for explaining service use. A
long history of research finds correlation between re-
source availability and use of services, although theo-
retical and empirical understanding of the causal rela-
tionship remains controversial (Folland, Goodman, &
Stano, 1997). Our results, which show significant vari-
ation in service use and availability of providers among
the five geographical categories, extends this literature
to another stage. When our results show significant
correlation between provider availability and service
use, however, it is often across service categories. Thus,
home health visits are correlated with hospital and
SNF bed availability. Physician visits are correlated with
home health aide availability.
This finding suggests that the adage that Roemer's
Law--a "built bed is a filled bed"--needs to be re-
considered. Perhaps a built nursing home bed is an
unemployed home health aide. In short, these results,
while certainly preliminary, suggest research into the
relationships between service use and provider avail-
ability must go beyond simple counts of one type of
service and one type of provider. More detail on the
services used ana the availability of the network of
providers of various types is needed. For example, physi-
cian visits and physician availability can be examined
by specialty groupings. In some preliminary work on
this issue, we find that the traditional finding of less
physician use by rural residents is far more compli-
cated. Rural residents exhibit more general practitio-
ner visits but fewer internal medicine and specialty
medicine services. There are few differences across
regions in individual use of hospital-based physicians
or surgical specialists. These geographic differences
persist even after controlling for provider availability
(Stuart & Shea, 1996).
We found significant differences in home health use
between the two rural categories even after control-
ling for covariates. Residents in the most completely
rural areas receive approximately 3.5 times the num-
ber of home health visits that residents in rural coun-
ties with urbanized areas receive. This pattern sug-
gests that home health services may provide a "safety
net" in remote rural areas, substituting for both formal
and informal services. For example, home health
visits may substitute for physician office visits. Home
health nurses can provide assessment of patients
with congestive heart failure to determine if a hospital
admission is required or follow-up with a newly diag-
nosed person with diabetes to evaluate treatment
response. Table 4 shows the most home health visits
and the fewest physician office visits being provided
in the most completely rural areas. This pattern, how-
ever, is not repeated in the nonmetropolitan urban-
ized population. Additionally, nursing and aide home
visits may substitute for formal community services.
Research on aging network services (Krout, 1989) in-
dicates that rural communities are less likely to pro-
vide services such as adult day care, guardianship,
housing and respite services. Further research is
needed to identify specific types of home health visits
(nursing, therapy, aide) and possible substitution
effects.
Policy & Practice Implications
Key sources of potential differences in service use
include characteristics of the health delivery system,
characteristics of the population, and characteristics of
the area or place. Identifying elements within these
broad classifications and their relative importance in
explaining utilization differences is critical to the de-
velopment of informed public policy. Our results, which
show variability in elderly service use patterns within
rural America, argue for a more targeted approach
to improving rural health services delivery.
This research did not investigate how characteris-
tics of the area may affect service use; however, this
is likely to be a fruitful line of future research. The
advances in the use of geographic information systems
to turn spatial information into data amenable to
empirical analysis holds great potential for health ser-
vices research. Future study might focus on identify-
ing and incorporating geographic barriers to care,
enabling the study of the effects of networks of social
service agencies, or other measures that might be de-
veloped from this technology.
Trie profiles of elders who use Medicare-reimbursed
services indicate differentials in use between urban
and rural residents. Our results are also consistent with
earlier studies, which found that rural residents are
older and have more functional limitations. This dif-
ference in individual use, however, has not been
closely linked to differences in quality of care or out-
comes. Recent studies report gaps in service continu-
ity between hospital discharge and home health care
for rural, frail elders (Dansky, Dellasega, Shellenbarger,
& Russo, 1996; Reiley, lezzoni, & Phillips, 1996). In
the Dansky et al. (1996) study, elders aged 80 years
and older were more likely to report benefits from
home health visits. Future studies should begin to link
specific patterns of health care use of the Medicare
population in rural areas to measures of health care
quality or outcomes. If use is different, yet achieves
the same outcome, then perhaps the networks of
rural providers have found effective ways of coping
with the greater needs of the rural populace.
Past efforts to address geographic utilization differ-
entials have usually focused on providing incentives
to attract specific health care professionals, especially
physicians, to rural areas. These supply-side policies,
emphasizing the characteristics of the nealth delivery
system and the availability of certain providers, have
met with limited success (Kane et al., 1979; New-
house, 1992). While not minimizing the importance
of primary care physicians in rural communities, we
argue that policy needs to consider more fully the
array of services needed and how they can be pro-
vided using different combinations of providers. The
combination of physicians, nursing homes, hospitals,
home health agencies, and other providers that
works in an urban setting may differ from that which
works in a rural area. Questions concerning the ap-
propriate configuration of helping networks among
elderly rural residents remain unanswered. Evaluating
the complementary roles of the range of formal and
informal services in remote rural areas may have the
328 The Gerontologist
most potential for improving service delivery to rural
elders.
The trend toward integrated health care delivery
underscores the need to identify and provide the
appropriate mix of services for rural clients. Effective
service delivery in rural areas requires innovative and
cooperative approaches by diverse health and human
services providers. To accomplish this objective,
Medicare and Medicaid reimbursed services must
be integrated (clinically and financially) with rural
community-based services. The challenge, as noted
by Longino and Smith (1994), is to do more than sim-
ply "patch old pants with new cloth" (p. 240); it is to
learn how to help older people stay healthy longer
and to do so in ways that fit into the communities in
which they live.
Directions for Future Research
Our research extends current work that indicates
that many of the measurable demand and supply
factors fail to explain differences in patterns of use.
Improvements are needed in research designs to help
us understand further the complexities in service use.
We offer the following recommendations to advance
this line of research.
First, research must move beyond single equation
methods of estimation toward more complex MANOVA,
path, and simultaneous equation models. Patterns of
substitution between services as diverse as physician
care, hospital care, nursing home care and home health
care must be fully explored in models that can con-
sider correlation between the errors of the various
equations, as well as endogeneity of the dependent
variables. Second, research must continue to explore
multilevel modeling using individual, familial, local,
state, and national contextual variables. Finally, research
paradigms must broaden to include psychological, so-
ciological, economic, geographic, demographic, and
other variables in the explanatory set. Questions that
address how regional and community characteristics--
for example, transportation, geographic boundaries
or local culture--influence health seeking behaviors
should be studied. Qualitative as well as quantitative
methods should be encouraged to produce a finer-
grain analysis of service use. A broader paradigm and
more complex methodology will allow researchers to
address several gaps that now exist in the literature.
