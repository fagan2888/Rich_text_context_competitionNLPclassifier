Objectives: To assess the relationship among depressed
mood, physical functioning, and severity of illness and to
determine the relationship between depressed mood and
survival time, controlling for severity of illness, baseline
functioning, and characteristics of patients.
Methods: Prospective cohort study of data for 3529 se-
riously ill hospitalized adults who received care at 5 ter-
tiary care teaching hospitals and who completed a de-
pressed mood assessment 7 to 11 days after admission
to the study. The Profile of Mood States depression sub-
scale was used to assess depressed mood. A stratified Cox
proportional hazards model was used to assess the in-
dependent effect of depressed mood on survival time, ad-
justing for demographic characteristics of patients and
health status.
Results: Greater magnitudes of depressed mood were
associated with worse levels of physical functioning
(r=0.151; P.001) and more severity of illness. De-
pressed mood was associated with reduced survival time
after adjusting for patient demographics and health sta-
tus (hazards ratio, 1.134; 95% confidence interval, 1.071-
1.200; P.001).
Conclusion: Seriously ill patients should be assessed for
the presence of depressed mood even if they have not been
given a diagnosis of depression. Further study is needed
to determine whether interventions aimed at relieving de-
pressed mood may improve prognosis.

SEVERAL INVESTIGATORS have
found an association be-
tween depression and mor-
tality.1-6 However, depres-
sion also has been shown to
be strongly associated with poorer func-
tional status1,7-13 and severity of ill-
ness.14-17 Whether a causal relationship ex-
ists between depression and mortality or
whether depressive symptoms are mainly
markers for unmeasured severity of ill-
ness is unclear.5
Past researchers have not studied the
associationsamongphysicalfunctioning,se-
verity of illness, depressed mood, and mor-
tality in a population with high mortality.
Toaddressthisissue,weanalyzeddatafrom
patients enrolled in the Study to Under-
stand Prognoses and Preferences for Out-
comesandRisksofTreatments(SUPPORT)
project. In the SUPPORT project, patients
were assessed for mood state during hos-
pitalization; detailed measures of physical
functioning and severity of illness were in-
cluded.18 Patients were observed for 6
months after admission to the study. Dur-
ing this time, 47% of the patients died. Be-
cause detailed measures of physical func-
tioningandseverityofillnesswereavailable
for these patients, we were able to adjust for
the relationships among depressed mood,
severity of illness, and functional status to
determinewhetherdepressedmoodwasin-
dependentlyassociatedwithmortality.This
enabled us to study the independent effect
of depressed mood on mortality while
controlling for factors that may have con-
founded the relationship between de-
pressedmoodandmortalityinpaststudies.
Specifically, we determined the as-
sociation of depressed mood with physi-
cal functioning and severity of illness in a
severely ill hospitalized population1,6-11 and
the independent association of depressed
mood with survival after adjusting for con-
founding by functional status and sever-
ity of illness.2,9-13

gibility included the following: died before the inter-
view, 1853; intubated or in a coma, 957; did not pass the
cognitive screening test, 382; or unable to communi-
cate, 900. Of the remaining eligible patients (n=5013),
3529 completed the mood assessment. Reasons for not
completing the interview or scale were as follows: the pa-
tient refused, 572; the physician refused for the patient,
159; the surrogate refused for the patient, 300; the pa-
tient did not answer 3 or more of the mood assessment
questions, 181; or the patient could not be located after
discharge from the hospital, 272.
The median age for patients in the study was 63 years,
and the median educational level was 12 years. Of the
patients, 58% were men, 78% were white, and 52% were
married. The most common disease groups were acute
respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, chronic ob-
structive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer (Table 1).
The median APS score at day 3 of the study was 29.0.
The median number of comorbid illnesses was 2.0, and
the median number of disabilities was about 0.5. Of the
study patients, 42% died within 41/2 years of admission
to the study. Characteristics of the patients used in the
analyses are listed in Table 1. The median POMS de-
pressed mood score was 0.37 on a 0 to 4 scale. Figure 1
shows the depressed mood scores for the sample.
Patients who completed a depressed mood assess-
ment interview and those who did not differed on sev-
eral key demographic, severity of illness, and outcome
variables. Those who completed the questionnaires were
younger (mean age, 61 years vs 64 years; P.001) and
tended to be men (58% vs 42%; P.01), had a lower day-3
APS (41 vs 31; P.001), had more comorbid illnesses
(mean, 2 vs 1.8; P=.001), but were more functional (mean,
1.2 vs 1.8 ADL dependencies; P=.001).
FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DEPRESSED
MOOD SCORE
The associations of factors with depressed mood scores
are given in Table 2. Older persons were less de-
pressed than younger persons (r=-0.121; P.001). More
dependencies in ADLs were associated with worse de-
pressed mood scores (r=0.151; P=.001), as was greater
severityofillness(r=0.083; P=.001).Consistentwith these
PATIENTS AND METHODS
PATIENTS
Patients were enrolled in the SUPPORT.18 This study was
conducted from June 1989 to January 1994 at 5 teaching
hospitals in the United States. Enrolled patients repre-
sented a range of adult patient populations: urban and rural,
lower and higher income, and black, white, and Hispanic.
Patients were included in SUPPORT if they met pre-
determined selection criteria for a diagnosis of acute res-
piratory failure, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease, exacerbation of congestive heart failure,
end-stage liver disease, nontraumatic coma, stage III or IV
non­small cell lung cancer, colon cancer metastatic to the
liver, or multisystem organ failure with sepsis or a malig-
nant neoplasm. In aggregate, this population had a pro-
jected 6-month mortality of 50%. Patients were excluded
if they did not speak English; had acquired immunodefi-
ciency syndrome, head trauma, or burns; were pregnant;
were younger than 18 years; were admitted to a hospital
with an expected length of stay of less than 72 hours; died
within 48 hours of hospital admission; or were trans-
ferred from another hospital to a hospital participating in
the study.18
Data were collected by abstraction from the medical
chart and by structured interviews. Data from the medical
chart included diagnoses, comorbid illnesses, and physi-
ological data including the acute physiology score from the
AcutePhysiology and ChronicHealthEvaluation(APACHE)
III.19 The SUPPORT prognostic model generated 2-month
and 6-month survival estimates for each patient based on the
burden of illness at the time of admission to the study.20 The
SUPPORT model has been shown to adjust well for severity
of illness and has an area under the receiver operating char-
acteristic curve of 0.78 for predicting survival.20
Patients were interviewed between 2 and 5 days after
admission to the study (the day-3 interview) and again
between 7 and 11 days after admission to the study, if the
patient remained hospitalized, or within 5 days of dis-
charge from the hospital. During the day-3 interview, pa-
tients were asked about demographic characteristics (in-
cluding age, race, sex, marital status, and educational level)
and functional status 2 weeks before hospitalization as mea-
sured by a modified Katz Index of Activities of Daily Living
(ADL) scale.21 Mood assessment was performed during the
second interview, approximately 1 to 2 weeks after admis-
siontothestudy,ifthepatientremainedhospitalized,orwithin
5 days of discharge from the hospital. Of the patients eli-
gible for an interview, 74% completed the second interview.
For 5% of these patients, data were missing for 3 or more de-
pressed mood items. We included only patients who pro-
vided information about mood in this analysis (N=3529).
VARIABLES
Clinical
We used a modified Katz ADL scale as a guide to ask pa-
tientsaseriesofquestionsabouttheirself-careabilityforbath-
ing, washing, eating, walking, toileting, dressing, transfer-
ring (ie, independent moves in and out of bed and chair),
and continence.21 The surrogate (the person identified by the
patient or physician as the person who would make deci-
sions for the patient if the patient were unable) was asked
to assess the patient's ability using the same questions. If re-
sponses about ADLs were unavailable from the patient, the
surrogate's responses for the ADL scale were used to calcu-
late the ADL score. If data from the patient and surrogate
were missing, an imputed score was used.22 The ADL scores
ranged from 0 to 7, with 0 indicating independence in all
activities and 7 indicating the worst physical functioning.
Three measures of the severity of illness were used in
this analysis: the acute physiology score (APS) of the
APACHE III score on day 3 after admission to the study;
the number of comorbid illnesses present at the time of
admission to the hospital and the estimate from the

findings, a higher estimate of the probability of 6-
month survival was negatively associated with de-
pressed mood (r=-0.057; P=.001). Although these rela-
tionships were statistically significant, the relationships
were weak.
To test whether depressed mood had an indepen-
dent effect on survival time, age, ADL score, the APS on
day 3 of the study, the number of comorbid illnesses,
and sex, the 6-month survival estimate and depressed
mood score were simultaneously entered into a strati-
fied Cox proportional hazards model predicting sur-
vival. Table 3 gives the coefficients, standard errors of
the coefficients, the exponential value of the coeffi-
cients, and the 95% confidence intervals for each covar-
iate in the model.
In this model, the ADL score (P.001), the num-
ber of comorbid illnesses (P.001), the 6-month esti-
mate of survival from the SUPPORT model (P.001), age
(P.01), and depressed mood (P.001) independently
predicted survival time. The 2 of the model was 308 when
the df was 7. For example, an increase of 1 ADL depen-
dency increased the odds of a shorter survival time by
9.5%. An increase of 1 comorbid illness increased the odds
of a shorter survival time by 13%. The odds associated
with survival time decreased by 13.4% with every unit
increase in depressed mood score. Thus, compared
with the odds of shorter survival time, depressed mood
is in the same range as ADL dependencies and comor-
bid illnesses.
Figure 2 shows the estimated probability of sur-
vival time for increments of the POMS depressed mood
score, the number of comorbid illnesses, and age. The
estimated survival for each increment of the variable was
calculated separately, holding all other variables in the
model constant at their median. The difference between
a score of 0 (ie, no depressed mood) and a score of 2 (ie,
moderate level of depressed mood) was associated with
an 11% decrease in the estimated survival time, whereas
the difference between having no comorbid illnesses and
4 comorbid illnesses was a 17% decrease in the esti-
mated survival time. On the other hand, differences in
age were related less strongly to the estimated survival
time: a 40-year increase in age led to a difference of a 9%
reduction in the estimated survival time.
SUPPORT project model for 6-month survival,20 which con-
siders several clinical indicators of severity of illness.
Mortality
Survival time was calculated by subtracting the patient's date
of death from the date of admission to the study. The re-
sult was the number of days the patient survived from ad-
mission to the study until death.
For analysis, the final vital status was defined by
whether the patient was known to be alive 41/2 years after
admission to the study. We continued contacting patients
up to 180 days from admission to the study for interviews,
or next of kin to document deaths. After 6 months, the
names and social security numbers of patients were traced
through the National Death Index (US Dept of Health and
Human Services, National Center for Health Statistics, Bal-
timore, Md) for a 4-year period to determine vital status.
Depressed Mood
Depressed mood was measured using the depression
subscale from the shortened version of the Profile of
Mood States depression scale (POMS).23 The subscale
consists of 8 items (ie, unhappy, sad, blue, hopeless, dis-
couraged, miserable, helpless, and worthless). For each
descriptor, patients were asked whether they had felt
this way during the past week. The possible responses
were as follows: 0, not at all; 1, a little; 2, moderately; 3,
quite a bit; and 4, extremely. A depressed mood score
was obtained by summing the points and dividing by the
number of items in the scale. The range of depressed
mood scores was thus 0 to 4, with a higher score indicat-
ing a more depressed mood. If 1 or 2 items were miss-
ing, the score was calculated by using mean substitution.
If 3 or more items were unanswered, the depressed
mood score was considered missing (n=181). The Cron-
bach  for this version of the POMS was .89, indicating
good internal consistency or reliability.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Age, years of education completed, marital status, and sex
were used to describe the patient population. Because many
of the variables had skewed distributions, nonparametric
statistical procedures were used to compare groups within
the sample and to study bivariate relationships. To deter-
mine whether significant differences existed between the
2 groups, independent sample Wilcoxon rank sum tests were
used to compare the sample that completed the depressed
mood assessment with the sample that did not complete
the assessment. The Spearman rank correlation was used
to evaluate the bivariate relationships between depressed
mood and patient characteristics, illness characteristics, and
mortality.
The mortality rates for the 9 disease categories in the
SUPPORT project varied during the 6 months of observa-
tion. For example, patients with a primary diagnosis of acute
respiratory failure or multisystem organ failure had higher
30-day mortality rates than patients with colon or lung can-
cer, but they all had similar 180-day mortality rates.20 These
differential mortality rates violate the assumption of the Cox
proportional hazards model that baseline risk is the same
across disease groups. Therefore, a Cox proportional haz-
ards model stratified by disease group was used to test
whether depressed mood had an independent effect on sur-
vival time. The disease groups included acute respiratory
failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic heart
failure, liver disease, cirrhosis, colon cancer, lung cancer,
and multisystem organ failure with a malignant neoplasm
or sepsis. The independent variables in the model in-
cluded age, ADL score, APS, the number of comorbid ill-
nesses, sex, the 6-month survival estimate from the
SUPPORT model, and the POMS depressed mood score.
The interaction of ADL with depressed mood also was tested.
However, results proved to be insignificant and, there-
fore, are not included in the final analysis. All the analyses
were performed using statistical software (SPSS for Win-
dows, release 6.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill).

COMMENT
We studied the association of depressed mood and mor-
tality in a group of severely ill hospitalized adults by us-
ing a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. What
made the present study unique was our ability to assess
a demographically and medically diverse group of hos-
pitalized adults, whereas past research on depression or
depressed mood had used mainly homogeneous groups
of subjects, thus, limiting generalizability.
Depressive symptoms, or affect, have been found to
be associated with increased mortality rates in patients
in nursing homes.1,2 Many studies have found a predic-
tive effect of depressive symptoms on mortality in pa-
tients with various long-term diseases.1,5,8-11,24-29 By us-
ing a Cox proportional hazards model stratified for disease
group, we found that depressed mood and severity of ill-
ness independently predicted survival time. Depressed
mood had a significant association with survival while
accounting for severity of illness, physical functioning,
and patient demographics.
In contrast, some investigators have not found a re-
lationship between depressive symptoms and mortal-
ity.5,30-32 Most studies with negative results have studied
mortality in elderly populations in nursing homes rather
than community-based samples. For an older popula-
tion in poor health, factors other than depression may
be stronger determinants of mortality; depression may
be minimal and, thus, may not be significantly associ-
ated with mortality. Or, older persons may be more likely
to die regardless of mood.

The literature on physical functioning and depres-
sion suggests a tendency for depression to worsen as physi-
cal health declines.8,11 In a review of 17 articles on physi-
cal functioning as measured by ADL scales, Schubert et
al9 found a relationship between poor physical function-
ing and level of depression in 11 articles and no relation-
ship in the other 6 articles. Our results suggest that pa-
tients who reported low levels of physical functioning,
as measured by the ADL scale, also were more likely to
report a greater magnitude of depressed mood than pa-
tients with higher levels of physical functioning.
Some have argued that for patients with chronic and
severe illness, it is the illness that produces a decline in
physical functioning and not depression. However, Wells
et al16 found that although chronic illness alone did not
affect physical functioning, the addition of depressive
symptoms was associated with a significant reduction in
functioning. Koenig et al14 studied consecutive admis-
sions to the neurologic service of a Veterans Adminis-
tration medical center and found that physician-rated
global severity of illness, as measured by a general summed
rating of illnesses and the number of prescribed medi-
cations, explained 17.3% of the variance in depression.
Parkerson et al15 also found that subjects with the high-
est combined severity of illness and disability scores also
scored worse on depression scales than subjects with low
severity of illness and disability scores.
When severity of illness is measured by patients' per-
ceptions of their illness, the association with depression
is significant, but when severity is assessed by using clini-
cal data, the relationship diminishes.5 While clinical data
may be important to the study of clinical outcomes, they
may have little effect on specific patients' perceptions or
understandings of their illness. Depression also may af-
fect how patients interpret clinical information.
In the present study, the associations between de-
pressedmoodandseveritywereweak,butinthepredicted
direction.Itispossiblethatbecauseoftheongoingnature
oftheirillnesses,patientsinourstudymayhavebetterclini-
cal understanding of their medical conditions compared
with patients in previous studies. This understanding, in
turn, may have been reflected in their mood.
Our study had several limitations. First, our analy-
sis was based on interviews of patients who agreed to par-
ticipate in the study and were able to be interviewed. The
sickest patients in the study could not be interviewed.
We do not have data to suggest that the responses of the
sicker patients would be different from or similar to those
of the patients who were interviewed. Even so, our study
included patients with greater severity of illness than in
previous studies.
Second, our interview did not include a structured
psychiatric evaluation. Therefore, we could not diag-
nose major depression or depressive disorders or assess
the relationship between clinical depression and mor-
tality. However, our analysis does show that a simple easy-
to-administer depressed mood inventory is indepen-
dently associated with mortality, emphasizing the

importance of depressed mood regardless of the pres-
ence or absence of major depression.
Third, we cannot make causal linkages between the
development of depressed mood and survival because we
did not measure the development of depressed mood from
before hospitalization until death. Still, we were able to
control for some factors believed to confound the rela-
tionship between depressed mood and survival, so that
we can conclude from our data that depressed mood has
an independent relationship with survival time.
CONCLUSION
We found that depressed mood was independently re-
lated to the survival of seriously ill hospitalized pa-
tients. The relationship between depression and mortal-
ity is complex. Our study extends previous research
because we controlled for the confounding effects of physi-
cal functioning and severity of illness on depression. How-
ever, our study does not explain the mechanisms under-
lying the relationship between depressed mood and
mortality. Depressed mood may contribute to mortality
through biological mechanisms, perhaps mediated by a
link between mood and immunologic function.33 De-
pressed mood may affect mortality because depressed
mood can reduce social and psychological functioning
and, thus, reduce a person's ability to cope with severe
illness, which, in turn, may affect survival.34-38
Why does depressed mood affect survival? Is it be-
cause patients who have a depressed mood are more likely
to be pessimistic about their future and make decisions
that have a negative effect on outcome? Are patients with
depressed moods more willing to forgo aggressive treat-
ments than patients without depressed mood? Research
to better answer these questions is urgently needed. We
hope to address these questions in future research.
Our study indicates that clinicians need to be aware
of the patient's mood, even if the patient has not been
given a diagnosis of major depression. Because treating
depression is easier than increasing the physical func-
tioning of an ill patient, the treatment of depressed mood
may be the most effective of available interventios.
