Raising Low `Patient Activation'
Rates Among Hispanic Immigrants
May Equal Expanded Coverage
In Reducing Access Disparities
ABSTRACT There is a growing consensus that activating consumers to
become better managers of their health is an essential component of US
health care reform. We measured how activated blacks, whites, and
Hispanics are--that is, how confident, skillful, and knowledgeable they
are about taking an active role in improving their health and health care.
We found that patient activation among blacks and Hispanics was low,
relative to that of whites. For example, 24.8 percent of Hispanics were at
the highest level of patient activation, compared to 39.5 percent of blacks
and 45.3 percent of whites. Among Hispanic immigrants, low accultura-
tion and lack of familiarity with the US health care system contribute to
low activation. The findings indicate that increasing activation levels
among Hispanic immigrants may be as important as expanding insurance
coverage in reducing disparities in unmet medical need.
Many Americans expect the Af-
fordable Care Act of 2010 to
reduce racial and ethnic dis-
parities in health care, pri-
marily by reducing the num-
ber of racial and ethnic minorities who are
uninsured.1 Much of the attention paid to dispar-
ities has focused on the higher uninsurance rates
of some minorities. However, differences in
what is known as "patient activation" are also
likely to contribute to racial and ethnic dispar-
ities in access and health care.2
Patient activation refers to the knowledge,
skills, and confidence people need to manage
their health and health care. The Patient Activa-
tion Measure--part of the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation's Health Tracking Household Sur-
vey3--scores people on a scale of 0 to 100; those
who score higher tend to be proactive in manag-
ing their health, and those who score lower tend
to be more passive. Racial and ethnic differences
in patient activation have been documented, and
both blacks and Hispanics have lower activation
levels than whites.4
Less-activated people may have greater access
problems because their greater passivity about
their health means that they are more likely to be
deterred by barriers to care. They are less likely to
get preventive services, adhere to treatment reg-
imens, seek out health information, or ask ques-
tions during a medical encounter, and they are
more likely to have unmet medical need.5­9 Acti-
vation levels have also been shown to predict
clinical outcomes.10
In this study we examined differences in pa-
tient activation among whites, blacks, and
Hispanics. We also examined reasons for lower
activation among blacks and Hispanics relative
to whites, focusing on differences in socio-
economic status and immigration characteris-
tics that reflect differences in acculturation
and familiarity with the US health care system.11
Finally, we examined the extent to which racial
or ethnic differences in patient activation are
related to differences in unmet medical need,
independent of differences in insurance cover-
age, socioeconomic status, and health status. To
the extent that differences in activation are re-

would seem that merely increasing insurance
coverage among racial and ethnic minorities will
not eliminate disparities in access.
Study Data And Methods
Data Source The estimates in this report were
based on our analysis of the 2007 Health
Tracking Household Survey,3 a telephone-based
survey funded by the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation and the successor to the Community
Tracking Study Household Survey that was
fielded four times between 1996 and 2003. The
Health Tracking Household Survey was admin-
istered to a sample of about 17,800 people, who
were representative of the civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized US population. The survey collected
data on all of the adults in each family and one
randomly selected child. The sample for this
study was adults age eighteen and older who
responded to the Patient Activation Measure
questions (N ¼ 12; 396). The response rate for
the survey was 43 percent. We used survey
weights to generate population estimates ad-
justed for nonresponse based on age, sex, race
or ethnicity, and education.
Survey questions used to obtain respondents'
race or ethnicity were based on those used by the
2007 Current Population Survey conducted by
the Census Bureau.We excluded from the catego-
ries white and black people who also identified
themselves as Hispanic in origin, and we in-
cluded all races in the category Hispanic. Whites
were overrepresented in the sample: About
76 percent of the sample population was white,
compared to 66 percent of the US adult popula-
tion in 2007. Blacks and Hispanics were under-
represented: They constitute about 10 percent
and 8 percent of the sample population, respec-
tively, compared to 12 percent and 14 percent,
respectively, of the US adult population.
Survey weights used in the analysis adjusted
the estimates to reflect the actual distribution of
these groups in the population and to account
for any differences in nonresponse within each
racial or ethnic group based on sex, age, and
education. A methodological report provides a
more detailed discussion of the weighting pro-
cedures and standard error estimation.3
Measure Of Patient Activation As noted
above, the thirteen-item Patient Activation Mea-
sure was included in the 2007 Health Tracking
Household Survey (the online Appendix lists the
thirteen questions).12 Our analysis focused on
racial and ethnic differences in mean levels of
patient activation. However, the analysis also
included racial and ethnic differences in the per-
centages of people at the highest level of activa-
tion, which is often easier to interpret than dif-
ferences in mean scores.
Prior testing of the Patient Activation Measure
identified four levels of activation or engage-
ment, reflecting the fact that people move
through levels as they become better self-
managers. These four levels indicate people
who (1) may not understand that they must play
an active role in their health; (2) lack the con-
fidence and knowledge necessary to take action;
(3) are just beginning to take action to maintain
and improve their health; or (4) have adopted
many proactive health behaviors but still face
challenges in maintaining those behaviors over
time--for example, maintaining a healthy life-
style. In this analysis we focused primarily on
those at the highest level of activation: people
who have attained much of the confidence,
knowledge, and skill needed to effectively man-
age their health and health care.
Other Survey Measures The Health
Tracking Household Survey recorded respon-
dents' age, sex, educational attainment (in
years), and family income. Health insurance
coverage was defined as being insured on the
day of the interview and was coded as a single
two-category variable indicating whether re-
spondents had insurance (either public or pri-
vate) or were uninsured. The survey also in-
cluded a measure of perceived general health
and a checklist of the most prevalent chronic
conditions.13 Access to medical care or unmet
medical need was determined using the answer
to the question: "During the last twelve months,
was there any time when you didn't get the medi-
cal care you needed?"
In addition, respondents were asked to iden-
tify themselves as US-born or foreign-born.
Those who were foreign-born were asked
whether they were naturalized US citizens and
the length of time (in years) they had been in the
country. Those who were US-born were asked
whether one or both of their parents were born
in the United States or outside of the country.We
defined second-generation Americans as people
who had one or both parents born outside of
the United States. We defined respondents who
had two parents born in the United States as
third-generation American or higher.
Limitations As with any research study, there
are some limitations to these analyses. The data
are cross-sectional, which means that we cannot
conclude with certainty the causal relationship
between patient activation and access to care,
only that there is an association. We used only
a single measure of access to care--unmet need--
and the association with patient activation may
differ for other measures of access. Furthermore,
the measure of self-reported unmet need did not

allow us to assess differences in unmet need
based on clinical assessments, which is a limita-
tion of all household survey measures of access.
In addition, it is likely that immigrants in the
United States illegally and without proper docu-
mentation were underrepresented in the survey
and not accounted for by the survey weights.
Activation levels of undocumented Hispanic im-
migrants are likely to be similar to recent immi-
grants--that is, lower compared to Hispanics
who have been in the country longer. As a result,
levels of patient activation among all Hispanics
in this study may be higher, and Hispanics' dif-
ferences with whites and blacks smaller, than is
the case in the population at large.
Study Results
Racial And Ethnic Differences Average pa-
tient activation scores for the study population
(Exhibit 1) are comparable to those found in
other studies using the Patient Activation Mea-
sure.14 Both Hispanics and blacks had signifi-
cantly lower average scores than whites. Further-
more, Hispanics' scores were significantly below
those of blacks. Only 24.8 percent of Hispanics
were at the highest level of activation (level 4),
compared to 45.3 percent of whites and 39.5 per-
cent of blacks.
Differences By Immigration Status Al-
though there were differences in activation be-
tween white and Hispanic foreign-born and
second-generation Americans, there were no sig-
nificant differences between whites and His-
panics who were third-generation Americans
or higher (Exhibit 2). But because only 20 per-
cent of Hispanics in the sample were third-
generation or higher (compared to 90 percent
of whites; findings not shown), overall activa-
tion levels for Hispanics were lower than for
whites. The sample included too few blacks
who were foreign-born or second-generation
Americans to enable us to make direct compar-
isons with whites and Hispanics.
Lower activation among foreign-born and
second-generation Hispanics compared to sim-
ilar whites may reflect the fact that foreign-born
and second-generation whites--such as immi-
grants from Canada or Western Europe--may
be culturally more similar to US-born whites.
In addition, second-generation and foreign-born
whites havemuch highereducational attainment
and income than similar Hispanics (findings not
shown). Both factors were associated with
higher patient activation across all racial and
ethnic groups (findings not shown).
Explaining The Differences To examine
how much of the racial or ethnic difference in
patient activation reflected differences in socio-
economic status versus acculturation of immi-
grants, we used multivariate regression analysis
to compute adjusted estimates of patient activa-
tion. These adjusted estimates controlled first
for differences in socioeconomic status (income
and education) and demographic characteristics
(age, sex, region of the country, and metropoli-
tan versus nonmetropolitan residence), and
then for differences in acculturation (US-born
versus foreign-born, length of time in the United
States, citizenship, and generation).15
Exhibit 3 summarizes the results of the multi-
variate analysis. The first adjustment assumed
that blacks and Hispanics were similar to whites
on demographic and socioeconomic character-
istics (that is, they have the same mean values),
with immigration and acculturation factors al-
lowed to vary. Adjusting for these factors ex-
plained much of the difference in activation be-
tween whites and blacks. This is especially
evident for the percentage in the highest activa-
tion level, where the gap between whites and
blacks in the adjusted estimates (45.3 percent
for whites versus 43.3 for blacks) was much
smaller than in the unadjusted estimates
(45.3 percent versus 39.5 percent).
Differences in activation between Hispanics
and whites, however, were still large even after
we accounted for differences in demographic
characteristics and socioeconomic status. Even
a difference of four to six points in activation

migration and acculturation factors as well as on

past year. Patient activation was included as an
independent variable, in addition to health in-
surance coverage (coded as insured by any
source versus uninsured) and demographic,
socioeconomic, and health characteristics.
The negative regression coefficients for pa-
tient activation in Exhibit 4 indicate that for
whites, blacks, and Hispanics, higher activation
levels were associated with less unmet medical
need. The association between patient activation
and unmet need (accounting for other differenc-
es) was statistically significant. To quantify the
magnitude of the association between patient
activation and access, we estimated the percent-
age with unmet need assuming blacks and His-
panics had the same average activation levels as
whites.16 In other words, how might access to
care change for blacks and Hispanics if their
levels of activation increased to a level similar
to that of whites? We also estimated the percent-
age with unmet need assuming all three groups
were at the highest level of activation.
A comparison of the actual percentage of
respondents who had unmet need with the simu-
lated percentage with unmet need assuming
higher activation levels shows that if Hispanics
had levels of activation similar to those of whites,
the percentage of Hispanics with unmet need
would decrease by a fifth (from 11.8 percent to
9.4 percent) and would be similar to that of
whites with unmet need (9.2 percent). If blacks
had levels of activation similar to those of whites,
the percentage of blacks with unmet need would
decrease only slightly (from 13.4 percent to
12.6 percent), a level still higher than unmet
need for whites (again, 9.2 percent). In sum,
the findings suggest that increasing patient
activation may have a bigger impact on reducing
access disparities for Hispanics than for blacks.
To compare the association of activation and
insurance coverage on unmet need, we also esti-
mated whatunmet needwould be if alluninsured
people instead had coverage. Exhibit 4 shows
that in that case, the percentage of whites with
unmet need would decline to 7.5 percent. The
percentages for blacks and Hispanics are
9.2 percent and 10.1 percent, respectively. Com-
bining increased patient activation with univer-
sal coverage would greatly reduce unmet need
for all three groups and would largely eliminate
disparities in unmet need between them: The
percentage of each group with unmet need
would be at or close to 5.0 percent.
Discussion
The findings in this study indicate that increas-
ing patient activation can be an important com-
ponent of reducing racial or ethnic disparities in
care, particularly for Hispanics. Although His-
panics have much higher uninsured rates than
either whites or blacks, other studies have dem-
onstrated these disparities in coverage usually
do not explain all of the disparities in access.17,18
The findings in this study suggest that lower
patient activation may be an important reason
for greater unmet medical need, particularly
among Hispanics.
These results suggest that strategies to in-
crease patient activation among Hispanics will
also need to address acculturation to US society
and English-language proficiency. Evidence that
such approaches can be effective is emerging. A
study that examined the effect of a culturally
appropriate intervention designed to increase
patient activation among a largely Spanish-
speaking Hispanic population showed improved
adherence to treatment and increased skills in
communicating and negotiating about the medi-
cal encounter.19,20

Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that
providers influence their patients' activation lev-
els. Patients who reported that their physician
provided specific help with self-management of
health--such as help setting up an exercise pro-
gram, instructions on monitoring their condi-
tion, or assistance in setting goals--were more
activated than patients who did not get that kind
of support.11 Other studies show that programs
providing peer support and skills development,
such as the Stanford Chronic Disease Self-
Management Program, also increased patient
activation.21 Finally, when patients received sup-
port tailored to their level of activation, they were
more likely to increase their activation and to
have improved health outcomes.22
All of this suggests that delivery systems can be
designed to support patient activation. Ulti-
mately, delivery systems and providers will need
to view increased patient activation as an impor-
tant outcome of care and provide culturally ap-
propriate supports to achieve this end.
Although our findings show a strong associa-
tion between patient activation and access to
care--independent of insurance coverage--the
causal relationship between activation and ac-
cess is likely to be more complex. Lack of cover-
age and other barriers to health care probably
contribute to low patient activation, which in
turn reinforces the perception that care is either
unavailable or unaffordable. Removing eco-
nomic barriers to care may be a necessary first
step, although not sufficient by itself, to increas-
ing patient activation among the uninsured. In
addition, our analysis did not directly control for
other factors that contribute to racial or ethnic
differences in unmet need, such as cost sharing
on the part of the insured, the supply and avail-
ability of medical providers, patients' health lit-
eracy, and transportation barriers.
Conclusion
Historically, health policy makers have focused
on improving the functioning of various compo-
nents of the delivery system and on addressing
gaps in coverage. Yet evidence is mounting that
policy makers also need to focus on enabling and
supporting consumers so they can be effective
participants in the system. In other words, just
like providers and facilities, consumers have a
key role to play in an efficient delivery system.
Understanding which groups are less prepared
to take an active role in their care, and delineat-
ing the consequences for those groups and the
larger system, is the first step toward developing
effective policy. Reform of the health care deliv-
ery system will need to include mechanisms for
educating and supporting patients who are not
as well prepared as others to become more en-
gaged, activated partners in their care.

equivalent models were estimated
for whites, blacks, and Hispanics.
The adjusted estimates were com-
puted on the models for blacks and
Hispanics, using means for whites
on selected variables.
16 We computed percent with unmet
need for each group by setting mean
activation levels as specified in
Exhibit 4, and all other variables
equal to their group means.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS: PETER J. CUNNINGHAM, JUDITH HIBBARD &
CLAIRE B. GIBBONS
Peter Cunningham
is a senior fellow
and director of
quantitative
research at the
Center for Studying
Health System
Change.
In this month's Health Affairs,
Peter Cunningham and coauthors
examine levels of "patient
activation"--the knowledge, skills,
and confidence people need to
manage their health and health
care--among Hispanics relative to
whites and blacks. They find lower
levels of activation among recent
Hispanic immigrants in particular,
and they observe that increasing
these may be as important as
expanding insurance coverage in
reducing access disparities.
Cunningham is a senior fellow
and director of quantitative
research at the Center for Studying
Health System Change (HSC),
which conducts health policy
research and analysis and was
founded by the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation. He has
published extensively on such
topics as access to care, insurance
coverage, racial and ethnic
disparities in care, the financial
burden of health spending, and the
health care safety net.
Since 1996 Cunningham has
directed the design and analysis of
HSC's Health Tracking Household
Survey and that of its predecessor,
the Community Tracking Study
Household Survey. Cunningham
received his doctorate in sociology
from Purdue University.
Judith Hibbard is a
professor at the
University of
Oregon.
Judith Hibbard is a professor of
health policy in the Department of
Public Planning, Public Policy, and
Management at the University of
Oregon. For thirty years she has
focused on consumer choices and
behavior in health care, with an
emphasis on testing approaches
that give patients more knowledge
and control over their health care.
Her studies examine such topics as
how consumers understand and use
information on health care quality,
how health literacy affects choices,
enrollees' behavior within high-
deductible health plans, and
assessments of patient and
consumer activation.
Hibbard holds a master of public
health degree in health education
and behavioral sciences from the
University of California, Los
Angeles, and a doctorate in public
health with a focus on social and
administrative services from the
School of Public Health at the
University of California, Berkeley.
Claire Gibbons is a senior
program officer in the Research
and Evaluation Unit at the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation. She has
written extensively on such topics
as the child welfare system and
substance abuse. She has a
doctorate from the School of Public
Health at the University of North
Carolina and a master of public
health degree from the University
of Rochester.
