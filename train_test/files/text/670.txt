The Longitudinal Study on Aging (LSOA) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) are used to examine
change in the prevalence of disabilityfrom 1982 through 1993 for persons 70 years of age and over. Changes in the
likelihood of becoming disabled and the likelihood of recoveringfrom disability also are investigated with the LSOA.
There is some evidencefor improving disability status among the old. Theprevalence ofdisability is somewhat lower in
more recentyears in the NHIS; also, the incidence of disability is lower, and the rate of recovery higher during 1988-
90 than in the 1984-86 interval. On the other hand, the prevalence of disability increases at some dates after 1984 in
the LSOA sample. In both datasets, there is fluctuation rather than a clear trend in the prevalence of disability.
Continued steady improvement in rates of onset and recovery and a consistent trend toward improving prevalence is
needed before concluding that we are witnessing the beginning of an ongoing trend toward improving health among
the older population.
DISABILITY among elderly persons is a major personal,
familial, and social concern. Documenting trends in
disability and understanding their causes is important for
how individuals, families, and societies plan for providing
health care and long-term care in the future. This is particu-
larly true for those planning for the provision of care to older
age groups. Elderly persons will increasingly become the
majority of the United States population needing long-term
care because of chronic disability.
At any given time, the proportion of older persons dis-
abled in a population is determined by past rates of incidence
of disability, past rates of restoration in functioning, and the
history of death rates of the disabled and nondisabled per-
sons in the population. This study examines change from
1982 through 1993 in the prevalence of disability and the
rates affecting this prevalence among the community-
dwelling elderly population using data from the Longitudi-
nal Study of Aging (LSOA) and the National Health Inter-
view Survey (NHIS). Four questions are addressed: (1) is
there any change during the 1980s and early 1990s in the
prevalence of disability, (2) in the likelihood of older per-
sons becoming disabled, (3) in the likelihood of recovery
from disability, or (4) in the likelihood of dying when
disabled or nondisabled? Thus, we are looking for evidence
of change in the prevalence of disability in the older popula-
tion and in the processes that affect this level of disability.
Background
Previous investigations of trends in the prevalence of
disability in the adult population have indicated that, for
most adult age groups, reported disability-prevalence in-
creased in the U.S. through the 1970s and into the early
1980s (Colvez and Blanchet, 1981; Crimmins, Saito, and
Ingegneri, 1989; Verbrugge, 1984). During these years,
however, increases in disability were not observed among
those aged 75 and above (Crimmins and Ingegneri, 1993;
Schneider and Guralnik, 1987). While some have expressed
skepticism about the validity of observed increases in the
prevalence of disability (Waidmann, Bound, and Schoen-
baum, 1995), others have noted that with declining mortality
from chronic conditions it is possible that the prevalence of
disability could increase (Crimmins, 1990; Crimmins, Hay-
ward, and S.aito, 1994; Verbrugge, 1989). Yeas (1987) has
suggested that the general increase in adult disability in the
1970s may have been replaced by stability during the first
part of the 1980s, and Manton, Corder, and Stallard (1993)
report a decrease between 1982 and 1989 in the prevalence
of disability in the population aged 65 and over. Trends in
the incidence of disability are the most important determi-
nant of trends in the prevalence of disability (Crimmins,
Hayward, and Saito, 1994); however, there have been fewer
studies of trends in the incidence of disability. Crimmins and
Ingegneri (1993) report that the period of increased disability
prevalence during the 1970s also was a time of increased
incidence among the age groups whose prevalence in-
creased. They also reported that for those 75 years of age and
over there was no change in either prevalence or incidence
during the 1969 to 1981 period. Using data from the Na-
tional Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS), Manton, Corder,
and Stallard (1993) report a decrease in the incidence of
disability, as well as the prevalence of disability, among the
noninstitutionalized population over 65 between 1982 and
1989.
Because understanding the current state of disability is
imperative for predicting our future needs for long-term
care, we use additional sources of information on disability
S59
S60 CRIMMINS ET AL.
in the older population to examine recent change. The annual
prevalence of disability among those 70 years of age and
over for each year from 1982 to 1993 is available from the
NHIS. This annual survey of over 100,000 people of all ages
is a source of reliable annual age-specific measures of the
prevalence of disability. In addition, the LSOA -- more
similar in design to the NLTCS -- is another source of
prevalence information for four dates (1984, 1986, 1988,
and 1990); it allows examination of change over three
periods in the processes that determine prevalence. A pattern
of systematic time change in prevalence as well as change in
incidence and recovery rates from disability would provide
greater understanding of the current and future level of
disability among the older population.
Recent Improvement in the Incidence and Prevalence
of Disability
Before presenting our results, we will discuss in some
greater detail the findings of Manton, Corder, and Stallard
(1993) from the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS).
This is a third data source that has been used to examine
recent change in prevalence of disability among the older
population; it is the only source other than the LSOA of
information on incidence change for the national population
over this period of time. The 1982, 1984, and 1989 NLTCS
samples are representative of the United States Medicare
population, which provides the sampling frame for this
survey. About 20,000 people are screened or interviewed at
each wave, including a new sample of young respondents, to
maintain the sample as one representative of the population
65 years of age and older. The screening is used to identify
disabled people, who then receive a detailed interview. With
three waves of data, the NLTCS allows the examination of
the prevalence of disability at three dates and the incidence
in two intervals.
Disability status in the NLTCS is defined using informa-
tion on ability to perform 8 instrumental activities of daily
living (IADLs: light housework, laundry, meal preparation,
grocery shopping, getting around outside, getting to places
outside of walking distance, money management, and using
the telephone) and 6 activities of daily living (ADLs: eating,
getting in or out of bed, getting around inside, dressing,
bathing, getting to the bathroom, or using the toilet). For a
person to be ADL-disabled in the NLTCS, it was necessary
that the person report that the activity "had not been per-
formed, or was not expected to be performed, without the
aid of another person or the use of equipment for at least 90
days." A person was IADL-disabled if he or she "could not
perform one of the IADLs for 90 + days because of disabil-
ity or health problems" (Manton, Corder, and Stallard,
1993). In the Manton and colleagues' analysis, people are
divided into those with IADL disability only, 1-2 ADLs, 3 -
4 ADLs, 5-6 ADLs, and the institutionalized population.
The findings of Manton, Corder, and Stallard indicate a
very small (1.7%) but statistically significant decrease in the
percent of the population 65 years of age and over who were
disabled between 1982 and 1989. The changes in prevalence
were not consistent, however, across types and levels of
disability. The percentage with IADL disabilities who were
not in institutions declined significantly (1.4%), but there
was no change in the percentage with ADL disability among
the noninstitutionalized. Change in the percentage of the
population with a given level of ADL deficits was mixed.
There was no significant change in the prevalence of 1-2
ADL disabilities; the percentage with ADL disabilities in-
creased significantly (0.7%); and the percentage with 5-6
ADL disabilities declined significantly (0.9%). The decrease
in the institutional population (0.4%) between 1982 and
1989 was just statistically significant, but there was no
change in the percent institutionalized between 1984 and
1989.
Manton, Corder, and Stallard (1993) also report decreases
in the incidence of disability among the noninstitutionalized
population between the 1982-84 period and the 1984-89
period. For the nondisabled, the probability of becoming
disabled decreased and that of remaining nondisabled in-
creased. Both changes were statistically significant although
the absolute values of these incidence changes were small,
i.e., generally the likelihood of an outcome changed by 1 to
2 percent.
A more detailed look at some of the reported transition
probabilities for the disabled group suggests that the evi-
dence for reduction in disability is inconsistent. If disability
were decreasing for all, transition probabilities for move-
ments to better functioning states should increase, and prob-
abilities toward deteriorating functioning should decrease,
but this does not describe the findings from the NLTCS.
Because the NLTCS intervals between waves are 2 years
and 5 years, the researchers make assumptions to translate 2-
year rates into 5-year rates and 5-year rates into 2-year rates,
and present results for both interval lengths. While results
are not identical, generalizations drawn from either set are
similar and the following discussion is based on the 2-year
transitions.
Examination of the change in the 2-year disability transi-
tions among the 65-and-over population indicates an in-
crease in the likelihood of remaining in each of the four
disability categories. This finding, coupled with an increase
in the likelihood of remaining nondisabled, means the likeli-
hood of staying in any functioning state, nondisabled or
disabled, increased. On the other hand, the likelihood of
making a shift to any other functioning state, either better or
worse, decreased in almost all cases. In 75 reported compari-
sons of the age-specific percent changing disability state for
two periods among those who began the period noninstitu-
tionalized, only in six cases does the percent changing
functioning state increase in the later period. Four are
changes representing deteriorating functioning; the other
two are change toward improving functioning (Manton,
Corder, and Stallard, 1993). In general, in later years, the
likelihood of becoming nondisabled was lower for all cate-
gories of the disabled; the likelihood of going from a more-
disabled to a less-disabled state was lower; and the likeli-
hood of going from a less-disabled to a more-disabled state
was lower. Thus, the evidence from the NLTCS on reduced
disability for the older population in the 1980s is somewhat
mixed. Given the lack of consistency in the pattern of change
from the NLTCS, it seems appropriate to use other available
data to examine the trends in disability for the older popula-
tion in recent years.
TRENDS IN DISABILITY S61
Data
This analysis will use two datasets: the NHIS, a repeated
cross-sectional sample that provides annual data on preva-
lence from large samples of older persons, and the LSOA, a
longitudinal sample that provides information on prevalence
at four dates and incidence during three intervals. This
combination of data provides a maximal number of data
points for observation of trends in both prevalence and
incidence.
The NHIS is a continuous household survey of the nonin-
stitutionalized population of all ages in the United States,
which has been ongoing since 1957 with the express purpose
of monitoring population health and health-care usage. Over
the years, the survey has been periodically modified to take
advantage of new approaches toward the measurement of
health and functioning. These modifications make analysis
of time trends across years of major survey redesign dif-
ficult. Such a redesign took place between 1981 and 1982.
Because the 1982 changes were particularly important in
redefining disability for those 70 and older, we examine
trends in disability among the population 70 years of age and
over for the years from 1982 through 1993 (actually, from
age 71 in 1982 and 70 in later years because of questionnaire
wording in 1982). The annual sample of persons 70 years of
age and over averages almost 9,000, providing a large
sample for relatively precise estimates for each year.
For older persons, disability in the NHIS is defined by
responses to general questions on needs for help with per-
sonal care and other routine needs. They can be viewed as
shorthand versions of questions eliciting (a) ADL disability
and (b) IADL disability without ADL disability. Respon-
dents indicate whether "any impairment or health problem
results in the need for help from another person with per-
sonal care needs, such as eating, bathing, dressing, or
getting around the house." If they have no personal care
needs, they are asked whether "health or impairment results
in a need for help from other persons in handling routine
needs, such as everyday household chores, doing necessary
business, shopping, or getting around for other purposes."
Our other dataset, the LSOA, began in 1984 as a supple-
ment to the NHIS. Those 70 years of age and over who
participated in the 1984 interview became the basis for a
longitudinal sample (N = 7,527). A subsample of the
original group (5,151) was eligible for reinterview in 1986,
1988, and 1990. Because of limited funding, the other 2,376
members of the original sample were eligible for follow-up
only in the 1988 and 1990 interviews. Further details on the
LSOA are provided in Kovar, Fitti, and Chyba (1992). We
use the sample of 5,151 respondents for the LSOA preva-
lence analysis and add the additional 2,376 for the transition
analysis.
For the LSOA analysis, disability in ADLs is defined as
being unable, because of health, to perform by oneself at
least one of five ADL activities (bathing, dressing, eating,
getting in and out of bed, toileting). IADL disability is an
inability to perform at least one of five activities: preparing a
meal, shopping for personal items, managing money, using
the telephone, doing light housework.
In the LSOA the classification of the disabled involves the
answers to two questions for each ADL and IADL function.
Respondents first answer a question worded as follows:
"Because of a health or physical problem, do you have any
difficulty (specific ADL or IADL)?" If the answer is "yes,"
the next question is, "By yourself (and without using special
equipment -- ADL only) how much difficulty do you have
(specific ADL or IADL)?" If the response is "unable to do"
for one ADL or IADL function, the person is classified as
disabled. In the analysis people are designated as having
ADL disability, IADL disability without ADL disability, or
not disabled.
Each of the three surveys, the NLTCS, the LSOA, and the
NHIS, measure disability in two conceptual domains: per-
sonal care and independent living. The operationalization in
individual surveys differs in the list of tasks included in each
domain and whether disability is defined in terms of need or
receipt of help, an inability to do a task alone, and how the
use of assistive devices is included. In addition, the NLTCS
includes a time dimension that limits disability to that of
three-months duration. Differences in the operationalization
of this measurement lead to different reported levels of
disability (Wiener et al., 1990); our expectation, however, is
that underlying trends should be evident with any of these
operational definitions.
To use the LSOA data to examine change over time, we
need to assure comparability of the LSOA results across
time. Because the initial LSOA sample does not include the
institutionalized population, we eliminate any institutional-
ized persons from the later prevalence figures and institu-
tionalized persons at the beginning of the interval for the
incidence comparisons. In the LSOA sample there is no
addition of younger sample members after the initial inter-
view; thus, the youngest sample members are age 76 in
1990, and we limit our analysis of the LSOA to those aged
76 through 96 at each wave.
Attrition in the LSOA, as in any longitudinal survey, must
be taken into account for any analysis of time change in
either prevalence or incidence. The percentage of the origi-
nal 5,151 respondents not responding at later waves was 7.7
in 1986, 10.5 in 1988, and 12.0 in 1990. We have used a
combination of imputation and weighting procedures to
adjust for sample attrition. We recognize that sample loss is
related to health status, and not correcting for it could affect
the observed levels of disability prevalence and incidence at
later waves. Therefore, we adjust for sample loss using
techniques that should result in sample outcomes reflecting
the incidence and prevalence of disability among the survi-
vors of the initial sample.
We begin treatment of missing cases by imputing disabil-
ity status for those assumed to be alive who had reported
disability status in two waves prior, two waves after, or two
waves surrounding the missing interview. Imputations of
disability state are made probabilistically based on observed
disability transition outcomes in datasets representing pat-
terns of disability across waves. About three-quarters of the
disability is adjusted for in this manner. The rest of the
attrition is adjusted for by using an adjustment to the original
sample weight based on the estimated probability of nonre-
sponse from a regression equation including age, race, sex,
education, living arrangements, and interval as the predic-
tors of nonresponse. Because of the structure of the analyses,
S62 CRIMMINS ET AL.
weights differ for the prevalence and incidence analysis.
Further details on the imputation and weighting procedures
are provided in Crimmins, Hayward, and Saito, 1994.
Results presented from the LSOA data were tested for
sensitivity to the analytic choices described above: the use of
weights adjusting for attrition, the age range of the included
sample (70+ or 76 + ), and the use of the 5,151 versus the
7,527 sample. Findings are very robust; none of these
choices significantly influences either the substantive or the
statistical conclusions. The findings are somewhat sensitive,
however, to the imputation for missing data, and this is
described later.
While the LSOA survey intervals are roughly two years in
length, corrections still need to be made for small differences
in actual interval length for the analysis of incidence of
disability and restoration of functioning. This is accom-
plished through the inclusion of exposure time in the hazard
models used in the analysis.
METHODS
Prevalence
The statistical significance of change over time in the
prevalence of disability is tested by examining the regression
coefficients indicating the time since the first observation in
analyses in which observations are pooled for the 12 dates
for the NHIS and for 4 dates for the LSOA. For the LSOA,
the wave of the survey is indicated using dummy variables
with the earliest year omitted as the reference category; for
the NHIS, years since 1982 is entered as a continuous
variable. In order to control for any compositional differ-
ences in the groups over time, age and sex are entered as
controls. For the LSOA, these regressions take the form:
In (P/(l-P)) = a0
+ a, Age + a2
Female
+ a3
Y1986 + a4
Y1988 + a5
Y1990.
For the NHIS, there is one time variable indicating the
number of years since 1982. In these analyses, P equals the
probability of being either ADL- or IADL-disabled versus
no disability. Age is the age at the beginning of the interval
in two-year age groups (76-96) for the LSOA and single
year of age for the NHIS.
In addition, a multinomial logistic regression analysis is
used to examine the prevalence of ADL and IADL disability
separately. For the LSOA, this equation takes the form
ln(P(Y=j)/P(Y = J)) = pjo
+ft,Age + pj2
Female
+ pj3
Y1986 + pj4
Y1988 + PJ5
Y1990
where Y is the outcome variable, J is the number of catego-
ries in the outcome variable (3 for this study, i.e., ADL
disability, IADL disability, and nondisabled), and j takes
values from 1 to J-1. The natural log of the odds of being in a
certain category relative to being in the reference category is
estimated in the analysis. In this study, the natural log of the
odds of having an ADL disability (P[Y =1]) relative to being
nondisabled (P[Y = 3]), and the natural log of the odds of
having an IADL disability but no ADL disability (P[Y = 2])
relative to being nondisabled (P[Y = 3]) are estimated simul-
taneously. Once the model is estimated, the predicted proba-
bility of being in a particular outcome state can be easily
computed (Roncek, 1991). Again, for the NHIS, there is one
time variable indicating the years since 1982.
Incidence of Disability and Transitions to Nondisability
Following the prevalence analysis using both datasets,
transitions of the following types are examined using the
LSOA: from "nondisability to disability," from "disability
to nondisability," and from the states of disability and
nondisability to death. Discrete-time hazards models assum-
ing mid-interval transitions which include age, sex, and
interval as the independent variables are employed to test the
significance of change over time in incidence of disability
and death and the restoration of ability to function. The
hazard models take the following form in this analysis:
Inn,
me luiiuwnig lunn in iiiia anaiy
ikl
(Age) = Ykl0
+ Ykll
Age + Ykl2
Female
+ Ykl3
1986-88 + Ykl4
1988-90
where hkl
is the transition rate from state k (e.g., nondisabled
or disabled) to state 1 (e.g., nondisabled, disabled, or
death). The interval of time to which the data refer is entered
as a dummy variable with the first interval (1984-1986)
omitted as the reference category.
RESULTS
Prevalence
The NHIS. -- The prevalence of personal care and routine
need disability for men and women in each year is presented
in Table 1. Graphs of the prevalence of both types of
disability for men and women in each of four age groups at
every year from 1982 to 1993 are shown in Figures 1 and 2.
A visual examination of the figures and table gives us an
indication of the consistency of these data and the fact that
there is no dramatic trend. Visual examination of the data
does not indicate any clear time trend in the need for personal
care or the percentage reporting a need for help with other
routine activities. In general, the percentage needing help
with routine needs is somewhat lower in the later years,
although the percentages needing help in 1993 are considera-
bly higher than in 1992. The percentage needing help with
personal care is somewhat lower in 1993 than in 1982, but if
the comparison were between 1982 and 1992 the percent-
ages would be virtually identical.
Statistical analysis, however, does indicate some signi-
ficant reductions in disability over time. In interpreting the
results, the large sample must be considered as well as
statistical significance. When age and sex are controlled,
there is a significantly lower relative likelihood of disability
in later years when the two types of disability are combined
(Table 2). When the two types of disability are separated,
there is a lower relative likelihood of each type of disability
in later years.
Using the results of the multinomial equations in Table 2,
the probability of needing help with personal care, needing
help with routine care, and of being nondisabled can be
estimated for each sample member based on age, sex, and
year of observation. In order to estimate the decrease in the
prevalence of disability that would have occurred if there
were no change in the composition of the sample but a linear

time trend in disability of the size represented by the coef-
ficient, we compare the average estimated probabilities for
1982 sample members for 1982 and 1993 to indicate the
projected effect of a linear time trend. The estimated proba-
bilities in each state are:

Personal care disabled
Routine care disabled

.789
.074

This projection indicates that the reduction in routine care
disability and the increase in the nondisabled would have
been 1.3 and 1.6 percent. While the decline in the relative
likelihood of personal care disability was statistically signi-
ficant, the predicted decline in the actual prevalence of this
disability was quite small.
TheLSOA. --The sex-specific prevalences of nondisabil-
ity and IADL and ADL disability for the LSOA sample 76 +
at each of the four dates are presented in Table 3. There
appears to be no consistent change in the prevalence of
disability over the four dates. The percent nondisabled
seems to decrease between 1984 and 1986 and to increase
slightly at the next two dates. Change in the components of
disability appears equally irregular. Age-specific curves of
the observed prevalence of IADL and ADL disability at the
four dates are shown in Figure 3. Again, visual analysis does
not indicate obvious consistent change over the period in the
prevalence of disability in any age range.
The results of the logistic regression, however, indicate
that the likelihoods of being disabled in 1986 and 1988 are
significantly different from that in 1984 (Table 4, left
column). The sign, however, is positive, indicating that
once age and sex are controlled the odds of being disabled
relative to nondisabled were significantly higher (by 20 and
15%) at these two dates. There is no significant difference
between 1990 and 1984 in the likelihood of being disabled at
the time of the interview.
When the disabled are divided into two categories --
those with an ADL disability and those with only IADL
disability -- the results indicate that the increased likelihood
of disability relative to nondisability described above for
1986 and 1988 is because of the increased likelihood of ADL
disability. At each of the three dates after the first interview,
the likelihood of having an ADL disability relative to being
nondisabled is significantly higher than in 1984. Using the
coefficients from Table 4 and the values of the independent
variables to predict the probability that any sample observa-
tion is ADL disabled, the average probability of haying an
ADL disability for the 1984 sample would have increased
between 1984 and 1990 by 1.6 percentage points.
There are no significant differences between 1984 and the
other years in the likelihood of IADL disability relative to
being nondisabled. Clearly, the analysis of time differences
is sensitive to the year used as the basis of comparison. If
difference relative to 1986 rather than 1984 is analyzed,
1990 IADL disability relative to nondisability is signifi-
cantly lower.
As mentioned earlier, our results are somewhat sensitive
to the imputation of missing data on disability status. This is
not surprising given that the primary reason for worrying
about sample attrition in this analysis is that unhealthy
people are lost to the sample more frequently than healthy
people; thus, attrition produces a healthier sample over time.
If we had not imputed disability status for missing cases, we
would not observe a significant increase from 1984 to 1988
in all disability; nor an increase in ADL disability between
1984 and 1988 or 1990- The significant increases between
1984 and 1986 are still found.

Trends in Incidence, Recovery, and Death Rates
The results of the analysis of the effect of time interval on
the rate of making transitions from ' 'nondisability to disabil-
ity," from "disability to nondisability," and from either
state to death are shown in Table 5. Coefficients on the
1988-1990 interval indicate that the rates of transition be-
tween the disabled and nondisabled states in 1988 to 1990
are significantly different from those in the 1984-1986
interval. The transition rates from "nondisability to disabil-
ity" are 16 percent lower in the 1988 to 1990 interval,
whereas the transition rates from "disability to nondisabil-
ity" are 43 percent higher in this interval. This can be
interpreted to mean that the rate of becoming disabled as
well as the rate of overcoming disability changed in the
direction of improving functioning among the older popula-
tion. The death rate from either state does not change
significantly over time. This is not surprising given the lack
of consistent change in national mortality rates among the
very old in the 1980s reported by the National Center for
Health Statistics (1991), and similar findings in the NLTCS
(Manton, Corder, and Stallard, 1993).
The meaning of the significant differences in the likeli-
hood of disability change can perhaps be best grasped from
age-specific disability transition schedules derived from the
hazard models for the two significantly different periods
(1984-1986 and 1988-1990). Estimated age-sex specific
transition rates from "nondisabled to disabled" and from
"disabled back to nondisabled" are shown in Figure 4. The
effect of the later time period on the transition rates is not
only statistically significant but noticeable in the figures. For
instance, at age 80-81 the rate of changing from "nondis-
abled to disabled" is .061 in the 1984-1986 interval and
.051 in the 1988-1990 interval for males and .076 and .064
for females in the two intervals. The relative change in the
rate of moving from the disabled state is even greater. At age
80-81 the rate of making such a change during the 1984--
1986 interval was .083 for males. In the 1988-1990 interval,
the same rate was .120. The curves are uniformly different
across ages because we did not incorporate interactions
between age and time into our models.
The results on time differences in disability onset and
recovery in Table 5 are not sensitive to the imputation
procedure. However, the time pattern of differences in death
rates is affected by imputation. If we did not impute, we
would observe higher death rates for the disabled in the
1986-1988 period than in the 1984-1986 period.
DISCUSSION
What evidence is there for a change in the prevalence of
disability during recent years? We conclude that although
the data indicate some statistically significant differences
between years, there is no clear ongoing trend in the preva-

lence of disability among older Americans in the latter part
of the 1980s and the early 1990s. Our findings from the
NHIS are quite similar to those from the NLTCS, indicating
a statistically significant decrease in overall disability in later
years arising primarily from a decrease in IADL disability.
The estimated size of the effects is quite similar from these
two surveys; however, the use of the NHIS indicates that the
change does not arise from a clear time trend. With a sample
as large as the NHIS, an ongoing time trend should be more
evident in the data.
The LSOA provides quite different results from the other
two surveys: an increase in ADL disability between 1984
and 1986 and 1988 and no change in IADL disability. If we
used 1986 as the reference year, the findings would be quite
different and very similar to those from the NLTCS: a
significant decrease in overall disability between 1986 and
1990, no change in ADL disability, and a significant de-
crease in IADL disability. In the NHIS, we could also find
somewhat different results by varying the base year. The
relationship of the significance of change to the base year
points out the importance of having multiple points of
observation over which to examine change. A more regular
time change in any of the datasets would provide stronger
evidence of a trend.
Is there evidence of changing incidence of disability and
restoration of functioning during the 1980s? Both the LSOA
and the NLTCS datasets indicate significant declines in the
level of onset of disability. We find evidence of significant
decrease in the most recent years (1988-1990) in the LSOA.
The size of the reported reduction appears to be of the same
order of magnitude in the two datasets. In the NLTCS data
there was a 31 percent reduction in the two-year transition
probability from nondisabled to disabled for 75- to 84-year-
olds (Manton, Corder, and Stallard, 1993, calculated from
Table 3). In the LSOA we observe a reduction of 16 percent
in the estimated one-year transition rate of the same type.

The results from the LSOA provide stronger evidence of
favorable change in disability transitions over the 1980s.
There was an increased likelihood of recovering from dis-
ability at the end of the 1984-1990 period in the LSOA but a
decrease in this likelihood in the NLTCS. Precise compari-
sons of the size of the change in the likelihood of going from
disabled to nondisabled cannot be made for the two datasets,
but both appear to be proportionately quite large.
The lack of immediate translation of incidence changes
into prevalence differences, as observed in the LSOA, is not
unexpected (Crimmins, Hayward, and Saito, 1994). If the
healthier incidence rates of the 1988-1990 period observed
in the LSOA were sustained for some years, the prevalence
of disability should decrease as well. The similarity of the
recent incident changes from "nondisabled to disabled"
from the two surveys with incident information provides the
first replicated evidence that we are potentially at the begin-
ning of a period of improvement in disability among the old.
Evidence of sustained change beyond 1990 is needed before
we can confidently say that improvement has begun.
Differences in the findings across datasets collected to
monitor changes in disability in old age in the 1980s indicate
a need for further evidence before drawing conclusions
about clear trends toward improving health among the older
population. The differences in results from the three studies
could reflect numerous design differences in the NHIS, the
NLTCS, and the LSOA. We will not discuss these differ-
ences in detail because this has been done extensively by
others (Corder and Manton, 1991; Wiener et al., 1990), but
potential sources of varying results'include: coverage of the
institutional and nondisabled populations, reinterview ver-
sus new sample, sample size, age coverage, sampling com-
plexity, survey interval, mode of interview on some waves,
the use of a sample screen, the frequency of proxy response,
and the format and content of the questions used to define the
disabled.
Some differences do not affect our comparisons because
we limit the comparisons to samples with similar character-
istics (e.g., coverage of institutional population) or if we did
limit the analysis to comparative groups the results would
not change (e.g., age restricted to the 75 plus). Other
differences could cause variable results. For instance, differ-
ent definitions of ADL and IADL disability could be a cause
of differences in findings between the two surveys.
The most dramatic difference across surveys is in the
findings about trends in ADL disability prevalence. This
may also be the place where the difference in definition is
greatest. Both the NHIS and the NLTCS use "needing" or
"getting personal assistance" in performing tasks as central
to the definition of ADL disability. In the LSOA, if we were
to include those among the "ADL-disabled" who receive
assistance but report themselves physically able to perform
functions, the prevalence of ADL disability would increase
by 83 percent in the 1984 LSOA sample.
While the receipt of assistance is commonly used as an
indicator of old age disability, we think that this is not a good
practice. One of the major problems with these definitions is
that the receipt of assistance is highly related to living
arrangements. Those who live with others are more likely to
get assistance. If we employed the use-of-assistance defini-
tion with the LSOA sample, among those who live with
others, the increase in ADL disability would be 101 percent;
among those who live alone, the increase would be only 27
percent. We think that disability is better measured by
functioning deficits due to health than by the use of assis-
tance in the older population.
Any explanation of the finding from the NHIS and the
NLTCS of a decrease in IADL disability and not ADL
disability needs to be evaluated in light of what might affect
IADL ability but not ADL ability. Verbrugge and Jette
(1994) have cogently clarified the role that health and envi-
ronment potentially play in various types of disabilities.
IADL disability which arises from difficulty doing house-
work, meal preparation, shopping, other household chores,
and getting around outside the house can be affected by the
ability to drive, the provision of transportation services, the
availability of prepared foods and microwave ovens, as well
as other factors that are not related to the intrinsic health
status of a population. ADL ability represents more basic
ability and is less likely to be affected by factors extrinsic to
the individual.
While we have examined changes in the age-specific
prevalence of disability, we have not discussed the burden of
disability on those who are preparing for the aging of the
population in the next century. The dramatic increase in the
numbers of older persons results in a predicted increase in
the burden of disability in the population even when the most
optimistic projections of current findings are employed.
However, reducing the incidence of disability or raising the
age at which people become disabled is the most effective
mechanism for reducing the future numbers of disabled in
the population (Crimmins, Hayward, and Saito, 1994).
Because of this, public policies should be directed toward
the prevention and delay of onset of disabling diseases and
conditions and in the provision of technology and services to
compensate for disability.
