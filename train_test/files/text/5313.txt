Introduction
Cancer is infamous as the leading cause of death in the
world. In the United States, breast cancer is the most com-
mon type of cancer for women.1 In addition, the majority of
breast cancer deaths are mainly because of cancer metasta-
sis to other parts of the body.2 For years, research into a cure
for cancer has been ongoing, and inhibition of the meta-
static cascade is one of the goals. The association of func-
tional foods, such as probiotics, with cancer therapy has
become an emerging field of study. Although the use of pro-
biotics as a therapeutic agent is most common in colon-
related diseases3,4 because the bacteria can interact directly
with the colon after consumption, probiotics also demon-
strate antitumor properties in breast cancer cells.5
Kefir was introduced more than a thousand years ago in
the Caucasus Mountains in Central Asia. It is a traditional
beverage made from the fermentation of kefir grains with
milk or water.6 Kefir grains contain various kinds of micro-
bial flora, including the most commonly studied species
with probiotic potential such as Lactobacillus acidophilus,
Lactobacillus casei, and Lactococcus lactis subsp Lactis.7,8
Because these species have numerous different strains, not

Abstract
Background. Kefir is a unique cultured product that contains beneficial probiotics. Kefir culture from other parts of the world
exhibits numerous beneficial qualities such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulation, and anticancer effects. Nevertheless,
kefir cultures from different parts of the world exert different effects because of variation in culture conditions and media.
Breast cancer is the leading cancer in women, and metastasis is the major cause of death associated with breast cancer.
The antimetastatic and antiangiogenic effects of kefir water made from kefir grains cultured in Malaysia were studied in 4T1
breast cancer cells. Methods. 4T1 cancer cells were treated with kefir water in vitro to assess its antimigration and anti-
invasion effects. BALB/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and treated orally with kefir water for 28 days. Results.
Kefir water was cytotoxic toward 4T1 cells at IC
50
(half-maximal inhibitory concentration) of 12.5 and 8.33 mg/mL for 48
and 72 hours, respectively. A significant reduction in tumor size and weight (0.9132 ± 0.219 g) and a substantial increase
in helper T cells (5-fold) and cytotoxic T cells (7-fold) were observed in the kefir water­treated group. Proinflammatory
and proangiogenic markers were significantly reduced in the kefir water­treated group. Conclusions. Kefir water inhibited
tumor proliferation in vitro and in vivo mainly through cancer cell apoptosis, immunomodulation by stimulating T helper
cells and cytotoxic T cells, and anti-inflammatory, antimetastatic, and antiangiogenesis effects. This study brought out the
potential of the probiotic beverage kefir water in cancer treatment.

every single strain has the potential to be probiotic. This
important characteristic makes kefir suitable as a probiotic
beverage. Probiotics refer to live microorganisms, which
when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health ben-
efit on the host.9 Kefir has been consumed extensively for
years because it is believed to promote good health. This
claim was verified by recent studies, which showed that kefir
can aid in alleviating lactose intolerance,10 inflammation,11,12
and high total cholesterol13,14 as well as exhibiting immuno-
modulation properties.15 It has also been reported that kefir
has the ability to induce cytotoxicity and reduce cancer
growth in vivo.5,16
Furthermore, studies by de Moreno de LeBlanc etal5,17
on the administration of commercial milk kefir from Canada
in a breast cancer murine model determined that it can slow
down cancer by elevating local immune response and
selected cytokines. Nevertheless, an in-depth study is
needed on the antitumor and antimetastatic effects of kefir
in a murine breast cancer model. Thus, this study focused
on the antimetastatic effects of kefir water made from kefir
grains grown in Malaysia on 4T1 cells in in vitro and in
vivo murine models.
Material and Methods
Sample Preparation
Kefir grain was obtained from a local store in Kuala Lumpur
(http://mykefirworld.com/); 200 mg of kefir grain was
added into a glass vessel containing brown sugar (200 g)
dissolved in 1.5 L of mineral water. The fermentation was
performed for 24 hours at room temperature. After that, the
grain was filtered out from the fermented medium, and the
kefir water was freeze dried. Dried kefir water was diluted
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 500 mg/mL) and stored
at 4°C until used.
Animal and Experimental Groups
Female BALB/c mice at the age of 5 to 6 weeks (20-22 g)
were obtained from the Animal House of Univesiti Putra
Malaysia, Serdang (UPM, Malaysia). The mice were sepa-
rated into 3 groups (n = 7 for each group): (1) normal group;
(2) untreated tumor group, in which mice were fed orally
with distilled water; and (3) kefir water­treated group, in
which mice with tumor were fed orally with kefir water (150
mg/kg body weight per day). Kefir dosage was determined
based on previous studies.16,18,19 All mice in the tumor group
were inoculated with 1 × 105 4T1 cells subcutaneously, and
treatment was administered orally with samples on the same
day of tumor inoculation for 28 days. The mice were main-
tained under standard animal house conditions, with a regu-
lar 12-hour dark-light cycle at 25°C. Water and standard diet
pellet were provided ad libitum. All the experiments using
animals were performed under the ethical guidelines set by
Universiti Putra Malaysia for the care of lab animals (UPM/
IACUC/AUP-R042/2015).
TUNEL Assay
The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferased UTP nick end-
labeling (TUNEL) DNA fragmentation assay was carried
out according to the user's guidelines in DeadEnd colori-
metric TUNEL assay protocol (Promega, USA). Briefly,
tumor tissue sections from untreated and kefir water­treated
groups on microscope slides were deparaffinized in xylene
for 5 minutes. Then, the slides were immersed in sequential
concentrations of ethanol (100%, 95%, 85%, 70%, and
50%) and in 0.85% NaCl for 5 minutes. Next, the slides
were immersed in PBS (pH 7.0) before they were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes. The slides were
washed with PBS, and the tissues were permeabilized with
the provided proteinase K. The fixing steps were repeated
before the tissues were equilibrated using an equilibrium
buffer. Then, the tissue sections were labeled with terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase and blocked in hydrogen per-
oxide. The slides were incubated in streptavidin-horserad-
ish peroxidase (HRP) and developed using 3,
3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate. Finally, the slides
were mounted and viewed under bright field microscopy
(Motic, Hong Kong), and the apoptotic cells were counted
from 5 different fields in every tumor slide (n = 7 per group).
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) Staining
The tumor tissues from untreated and kefir water­treated
groups were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in
paraffin, and sectioned. The sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin and viewed under bright field
microscopy (Motic, Hong Kong) for mitotic cell identifica-
tions. The mitotic cells were counted from 5 different fields
in every tumor slide (n = 7 per group).
Nitric Oxide Assay
NO in tumor samples from untreated and kefir water­
treated groups was measured according to the user's guide-
lines in the Griess reagent kit (Sigma, USA). Tumors were
meshed using a plunger and a 70-µm cell strainer in PBS.
The supernatants were collected and mixed with the pro-
vided Griess Reagent and deionized water. After the sample
mixtures were incubated for 30 minutes, the absorbance
was measured using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek
Instruments, Winooska, VT) at 548 nm.
Malondialdehyde (MDA) Assay
The level of lipid peroxidation in tumor samples from
untreated and kefir water­treated groups was measured
using the MDA assay by thiobarbituric acid reaction,
Zamberi et al NP55
according to Ohkawa etal.20 Tumors were meshed using a
70-µm cell strainer in PBS. The supernatants were collected
and mixed with butylated hydroxytoluene (Sigma, USA)
and 2,4,6-trichloroanisole before they were vortexed and
kept on ice for 2 hours. Afterward, the mixtures were centri-
fuged, and the supernatants were mixed with thiobarbituric
acid and boiled for 15 minutes. The absorbance of the mix-
tures was measured at 532 nm using a spectrophotometer
(Beckman Coulter, USA). Tetramethoxypropan (Sigma,
USA) was used as standard.
Serum Cytokine Detection of Interleukin 2 (IL-
2), IL-1, IL-10, and Interferon  (IFN-)
Blood serum was collected from normal, untreated, and
kefir water­treated groups and subjected to cytokine detec-
tion using a Duoset ELISA assay kit (R&D Systems, USA;
catalog no: DY401, DY485, DY417, DY402) per the user's
guidelines. The assay plate was coated with capture anti-
body overnight. The plate was washed with PBS 0.5%
Tween 20 and incubated with block buffer followed by
serum samples for 2 hours. Next, the plate was washed
again and incubated with detection antibody for 2 hours.
Streptavidin-HRP was added to the plate for 20 minutes
after the plate was washed. Then, the plate was incubated
with substrate solution for 20 minutes and the reaction was
ended with the addition of stop solution. The absorbance
was measured using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek
Instruments, Winooska, VT) at 450 nm.
Immunophenotyping
Immunophenotyping of spleen CD3, CD4, and CD8 were
done based on Yeap etal.21 Briefly, the harvested spleens
from normal, untreated, and kefir water­treated groups
were meshed, and red blood cells were lysed using lysis
buffer (8 g NH
4
Cl, 1 g Na
2
EDTA, 0.1 g KH
2
PO
4
at pH 7.4).
The cells were washed with PBS and stained with the CD3,
CD4, and CD8 antibodies (Abcam, USA; Catalog No:
ab11089, ab25475, ab22378) for 2 hours. The cells were
then washed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for a week, and
run through a FACS-Calibur flow cytometry system (BD,
USA).
Lung Clonogenic Assay
Clonogenic assay was performed to determine the number
of metastatic 4T1 cells in the lung.22 The harvested lungs
from untreated and kefir water­treated groups were washed
with PBS, minced into small pieces, and subjected to diges-
tion in 2 mg/mL collagenase type IV for 1 hour in a 37°C
water bath. The digested lungs were meshed and filtered
through 70-µm strainers using syringe plungers. Then, the
digested lungs were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes
and washed twice with PBS. The cell pellets were resus-
pended in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI)
containing 60-µm 6-thioguanine for clonogenic growth.
The suspensions were serially diluted in 6-well plates. After
10 days, the clonogenic cells were fixed in methanol and
stained with 0.5% crystal violet. Clonogenic cells were
counted for each group.
Bone Marrow Smearing
Femurs from untreated and kefir water­treated mice were
harvested; the bone marrows were located and washed out
with PBS. The bone marrow solution was dropped onto
clean glass slides and smeared across the slide. After the
slides dried, they were fixed in methanol for 30 minutes and
stained with Giemsa for 2 hours. The slides were viewed
under an inverted microscope (Nikon, Japan).
Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain
Reaction (qPCR)
Tumors from untreated and kefir water­treated groups were
snap frozen with liquid nitrogen and ground using a mortar
and pestle. Total RNA was extracted from the ground sam-
ples using the Qiagen RNEasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany).
The RNA (1 µg) obtained was converted into cDNA using
Maxima First Strand cDNAsynthesis kit (Thermo Scientific,
USA) and loaded into a thermal cycler (Labnet, USA). The
cDNAwas subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction
using SYBR Select Master Mix (Life Technologies, USA)
in Eco Illumina (Illumina, USA) to quantify gene expres-
sion of the selected genes described in Table 1. The primers
were obtained from Primer-Blast NCBI (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/) and Primer Bank (http://
pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/). GAPDH and ACTB
were used as housekeeping genes. The expressions were
analyzed using Eco Study (Illumina, USA).
Proteome Profiler Angiogenesis Antibody Array
The detection of multiple cytokines in protein samples was
done using the Mouse Angiogenesis Antibody Array kit
(Ray Biotech, USA). The proteins from tumors harvested
from untreated and kefir water­treated groups were
extracted from ground samples using QIAShredder (Qiagen,
Germany) and RIPA-Protease Inhibitor buffer (50 mM Tris-
HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% TritonX-100, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, Protease inhibitor [Roche,
USA]). Then, the protein samples were subjected to the pro-
tein array per the user's guidelines. In brief, the provided
glass chip was blocked using blocking buffer for 30 min-
utes, and samples were incubated in the chip overnight at
4°C. After 24 hours, the chip was washed 3 times with
selected wash buffer. The chip was then incubated with
NP56 Integrative Cancer Therapies 15(4)
biotin-conjugated anticytokine reagent for 2 hours and with
streptavidin-fluor for 2 more hours. The chip was washed
twice with selected wash buffer and distilled water. The
chip was allowed to dry and scanned using the Axon Gene
Pix 4000B (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and the
values were extracted using the Axon Gene Pix Pro 6.1
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale) software. The data were
then analyzed based on calculations provided in the user's
guidelines.
Statistical Analysis
Unless stated otherwise, the results were expressed as the
means and SDs of all mice for each group (n = 7 for each
group). Statistical significance (P < 0.05) was determined
using Student's t-tests and performed using GraphPad
Prism (version 6.0) against the untreated group.
Results
Kefir Water Induced Cell Cytotoxicity and
Positively Suppressed Cell Migration and
Invasion In Vitro
MTT assay was performed on 4T1 cells to evaluate the cyto-
toxicity of the kefir water at the highest dosage of 50 mg/mL.
The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
50
) values were
determined and selected for further bioassays. The IC
50
values
after 48 hours and 72 hours were 12.5 and 8.33 mg/mL,
respectively. The migration and invasion ability of 4T1 cells
were challenged with the exposure to 3 concentrations of kefir
water at 3.125, 6.25, and 12.5 mg/mL through a Matrigel
membrane. The number of migrating cells was significantly
decreased in the treatment groups as compared with the
untreated group (supplementary data, available at http://ict.
sagepub.com/supplemental). The percentage of migrating
cells was reduced by 88.03% ± 1.44% when treated with 12.5
mg/mL kefir water. The same pattern can be observed in the
invasion assay, where the invaded cells were reduced in num-
ber when exposed to higher concentration of kefir water, with
72.83% ± 4.01% of cell invasion being suppressed at 12.5 mg/
mL. Hence, it can be concluded that the rate of 4T1 cell migra-
tion and invasion was dose dependent, whereby as the con-
centration of kefir water increased, the rate decreased. In the
wound healing assay, a significant reduction in wound healing
in comparison to untreated cells was observed at 3 concentra-
tions of kefir water (3.12, 6.25, and 12.5 mg/mL) at 12 and 24
hours (supplementary data, available at http://ict.sagepub.
com/supplemental). The wound closures between the 3 con-
centrations were distinguishable only at 24 hours, where the
percentages were 67.9%, 62.5%, and 39.6%, at the respective
ascending concentrations.
Kefir Water Obstructed Ex Vivo Angiogenesis in
Mouse Aortic Ring
Sections of mouse aortic rings were embedded in Matrigel and
exposed to 12.5 mg/mLof kefir water for 10 days to allow ves-
sels to grow. The formation of microvessels sprouting from the
aortas was observed and counted in every well. As compared

with the untreated aortas, the aortas in the kefir water­treated
group produced minimal microvessel growth (supplementary
data, available at http://ict.sagepub.com/supplemental).
Kefir Water Reduced 4T1 Tumor Growth in
Mice
Figure 1A shows the image of tumor harvested from cancer
mice after 28 days of treatment. Tumor size in kefir water­
treated mice was smaller than that in untreated mice. The
tumor weight and volume were also reduced significantly
by 29.53% and 32.92%, respectively, in kefir water­treated
mice as compared with the untreated mice (Figure 1).
Kefir Water Inhibited Cell Mitosis and Enhanced
Tumor Apoptosis in Mice
Tumor sections were paraffin embedded on glass slides and
subjected to H&E staining and TUNEL assay. The histology
analysis of untreated tumor sections displayed a greater
number of differentiated cancer cells (Figure 2A). Black
circles in Figure 2Aindicate mitotic cells that underwent cell
division. Apoptosis of cancer cells in tumor was observed in
the TUNEL assay. A higher number of apoptotic cancer cells
were observed in the kefir water­treated tumor section as
compared with the untreated section (Figure 2B).
Kefir Water Decreased Metastasis to Lung and
Bone Marrow
The antimetastatic effects of kefir water on tumor were fur-
ther analyzed in a clonogenic assay and bone marrow­
smearing assay. In the clonogenic assay, 6-thioguanine is a
selective medium to grow 4T1 cells. The metastatic poten-
tial of 4T1 cells to the lung was observed after 10 days. The
number of 4T1 cells metastasized in the lung of kefir water­
treated mice was significantly lower than in untreated mice,
as shown in Figure 3A. In the bone marrow­smearing assay,
metastatic cells were identified by the presence of large and
abnormal cells. Based on Figure 3B, metastatic 4T1 cells
were only observed in the untreated group.
Kefir Water­Controlled Cytokine Expressions in
Serum
The expression levels of cytokines involved in angiogenesis
and inflammation were measured using blood serum. The lev-
els of tumor pro-growth-related cytokines (IL-10 and IL-1)

were significantly decreased in the kefir water­treated group
(Figure 4). On the other hand, the levels of immunomodulation
related cytokines (IFN- and IL-2) were significantly
increased in the kefir water­treated group (Figure 4).

Kefir Water Enhanced Immune Response in Spleen
The population of selected immune markers (T-helper CD4+/
CD3+) and cytotoxic T cells (CD8+/CD3+) was calculated
based on immunophenotyping by flow cytometry. As shown
in Figure 5, the population of T-helper CD4 cells in the kefir
water­treated group as compared with the untreated group
was significantly higher, by 5-fold. The same pattern was
observed in the population of cytotoxic CD8 T cells, where it
was increased by 7-fold. In addition, the population of the
immune cells between the normal group and the kefir water­
treated group showed no statistical difference.
Kefir Water Decreased Lipid Peroxidation and
NO Levels in Tumor
The levels of lipid peroxidation of MDA and NO in tumor
supernatant were determined, and reductions were seen in both
assays (Figure 6). Kefir water had decreased the levels of both
inflammation-related chemicals in the tumors by about 3-fold.
Kefir Water Reduced the Expression of
Inflammation and Metastatic-Related Genes and
Proteins In Vivo
The mRNA expressions of ICAM, iNOS, MMP-9, IL-1,
NF-B, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-4, and TNF- genes were
downregulated in the kefir water­treated group as com-
pared with the untreated group (Figure 7A). A significant
downregulation of iNOS and IL-1 by 3-fold were observed
in the kefir water­treated group. In the angiogenesis pro-
teome profiler assay, the levels of selected proangiogenesis
proteins were downregulated and that of antiangiogenesis
proteins were upregulated in the kefir water­treated group
(Figure 7B).
Discussion
Extensive research has been done to tackle breast cancer pro-
gression, but complete understanding is still a long way off.
Diet is one of the factors that leads to cancer development,

and the association between diet and cancer is currently being
investigated. Scientists have found that the occurrence of
tumors in animals can be manipulated by their diet intake.23
A study on milk kefir provides an insight into its antiprolif-
erative effects on breast cancer cells in vitro.24 Although kefir
has been commercialized in some places in the world, the
mechanism of action behind the anticancer claim of kefir,
especially kefir water, is still underresearched. Therefore, this
study was carried out to further investigate the anti-metasta-
sis and antiangiogenesis potential of kefir from Malaysia in
triple negative 4T1 murine breast cancer cells. Triple nega-
tive breast cancer (TNBC) is known to have poor prognosis
and highly metastasis compared to other breast cancer types.
Women with TNBC developed a significantly higher visceral
metastasis as the first site of distant recurrence than women
with other breast cancer types.25 Other than that, the develop-
ment of brain metastases is higher in the triple-negative phe-
notype compared with other types of breast cancer.26
Kefir water showed cytotoxicity toward 4T1 cells in the
MTT assay, and the IC
50
obtained was used in subsequent in
vitro migration assays. The significant reduction in cell
migration and invasion in kefir water­treated cells in vitro
demonstrated the potency of kefir water as an antimetasta-
sis agent. Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood ves-
sels from existing vessels, and it has an important role in
wound healing and development of tumors.27 This feature is
stimulated by proangiogenic factors, which are essential for
tumor metastasis.28 The ability of kefir water to inhibit
angiogenesis was shown in the ex vivo mouse aortic ring
assay, where lower microvessel growth was significantly
observed in treated aortas (supplementary data, available at
http://ict.sagepub.com/supplemental).
The effectiveness of kefir water in the inhibition of
breast cancer metastasis was further tested in an in vivo
model using BALB/c mice. After 28 days of treatment, the
size and weight of tumors in the kefir water­treated mice
were reduced significantly. Normal cell growth and prolif-
eration are regulated within the cell cycle. Cancer cells
divide rapidly because they deregulate the cell cycle signal
and, thus, proliferate at their own pace.28 Dividing cells in
tumor sections were analyzed using H&E staining, and as
can be seen in Figure 2A, the number of dividing cells was
reduced in the kefir water­treated tumor section. TUNEL
assay was performed on tumor tissue sections to detect
DNA damage. An increase in DNA fragmentation was
observed in kefir water­treated tumor sections in the
TUNEL assay. DNA fragmentation is one of the indicators
for cell apoptosis.29 Therefore, the increase in DNA frag-
mentation indicated that the tumor cells were undergoing
apoptosis.
The correlation between inflammation and cancer pro-
gression has been discussed for centuries. The chronic
inflammatory conditions that correlate with infection and
irritation may prompt genomic lesions and tumor initiation.30
Reports have found that breast cancer patients exhibit ele-
vated lipid peroxidation marker, MDA,31 and inflammatory
mediator, NO.32 In this study, kefir water successfully
reduced the levels of MDA and NO in kefir water­treated

mice. The decrease in NO was associated with significant
downregulation of iNOS in the kefir water­treated group
(Figure 7A). The overexpression of iNOS is highly corre-
lated with tumor progression and angiogenesis ability.33
The activation of NF-, which follows infectious agents or
cytokines such as TNF-, regulates the inflammatory
response of iNOS and also ICAM-1, an adhesion molecule
closely related to metastasis.34,35 Therefore, the reduction of
these proinflammatory genes will help in providing a micro-
environment that disfavors tumor growth.
The suppression of IL-2 and IFN-, which were gener-
ated by T-helper 1, are common in the case of chronic infec-
tious diseases.35 The effects of kefir water in the regulation
of IL-2 and IFN- cytokines were also analyzed, and the
kefir water­treated group showed increments in both cyto-
kines. IL-2 is a product of activated CD4+ T cells and CD8+
T cells.36 Furthermore, IFN- is known to increase the pro-
duction of major histocompatibility complex and obstructs
tumor angiogenesis.35 This antitumor immunity stimulation
was validated by the in immunophenotyping assay, where
notably increased numbers of immune markers (CD4+/
CD3+, CD8+/CD3+) were observed in the kefir water­
treated group (Figure 5). In fact, kefir has also been reported
to exert immunomodulating effects, when IgA+ and IgG+
were increased in the healthy treatment group.37 Both CD4
helper T cells and CD8 cytotoxic T cells are highly impor-
tant in immune response and producing antitumor response.38
The inability of the immune system to eradicate tumors was
mainly a result of the immunosuppressive environment pro-
duced by the developing tumor. The tumor suppressed both
T cell populations in the untreated group as compared with
the normal group and kefir water­treated group (Figure 5).
However, this observation was dissimilar to that in a previ-
ous kefir study.17 IL-4 and IL-10 are some of the Th2 cyto-
kines that are formed in a COX-2 expressing environment,
and these cytokines are able to obstruct the production of
Th-1 cytokines by CD4+ T helper lymphocytes.35 Astudy by
Sharma etal39 on the Lewis lung tumors in mice suggested
that the overexpression of IL-10 decreased the cytolytic
activity of CD8+. A similar outcome was observed in a
study by Jarnicki etal40 in which a corresponding increase
in IL-10 diminished cytotoxic T cell responses and IFN-
secreting T cells during tumor growth. An increase of IL-10
expression and reduction in the CD8+ population were
observed in the untreated group when compared with the
kefir water­treated group.
The role of kefir water as an antiangiogenic agent in
breast cancer was further investigated through the expres-
sion of several angiogenesis-related cytokines, genes, and
proteins. For tumor growth to obtain the capability to acti-
vate angiogenesis, it requires an angiogenic switch.41 The
angiogenic factors of IL-1 that encourage tumor invasive-
ness were observed in various experimental models.42,43 In
the cytokine and gene expression assay, kefir water signifi-
cantly reduced the level of IL-1 in the tumor environment.
Furthermore, kefir water also inhibited the level of IL-10
cytokine, which is associated with poor prognosis.44
Growth factors cause tumors to develop and migrate.
Some important hematopoietic growth factors studied in
this experiment included vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF),
and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor
(GM-CSF). The expression of VEGF is an essential media-
tor for angiogenesis, and it is abundant in many types of
cancer malignancies, especially in breast cancer.45,46 In
addition, the activation of VEGF promotes the growth of
endothelial cells and migration.47 G-CSF was identified as a
macrophage regulator to promote proliferation, differentia-
tion, and survival.48 However, G-CSF along with GM-CSF
can also act as proto-oncogenes, in which they are highly
expressed in various tumors49-51 and also frequently found
in invasive breast cancer cells.52 They were also found in
abundance in the cytokine profile of metastatic 4T1

tumors.53 The levels of VEGF, G-CSF, and GM-CSF were
significantly downregulated in the kefir water­treated
group proteome profiler as compared with the untreated
group. In addition, kefir water reduced the expression level
of eotaxin, which is a member of the CC chemokine family.
Chemokines are involved in the angiogenesis process by
stimulating proangiogenic immune cells or by activating G
protein­coupled chemokine receptors, which affect the tis-
sue microenvironments.54
The disruption and deregulation of the extracellular
matrix (ECM) often leads to cancer progression. In chronic
diseases, the disruption and remodeling of ECM by matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) will affect several attributes of
the cancer cells, such as the invasiveness, and metastatic
and angiogenesis potentials.55 MMP-9 is one of the impor-
tant players in the MMP family, promoting vascular events
in tumors as well as stimulating VEGF.56 Tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinases (TIMPs) is an endogenous inhibitor that
regulates the activities of MMP-9 in cancer cells.55 Keeping
the level of MMP-9 and TIMPs in check is important in
reducing angiogenesis in cancer cells. MMP-9 expression is
commonly abundant in metastatic breast cancer cells.57 On
the other hand, the increase in TIMPs such as TIMP-1 and
TIMP-2 in the tumor microenvironment can kill cancer
cells and reduce cancer proliferation.58 The balance between
the downregulation of MMP-9 and upregulation of TIMP-1

and TIMP-2 were demonstrated in the kefir water­treated
group, and this equilibrium was important in reducing can-
cer. This antiangiogenic potential of kefir water was vali-
dated with lung clonogenic and bone marrow smearing
assays, where significantly fewer 4T1 cells were observed
in the lung of the kefir water­treated mice, and no abnormal
cells were found in the bone marrow of the kefir water­
treated mice. The immunomodulation potential of kefir
water, which aids in inhibiting tumor cell growth has also
been observed in other studies using murine models of
breast cancers and sarcomas, whereby tumor growth was
inhibited by enhancing the local immune system response
and by increasing the total IgA level.5,59
The constituents of kefir that could have antitumor prop-
erties are mostly the polysaccharide and exopolysaccha-
rides isolated from kefir grains as well as components
released during fermentation, as suggested by previous
studies.11,16,60 Interestingly, we have detected gallic acid as
the major phenolic acid in the kefir water (result not shown).
The antitumor effects and cytotoxicity of gallic acid extracts
on many cell lines have been extensively observed over the
years.61 Thus, further studies on kefir water should include
the effects of antitumor and immunomodulation activity of
the gallic acid detected in kefir water.
Conclusion
In this study, kefir water was able to reduce 4T1 cell prolif-
eration, migration, and invasion in vitro. An ex vivo angio-
genesis assay was also performed, and kefir water showed
positive results in inhibiting angiogenesis. In addition,
kefir water exhibited antimetastatic and antiangiogenesis
effects in 4T1 cell­challenged mice in vivo through reduc-
ing 4T1 cell mitosis, promoting apoptosis, modulating
immune systems, inhibiting inflammation in the tumor
microenvironment, and regulating angiogenesis-related
proteins and genes. Thus, these findings are crucial in pro-
moting kefir water as part of the diet intake for cancer
patients.
