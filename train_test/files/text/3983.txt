Introduction
The European Union (EU) is enlarging to the Western
Balkans in the coming years. To become an EU member, the
candidate countries must agree to certain values and princi-
ples regarding health systems, for example, the main focus
should be put on primary health care (Council of the EU,
2007). The countries must also commit themselves to the
European policies and strategies for enhancing population
health, for instance, the "Europe 2020" strategy (European
Commission, 2015). In 2009, Serbia applied officially for
EU membership, and in 2012, the country was granted a can-
didate status. Negotiations for membership began in January
2014 (European Commission, 2014).
To commit to the context of EU integration and its common
values and principles, Serbia reformed its health care sector
after the overthrow of the Yugoslavian government in 2000
(Simic, Marinkovic, & Boulton, 2012). Some of the challenges
Serbia faces after the reform are (a) high referral rates from
general practitioners to specialists, (b) a perception that special-
ists provide high quality care (World Health Organization
[WHO], 2010), (c) weak contributions to the Health Insurance
Fund by public enterprises experiencing economic difficulties,
and (d) a deficit in funding for the health system (Simic et al.,
2012). The poor funding has lowered the quality of services,
creating long waiting lists and lowering the quality of health
care equipment and facilities (Karajicic & Muzik, 2014). In
addition, the primary care system suffers from inadequate skills
and competencies and the low economic and social status of
health professionals (Simic et al., 2012).
The services of general practitioners are often seen as
obsolete, and when they provide easy access to specialists, it
is perceived as high quality health care (Simic et al., 2012).
Because general practitioners are the gatekeepers to special-
ists or secondary care, informal payments may exist to facili-
tate access to these services (Simic et al., 2012). Today, the
health care system in Serbia is characterized by a universal
health coverage system that is both publicly financed and
publicly provided. Private insurance can also be obtained to
receive quicker access and enhanced consumer choice.
These, however, are not included in the public insurance
scheme (Karajicic & Muzik, 2014).
In 2015, the Euro Health Consumer Index (Health
Consumer Powerhouse, 2015) compared the performance of
health care systems in 35 European countries based on 48
indicators. The Index ranked the Serbian health system as the
30th among these countries. One explanation of such perfor-
mance could be drawn from Transparency International's
(TI; 2015) Corruption Perception Index, which ranked Serbia
as 78 out of 177 countries worldwide in terms of its level of
corruption. This is an overall perception of corruption and
includes not only health care but all public sectors in Serbia.

Informal Payments and Health System
Governance in Serbia: A Pilot Study
Sofie Buch Mejsner1 and Leena Eklund Karlsson1
Abstract
Few studies address Serbian providers' perceptions of informal payments and the association between these perceptions
and health system governance. The aim was to investigate civil servants' perceptions on informal payments of the health care
system in Serbia and to link these results with available evidence on informal payments in other Western Balkan countries. A
literature review on informal payments in Western Balkan and in-depth interviews of civil servants working with Serbian health
care were conducted. Informal payments were mostly taking place in inpatient care and were based on low salaries of doctors,
poor resources, a desire to receive better or faster service, fear of being denied treatment, and an expression of gratitude
through gifts. Policy measures had limited effect and vulnerable groups were more likely to pay informally. There is a need for
further research to highlight how health system governance and prevailing policies affect informal payments in Western Balkan.

2 SAGE Open
(UNODC; 2011), there are notable variations in bribes
between the Western Balkan countries. In this article, bribes
are understood as giving, receiving, or offering goods or ser-
vices to influence the actions of an official. Informal pay-
ments are, therefore, understood as a form of bribery. In
Serbia, almost 14% of citizens at age 18 to 64 reported that
they had directly or indirectly experienced bribery during the
study period. Although there were variations between the
regions of Serbia, 9% of the interviewees had paid at least
one bribe during that period. In 56% of the cases, the citizen
offers to pay, and in 14% of the cases, they are asked to make
bribes to the public administration staff (UNODC, 2011).
According to several studies (International Federation for
Human Rights, 2005; TNS Medium Gallup, 2011), the citi-
zens of Serbia believed that health was the most corrupt sec-
tor. UNODC (2011) found that one in three Serbian citizens
who participate in any type of bribery do so to receive better
service and one in five to speed up the service. Medical doc-
tors are one of the groups of public officials that receive the
most bribes. In the present study, these illegitimate bribes are
referred to as informal payments. The concept of informal
payments also includes gratitude gifts. In this study, the term
"informal payments" will, therefore, include both gratitude
gifts and bribery.
Several studies (Avdyli, 2010; Colombini, Rechel, &
Mayhew, 2012; Gupta, Davoodi, & Tiongson, 2000;
Nekoeimoghadam, Esfandiari, Ramezani, & Amiresmaili,
2013) show that informal payments have negative effects on
health care access, equity, and population health. WHO
(2000) claimed that any demand for out-of-pocket payment
(formal and informal payment for health services) will lead
consumers to reduce their use of health services. This may
hurt particularly the poor by limiting their access to health
services. Lewis (2007) claimed that informal payments
sometimes exist alongside formal payments, and a distinc-
tion between these is difficult, which undermines the report-
ing of informal payments. Therefore, informal payments
may cause inequity in the sense that they can impoverish
some groups of society, whereas groups with greater
resources receive better quality of care. Consequently, the
financing of the health system determines the burden of
health care payments in society and the level of protecting
poorer groups from further poverty (financial risk protec-
tion; WHO, 2000).
Informal payments indicate poor health system gover-
nance as they are linked to a lack of control and accountabil-
ity in health care and weak rule of law (Gaal & McKee,
2005). In addition, information about the existence of infor-
mal payments in Serbia is scattered, and there is a poor over-
view of informal payments and their consequences on the
Serbian health care system. To identify future research focus,
this exploratory study aimed to investigate Serbian civil ser-
vants' (government officials, that is, doctors working in the
health care system) perceptions on informal payments of the
health care system (Gaal & McKee, 2004; Greer, Wismar, &
Figueras, 2016; Vian, 2008). As this is a pilot study, only one
country (Serbia) was selected for the empirical data collec-
tion. Only little evidence about the topic regarding Serbia
was available. Knowledge based on existing literature from
other Western Balkan countries completed the results
(excluding Macedonia because no such study fulfilled the
inclusion criteria of the literature review).
Definition of Concepts and Theoretical
Framework
A variety of professions have acknowledged the existence of
informal payments in health care. However, there are sub-
stantial differences in the definition of the concept and no
definition covering the various aspects of informal payments
is available (Chereche, Ungureanu, Sandu, & Rus, 2013.
Vian (2008) argued that one of the fundamental issues that
illustrate this conceptual confusion is the uncertain differen-
tiation between gifts and bribes in health care. One perspec-
tive features cultural aspects and sees informal payments as
an expression of gratitude, whereas another includes feeling
compelled to make unofficial payments to receive higher
quality care. These payments vary from flowers, sweets,
small tips, or large sums of cash (Gaal, Belli, Mckee, &
Szócska, 2006). As concluded in the systematic review of
Chereche and colleagues (2013, p. 110), the definition of
Gaal et al. (2006) is the best yet available. Despite its limita-
tions toward solely considering informal payments as an
additional payment on top of any formal out-of-pocket pay-
ment (Chereche et al., 2013), the present study will take
inspiration from the definition described as
a direct contribution, which is made in addition to any
contribution determined by the terms of entitlement, in cash or
in-kind, by patients or others, acting on their behalf, to health
care providers for services that the patients are entitled to.
Polese (2014) argued that there is a blurred line between gifts
and bribes in that they depend largely on the context and
long-term relationships that maybe generated from both gifts
and bribes. Balabanova and McKee (2002) also doubted
whether gratitude gifts exist in health care, as any payment
favors the payer in obtaining preferential access to care.
Liaropoulos, Siskou, Kaitelidou, Theodorou, and Katostaras
(2008) showed that only one fifth of the respondents paid out
of gratitude, whereas nearly half of the respondents did so
out of fear of otherwise receiving lower quality care. One of
those proposing a conceptualization of informal payments as
an unregulated fee is WHO (2000), suggesting to define
informal payments as an act of corruption (i.e., bribery).
Gaal and McKee (2004) attempted to explain informal
payments through a theory that takes its starting point from
Hirschman's (1970) work on "Exit, Voice, and Loyalty." The
theory attempts to analyze peoples' reactions to a decline in
organizations and states, which leave consumers (patients)
Buch Mejsner and Eklund Karlsson 3
and employees (doctors) unsatisfied. In this case, consumers
and employees would either leave the organization (Exit) or
complain to available channels (Voice). The latter option
assumes "Loyalty" to the organization, as voice is usually
less effective and more risky (Gaal & McKee, 2004).
Regarding informal payments, other characteristics of Exit
and Voice are present insofar as dissatisfied people do not
complain (Voice) or leave the organization (Exit) but seek
change through informal methods such as payments or con-
nections. The latter resemble an internal/informal Exit, hence
the term INXIT (Gaal & McKee, 2004). The theory explains
some possible reactions from patients and doctors when
unsatisfied with the organization of health care. Lewis (2007)
and Gaal and McKee (2005) emphasized that informal pay-
ments are symptoms of poor management, underfunding,
poor control in health care, lack of accountability, and defi-
cits in rule of law, that is, poor governance. Informal pay-
ments consequently appear to be linked to governance in
health care, leading public and private spending in health
care to have no impact (Lewis, 2006).
Vian (2008) illustrated the reasons and opportunities for
informal payments and suggested that civil servants abusing
public position and power for private gain do so because they
feel pressured to abuse, because they are able to rationalize
their behavior (e.g., individuals' beliefs, attitudes, and social
norms influence informal payments, and to some individu-
als, it may therefore be morally acceptable to give civil ser-
vants money or gifts), or because they have the opportunity
to abuse. Civil servants often act in a manner that maximizes
their self-interest, weighing the costs and benefits of acting
corruptly against acting with integrity (Vian, 2008). The
opportunities to act corruptly are influenced by six factors:
monopoly, which creates opportunities for informal pay-
ments by limiting the ability of citizens to choose other ser-
vice providers; discretion, referring to the autonomous power
of civil servants to make decisions; accountability, which is
governments' obligation to demonstrate effectiveness in
reducing informal payments; citizen voice, representing the
channels and means for active participation by stakeholders;
transparency, referring to the active disclosure of informa-
tion relating to decision making and performance measures;
and enforcement, which is the collection of evidence of
informal payments and the punishment of those engaging in
such acts (Vian, 2008). These six factors are important in
capturing informal payments and should be considered in
strategies to tackle these.
Method
Empirical Part
Sampling.A purposive nonprobability sampling was per-
formed (Bryman, 2008) meaning that individuals who were
appropriate for answering the research questions were
approached. The participants were expected to be educated
within the health care field (i.e., doctor, nurse, nursing assis-
tant) and fluent in English (due to the feasibility of the study
it was not possible to include translators or other interna-
tional or local researchers). Online websites were searched to
find participants at national and regional public health insti-
tutions and primary care centers in Belgrade and Vojvodina.
The participants were sent an email, asking them to partici-
pate. The online selection of participants was necessary due
to lacking network in the area and was a less time-consuming
approach. Primary care centers were chosen, as they are pub-
lic institutions where informal payments have been claimed
to take place (Simic et al., 2012). The Public Health Insti-
tutes in Belgrade and Vojvodina were selected, as they do
research on population health and on performance and func-
tioning of the health care system. Other institutions such as
the National Health Insurance Fund and the Ministry of
Health were not included due to difficulties in locating con-
tact information on specific officials through the Internet.
Networking would have been an appropriate approach for
locating these officials, though time constraints made this
unrealistic.
In Vojvodina, centers in the municipalities and cities of
Novi Sad, Sombor, Pancevo, Zrenjanin, Kikinda, Subotica,
Vrsac, and Sremska Mitrovica were contacted. In Belgrade,
centers were contacted in the municipalities of Barajevo,
Cukarica, Grocka, Lazarevac, Mladenovac, Novi Beograd,
Obrenovac, Palilula, Rakovica, Savski Venac, Sopot, Stari
Grad, Surcin, Vozdovac, Vracar, Zemun, and Zvezdara. Four
participants from the Public Health Institute in Novi Sad and
a primary care facility in Stari Grad agreed to participate.
Data collection and study participants. The data collection was
conducted in Belgrade and Vojvodina in the first week of
August 2014. The data consisted of two semistructured group
interviews on-site and one follow-up interview through
Skype (n = 4). Participants of the first interview were two
public health officials from Novi Sad (Vojvodina) and those
in the second interview were two health care providers from
Belgrade. The Skype interview was with one of the public
health official from Novi Sad. The participants were female,
medical doctors, or specialists in social medicine and aged
between 30 to 60 years. They worked as department heads at
an institute of public health or as employees in a primary care
center. The respondents of the on-site interviews were paired
(two respondents in each interview) so that they could also
assist each other with language difficulties, despite speaking
fluent English, and to create better flow.
Interview guide and conducting the interviews. The interview
guide included questions on the respondents' beliefs about
informal payments and their views on the health care sys-
tem and its governance, the functioning of the center, coor-
dination between secondary and tertiary care, and service
delivery. The questions were based on Vian's (2008) frame-
work, theory on trust derived from the study of Aasland,
4 SAGE Open
Grødeland, and Pleines (2012). The themes of the guide
were "perceptions on health care," "corruption in the health
sector," "informal networks," "trust," and "equity." The
interview guide was pilot tested and revised twice before
the actual interviews. The interviews, conducted in English
and recorded on a dictaphone, lasted approximately 1 hr.
The interviews were transcribed verbatim into Microsoft
Word. Transcripts of the interviews were returned to the
respondents to confirm their statements and to allow them
to add additional comments.
Data analysis method.The phenomenological hermeneutical
approach adopted from Lindseth and Norberg (2004) was used
to inductively develop emerging themes. To understand the
interviewees'approach to informal payments, it was necessary
to first apply this method to investigate their common percep-
tions of the term. To grasp the meaning as a whole, the text
was read through several times, and an overall understanding
of the data was formulated. In Lindseth and Norberg's (2004)
methodological description, this is called a naïve understand-
ing. This understanding guides the next steps in the analysis
and must be validated through reading literature. The vali-
dated understanding then further guides the subsequent the-
matic structural analysis, where themes were identified in the
text and separated into units of meaning. These units consisted
of the respondents' quotations and were marked with the
respondent's participant number. The units of meaning were
printed out on paper to better manage the material and to iden-
tify sections and quotations that were similar and thus formed
a pattern. Subsequently, these units of meaning were reflected
against the validated naïve understanding, condensed into
neutral summaries, and abstracted into main themes and sub-
themes. After this categorization, the themes were once again
reflected on, reorganized, and sorted into final themes and
subthemes. Finally, the findings from the data analysis were
sent to the participants for feedback.
Ethical considerations.An application for ethical approval
was sent to the Ethical Committee at the Institute of Public
Health of Serbia including the informed consent form, the
study protocol, and an explanation of the interview process
and the interview guide. The Institute of Public Health of
Serbia approved the ethical clearance on August 26, 2014.
Despite applying for the Ethical clearance in a timely man-
ner, it was not possible to receive the final approval before
conducting the interviews. Nevertheless, the researchers cor-
responded with a member of the committee during July
2014, confirming the approval of the initial qualitative study,
with minor revisions. Before conducting the interviews, an
informed consent form was signed by the participants.
Literature Review
A literature review was completed to complement the quali-
tative data. An initial literature review was also conducted
before the qualitative study, among other things, to narrow
the study of informal payments to only one country (Serbia).
The following literature review was focused on health sys-
tem governance and informal payments in all Western Balkan
countries to get a broader view on informal payments in the
area. The aim was to answer to the following question: What
existing evidence is available on informal payments and how
dispersed are informal payments in Western Balkan?
Inclusion and exclusion of studies and search strategy.Inclusion
and exclusion of studies was completed in an iterative man-
ner, where search terms were redefined when becoming
familiar with the literature. In assuring the comprehensive-
ness of evidence, the steps of phrasing the research question
and searching and selecting relevant published and gray lit-
erature were repeated. The three overall search terms "Health
Systems Governance," "Western Balkan," and "Informal
Payments" were constructed, including 89 sub-keywords
connected with the Boolean operator OR. The three overall
search terms were initially searched separately in the eight
databases of PubMed, CINAHL, Social Sciences Citation
Index, Science Citation Index, Applied Social Sciences
Index and Abstracts, Worldwide Political Science Abstracts,
Conference Proceedings Citation Index Science, and Confer-
ence Proceedings Citation Index Social Science & Humani-
ties. Afterward, a combined search of the separate searches
was then completed with the Boolean operator AND.
Inclusion criteria were based on the number of Western
Balkan countries included; whether concerning governance
and informal payments in health care; sufficiency of quality
and whether including primary evidence; studies from the
time frame 1991-2015; or studies in English language.
Excluded studies were unable to fulfill inclusion criteria or
were duplicates. Both quantitative and qualitative studies
were included, making this a mixed studies review.
A manual search was also conducted by looking through
reference lists of relevant literature. Many articles were
not in English, did not regard Western Balkan countries,
did not meet all inclusion criteria, or were already identi-
fied. Therefore, no additional articles were included from
this search.
Study selection.A total of 387 studies were identified from
the search after 40 duplicates had been removed. In total, 277
studies were excluded after screening titles and abstracts.
Many of these had focused on the business sector or political
or police corruption. 70 studies were examined more thor-
oughly, from which 64 did not meet the inclusion criteria.
Finally, six studies were included in the review (Figure 1).
Data from the six studies were extracted to Microsoft Excel
to organize the data. Information extracted from the studies
was completed with inspiration from Centre for Reviews and
Dissemination (2008) and included 18 indicators, that is,
year, author, study design, aim/objectives, age, gender, and
ethnicity of patients.
Buch Mejsner and Eklund Karlsson 5
Appraisal of included studies.The six included studies were
assessed by using the Mixed MethodAppraisal Tool (MMAT;
Pluye et al., 2011), developed by McGill University in Can-
ada. The methodological quality was assessed using the cor-
responding criteria for qualitative, quantitative, or mixed
method studies. A quality scoring system was performed giv-
ing quality scores of 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% for each
study. One included study scored 50% (moderate) whereas
five of the studies scored 75% (good), due to mainly lack of
information in the reporting (Table 1).
Synthesis methods.A thematic synthesis method was used to
interpret the data, to maintain consistency between the quali-
tative study and the literature review. The analysis was com-
pleted with inspiration from Popay and colleagues (2006),
who also argue that thematic syntheses maybe used when
synthesizing qualitative, quantitative, and mixed method
studies. The quantitative variable labels that were included in
the individual studies were extracted as themes in the same
way as conceptual themes were extracted from the qualitative
studies (Popay et al., 2006). These were then summarized
narratively and are reported in the literature findings section.
Findings of the Empirical Part
According to the main themes (italics) from the structural
thematic analysis, the respondents emphasized primary
care as the main function of the health system. They also
argued that primary health care is poorly governed by the
state, which creates low incentives for doctors to perform.
This poor motivation caused the doctors to not live up to
people's expectations for service provision. Furthermore,
only the public provision of health care services is avail-
able in Serbia, but some larger cities have private benefi-
ciaries to support their health budget, causing an uneven
balance between cities. In general terms, some respondents
believed that primary care functions well. However, respon-
dents also stated that informal payments exist in health care
and that poor communication caused informal rules to take
over formal rules. Finally, transitioning into the EU was
seen as a positive step, although the process of transition-
ing is perceived to move slowly. The main themes will be
further elaborated in a narrative hermeneutic way.
Perceptions on Health Care, Service Provision,
and Governance in Transition
The respondents believed that primary care was important
because of its closer patient­provider relationship compared
with secondary and tertiary care. They believed that health
care benefited economically from a focus on primary care.
Concerning governance, the data indicated that health care
was poorly managed, which indicates poorly governed pri-
mary care. This was drawn from statements, among others,
that there was poor communication between the three levels
of health care.
The patient give[s] the paper to the nurse and she says "OK" and
nothing; the doctor doesn't see my reference. They don't know
what I have done before, and what is my suspicion, what I am
thinking about the patient.
General practitioners were believed to be obsolete and inca-
pable of providing sufficient care to patients. This was related
to poor communication between the three levels of health
care, as the respondents believed that specialists undermined
general practitioners, which caused inefficiency and mini-
mized trust between health professionals. Therefore, discrep-
ancies between people's expectations of services and actual
service provision were reported. The interviewees argued
that trust in general practitioners had decreased primarily due
to their low social status. However, the respondents felt that
the poor funding of primary care caused more damage than
this lack of trust. The respondents believed there were a lack
of funding and an emphasis on specialist treatment within
secondary and tertiary care.
They do not have enough tools to work with. So it is very
difficult to work in primary health care because in general, we
said that the most important part of the health care is the primary
health care but when the Insurance Fund decided where to give
the money, they give the money for hospitals and other centers:
25% [of] financial resources are going to the primary health care
and they said they must solve 80% of the whole health problems
and needs.
Due to underfunding and poor resources in primary care, the
respondents believed that citizens perceived primary care
doctors to be incompetent. Specialist care was perceived as
higher quality. Doctors, in general, were also believed to be
unfamiliar with general practice when graduating from school
Figure 1. Diagram of included and excluded literature.

because schools emphasize specialist medicine. All of the
above is believed to create an expensive health care system
that is based on treatment rather than prevention. These fac-
tors were perceived to create low incentives for doctors' per-
formance and poor motivation among primary care doctors,
causing more inefficient service provision. The data indicated
that poor resources in primary care were seen to be the reason
why general practitioners referred patients to specialists.
Consequently, general practitioners were perceived to have
an obsolete function.
The main problem is, if the doctor wants to solve some problem
(treat a patient in the primary care clinic), he doesn't have
enough tools and resources. So he cannot do that. So it is the
main problem: it is easier to send him to the specialist.
Another example of poor incentives to perform, according to
the informants, was the low salaries of doctors.
. . . one, they are not enough paid. Salary is disgracefully low.
They are not paid enough to do their work. Today, also, the
salaries are disgracefully low for that kind of quality
professionals.
Low salaries also indicate a low position in the society of
general practitioners. As a consequence of these factors, the
respondents believed that some doctors have left the country
to find more favorable jobs elsewhere.
The informants believed that there was a difference
between rural and urban primary care centers. For instance,
Novi Sad, an urban city, reported having several private ben-
eficiaries assisting with health care; these are lacking in rural
areas.
So NGOs together with health institutions are providing some
health care programs for the citizens of Novi Sad. All other, as to
my knowledge, other municipalities, towns or cities in Vojvodina
do not have that kind of budget.
Private practice was not included in service provision.
Instead, patients who could afford to do so had the option to
supplement public services with private insurance services.
Persons can also add private insurance. So, everyone is free to
pay contributions to private fund and then make some additional
health services, etcetera, or better conditions in hospitals,
etcetera. So that is how it works in our country. Now.
The respondents believed that only a low percentage of citi-
zens could afford additional private insurance and that pri-
vate providers should not be included with public service
provision. They also stated that they believed that a future
plan of the government is to include private practice in pub-
lic service provision.
The informants felt that the transitioning into the EU
would benefit Serbia. However, one respondent believed that
some laws from the previous regime, Yugoslavia, were more
favorable than those from the EU. For example, the EU
immunization laws are believed to favor collective rights
over individual rights.

The huge way of solutions in the European Union is good, and
we are happy to go there because, I think, maybe they will
change the system of managing, and the transition become the
real thing, not only the thing on paper. But in some way, they can
look in local legislative and see maybe it is better.
Corresponding to the previous results on governance, two
respondents believed that Serbia still had long way to go
before becoming a democratic European country but that it
was gradually transitioning into the EU.
Well, we are learning. We are learning the hard way, I think. It's
not something that is natural for us, still. We are far from that,
you know. We do have it on paper, you know. We have a multi-
party system or something, but deep down, here and here [points
to the heart and head] I don't feel that very much. I don't feel that.
There appeared to be a perception that traces of the previous
Yugoslavian regime remained in Serbia. The informants
believed, for example, that politicians did not fulfill their
duty to transition into democracy. It was also alluded that
general citizens did not regard solidarity and social capital
(including informal and formal social networks) as common
principles of society. Half of the informants believed that
there were different societal aspects to living in rural and
urban areas, and therefore trust and democratic participation
were different between these areas.
Perceptions on Informal Payments
The respondents expressed belief that informal payments
were present in the health system.
Yes, it exists, but in hospitals. Not in all hospitals, but partly.
And hospitals in surgery department[s] and gynecologists.
Some of the respondents believed that specialists and the
biggest branches of medicine were the most burdened, and
therefore additional payments for services occurred. Half
of the respondents said that the public perceived primary
care to be transparent and open. They did not believe that
informal payments occurred in primary care, especially
given the increased licensing and accreditation in the area.
This was, however, not the case for hospitals, as they were
difficult to monitor because they provide a wider range of
services.
They are trying to do that (monitor hospitals), but it is very hard.
It's hard to monitor their services because there is so wide [a]
range of services. And I think it will be some time before they
have to do like us.
Respondents further claimed that primary care should be
the core of any health system, due to the positive patient­
provider relationship and the economic benefits. Although in
Serbia, general practitioners were believed to be obsolete
and incapable of providing sufficient care to patients. Also,
the poor funding in primary care and an emphasis on special-
ist treatments increased the discrepancies of people's expec-
tations of services and the actual service provided.
Due to underfunding and poor resources in primary care,
the respondents believed that citizens perceived primary care
doctors to be incompetent, perceiving specialist care as
higher quality. The data indicated that poor resources in pri-
mary care were seen to be the reason why general practitio-
ners referred patients to specialists, indicating that informal
payments may take place in this process.
The main problem is, if the doctor wants to solve some problem
(treat a patient in the primary care clinic), he doesn't have
enough tools and resources. So he cannot do that. So it is the
main problem: it is easier to send him to the specialist.
Low salaries and poor resources in the health system were
also perceived as a reason for these informal payments for
services, because low salaries indicate a low position in the
society of doctors. Although, the respondents believed that
the payments were based on patients' willingness to access
higher quality services and not on doctors asking for money.
You go to the operation and you want the best. Patients feel they
have to pay, for that. For the best service.
Some respondents said that it was difficult to separate infor-
mal payments from gratitude payments and gifts. Giving
gratitude gifts, such as flowers and cakes to doctors, appears
to be a common cultural phenomenon. Such gifts are not per-
ceived to be an informal payment in Serbia, according to the
respondents. Both paying additional cash informally and giv-
ing informal gifts were mostly to express gratitude for satis-
factory care, and the respondents felt that doctors would find
it rude to deny such gratitude. It was also argued that these
gifts create a positive patient­provider relationship. All
respondents believed that any payments for extra care
through informal payments would be of such a small amount
that they were not significant. Therefore, they did not per-
ceive gratitude gifts as being unethical or informal payments
as being a critical issue in health care. One of the respondents
further believed that corruption was more dispersed in poli-
tics and that this was the area where action would be needed.
Bigger corruption is within politicians, not with the doctors.
Believe me.
The media was also believed to exaggerate corruption,
and the respondents perceived reality to be different.
They talk all the time, but they don't say that it is one percent,
ten percent or zero point one percent, of the health professional
who were given some money or something. I don't think it is fair
to talk about that, because we are living in twenty-five years in
very bad condition[s], and they never tell that. That, for example,
a clinical doctor, they work for twenty-four hours for ten Euro.
Do you know that, for example?
8 SAGE Open
Respondents also perceived that some informal rules took
precedence over formal rules in the health care system. They
described poor communication in health care as arising from
the low status of general practitioners. Poor communication
and mistrust in the competency of general practitioners cre-
ated illegitimate informal practices. Consequently, informal
procedures took the place of formal rules, as general practi-
tioners used their friendly relationships with other doctors to
navigate the health care system rather than their professional
networks. It was evident that some general practitioners felt
disregarded and engaged in informal behavior as a coping
strategy. Therefore, when needing assistance or advice
regarding treatments, general practitioners tended to contact
friends rather than a more appropriate specialist for advice.
Findings of the Literature Review
Description of Included Studies
Five of the six included studies were peer-reviewed articles
and one a working paper, mostly concerning Albania. Two
studies considered informal payments in Serbia and the rest
concerned Bosnia Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo, or
Croatia. No Macedonian studies were in the included data.
Designs were typically quantitative, with only one qualita-
tive and one mixed method study. Sample sizes also varied
from 131 to 49,848 people (Table 1).
When examining the included studies, three overall
themes appeared: (a) effects of poor governance and fre-
quency of informal payments in Western Balkan, (b) causes
of informal payments in Western Balkan, and (c) informal
networks in health care systems of Western Balkan. These
themes will be elaborated below.
Effects of Poor Governance and Frequency of
Informal Payments in Western Balkan
In their mixed method study from Serbia, Arsenijevic,
Pavlova, and Groot (A) found that women frequently report
paying both quasi-formal payments and informal payments
for maternity services. Consequently, quasi-formal payments
were a result of discrepancy between official and hospital
guidelines, highlighting the poor governance in the system.
The reported existence of informal payments varied a great
deal from 2% in what they identify as the "pro-government"
publications (from 2009), 10% to 14% in the "non-govern-
ment" publications (2000-2010), and 22.1% in the online
questionnaires (2000-2008). In this study, the highest paid
bribe amounted to 500 Euro. Despite these payments, women
still reported problems with the quality of care they received.
Informal payments were also reported in a cross-sequential
study from Kosovo, Serbia, Bosnia Herzegovina, Montenegro,
and Albania, conducted by Bredenkamp, Mendola, and
Gragnolati in 2011 (B). They found that informal payments rep-
resent a relatively large share of total health expenditure, and
often among the poor population. Accordingly, Albania had the
highest mean share of informal payments of all five countries.
AlsoAlbanian household in the lowest and poorest quintile paid
on average 8% of their total health expenditure in the form of
informal payments, compared with 4% in the richest quintile. In
Kosovo, the share is more evenly distributed; however, the
poorest still paid 2% of their total health expenditure in informal
payments, whereas the richest paid 1%. In Serbia, however, the
richest quintile paid a slightly greater share of informal pay-
ments (3%), compared with the poorest (1%).
In addition to this study, one working paper (D) and one
article (E), both using data from the 2002, 2005, and 2008
Albanian Living Standard Measurement Survey, found simi-
lar results. The former study (D) found that the incidence of
informal payments were fairly high in Albania; however,
these were less frequent in outpatient care than in inpatient
care. A general decline was also found in informal payments
in 2005 and 2008, whereas the other study (E) found an
increase in all health expenditure, including informal pay-
ments, from 2002 to 2008. (In all categories of expenditures,
inpatient and outpatient public and private services related to
medical fees, laboratory tests, drugs purchased, gifts paid to
medical staff, and transport).
Both studies (D, E) revealed that poorest groups in
Albania were those where a decline in informal payments
was least pronounced. In fact, the amount that the poorest
group paid informally increased almost 5 times over the
years (121 ALL in 2002-777 ALL in 2008), whereas in the
richest groups, the increase were more moderate (E). This
increase in informal payments accordingly showed that the
poorest group had an increased expenditure of informal pay-
ments from 7% in 2002 to 10% in 2005 and to 30% in 2008
(of their total expenditure). Although, the increase was not
accompanied by an increase in the relative per capita total
expenditure and, further, shows that policy measures through
2002 and 2008 have had a negative impact on the poorest
groups in this study. Finally, in 2008, the poorest households
had a relatively less budget than the rich if compared with
2002, and the poorest faced higher out-of-pocket payments.
Older people in general paid higher informal payments
for inpatient and outpatient care, maybe as they require
more care than others (D). Generally, working-age adults
were the ones that paid larger amounts of informal pay-
ments and patients in higher consumption quintiles spend
more on informal payments for both inpatient and outpa-
tient services. However, they also found that health insur-
ance lowered the probability of paying informally for both
health care services, but this factor did not affect the amount
paid. Correspondingly, the results showed that generally
vulnerable people having a smaller budget to pay for health
care were more likely to pay informally (D). These results
demonstrate an imbalance of informal payments and indi-
cate that vulnerable groups are more prone to informal pay-
ments, and that people with more resources spend more on
informal payments.
Buch Mejsner and Eklund Karlsson 9
In a Croatian study, Radin (C) found that in 2007, those
who experienced corruption and those that consider corrup-
tion in health care to be the biggest problem (salience) also
did not prefer using public health care facilities. Although, a
preference toward choosing these facilities increased in both
indicators with age and settlement size. Also, an increase in
age increased the odds of trusting public health facilities;
however, in overall terms, corruption still lowered the odds
of preferring public health facilities.
From the opinion polls of 2009, the results were different.
Those with experience of and salience toward corruption in
public health care were more likely to prefer public health
care. Although, this preference decreased when having a
greater degree of education, improvement in economic situ-
ation, and increase in settlement size. These results from
2009 did not support the fact that health care corruption low-
ers trust in health care of the public sector. In fact, the effect
of experiencing health care corruption had a positive effect
on trust in public sector health care.
Causes of Informal Payments in the Health Care
System in Western Balkan
In maternity care in Serbia (A), researchers discovered that
women paying informal payments expressed dissatisfaction
with having to pay, and reported that they only did so for the
safety of their child. Among the women who did not pay and
who did not have connections, 14 reported that they regretted
this and would pay next time. These payments were in addition
to the quasi-informal payments. Others paid informally due to
the low salaries of providers. Patients in Albania correspond-
ingly recognized low salaries and considered their informal
payments as contributing salaries. Providers further rational-
ized their behavior and claimed a higher standard of living (F).
Respondents of the just mentioned Albanian study recog-
nized that some informal payments were given as gifts to
express gratitude. Although, other members of the public
were, as in the study of Arsenijevic et al. (A), also upset to
pay informal payments. Respondents reported that patients
willingly paid informally to receive better attention, faster
care or for a fear of substandard care, and a feeling of secu-
rity. Many respondents, both public and providers, also
reported situations were no treatment was given if a payment
was not made (F). This corresponds to findings in the study
of Arsenijevic and colleagues (A), where respondents
reported, that is, obstetricians to most frequently be paid, to
secure his or her presence during childbirth, out of fear for
substandard care and to secure better quality of care.
Informal Networks in Health System of Western
Balkan
Several studies recognized that people in informal networks
(i.e., friends with or related to a health care provider) are less
likely to pay informal payments. One study (A) found in their
questionnaires that 26 of the women who did not report bribes
indicated that they had connections, such as friends, relatives,
or colleagues, who helped them avoid informal payments by
not accepting payments from them and ensured special treat-
ment and adequate care. The sample indicated that during
2005-2008, the number of women reporting having special
connections increased, whereas reporting informal payments
decreased in the same time frame.Another study (F) similarly
found that providers described lack of social connection as an
indicator for increased willingness of providers to ask for or
accept informal payments. Some providers even indicated
that an informal payment was a way to "warm-up" or create
closer provider­patient relationship. Tomini and Groot (D)
described that rural residents paid less, but in general, they
paid higher amounts of informal payments in outpatient care
compared with residents of urban areas. This indicate that
these rural residents do not pay in their own area due to social
connections, but pay higher amounts in urban areas where
such network connections are lacking and higher opportunity
costs are involved. This is, for example, when needing care at
larger hospitals in urban areas. The fact that vulnerable people
were more likely to pay informally is attributed to the possi-
bility that people with more social connections and informa-
tion (social capital; for example, health care providers) are
less likely to pay informal payments due to their network.
Discussion
Findings from the study indicated that the present way of gover-
nance of the Serbian health system might create negative effects
for the system's functioning. For example, the underfunding of
health care and low salaries for doctors seemed to create imbal-
ances in the Serbian health care system, whereby informal pay-
ments were seen as a coping strategy. This is in line with the
findingsofpreviousstudiesonthesubject(Arsenijevic,Pavlova,
& Groot, 2013, 2014; Janevic, Sripad, Bradley, & Dimitrievska,
2011) and which connect informal payments with poor manage-
ment, underfunding, or a lack of accountability (Gaal & McKee,
2005; Lewis, 2007). Accountability is especially important in a
democracy to hold civil servants responsible for inappropriate
actions and to reduce the likelihood of informal payments
(Greer et al., 2016; Vian, 2008). UNODC (2011) identified cor-
ruption and lack of transparency in the recruitment procedures
when hiring for the public sector in Serbia. This may illustrate
poor public management of the health care system that lacks
integrity and transparency. When investigating Serbian's per-
ception of transparency, United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) and TNS Medium Gallup (2011) further
found that citizens regard transparency as being less important
in the fight against corruption.According to Vian (2008), trans-
parencyisakeyfactorinthefightagainstcorruption.Comparing
this with the INXIT theory of Gaal and Mckee (2004), the
declining performance of health care in Serbia may leave
patients and doctors' needs unsatisfied. Patients and doctors
may choose to leave the system (Exit); however, for patients in
10 SAGE Open
Serbia, private practice is expensive and not commonly avail-
able and they may have no ability to Exit. This may foster the
presence of informal payments, as patients secure themselves
higher quality care (INXIT).ThroughVoice, patients can choose
complaint mechanisms. However, studies show that some
patients in Serbia perceive reporting of informal payments to be
pointless, whereas others benefited from making informal pay-
ments (TNS Medium Gallup, 2011; UNODC, 2011). Informal
payments in Serbian health care appear to be a strategy to infor-
mally "Exit" the system, violating the established rules and
diminishing democracy.
Despite only describing others' experiences with paying
informally, the interviewed Serbians argued that informal pay-
ments were more pronounced in inpatient care services and
that such payments in outpatient care services were not possi-
ble as the centers were working toward becoming licensed,
which required more monitoring. The monitoring of hospitals,
however, was perceived difficult, and there were still no inten-
tion on the part of policy-makers to start enforcing greater
control in these institutions. Even though the respondents may
not have experienced paying informally firsthand, this is wor-
rying in contrast to the ideas of poor technical skills in primary
care providers, which facilitated high referral rates to special-
ist providers, and the informal networks between providers. It
could mean that providers, being perceived as having poor
skills and not being included in an expert network, are passive
about recommending policies for health as stakeholders. These
issues relate to accountability and citizen voice in Vian's
(2008) framework and affect the success or failure of policies
(Greer et al., 2016). The study by UNDP and TNS Medium
Gallup (2011) in Serbia similarly found public passivity and
ignorance concerning the fight against corruption. There was
also a perception among our respondents that corruption was
given too much attention in the media and that the real prob-
lem in health care was not corruption. This may stem from a
lack of knowledge about informal payments and gift giving in
health care. Providers in Serbia may, therefore, not be held
properly accountable for accepting informal payments.
There was a general perception in the findings that
patients were aware of doctors' low salaries and poor work-
ing environment; hence, they gave them gifts and money out
of gratitude or to receive (better) care. Providers further
rationalized their behavior and claimed a higher standard of
living. Thompson and Witter (2000) found such low salaries
to be an important reason why patients give both monetary
and nonmonetary gifts to providers. In Vian's framework,
this is identified as rationalization and pressure to abuse.
Doctors may feel a need to accept informal payments because
they have debt and need to make a living. Patients rationalize
their behavior by regarding informal payments as being
acceptable in the current situation despite free entitlement to
health care. Although as several of the Albanian studies in
the literature review showed (D, E), such payments create
inequity in access to services, as vulnerable groups have a
higher likelihood to pay informally.
Doctors having the opportunity to accept informal pay-
ments (e.g., when a health system is poorly governed) will
often act to maximize their self-interest. This may not be the
cause of informal payments in some countries, although as
Belloni and Strazzari (2014) described it, war can cause ille-
gal informal practices and corruption from informal actors,
who exploit their influence in a transitioning country in an
effort to maximize their self-interest, that is, due to high dis-
cretion or monopoly in health care services. Corruption is,
according to these researchers, not a deviation caused by a
few public officials but rather a structural matter that becomes
standard operating procedure.
It is widely discussed whether informal payments are paid
willingly or out of fear of substandard care. Petrovic (2014)
found that people in Serbia bribe doctors for better treatment
(providers identify an opportunity to abuse) and that corrupt
officials may thrive in a system with low salaries (pressure to
abuse and rationalization), low health care funding, and high
unemployment rates for doctors (providers feel pressure and
have an opportunity to abuse). When patients are ill-equipped
to assess the quality and adequacy of physicians' decisions
and actions, informal payments maybe given to secure fair
treatment. However, quality is often not maximized due to the
patient's inability to judge medical quality (Thompson &
Witter, 2000). The poor knowledge of patients and the domi-
nance of public service provision (monopoly), as is the case
in Serbia, limit the ability of patients to choose other provid-
ers for services, consequently facilitating informal payments.
Civil servants of the qualitative interviews further
described that only a low percentage of doctors engaged in
corruption, but that gifts to medical professionals were
accepted. Giving gifts to health care providers in gratitude
were only identified in one of the reviewed studies from
Albania (F). Other studies concerning Serbia (A, B), Kosovo
(B), and Albania (B, D, E, F) found patients paying infor-
mally for health care services, illustrating that these pay-
ments maybe more pronounced than the Serbian respondents
initially perceive. In Serbia, gifts are seen as a token of grati-
tude to doctors (patients' rationalization). Doctors have dif-
ficulty refusing these gifts, as patients will feel offended and
will accordingly feel a pressure to abuse. Gift giving and
favors among family, friends, and local government officials
in postcommunist European countries are commonly viewed
as social logic (Grødeland, 2013). The reciprocity of "giving
and taking" is rooted in sociocultural factors, where patients
may express gratitude through gifts (Gaal & McKee, 2004;
Polese, 2014). Informal payments may, therefore, be under-
reported in Serbian health care, as gift giving is undeter-
mined. From the same perspective, the present study
illustrated that gift giving created a positive patient­provider
relationship, which maybe a rationalization by both patients
and providers. However, some patients (A, F) were upset to
pay extra for services that they were entitled to. Polese
(2014) believed that informal payments may not only create
a long-term relationship and social contacts but also produce
Buch Mejsner and Eklund Karlsson 11
obligations of reciprocity. Petrovic (2014) argued that many
doctors in Serbia are accustomed to receiving small gifts of
gratitude but that up to 40% of doctors ask for such gifts, and
a number of these also charge informal cash payments. It
becomes a moral discussion then whether gifts are seen as
gratitude or bribes. Petschnig (1983) denied the validity of
gratitude gifts, exclusively believing that they are fees to
obtain personal gain. Although WHO (2000) defined any
form of informal patient payment (including gifts) as an act
of corruption, in practice, it is difficult to determine whether
payments or gifts are tips or bribes.
Despite innocent and kind gestures to medical profession-
als, both WHO (2000) and several researchers (i.e.,
Colombini et al., 2012; Grødeland, 2013; Gupta et al., 2000)
showed that informal payments for health care can have neg-
ative effects on health status, health care access, and equity,
as people delay seeking care or sell assets to pay for care.
WHO (2000) believed that co-payments and informal pay-
ments for services will reduce demand in lower socioeco-
nomic groups. Some segments of society will not be able to
pay additional health care costs, whereas other groups may
receive additional care due to their higher socioeconomic
status. It also becomes difficult for decision-makers to draw
a line between gratuities and bribes when legitimating gifts
in the health care system. In Serbia, further confusion is seen
in the charging of co-payments for services. Distinguishing
between formal and informal payments becomes difficult,
affecting the reporting and perception of informal payments.
In Serbia, it maybe uncertain to patients and providers
whether they are acting corruptly because there is no clear
understanding in the general public of informal payments.
Methodological Considerations
Sampling of the empirical part of the study was purposive to
identify civil servants working in the health system. A further
intention was to include patients and/or the general public to
identify a broader perspective on informal payments, but this
was not feasible, as a translator or local researchers would have
been needed and also given the limited time and resources
available for this research. For the same reason, only English-
speaking participants were included, potentially missing infor-
mation that could have been valuable to the study. Sampling
bias is, therefore, a potential limitation to the study, and the
purposive sampling was sufficient to develop an initial under-
standing, but is not generalizable. The literature review was
conducted to strengthen the evidence of these qualitative data,
providing a more solid understanding of the phenomenon of
interest. Inclusion of studies was, however, narrow and could
have provided a stronger evidence base with broader inclusion
criteria. The purposive sampling of the public health institutes
and primary care centers included inclusion and exclusion cri-
teria for doctors and public health officials within Belgrade and
Vojvodina. Other cities could have been included, and more
interviews could have been conducted. However, networking
and additional calls would have been necessary for additional
recruiting, which was unrealistic in terms of time constraints. It
was also necessary to obtain approval from management before
conducting interviews, which further limited recruiting.
Although this is a pilot study, the included data are sufficient to
suggest research that is needed to fill the knowledge gaps.
Furthermore, a wider variety of professionals would still have
represented the same institutions as already included, as other
institutions declined to participate. Nonetheless, the literature
review was conducted in a comprehensive manner, including
data from several Western Balkan countries and enabling a
comparison between the empirical findings and what is already
known on the subject.
Three potential participants denied participating in the
study when realizing the topic to be connected to corruption
and in fear of consequences to the individual participants.
Budak and Rajh (2012) argued that corruption maybe under-
reported due to citizen's awareness that they live in a "sur-
veillance society," combined with their memories of an
undemocratic regime. This might prevent the reporting of
corruption experiences. Some civil servants were also pro-
vided an option to fill out a questionnaire rather than to pro-
vide a live interview. Questionnaires were, therefore, sent to
these respondents and to all potential participants who did
not respond, to accommodate any reluctance to conduct a
live interview, but none were returned. Sampling bias in the
qualitative study is therefore present, as only those subjects
who were willing and able to talk about health system gover-
nance and informal payments were interviewed.
Conclusion
Primary care was not considered to currently be serving as the
core of health care and was perceived to be underfunded and
inefficient. Underfunding and the poor motivation of doctors
were perceived as incentives for corruption and informal pay-
ments according to the literature from other Western Balkan
countries and the Serbian respondents of the empirical study.
A related issue is the culture of gratitude gifts identified at all
levels of health care. Difficulties in terms of defining the dif-
ference between informal payments and gratitude gifts were
obvious, and if informal payments are perceived as legitimate,
it might lead to underreporting, making the prevention of
informal payments difficult. Moreover, a poor implementation
of strategies tackling informal payments may worsen the situ-
ation, creating an increase in patients paying informally. Such
consequences may exist particularly for vulnerable groups, as
these were found in some studies to be more likely to pay
informally. It may also be difficult for patients and providers in
Serbia and other Western Balkan countries to separate legiti-
mate and illegitimate co-payments for health care. From the
statements of respondents, scientific research (Gaal & McKee,
2005; Lewis, 2006, 2007), and theoretical concepts (Gaal &
McKee, 2004; Vian, 2008), this study suggested an association
between poor governance of the health care system and
12 SAGE Open
informal payments in Serbia. One of the most imperative
issues identified was the value-laden and culture-bound per-
ception of what is considered an informal patient payment.
Implications for Future Research
A more comprehensive systematic review would be needed
to examine research gaps such as the lacking scientific evi-
dence on informal payments by some vulnerable groups, that
is, migrants. This includes also governance of the health care
systems and implications of paying informally. More scien-
tific research is needed on the nature of gifts as gratitude to
doctors and on patients' trust in health care providers (deter-
mining, for example, their selection of health care facilities)
and the quality of treatment that may lead them to pay doc-
tors informally. Future research should further focus on the
implementation and effectiveness of interventions on infor-
mal payments such as the effectiveness of policy measures.
A more in-depth study through interviewing the general
public and civil servants of the health care system would also
be needed. The study maybe used to inform decision-makers
on positive and negative aspects of ongoing anticorruption
strategies. The aim should, therefore, focus on generating new
theories on ways to implement strategies to combat informal
payments in the Western Balkan health care settings.
