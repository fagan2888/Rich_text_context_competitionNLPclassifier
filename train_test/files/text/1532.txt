WOMEN ages 60 years and older make up a large and
growing portion of the United States population and are
projected to outnumber men at older ages through 2050 (U.S.
Census Bureau, 2004). For men, aging is largely a partnered
experience. The majority of men experience aging, illness, and
death with their life partner. In contrast, many women experi-
ence their later years alone (Lindau et al., 2007). The implica-
tions of these gender differences for health in later life are
poorly understood. The National Social Life, Health, and Ag-
ing Project (NSHAP) was designed, in part, to identify bio-
logical mechanisms through which social, including intimate
and sexual, relationships affect health as women and men age.
Collection of sensory function measures (olfaction, gus-
tatory function, vision, tactile sensation) (Schumm et al., in
review), salivary sex hormone measures (estrogen, testos-
terone, progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone) (Gavrilova
& Lindau, in review), and vaginal mucosal measures in a
single, population-based study of older adults is novel to
NSHAP and reflects the study's orientation toward under-
standing the physiology of social and sexual relationships
and a focused interest in addressing largely neglected areas
of older women's health.
Here, we provide the initial detailed description of the ra-
tionale and methods for vaginal self-swab specimen collec-
tion in the NSHAP study, as well as applications of these data
for health research. Design and implementation of the vagi-
nal self-swab protocol including transportation, methods for
selecting, training, and supporting field staff in vaginal swab
collection, laboratory procedures and coordination, and a re-
sults reporting system are described. Specimens were ana-
lyzed for bacterial vaginosis (BV), vaginal candidiasis (VC)
or yeast, high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV), and cy-
tological characteristics. Participant cooperation, specimen
adequacy, and explanations of missing data are reported.
The first wave of NSHAP, conducted between July 2005
and March 2006, included collection of vaginal specimens
from female respondents. Vaginal specimens provide
microbiologic material, including fungal, viral, and bacte-
rial pathogens that can be deleterious for women's health
and functioning. The rationale for the assays (biological

Objectives. To describe the methods used for, cooperation with, assays conducted on, and applications of vaginal
specimens collected by older women in their homes.
Methods. Community-residing women (N = 1,550), ages 57­85 years, participated in a nationally representative prob-
ability survey. Vaginal self-swab specimen collection and in-home interviews were conducted between 2005 and 2006.
Specimens were analyzed for bacterial vaginosis (BV), vaginal candidiasis (VC), high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-
HPV), and cytological characteristics. Field methods, consent procedures, the swab protocol, laboratory procedures, and
results reporting are described.
Results. One thousand twenty-eight respondents (67.5% weighted) agreed to provide a vaginal specimen; 99.1% were
successful. The specimen adequacy rates were BV and VC, 94.1%; HR-HPV, 99.7%; and cytology, 85.5%. The most
common recorded reason for nonparticipation was a physical or health problem (38% of nonresponders). Responders
were significantly more likely than nonresponders to be younger and more educated, and were more likely to report a
recent pelvic examination, menopausal hormone use, and recent sexual activity.
Discussion. Collection of vaginal self-swab specimens from older women in a population-based study is feasible and
provides novel data on microenvironmental characteristics of the female genital tract relevant to analyses of gynecologic
health, sexual activity and problems, and immune and inflammatory function.

analyses) performed on the NSHAP vaginal swab speci-
mens, including BV, VC or yeast, human papillomavirus,
and vaginal cellular characteristics (cytology), follows.
BV is a common polymicrobial condition of the vagina
that occurs with reduction of vaginal acidity (pH) and a shift
in the normal bacteria that colonize the vagina. The estimated
population prevalence of this condition among younger
women in the United States (ages 14­49 years) is 29% (Alls-
worth & Peipert, 2007). While often asymptomatic, symp-
toms include a thin, fishy vaginal discharge that can worsen
following sexual intercourse. Douching, sexual intercourse
with multiple partners, oral sex particularly with a new sex-
ual partner, and cigarette smoking are associated with BV in
younger populations (Allsworth & Peipert, 2007; Marrazzo
et al., 2002; Ness et al., 2002; Smart, Singal, & Mindel,
2004). BV has been associated with infection of the lining of
the uterus and upper genital tract, urinary tract infections,
infectious complications following gynecologic procedures,
and sexually acquired HIV transmission (Harmanli, Cheng,
Nyirjesy, Chatwani, & Gaughan, 2000; Peipert, Montagno,
Cooper, & Sung, 1997; Sewankambo, 1997; Soper, Bump, &
Hurt, 1990). Although most research on BV has been con-
ducted in younger populations, one northern Italian study of
921 postmenopausal women seeking gynecologic care found
a BV prevalence of about 6% (Cauci et al., 2002). This is
likely a low estimate of the population prevalence of BV
among older women, as the condition may inhibit women
from seeking gynecologic services or be associated with
other barriers to medical care. BV can be persistent, irritat-
ing, and malodorous, and left untreated can compromise
quality of life, including sexual activity and functioning.
VC results from overgrowth of a yeast species commonly
found in the normal vaginal flora. It is highly prevalent
among younger women and, based on clinical data, is less
frequently diagnosed among postmenopausal women.Yeast
can cause vaginal and vulvar irritation, itching, burning
with urination, and a thick white vaginal discharge. It can be
episodic, recurrent, or chronic and, if not treated, can cause
disruption in sexual and social functioning due primarily to
the physical discomfort. Obesity, incontinence, and seden-
tariness can promote and/or exacerbate yeast vaginitis. The
symptoms are similar to those, and must be distinguished
from, thinning of the vaginal epithelium (atrophy) that oc-
curs with loss of estrogen in postmenopausal women. Yeast
vaginitis can be sexually transmitted or associated with sex-
ual activity but commonly occurs in women who are not
sexually active. Risk factors in older women include diabe-
tes mellitus, immune suppression, and use of antibiotics,
estrogen, and pessaries (vaginal devices used to treat pelvic
organ prolapse) (Sobel et al., 1998).
Human papillomavirus (HPV), a common sexually trans-
mitted viral infection of the anogenital tract, is an important
factor in genital tract dysplasia (precancer) and high risk
types are found in association with nearly all cases of cervi-
cal cancer. More than 100 types of HPV have been identi-
fied, with as many as 40 infecting the female genital tract.
HPV infection in younger women is frequently transient but
can be persistent, latent, or reactivated. Risk factors for gen-
ital tract HPV in women include sexual activity, tobacco
exposure, and immune suppression (Baseman & Koutsky,
2005). NSHAP provides data on the presence and subtypes
of HR-HPV or the strains that are most strongly associated
with cervical dysplasia and cancer. With recent availability
of an assay for identification of low-risk HPV subtypes (as-
sociated with vulvar and vaginal warts), work is under way
to make these data available from the NSHAP specimens.
For the first time, these data provide information on popula-
tion prevalence and correlates of HPV among older women
in the United States (Lindau, Drum, Gaumer, Surawska, &
Jordan, in press). Genital tract HPV presence may be a
marker of immune function in older women (Garcia-Pineres
et al., 2006).
The vaginal swab specimens also provide cellular mate-
rial useful for gauging sex hormone metabolism and, in par-
ticular, the bioactivity of estrogens within the vaginal
epithelium. The vaginal epithelium is the cellular layer that
lines the vagina and is physiologically important for sexual
function and an indicator of the overall integrity of the fe-
male urogenital tract, including the bladder, urethra, vagina,
vulva, and pelvic floor support structures. To date, popula-
tion data have not been available for documentation of the
cytological features of the vagina in older women, particu-
larly in relation to sexual function. These data are important
for basic scientific understanding of older female endocrine
physiology and may relate to sexual function and behavior
in later life.
These measures and possible applications are summa-
rized in Table 1.
Vaginal self-swab methods have been used in previous
studies of younger women, mainly to assess HPV preva-
lence or as an alternative to the conventional clinical Pap
smear procedure (Dunne et al., 2007). These methods have
been particularly useful in remote and resource-poor set-
tings. Women are receptive to these methods, find them ac-
ceptable, and, in some cases, prefer self-swab to gynecologic
examination (Chernesky et al., 2005). Few studies have
used vaginal self-swab procedures with older women. NS-
HAP worked with investigators for the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to harmonize
the vaginal self-swab protocols; some data from younger
women in NHANES are therefore comparable to data from
older women in NSHAP. To the best of our knowledge, NS-
HAP is the first study to use a vaginal self-swab protocol
with a large, home-based cohort of older women.
Methods
Details of the NSHAP sample design and participant
characteristics have been previously described (Lindau
et al., 2007). Here, we describe the translation and adaptation
LINDAU ET AL.

of common clinical methods of in-home vaginal microbio-
logical and cytological assessment.
Design and Implementation of the Vaginal Swab Collection
Protocol
Human subjects protocol.--All NSHAP data are pro-
tected by approval from local Institutional Review Boards
and by a National Institutes of Health (NIH)­issued Certifi-
cate of Confidentiality (National Institutes of Health, 2003).
The vaginal swab informed consent protocol involved: (a)
signed consent prior to initiating the interview, (b) detailed
description of collection procedures followed by oral recon-
sent at the time of vaginal swab collection, and (c) for those
providing a specimen, signed consent to receive a mailed
notification of results availability. To ensure anonymity of
the vaginal specimens, each was labeled with a unique iden-
tification number used for tracking in transportation, and
processing, and the results reporting system was operated by
the American Social Health Association (ASHA, Research
Triangle Park, NC). ASHA has expertise in contact center
operations and extensive experience in providing test results
counseling services for federal research and clinical trials.
Laboratories and ASHA had access to only these unique
identifiers. All the vaginal specimen data are available via
the NSHAP public use data set, with the exception of the
HPV assay results. Because a small proportion of the popu-
lation tested positive for HPV and individuals may have dis-
closed their HPV status to sexual partners, these data are
restricted to maximize protection of participant anonymity.
Selection, training, and support of field staff for vaginal
swab collection.--The National Opinion Research Center
(NORC) maintains a large, national field staff with extensive
experience in survey interviewing. Interviewer recruitment and
training protocols were tailored to support the breadth and na-
ture of biological data collection unique to NSHAP, including
vaginal swab collection. A detailed description of interviewer
recruitment, staffing, and training as it relates to integrating
biomeasures into a social science survey has been previously
published (Jaszczak, Lundeen, & Smith, in review).
Field staff recruitment involved detailed description of
expectations and tasks related to the vaginal swab protocol.
Candidate willingness to handle and store vaginal swab ma-
terials and comfort discussing the protocol and its rationale
with participants were assessed. Field staff training proce-
dures combined NORC survey interviewing expertise with
the clinical expertise (gynecology, internal medicine) of
members of the investigator team. Vaginal swab training in-
cluded: (a) pretraining home study using a customized
training video and manual; (b) in-person training involving
direct contact with study investigators (including a clinical
gynecologist), active learning techniques, and practice­
feedback sessions with trainers; and (c) phone-based small
group booster trainings with NORC staff and a physician
study investigator during the field period. All female NS-
HAP participants were interviewed by female field staff
(the NORC field staff pool is predominantly female).
Vaginal swab specimen collection, processing, and re-
sults reporting.--All female respondents were asked to pro-
vide a vaginal self-swab specimen. Biomeasure collection

occurred midway through the interview to facilitate respon-
dent comfort with the interviewer and the procedures. Pro-
cedures were explained using a scripted description aided
by illustrated instructions, developed for NSHAP by a med-
ical illustrator in conjunction with a study investigator who
is a gynecologist (Figure 1). Participant questions were ad-
dressed using a "frequently asked questions" document to
ensure consistency of responses across field staff. Field staff
read each step of the illustrated instructions to the respon-
dent and asked for questions.

Participants were given the instruction card with the col-
lection materials (details on materials have been previously
described) and directed to a bathroom or other private room
in the home (Lindau, Mendoza, Surawska, & Jordan, 2008a,
2008b, 2008c). When the respondent returned, the inter-
viewer then secured the Digene swab inside a tube containing
standard transport medium and the BBLTM CultureSwabTM
inside a tube containing Amies medium without charcoal
(Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The
interviewer labeled both tubes with the unique, numeric iden-
tification number. Additional details regarding the protocol
are summarized below and have been previously published
(Lindau, Drum, Gaumer, Surawska, & Jordan, in review).
At the end of the interview, respondents were instructed
on accessing results for the clinically relevant vaginal swab
assays (presence or absence of BV, VC, or HPV). Respon-
dents were given an identification number and asked to cre-
ate a unique four-digit password to access test results. At 3
and 5 weeks following the interview, willing respondents
received a reminder letter indicating availability of anony-
mous results counseling and reporting at ASHA. Via a toll-
free phone call, ASHA provided respondents with BV, VC,
and HPV test results, pre- and posttest counseling, supple-
mentary educational literature, and referrals. To test the
feasibility of a passive survey for results counseling, ASHA
counselors completed a postcall survey for a subset of calls,
documenting the counseling topics discussed, who initiated
the counseling, and about whom the caller was concerned.
Callers were anonymous; these data are therefore not link-
able to individual-level data in the main NSHAP data set
but are in the process of becoming available as part of the
NSHAP data set (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACDA/).
Transportation and tracking protocol.--At the end of each
home encounter, field staff stored the vaginal swab transport
tubes in an insulated cooler with ice packs. Vaginal swabs
were shipped daily on cold packs in a Styrofoam container to
the University of Pittsburgh, Magee-Women's Hospital De-
partment of Pathology clinical microbiology laboratory via
overnight delivery. The swabs were packaged in accordance
with the federal shipping guidelines for diagnostic biological
material. Following processing at Magee-Women's Research
Institute laboratory, one BBLTM CultureSwabTM for each re-
spondent was repackaged and shipped overnight on cold
packs to the University of Chicago Institute for Mind and
Biology laboratory for cytological analysis. An interactive rec-
onciliation system facilitated remote tracking of vaginal
swabs. Weekly reconciliation between NORC and the Magee-
Women's laboratory compared questionnaire data (indicating
whether a sample was recorded as collected) with laboratory
data (indicating whether a sample was recorded as received).
Discrepancies in reconciliation were resolved and recorded.

VAGINAL SELF-SWAB SPECIMEN COLLECTION i111
Vaginal Self-Swab Assays
The technical details of the vaginal swab laboratory as-
says have been previously described (Lindau et al., 2008a,
2008b, 2008c; Lindau et al., in review) and are summarized
in Table 2.
The availability of specimens for a given assay depended
on: (a) participants providing a vaginal swab specimen, (b)
the success of the field protocol in delivering the swabs to
the laboratories, and (c) the adequacy of the swab for each
of the different assays. The specimen adequacy rate for each
assay is defined as the ratio of vaginal swab specimens that
were eligible for analysis by the laboratory to the total num-
ber of specimens obtained in the home eligible for that as-
say (excluding one specimen lost in the mail).
BV assay and scoring procedure.--Preparation for the BV
and VC assays began with rolling of the culture swab onto
the surface of a glass slide, thereby transferring the vaginal
cellular specimen from the swab to the slide. The slide was
air-dried and fixed with 95% methanol and then stained us-
ing a standard Gram stain protocol (Burke, 1922).
For BV assessment, 20 or more fields of the stained slide
were examined microscopically using an oil immersion ob-
jective (×1,000) (i.e., 20 high-power fields). The relative
number of each of the three classes of observed vaginal bac-
terial organisms including (a) Lactobacillus species, (b)
Gardnerella species and anaerobic gram-negative rods, and
(c) Mobiluncus species were observed. A 0- to 10-point
scoring system (previously described [Lindau et al., 2008a])
clinically classifies the specimen as normal vaginal flora/no
BV detected (0­3 points), intermediate (4­6 points), and
indicative of BV (7­10 points) (Nugent, Krohn, & Hillier,
1991) (Table 3). Slides lacking normal flora (estrogen-
related depletion of lactobacilli can be a nonpathologic state
in postmenopausal women) and lacking criteria for BV
were separately coded. Estrogen-related shifts in the pres-
ence of lactobacilli in postmenopausal women may affect
interpretation of the Nugent classification; this should be
considered in interpreting these scores (Cauci et al., 2002).
VC assay and scoring procedure.--The same gram-
stained slides used to assess BV were also evaluated for
the presence of yeast (for additional details, see Lindau
et al., 2008b). The reader examined the entire area of
each stained slide to determine the presence or absence
of yeast cells showing blastoconidia (cell buds) in the
specimen. A dichotomous score was assigned to each
slide. Figure 2 provides photographs of a normal vaginal
epithelial cell, bacterial vaginosis (BV) and vaginal can-
didiasis (VC).
Genital human papillomavirus assays and scoring
procedures.--The details of the HPV assays have been pre-
viously published, including a flowchart summarizing the
disposition of the assays (Lindau et al., 2008c; Lindau et al.,
in review).
HR-HPV detection by hc2 assay.--HR-HPV DNA testing
was performed on 1,010 specimens using the Hybrid Cap-
ture 2® (hc2) High-Risk HPV DNA TestTM (Catalog No.
5199­1220; Digene, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Specimens with relative light unit/
cutoff values 1.0, obtained using the Digene Microplate
Luminometer 2000 (DML 2000TM) Instrument, were con-
sidered positive for HR-HPV DNA.
HPV genotyping.--Genotyping was performed on 56 hc2
HR-HPV­positive specimens using the Linear Array HPV
Genotyping Test and Linear Array Detection Kit (Roche
Molecular Systems Inc., Pleasanton, CA) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Due to accessibility of the
genotyping assay to our research team in relation to the
study period, only hc2 HR-HPV­positive specimens were
genotyped.
Coding.--HPV-related variables in the NSHAP data set
are not included in the public-use data set, as explained in the
Human Subjects section, above. Each specimen was reported
as positive or negative by hc2 and coded dichotomously. For
those testing positive for HR-HPV by hc2, a dichotomous
variable based on the Roche genotyping assay result indi-
cates the presence or absence of each of 37 genotypes.
Vaginal cytology assessment and scoring.--Preparation
of the cytology slides.--The vials containing BBLTM Cul-
tureSwabTM Plus Amies Medium Without Charcoal BD
(Becton, Dickinson and Company) were delivered in batch-
es packaged with cold packs from the Jordan Magee-Wom-
en's laboratory and were immediately stored at 4°C in a
cold room. The vaginal swabs were kept in their individual
vials until the sample of vaginal epithelium was transferred
from swab to slide. Throughout the transfer process, the vi-
als were placed on wet ice and processed one at a time.
Each swab was placed into a prelabeled 1.5-ml microcen-
trifuge tube (Catalog No. 05-406-16; FisherF Scientific,
Pittsburgh, PA) filled to 1.0 ml with Hanks balanced salt
solution (Catalog No. H6648; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The
solution was used to suspend the vaginal epithelial cells
from the swab, as well as to thin the Amies medium to
facilitate suspension. The swab was gently twirled in the

solution for 15 s and discarded. The culture tube, containing
the remaining cells in the Amies medium, was recapped,
placed on ice, and returned to storage at 4°C along with the
microcentrifuge tube containing the suspended cells.
The vaginal epithelial cells typically settled in the tip of
the microcentrifuge tube and were resuspended by gentle
agitation by flicking the tube with an index finger (mechan-
ical methods degraded the cell suspension). Five slides with
triplicate samples were created to maximize validity, reliabil-
ity, and versatility. First, a 0.15-ml aliquot of the suspended-
cell Hanks solution was micropipetted onto the frosted end
of the microscope slide (25 × 75 mm) (Catalog No.154003;
Propper, VWR, West Chester, PA). Two additional aliquots
were placed on the same slide; the size of the aliquot and
glass texture ensured that the aliquots remained separate.
Five slides from each woman's specimen were prepared,
yielding 15 independent samples of vaginal epithelial cells.
Two of the slides (six aliquots), designated for cytologic
analysis, were immediately sprayed with an alcohol fixative
(Catalog No. 14-372-32; Safetex, Fisher Scientific) and left
to air-dry along with the three additional, unfixed slides. Af-
ter drying overnight, one cytology slide was stained by the
University of Chicago Hospitals Department of Surgical
Pathology with the progressive Papanicolaou stain (Pap
stain) (Bibbo, 1997) using the 24-station Shandon Varistain
XY machine. The other slide, fixed for cytology staining,
was stored in microscope boxes at room temperature for fu-
ture use. The unstained slides were stored in microscope
slide boxes in a 4 °C cold room for future analyses.
Pap staining facilitates cytological coding by adding
color that helps distinguish superficial epithelial cell types
from those deriving from deeper layers of the vaginal epi-
thelium and differentiates nuclear from cytoplasmic mate-
rial. Estrogen promotes cellular glycogen production (the
substrate for lactobacilli, a predominant bacteria normally
residing in the vagina that is necessary for maintaining
acidity [pH]). Typically, glycogen in the estrogenized su-
perficial cells of the vaginal epithelium stains red, reveal-
ing a pyknotic nucleus (Papanicolaou, 1942, 1956). Cells
from the intermediate epithelial cell layer stain light blue
and have a less dense nucleus compared with superficial
cells (Papanicolaou, 1956). Cells from the parabasal layer
stain dark blue and have a larger nucleus than the interme-
diate cells. Basal cells, from the deepest epithelial layer,
stain dark purple and have the largest nucleus of all the
cell types above (Papanicolaou, 1956). These four cell
types are also distinguished from one another by size, the
nuclear to cytoplasm ratio, and the characteristics of their
nuclei. Illustrative photographs are presented in the Re-
sults section.

VAGINAL SELF-SWAB SPECIMEN COLLECTION i113
The vaginal maturation index.--The vaginal maturation
index (MI), a common clinical measure, uses the exfoliated
vaginal cells to evaluate the hormonal status and thickness
of the vaginal epithelium (Cibas & Ducatman, 2003). The
MI also gives insight into the estrogen status of the related
genital structures including the vulva, urethra, and the
bladder (Grodstein, Lifford, Resnick, & Curhan, 2004;
Hammond, 1977). In contrast to a serum or salivary mea-
sure of circulating estrogen, the MI indicates the net effect
of biologically active sex hormones (circulating levels of
free estrogens, androgens, and progestogens) on the vaginal
epithelium and provides an integrated measure of hormonal
bioactivity over time, rather than blood levels at a single
time point (McEndree, 1999). The traditional MI quantifies
the relative proportion of the vaginal parabasal (P), interme-
diate (I), and superficial (S) cells (Bibbo, 1997).
Coders from the Institute for Mind and Biology, experi-
enced in cytology assessment of the rat vaginal epithelium,
were trained by clinical cytopathologists at the University of
Chicago Hospitals to read slides for the MI; coders were not
trained to recognize cellular atypia. First, using a modifica-
tion of the Cibas and Ducatman method, a visual survey ap-
proach at ×100 magnification was used to read each slide
systematically from left to right, checking each aliquot
for cellular number, quality, and consistency (Cibas &
Ducatman, 2003). Slides with at least 100 densely stained
cells, consistent in proportions across the three aliquots,
were considered "excellent" for coding the MI. Slides were
deemed "adequate" if they had one of the following charac-
teristics: moderate staining, fewer than 100 cells, unstained
nuclei, or cell fragments (see photographs in Results). Slides
with several of these characteristics were deemed inadequate
for traditional MI methodology. The coder then estimated
the relative proportion of parabasal, intermediate, and su-
perficial cells (P:I:S), integrating across all three aliquots.
Specimens were obtained for assessment of vaginal, not
cervical, cytological characteristics. Cervical cells are
needed in order to assess risk for cervical cancer (e.g., Pa-
panicolaou smear). Self-collection of cervical epithelial
specimens for cytopathology requires a different approach,
including clinical laboratory assessment and clinical-level
results counseling; this was outside the scope of our
study.
Results
Participant Cooperation in Vaginal Self-Sampling
Of the 1,550 women, 1,028 (66.3% unweighted, 67.5%
weighted) agreed to submit a self-administered vaginal
swab specimen (Figure 3). A total of 522 women were con-
sidered nonresponders; 521 respondents did not submit a
swab specimen, and for one individual the vaginal swab
protocol was inadvertently omitted due to a data entry error
earlier in the interview.
In univariate analysis, participants in the vaginal swab col-
lection were significantly more likely to be younger (<74
years), and have at least a high school diploma, and were more
likely to report a recent pelvic examination, menopausal
prescription hormone use, and sexual activity in the past
year (Table 4). All female participants were interviewed by a
female field interviewer. Field staff whose age matched that of
the study population were significantly more likely to obtain
cooperation with the vaginal self-swab protocol (74.5% of
those 57­85 years old vs. 62.4% of those 28­56 years old, p <
.001). Field staff were encouraged to record the respondent's
reason for refusal, if offered. When recorded, the most com-
mon anecdotal reason for nonparticipation was a physical or
health problem.
Specimen Adequacy
The vast majority of the vaginal self-swab specimens ob-
tained in the home arrived in the laboratories and were ad-
equate to be processed for the assays: 957/1,016 (94.2%)
for BV and VC, 1,010/1,012 (99.8%) for human papilloma-
virus (HPV hc2) testing, and 1,016/1,016 (100%) for cytol-
ogy. For BV and VC, of the 1,016 samples processed, 58
(5.7%) had an insufficient quantity of bacterial or fungal
material and so were inadequate for analysis; 51(5.0%)
were adequate for analysis but not assigned a Nugent score
because they lacked both normal and BV-like vaginal flora.
Details regarding the HPV specimens have been previously
published (Lindau et al., in review); however, among the
1,010 adequate for analysis, all were adequate for testing by
the hc2 assay, and 56 of 64 (87.5%) specimens testing posi-
tive for HR-HPV by hc2 were adequate for genotyping
(Figure 3).
All 1,016 swabs received by the Jordan Laboratory were
sent on to the McClintock Laboratory, and all were pro-
cessed for cytological analysis. Of these, 85.5% were excel-
lent or adequate for traditional MI analysis (869/1,016;
Figure 3). As shown in Figure 4, all three types of vaginal
epithelial cells--superficial, intermediate, and parabasal--
used in the MI were readily identified in the adequately
stained slides. The majority of the Pap-stained cytology
slides that were categorized for MI had more than 100 cells
(722/869, 83%; see Figure 5).
There was little overlap between specimens found to be
inadequate for pathogen analysis (BV, VC) and those found
to be inadequate for cytological analysis. Only 0.9%
(9/1,016) of the specimens were inadequate for both. In
other words, 99.1% of women who provided a swab suc-
cessfully collected a vaginal specimen.
Results Reporting Usage
All respondents who provided a vaginal swab specimen
and/or an HIV test (women and men) were eligible to call
ASHA for results counseling and receipt (n = 1,551) and
LINDAU ET AL.
i114
were provided detailed instructions at the time of the inter-
view about how to access results. Of the respondents eligi-
ble to call ASHA, 882 (56.9%) also agreed to receive mail
notification of results availability. A total of 685 (44.2%)
calls were made to the NSHAP results hotline. The content
of 517 (75.5%) of these counseling conversations were
documented by ASHA phone counselors. Due to a small
number of repeat callers, ASHA estimated that the true
percentage of respondents seeking results was closer to
41%­42% of those eligible for results. Although data on
counseling about BV and VC were collected, they are very
limited due to a high frequency of missing data (resulting
from a programming error in the ASHA electronic passive
survey) and are therefore not reported here. However, HPV
counseling data were successfully obtained.
Among the 517 documented calls, HR-HPV results were
provided to 335 callers, and 100 of these individuals (29.9%)
had questions about HPV. Counseling included definition of
the disease, test accuracy, symptoms, transmission, risk
reduction, treatment, and emotional issues. Respondents
rarely initiated discussions. The most frequently discussed
topics included definition of the disease and symptoms;
emotional issues were the least frequently discussed. For
each counseling topic discussed, the counselor identified
about whom the respondent was concerned--self, partner,
family, or other. Most callers did not identify a specific indi-
vidual of concern, but for those who did, they most often
expressed concern about self rather than others.
Discussion
The acceptability and performance of vaginal self-swab
specimens in studies of younger women are well established
and compare very favorably to specimens collected by clin-
ical transvaginal speculum examination (Chernesky et al.,
2005). Interdisciplinary collaboration among NSHAP in-
vestigators merged clinical medical with social survey and
behavioral endocrinology expertise to successfully imple-
ment novel methods for vaginal self-swab specimen collec-
tion with older community-residing women participants
and nonmedical field staff. Self-swab participation rates
overall (number of collected swabs/number of eligible study
participants) were excellent, particularly given prevalent
functional limitations such as arthritis and obesity that could
interfere with older women's physical ability to accomplish
specimen collection (Drum, Shiovitz, Gaumer, Surawska, &
Lindau, in review).
Although the participation rate was lower in NSHAP
(66.3%) than in a recent NHANES study of HPV in younger
women (ages 18­59 years) using similar self-swab methods

(81.6%) (Dunne et al., 2007), the specimen adequacy rate
for HR-HPV (number of adequate swabs/number of col-
lected swabs) exceeded that reported by NHANES (Lindau
et al., in review), and NSHAP specimen adequacy rates for
BV, VC, and cytology were also very high. In contrast to
NSHAP,NHANES'self-swabspecimensofyoungerwomen
were obtained in a mobile clinical setting, with medical per-
sonnel, and using specimen storage and laboratory transport
procedures typical of clinical protocols. The similarity in
performance of the vaginal self-swab methods across these
two major population studies, despite the differences in
study population and research setting, lends additional reas-
surance about the feasibility of the NSHAP vaginal self-
swab methods for use with population-based samples of
older women.
Collection of vaginal cytological data in the population
setting, particularly from older women, was both highly
novel and highly successful. Interpretation of the MI for
managing gynecologic problems in the clinical setting has
been based heavily on small, referent data sets from indi-
vidual physicians' clinical practices and is therefore subject
to selection bias (Hafez & Evans, 1978). The Pap-stained
cytological specimens obtained in NSHAP are indistin-
guishable from those obtained under clinical conditions.
Although no data are available for comparison, clinical
experience suggests that the specimen adequacy rate is
also comparable. The NSHAP vaginal self-swab protocol
for cytological assessment presents a highly promising, new
field-based biomeasure for use in population-based older
women's health research.
Several factors emerge in bivariate analysis to explain coop-
eration with the vaginal self-swab protocol, including respon-
dent sociodemographic and health characteristics and field
staff characteristics. In contrast to studies of younger women
where sociodemographic factors are not significantly associ-
ated with self-swab participation (Chernesky et al., 2005), we
found that younger, more highly educated, healthier, sexually
active respondents and those indicating participation in gyne-
cologic care were more likely to participate. Interestingly, in
bivariate analysis, field staff whose age matched that of the
study population were significantly more likely to obtain co-
operation with the vaginal self-swab protocol. Concordance
between respondent and interviewer sociodemographic
and/or racial characteristics has been found to be influential
in some cases (Campanelli & O'Muircheartaigh, 1999;
Pickery & Loosveldt, 2002), and accounting for such inter-
actions could be informative. Other mechanisms through
which field staff characteristics may influence respondent
cooperation include field staff experience and confidence
(Groves & Couper, 1998). For future waves of NSHAP, the
impact of both general interviewing experience and prior
NSHAP interviewing experience on participation could be
explored.
During the field period, booster trainings were imple-
mented for a subset of interviewers to maximize respondent
LINDAU ET AL.
i116
cooperation; the effectiveness of this intervention may be
reflected by stable vaginal swab cooperation rates through-
out the study period. Alternately, without additional training
during the data collection period, one might have expected
cooperation with vaginal self-swab collection to be subject
to decline over time as the more reluctant or inaccessible
participants were recruited into the study. Of course, some
cases of missing vaginal swab data are due neither to the
respondent nor to the field staff person but to errors in equip-
ment, transportation, and laboratory processing (as indicated
in Figure 3). Interventions to address these sources of miss-
ing data would need to occur in conjunction with strategies
targeted to respondents or field staff. Further analyses of
field staff correlates of participation could be accomplished
with access to NSHAP operations data; however, these are
currently not part of the NSHAP public use data set.
An anonymous results reporting system provided coun-
seling and results to the respondents who chose to call
for their vaginal swab test results. Most importantly, all
callers seeking results were able to receive their results.
This demonstrates the operational success of the anony-
mous results reporting system, which required flawless
communication among home, Magee-Women's laboratory,
NORC, and ASHA.
All respondents providing specimens for which counsel-
ing was available were given instructions during the in-
home interview for test results access, but more than 40%
declined further notification of results availability, and a mi-
nority of those eligible actually called the ASHA hotline.
Studies of younger adults also find that many respondents
decline to access test results following study participation
(Pugatch et al., 2001). This may be due to active avoidance
of the information, disinterest, or the feeling that the infor-
mation replicates testing already received in the clinical set-
ting. For older adults, difficulty with phone communication
due to hearing or speech problems may also present a bar-
rier. In the case of NSHAP, counseling data collected by the
pilot passive survey were limited by a technical error in sur-
vey programming by ASHA that resulted in inadvertent
skipping of questions relating to BV and VC. This can eas-
ily be overcome for future waves. Although the cooperation
data are limited, they do shed light on the role and value of
a results counseling service for vaginal swab­based testing
in a population-based study that includes older women and
the feasibility of implementing a passive survey in conjunc-
tion with the phone encounters. Interpretation of these data
would be significantly enhanced if linkable to the main data
set; how to accomplish this while protecting participant an-
onymity presents a challenge that we were not able to over-
come in the NSHAP study.
Experience from the NSHAP study demonstrates that
collection of vaginal self-swab specimens from older

women in a population-based in-home study using non-
medical field staff is feasible. The quality of the self-swab
specimens is high, as indicated by a high specimen ade-
quacy rate for all of the assays. Vaginal swab specimens
provide novel data on microenvironmental characteristics
of the female genital tract relevant to analyses of gyneco-
logic health and sex hormone metabolism, sexual activity
and problems, and the immune and inflammatory status of
older women.
