Objective: To study the growth and bone mineralization of children born
prematurely.
Study Design: A cohort of healthy children who were born prematurely
with birth weight less than 1.5 kg were compared by weight and height to a
national reference. Bone mineral status of preterm infants was compared
with children who were born at term gestation. The average follow-up was
7 years. A sample of children who were born prematurely was recalled from
an infant nutrition study. Children born at term gestation who had similar
body weight for age were recruited from the community. Bone mineral
evaluation was conducted in a group of 20 children born prematurely with
birth weight less than 1.5 kg and in 15 children born at term gestation. Body
weight for age was similar between the groups. All children were born of
appropriate size for gestational age at birth. All children had their body
weight and height measured. Comparisons for growth assessment status were
made with the NHANES III database and published standards. Dietary intakes
and food frequency were analyzed. The bone mineral status was measured at
two sites, lumbar spine and distal third radius bone.
Results: The average age was 7 years, with a range of 5 to 9 years.
Compared with the reference population, children who were born
prematurely on the average had lower weights, heights and body mass
index. Preterm children had a lower lumbar bone mineral content than
term children, 12.8±3.0 and 14.7±2.2 g cmÀ1 (P<0.05). The lumbar
bone mineral density was lower in the preterm group than in the term
group, 0.525±0.062 and 0.574±0.073 g cmÀ2, respectively (P<0.04).
Three of the preterm children had a history of fracture whereas none of
the term children reported any fractures.
Conclusion: Children who were born prematurely with birth weights less
than 1.5 kg tend to be significantly smaller for age and have lower
lumbar spinal bone mineral content and density compared with children
born at term gestation.

Introduction
In the newborn period, low bone mass or osteopenia is a frequent
condition in very-low-birth-weight preterm infants. Causes of
osteopenia of prematurity include calcium, phosphorus and
vitamin D deficiency, liver and renal disorders, and medications
such as steroids and diuretics.1,2 Many of these preterm infants
suffer poor growth and fractures.3 However, the long-term
consequences of osteopenia are important, as more preterm infants
are surviving. During infancy, preterm infants grow more slowly
and are smaller than term infants, but by early childhood the
majority of preterm children are reported to have normal weights
and heights.4,5 This study was performed to evaluate preterm
infants' growth and bone mineralization after the age of 5 years.
Methods
Subjects
A total of 20 children who were born prematurely with a birth weight
less than 1.5 kg were studied. These children participated in a
previous infant feeding study where 9 children received their mother's
milk and 11 children received formula during the neonatal period.6
As body weight is the major predictor in bone mineralization, a
convenience sample of 15 children who were born at term gestation
and whose body weight for age was within 2 kg of the preterm
children was selected and served as the control group for the bone
mineral evaluation. All children were of appropriate size for
gestational age at birth. Informed consent with Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization was obtained
from the parents of all children who participated in this study. The
protocol was approved by the University's Institute Review Board.
Procedure
All children were evaluated at the University of Utah Medical
Center. All children had their weights and heights measured by
standard methods. Weights were measured using an electronic
scale that was certified annually. Height was determined using a
footboard. A medical history was completed that included a record
of any fracture and chronic use of any medication such as loop
diuretics and steroids. The hospital record of the children born
prematurely was reviewed for medications that might affect bone
mineralization. A 3-day dietary record and food frequency

questionnaire were collected and analyzed by our dietitian. The
bone mineral measurements were also recorded.
To assess growth, the children who were born prematurely were
compared with the weight and height database from the 1996
National Center for Health Statistics National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys (NHANES) III controlling for age, gender and
ethnicity.7,8
The bone mineral status was evaluated blindly at two sites,
lumbar spine and distal third radius bone. The lumbar spines of L2
through L4 were studied using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry
(XR-26, Norland Corporation, Fort Atkinson, WI, USA), whereas the
distal radius bone mineral content was analyzed by single-photon
absorptiometry (Lunar Radiation Corporation, Madison, WI, USA)
The measurement of the radius and lumbar spine bone mineral by
absorptiometry method is accurate (less than 2% error) and precise
(less than 2%). Both methods are known to be accurate and precise
in the measurement of bone mineral content.9,10
Statistics
Preterm vs term controls. Intergroup differences between
measures of bone mineral content and density were analyzed
by independent sample t-test and between categorical variables,
by w2 test. Simple linear regression was used to determine any
relation between variables. Differences and relationships were
considered significant if P<0.05.
Preterm vs NHANES III controls. NHANES III weight and height
data for males and females aged 5 to 9.99 years of age were
imported into a SYSTAT11 plotting and statistical analysis. The
weight, height and body mass index of all children were plotted
on gender-specific cross-sectional growth charts derived from 10,
50 and 90 percentile values provided by NCHS on the internet
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/growthcharts/
datafiles.htm).8 Log-likelihood w2 goodness-of-fit (G2) analyses
were conducted where the null hypothesis was 50% of the preterm
children would fall above the 50 percentile and 50% below. P<0.05
was considered as the level of statistical significance.
Results
Subjects
All children were healthy and free from any chronic diseases.
All children were Caucasian and were growing appropriately.
The gender distribution between the two groups was similar with
eight males in the preterm group and six males in the term group.
No medications (that is, steroids or diuretics) were used in either
group. The average age for both groups was similar at the time
of study, with a range of 5 to 9 years of age. Both heights
(120.2±9.5 vs 118.9±11.4 cm) and weights (22.9±6.7 vs
22.2±3.9 kg) were similar for both groups (Table 1).
Weight, height, and body mass index of children born
prematurely and NHANES III controls. Children who were born
prematurely had significantly lower body weight and body
mass index, and premature females were significantly shorter
in height compared with the NHANES data (Figures 1 to 3).
Dietary intake
The dietary intakes of protein (70±21 vs 60±11g), vitamin D
(5.7±2.9 vs 4.9±1.3mg), total energy (1856±345 vs 1681±
234kcal), calcium (921±300 vs 835±300mg) and phosphate
(1188±345 vs 980±365mg) were similar for both groups (Table 2).
Bone mineral studies
The bone mineral content of the radius bone tended to
be lower in the preterm group vs the term group

(0.364±0.063 vs 0.419±0.107 g cmÀ1, P<0.06). The bone
mineral density was similar between the two groups. However, the
lumbar bone mineral content and density were lower in the
preterm group than in the term group (0.525±0.062 vs
0.574±0.073 g cmÀ2, P<0.04). There were no correlations
between dietary intakes and bone mineral measurements. Three of
the preterm children had a history of fracture, whereas none of the
term children reported any fractures. All the fractures were located
on the forearm after an accidental fall and occurred when the
children were about 6 years of age. For the children born
prematurely, there were no differences in bone mineralization
between those who had received human milk or formula during
the neonatal period (Table 3).
Discussion
From our study, children who were born prematurely with
very-low-birth-weights had significantly lower body weight and
body mass index, and females were shorter in height compared
with a national reference derived from NHANES III. This finding
is different from those of other investigators.
The majority of
very-low-birth-weight children are reported to have similar weights

and heights of normal birth weight children, with 8% of the
very-low-birth-weight children remaining below the third percentile
in weight and height at 8 years corrected for preterm birth.
Catch-up growth occurred between 40 weeks and 8 and 20 months,
and up to 8 years corrected age among the very-low-birth-weight
children.12 However, there are reports that adolescents born
prematurely are smaller compared with those who were born
at term gestation.13,14
During the neonatal period, preterm infants have bone
mineralization problems such as osteopenia and rickets.1­3
Evidence of poor bone mineralization, rickets and bone fractures
has been reported in more than 30% of infants with birth weights
less than 1000 g.15,16 One of the major causes of bone problems is
calcium and phosphorus deficiency in the postnatal period, either
from an inability to tolerate adequate enteral feeding or from a
deficient mineral intake when fed low calcium and phosphorus
milk, such as human milk or standard term infant formula.
Relatively, poor fat absorption during the neonatal period may also
interfere with calcium and vitamin D absorption. The issue
whether the bone mineralization problems of preterm infants
continue has been evaluated at different ages and by measuring
different bone sites. During the first year of life, several
investigators report that the forearm bone mass of preterm infants
is lower than that of term infants,2,17,18 but the preterm child
may resolve this difference in bone mineralization by 2 years of
age.18­20 However, another study of adolescents with a mean
age of 15 years who were born at extremely low birth weight
<1000 g reports significantly lower total body mineral content
but not density compared with control adolescents.13 Total bone
mineral content is the measurement of the weight of hydroxapatite
or calcium whereas bone density is the bone mineral content
divided by the area. In the prematurely born males aged 4 to
16 years, the bone mineral content of the forearm was less than in
control term males. But by statistically adjusting for weight and
height, this difference in the bone mineral content became less
significant.21 In another study of older adolescents born
prematurely and weighing less than 1500 g, their whole-body
bone mineral content was lower than those born at term
gestation, but again after adjusting for the smaller body size,
the bone mineralization was appropriate.22 In our study, the
comparison group was children who were born at term
gestation and matched by body weight to the preterm children
at the time of the study. From our analyses, the bone
mineralization in the preterm children was low in the lumbar
spine compared with term children. The lumbar bones represent
mainly trabecular bones that are more metabolically active
than cortical or compact bones. Trabecular bone responds to
vitamin D and parathyroid hormone activity.23 Our forearm
measurements, which contain a mixture of both trabecular
and compact bones, showed a tendency for lower bone mineral
content in the preterm children.
Our findings of low lumbar spine mineralization in preterm
children are different from those reported in two Japanese
studies.24,25 In the first study, 40 preterm infants' lumbar spine
bone mineral densities were compared with term infants. During
the first several months of life, the lumbar bone mineral density
was considerably lower than that of term infants.23 In a follow-up
study from the same group, 21 preterm children aged 3 to 4 years
were found to have normal bone mineral content and densities in
lumbar spinal bones.25 However, only two preterm children with
low gestational ages were followed for 8 to 12 months, and their
lumbar spinal bone mineral densities were still lower than those of
term children. Unfortunately, dietary intakes of calcium, phosphate
and vitamin D were not reported in this study. However, these
subjects had higher birth weights than our subjects. The Japanese
mean birth weight was 1764 g, whereas our subject's mean birth
weight was 1200 g.
The cause of the low bone mineralization in the preterm
children remains uncertain. The problem might be due to the
young prematurity (less than 1500 g birth weight) of the children
in our study. Other investigators believe that the bone mineral
status in preterm children is caused by dietary programing during
an early critical period.16,26 During the neonatal period, preterm
infants probably ingested lower amounts of nutrients compared
with term infants. Although the childhood dietary calcium intake
was similar between the two groups, children born prematurely
might require higher intakes to achieve their peak bone mass. In
our study, preterm children suffered three fractures compared with
none in the term group. It is a matter of concern that the preterm
children's forearm bone mineral status tend to be lower than that
of term children. Children with low bone mineralization from
inadequate dietary calcium and phosphate intakes are susceptible
to fractures.27,28
In summary, children who were born prematurely with birth
weights less than 1500 g have decreased growth and lower lumbar
spinal bone mineral content and density relative to term-matched
controls at 5 to 9 years of age.
