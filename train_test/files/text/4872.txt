Introduction
There appears to be intersections and convergences in theo-
retical approaches to the study of national and/or interna-
tional communication, probably because of the apparent
cyclical nature of human progress. Thussu (2000) notes that
"it's not surprising that theories of communication began to
emerge in parallel with the rapid social and economic
changes of the Industrial Revolution in Europe" (p. 53).
Communication at the international level also reflects its sig-
nificance in the growth of "capitalism and empire" following
advances in science and technology. This becomes obvious
when we recognize that a theory like Daniel Lerner's mod-
ernization theory essentially runs through many other theo-
ries. Modernization theory gained patronage from the United
Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) as a way of spreading modernity, and also later
in the 1990s by international nongovernmental organizations
and global media corporations to spread "capitalism on the
wheels of electronics" characterized by calls for open air-
waves and free flow of information. This move was to allow
global media multi-nationals to operate without hindrance
anywhere in the world. The dependency and structural impe-
rialism theories also exemplified how colonial "centers"
(political and economic) perpetrated and benefited from con-
tinual maintenance of their "peripheralities" as dependents.
The capitalist-empire-states, according to Amoda (2000),
reconstitute the developing world with structures and func-
tions, which ensure their dependency; thus, export-import
dependency equals structural dependency in the third world.
The beginning of empire service broadcasting by the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in December 19,
1932, to British colonial outposts typicalizes these theoreti-
cal tendencies. It is noteworthy that Galtung's structural
imperialism theory earlier identified five types of imperialis-
tic exchanges between centers and peripheries (viz: eco-
nomic, political, military, communication, and cultural
flows), which tend to recur in contemporary Information
society; and in media globalization theories'identification of
what Appadurai calls "homogenizing scapes" (viz: eth-
noscapes, technoscapes, financescapes, mediascapes, and
ideoscapes; Appadurai, 1996). It is therefore not surprising
that even in the 21st century Information Age dispensation,
there seems to be the prevalence of a blend of "critical polit-
ical-economy" (Thussu, 2000, p. 81), whereby transnational

Global Drums and Local Masquerades:
Fifty Years of Television Broadcasting in
Nigeria: 1959-2009
Liwhu Betiang1
Abstract
TV broadcasting has been in Nigeria for more than 50 years (1959-2009). Its development has brought about a series
of local responses to global socioeconomic and political environments and "soft" stimuli. This conclusion is based on a
critical, interpretive reading of the history, form, and content of television in Nigeria from Obafemi Awolowo's Western
Nigeria Television in Ibadan through the federal government's reactive establishment of the national network: the Nigeria
Television Authority, and later, states and private television stations. The ultimate deregulation of television broadcasting in
1992, perceived as Babangida's "politically-correct" reaction to the pressures from the Bretton Woods institutions, opened
up national media markets for global penetration, and fast-tracked media globalization and its effects in Nigeria. While
television stations in Nigeria have multiplied in numerical terms, programming/content/form have followed the global market/
technological determinism turning Nigerian TV into localized versions of commercialized western master-scripts with very
little local ideological direction.

businesses, which are supported by their respective national
states, increasingly push for the creation and maintenance of
different "links" and "scapes" in global structures and rela-
tionships. In essence, therefore, the theoretical backbone of a
historical narrative such as this is the persistence of modern-
ization/dependency theories whose links can be seen in other
theories like structural imperialism to 21st century media
globalization theories. We tend to see national broadcasters
replicating global broadcast structures and content on the
one hand, and mutual cooperation between national/interna-
tional organizations or grants/aids toward modernizing
broadcasters in the periphery. What is the nature of this
"soft influence" or subliminal power that these assistance
and aids mean to the receiving nation, or is aid really gratis
and without conditionality in our contemporary globalization
setting?
This reading is based on literature and decades of per-
sonal field observation of TV broadcasting in Nigeria, espe-
cially in its first 50 years, and it looks to see the various
subtle, indirect methods and approaches that dominant cen-
ters and hegemonies deploy to shape the development of the
broadcasting industry in a "peripherality" like Nigeria.
However, it must be stated that this "soft-power" exercised
by regional/global or extra-governmental influences may or
may not have directly influenced the form and even content
of public service TV broadcasting in Nigeria.
Historical Influences in the
Development of TV Broadcasting in
Nigeria
The development of television broadcasting in Nigeria in the
last 50 years has brought about a series of reactive jerks to
the multiple local and global environments. With its umbili-
cal cord in the Radio Distribution Service of the BBC, which
became operational in Nigeria since 1935, this colonial
contrivance was designed to "provide communication link
between the colonial officer with the imperial home"
(Nwuneli, 1985, p. 240). To begin with, the development of
Western Nigeria Broadcasting Corporation (WNBC)
Television as first TV in Nigeria (or Africa), in 1959 as an act
of protest against the colonial governor, John McPherson, by
Obafemi Awolowo, then premier of Western Nigeria,
spawned a model for the spiral of new TV stations as a way
of managing political propaganda through the airwaves.
Both acts conceived later years' paradigm of undue bureau-
cratization and political domination of state media. This
trend has continued today among the nation's public service
broadcasters, whereby the medium is governed by authori-
tarian principles with the political leadership and power elite
dominating and interfering with media content, manage-
ment, and ownership (Lasode, 1994; Maduka, 1998; Opubor,
1985). Like its beginnings, the evolution of TV broadcasting
has continued to be a series of local responses to global
socioeconomic and political promptings.
Folarin (2000) breaks the timeline for television broad-
casting in Nigeria into four distinct phases. The first phase
took off with the establishment of the Western Nigeria
Television/Western Nigeria Broadcasting Service (WNTV/
WNBS) Ibadan in 1959 to the outbreak of the civil war in
1967. The second phase continued from the hostilities in
1970 till the Federal government takeover of television ser-
vices and establishment of the Nigerian Television Authority
(NTA). Even though Folarin considers the beginning of the
civil war as a disruption of broadcasting services, it needs to
be mentioned that the civil war, especially in Eastern Nigeria,
contributed to the evolution of guerilla-style or revolutionary
practice of broadcasting even though it was only transitional
within the Biafran experience. That experience may also
have later contributed to Wole Soyinka's Radio Democrat
(later Radio Kudirat) during Sani Abacha's despotism.
The third phase was marked by the return of broadcasting
to the concurrent legislative list from 1979 through 1990s
when the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) was
established in 1992 (vide Decree 38 and later Act 55 of 1999)
to deregulate the industry. The fourth stage is the era of
deregulated and competitive broadcasting in Nigeria in the
present day, which has witnessed an astronomic rise in the
number of terrestrial and cable TV stations to more than
about 166. This periodization can also be articulated politi-
cally in terms of the First Republic: 1960-1966; First Military
Intervention: 1966-1979; the Second Republic: 1979-1983;
Second Military Intervention-Buhari Years: 1983-1985;
Babangida Years: 1985-1993; Abacha Years: 1993-1996;
Shonekan Transitional Government: 1996-1999; and Third
Republic: 1999-date.
The dominant character of these regimes, as perceptively
noted by Osaghae (2002), was their susceptibility to the
"new-found benevolence" of the West that "could not dis-
guise the self-serving policies of the advanced capitalist
countries, which aimed at perpetuating the peripheralisation
of the underdeveloped countries" (p. 314). Continuing, Nnoli
adds that during the 1980s and 1990s, "Nigerian govern-
ments became powerless to influence not only economic
activities in the international system but also within the
country" (cited in Osaghae, 2002, p. 314). The foregoing
"soft" influences may be read against the above periodiza-
tion and dispositions of the various administrations.
Conceived as a medium for "mass information and
instruction," Awolowo during the commissioning of WNBC
in Ibadan asserted that television "is a powerful influence for
good" that will make our country greater (cited in Lasode,
1994, p. 15). True to his prediction, the station produced
immediate reaction from the eastern and northern regions.
Eastern Nigeria Television (ENTV) followed in October
1960, while Radio Kaduna Television (RKTV) took off in
March 1962, as TV service of the Broadcasting Company of
Northern Nigeria (BCNN).
The Federal Government in response initiated moves in
1962 to establish the Nigeria Television Service (NTS) with
the National Broadcasting Company International (NBCI) of
Betiang 3
the United States as managing partners. This followed the
promulgation of the Wireless Telegraphy Act No. 31 of 1961
(now Cap 469, Laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,
1990; cf. Osinbajo & Fogam, 1991). This Act, however, only
authenticated the already established regional stations. With
it, both state and federal governments could establish and run
broadcast stations on appropriate licenses from the Federal
Ministry of Communications. This Ministry, a forerunner of
today's NBC, was by this Act charged with allocation of
wavelength, regulating output and station location, and
ensuring compliance in line with the International
Telecommunications Conventions.
The objectives of the various stations were the humdrum
roles of educating, informing, and entertaining. Even though
there was a National Communications Policy which drew
inspiration from the Cultural Policy and Constitution, there
has been no definite policy thrust for broadcasting in terms
of grassroots cultural development (Opubor, 2005). This ten-
dency is corroborated by a two-time (1977-1983, 1984-1986)
Director-General of NTA, Vincent Maduka, when he regret-
ted the general lack of form in TV broadcasting in Nigeria:
"we have not attempted to use television for any purpose. We
just ran it as a freewheeling medium, without any clear-cut
objective . . . so any gain we have made is accidental"
(Ukoha, 2000, p. 9). Television has been and remains a
"manipulative one way" medium for governments both at
the federal and state levels to achieve their short-sighted
political ends (Opubor, 2005, p. 236).
With the creation of the Midwest region in 1963 and the
12 state structures in 1967, new TV stations were established
in those states. This was given impetus with the proposed host-
ing of the Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture
(FESTAC) in 1977. Color TV transmission was introduced
first at Benue Plateau Television, Jos, in July 1974. Other
states' TV stations took off accordingly: Rivers State TV
(1974), North Western State TV, Sokoto (1976), Kano State
TV (1976), and Kwara TV (1977). By the end of 1976, there
were nine television stations in Nigeria. The First World Black
and African Festival of Arts and Culture (FESTAC '77) also
made it possible for the television in Nigeria to acquire a
Domestic Satellite System (DOMSAT) to improve transmis-
sion and networking that took effect in April 1976. Apart from
this acquisition, funding improved, with the consequent acqui-
sition of hard and software broadcast materials.
The establishment of the Broadcasting Organizations of
Nigeria (BON) earlier in 1973 contributed to improve and
establish more coordinated broadcasting. Formed as a child
of necessity at the instance of Christopher Kolade, then
Director-General of Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation
(NBC), the members, made up of all regional and state sta-
tions, wanted to present a common front at a West German
organized seminar on broadcasting in Nigeria. The new orga-
nization now served as a platform for exchange of profes-
sional advice, programming, and programs, as well as
personnel exchange, and so on. This also initiated the televi-
sion network idea (Maduka, 1998, p. 113).
The Federal Government in April 1976 annexed state-
owned TV stations that are now about 19 in number. This
authoritarian move was to stem their proliferation, make for
increased central coordination, and enhance program
exchange and networking as well as promote unity. The first
network program was telecasted on April 1, 1976 from
NBC-TV in Lagos. Even though this system created its own
editorial management problems due to diverse cultural dif-
ferences, it forged some mythical ancestral fireside oneness
among Nigerians through its network news, which, however,
remains government-centered, manipulative, politically par-
tisan, and serving more of the ends of leadership than that of
the people (Nwuneli, 1985). This happens most often in
momentous events like mass protests, strikes, or unpopular
elections, which pitch the people against the government.
Probably due to the authoritarian control of state-owned
media through legislation, appointments of chief executive
officers and funding are done by central and state
governments.
The NTA was established in May 1977 through its
enabling Decree No. 24 of 1977. According to Maduka
(1998), the Decree gave NTA monopoly over broadcasting
just like it was with Radio as it stated that "[t]he Authority
shall, to the exclusion of any other broadcasting authority or
any person in Nigeria, be responsible for television broad-
casting" (p. 115). It was also established to carry out the
duties of providing "public service in the interest of Nigeria,
independent and impartial television broadcasting" for
Nigeria, and emphasizing the unity in diversity of its cul-
tures, but with a duty to the federal government. The Decree
also provided for the zoning system with a zonal manage-
ment structure. The six-zone structure was politically moti-
vated to cater for the diverse national cultures and grassroot
coverage and networking, with zonal headquarters in Lagos,
Benin, Enugu, Kaduna, Maiduguri, and Sokoto. Section
11(1) specifically obliges NTA to broadcast government pro-
grams and announcements at its own expense and whenever
requested by an "authorized officer," in the public services of
the Federation as may be declared by the President or gover-
nor of a state. This also includes a provision that theAuthority
shall broadcast materials from an "authorized public officer"
during an emergency (Osinbajo & Fogam, 1991, p. 37). This
provision makes television and radio the first port of call for
power-hungry coup plotters in Nigeria as well as popular
media for political abuse by the so-called democratic
leadership.
This monopoly and centralization of broadcast service on
NTA were unpopular with state governments who felt disem-
powered by the central government. The Constituent
Assembly sitting in 1978 returned to the states the rights to
own broadcast stations, enshrining it in the 1979 Constitution
(Section 26(2)). The NTA was directed to be fair, objective,
4 SAGE Open
and impartial at all times in matters of public and industrial
controversies and other "competing ideas or interests, within
the country" (Maduka, 1998, p. 119). The 1979 Constitution
also provided for private broadcasting in the country even
though this was not realized until 1992 by the Ibrahim
Babangida administration, a move Shehu (2004) considers
ironical as "it took the military to deregulate the broadcast
industry" in Nigeria (p. 19).
However, the fairness and impartiality doctrine could not
be realized by NTA due to continued undue bureaucratic
interference, ethnic politics, and the role conflict in-built in
Nigerian public service radio and television. In spite of
NTA's house codes on electioneering responsibilities, the
Second Republic (1979-1983) pushed the NTA to the lowest
depths of abuse as even NTA personnel rights were threat-
ened with flagrant political interference and domination by
the power centers. In the 1983 and 2003 elections, the media
also acted irresponsibly in consort with the political and rul-
ing party leadership of the time. Interestingly, Nigerian TV
and other media acted as true watchdogs during the 2010
general elections, which validated Goodluck Jonathan's
presidency. State media performance in Nigeria, therefore,
becomes a barometric test for the disposition of political
leadership.
As a result of all these political manipulations, the states
began to establish their state-owned stations. This was to
counteract the NTA stations that had been installed in all the
states of the federation, thus demonstrating Maduka's (1998)
observation that the reason for establishment of TV stations
in Nigeria have always been politically motivated, far and
removed from the professed inherited roles of education,
information and entertainment that BBC public service
broadcasting means. Meanwhile, the cyclical and reactive
development in the media continued.
By 1983, with the abortion of the Second Republic, the
economy had been vandalized and run-aground by the
National Party of Nigeria (NPN) political class; the cost of
running NTA became too high and NTA was running at a
deficit. The new interventionist Muhammadu Buhari gov-
ernment cut down on subvention, and NTA stations were
asked to commercialize in line with the administration's
International Monetary Fund (IMF)­engineered austerity
measures. This development took its toll on the quality of
journalism and programming on television, thus proving as it
were that "intense commercialization" could not cohabit
with public service broadcasting (Maduka, 1998, p. 133).
The Buhari administration promoted a national re-orienta-
tion through radio and television (through his War Against
Indiscipline), promulgated the draconian Decrees 4 and 7
(Public Officers Protection Against False Accusation Decree
and Detention of Persons Decree), and finally abrogated the
NTA Zonal structure.
The latter action was based on the recommendations of
the Christopher Kolade Committee set up in 1984 to consider
rationalizing the NTA. Part of the committee's recommenda-
tions was the two-tier public service model, whereby "state-
ownedtelevision(was)lefttocarryonwiththecommunication
effort and mobilization at grassroot level while NTA concen-
trated . . . on national activities" (Maduka, 1998, p. 136). It is
noteworthy that a management structure that encourages the
development of professional policy and the government's
approach to media regulation reveals what that government
expects from or how it views its citizenry as well as its atti-
tude to power.
According to Lasode (1994), Ibrahim Babangida's admin-
istration embarked on seven government policies, which
directly influenced the development of Television (and radio)
in Nigeria. These policies included the abrogation of Decree
2 of 1984, the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP),
Transition to Civil Rule Program, Mass Mobilization for
Social and Economic Reconstruction and Recovery
(MAMSER), Commercialization (Decree 25, 1988, in Laws
of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1990), and later, the
deregulation of broadcast industry.
These programs again needed the popular promotion and
support from the media as a way of getting legitimacy and
support from the people. Moreover, the StructuralAdjustment
Program, privatization and commercialization programs,
were the "market driven" programs promoted by the IMF,
which Babangida freely espoused in traditional Nigerian
leadership's deference to the dictates of Bretton Woods'
institutions.
Decree 25 of 1988 gave birth to the Technical Committee
on Privatization and Commercialization (TCPC). Among the
90 agencies slated for the exercise were the Federal Radio
Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), NTA, and News Agency of
Nigeria (NAN). In May 1990, Christopher Kolade again
headed another Committee in conjunction with TCPC, to
examine "modalities for commercialization of the NTA and
exploring the feasibility of private radio and television sta-
tions" (Lasode, 1994, p. 43). The final recommendations of
the Kolade/TCPC Committees resulted in the promulgation
of Decree 38 of 1992, which established the NBC and gave it
the enabling instruments to license and regulate operations
of private broadcasting organizations in Nigeria.
The NBC Decree 38 of 1992 was later amended and
strengthened byAmendmentAct 55 of 1999, which expanded
the NBC's role to regulate all federal, state, and private sta-
tions; collect television and radio licenses on behalf of the
broadcast organizations; and ensure qualitative manpower
development in the industry. The argument for deregulated
broadcasting industry was not unconnected with Babangida's
"politically correct" desire to please his western overlords,
especially neo-liberalist USA's Ronald Reagan and UK's
Margaret Thatcher whose economic policies planted the
seeds of modern day economic globalization. The argument
was that "a free market would become the new driving force
for economic growth," and satellite technology was going to
Betiang 5
be the arrowhead of deregulation (Shehu, 2004, p. 19). In
addition, the already thriving example of a deregulated print
media in Nigeria provided a local paradigm to support the
broadcast deregulation argument.
By 2004, there were more than 97 federal government-
owned NTA stations, 32 state-owned stations, 14 private sta-
tions, three Direct-to-Home TV stations, two private direct
satellite television (DSTV) stations, and 37 cable-multipoint
microwave distribution system (MMDS) re-broadcasting sta-
tions in Nigeria, out of a combined total of about 350 radio and
TV stations (NBC, 2004). Today, there are more than 166 TV
stations (terrestrial and cable inclusive) in Nigeria.
Public Service Television
An evaluative narrative of the development of TV in Nigeria
cannot be completed without TV's public service function,
especially as both NTA and states' TV stations profess to be
public service in orientation in view of their BBC ancestry.
Public service broadcasting or the trusteeship model refers to
the operation of broadcasting services in the interest of the
public good. It was a creation that sought to diversify the
airwaves as a way of providing access for other voices and
views, which are excluded by a commercialized broadcast
media. Public service broadcasting, considered as an inven-
tion of the British BBC, is designed to be a nonprofit broad-
casting organization that is operated through public funds
from taxation. Like the BBC, it is charged with the duty of
providing "information, education and entertainment," in the
public interest, even though it becomes problematic to define
the content of the term "public good" (Media Network on the
Review of the Constitution, 1999, p. 30).
However, the trusteeship model of broadcasting aims at
catering for a "pluralist society" with a commitment to the
basic tenet that "radio and TV have specific civic functions
and not simply ways of selling programming or commodities
to the public" (Hutchinson, 1999, p. 156), while its program-
ming is basically aimed at informing and enriching the lis-
tener and viewer. But to meet these public or social
obligations, some basic conditions have to be met by the
organization and the government that run this system on
behalf of its people. These conditions include a secure
method of finance, a strong broadcasting organization with
freedom of programming, a commitment by the organization
to universal coverage, and a regulated system (of manage-
ment) designed to encourage the media practitioners to take
both cultural and political risks (Hutchinson, 1999). Other
reputable national public service televisions with a reason-
able degree of public service content and structure include
South Africa's South African Broadcasting Corporation
(SABC), India's Doordarshan, Iran's Press TV, Germany's
Deutschwelle TV (DWTV), and Canada's Canadian
Broadcasting Network (CBN).
Even though the Nigeria Broadcasting Service was fash-
ioned after the BBC, and the many enabling acts, decrees, or
edicts were to provide broadcasting services for the new
plural entity called Nigeria, Maduka observes that the
enabling laws of the NTA (1977) and FRCN (1978) did not
give specific guidelines on the media's involvement in the
promotion of Nigerian cultural values and entertainment, but
rather concentrated more on news, politics, and other contro-
versial matters. To complicate this scenario, commercializa-
tion, politics, and its propagandist tendencies, systemic
problems of state-appointed managements have posed great
challenges on the NTA in the discharge of its functions in
Nigeria. Because most media enabling laws in Nigeria were
crafted during military regimes, government control of the
nation's public media is very visibly authoritarian (Media
Network on the Review of the Constitution, 1999, p. 23).
In spite of this apparent debilitating scenario newly com-
pounded by a deregulated broadcasting market, Yaya
Abubakar (1998), erstwhile Director-General of Voice of
Nigeria (VON), notes that public service broadcasting in
Nigeria has played a remarkable positive role over the years:
These stations bridge distances and cross language barriers, and
mobilize rural masses for development. They also provide an
exciting platform for political communication and debate;
promote local culture; provide the medium for educational
broadcasting, stimulate national dialogue and consensus; as well
as providing the market place for locally produced goods and
services. (p. 12)
The hyper-capitalism of media globalization has chal-
lenged the practice of public service broadcasting in its pure
form. Beyond this, media globalization with its tradition of
penetrative, market-driven trans-national media practice has
like Buridan's ass placed the management of public service
broadcasting organizations between two opposite attractions:
the nobility of public service broadcasting and the capitalisti-
cally attractive though relentless pull of market-driven
broadcasting.
It is noteworthy that even the BBC, the grand model of
public service broadcasting, has gone through this chequered
threat of restructuring due to changing political dispositions,
cut funding, and the new challenge of the digital information
revolution. But the BBC management responded through
innovative programming, creation of advertising-financed
channels, and the commercial-driven BBC Worldwide, and
like the Indian TV Doordarshan, created more local language
stations all over the world.
The Indian Doordarshan example is a rather unique model
of television broadcasting. The corporation, which also
inherited the BBC model, was deliberately designed to serve
not only the ends of state hierarchies but also for the uplift-
ment of the people in furtherance of an economic national-
ism,whichthethenMinisterofInformationandBroadcasting,
Sushma Swaraj, called "swadeshi" (Fernandez, 2000,
p. 624). Indian TV broadcasting system combines the best
tradition of BBC public service and American market-driven
broadcasting, but within a regional protectionist policy.
According to Chin (2003) "even though transnational media
pose a challenge to a national media system and culture, the
6 SAGE Open
local state still plays a crucial role in regulating domestic
cultural policies and guiding the development of broadcast-
ing" (p. 17). This goes further to show that developing econ-
omies can and should tailor their media systems to fit their
development contexts.
The South African SABC picture shows an equally com-
petitive television environment that has leap-frogged into the
Information Technology Age as though to make up for the
lost years of apartheid. The liberalism and commercialism
that drive the independent cable/satellite and terrestrial
broadcasting sectors is equally matched with a determined,
policied, multi-channel national public service broadcaster
(SABC-TV). The software and content infiltration from the
West and its consequent dissemination over the African con-
tinent appear to be taken for granted by the South African TV
regulators and managers, because of the belief that South
Africa's integration into the world economy will strengthen
her international bargaining power, even at the expense of
weaker African countries. In essence, therefore, the type of
broadcasting system a nation prefers would depend on what
function is expected of the media as well as the nation's eco-
nomic and cultural orientation.
Global Influences and TV Programming
in Nigeria
Schupman identifies the threefold purpose of broadcasting to
be the "maintenance, extension and transmission of a cul-
ture"; even though broadcasting concerns itself with emer-
gent values, it "must concern itself even more with those
transmitted values without which no society can achieve
continuity and stability" (Peigh, 1979, p. 9). Programming is
the art of planning, producing, promoting, and placement of
a program package for broadcast in a broadcasting station. It
involves the planning and identification of values and the
packaging and transmission of those values to a critical audi-
ence. Unlike production per se, programming is a cardinal
management function in any television establishment, even
though the actual spade work is done by the producer who is
a line person in the establishment. A program, which is the
end product of programming, according to the NBC Code is
a unified presentation on radio, television, or cable retrans-
mission that occupies a distinct period with a beginning and
an end (2002).
The evolution of programming in the Nigerian broadcast-
ing industry, like the broadcasting organizations themselves,
has a chequered history. From early 1960s when programs
were wholly imported, and were "equally divided between
local productions and foreign films . . . for the so-called
elite" (Lasode, 1994, p. 157), television broadcasting pro-
gramminghasevolvedthroughasystematic"Nigerianization"
orientation to the programming boom by the close of the
20th century. Farounbi notes that
television at this stage could not be said to be serving any definable
national interest . . . (as) over 80 percent of the total programmes
(which stood at twenty-one hours per week) were foreign; with
the remaining 20 percent being news bulletins, interviews and a
few school programmes. (Lasode, 1994, p. 159)
The programming philosophy and objectives have also
evolved accordingly from pure entertainment in the 1960s
through national self-identity and reconciliation of the many
years of military politics and civil war, through the political
ego-massaging of civilian democratic experiments, to the
present market-driven deregulated democracy of the new
millennium. Maduka notes the "professionalism" of the
1990s but bewails the endangered species of serious devel-
opmental programming driven under by commercialized
broadcasting. "The trend with independents (producers)," he
says, "permeates of freshness, competition and merit. It is
also opening up the medium to anyone who has a claim,"
adding that it is "clearly a movement in the direction of
democratization" (Lasode, 1994, p. 174).
Programming for any effective developmental broadcast-
ing is a painstaking management process, which requires
research into media habits, socio-statistics, and the cultural
environment of the target niche audience, as well as their
opinions and biases concerning the content of the communi-
cation. This process becomes necessary if a two-way collab-
orative communication is desired, a situation where
"everyone generates information (and) everyone receives
information" away from the prevalent medium abuse where
political leaders promote a "manipulative one way form of
communication" in clear breach of the NBC Code stipula-
tions and the political leaders' oaths of office. This abuse is
most prevalent among state-owned stations, which are
invariably treated as extensions of the states' Ministries of
Information and Public Relations, and not public establish-
ments kept alive by tax-payers' money (cf. "The Good, the
Bad & the Bungling," 2003; "Whose Voices, Their Master's
or the Peoples?" 2003). It is interesting to note that during
the January 2012 mass protests against Goodluck Jonathan
government's removal of petroleum subsidy, NTA and state
TV were clearly on the side of government: spreading propa-
ganda, under-reporting, misreporting events, or running
down labor and civil rights personalities, while the private
stations like African Independent Television (AIT) and
Channels TV provided more balanced stories to the admira-
tion of audiences. Even the blood-letting activities of the
Islamist group Boko Haram are hardly reported by public TV
in Nigeria; all these in the name of what state media would
call developmental journalism.
Maduka notices that even though broadcasting laws in
Nigeria are modeled after state controlled public trusteeship
model, the stations' programming still gets dominated by
news, politics, and other controversial matters with little
Betiang 7
attention to Nigerian cultures, values, and indigenous enter-
tainment, concluding that over the years, television has been
run "as a free-wheeling medium, without any clear-cut objec-
tives" (Ukoha, 2000, p. 9). This lack of clear-cut policy and
programming direction stands out when one compares NTA
with public service stations like Iran's Press TV and India's
Doordarshan, which appear more objective in their news
reporting.
Despite increased programming and the presence of inde-
pendent production, commercialization and market-driven
media altered the content of local programming, abolished
and re-introduced the former zonal administrative structures,
brought about rationalization and multi-skilling in NTA and
other TV stations. With deregulation and the entry of private
broadcasters, the motives for most private or some public
licensees have become more commercial, political, and often
personal. One clearly sees a predominance of commercial
and pure-entertainment programs over development pro-
grams that have local cultural relevance. Even a public ser-
vice network like NTA has come under great stress for the
above reason. While NTA headquarters in Abuja and Lagos
do fairly well, network stations are left to their wits to fill up
airtime with cheap commercial and tele-evangelical pro-
grams without consideration for the commercial viability of
their local environments. Where there is local production, the
stations design their programs after western global "formats
that sell" like game-shows, pure entertainment and so-called
actuality programs that ape the Big Brother phenomenon.
This tendency negatively affects the creativity of well-mean-
ing local producers and artists who still bother about local
cultural content beyond postmodern market-oriented pro-
gramming (cf. Betiang, 2009).
In the Nigerian broadcasting environment, the following
factors, events, and happenings have been contributory to
shaping the development of television form and program-
ming since its inception in 1959.
·
· Like South Africa's SABC and India's Doordarshan,
the beginning of broadcasting in these colonial out-
posts grew out of the need for imperial Britain (BBC)
to connect with its colonies abroad. This expansion
and program syndication were achieved through a re-
distribution or "wire service" located at the "bridge-
head" of the colony in Lagos in the case of Nigeria.
·
· The formation of the Broadcasting Organization of
Nigeria (BON) in 1972 facilitated subsequent net-
working, which improved programming quality, shar-
ing of management, and professional techniques
(Maduka, 1998). This also applies to later deregula-
tion days' networking like the defunct State-Owned
Broadcasting Organizations of Nigeria (SOBON) and
the many independent TV and radio production guilds.
·
· The nation's hosting of international festivals like the
All Africa Games in 1973, as well as All Black and
African Festival of Arts and Culture (FESTAC '77),
the Under-18 World Cup in 1999, Commonwealth
Games (COJA) 2003, and the Under-17 World Cup in
2009 somehow stimulated the content of TV broad-
casting industry. The impact on TV form and pro-
gramming came through corporate sponsorship and
local funding for infrastructural upgrading/develop-
ment in the media houses to enhance competence and
coverage, as well as skills sharing and transfer
between national and international content producers.
The aborted Miss World Beauty Pageant in 2002 due
to Muslim religious riots in Northern Nigeria also pro-
duced similar multiplier benefits because some media
establishments were upgraded to global standards to
meet the challenge of providing coverage for the
beauty contest. Maduka (1998) considers this phe-
nomenon as a symbiotic growth between the arts,
sports, and the broadcast media.
·
· There has been some form of collaboration between
the TV in Nigeria and foreign media and development
organizations and governments. Some of these include
the German Deutschwelle TV, former West German
government, Mitchell Beazley Television, and Greater
Washington Educational Television Association
(NETA). Other influences and collaborations include
Commonwealth Broadcasting Organization, BBC-
World Service Trust, Population Communication
International (PCI)/Media Impact, United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), United States' Agency
for International Development (USAID), Planned
Parenthood Federation (PPFN), Department for
International Development (DfID), and Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA), as well
as the McArthur Foundation, United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), United Nations Aid
(UNAID), Global HIV/AIDS Initiative in Nigeria
(GHAIN), European Union-Support for Reforming
Institutions Program (EU/SRIP), and the Australian
High Commission. These organizations, through pro-
gram sponsorship and collaboration, have contributed
to program output and quality as well as empowered
local content providers through training, man power
development using collaborative production and
donation of broadcast equipment. While one may
want to consider these foreign interventions with
some sense of gratitude, it is also discomforting that
sometimes, these foreign bodies use the local media to
propagate their national/cultural ideologies/hegemo-
nies and fill up the gap created by the irresponsibility
of local/national governments with foreign propa-
ganda programming.
·
· Television has been part and parcel of propaganda and
development programming in Nigeria. The many pro-
grams that administrations have used to legitimize
and launder their images include Ethical Revolution,
War Against Indiscipline, Green Revolution, Mass
8 SAGE Open
Mobilization for Social and Economic Reconstruction,
Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), National
Directorate on Employment (NDE), Rebranding
Nigeria Campaign, and National Orientation Agency/
Campaign. Others include Women Trafficking and
Child Labor Eradication Foundation (WOTCLEF),
Subsidy Re-Investment Program (SURE-P), and of
course what has become the goldmine of HIV/AIDS
advocacy. Because of their intrinsic government pro-
paganda content, these programs attract very high
budgets but whose trickle down effects on the broad-
cast media remain significant. The popular program
formats that these government propaganda programs
engender have remained some kind of contribution to
the programming history of television in Nigeria.
·
· There are also programs and television festivals that
have gingered the development of programming and
production on Nigerian television. Through sheer
managerial ingenuity, NTA network and BON initi-
ated and have continued to organize arts and televi-
sion festivals that have become avenues for talent
hunts and promotion of new program formats and cre-
ativity among content providers. Such festivals
include Festival of Plays (begun in 1965), Television
Festival (Telefest, first in 1979), and subsequently
Nigerian Festival of Television Programs, which have
been held annually since 1985. Private broadcasters
have also made their contribution. The local BOB-TV
Program Expo among Nigerian universities' media
departments have made significant impact on local
content generation in the television industry. Today,
the national Abuja Cultural Carnival and the famous
Carnival Calabar have not only engendered the devel-
opment of the performing/promenade arts in Nigeria
but have also provided the raw materials for TV pro-
gramming. This new-look form of carnival culture is
however not indigenous to Nigeria. The Carnival
Calabar for instance has a technical relationship with
Trinidad & Tobago. There are also other sponsored
big-budget, long-running reality shows like the
"Gulder Ultimate Search" and the "Maltina Dance
All"' TV shows sponsored by Nigerian Breweries,
Plc. The "Star Quest" music talent hunt has also pro-
duced new music stars as well as cloned content for
TV programming in Nigeria.
With the deregulation of broadcasting in Nigeria, the birth
of independent producers has enriched programming and
content production in the industry. This development
would not have come without the in-house standards of
professionalism and on-the-job training that forms part of
the personnel development policy of government oper-
ated public service television stations, especially NTA
and FRCN. The Television College at Jos, which has cur-
rently been upgraded to a degree awarding institution
(with its Radio Nigeria training corollary in Lagos) has
made significant input to the broadcast industry. The pub-
lic service tradition of training and retiring staff without
consideration for indispensability has seen many a trained
personnel out of job but who have joined the independent
producers' movement. In addition, the now fashionable
downsizing and rightsizing in 21st century media global-
ization era, and the poor working civil service conditions
invoked on broadcasters, have seen increased motility of
talent among producers who have joined the army of ear-
lier brain-drained names like Laolu Oguniyi, Jab Adu,
Lola Fanikayode, Eddie Ogbonna, state-murdered Ken
Saro Wiwa and Mabel Oboh, etc. It may not be far from
the truth that most producers who have now spawned new
private stations and independent production companies
are products of these public service mother stations.
This tendency has also seen the formation of trade
guilds like the Independent Television Producers
Association of Nigeria (ITPAN), and Frontline
Independent TelevisionAssociation of Nigeria (FITRAN).
The advent of deregulated broadcasting has also brought
about the formation of other guilds like the Motion
Pictures Practitioners Council of Nigeria (MPPCN) with
all its other composite guilds. The many productions of
these guilds have no doubt enriched local content creation
in television broadcasting in Nigeria; as well as encour-
aged professionalism, standardization, networking and
professional discipline. However, this may not be said of
return-on-talent for their members in view of the rampant
acquisition of programmes' composite rights by global
cable companies and the prevalence of digital technolo-
gies, which have encouraged piracy of local creative out-
put. Cheap pirated DVDs contain as many as twenty home
movies; in the same way as cable TV stations float whole
programmes like "Africa Magic," Nollywood, etc, which
play Nigerian movies continually round the clock, with
little returns-on-talents at home.
·
· Despite shortcomings that border on cultural imperi-
alism, deregulation/commercialization of television
broadcasting (handmaids of media globalization) has
also affected Nigerian television content creation. It
will be recalled that following Christopher Kolade's
report on commercialization in 1987, the Babangida
regime drastically reduced government subvention
and expenditure by 40%. Earlier in 1984, 20 FRCN
stations had been shut down, while the rest, NTA sta-
tions and state-owned stations, started commercial
drives. This in a way made the stations to become for
the first time more innovative in programming, even
as it signaled the death-wish for public service broad-
casting. Profit motive became privileged over public
service as commercial programming increased
through the sale of airtime, spots, sponsorships, and
Betiang 9
commercial news coverage. In spite of all these, tele-
vision at both national and state levels has remained
under the bureaucracy of the Ministry of Information
and Culture.
·
· New developments in satellite communication tech-
nology and media globalization have also affected TV
programming and production. This phenomenon has
made it possible for broadcasting organizations, espe-
cially for satellite and cable re-broadcasting stations,
to access the stream of programming on global chan-
nels. These signals are re-broadcast to subscribers,
and even on terrestrial channels owned by state/gov-
ernments. Sophos argues that with the deregulated
media of the 1980s, new networks evolved that were
"designed to provide subscribing stations with twenty-
four hour a day programming formats delivered in
high fidelity stereo via satellite". One such was erst-
while South African content provider TV-Africa,
whose activities were promptly arrested by NBC in
view of the many illegalities in their contractual oper-
ations with Nigerian TV stations. Other commonly
syndicated global and regional transnational media
content providers include BBC World, DW-TV, Cable
News Network (CNN), FOX TV, and British Satellite
TV. Today, Multichoice/MNet's Channel-O and local
content music providers: Nigezee and ProudlyAfrican
dominate the airwaves with foreign and local clones
of western hip-hop culture.
In the same way as these digitized media facilitate content
distribution, the problem of piracy and monitoring have
also quadrupled. This development in digital technology
has in some way also spawned the pervasive Big Brother
template of reality shows, where like the American
"McDonalization" of junk fast food, the Big Brother for-
mat has become a global franchise; a practice that pro-
motes a tradition whereby the mass medium of television
has been reduced to a cultural apparatus for the mass pro-
duction of what Turner calls "celetoids," defined as the
studio production of celebrities from "ordinary people"
outside the circle of the "famous" (2006).
·
· The introduction and popularization of the global sys-
tem of mobile telephony and its convergence in
Internet and other computer-mediated communication
have also influenced content generation and packag-
ing in the Nigerian television industry. Multi-media
production and interactive two-way broadcasting
have been enhanced even though with mixed conse-
quences. The evolution of citizenship journalism
through social media networks, using mobile hand-
held devices, has in some ways enriched broadcast
content with less gatekeeping and monitoring. While
this trend has frustrated state-owned media like NTA
and others who traditionally tailor news stories to suit
their paymasters, the masses' participation and right
to know and talk-back have been strengthened. While
interactive programming on both radio and TV
becomes commonly abused, down-loading and up-
loading of satellite/Internet media fare have also
become common, as well as increased cloning of
cheap commercial-oriented formats. This scenario has
created an ongoing discourse in media chat rooms
about media democratization and the need for respon-
sible journalism.
The consequences of the foregoing on TV programming
and production are obvious in the increased number of inde-
pendent producers, increased number of television stations,
increased AM-broadcasting with ever increasing number and
popularity of telethon programs and programming. There is
also increased and more balanced news reporting on public
service NTA due to the influx of competing private broad-
casters who have liberated Nigerians from the surfeit of
"government say so news," and unfair and nonbalanced
news reporting (Uyo, 2000, p. 24). This credit hardly extends
to "state-owned" public TV stations who still degradingly
abuse these stations as propaganda outfits for state governors
and ruling parties much to the alienation of the citizenry.
But Salihu (2002), an NBC broadcast monitor, concludes
that "essentially, however, whether privately or government-
owned, broadcasting is still largely its master's voice . . . as
the question of true independence is in fact the biggest chal-
lenge before Nigerian broadcasting today" (p. 154). Moreover,
TV screens have continued to pander to western consumerist
values, while entertainment has "surrendered more or less to
foreign programmes that have little or no redeeming values as
far as our culture is concerned" (Uyo, 2000, p. 25). There
appears to be a dearth of indigenous comedy on our TV sta-
tions and the emergence of some unholy marriage between
TV and home videos (VHS), which have tended to dwell
more on occultism and superstition with melodramatic plots
on the ill-informed belief that that is what the audiences want.
TV stations and content providers have failed to understand
that the content provider creates and deserves the audiences
they have through the mass pacification process.
TV programming and production have been besieged by a
myriad of interlocking problems. From all indications, there
is an abundance of imaginative program producers in Nigeria
today, but these also must depend on the "simultaneous
availability of performing, writing and production talent and
production facilities" (Akpan, 1994, p. 87). Such facilities
include what Nigerian producers go to South Africa to access
like the (Sasani) studios, equipment, and technical crews, as
well as Nigeria's God-given variegated scenery from the
Atlantic coast to the Sahara desert, and the multiple tradi-
tions and colorful costumes of 400 ethnic cultures.
Other challenges include the paucity of script-writers and
informed directors who are not necessarily market- but
10 SAGE Open
art-driven, and lack of corporate sponsorship. There is also
the preponderance of foreign and free-to-air cable tele-evan-
gelical programs, which get aired with the false assumption
that they are free-to-air, but which actually carry heavily
embedded western consumerist values that socialize
Nigerians the wrong way. The low motivation of govern-
ment-employed TV producers and hard-to-come-by sponsor-
ship encourage this over-dependence on foreign programs
that are of course cheaper and easier to acquire than local
culturally relevant productions.
The continued attachment of federal/state-owned TV sta-
tions to Ministries of Information constitutes a cog in the
smooth functioning of stations' programming and produc-
tion. The creative artist cannot achieve professionalism with
the strictures of civil service whose goals are not those of
creative culture. The bureaucracy that guides approvals,
unpredictability and changes in appointments and funding
create discontinuity in programming. Other complications of
this situation include politicization of personnel recruitment
and remuneration as well as equipment acquisition.
Ministries' boardrooms recruit staff and personnel and
acquire equipment on behalf of stations; most of which turn
out to be unusable. The civil service attachment has also con-
tributed to the high motility of staff from public stations to
the private ones (who do not provide security of tenure any-
way). Incidentally, the silver lining behind this staff motility
phenomenon is that public stations have become training
grounds for the industry as most of the staff in private sta-
tions and independent markets passed through these public
stations. This can be considered as some kind of silent fulfill-
ment of the public service personnel development calling of
public TV in Nigeria.
Other Local Impacts
Even though TV "bends blurs and blends" (apologies to
Gerbner), its impact is relative. It is obvious from the forego-
ing narrative of TV's history in Nigeria that television has
made various prismatic impacts because there are different
media environments. Beyond the multiplication of stations,
which the global phenomenon of deregulation has engen-
dered, one doubts whether such fragmentation has equaled
access to media for the alienated rural dwellers that neither
have electricity to watch TV nor even get the signal.
Consequently, well-placed persons in both urban and rural
areas resort to patronizing satellite TV as terrestrial TV is out
of reach or nonexistent; Nigeria provides the biggest market
for cable television regional corporations like Multichoice.
On the other hand, urban or metropolitan areas are suf-
fused with TV stations, which fight and glut public space for
niche audiences. But what is the content that they trade with
advertisers for these populations in the developing world?
Advertising admittedly provides the cash for the stations.
But what about the ostensible or subliminal values that
advertising carries? This is why arrowheads of
media globalization shop for cultural converts to sell western
consumerist and cultural values. A 2009 study by this author
shows the ignorance or unpreparedness of our media manag-
ers to manage media globalization due principally to the
managers' inclination to see the world from the perspective
of their pay-masters, who obviously are in business to make
money. Government in Nigeria perceives globalization as an
elixir of development without its post-industrial imperialism
with all its baggage (cf. Betiang, 2009). At the moment, sta-
tions nationwide are struggling to digitize to meet global
media 2015 digital migration standards which the country
cannot input into but must comply, as nations must live or die
by global standards.
From inception in Nigeria, TV has existed for the subver-
sive use of political leadership against the people it pretends
to represent. NTA and public service stations in the states
that are terrestrial and actually have grassroots coverage
often behave like hegemonic extensions of government. The
private stations in the bid to win the people over to them-
selves become sensational, consumerist, and nucleating
around high-population urban zones. Their adventurous pro-
gramming accounts for the high rate of NBC breaches com-
mitted by these stations (Udekwu, 2002). Walter Ofonagoro
(2002), former NTA's DG and Minister of Information
rightly noted that "in Nigeria, there is a strong co-relation
between the posture of those in control of the media and the
professional performance of their workers" (p. 26).
While the economic impact cannot be quantified in an
article of this scope, one can look at it from the point of view
of the global media players, the regional media representa-
tives, the public service stations, and the private-owned sta-
tions. Because one cannot be privy to their annual statements
of accounts, it can only be said that TV broadcasting is a
capital intensive venture, which one dares say has capital
intensive returns, especially in this information age where
information is power. The cost of public TV cannot be quan-
tified. For instance, what is the real cost or opportunity cost
of installing and running three politically motivated NTAsta-
tions littered in almost each of the 90 senatorial districts of
the country? The drain on the economy in terms of imported
broadcast software, hardware, and overheads can only be
imagined.
Culturally relevant local programs like Village
Headmaster, Ichoku, Samanja, Mirror in the Sun, Cock Crow
at Dawn, Nigerian Dances, and Food Basket, Master Mind,
Adio Family, and Checkmate that ruled the airwaves have
disappeared. The reasons are not unconnected to the ever-
present commercialization drive, now cheaper foreign pro-
grams that have come with satellite and media digitization,
the dearth of cultural-minded sponsors and banks that do not
understand the need to provide credit facilities for local con-
tent production; and probably, the ever-present Nigerian
home video. This also invites one to question as to what real
cultural values our Nigerian TV stations promote beyond
materialism, consumerism, and magic quick-fix methods of
Betiang 11
making money which inundate Nigerian airwaves. Neo-
Pentecostal material-minded pastors preach on open air-
waves on prosperity that amounts to sanctification of crime;
a phenomenon that was not there in the early days of TV. The
family with its values has been sacrificed on the altar of con-
sumerist-minded television (cf. Didigu, 2002).
The real impact of TV can therefore be perceived if broad-
cast managers and content providers contemplate the manner
of children and future they hope to create through TV pro-
gramming. This tendency is worsened by the paucity of com-
munity media, which have the potentialities to counterbalance
these new consumerist values and political-economic hege-
monies. Even though the family belt is being re-introduced
on NTA, not much is done about other purveyors of TV con-
tent. The TV content monitor in contemporary Nigeria needs
to broaden his/her periscope to go beyond mere classifica-
tion and exhibition, because the content that media global-
ization technology avails through the airwaves and the open
market needs re-consideration.
Conclusion
This critical, rather celebratory view of 50 years of TV in
Nigeria examined its brief history, public service dimension
and programming and the subtle "modernizing" influences
that have aided its development. These influences and experi-
ences of some public TV managers show how little of deliber-
ate developmental policy there is in public TV broadcasting
and its management. It also shows how much the Industry has
relied on developing itself through reactive responses to global
challenges and prompting from international corporate media,
international NGOs, and other extra-governmental organiza-
tions. There is the need to develop the hardware or form of TV
in Nigeria along with the issues of content. Dependency theo-
rists suggest that one major way of throwing off this syndrome
is to "have some self-sufficiency in the realm of information,
ideas and culture" (McQuail, 2010, p. 255). This will check
our traditional national dependence on outsiders' prompting
for both form and content. This is because the new convergent
TV promises potentialities for more damaging reconfiguration
of our ethnic and national cultures and psyches through its
new soft imperialism.
While the drive for independent production has geared up
in recent times, independent content producers should have
better ways of exhibiting their works other than the current
practice where regional cable providers buy up their works
and rights. Government can persuade the Committee of
Bankers to include the culture industries in their Small and
Medium Industries Equity Investment Schemes (SMIES),
while we await the emergence of culture-dedicated banks in
the country.
Government could also strive to achieve universal access
to TV media through encouraging educational and public
service broadcasting. It is not enough to expand the industry
along commercially determined lines. Instead of fragmenta-
tion of stations, public service stations could establish dedi-
cated channels, like the South African SABC, which may be
wholly commercial, news, and entertainment, indigenous
languages to make for easier management and reach within a
competitive media environment. A deliberate policy on the
management of globalizing media, in the manner of India's
Doordarshan, could also provide a policy direction for the
industry.
Finally, the need to fully latch into the Internet web-cast-
ing age is overdue. Content production and distribution
should begin to explore cyberspace as another platform for
conquest and content dissemination. While this will engen-
der the acquisition of digital literacy, and digital policing on
the part of monitors, it will also expand media access. Above
all, in the midst of this media quagmire, media advocates and
activists, as well as departments of theatre and media studies
should begin to include media literacy and social media prac-
tice and management in their curricula as a way of strength-
ening viewers against local/global subliminal manipulations
of television broadcasting hegemonies.
