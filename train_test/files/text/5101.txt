Introduction
For all students--foreign language learners in particular--
reading has been the main channel for acquiring academic
knowledge. This shows that we should attach great impor-
tance to how reading is viewed as a skill by learners.
Alexander and Filler (1976) define reading attitudes as "a
system of feelings related to reading which causes the learner
to approach or avoid a reading situation" (p. l). Understanding
the role of readers' attitudes is important in that attitude may
affect the level of ability ultimately attained by a given stu-
dent through influencing factors such as engagement and
practice. Attitudes toward reading are formed through past
experiences related to reading, educational background, cul-
tural belief, and success and failure in reading (Day &
Bamford, 1998). McKenna, Kear, and Ellsworth (1995)
found that positive attitudes turn negative as children get
older. This is more evident in children who experience diffi-
culty in reading. Therefore, success or failure in reading is
affected by reading attitudes.
In addition, cultural norms, values, and expectations are
among other factors affecting reading attitudes. For example,
girls have been found to be better readers than boys
(McKenna et al., 1995). This can be associated with cultural
expectations individuals have formed in society regarding
their gender. There are many studies reporting more positive
attitudes in females than males (Logan & Johnston, 2009;
McKenna et al., 1995; Worrell, Roth, & Gabelko, 2007). In
another study, McKenna, Conradi, Lawrence, Jang, and
Meyer (2012) found that females reported more positive atti-
tudes for academic reading while males reported more posi-
tive attitudes toward recreational readings. This shows that
text type and genre also influence reading attitude. Different
reading attitudes may be observed in different sociocultural
contexts.
However, the literature reveals inconsistent results regard-
ing the relationship between reading attitude and reading
achievement. Martinez, Aricak, and Jewell (2008) investi-
gated the relationship between reading attitude, reading abil-
ity, and reading achievement among 76American elementary
children. The findings showed that both reading ability and
reading attitudes significantly predicted reading achieve-
ment. Lazarus and Callahan (2000) measured reading atti-
tudes among children with learning disabilities and found
that they had favorable reading attitudes. They concluded

Attitude Toward Reading: L1 or L2 or
Both

Abstract
L2 reading attitude has been the subject of more recent studies in English as a Foreign Language (EFL), and many have
attempted to define this construct and find its correlates such as gender and L1 and L2 proficiency level. This study builds
on the previous studies and aims at highlighting the connection between L2 and L1 reading attitudes and the degree L2
reading attitude contributes to L2 reading achievement in Iranian EFL context. Participants of the study included 230 male
and female Iranian language learners roughly at intermediate level of English reading proficiency. L2 and L1 reading attitudes
were measured using reading attitude questionnaires, and data were analyzed by employing descriptive statistics, correlation
coefficient, and regression analysis. Results showed that L1 and L2 reading attitudes were highly correlated (r = .71); L1
reading attitude significantly explained 51% of the variance in L2 reading attitude, but between the L1 and L2 reading attitudes,
only L2 reading attitude made unique significant contribution to L2 reading achievement. Findings suggest the importance of
developing positive attitude among L2 learners generally and L2 readers particularly.

that attitude may not be associated with reading ability. In
another study, it was reported that more able readers had
more positive attitudes toward reading (Wigfield & Asher,
1984). Kush, Watkins, and Brookhart (2005) found that poor
readers with positive attitudes kept their positive attitudes
despite experiencing challenges with reading. Interestingly,
reading attitudes generally decline as individuals advance in
school.
Most of the studies mentioned above deal with L1 reading
attitudes while research on L2 reading attitudes has been the
concern of several researchers (e.g., Camiciottoli, 2001; Day
& Bamford, 1998; Yamashita, 2004). Kamhi-Stein (2003)
investigated the relationship between the L1 and L2 reading
strategy used and how beliefs about L1 reading affect L2 read-
ing behavior among four L2 college readers of Spanish and
English. She concluded that students' beliefs about home lan-
guage and reading affect their behavior. For instance, those
who viewed their L1 as an asset translated L2 reading into
their native language purposefully. She believes that more
research is needed to examine the relationships between
beliefs about reading and reading processes. In a study by
Yamashita (2004) on 59 Japanese university students, the find-
ings showed that reading attitudes are generally transferable
between first and second languages but with different transfer-
ability degree. She identified four variables for reading atti-
tude (comfort, anxiety, value, and self-perception), with the
value (what person thinks) as a variable more transferable than
comfort, anxiety, or self-perception (what person feels). She
concluded that merely thinking that reading is beneficial does
not bring enough motivation to read. Her study demonstrated
the importance of reading attitude (particularly how one feels
about reading attitude both in L1 and L2) in improving L2
reader's involvement. In a later study, Yamashita (2007) inves-
tigated the transfer of reading attitudes from L1 to L2 in
Japanese students and found that Japanese students had differ-
ent L1 and L2 reading attitudes. Regression analysis indicated
that a significant proportion of L2 attitudes could be explained
by L1 reading attitude. Yamashita (2007) warned against the
generalizability of the findings due to English as a Foreign
Language (EFL) context of Japan and also several method-
ological limitations of the study.
Although no accurate report has been released regarding
the amount of reading done by Iranians, a few reports point
to the inadequate amount of reading done by young Iranians.
Some have reported an amount of reading between 6 and 7
min per day while another reports 7 min of reading per day.
A variety of factors can be associated to this little amount of
reading among which can be attitude toward reading. The
present study is another attempt to shed more light on the
role of L1 and L2 reading attitudes as represented in the fol-
lowing research questions:
Research Question 1: Is there any significant relation-
ship between L1 and L2 reading attitudes of Iranian
students?
Research Question 2: Does L1 reading attitude predict
L2 reading attitude of Iranian students?
Research Question 3: Do L1 and L2 reading attitudes
predict L2 reading achievement of Iranian students?
To find answers to the above research questions, the follow-
ing methodological issues were taken into account.
Method
Participants
The participants of the study included 230 male and female
English language learners studying at various language
institutes in the North Khorasan province of Iran. Most were
aged between 18 and 28 years and had a variety of education
levels. Based on the results of a Cambridge Preliminary
English Test (PET) as well as the proficiency level reported
by the learners, their level of English reading proficiency
was at the intermediate level. The results of the PET are
shown in Table 1.
Instruments
To achieve the aims of the study, three instruments were
used: (a) a reading proficiency test, (b) L1 and L2 reading
attitude questionnaires, and (c) a reading achievement
test. What follows is the description of these three
measures.
PET.A PET was administered to make sure that learners
were homogeneous with respect to their reading proficiency.
PET is a qualification in EFL developed by Cambridge
ESOL. The test measures the overall language proficiency of
test takers up to B1 level of Common European Framework
of Reference for Languages (CEFR) corresponding to the
traditional level of intermediate language proficiency. As the
participants of the study had just started studying English at
intermediate level, this test could well serve the purpose of
the study. It is worth noting that because the variables under
study were related to foreign language reading and that read-
ing performance was one of the variables, only the reading
section was used in the study.

L1 and L2 reading attitude questionnaires. The present study is
aimed at investigating the connection between L1 and L2
reading attitudes. The needed data were collected through L1
and L2 reading attitude questionnaires, adapted from Lee
and Schallert (2014) and targeted attitude components pro-
posed by Mathewson (1994), that is, feeling (affective), eval-
uative beliefs (cognitive), and action readiness (conative).
Based on the factorial report by Lee and Schallert (2014), the
scales consisted of five factors, namely, cognitive attitudes,
conative attitudes, negative affect, anxiety, and self-assess-
ment. According to Lee and Schallert (2014), cognitive fac-
tor is related to the intellectual, practical, and linguistic
values of reading; conative factor to the actual behavior of
readers; and negative affect and anxiety to negative feeling
about reading and self-assessment to students'perceptions of
their reading competence (see Tables 4 and 5 to find each
item of the questionnaires and the respected factors). Both of
these measures were in Persian to prevent any misleading
information due to possible English linguistic deficiency by
participants. For each item, the students rated the extent to
which they agree with the statement on a 5-point scale with 1
= not at all true of me and 5 = completely true of me. The
original questionnaire contained 30 items which were
reduced to 27 in L1 reading attitude questionnaire after revi-
sion, but it remained the same in L2 reading attitude ques-
tionnaire. To remove any concerns regarding the reliability
of the two scales, they were both piloted on a sample of 30
EFL learners. Table 2 displays the statistics obtained after
administering the two scales to the pilot sample.
As seen in Table 2, mean score of L1 reading attitude is
less than L2 reading mean score, which may be construed as
the more positive attitudes of the participants toward L2
reading rather than L1 reading. However, this should also be
remembered that they were voluntary EFL learners. This
means that they held positive attitudes toward L2 learning as
they were willing to learn English voluntarily. Cronbach's
alpha indicated an index of .86 and .74 for internal consis-
tency of L2 and L1 reading attitudes, respectively.
Reading achievement test. The reading achievement test used
in the present study was the standard reading test used by
language institutes. The reading comprises three passages,
which were similar to the reading passages covered during
the instruction period. Totally, the test contained 15 multiple-
choice questions assessing students'inferencing ability, main
idea extraction, lexical inferencing, and sentence and general
comprehension. To have a better psychological effect on stu-
dents and have a better comparability impression with PET
scores, the obtained scores were multiplied by 3. Therefore,
the minimum score could be 0 and maximum score could be
45. The result of this test was used to calculate the predict-
ability power of L1 and L2 reading attitudes in explaining
the L2 reading achievement.
Procedure
After consulting various private institutes and getting their
consent for using their students as participants of the study,
selection of the participants started. Based on the agree-
ment between the researcher and the language institutes,
the researcher promised to keep the name of institutes and
students confidential. The institutes were asked to provide
the researcher with a list of their intermediate students.
Through consulting the list of intermediate students, 304
students were selected as the initial pool of participants of
the study. Students sat for the PET, and after scoring stu-
dents' paper, students whose scores fell between +1 and -1
standard deviation were selected as the legitimate subjects
of the study. This was to make sure they are roughly homog-
enized in terms of L2 reading ability. In total, 230 students
out of 304 students were chosen to participate in the study.
Next, students completed the L2 and L1 reading attitude
measures after receiving proper guidance and instructions
on how to complete the measures. To score the measures,
students' responses to each item were assigned a value,
ranging from 1 to 5. The value 1 was an indication of total
absence of the truthfulness of the item, and a value of 5
indicated the complete truthfulness of the item for individu-
als. All the scores of the items were added up to reach the
total score of each person regarding their reading attitudes.
A high score was an indication of positive attitude and a
low score was an indication of less positive attitude toward
either L2 or L1 reading attitudes. The collected data were
fed into the SPSS 16 data editor sheet and analyzed through
descriptive statistics, correlation, and multiple regression
function of the software.
Results
The first question of the study was about any relationship
between the L1 and L2 reading attitudes of Iranian students.
To start investigating such relationship, initially, L1 and L2
reading attitude scores of the participants of the study were
dealt with in details. The results of descriptive analysis indi-
cated that, as in the pilot study, students had higher mean
score in L2 reading attitude than in L1 reading attitude.

As is evident in Table 3, students had a mean score of
79.69 (SD = 21.20) for L2 reading attitude, while they had a
mean score of 72.86 (SD = 19.42) for L1 reading attitude,
with students' scores being more dispersed in L2 reading
attitude than in L1 reading attitude. Detailed statistics of the
L2 and L1 reading attitude items are displayed in Tables 4
and 5, respectively. The mean scores in Tables 4 and 5 have
been ordered in a descending manner, which means that the
cognitive factor (items in cognitive factor) received the high-
est scores and the conative factor (items in conative factor)
received the lowest scores in L2 reading attitude scale. In
other words, students were more positive toward the

intellectual, practical, and linguistic values of L2 reading
(cognitive factor) and were less positive toward actual
behavior of L2 reading (conative factor).
However, the highest scores in L1 reading attitude were
related to items from cognitive and conative components of
L1 reading attitude and again the lowest number was related
to items from cognitive factor as well as negative feelings. In
other words, the intellectual, practical, and linguistic values
of L1 reading were among both the most positively and least

reveals that although the least positively viewed items of L2
reading attitude were conative items, conative items in L1
reading attitude in most of the cases were viewed highly
positive. This contradiction can be attributed to EFL context
of Iran which makes L2 reading behavior and access to the
appropriate materials and texts less convenient compared
with the situation for L1 reading.
The differences mentioned above were the most observ-
able ones based on mean scores of the items. However, it was
intended to explore the possible relationship between L1 and
L2 reading attitudes as well, which needed to be documented
through appropriate statistical tests. Accordingly, a Pearson
correlation formula was used to investigate the relationship
between L2 and L1 reading attitudes. Table 6 shows the
results of the Pearson correlation coefficient between L1 and
L2 reading attitudes.
According to the Pearson correlation coefficient output,
L1 and L2 reading attitudes were significantly related, r(230)
= .71, p  .05. This relationship was found to be positive;
therefore, any increase in L1 reading attitude corresponds to
an increase in L2 reading attitude.
Another aim of the study was to understand how well L1
reading attitude predicts L2 reading attitude, which was
explored through regression analysis. Due to the fact that
regression analysis enquires certain assumptions to be met,
first, prerequisite assumptions of regression analysis were
dealt with. According to Pallant (2010), multicollinearity, nor-
mality, linearity, homoscedasticity, and independence of resid-
uals are prerequisite assumptions for carrying out regression
analysis. The above assumptions were checked by consulting
variance inflation factor (VIFs) for multicollinearity, and
normal probability plot (P-P) of the regression standardized
residual and the scatterplot for normality, linearity, homosce-
dasticity, and independence of residuals assumptions.
After establishing the prerequisite assumptions for regres-
sion analysis, the output of regression model was consulted.
As Table 7 shows, L1 reading attitude significantly predicted
L2 reading attitude,  = .74, t(228) = 15.41, p < .001. L1
reading attitude also explained a significant proportion of
variance in L2 reading attitude, R2 = .51, F(1, 228) = 237.58,
p < .001 (see Table 8). Accordingly, it can be concluded that
L1 reading attitude can significantly predict L2 reading
attitude.
The third research question asked how well L1 and L2
reading attitudes predict L2 reading achievement. According
to the obtained results from L2 reading achievement test,
participants of the study scored a mean of 24.00 (SD = 5.03)
with the maximum score of 6.00 and minimum score of 36
(see Table 9).
To find the answer to the third research question, again
regression analysis was sought after examining the prerequi-
site assumptions of multiple regression analysis by checking
VIF normal probability plot (P-P) of the regression standard-
ized residual and the scatterplot. After establishing the prereq-
uisite assumptions for regression analysis, the output of

regression model was consulted. As Table 11 shows, L1 read-
ing attitude did not make a unique and significant contribution
to L2 reading performance,  = .04, t(228) = 0.31, p > 0.05.
However, L2 reading attitude made a unique and significant
contribution to L2 reading performance,  = .29, t(228) = 1.99,
p > .04 (see Table 10). Totally, L1 and L2 reading attitudes
explained a significant proportion of variance in L2 reading
performance, R2 = .11, F(2, 221) = 13.63, p  .01 (see Table
11). Therefore, it was concluded that L1 and L2 reading atti-
tudes significantly predict L2 reading performance.
Discussion
The purpose of the study was to understand how L1 and L2
reading attitudes are connected and how these two explained
L2 reading achievement. Based on the results of the analysis,
it was found that L1 and L2 reading attitudes are highly cor-
related (r = .71) and L1 reading attitude significantly
explained 51% of the variance in L2 reading attitude. Both
L1 and L2 reading attitudes accounted for 11% of the vari-
ance in L2 reading achievement, but, among the two, only L2
reading attitude made unique significant contribution to L2
reading achievement. This may point to the differences in the
kind of attitudes (cognitive, conative, etc.) Iranian EFL
learners hold toward L1 and L2 reading. With respect to the
strong relationship between L1 and L2 reading attitudes,
various explanations can be put forward. Such a strong rela-
tionship can be attributed to values Iranian society put on
reading and literacy. Mastashari and Khodamhosseini (2004)
reported that Iranians in the United States are the most edu-
cated and one quarter of Iranians aged above 25 and living in
the United States have at least a graduate degree.
It can also be hypothesized that L1 and L2 are related and
this relationship affects the reading attitudes as well. In this
regard,previousresearchalsosupportstherelationshipbetween
L1 reading and L2 reading and also between L1 reading atti-
tude and L2 reading attitude. This interrelationship between L1
and L2 has been considered both theoretically and empirically.
For instance, in the theory of Interdependence Hypothesis
developed by, for example, Cummins (1979, 1991), one of the
underlying constructs that join L1 and L2 reading has been
considered common underlying proficiency which posits that
the cognitive skills developed in L1 have the capacity to be
transferred into L2. It can be argued that such transference can
happen to reading attitude and beliefs. Alexander and Filler
(1976) defines reading attitude as "a system of feelings related
to reading which causes the learner to approach or avoid a read-
ing situation" (p. 1), and Smith (1990) defines it as "a state of
mind, accompanied by feelings and emotions, that make read-
ing more or less probable" (p. 215). Accordingly, there is high
possibility that if a person who has positive attitudes toward
reading in L1, he or she has similar attitudes toward reading
though the desire of the person to read L2 texts may diminish
due to L2 language deficiency and the related challenges.
In addition, the Threshold Hypothesis (Alderson, 1984;
Cummins, 1979) stated that to develop a second language, a
certain level of L1 knowledge is needed. Both Threshold
Hypothesis and Interdependence Hypothesis provided the
ground for justifying the relationship between the L1 and L2,
which consequently paves the way for a second justification,
and that is the transference of attitude from L1 to L2.
As shown in the "Results" section of the present article, a
strong relationship was found between L1 and L2 reading
attitudes. In other words, those who generally believe that L1
reading is beneficial to them (cognitive attitude), have posi-
tive feeling toward it (affective attitude), or are involved with
actual reading behaviors may transfer the same attitudes to
the L2 reading. The strong relationship between L1 and L2
reading has also been documented by various researchers
(e.g., Lee & Schallert, 1997; Pichette, Segalowitz, & Connors,
2003; Schoonen et al., 1998), and interestingly, most of these
relationships existed among the L2 readers with higher lan-
guage proficiency, which supports the Threshold Hypothesis.
In a meta-analysis done by Jeon and Yamashita (2014), they
found 10 predictors of L2 reading among which L1 reading
was one of them. With respect to empirical studies directly
related to L1 and L2 reading attitudes, two pioneer works
(Yamashita, 2004, 2007) on the relationship between L1 and

L2 reading attitudes also indicated that L1 reading attitudes
are transferrable to L2 reading.
Apart from the relationship between L1 and L2 reading
attitude, the first difference observed was related to the high-
est mean scores of items between the L1 and L2 reading atti-
tudes. With regard to L2 reading attitudes, students viewed
most positively the cognitive merits of L2 reading or the
intellectual and linguistic benefits of L2 reading. However, it
was the combination of cognitive and conative perspectives
that viewed positively in L1 reading motivation. Such differ-
ences between L1 and L2 reading attitudes have also been
reported by Yamashita (2007). Among the reported differ-
ences, Yamashita also pointed to the fact that students
believed that more practical benefits could be obtained from
L2 reading rather than L1 reading. Considering the nature of
cognitive benefits of reading attitudes, one can infer that this
element of attitude corresponds to the instrumental kind of
motivation (Gardner, 1985) and extrinsic motivation (Noels,
Pelletier, Cl_ement, and Vallerand, 2000). Gardner (1985)
relates instrumental motivation to the potential pragmatic
benefits of L2 proficiency like job promotion or achieving
higher grades, and Noels et al. (2000) talk about sources of
motivation external to learner (tangible benefits) as one of
the sources of motivation. As "motivation is the one of the
main determinants of second/foreign language achievement"
(Dornyei, 1994, p. 273), it is not unexpected that L2 reading
attitude with highest mean score of cognitive attitude best
predicted L2 reading achievement. This analysis suggests the
close association between motivation and attitude in L2
reading similarly taken into account by Tremblay and
Gardner (1995) in their second language motivation model.
In the L1 reading attitude of Iranians, conative attitude
received more attention. Now the question is whether higher
scores of conative attitude could contribute to prediction of
L2 reading due to high correlation coefficient between L1
and L2 reading attitudes. The answer can be both yes and no
regarding the fact that, first of all, the relationship between
L1 and L2 reading attitudes has not always been straightfor-
ward and, second, mere conative attitude or the actual read-
ing behavior particularly of L1 could not be interpreted as
the positive internal desire toward reading. Simply mention-
ing that I go to library for reading L1 texts does not mean that
the person is interested in reading. Instead, it may come from
certain responsibilities expected of students like academic
assignments. This points directly to one of the limitations of
quantitative analysis too as it does not provide enough space
for more dynamic and interpretative investigation. Moreover,
the presence of positive attitude may not necessarily lead to
more L2 reading, and there are demotivating factors as well
causing adverse effects on L2 reading behaviors (Falout,
Elwood, & Hood, 2009). For instance, one may hold a posi-
tive attitude for the practical and intellectual benefits of L2
reading, but certain obstacles like undesirable reading envi-
ronment may prevent him or her from focused and continu-
ous reading.
Conclusion
Based on the results of the present study, L1 and L2 reading
attitudes are strongly related and L1 reading can contribute
to L2 reading, which suggests invaluable implications for
education system. The implications could be more emphasis
on L1 reading and literacy as well as increased awareness for
valuing reading and the related components. Based on
research findings, phonological awareness in L1 contributes
to literacy development in L1 and L2 (Durgunoglu, Nagy, &
Hancin-Bhatt, 1993; Quiroga, Lemos-Britton, Mostafapour,
Abbott, & Berninger, 2001). In this regard, it is suggested
that more research is needed to identify the areas most com-
mon between L1 and L1 reading. Studies on the nature of
reading seem very enlightening in that various components
in L1 and L2 reading could be associated and explored. For
instance, topical knowledge may have positive role in link-
ing the L1 and L2 reading as topical knowledge has been
reported an important component of reading comprehension
in L1 (Johnston, 1984; Recht & Leslie, 1988) and L2
(Brantmeier, 2005; Johnson, 1982; Krekeler, 2006).
Moreover, positive L2 attitude contributed to L2 reading
in the current study which points to the importance of devel-
oping positive attitude among L2 learners generally and L2
readers in particular. The results of the study also suggest
that the use of more qualitative approaches to attitude
research is necessary to obtain richer data with more explan-
atory power.
