Introduction
Vocational education's purpose is to prepare competent
workforce for the needs of work life, which is continually
changing. The concept of professionalism is nowadays
broader than before, and one cannot succeed by only doing
strictly defined routine work (Appelbaum & Batt, 1994;
Barnett, 2001; Boreham, 2002). Lifelong learning skills are
required by employees, for example, ability to cooperate
with colleagues and in professional networks of their fields,
as well as, applying their knowledge to new situations and
managing and developing their work (Engeström, 2001;
Hager, 2001). Work is not only the thing that is learnt but
also the context in which one learns (Guile & Griffiths,
2001).
According to Usher (2009), the professional competence
of an employee is nowadays defined not only based on pro-
fessional substance knowledge but also based on profes-
sional flexibility, lifelong learning, and social skills. Learning
in work life is connected to the participation in the interac-
tion process of the community. An individual acts in the cul-
tural context of his profession and builds his knowledge as a
member of the community in question, first in the margin
and then after increasing knowledge in a more and more
important role (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998, 2009).
Changes in work life toward requiring initiative, interac-
tion, and problem-solving ability have caused reevaluation
of educational activities in vocational institutes. Border
crossing between work life and educational institutes is
desired (Engeström, 2001). According to Tynjälä, Virtanen,
and Valkonen (2005; also Guile & Griffiths, 2001), educa-
tion and training must be planned, implemented, and evalu-
ated together with work life. Finnish vocational education
has met these challenges by deepening contacts with work
life, for example, by arranging learning-at-work periods
which have become an important part of vocational studies.
The demand for work life cooperation also gives rise to
the need for developing teacher competences (Stenström &
Tynjälä, 2009). A vocational teacher must have, besides pro-
fessional and pedagogical competences, communication
skills needed in planning, developing, and evaluating a new
kind of work life­oriented education (Helakorpi, 2007;
Tiilikkala, 2004).
In successful work life cooperation, it is important for
teachers to be aware of the situation in the field of their pro-
fessions (e.g., Boud & Salomon, 2001; Griffiths & Guile,
2004). Various scholars (Cort, Härkönen, & Volmari, 2004;

In-Service Teachers' Learning Through
Integrating Theory and Practice

Abstract
Vocational education aims to prepare competent workforce for the needs of continuously changing work life. A competent
employee does not only carry out routine tasks but is also required to have the ability to act in the communities of practice in
his field and develop his way of working. The challenge of Finnish school-based vocational education has been in creating such
learning environments that promote learning professional knowledge demanded by work life. The challenge has required
vocational teachers to develop their competences in collaboration with employers. The research covers the role of Finnish
vocational teachers' authentic work placement periods in developing competences from the viewpoint of sociocultural
learning. During the work placement period, a teacher furthers his or her competences by working in goal-oriented and
planned ways in the work communities of enterprises or in the public sector of their fields. The purpose of the present
qualitative case study is to increase the understanding of the role of authentic work placement periods in vocational teachers'
competence. Experiences of teachers representing different subjects were studied during their work placement periods. The
results show that work placement period supports the development of teachers' competences and provides prerequisites
for work-based vocational education.

Eerola, 2007b; Tanttu, 2006) have underlined that to increase
the teachers' knowledge of work life and deepen coopera-
tion, the teachers'authentic work placement periods ought to
be developed to correspond to the respective periods of stu-
dents. The work placement periods were designed to span
from 2 weeks to 3 months. During this period, the teachers
work in the jobs of their expertise areas, either in enterprises
or in the public sector.
The Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture started a
developmental pilot project "Competent to Work Markets"
for teachers in autumn 2011 as a part of the ESF (European
Social Fund) projects of 2007-2013.According to the Finnish
Ministry of Education and Culture (2011), work life skills
should be developed during the work placement period and
by participating in continuing education. The aim is to
develop substance knowledge pedagogy as well as to create
facilities to systematic cooperation between the work place
and educational institution.
This research will examine how teachers experienced
work placement periods with respect to both professional
competence and pedagogical development. Professional
knowledge was expected to become updated and profes-
sional awareness strengthened. Work placement periods
were expected to offer possibilities to reflect on the aims,
methods, and assessment criteria of students as well as the
developmental trends in education together with work life
representatives (e.g., Eerola, 2007b; Tanttu, 2006).
One of the authors participated personally in work place-
ment periods and simultaneously acted as a participant
observer in a concert project of vocational music teachers at
conservatory. The project was planned and implemented
together with professional musicians. Six (F = 6) musical
performances were prepared, rehearsed, and presented in
concerts during the years 2005 to 2009. According to the
author's experience, careful planning of the training periods
was very important, because it was directly connected to the
experienced successes. The central aim of all the prepara-
tions was the development of a teacher's personal compe-
tence through the successful realization of the authentic work
placement period.
The author's experiences were in accordance with the
research literature on work life learning, although the imple-
mentation was not typical. The work placement period was
positive concerning professional competence, growth of pro-
fessional awareness, and motivation.
This qualitative case study will examine how working in
professional work communities is connected to the compe-
tence of teachers. The article will approach learning from the
sociocultural viewpoint understanding the development of
competence as constructing new knowledge and skills
through joint processes in the communities of practice (Lave
& Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998, 2009). The research will
explain how acting in the communities of practice in the field
of expertise will affect learning in vocational education con-
texts. The research questions were as follows:
Research Question 1: How is work life learning con-
nected to a vocational teacher's expertise?
Research Question 2: How is acting as a musician in the
workshop connected to learning?
The study will first examine the expertise and sociocul-
tural learning of a vocational teacher. Next, the study will
examine the role of a teacher's work placement periods
from the viewpoint of expertise development. The study
outcomes will then be compared with the researcher's per-
sonal experiences of his work placement periods in the field
of music.
Increasing In-Service Teachers' Professional
Competence
The contents of an in-service vocational teacher's compe-
tence are not permanent. Some researchers (e.g., Boreham,
2002; Guile & Griffiths, 2001; Usher, 2009) have noted that
the needs of work life change as do education, technical
development and production, and action policies.
Organizational structures are flexible. Knowledge of educa-
tional areas, professional practices, and the expectations of
vocational education also change.
In educational research (e.g., Bereiter & Scardamalia,
1993; Hakkarainen & Paavola, 2006), competences and
expertise have been dealt with as practical, experiential
knowledge. It is a feature which shows theoretical knowl-
edge and practical skill as merged into professional compe-
tence. Becoming an expert requires a long and appropriate
process of learning.
However, any experiences do not make an expert
(Bereiter, 2002). In a changing work life, the core of exper-
tise is the ability to solve problems. For that reason, expertise
will develop in the duties which require problem solutions
(Chi, 2006) as well as the ability to adapt the gained knowl-
edge in new situations (Hatano & Inagaki, 1992).
Helakorpi (2007) divides a vocational teacher's expertise
into four competence areas: substance, pedagogy, develop-
ment, and working community (Figure 1). The two first men-
tioned are convergent with Tiilikkala's (2004) classification.
Helakorpi includes interaction and personality in pedagogi-
cal expertise but sees personal and work life­oriented devel-
opmental competences, as well as work community skills, as
separate aspects. They emphasize the reflectivity of a teach-
er's work, that is, ongoing observation and assessment, in
various subareas of expertise as shown in Figure 1.
The figure shows how the development of expertise
requires teachers' continuing reflective observation of their
actions. They have to assess their levels of competence and
set goals for development. At work, they have to try to recog-
nize the developmental goals and improve their achieve-
ments (Ericsson, 2006). Competence requirements
presuppose keeping up with the times and anticipation
of future changes. It is not possible only by acting in a
Virkkula and Nissilä 3
school-centered way, but the teacher has to seek continuing
education and practical experiences in work life (Illeris, 2011).
Social Dimension of Learning
To develop teachers'competences in Finnish vocational edu-
cation, teachers' work placement periods are arranged to
allow for teachers to work in authentic work tasks in the
work places of their own fields (Finnish Ministry of
Education and Culture, 2011). It is typical for these periods
to be committed to sociocultural learning in communities of
practice.
Lave and Wenger (1991) studied the apprenticeship learn-
ing, for example, in West African societies and noticed that
learning was tied to the learners'growing possibilities to par-
ticipate in the activities of the communities. When studying
the learning of a tailor's apprentices, Lave and Wenger
noticed that it was practical work that structured the knowl-
edge and skills needed at work and added to the commitment
to more responsible tasks. Through the experiences of
authentic work tasks, they learnt the process of tailoring
clothes, and the complexity of the tasks increased along with
learning.
Wenger (1998, 2009; also Ardichvili, 2008; Kietzmann et
al., 2013; Wells & Claxton, 2002) suggest that sociocultural
learning takes place in small groups of cooperation, that is,
communities of practice. They are joined together through
three factors: joint enterprise, mutual engagement, and
shared repertoire. The last-mentioned factor refers to the
interaction traditions, artifacts, action, and concepts of the
community. The members have common history and shared
experiences which form the basis of certain ways of acting.
In the learning taking place in communities of practice,
four starting points will be noticed: (a) man is a social crea-
ture which connects learning to social situations, (b)
knowledge is competence connected to a certain matter (for
instance, making music, repairing machines, writing poems),
(c) knowing is participation to attain competence, and (d)
meaning is the output of learning. Learning is connected to
the social interaction of community (Wenger, 1998, 2009).
Reflection between members has an essential role as a
part of goal-oriented communal learning. The starting points
of action, process, and contents (e.g., the decisions made and
conceptions followed from them) are evaluated critically,
which promotes the construction of shared understanding,
learning from others, and questioning everyday beliefs and
matters taken for granted. Subsequently, the organized
understanding will assist in dealing with arising situations
(Mezirow, 2009, 1995).
Wenger's views on the social character of learning can be
seen as a communal interpretation of Russian researcher Lev
Vygotsky's theory on the importance of social relationships
in learning. Vygotsky (1978) presented that learning takes
place at two levels: (a) as inter-psychological construction of
knowledge between individuals in social interaction and (b)
as an individual's intra-psychological process. In these both
interpretations, interaction, action, and concepts have sig-
nificant roles.
Research Design and Method
The aim of this study is to explain how work placement
period is connected to an in-service teacher's competence.
The study examined vocational teachers' (N = 552) experi-
ences during the assignments, based on the reports of several
work placement period projects (Research Question 1) as
well as the researcher's own experiences in work placement
periods in the field of music (Research Question 2).
The research design was a case study and was intended to
be the study of lived experiences. The data sets include
Pedagogical sub-area
- Pedagogical skills
- Mastering of educational processes
Reflection
- Conceptions of learning and education
Sub-area of substance

written reports, background statistics, and classroom action/
context participant observations. The data sources are com-
plementary and yield detailed experiential information
vocalized by the participants. The experiences of vocational
in-service teachers were collected from the reports from the
work life assignments and the researcher's own experiences
from notebook entries recorded during participant observa-
tion. It is typical in case studies to collect material in differ-
ent ways, for example, from written sources, literary
documents, and participant observation (Stake, 1995; Yin,
2009). The procedures make the researcher's knowledge of
the case more many-sided and build the basis of the research
reliability and validity (Kothari, 2004).
The research material was analyzed by content analysis
which is a widely used method in the systematic analyzing of
different materials in qualitative research. When content
analysis is used, the research material is organized themati-
cally for the matter of interest to be interpreted and described
clearly. The actual analysis is done, for example, of a text
which can be either a literal source or written by the research
persons (Schreier, 2012; also Krippendorff, 2004). In this
study, the aim is to examine whether there is evidence of
connections of work placement periods to vocational teach-
ers' competence according to the teachers' own experiences.
The theoretical framework for the examination was created
by sociocultural learning in communities of practice.
Reliability is improved by the triangulation of inferences
across multiple data sources. Case studies often tend to com-
bine various materials and research methods and include sev-
eral researchers in the process. This practice aims to decrease
the influence of a single method on the results. Using multi-
ple methods strengthens validity, when the researchers com-
bine methods which are different from each other, for
example, literal material and personal experiences, in exam-
ining the research objects (Cohen, Manion, & Morrison,
2007; also Denzin, 1988).
Results and Discussion--Advantage
of Work Placement Periods for
Vocational Teacher
The work placement period of multi-subject vocational in-
service teachers means in this context a sequence of planned
training in work communities or enterprises in the teachers'
fields of substance. The work places offer possibilities for
updating and developing professional expertise and give per-
spectives to choose study contents for students to meet the
future needs of work life after qualification (Cort et al.,
2004). The earlier findings concerning teachers' work place-
ment periods and their benefits are introduced here first as a
type of reference material which allows making comparisons
to the new data collected and analyzed for this research.
The information service system of the ESF (2012) lists
altogether 18 different vocational development projects in
Finland from 2001 to 2007. Of them, 15 informed the num-
ber of the participants in the assignments; for a total of 376
teachers. In the Kokeva Start project, carried out over the
years 2003 to 2007, 176 teachers participated in work life
assignments, after which they evaluated their success
(Eerola, 2007a).
The first finding was that according to the project reports
(Eerola, 2007a; ESF, 2012), multi-subject vocational teach-
ers (N = 552) felt that during their work placement periods
they could create genuine interaction that was significant in
the joint development of the education between schools and
work places (cf. Wenger, 1998, 2009). The influence could
be seen both in the promotion of teachers' personal compe-
tences and concrete integration of the school and work place
actions. Personal benefits include all fields of vocational
teachers' professional competences, as Figure 2 shows.
The benefit from the cooperation is based on increased
dialogue. Educational institutions, teachers, and work life
have become closer to each other more productively than
Pedagogical sub-area
- Basics of work-oriented planning and
implementation of teaching
- Basics of guiding and evaluation of
students become clarified
Sub-area of substance
- New work-oriented view on the work of
one´s special area
Sub-area of development
- Engaging work life in the development of
education
- Basics of work life oriented research and
development of teaching
Sub-area of work communities
- Joint projects with work life
- Increase of motivation and coping at work

before (cf. Tanttu, 2006). The teachers' comments in the
present study describe how work placement period offers the
possibility to reflect on daily action, improves expertise, and
thus provokes new ideas concerning the development of edu-
cation (cf. Mezirow, 2009, 1995; Olli, 2011).
I got a chance to do different kind of work than I had earlier got
used to. So the work placement period widened my expertise.
. . . we had very fruitful unofficial discussions at the coffee table
on the challenges of the education for the job in question. . . .
Due to these discussions my thoughts about the realization of
demonstrating vocational skills were changed to a more realistic
direction.
The work life assignment was very rewarding and its contents
many-sided. I went there to get substance knowledge, but I
gained much more. New things and applications showed up
daily in the form of development ideas and practical examples
for teaching.
It was rewarding to realize that previously acquired nursing
expertise still exists in "real work." Outstandingly nice were the
customer contacts and the positive feedback that I have received
from them.
The teachers found it easier to develop teaching methods
toward greater work life orientation when they were con-
cretely aware of the topical practices and policies in the
respective working fields. During work placement period,
the teachers also got an understanding of the situations in
which the students are when they go on their learning-
at-work training. However, they got the understanding of the
challenges that a learning-at-work student brings to the work
life.
Work placement period reminded me of the work life based
attitude and thinking. In a teacher's work thoughts easily circle
around school and teaching. In the future I need closer
cooperation with the enterprises than before.
A learning-at-work student is firstly faced with many new
things; time is spent getting to know the workmates and the
practices of the work place. From the viewpoint of the employer,
relatively a lot of time is spent on the initiation when compared
to the expected benefit.
Second, for educational institutions, work placement
periods offered a tool to observe the quality of education, a
method to widen cooperation networks, a possibility to
develop local and regional work life, and the educational
organization as a service organization (cf. Frisk, 2014;
Tanttu, 2006).
Due to the cooperation, work life was informed, for
example, about the evaluation of a student and of the con-
tents, purposes, and realization of curricula. Work life repre-
sentatives also observed that they had been given a possibility
to influence educational development (cf. Frisk, 2014;
Tanttu, 2006). In Tanttu's (2006) research, 70% of work life
representatives responded that due to work placement peri-
ods teachers "can teach more practically," and 43% responded
that teachers "got new ideas for teaching" (p. 36).
What are the concrete results of work placement periods
in the long term? To summarize, the following outcomes
were found among the multi-subject teachers in the present
research (Eerola, 2007a; ESF, 2012; Frisk, 2014; Olli, 2011;
Tanttu, 2006):
1. Work motivation was improved.
2. Pursuit to maintain and develop work life contacts
was increased.
3. Teaching plans and their implementation were devel-
oped to the direction of work life needs--The con-
nections of learning at work and to educational
institutions were improved.
4. Work places got interested in and were better
informed about education.
5. The quality of learning at work improved.
Work Placement Periods in Music Education
In music education, the aim was to create an interactive
model for cooperation between an institution and work life
which also included in-service teachers' work placement
periods. The starting point was an approach emphasizing
collaboration, interaction, and the context of learning (cf.
Billett, 2002). Essential was the teacher's chance to work
together with a professional musician to plan and implement
performances.
A challenge emerged to integrate the earlier mentioned
aspects and work life cooperation. How can a teacher's work
placement period include active cooperation in both authen-
tic music communities and constructive social interaction?
Tasks connected directly to a musician's work, crossing the
border between education and work life, as well as the proj-
ect work guided by a professional musician were all seen as
functional solutions (cf. Jarvis, Holford, & Griffin, 2003).
Based on the above visions, a method was developed for
music teachers to be suitable to workshop activities during
work placement periods and to help teachers gain as much as
possible from them. In the workshop method, teachers per-
formed concerts together with professional musicians.
Workshops included preparation of the music to be per-
formed, personal instrumental rehearsing, as well as ensem-
ble work. Workshops were concluded with an evaluation
meeting in which the central matters of the final product and
learning were discussed. Figure 3 presents the basic idea of
the activities and the process.
The figure shows that the action model in the workshop
was flexible. It allowed variable productions according to the
themes. Furthermore, the conversion to different needs and
new purposes had been programmed into the model.
6 SAGE Open
The first findings of music workshops, in other words,
resembled that of multi-subject teachers: As a learning envi-
ronment, the music workshops followed contemporary
requirements and served the needs of work life and education
in many ways. Participation at workshops was two-dimen-
sional: It was about participating in workshop activities, but
from a wider point of view, the teacher was also simultane-
ously engaging with the music community, in both of which
the learning experiences were acquired by doing. Central to
workshop activities was to realize the joint enterprise of pro-
ducing music and carrying out a successful performance (cf.
Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998, 2009). This will be
one direction of developing work life assignments in the near
future.
The second finding was the added value of the work place-
ment periods (F = 6) in music; what the author experienced
himself correlates to multi-subject vocational teachers' work
placement periods. The author had the chance to participate
in the music community's activities: test competences and
skills concerning his substance knowledge in respect to the
requirements of the field, for instance, in how to adopt artis-
tically challenging music in a limited time.
Music was challenging especially due to tight comping and
difficult playing parts. I did a lot of preparation work, i.e.,
listening to the original versions, writing down and of course
playing. (TOP 07)
Success in the tasks of the work placement period required
mutual engagement and relevant usage of shared repertoire
from the members of the workshop.
Work placement period thus influenced the motivation of
the music teachers, for instance, through the development of
substance competence. Working together with a professional
musician challenged one to reflect on one's own compe-
tences and development needs. Through goal-oriented coop-
eration and practicing work tasks, the shared result was
attained, which was rewarding (cf. Wenger, 1998, 2009).
The material this time was very challenging. Technically, playing
presented challenges I had not earlier faced. It required a lot of
personal practice. The professional musician represented,
moreover, the top of the world in his expertise and was very
demanding in the relationship with the playing mates. . . . (After
the concert) it was nice to notice how we could perform the concert
material together which felt impossible beforehand. (GH 09)
From a pedagogical point of view the work placement
period made the author better equipped to guide the students'
learning-at-work trainings and to prepare them for the voca-
tional demonstration tests. Reflective interaction and dia-
logue with professional musicians and their interest groups
brought new views on the development and realization of
various parts of qualification requirements (cf. Mezirow,
2009, 1995). Consequently, vocational demonstration tests
via concerts were totally moved into work life, into authentic
work contexts.
The goals of work placement periods were thus attained
considerably well. The author received important experi-
ences about the days of professional musicians and a good
picture of their many-sided work. The thing to be devel-
oped most urgently concerns the length of the periods,
which should be long enough to give a sufficiently clear
picture of the work life of musicians. The author's
personal experience confirms and illustrates the research
outcomes:
The planning of the period started in the previous spring when
we stated the contents and aims. Our idea was to perform the
music of Miles Davis' disc Birth of the Cool according to the
most original versions. . . . Our orchestra consisted of teachers
and professional musicians, to bring the viewpoint of work life
into the activities of the workshop. . . . Work life was also
represented by the concert houses where the performances were
carried out. Marketing and advertising procedures were planned
with them. I got a lot of experience on how to plan and implement
a collaborative concert project in the network of music.
Conclusion
Vocational in-service teachers, both multi-subject and music
teachers are important players in increasing cooperation
between educational institutions and work life. Carefully
planned and skillfully guided work in participants'substance
fields predisposes them to the up-to-date practices of the
field and creates preconditions to benefit from them. Work
life experiences offer them chances to (a) confirm their
knowledge of the practices and work cultures in the field, (b)
evaluate and reflect on the professional theory and practice
of the field, and (c) make good use of refreshed conceptions
to develop practices. Positive experiences from connecting
theory to practice also added to their motivation to work or
study and also the feeling of self-respect.

Cooperation with the professionals in the same field
strengthened the teachers' competence and growth in the
membership of their work communities according to socio-
cultural practices (see Wenger, 1998, 2009). The work place-
ment periods created a basis for a gradually deepening
participation in the activities of the working community (see
Lave & Wenger, 1991). During the work placement period, a
teacher (a) participates in the action of the work community
in authentic work situations and (b) shares joint goals and
takes responsibility for them. (c) The action is based on the
interaction between the members. (d) Knowledge is the com-
petence connected to work, and (e) the members give mean-
ings to competence and reflect on the work.
Cooperation opens opportunities to improve the quality of
education. In-service teachers can develop curricula together
and with work life representatives, develop plans for learn-
ing-at-work periods for teachers and students, develop plans
for vocational demonstration tests, and prepare joint proj-
ects. They can also plan student guidance and assessment
and work for quality assurance. Work life projects have
changed the teacher's role from a school official to the facili-
tator of learning, lifelong learner, cooperator, as well as a
many-sided expert of vocational education. The change of
roles will inevitably influence the work identities of teachers.
In the future, a kind of swapping with work life will deepen
the companionship of educational institutions and work life
and benefit both parties: The teachers will share their theo-
retical understanding and practical knowing with work life
representatives who will offer their collaborators real work
life situations. Thus, both theory and practice will be
intertwined.
Education should be compiled and based on a dynamic
view of learning and teaching. It means education which is
transformative and able to answer new demands. Theoretical
conceptions behind the daily practices should be given atten-
tion to. Besides factual contents, that is, technical skills and
content knowledge, the participants should increase their
skills in acting in work life and their self-knowledge to end
up in self-efficacy and autonomy. We should aim at both life-
wide and lifelong learning and pursue a deep understanding
of dialogical interaction in learning and teaching.
