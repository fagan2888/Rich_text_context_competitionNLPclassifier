ABSTRACT. Objective. Dental care is a major unmet
health need of refugee children. Many refugee children
have never received oral health care or been exposed to
common preventive oral health measures, such as a
toothbrush, fluoridated toothpaste, or fluoridated water.
Oral health problems among refugee children are most
likely to be detected first by pediatricians and family
practitioners. Given the increased influx of refugees into
the United States, particularly children, it is important
for the pediatric community to be aware of potential oral
health problems among refugee children and be able to
make referrals for treatment and recommendations for
the prevention of future oral diseases. The purpose of
this study was to describe the prevalence of caries expe-
rience and untreated decay among newly arrived refugee
children stratified by their region of origin and compared
with US children.
Methods. Oral health assessments were conducted
within 1 month of arrival to the United States as part of
the Refugee Health Assessment Program of the Massa-
chusetts Department of Public Health. The outcome vari-
ables include caries experience and untreated decay. Car-
ies experience is determined by the presence of an
untreated caries lesion, a restoration, or a permanent
molar tooth that is missing because it has been extracted
as a result of dental caries. Untreated caries is detected
when 0.5 mm of tooth structure is lost and there is brown
coloration of the walls of the cavity. Comparisons of the
refugee children with US children in Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data were
made using 2 test of independence and multiple logistic
regression.
Results. Oral health screenings were performed on
224 newly arrived refugees who ranged in age from 6
months to 18 years and had a mean age of 10.6 years (SD:
4.82; median: 10.7 years). African refugees represented
53.6%, with the majority from Somalia, Liberia, and Su-
dan. Eastern European refugees composed 26.8% of the
study sample. The remaining 19.6% come from a number
of countries, such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Mid-
dle East. Refugee children had 51.3% caries experience
and 48.7% with untreated decay. Caries experience in
refugees varied by region of origin, with 38% from Africa
exhibiting a history of caries compared with 79.7% of
Eastern Europeans. The highest proportion of children
with no obvious dental problems was from Africa
(40.5%) compared with 16.9% from Eastern Europe. US
children had caries experience similar to that of refugees
(49.3%) but significantly lower risk of untreated decay
(22.8%). Comparisons between refugee children and US
children found significant differences for treatment ur-
gency, untreated caries, extent of dental caries, and pres-
ence of oral pain. White refugee children, primarily from
Eastern Europe, were 2.8 times as likely to have caries
experience compared with white US children, with 9.4
times the risk of untreated decay compared with white
US children. In contrast, African refugee children were
only half as likely to have caries experience compared
with white US children (95% confidence interval: 0.3-0.7)
and African American children (95% confidence interval:
0.3-0.7). However, African refugee children were similar
to African American children in risk of untreated decay
(odds ratio: 0.94).
Conclusion. African refugee children had signifi-
cantly lower dental caries experience as well as fewer
untreated caries as compared with similarly aged Eastern
European refugee children. They were also less likely to
have ever been to a dentist. Possible reasons for these
findings may include differences in exposure to natural
fluoride in the drinking water, dietary differences, access
to professional care, and cultural beliefs and practices.
The prevalence of caries experience and untreated caries
differed significantly between refugee children and US
children. These differences varied significantly by race.
When refugee children were compared with US children,
the African refugee children had only half the caries
experience of either white or African American children.
However, African refugee children had similar likeli-
hood of having untreated caries as compared with Afri-
can American children, despite that very few African
children had previous access to professional dental care.
These findings are consistent with previous studies on
health disparities in the United States. White refugee
children, primarily from Eastern Europe, were also 3
times as likely to have caries experience compared with
either white or African American children and were 9.4
times as likely to have untreated caries as white US
children. Refugee children are more likely to establish
primary medical care before seeking dental treatment.
With the limited access to dental care among refugees,
pediatricians should be particularly alert to the risk of
oral diseases among refugee children. Pediatrics 2004;

Unmet dental needs are the single most fre-
quently reported health need of children.1,2
Pediatricians and family physicians are a crit-
ical component in oral health as they are often the
first to see these children. In fact, in a national survey
of pediatricians, 90% responded that they had an
important role in identifying dental problems and
counseling families on the prevention of dental car-
ies.3 Because refugee children may be more likely to
establish primary medical care before seeking dental
care, it is important for pediatricians and family phy-
sicians to be aware of the oral health needs of refugee
children.
In 2002, the United Nations estimated that there
were 12 million refugees worldwide.4 They have
been defined as people who are outside their native
country and cannot return because of a well-founded
fear of persecution because of race, religion, nation-
ality, political opinion, or membership in a particular
social group.4 Refugees present with a wide range of
unique health care needs, reflecting conditions in
their native countries, time in migration, and expe-
riences in refugee camps. Refugees' countries of or-
igin reflect current world political conditions. Al-
though during the past 3 decades refugees who
entered the United States were primarily from the
former Soviet Union and Southeast Asia, more re-
cently there have been increasing numbers from
Eastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Central
Asia.5
Many refugees originate from areas where disease
control, diagnosis, and treatment are lacking and
war or civil unrest has disrupted the function of
health care systems. For example, refugee children
frequently experience malnutrition, anemia, and
poor growth6 and are also at an increased risk for
certain conditions, such as hepatitis, intestinal para-
sitoses, latent tuberculosis infection, and dental prob-
lems.7­10 Vastly different health care beliefs, as well
as cultural and linguistic barriers, contribute to their
difficulties in gaining access to health care services in
the United States.
Several studies have noted a high prevalence of
dental disease and unmet dental care needs in refu-
gees. Chilean and Polish refugees in Sweden have
been shown to have poorer oral health status com-
pared with corresponding Swedish population
groups.11 Similarly, refugee children in Holland
were found to have inferior oral health status com-
pared with Dutch children, with 85% of refugee chil-
dren having a history of dental caries.12 In 1986, the
World Health Organization documented high levels
of dental caries in the former Yugoslavia when com-
pared with other Europeans.13 Because of war and
deteriorating socioeconomic conditions, the previ-
ously poor state of oral health in the former Yugo-
slavia has subsequently worsened.14 In 1996, a study
of adult refugees and immigrants in Italy also found
a greater burden of dental problems, with higher
caries prevalence, poorer oral hygiene, and greater
unmet dental needs being particularly high among
Yugoslav refugees.15
In the United States, an assessment conducted in
San Francisco in the late 1980s of recently arrived
refugee and immigrant school children from Asia,
Central America, and the Philippines found that 77%
of the refugee and immigrant children needed dental
treatment, as compared with 25% of comparably
aged US children. In addition, refugee children, as
compared with immigrant children, had more caries
in their permanent teeth but fewer caries in their
primary teeth and fewer serious dental conditions.16
In contrast, a study in Israel of refugees from rural
areas of Ethiopia noted relatively low rates of dental
caries in refugee children, with only 13.2% of 5- to
6-year-olds and 18.2% of 12-year-olds exhibiting den-
tal caries.17 It is interesting that none of these Ethio-
pian children had ever been to the dentist before
emigration to Israel. All foods consumed by these
Ethiopian refugees in their native culture were
homemade without the use of refined sugar, which is
typical of many parts of Africa. Throughout East
Africa, dental caries prevalence is low compared
with developed countries, with a lower prevalence in
rural versus urban areas.18 In addition, differences
have been noted in caries prevalence between high
and low socioeconomic groups, with the prevalence
and severity of dental caries generally higher among
privileged Africans who reside in urban centers,
where sugar consumption is limited to those of a
higher socioeconomic status and considered a lux-
ury. In contrast to the indigenous African rural diet
that is low in refined sugar, refugees are often ex-
posed to dietary changes that may include increased
quantities of refined sugar. Such dietary changes
may be compounded by disrupted family eating pat-
terns within refugee camps, with these new dis-
rupted patterns persisting as refugees resettle in a
new country.18
All newly arrived refugees in the United States are
entitled to a comprehensive health assessment on
arrival through the Federal Refugee Act of 1980
(45CFR§400.107). In Massachusetts, the medical
screening of newly arriving refugees was consoli-
dated in 1995 as the Refugee Health Assessment
Program under the auspices of the Massachusetts
Department of Public Health. The program is con-
tracted to a limited network of clinical sites around
the state. An earlier report by the program's medical
providers noted that 63% of newly arrived refugee
children in Massachusetts had significant oral health
problems, which were the most prevalent health
problems among these children.6 As a result, oral
health assessments by a dental hygienist were incor-
porated into the Refugee Health Assessment Pro-
gram with the establishment of the Program for Ref-
ugee Oral Health (PROH). PROH was first
implemented at the International Clinic of Boston
Medical Center, the largest clinical site in the state.
This report presents data collected in 2001­2002 from
a cohort of refugee children, stratified by their region
of origin. Comparable oral health data from children
who live in the United States was obtained from the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III). The results of these analyses
provide new information on the oral health status of
diverse refugee populations.
e734 DENTAL CARIES OF REFUGEE CHILDREN
METHODS
Refugee Data
Oral health assessments of newly arriving refugees were con-
ducted as part of the Refugee Health Assessment Program starting
in January 2001. This article reports findings from screenings
completed by September 2002. The screenings of refugee children
were performed within 90 days of arrival in the United States. A
dental hygienist visually screened each refugee child by using a
penlight and a disposable mirror. An intra-oral examination was
performed on each child to detect the presence of any oral pathol-
ogy. A parent and/or a child was interviewed about the last
dental visit of the child and whether the child currently had oral
pain. These interviews were conducted through hospital interpret-
ers, when needed. Data were collected from a retrospective chart
review of the medical records. Oral health findings and demo-
graphic information for each refugee child in the study were
recorded. Demographic information included age, gender, race/
ethnicity, and country of origin. The Institutional Review Board of
the Boston University Medical Center approved and monitored
the study.
The Basic Screening Survey of the Association of State and
Territorial Dental Directors was the survey instrument used for
information on caries experience, untreated caries, treatment ur-
gency, and early childhood caries.19 Caries experience is deter-
mined by the presence of an untreated caries lesion, a restoration
(which presumably was once a caries lesion), or a permanent
molar that is missing because it was extracted as a result of dental
caries. Untreated caries is detected when the screener can readily
observe the following criteria: (1) a loss of at least 0.5 mm of tooth
structure at the enamel surface and (2) brown to dark-brown
coloration of the walls of the cavity. Early childhood caries is
defined as any child 3 years old with any 1 of his or her upper
6 primary anterior teeth decayed, filled, or missing as a result of
caries. Treatment urgency code is an estimate of how soon the
child should visit the dentist for clinical diagnosis and necessary
dental treatment. Treatment urgency is classified into the follow-
ing categories: (1) "urgent/emergency care" is defined as needing
treatment within 24 hours for signs and symptoms including pain,
infection, and swelling or soft-tissue ulceration of 2 weeks' du-
ration; (2) "early care" is defined as needing dental treatment that
should be administered within several weeks for problems such as
caries without signs or symptoms, spontaneous bleeding of the
gums, or suspicious white or red soft-tissue lesions; and (3) "no
obvious problem" indicates that the child can forgo dental exam-
ination and treatment until his or her next regular checkup.19
In addition to treatment urgency, the extent of dental caries was
assessed and classified as follows: (1) no obvious caries; (2) 1 to 4
carious surfaces; (3) 5 to 9 carious surfaces; and (4) 10 carious
surfaces. This caries assessment was adapted from an index used
by the US Department of Labor's Job Corp.20
NHANES III Database
Children with dental examinations from the NHANES III da-
tabase were compared with the refugee children. A total of 11296
children between the ages of 2 years of age and 16.9 years of age
were included in this comparison group. Information gathered
from dental examinations was used to construct the following
parameters for comparison with the refugee database: (1) treat-
ment urgency, (2) caries experience, (3) untreated caries, (4) dental
caries, (5) presence of dental pain, and (6) presence of oral pathol-
ogy. Some parameters (treatment urgency, caries experience, un-
treated caries, and dental caries) were created from the dental
information available from the NHANES III database. The
NHANES III database involves complex, multistage sampling in
which racial minorities were oversampled to obtain detailed in-
formation on these groups. To compensate for the complex nature
of sampling, we used weighting in all comparisons involving
NHANES III so that population-based estimates could be ob-
tained.
NHANES III dental screenings were visual/tactile screenings,
whereas the refugee screenings was a visual-only screening. On
the basis of previous studies, these 2 methods are comparable in
the detection of dental caries.21,22
Statistical Analysis
The refugee children were categorized into 1 of 3 regions of
origin: Africa, Eastern Europe, and other. Initial comparisons of
demographic information (age group, race, and gender) and oral
health parameters for these 3 refugee groups were made using 2
tests of independence. Initial comparisons of oral health parame-
ters between the refugee children and US children as represented
by NHANES III were conducted using a weighted 2 analysis to
adjust for the complex sampling of NHANES III.
Multiple logistic regression models were constructed to test the
difference in the prevalence of untreated caries and the prevalence
of caries experience between refugee children and US children
(NHANES III) while adjusting for confounding by age, gender,
and race and effect modification by race. Weighting again was
used to compensate for the complex sampling of NHANES III.
Because only 8 refugee children had the racial classification of
"other" and had a similar distribution of untreated caries and
caries experience to white refugee children, they were grouped
with white refugee children when fitting the multiple logistic
regression models.
RESULTS
The refugee study sample consisted of 224 refugee
children between the ages of 6 months and 18 years
with a mean age of 10.6 years (SD: 4.82; median: 10.7
years). There were 47.3% boys (106 of 224) and 52.7%
(118 of 224) girls. Distribution by race revealed 38.8%
(87 of 224) white, 57.6% (129 of 224) African, and
3.6% (8 of 224) other. African refugee children rep-
resented 53.6% (121 of 224) with the majority origi-
nating from Somalia (25.8%; 31 of 121), Liberia
(21.7%; 26 of 121), and Sudan (18.3%; 22 of 121).
Eastern European refugee children composed 26.8%
(60 of 224) of the study sample and were primarily
from Bosnia. The remaining 19.6% (44 of 224) of
refugee children came from a number of countries, in
particular, Afghanistan/Pakistan (39%; 17 of 44), the
Middle East (18%; 8 of 44), and other countries (43%;
19 of 44). Refugee children were divided into 3 gen-
eral regions: Africa, Eastern Europe, and other (Table
1). 2 tests of independence were conducted to test
whether age, gender, and race varied by region of
origin. No significant differences in the distribution
of age (P  .222) or gender (P  .366) by region of
origin were detected. As expected, the distribution of
race did vary significantly according to region of
origin (P  .001), with refugees from Africa consist-
ing primarily of blacks (95.9%; 116 of 121) and refu-
gees from Eastern Europe consisting primarily of
whites (96.6%; 57 of 59).
When possible, the parent or the child was inter-
viewed about past dental visits and toothbrush use
in his or her country of origin. Because of time con-
straints, data for these parameters were collected for
a subset of the total sample (Table 2). Refugee chil-
dren from Africa were the least likely ever to have
been to a dentist (12.8%) and the least likely to have
used a toothbrush in their home countries (10.2%).
Distribution of treatment urgency, caries experi-
ence, untreated caries, and dental caries varied sig-
nificantly according to region of origin. For treatment
urgency, 5% (6 of 121) of children from Africa were
classified as needing urgent dental care compared
with 32.2% (19 of 59) of children from Eastern Eu-
rope and 13.6% (6 of 44) of children from other areas.
The highest proportion of children with no obvious
dental problems was from Africa: 40.5% (49 of 121).

In contrast, 16.9% (10 of 59) of children from Eastern
Europe and 34.1% (15 of 44) of children from other
areas had no obvious dental problems. Overall, car-
ies experience in the refugee children was 51.3%.
Caries experience also varied by region of origin,
with 38.0% (46 of 121) from Africa exhibiting a his-
tory of caries compared with 79.7% (47 of 59) of
Eastern Europeans and 50% (22 of 244) of children
from other areas (Table 3).
On the basis of 2 tests of independence, differ-
ences among the 3 refugee groups were noted for
caries experience, untreated caries, and dental caries.

e736 DENTAL CARIES OF REFUGEE CHILDREN
Refugee children from Africa had the fewest dental
needs; children from Eastern Europe had the great-
est. Of particular note, 65.2% of African children had
no visible evidence of dental caries, whereas only
22.0% of children from Eastern Europe had no evi-
dence of dental caries. No significant differences
among the 3 refugee groups were detected for oral
pain, presence of early childhood caries, or oral pa-
thology.
In comparisons between refugee children and US
children, significant differences were found between
the refugee children and the US children (NHANES
III) for treatment urgency (P  .001), untreated caries
(P  .001), extent of dental caries (P  .001), and
presence of oral pain (P  .001). In terms of dental
treatment urgency, 77.7% of US children exhibited
"no obvious problem" compared with only 33.0% of
refugee children. Similarly, 77.2% of US children had
no untreated caries, whereas only 51.3% of refugee
children had no untreated caries (Table 4).
Multivariate Analysis
The prevalence of untreated caries differed signif-
icantly between refugee children and US children.
These differences varied significantly by race. When
adjusted for age and gender, white/other refugee
children were 9.4 times as likely to have untreated
caries compared with white US children (95% confi-
dence interval [CI]: 6.1­14.7), 5.4 times as likely com-
pared with African American children (95% CI: 3.4­
8.4), and 4.4 times as likely compared with other US
children (95% CI: 2.7­7.0). In contrast, African refu-
gee children were only twice as likely to have un-
treated caries compared with white US children (95%
CI: 1.4­3.0) and not significantly different from Af-
rican American children (odds ratio [OR]: 1.16; 95%
CI: 0.8­1.7) or other US children (OR: 0.94; 95% CI:
0.6­1.4; Table 5).
White/other refugee children were 4.6 times as
likely to exhibit untreated caries compared with Af-
rican refugee children (95% CI: 2.6­8.2). Children 6
to 12 years of age were 1.6 times as likely to have
untreated caries compared with children 6 years of
age. However, children 12 years old were not sig-
nificantly more likely to have untreated caries com-
pared with children 6 years old. Untreated caries
did not vary significantly by gender.
As to caries experience, white/other refugee chil-
dren were 2.8 times as likely to have caries experi-
ence compared with white US children (95% CI: 1.8­
4.5) and compared with African American children
(95% CI: 1.7­4.5). White/other refugee children were
not significantly more likely to have caries experi-
ence compared with other US children (OR: 1.5; 95%

were only half as likely to have caries experience

and African American children (95% CI: 0.3­0.7).
African refugee children were only one quarter as

White/other refugee children were 5.7 times as
likely to have caries experience compared with Afri-
can refugee children (95% CI: 3.2­10.3). As would be
expected, the prevalence of caries experience in-
creased significantly with age. Children between 6
and 12 years of age were 3.9 times as likely to have
caries experience compared with children 6 years
of age, and children 12 years old were 5.1 times as
likely to have caries experience compared with chil-

DISCUSSION
African refugee children had significantly lower
dental caries experience as well as fewer untreated
caries, as compared with similarly aged Eastern Eu-
ropean refugee children. They also were less likely
ever to have been to a dentist. Possible reasons for
these findings include differences in exposure to nat-
ural fluoride in drinking water, dietary differences,
access to professional care, and cultural beliefs and
practices.
When refugee children were compared with US
children, while taking race into account, the African
refugee children had only half the caries experience
of either white or African American children. African
refugee children had similar likelihood of having
untreated dental caries as compared with African
American children, despite that very few African
refugee children had previous access to professional
dental care. Our results are in agreement with the
low rates of dental caries observed in Ethiopian ref-
ugee children in Israel without previous access to a
dentist,17 as well as with the generally lower caries
prevalence in many parts of Africa.18
In contrast, children from Eastern Europe were
almost 3 times as likely to have caries experience
compared with US children and were 9.4 times as
likely to have untreated caries as white US children.
In addition, Eastern European children were 5.6
times more likely to have caries experience and 4.7
times more likely to have untreated caries compared
with African refugee children, despite generally
greater access to dentists than was found among
African refugees. This high rate of dental caries
among Eastern European refugee children confirms
previous studies that noted high caries prevalence
among refugees from the former Yugoslavia in Ita-
ly15 and a poorer state of oral health13 that subse-
quently worsened as a result of war.14
Differing levels of fluoride in the drinking water
supply may contribute to the differences in the caries
experience between African and Eastern European
refugee children. It has been well documented that
fluoride at an optimal range of 0.7 to 1.2 ppm reduces
dental caries; however, it does not eliminate risk of
the disease.23 In 2001, Project Hope Bosnia conducted
water sampling for fluoride content in parts of the
former Yugoslavia. Unpublished data from Project
Hope indicated that in a number of districts of Sara-
jevo and adjacent areas, fluoride levels were below
0.3 ppm (I. L. Dogon, LDS, RCS, DMD, written com-
munication, May 12, 2003). In contrast, many Eastern
African countries have naturally occurring optimal
levels of fluoride in drinking water with some areas
actually having very high fluoride levels.24,25
However, a more likely explanation for the differ-
ences in caries prevalence is the variations in diet. In
particular, refined sugars are the most important
dietary factor in the development of dental caries.26
The relationship between dental caries and refined
sugar consumption has been well documented, in
both developed and developing countries. In the lat-
ter, as socioeconomic levels rise, so does the amount
of sugar in the diet, typically with corresponding
increases in dental caries.27 Annual per capita sugar
consumption exceeding 15 kg has been associated
with increased prevalence of dental caries.27 The Af-
rican countries from which the refugee children in
this study originated have annual per capita sugar
consumptions ranging from 3.1 kg in Liberia to 14.6
in Sudan and 17.8 in Somalia. In contrast, Bosnia, the
primary origin of Eastern European refugee children
in this study, had an annual per capita sugar con-
sumption of 24.9 kg.27 In the United States, per capita
sugar consumption is among the highest at 32.6 kg.
Detailed nutritional data on the refugees were not
obtained in this study; therefore, we are not able to
address directly the role of diet in explaining the
variation in caries prevalence. Nevertheless, our
findings clearly justify the need to collect such nutri-
tional data prospectively to better understand caries
risk factors in refugee children and their families.
Culture plays an important role in determining
oral health status, primarily through the effects on
oral hygiene practices, dietary patterns, and access
and utilization of professional dental care services. In
particular, refugees face important cultural as well as

e738 DENTAL CARIES OF REFUGEE CHILDREN
socioeconomic barriers to gaining access to care.28
Between 1980 and 2002, almost 2 million refugees
were permanently resettled in the United States.5
With the large number of refugees continuing to be
resettled in the United States, health professionals
will be increasingly called on to understand refu-
gees' past experiences regarding health care and
their cultural concepts of disease to deliver effective
care. For example, traditional oral hygiene practices
vary widely in different parts of the world. Chewing
sticks are a common practice in many parts of Africa,
the Middle East, and Asia. When properly used,
chewing sticks are effective in removing plaque.29 A
recent report suggested that "miswak" chewing
sticks may have an inhibitory effect on the levels of
oral streptococci and, thus, lower the risk of dental
caries.30 Such a finding could be particularly note-
worthy, as many refugees prefer using chewing
sticks as part of their daily oral hygiene regimen
rather than adopting the use of a toothbrush.
Primary care physicians can play a crucial role in
educating newly arrived refugees about personal
oral hygiene practices, the role of fluoride, and use of
preventive oral health services. In addition, these
physicians can often facilitate referrals to dental ser-
vices for the initiation of care. Although some refu-
gee groups may actually have lower rates of caries
than the US population, they will often have other
needs and issues. For example, many Sudanese ref-
ugees have had ritual extraction of incisors and ca-
nines and as a consequence of the resulting tongue
thrusting have significant problems with speech ar-
ticulation, malocclusion, and simple biting and
chewing. Also, the process of acculturation may lead
to adoption of deleterious habits such as a diet with
a high content of refined sugar. In contrast, refugees
such as those from Eastern Europe may have urgent
oral pathology, including severe caries, that require
early and ongoing dental intervention coupled with
education about hygiene and personal practices.
Health education and community outreach efforts
are important elements of successful refugee reset-
tlement programs. The infusion of targeted informa-
tion on appropriate oral health practices and the
facilitation of access to dental care services can ben-
efit existing programs. One key component could
focus on counseling refugees about nutrition, chang-
ing dietary patterns, and the increased susceptibility
to dental caries as the result of increased sugar con-
sumption. The introduction of new oral hygiene
practices for preventing dental caries and periodon-
tal disease could be coordinated into other health
education efforts aimed at enhancing various pre-
ventive self-care health behaviors. Last, information
about the value of regular professional dental care
services in children could be integrated into related
health promotion efforts, such as vaccination pro-
grams and well-child care visits.
The PROH, in collaboration with the Massachu-
setts Department of Public Health's Refugee and Im-
migrant Health Program, has provided a critical link
between oral health care and the refugee community.
In particular, through community outreach educa-
tors, oral health has been incorporated into home
visits and other community outreach activities
throughout Massachusetts. Oral health assessments
of newly arrived refugee are an essential component
of all refugees' health assessments. PROH has effec-
tively integrated oral health into existing medical
care settings to enhance an interdisciplinary ap-
proach to providing client services and patient care.
In particular, the oral examination method that we
have used (Basic Screening Survey) is based on a
simple, visual intra-oral assessment that can be im-
plemented by nondental professionals (eg, nurses
and physicians).
One important limitation of this study is that it
assessed the oral health status of refugee children at
only 1 point in time, shortly after their arrival in the
United States. As discussed earlier, it is plausible that
the refugees' dietary patterns and increased expo-
sure to refined sugars in the United States may result
in increased caries risk. Ideally, these children should
be monitored prospectively to assess changing nutri-
tional patterns and health behaviors that may have
an impact on caries incidence. Studies using data
from the National Vital Statistics System and Na-
tional Health Interview Survey revealed an increased
risk of disability and chronic disease morbidity with
an increasing length of residence in the United
States.31 By additional investigation of these refugees
prospectively, we should be able to develop a more
comprehensive understanding of their dental caries
risk factors so that culturally appropriate prevention
strategies can be established.
