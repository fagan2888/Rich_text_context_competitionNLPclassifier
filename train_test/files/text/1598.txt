OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and mortality in a
representative U.S. sample of older adults.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)
and linked mortality files.
SETTING: Noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population.
PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand four hundred eight
NHANES III participants aged 65 and older enrolled from
1988 to 1994 and followed for mortality through 2000.
MEASUREMENTS: Primary exposure was serum
25(OH)D level at enrollment. Primary and secondary out-
comes were all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD)
mortality, respectively.
RESULTS: During the median 7.3 years of follow-up, there
were 1,493 (44%) deaths, including 767 CVD-related
deaths. Median 25(OH)D level was 66 nmol/L. Adjusting
for demographics, season, and cardiovascular risk factors,
baseline 25(OH)D levels were inversely associated with all-
cause mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 5 0.95,
95% confidence interval (CI) 5 0.92­0.98, per 10 nmol/L
25[OH]D). Compared with subjects with 25(OH)D levels
of 100 nmol/L or higher, the adjusted HR for subjects with
levels less than 25.0 nmol/L was 1.83 (95% CI 5 1.14­
2.94) and for levels of 25.0 to 49.9 nmol/L was 1.47 (95%
CI 5 1.09­1.97). The association appeared stronger for
CVD mortality (adjusted HR 5 2.36, 95% CI 5 1.17­4.75,
for subjects with 25[OH]D levelso25.0 nmol/L vs those
!100.0 nmol/L) than for non-CVD mortality (adjusted
HR 5 1.42, 95% CI 5 0.73­2.79, for subjects with
25[OH]D levelso25.0 nmol/L vs those !100.0 nmol/L).
CONCLUSION: In noninstitutionalized older adults, a
group at high risk for all-cause mortality, serum 25(OH)D
levels had an independent, inverse association with CVD
and all-cause mortality. Randomized controlled trials of
vitamin D supplementation in older adults are warranted to
determine whether this association is causal and reversible.

Although many healthcare professionals previously be-
lieved that the major health problems from vitamin D
were limited to rickets, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia,
there has been intense interest in the role of vitamin D in a
variety of nonskeletal medical conditions during the past
decade.1 Vitamin D insufficiency has been associated with
higher incidences of many medical conditions that affect
mortality risk, including hypertension,2,3 diabetes melli-
tus,4­7 cardiovascular disease (CVD),8­12 cancer,13­17 and
infection.18­21 Vitamin D supplementation appears to mit-
igate incidence of, and adverse outcomes from, these var-
ious diseases.17,22,23
Accordingly, recent evidence suggests that vitamin D
may play a role in mortality risk.11,24,25 Low serum levels of
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), the major circulating
form of vitamin D, have been associated with all-cause
mortality in individuals with end-stage renal disease24 and
coronary artery disease11 and even in the general popula-
tion.25 Further evidence suggests that vitamin D supple-
mentation may lower mortality.26­29 Although older adults
are at high risk for lower 25(OH)D levels1 and mortality,30
the association between vitamin D insufficiency and mor-
tality risk has not been specifically evaluated in older adults.
Older adults are at high risk for vitamin D insuffi-
ciency because of a reduction of 7-dehydrocholesterol, the

precursor for vitamin D in the skin,1 and lower ultraviolet
(UV) B light exposure from lower outdoor activity.31 Fur-
thermore, the incidence of vitamin D insufficiency in older
adults is increasing,32 and currently recommended supple-
mentation doses appear inadequate to support the higher
25(OH)D levels associated with improved general health
outcomes.33,34 Thus, although serum 25(OH)D predicts
all-cause mortality for U.S. adults aged 20 and older,25 this
study sought to evaluate the association between serum
25(OH)D levels and mortality in a sample of adults aged
65 and older representative of the U.S. population, includ-
ing specific evaluation of mortality from CVD.
METHODS
Study Design and Participants
From October 1988 to October 1994, the National Center
for Health Statistics conducted the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), fol-
lowed by the mortality assessment from enrollment through
December 31, 2000. A secondary analysis of this nationally
representative, prospective observational cohort of the
noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population, limited to
older adults (aged !65) was performed. A waiver from the
institutional review boards was received as an exempt
study.
Full details of survey methodology, including sampling,
interview, examination, laboratory measurements, mortal-
ity linkage, ethics approval, and informed consent, are de-
scribed elsewhere.35 Briefly, the survey used a complex,
stratified, multistage probability sample design. NHANES
III oversampled certain subgroups of people, including
low-income persons, adolescents, older adults, African
Americans, and Mexican Americans. Because physical
and laboratory examinations occurred in mobile examin-
ation centers, inclement weather was a challenge during
data collection. To avoid this challenge and improve re-
sponse, the NHANES preferentially scheduled data collec-
tion in the lower latitudes (farther south) during winter
months and higher latitudes (farther north) in the summer
months.36
NHANES III collected household interview data, in-
cluding demographic characteristics and data on health and
nutrition, for 33,994 (85.6%) of 39,695 invited partici-
pants, of whom 5,262 were aged 65 and older The majority
(4,094, 77.8%) subsequently received physical and labora-
tory examination in a mobile examination center or at a
home visit. Participants without reported serum 25(OH)D
measurements (216 missing) and valid mortality data (7
missing) were excluded. Poverty:income ratio (ratio of a
family's income to the poverty threshold of a family of the
same size) was used to assess socioeconomic status; 463
participants without data for this important covariate were
excluded. Thus, 3,408 participants, who represent 24 mil-
lion older U.S. adults, were included in the final analysis.
Serum 25(OH)D levels were similar for excluded and an-
alyzed participants (data not shown).
Definition of Study Variables
From the household interview data, information on self-
reported age, sex, race or ethnicity, and socioeconomic sta-
tus, as measured according to the poverty-income ratio was
analyzed. Smoking history (current smoking and pack-
years), current asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (emphysema or chronic bronchitis) diagnosis from
self-reported history were included. Physical activity was
measured in total metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) and
calculated as the sum of leisure-time physical activities re-
ported during the prior month (as measured for each ac-
tivity by the product of intensity rating, in METS, and
frequency of activity during the month). Factors that are
known to be associated with serum 25(OH)D,31 but with-
out a clear direct relationship to mortality, such as milk
intake and vitamin D supplementation, were not included
in the models because of collinearity.
From the examination data, body mass index was
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square
height in meters. Hypertension was defined as self-reported
physician-diagnosed hypertension, average systolic blood
pressure greater than 140 mmHg at baseline, or average
diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg at baseline.
One to three blood pressure measurements were made at
the baseline data collection. Diabetes mellitus was defined
as self-reported physician-diagnosed diabetes mellitus (ex-
cept gestational diabetes only), fasting (48 hours) blood
glucose of 126 mg/dL or greater at baseline, or nonfasting
blood glucose of 200 mg/dL or greater at baseline. Hyper-
lipidemia was defined as self-reported physician-diagnosed
high cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
of 160 mg/dL or greater, or triglycerides of 200 mg/dL or
greater.
Blood samples collected during the examination were
centrifuged, aliquoted, and frozen to À 701C on site and
shipped on dry ice to central laboratories, where they were
stored at À 701C until analysis. The National Center for
Environmental Health (Atlanta, GA) measured serum
25(OH)D levels using a radioimmunoassay kit after ex-
traction with acetonitrile (DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN). The
date of the examination and laboratory data collection was
used to most accurately adjust for the effect of season on
serum 25(OH)D levels. Estimated glomerular filtration rate
was calculated using the abbreviated Modification in Diet
in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. Serum creatinine
measurements were calibrated to the MDRD standard by
subtracting 0.23 mg/dL from NHANES III values, as pre-
viously described.37
Vital Status and Cause of Death
Mortality outcomes were collected by matching National
Death Index screen or death certificate data from the time of
enrollment until December 31, 2000. Participants were
classified as ``dead'' or, for all participants without a prob-
abilistic match, ``presumed alive.'' The underlying cause of
death was coded using the International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) until 1998 and ICD-10 in
1999 and 2000. The National Center for Health Statistics
subsequently recoded all deaths before 1999 to ICD-10
codes for comparability. CVD mortality was defined as
ICD-10 codes I00-I99 and non-CVD mortality as all other
causes of death.
The primary outcome for the cohort was all-cause
mortality during the follow-up period, and the secondary
1596 GINDE ET AL. SEPTEMBER 2009­VOL. 57, NO. 9 JAGS
outcome was CVD mortality. It was attempted to analyze
cancer and infection-related mortality, but the number of
observations was too small for meaningful analysis; thus,
non-CVD mortality was used as a second category for cause
of death.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 9.0 (Stata-
Corp., College Station, TX). Using survey commands,
the recommended subsample weights for the interview
plus examination data were applied to account for un-
equal probabilities of selection and to accurately repre-
sent estimates for the U.S. population. All results are
presented as weighted values. Variance was calculated
based on NHANES-provided masked variance units,
using the Taylor Series linearization method. All P-values
were two-tailed, with Po.05 considered statistically
significant.
For the primary analysis, serum 25(OH)D levels were
stratified into five groups (o25.0 nmol/L, 25.0­49.9nmol/L,
50.0­74.9 nmol/L, 75.0­99.9 nmol/L, and !100.0nmol/L),
which were chosen a priori based on previously reported
25(OH)D thresholds for improving general health.1,38 It
is likely that consistency of thresholds in the literature,
rather than using percentiles (which vary from study to
study), facilitates integration of multiple studies in the lit-
erature, although a secondary analysis of 25(OH)D deciles
has also been included to evaluate linearity of observed
associations.
Proportions and means with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) were calculated for the selected covariates, according
to 25(OH)D strata. Univariate associations were deter-
mined between characteristics and 25(OH)D levels using
the Pearson chi-square test for categorical variables and
analysis of variance for continuous variables. The associ-
ation between each covariate and mortality outcomes was
evaluated using simple (unadjusted) Cox proportional haz-
ards analysis.
The primary analysis focused on the association be-
tween baseline serum 25(OH)D level and all-cause, CVD,
and non-CVD mortality during follow-up using multivari-
able Cox proportional hazards models. Three different
multivariable models were used, specified a priori, to test
for the independent effect of serum 25(OH)D levels on
mortality. The first model adjusted for age, sex, and race or
ethnicity (all important in adjustment of mortality rates)
and season (important in adjustment of 25(OH)D levels).
Building on the first model, the second model added other
potential confounders: poverty: income ratio, region, body
mass index, physical activity, smoking status, cigarette pack
years, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and
renal function. This model was considered to be fully ad-
justed for subsequent analyses. The third model added po-
tential intermediates to help explain the observed
associations, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
hyperlipidemia, history of myocardial infarction, history
of stroke, and history of cancer (nonskin). Finally, effect
modification by covariates on the associations between
25(OH)D and mortality were formally tested for by adding
interaction terms to the adjusted models.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the weighted NHANES III sample, strat-
ified according to baseline 25(OH)D level, are summarized
in Table 1. The median 25(OH) D level was 66.0 nmol/L.
Women, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans had
lower 25(OH)D levels. Lower socioeconomic status, winter
season, Midwest region, lower physical activity, hyperten-
sion, diabetes mellitus, and history of stroke were also
associated with lower 25(OH)D levels.
During the median 7.3 years of follow-up, there were
1,493 (43.8%) deaths among the 3,408 participants, of
which 767 (51.4%) were related to CVD. The remaining
726 non-CVD deaths could not be further stratified ac-
cording to other causes (e.g., cancer, infection) for valid
analysis because of the small number of individual obser-
vations. The association between baseline characteristics
and all-cause, CVD, and non-CVD mortality are presented
in Table 2. Baseline 25(OH)D level, older age, diabetes
mellitus, history of myocardial infarction, and history of
stroke were most strongly associated with CVD and all-
cause mortality (all Po.05).
In the multivariable models (Table 3), baseline serum
25(OH)D level maintained an independent association with
all-cause mortality, even after controlling for potential con-
founders and intermediate variables. Additionally, the
Kaplan-Meier curves (Figure 1A) demonstrates an imme-
diate and sustained divergence of mortality risk between
25(OH)D strata. Stratification of the mortality outcome
suggested that the association was stronger for CVD than
for non-CVD mortality (Figure 1B, C).
There appeared to be a dose-response association with the
largest risk in the lowest 25(OH)D stratum (o25.0nmol/L).
Additionally, analysis according to deciles suggests that the
association between 25(OH)D and mortality is linear in the
range from 0 to 120 nmol/L (Figure 2), and baseline
25(OH)D levels analyzed as a continuous and linear vari-
able had a strong inverse association with mortality risk
(hazard ratio (HR) 5 0.95, 95% CI 5 0.92­0.98 for every
10-nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D). The association be-
tween 25(OH)D and all-cause mortality was stronger in
participants with diabetes mellitus at baseline than in those
without (HRs 5 0.86 and 0.96, respectively; P for interac-
tion 5 .02). There was no other statistically significant in-
teraction between covariates and the associations between
25(OH)D and all-cause or CVD mortality (data not
shown).
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrated a significant inverse association
between baseline serum 25(OH)D level and mortality risk
in older adults. The association was strong (two time
greater odds of mortality for 25(OH)D level o25.0 nmol/L)
and appeared linear within the range of the data and in-
dependent of demographic factors and other common CVD
and mortality risk factors. Additional strengths of the study
include the generalizability of this large, diverse, nationally
representative sample, the robust measurement of covari-
ates, and the quality of the mortality follow-up data.
These results are consistent with several recent reports
that link vitamin D insufficiency with CVD,8­12 CVD mor-
tality,11 and all-cause mortality risk.11,24,25 The data add to

the existing literature in that the cohort already was at high
risk for mortality, with an overall mortality rate of 44%
during the median 7.3 years of follow-up. For instance, this
rate was higher than recently reported (14% over median
8.7 years of follow-up25 and 23% over median 7.7 years of
follow-up11). A nested case-control study of hemodialysis
patients, a group that is also at higher risk for mortality,
found that lower baseline 25(OH)D levels were associated
with higher 90-day mortality.24 Given the aging population,
and that even a small reduction in mortality could have a
substantial effect on public health, the potential importance
of these findings is large. Additionally, a stronger associa-
tion was found between vitamin D and all-cause mortality
in older adults with diabetes mellitus than in those without.
These results differ from those reported previously25 in
their more-general look at the NHANES III data for adults
aged 20 and older. This age-specific difference may be re-
lated to higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, vitamin D
insufficiency, or mortality in the older cohort in the current
study and requires further study.
The association between vitamin D and mortality was
particularly robust in participants with baseline 25(OH)D
levels less than 25.0 nmol/L and 25.0 to 49.9 nmol/L.
Although these subgroups represented 26% of the current
cohort, epidemiological data suggests that vitamin D in-
sufficiency is increasing in the U.S. population. For instance,
it was recently reported that the proportion of older U.S.
adults with serum 25(OH)D levels less than 25 nmol/L

cause exposure to UVB rays is the primary determinant of

VITAMIN D AND MORTALITY 1599
JAGS SEPTEMBER 2009­VOL. 57, NO. 9
likely that more than one-third of older adults now have
25(OH)D levels of less than 50.0 nmol/L, which is associ-
ated with higher risk for mortality, and few have levels of
100.0 nmol/L or greater, which is associated with the lowest
risk for mortality.
CVD mortality, the leading cause of death in the United
States, appeared to be the primary cause of the greater risk
for all-cause mortality.30 Early epidemiological studies sug-
gested associations between CVD and markers of lower
vitamin D status, including winter season, higher latitudes,
lower altitudes, older age, and darker skin pigmentation.39
Several mechanisms for the protective effect of vitamin D
against CVD have been proposed, including beneficial
changes in cardiac function,40 blood pressure,2,3 arterial
function,41 and inflammatory processes.42 For example,
vitamin D may suppress the renin-angiotensin system43 and
matrix metalloproteinases,44 which are important in blood
pressure control and arterial wall compliance, respectively.
Additionally, other epidemiological studies have found as-
sociations between lower serum 25(OH)D levels and other
cardiovascular risk factors,45 including diabetes mellitus4­7
and metabolic syndrome.46 Although it is likely that CVD is
the major component of the inverse association between
vitamin D and mortality, it has been suggested that vita-
min D may also have a beneficial effect on cancer13­17 and
infection,18­21 which are also important contributors to all-
cause mortality, although the current study was underpow-
ered to individually assess these cause-specific mortality
outcomes.
The present study raises additional concerns about
current recommendations for vitamin D supplementation
(200­600 IU/d),33 which are inadequate for most older U.S.
adults to achieve serum 25(OH)D levels greater than 75.0
to 100.0 nmol/L, the levels that are associated with optimal
general health and lower mortality.1,34,38 For instance,
400 IU or 800 IU per day would raise 25(OH)D levels by
only approximately 11 or 22 nmol/L, respectively,47 which
would be inadequate for many older adults based on the
current analysis. The only clinical trial of vitamin D in the
general U.S. population, the Women's Health Study, failed
to detect any effect of vitamin D and calcium supplement-
ation on CVD mortality and morbidity,48 although that
study used a low-dose vitamin D supplementation (400 IU/d)
and had several methodological concerns.49 A recent meta-
analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials on bone health
found that vitamin D supplementation of 400 to 800 IU per
day reduced all-cause mortality by 7% (95% CI 5 1­13%),
mostly due to CVD and infection-related mortality.26
Higher dose supplementation (e.g., 3000 IU/d), which
may be given safely in monthly dosing,50 is more likely to
raise serum 25(OH)D levels above 100.0 nmol/L in older
U.S. adults and thus may have more-impressive effects on
CVD and all-cause mortality.
There are several potential limitations to this study.
Serum was collected at only one point in time and pre-
ferentially collected in northern states in the summer
and southern states in the winter, although age and season
were controlled for, which limits the potential for biased

results. This prospective cohort was an observational study;
thus, the causality of the association between vitamin D
and mortality requires further study. The study attempted
to address this shortcoming by controlling for known
confounders, but unmeasured confounding could exist.
For instance, although common conditions associated
with CVD and mortality were adjusted for, lower 25(OH)D
levels may be a nonspecific marker of poor general
health, and thus, vitamin D insufficiency may identify
individuals who are less likely to go outdoors and produce
vitamin D from sunlight exposure. Large randomized
controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation are required
to enhance causal inference. Finally, it was not possible
to evaluate individual non-CVD mortality causes of mor-
tality (e.g., cancer, infection) because of limited statistical
power.
In summary, in noninstitutionalized older adults, a
group at high risk for mortality, baseline serum 25(OH)D
levels had an independent, inverse association with
CVD and all-cause mortality. Individuals with baseline
25(OH)D levels less than 50.0 nmol/L appear to be at high-
est risk for mortality, but levels of 100.0 nmol/L or greater
may be necessary for better survival. Current dosage rec-
ommendations for vitamin D supplementation appear to be
inadequate in most older adults to support these higher
25(OH)D levels that are associated with optimal general
health and reduced mortality. Randomized controlled trials
of higher-dose vitamin D supplementation in older adults
are warranted to determine whether this association is
causal and reversible.
