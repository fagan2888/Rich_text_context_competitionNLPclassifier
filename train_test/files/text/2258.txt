Normal human serum has been shown' to exhibit cholesterol-binding proper-
ties upon immunoelectrophoresis on agar gel. The evidence clearly supports
the concept of a specific type of binding of cholesterol by alpha-beta globulin.
Accordingly, the name "transcholesterin" was proposed for the reactive com-
ponent.
In order to evaluate the mechanism of in vitro interaction of cholesterol with
transcholesterin, purified components are desirable. Sober and co-workers2
introduced the use of O-(diethylaminoethyl) (DEAE)-cellulose chromatography
for the fractionation and identification of serum proteins. However, DEAE-
cellulose chromatography of serum proteins failed to resolve them into com-
ponents homogeneous as judged by the criteria of paper electrophoresis.3 There-
fore, it has been necessary to combine electrophoretic separation with column
chromatography in the fractionation of serum proteins. The present com-
munication describes the initial findings in an attempt to isolate and char-
acterize transcholesterin by the combination of zone electrophoresis and the
modified chromatographic procedure and also by chemical analysis and im-
munodiffusion studies.
Materials and Methods.-Human sera: Pooled and individual fresh sera were obtained
from healthy volunteers. The details of the procedure have been described elsewhere'
for the following items: (a) agar-gel immunoelectrophoresis, (b) cholesterol solution in
Teepol "L" (an alkyl sulfate detergent), and (c) transcholesterin assay involving immuno-
electrophoresis.
Lipoprotein and lipoprotein-free serum (LFF) preparations: Lipoprotein fractions at
densities 1.063, 1.10, and 1.21 were obtained in the Spinco preparative ultracentrifuge
according to the method of Havel et al.4 When total lipoproteins and LFF were desired,
the preparative ultracentrifugation was carried out according to the procedure of Lewis
et al.' at solvent density 1.21. All the fractions were adjusted to original serum volume
with isotonic saline. Tests such as paper electrophoresis6 and starch-gel electrophoresis' 8
were performed to determine the purity of the lipoproteins and LFF samples. Further
characterizations of these samples were by the Ouchterlony double-diffusion technique.9
Antisera against human serum lipoproteins: Antisera against human alpha-1, alpha-2,
and beta lipoproteins produced separately in rabbits were obtained from Behringwerke,
A. G., Marburg-Lahn, West Germany.
Total cholesterol determination: A modified Liebermann-Burchard procedures using
the Bausch and Lomb spectronic 505 spectrophotometer to read the density of the color
at wavelength 640 mys was adopted for cholesterol quantitation. The reproducibility of
the analytical procedure was good with a standard deviation of +5%.
Vertical zone electrophoresis: Buffer preparation was described elsewhere (Fig. 5),1
except that the pH was adjusted to 8.6 instead of 8.1. Potato starch powder (Baker
analyzed reagent) suspended in the buffer was slurried into a glass column (2.5 cm in
diameter X 60 cm in length) stoppered at the bottom with a rubber stopper and center-

BIOCHEMISTRY: LINAG AND KRASTEFF
filled with a glass tubing which was filled with a glass-wool and Difco agar gel (2% buff-
ered) to serve as a salt bridge. Excess buffer, which resulted after the starch had sedi-
mented by gravity for 6 hr, was pipetted off. One piece of filter paper disk was put on
the top surface of the packed starch column. Serum or serum protein preparation dis-
solved in the buffer was applied onto the starch column above the paper disk. Then
starch powder was added to the liquid sample, with stirring, to adsorb the sample com-
pletely. Another piece of filter paper disk was layered on the starch medium containing
the sample. More starch slurry was added so that the sample compartment was at least
10 cm below the additional starch medium. A layer of buffered agar gel which served
as a reservoir for buffer covered the top surface. Electrophoretic technique and collec-
tion of fractions were described in an earlier communication.' Identification of serum
protein fractions was performed by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate strips as described
by Kohn" but with Hirschfeld'2 electrode buffer.
DEAE chromatography: DEAE-cellulose obtained from Carl Schleicher and Schuell
Co. (standard no. 70; lot no. 1447; 0.89 meg/gm capacity) was prepared for chromatog-
raphy by the method of Peterson and Sober.'3 A flow rate of 3.0 ml/min was maintained,
and constant aliquots per tube were collected in the GME fraction collector. Serum
sample, adjusted to original buffer condition, was passed through a DEAE column of the
same buffer. The column was eluted with distilled water until the effluent absorbance at
280 mu was less than 0.050, then with 0.05 M buffer (DEAE starting buffer), and finally
with a linear gradient elution14 of 1 M NaCl in a 0.05 M buffer. Different sets of pH
and buffer were used in the separate experiments. The fractions were combined accord-
ing to their respective peaks, lyophilized to small volumes, and dialyzed against distilled
water for 4 hr and finally overnight in 0.154 M NaCl solution. These fractions were as-
sayed for transcholesterin activity and serum proteins identified on cellulose acetate
electrophoresis.
Results.-DEAE column chromatography of a whole human serum at pH 4.75:
Figure 1 represents a chromatographic elution pattern of 20 ml of human serum
(approximately 1.4 gm of protein) at pH 4.75. The transcholesterin activity
is spread out across a wide section of the chromatogram. The last fraction
eluted by 2 M NaCl contained only albumin and was negative in the trans-
cholesterin test. All the other fractions, which have in them alpha-1 and
alpha-2 globulins, exhibited positive transcholesterin activity. Even though
the chromatographic procedure yields more than nine distinct peaks, the sep-
aration of serum proteins in terms of their electrophoretic identities on cellulose
acetate was not clear-cut.
DEAE column chromatography at pH 8.20 of lipoprotein-free serum or D 1.21
infranate: In Figure 2 is shown the effluent diagram obtained with a lipo-
protein-free serum chromatographed on the DEAE-cellulose column. A num-
ber of poorly resolved peaks are evident. The transcholesterin activity was
found in the fractions containing either alpha-1 or alpha-2 globulin, or both.
No transcholesterin activity could be detected in either the isolated gamma globulin
fractions or the purified albumin fractions. It is quite interesting to note that
all the transcholesterin activity is distributed over a fairly large NaCl gradient
elution effluent from 0.13 to 0.48 M NaCl in 0.05 M Tris HCl, pH 8.2.
Vertical zone electrophoresis of whole serum: Figure 3a demonstrates that all
the transcholesterin active proteins are found in a broad zone about 14.5 cm
in length and including a well-defined yellow front band followed by a red
diffused zone. The separation patterns of serum proteins for whole serum (Fig.
3a) were less well defined than for lipoprotein-free serum (Fig. 3c). Since

Medical Electronics, Middleton, Wis.) fraction collector.
the active transcholesterin proteins were found to reside in this broad zone
containing albumin, alpha-1, alpha-2, and possibly beta globulins, the active
fractions from the zone electrophoresis were rerun on a newly prepared starch
column and one of the peak fractions (fraction 9) of Fig. 3a was chosen. The
electrophoretic run is shown in Figure 3b. Again, all the fractions which con-
tained alpha globulins gave positive transcholesterin tests except for the one
fraction of alpha-1 globulin in fraction 7. The positive tests with albumin
fractions 1 and 2 were probably related to contamination of the albumin of
whole serum by alpha-lipoprotein since the albumin of lipoprotein-free serum
separated by zone electrophoresis (Fig. 3c) does not give transcholesterin
activity.
An example of the vertical zone electrophoresis of the LFF is showii in Figure
3c. Alpha-1 globulin moved as a broad zone of approximately 12 cm between
albumin and alpha-2 beta globulins; only two (fractions 4 and 5) of eight alpha-1
globulin fractions gave positive transcholesterin activity, whereas all fractions
containing alpha-2 globulins were positive for transcholesterin activity. It
appears that the transcholesterin active proteins were located in a certain
fraction of alpha-i globulin and in alpha-2 globulin regions of the electrophoresis.
During the course of the isolation and characterization of transcholesterin-
active proteins by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and vertical zone elec-
trophoresis, it became necessary to ascertain the identity of the fractionated
samples.

Further chemical and immunological characterization of serum fractions: Fur-
ther characterizations of the LFF serum and lipoprotein fractions by more
specific and sensitive methods such as chemical and immunodiffusion tech-
niques were carried out.
(1) Analyses for total serum cholesterol on lipoprotein fractions and D 1.21
infranate: The data showed that lipoprotein fraction (D 1.063) LDL contained
68.2 per cent of total serum cholesterol, which is in good agreement with the
value given by Lindgren and Nichols'5 for lipoproteins obtained in this density
range of up to 1.063. High-density lipoproteins such as (D 1.100) HDL2
and (D 1.210) HDL3 gave a combined total of 27.2 per cent for total serum
cholesterol (i.e., 6.9% for HDL2 and 20.3 for HDL3). (D 1.210) HDL3 con-
tained as much as three times the amount of total serum cholesterol as (D 1.100)
HDL2. Despite the fact that (D 1.210) infranate was shown to contain no
measurable total serum cholesterol, its unique character is interesting in that
it is capable of binding free cholesterol in the transcholesterin test.
(2) Transcholesterin test on partially delipidated and nontreated serum frac-
tions: Partial delipidation of serum fractions were conducted according to
the method described by Levy and Fredrickson.16 All nontreated lipoprotein
fractions, (D 1.210) infranate, and whole serum yielded positive transcholesterin
tests, whereas the partially delipidated samples of (D 1.063) LDL, (D 1.100)
HDL2, and (D 1.21) HDL3 did not. Furthermore, (D 1.210) infranate and
whole serum still exhibited positive transcholesterin activity even after they
had been subjected to the delipidation treatment.
From the data presented, a general statement can be made concerning the
stability of transcholesterin or transcholesterins. The transcholesterin activity
in all lipoprotein fractions is destroyed after partial delipidation. In contrast,
the activity in (D 1.210) infranate is stable after it is subjected to the same
treatment.
(3) Serological specificity of serum fractions with rabbit antisera in immuno-
diffusion: The results of the characterization of whole serum, lipoprotein
fractions, and density 1.210 infranate by immunodiffusion technique of Ouch-
terlony9 with or without prior partial delipidation treatment are presented
in Table 1. (D 1.210) HDL3 reacted only with anti-alpha-1 lipoprotein to form
a reaction line. Whole human serum was used as control and reacted with all
three specific antisera. When the various serum fractions were subjected to

prior partial delipidation, none of the treated samples gave a reaction line, but
the delipidated whole serum reacted after immunodiffusion with anti-alpha-i
lipoprotein. (D 1.210) infranate was negative to each of the three specific
antisera by the immunodiffusion test either before or after it was similarly
treated, an indication that it did not contain lipoproteins of the nature dis-
cussed here. The (D 1.210) infranate preparations were thus generally free
of alpha-1, alpha-2, and beta lipoproteins as determined by the Ouchterlony9
double-diffusion procedure with commercial rabbit antisera.
Discussion.-Fractionation of the transcholesterin from lipoprotein-free
serum by vertical zone electrophoresis on starch medium showed that one of the
several separated alpha-i globulins and all of the alpha-2 globulins yielded
positive transcholesterin activity. Similar zone electrophoresis of the whole
serum gave poorer resolution of the protein components. It seems that the
lipoproteins present in the whole serum were smearing the electrophoretic
pattern.
Sober and co-workers2 applied DEAE-cellulose chromatography to the sep-
aration of serum proteins. They found that lipoproteins were eluted in frac-
tions 10 and 11 of a total of 23 fractions.'7 This report and other papers3' 18
have described the use of this technique for serum protein separation with
minor modifications and have produced similar results. There has been an
important need for suitable elution buffers at some pH values to reduce or in-
crease the number of charges on the protein or exchanger. In the present study,
two modified elution buffers (pH 8.2 and 4.75) used in developing the DEAE-
cellulose chromatogram of serum proteins have been described.
The demonstration of transcholesterin activity in the several peak fractions
of the DEAE-cellulose chromatograms containing alpha globulins suggests
that this cholesterol-binding protein may actually comprise a system of several
proteins rather than a single oiie. Hence, it is desirable to investigate further
this class of alpha globulins exhibiting transcholesterin activity by immuno-
logical and by biological assay. For these purposes, adequate amounts of
homogeneous purified materials must be obtained. Additional procedures are
now under study in our laboratory.
Although the mechanism of in vitro interaction of free cholesterol with trails-
cholesterin is not fully established, some experiments involving the technique
of Avigan'9 to measure the relative uptake of C'4-cholesterol by serum frac-
tions from radioactive cholesterol-coated celite 545 have produced evidence
(which will be reported later) that the transcholesterin-positive protein or pro-
teins can bind cholesterol without the use of the detergent Teepol "L". How-
ever, in an earlier communication,' the specificity of the precipitinlike reaction
of transcholesterin was found to be limited to cholesterol and dihydrocholesterol
dissolved in Teepol "L" solution. Close homologues of cholesterol such as
desmosterol, zymosterol, and lanosterol dissolved in Teepol "L" have since
been tested; they were unreactive. The evidence supports the idea that Tee-
pol "L" serves only as a vehicle for cholesterol. The specific reaction would be
dependent in part on the conformation of the protein, while the primary re-

quirement would be contributed by the steric configuration of the cholesterol
molecule.
Summary.-The studies have presented evidence that the protein com-
ponent(s) of lipoprotein-free serum which reacts with cholesterol in immuno-
electrophoresis (termed transcholesterin) resides in the alpha globulins. It is
apparently not a lipoprotein.
The albumin, alpha, and beta globulins were resolved into a number of sub-
fractions of DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, but by this procedure
were not completely separated from each other. Upon zone electrophoretic
separation the lipoprotein-free serum yielded positive transcholesterin activity
in one of the alpha-1 and all of the alpha-2 globulin regions. The electrophoretic
patterns of whole serum were less distinct with considerable cross-contamination
by lipids.
Further characterizations of the lipoproteins, the (D 1.210) infranate, and
the LFF fractions were performed through Ouchterlony immunodiffusion tech-
nique and through chemical analyses for total serum cholesterol. The frac-
tions of LFF with transcholesterin activity did not react with antilipoprotein
sera.
The fact that transcholesterin activity is found in different eluted fractions
of alpha-i and alpha-2 globulins suggests that it may constitute a system of
proteins actively combining with cholesterol.
