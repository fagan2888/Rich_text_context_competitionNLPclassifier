Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to measure the potential impact of business-sector concentration on
economic capital for loan portfolios and to explore a tractable model for its measurement. The
empirical part evaluates the increase in economic capital in a multi-factor asset value model for
portfolios with increasing sector concentration. The sector composition is based on credit
information from the German central credit register. Finding that business sector concentration
can substantially increase economic capital, the theoretical part of the paper explores whether
this risk can be measured by a tractable model that avoids Monte Carlo simulations. We analyze
a simplified version of the analytic value-at-risk approximation developed by Pykhtin (2004),
which only requires risk parameters on a sector level. Sensitivity analyses with various input
parameters show that the analytic approximation formulae perform well in approximating
economic capital for portfolios which are homogeneous on a sector level in terms of PD and
exposure size. Furthermore, we explore the robustness of our results for portfolios which are
heterogeneous in terms of these two characteristics. We find that low granularity ceteris paribus
causes the analytic approximation formulae to underestimate economic capital, whereas
heterogeneity in individual PDs causes overestimation. Indicative results imply that in typical
credit portfolios, PD heterogeneity will at least compensate for the granularity effect. This
suggests that the analytic approximations estimate economic capital reasonably well and/or err
on the conservative side.

Non Technical Summary
An unbalanced exposure distribution of a loan portfolio, either across regional or business
sectors, generally increases the associated credit risk. If credit risk is measured by a single
systematic risk factor, sector concentration is usually not accounted for. The purpose of this
paper is twofold. The empirical part measures the potential impact of business-sector
concentration on the economic capital (or unexpected loss) of several loan portfolios. The sector
composition of these portfolios is based on information from the German central credit register
(Millionenkreditmeldewesen) on the sector composition of real bank portfolios. In this way it is
ensured that our results are representative of real banks.
The model used in the empirical part requires Monte Carlo simulations for the calculation of
economic capital, which can be noisy and time-consuming for the high-confidence levels
typically used for the calculation of economic capital for credit risk. Therefore, in the theoretical
part of the paper we explore a simpler, more tractable model for measuring portfolio risk which
has a closed-form solution for economic capital and only requires input parameters, in particular
exposure size and default probability, on a sector level. The model assumptions of PD
homogeneity in every sector and fully diversified idiosyncratic credit risk are indeed not met by
real credit portfolios. Indicative results nevertheless suggest that the analytic approximation still
estimates economic capital reasonably well for typical credit portfolios and/or errs on the
conservative side.
Nicht technische Zusammenfassung
Forderungskonzentrationen in einem Kreditportfolio, entweder in bestimmten geografischen
Regionen oder in Industrie- bzw. Dienstleistungssektoren, erhöhen im Allgemeinen das
Portfoliorisiko. Wird das Kreditrisiko mit einem Ein-Faktor-Modell gemessen, bleiben
Sektorkonzentrationen üblicherweise unberücksichtigt. Das Diskussionspapier gliedert sich in
einen empirischen und einen theoretischen Teil. Im empirischen Teil wird die mögliche
Auswirkung von Branchenkonzentrationen auf das ökonomische Kapital (oder den unerwarteten
Verlust) von ausgewählten Kreditportfolios bestimmt. Die Sektorverteilung dieser Portfolios
beruht auf Informationen über die Sektorverteilung realer Bankportfolios aus dem
Millionenkreditmeldewesen. Diese Datenbasis soll sicherstellen, dass unsere Ergebnisse
repräsentativ für reale Banken sind.
Das im empirischen Teil verwendete Modell erfordert Monte-Carlo-Simulationen, welche bei
den hohen Konfidenzniveaus, die typischerweise für die Bestimmung des ökonomischen
Kapitals für Kreditrisiken verwendet werden, verrauscht und zeitaufwändig sein können. Aus
diesem Grund untersuchen wir im theoretischen Teil ein einfacheres Modell zur Bestimmung
des Portfoliorisikos, welches eine geschlossene Näherungsformel für das ökonomische Kapital
liefert und nur Eingangsparameter, insbesondere Forderungshöhe und Ausfallwahrschein-
lichkeit, auf Sektorebene verlangt. Zwar sind die in diesem Modell getroffenen Annahmen
homogener Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeiten innerhalb der Sektoren und eines vollständig
diversifizierten firmenspezifischen Risikos in realen Kreditportfolios so nicht erfüllt. Die
Ergebnisse unserer Untersuchungen deuten aber gleichwohl an, dass die Näherungsformel auch
in typischen Kreditportfolios noch relativ gute bzw. konservative Näherungswerte für das
ökonomische Kapital liefert.

Sector Concentration in Loan Portfolios
and Economic Capital1
1. Introduction
The failure of not recognizing diversification within banks' credit portfolios was a key
criticism of the 1988 Basel Accord. The minimum regulatory capital requirements (Pillar 1)
even in the internal ratings based (IRB) approach of the Basel Framework of June 2004,
however, still do not differentiate between portfolios with different grades of diversification.
Recognizing that banks' portfolios can exhibit credit risk concentrations, Basel II stipulates
that this risk be addressed in the supervisory review process (Pillar 2), thus creating a need for
an appropriate methodology to measure this risk.
Concentration risk in banks' credit portfolios arises either from an excessive exposure to
certain names (often referred to as name concentration or coarse granularity) or from an
excessive exposure to a single sector or to several highly correlated sectors (i.e. sector
concentration). In the past, financial regulation and previous research have focused mainly on
the first aspect of concentration risk.2 Therefore, in this paper our focus is on sector
concentration risk, although granularity is also analyzed. Sectors are defined in the following
as business sectors. Sectors defined by geographical regions are not considered in this paper
but our methodology would still be applicable in that case.
The critical role credit risk concentration has played in past bank failures has been
documented in the literature.3 Therefore, the importance of prudently managing sectoral
concentration risk in banks' credit portfolios is generally well recognized. However, existing
literature does not provide much guidance on how to measure sectoral concentration risk.
Consequently, whether particular levels of concentration need to be translated into an
additional capital buffer remains an open question.
This paper contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, in the empirical part, we
measure economic capital in a CreditMetrics-type multi-factor model and evaluate how
important the increase in economic capital is in a sequence of portfolios with increasing sector

concentration. The analysis is based on portfolios which were constructed from German
central credit register data on 2224 banks. The benchmark portfolio reflects the average
business-sector distribution of the banking system as some of the more concentrated portfolios
mirror sector concentrations observed in individual banks. Information on business-sector
concentration of banks is not publicly available, thus central credit registers represent unique
sources of data on sector concentrations in existing banks. Our emphasis on empirically
observable sector concentrations is therefore an important contribution.
We find that economic capital can substantially increase with sector concentration. Its increase
from a credit portfolio representing the average sector distribution of the German banking
system to a portfolio that is concentrated in a single sector can be as high as 50%.
Second, in the theoretical part we evaluate the accuracy of an analytic approximation for
value-at-risk (VaR) and economic capital (EC) which was proposed in Pykhtin (2004) and
offers a tractable closed-form solution for the measurement of concentration risk. EC is
defined as the difference between the VaR and the expected loss of a credit portfolio. We have
applied a simplified version of the Pykhtin model which further reduces the computational
burden by requiring the input parameters exposure size and probability of default (PD) only on
a sector level. Such a methodology could be useful for risk managers and supervisors in search
of robust, fit-for-purpose tools to measure sector concentration in a bank's loan portfolio. The
model allows banks and supervisors to approximate economic capital for loan portfolios
without running computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations.
The methodological framework of the Pykhtin model builds on earlier work by Gordy (2003)
and Wilde (2001) on granularity adjustments in the asymptotic single risk factor (ASRF)
model. Whereas the granularity adjustment deals with an unbalanced exposure distribution
across names, the Pykhtin model offers a treatment for an unbalanced distribution across
(correlated) sectors. EC is given in closed form as the sum of the EC in a single risk factor
model (in which the correlation with the single systematic risk factor depends on the sector)
and a multi-factor adjustment term. We explore the approximation performance both before
the multi-factor adjustment is applied and afterwards which means we consider two
approximation formulae.
We find that for portfolios with highly granular sectors and homogeneous PDs in every sector,
both analytic approximation formulae perform extremely well. Moreover, the multi-factor
adjustment term is relatively small, so that EC in the single risk factor model is already close
to the true EC values obtained by simulations. Our results hold for portfolios with different
levels of sector concentration, a different number of sectors as well as under various weights
of the sector factors (i.e. factor weights sometimes referred to in literature as factor loadings)
and various assumptions about factor correlations. Furthermore, we explore the accuracy of
our model when we relax the assumptions that the portfolio is infinitely granular within each
sector and that all exposures in the same sector have the same PD. We find that the model cp
3
underestimates EC in cases of low granularity, whereas it cp overestimates EC in the presence
of heterogeneity in individual PDs, in particular if creditworthiness increases with exposure
size. The resulting errors in EC from both effects together were less than 10% in the cases
under study. Which of the two effects prevails depends on the specific input parameters. The
results seem to suggest, however, that for representative credit portfolios, the effect of PD
heterogeneity is likely to be stronger than the effect of granularity. This implies that the
analytic approximations err on the conservative side.
To our knowledge there is only one recent empirical paper that considers the impact of sector
concentration risk on economic capital. Burton et al (2005) simulate the distribution of
portfolio credit losses for a number of real US syndicated loan portfolios. They find that,
although name concentration can meaningfully increase EC for smaller portfolios (which are
defined as portfolios with exposures of less than US$10 billion), sector concentration risk is
the main contributor to EC for portfolios of all sizes.
Two other models that measure concentration risk in a tractable model are presented by Garcia
Cespedes et al (2005) and Düllmann (2006). Garcia Cespedes et al (2005) developed an
adjustment to the single risk factor model in the form of a scaling factor to the economic
capital required by the ASRF model. This "diversification factor" is an approximately linear
function of a Hirschmann-Herfindahl index, calculated from the aggregated sector exposures.
This model, however, does not allow for different asset correlations across sectors. Contrary to
the approach in our paper, it cannot distinguish between a portfolio which is highly
concentrated towards a sector with a high correlation with other sectors, and another portfolio
which is equally highly concentrated, but towards a sector which is only weakly correlated
with other sectors. Düllmann (2006) extends Moody's Binomial Expansion Technique by
introducing default infection into the hypothetical portfolio on which the real portfolio is
mapped in order to retain a simple solution for VaR. Unlike the Pykhtin model, the models
developed by Garcia Cespedes et al and Düllmann require the calibration of parameters using
Monte Carlo simulations.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the default-mode version of the
well-established multi-factor CreditMetrics model which serves as a benchmark. Furthermore,
we discuss the simplified version of the Pykhtin model.
The empirical part of our paper comprises Sections 3 and 4. The credit portfolios on which the
empirical analyses are based are described in Section 3. In Section 4 we explore the impact of
sector concentration on EC by gradually increasing sector concentration, starting from a
benchmark portfolio.
In the theoretical part, which comprises Sections 5 to 7, we evaluate the performance of
Pykhtin's (2004) analytic approximation for economic capital by comparison with EC
estimates from Monte Carlo simulations. Section 5 focuses on highly granular portfolios
which are homogeneous on a sector level and, in particular, on the sensitivity of the results to
4
the number of risk factors and correlation figures. Section 6 deals with portfolios characterized
by lower granularity and Section 7 introduces PD heterogeneity on an exposure level. Section
8 summarizes and concludes.
2. Measuring concentration risk in a multi-factor model
2.1. General framework
We assume that every loan in a portfolio can be assigned to a different borrower, so that the
number of exposures or loans equals the number of borrowers. Each borrower i can uniquely
be assigned to a single specific sector. In practice, (large) firms often comprise business lines
from different industry sectors. However, we make this assumption here for practical and
presentational purposes. Let M denote the number of borrowers or loans in the portfolio, Ms
the number of borrowers in sector s, S the number of sectors and wsi
the weight of the
exposure of borrower i in sector s relative to the total portfolio exposure.
The general framework is a multi-factor default-mode Merton-type model.4 The dependence
structure between borrower defaults is driven by sector-dependent systematic risk factors
which are usually correlated. Each risk factor can be uniquely assigned to a different sector, so
that the number of sectors and the number of factors are the same. Credit risk occurs only as a
default event at the end of a one-year horizon, which is consistent with traditional book-value
accounting. The unobservable, normalized asset return Xsi
of the i-th borrower in sector s
triggers the default event if it crosses the default barrier si
. The corresponding unconditional
default probability psi
is defined as
( ).

= 
si si si
p P X
The latent variable Xsi
follows a factor model and can be written as a linear function of an
industry sector risk factor
s
Y and an idiosyncratic risk factor

 and { }

 . The higher the value of the sector-dependent factor
weight rs
, the more sensitive the asset returns of firm i in sector s are to the sector factor. The
disturbance term
si
 follows a standard normal distribution. The assumed weight on the
idiosyncratic risk guarantees that Xsi
has a standard normal distributioni
.
4 See also Gupton et al (1997), Gordy (2000), and Bluhm et al (2003) for more detailed information on this type
of models. The origin of these models can be found in the seminal work by Merton (1974).

The correlations between the systematic sector risk factors Ys
and Yt
are denoted by

are often referred to as factor correlations. The sector factors can be expressed as a linear
combination of independent, standard normally distributed factors Z1

Dependencies between borrowers arise only from their affiliation with the industry sector and
from the correlations between the systematic sector factors. The intra-sector asset correlation

If a firm defaults, the amount of loss depends on the stochastic loss severity

whose
realization is assumed to be known at the time of default. The credit losses of the whole

We assume the same expected loss severity [ ]

In summary, the model needs the following input parameters:
· relative exposure size wsi
and default probability psi
of the i-th borrower in sector s
· the factor correlation matrix and
· the sector-dependent factor weight rs
2.2. The CreditMetrics default-mode model
To obtain the loss distribution, CreditMetrics applies Monte Carlo simulations by generating
asset returns and counting the default events. In each simulation run the portfolio loss is
determined from equation (3). For each exposure, the asset returns for the corresponding
borrower are generated according to equations (1a/b) and compared with the default threshold,

required.

which can be determined given the borrower's default probability. If the realized value of the
asset return falls below the threshold 
si
, the borrower is in default. The portfolio loss of a
simulation run is calculated by adding up the incurred losses from the defaulted borrowers.
The number of simulation runs in our analyses is typically 200,000. Portfolio losses obtained
in each simulation run are then sorted to form the distribution of portfolio losses, from which
EC can be calculated as the difference between the q-quantile of this loss distribution (i.e., the
VaR) and the expected loss. Since it is obtained by simulation, we refer to it in the following
as
sim
EC .
2.3. Analytic EC approximation
In this section, we describe an analytical approximation to the VaR in the framework of a
multi-factor model. We use a simplified version of the model developed by Pykhtin (2004).
The model approximates the VaR in a multi-factor model by adding a "multi-factor"
adjustment term to the VaR in a single factor model in which the correlation of the firm's asset
returns with the single factor depends on the firm's sector. The main advantage of this model is
its tractability, since it does not require Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, we have
simplified the model in such a way that it only requires exposure size and PD on a sector level
instead of an individual borrower level. The factor correlation matrix and the factor weights
are still needed as in the CreditMetrics model.
On the basis of the work by Gouriéroux et al (2000) and Martin and Wilde (2002), we can
approximate the portfolio loss L (see equation 3) by a perturbed loss variable *
L L U

where *
L is a random variable constructed such that the q-quantile of its distribution given in
closed form is close to the q-quantile of the distribution of L. U is defined as the perturbation

t L for a confidence level q in the
asymptotic single risk factor (ASRF) model with infinitely granular sectors. Note that this
single risk factor model differs from the well-known ASRF model in that the asset correlation

is determined by the sector to which the borrower belongs. To avoid confusion, we call this
7
model the "ASRF* model", reserving the term "ASRF model" for the model with uniform
asset correlations.

3. Portfolio composition
3.1. Data set and definition of sectors
Our analyses are based on loan portfolios which reflect characteristics of real bank portfolios
obtained from European credit register data. Our benchmark portfolio represents the overall
sector concentration of the German banking system and was constructed by aggregating the
exposure values of loan portfolios of 2224 German banks in September 2004. The sample
includes branches of foreign banks located in Germany. Credit exposures to foreign
borrowers, however, are excluded. We deem this to be a reasonable approximation of a
portfolio characterized by a degree of diversification which banks can on average achieve
given that it represents the aggregate relative sector exposures of the national banking system.
In principle, we could also have created a more diversified portfolio in the sense of having a
lower VaR. However, such a portfolio would be specific to the credit risk model used and
would not be obtainable for all banks.
All credit institutions in Germany are required by the German Banking Act
(Kreditwesengesetz) to report quarterly exposure amounts of those borrowers whose
indebtedness to them amounts to 1.5 million or more at any time during the three calendar
months preceding the reporting date. In addition, banks report national codes that are
compatible with the NACE classification scheme and indicate the economic activity of the
borrower and his country of residence. Banks are required to aggregate individual borrowers
for regulatory reporting purposes to borrower units which are linked, for example, by equity
holdings and constitute an entity sharing roughly the same risk. The aggregation of exposures
on a business sector level was carried out on the basis of borrower units. If borrowers in the
same unit belong to different sectors, the dominating exposure amount determines the final
sector allocation. Therefore, the credit register includes not only exposures above 1.5 million,
9
but also smaller exposures to individual borrowers belonging to a borrower unit that exceeds
this exposure limit. This characteristic substantially increases its coverage of the credit market.
The industry classification chosen by CreditMetrics is the Global Industry Classification
Standard (GICS), which was jointly launched by Standard & Poor's and Morgan Stanley
Capital International (MSCI) in 1999. The classification scheme was developed to establish a
global standard for categorizing firms into sectors and industries according to their principal
business activities. It comprises 24 industries grouped into 10 broad sectors.7 GICS further
divides these groups into industries and sub-industries. However, the latter more detailed
schemes are not used by vendor models. In the following, we use the broad sector
classification scheme. Because some of the industry groups that form the broad "Industrial"
sector are very heterogeneous, we decided to split this sector into three industry groups:
Capital Goods (including Construction), Commercial Services and Supplies, and
Transportation.8
Credit register datasets, however, use the NACE industry classification system, which is quite
different from the GICS system. In order to use the information from the credit register, we
mapped9 the NACE codes onto the GICS codes. Similar mappings are used by other vendor
models, such as S&P's Portfolio Risk Tracker. We have excluded exposures to the financial
sector (sector G) which comprises exposures to Banks (G1), Diversified Financials (G2),
Insurance Companies (G3) and Real Estate (G4) because of the specificities of this sector.
Exposures to the real estate sector are heavily biased as a large number of them are exposures
to borrowers that are related to the public sector. Since we could not differentiate between
private and public enterprises in the real estate sector, we have excluded this sector from the
following analyses. We have also disregarded exposures to households since there is no
representative stock index for them. This is a typical limitation of models relying on stock
price returns for the estimation of asset correlations. In sum, we distinguish between 11
sectors, which can be considered as broadly representing the Basel II asset classes Corporate
and SMEs.
3.2. Comparison with French, Belgian and Spanish banking
systems
A rough comparison of the relative share of the sector decomposition between the aggregated
German, French, Belgian and Spanish banking systems shows that the numbers are similar.10
The only noticeable difference is the greater share of the Capital Goods sector (33%) and the
7 See Table 12 in Appendix A, which shows the broad sectors and the more detailed industry groups.
8 Unreported simulations have shown that results are not affected by using the more detailed classification scheme.
9 See Table 13 in Appendix A for the mapping.

smaller share of the Commercial Services and Supplies sector in Spain compared to Germany
and Belgium. In general, however, the average sector concentrations are very similar across
the four countries, which suggests that our results are to a large extent transferable.

(*) A breakdown of Industrial sector C into the three categories Capital Goods, Commercial Services and Supplies,
and Transportation is not available for France. The sector shares of the aggregated sector C, however, are quite
similar for all four countries.
3.3. Description of the benchmark portfolio
The sectoral distribution of exposures in the benchmark portfolio, which is shown in Table 1,
represents the sectoral distribution of aggregate exposures in the German banking system. The
degree of concentration in this reference portfolio is purely national and driven by the firms'
sector composition because we do not consider the impact of regional or country factors in our
analysis. It is not uncommon for banks to use a more detailed sector classification scheme. We
consider it more conservative to use a relatively broad sector classification scheme rather than
a very detailed one. In a broad sector classification scheme, a larger proportion of exposures is
attached to one sector. Therefore, correlations between exposures of the same sector (intra-
sector correlations), which are typically greater than the correlations between exposures of
different sectors (inter-sector correlations), will play a larger role.
In order to focus on the impact of sector concentration, we assume an otherwise homogeneous
portfolio by requiring that all other characteristics of the portfolio are uniform across sectors.
We assume a total portfolio volume of 6 million that consists of 6,000 exposures of equal
size which implies a highly granular portfolio in which each exposure represents only 0.017%
of the total portfolio exposure. Every borrower has a probability of default (PD) of 2% and
every exposure is to a different borrower, thus circumventing the need to consider multiple
11
exposure defaults. We set a uniform expected loss severity or loss given default (LGD) of
45%, which is the corresponding supervisory value for a senior unsecured loan in the
Foundation IRB approach of the Basel II framework.11 In the CreditMetrics approach, industry
weights can be assigned to each borrower according to its participation. Here, we assume that
every firm is exposed to only one sector as its main activity. Furthermore, we assume banks do
not reduce exposure to certain sectors by purchasing credit protection.

3.4. Sequence of portfolios with increasing sector concentration
In order to measure the impact on EC of more concentrated portfolios than the benchmark
portfolio, we construct a sequence of six portfolios, each with increased sector concentration
relative to the previous one. To this end, we gradually increase sector concentration in our
benchmark portfolio by using the following algorithm. In each step we remove x exposures
from all sectors and add them to a previously selected sector. This procedure is repeated until
a single-sector portfolio, which is the portfolio with the highest possible concentration, is
obtained. The sector which receives x exposures at every step and also the amount x that is
transferred to this sector are determined in such a way that some of the generated portfolios
reflect a degree of sector concentration that is actually observable in real banks.12
Table 2 shows a sequence of seven portfolios in the order of increasing sector concentration.
The increase in sector concentration is also reflected in the Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index
(HHI),13 given in the last row which is calculated at sector level. Portfolio 1 has been
constructed from the benchmark portfolio by re-allocating one third of each sector exposure to
the sector Capital Goods. The even more concentrated portfolios 2, 3, 4 and 5 have been
created by repeated application of this rule. Portfolios 2 and 5 are similar to portfolios of
11 See BCBS (2004b).
12 This procedure for generating a sequence of portfolios with increasing sector concentration is by no means
unique. Results however are not sensitive to alternative rules of portfolio generation.
13 See Hirschmann (1964).
12
existing banks14 insofar as the sector with the largest exposure size has a similar share of the
total portfolio. Furthermore, the HHI is similar to what is observed in real-world portfolios.
Finally, we created portfolio 6 with the highest degree of concentration as a one-sector
portfolio by shifting all exposures to the Capital Goods sector.

3.5. Intra and inter-sectoral correlations
Given that asset correlations are usually not observable, we have followed market practice in
using sample correlations of stock index returns for their estimation. Table 3 shows the
correlation matrix of the log-returns of those MSCI EMU industry indices which correspond
to the 11 sectors. The sector factor correlations are based on weekly return data covering the
period from November 2003 to November 2004. Sectors that are highly correlated with other
sectors (i.e. sectors that have an average inter-sector correlation of greater than 65%) are
Materials (B), Capital Goods (C1), Transportation (C3) and Consumer Discretionary (D).
Sectors that are moderately correlated with other sectors, i.e. sectors that have an average
inter-sector correlation of between 45% and 65%, are Commercial Services and Supplies (C2),
Consumer Staples (E) and Telecommunication (I). Sectors that are the least correlated with
other sectors, i.e. sectors that have an average inter-sector correlation of less than 45%, are
Energy (A) and Health Care (F). The relative order of these sectors is broadly in line with
results reported in other empirical papers.15 The heterogeneity between Capital Goods,
Commercial Services and Supplies, and Transportation is confirmed by noticeable differences
in correlations. The intra-sector correlations and/or inter-sector correlations between exposures
14 Confidentiality requires those banks with a high sector concentration remain anonymous.
15 See, for example, De Servigny and Renault (2001), FitchRatings (2004) and Moody's (2004). It is difficult to
compare the absolute inter-sector correlation values as different papers report different types of correlations. De
Servigny and Renault (2001) report inter-sector default correlation values, FitchRatings (2004) reports inter-
sector equity correlations while Moody's (2004) provides correlation estimates inferred from co-movements in
ratings and asset correlation estimates. Furthermore, the different papers distinguish between a different number
of sectors.

are obtained by multiplying the sector correlations of Table 3 with the sector-dependent factor
weights, see equation (2).

More difficult than the estimation of sector correlations is the determination of the factor
weights, which determine the intra-sector asset correlations. We do not use the formula
provided in CreditMetrics to compute the factor weights as recent research has suggested that
this formula does not fit the German data very well.16 Instead, we assume a unique factor
weight for all exposures and calibrate the value of the factor weight to match the
corresponding IRB regulatory capital charge. More precisely, we determine a factor weight
rs
=0.50 for all sectors { }
1,...,
s S
 such that the economic capital ECsim
of the benchmark
portfolio equals the IRB capital charge for corporate exposures, assuming a default probability
of 2%, an LGD of 45% and a maturity of one year.
Setting the sector factor weight to 0.5 is slightly more conservative than empirical results for
German companies suggest. The average of all the correlation entries in the factor correlation
matrix is 0.59, which implies by evoking equation (2) an average asset correlation of 0.14
between exposures. Empirical evidence17 has shown that German SMEs typically have an
average asset correlation of 0.09, which suggests 0.39
s
r = . Large firms, however, are
typically more exposed to systematic risk than SMEs and therefore usually have higher asset
correlation values.18
Equation (2) implies that intra-sector asset correlations are thus fixed at 25%. Inter-sector asset
correlations can be calculated by multiplying the factor weights of both sectors by the inter-
sector factor correlation. The lowest correlation between the Energy sector index and the
Information Technology sector index of 10% translates into an inter-sector asset correlation of
2.5%. The highest correlation occurs between the Commercial Services and Supplies and the

Consumer Discretionary sector indices. At 92%, it translates into an inter-sector asset
correlation of 23%.
4. Impact of sector concentration on economic capital
In this section we analyze the impact of increasing sector concentration on economic capital,
which is defined as the difference between the 99.9% percentile of the loss distribution and the
expected loss. The results are given in Table 4. We observe for the corporate portfolios that
economic capital increases from the benchmark portfolio to portfolio 2 by 20%. Economic
capital for the concentrated portfolio 5 increases by a substantial 37% relative to the
benchmark portfolio. These results demonstrate the importance of taking sector concentration
into account when calculating EC.
Typically, the corporate portfolio comprises only a fraction of the total loan portfolio (which
also contains loans to sovereigns, other banks and private retail clients). Although the increase
in sector concentration may have a significant impact on the EC of the corporate credit
portfolio, it may have a much smaller impact in terms of a bank's total credit portfolio. For a
meaningful comparison, we assume that the corporate credit portfolio comprises 30% of the
total credit portfolio and that the banks need to hold capital amounting to 8% of their total
portfolio. By assuming that there are no diversification benefits between corporate exposures
and the bank's other assets, the EC of the total portfolio can be determined as the sum of the
EC for the corporate exposures and the EC for the remaining exposures.

corporate portfolios and for the sequence of total portfolios(*) of a bank (in percent)

Total portfolio 8.0 8.2 8.5 8.7 8.8 8.9 9.2
(*) Total portfolio includes 30% corporate credit and 70% other credit (to retail, sovereign,...)
The results for the total portfolios of the bank are also shown in Table 4. As expected, the
impact of an increase in sector concentration is much less severe when looking at the EC for
the total portfolio. Economic capital for portfolio 5, for example, increases by about 16%
relative to the benchmark portfolio instead of 37% if only the corporate portfolio is taken into
account.
In order to verify how robust our results are to the input parameters, we carried out the
following three robustness checks (RC1 - RC3):
· a lower uniform PD of 0.5% instead of 2% for all sectors (RC1),
· a different factor correlation matrix (See Table 15, Appendix A) representing the
correlation matrix with the highest average annual correlation over the period between
1997 and 2005 (RC2) and
15
· a uniform intra-sector asset correlation of 15% and a uniform inter-sector asset
correlation of 6% (RC3), which are values used by Moody's for the risk analysis of
synthetic CDOs.19
The results of the three robustness checks are summarized in Table 5. Although the absolute
level of EC varies between these robustness checks, the relative increase in EC compared with
the benchmark portfolio is similar to previous results in this section. For Moody's correlation
assumptions in RC3, the increase in EC is stronger than for the other robustness checks. This
can be explained by the larger difference between intra-sector and inter-sector correlations,
which is justified by the higher number of sectors they use, and which leads to a stronger EC
increase when the portfolio becomes more and more concentrated in a single sector. We
conclude that the observed substantial relative increase in EC due to the introduction of sector
concentration is robust against realistic variation of the input parameters. Furthermore, this
increase in EC may be even greater, depending on the underlying dependence structure.

5. Evaluation of the EC approximations for sector-dependent PDs
and high granularity
The purpose of this section is to use the model by Pykhtin to calculate EC and to compare
these EC approximations with the EC obtained from simulations. In this section we assume
first homogeneity within each sector and second a highly granular exposure distribution in
each sector. Because of these two assumptions of our simplified model, the results can be
understood as an upper bound in terms of approximation quality. We further test the accuracy
of the EC approximations by varying the sector distributions, the factor correlations, the factor
weights, the number of factors and the sector PD. Portfolios of coarser granularity and
heterogeneous PDs on an exposure level are studied in Sections 6 and 7.

(*) The relative error is defined as the relative difference between

EC and

The EC figures for the benchmark portfolio in Table 6 show that EC and
MFA
EC provide
extremely accurate proxies for
sim
EC . This result suggests that in the given examples the
calculation of EC may, in practice, be sufficiently accurate for certain risk-management
purposes. The four EC estimates for the more highly concentrated portfolios 1 - 6 indicate that
economic capital increases as expected, but that our results for the approximation performance
of EC and
MFA
EC still hold. According to Table 6, relative errors of
MFA
EC are in a
relatively small range between 0.0% and 1.9%.
Secondly, we check whether our results differ when we vary the underlying correlation
structure. To this end, we calculate in Table 7 the three risk measures for different factor
correlation matrices. More specifically, we assume homogeneous factor correlation matrices in
which the entries (outside the main diagonal) vary between 0 and 1 in increments of 0.2. The
last case, in which all factor correlations are equal to one, corresponds to the case of a single-
factor model.

Table 7 shows
sim
EC and its proxies EC and
MFA
EC for increasing factor correlations. As
expected, economic capital increases with increasing factor correlations, since a higher factor
correlation reduces the diversification potential by shifting probability mass to the tail of the
loss distribution. The highest relative error of
MFA
EC of all factor correlations considered is
2.5% which still reveals a good approximation performance. With increasing factor
correlations the multi-factor model approaches the structure of a one-factor model for which
EC and
MFA
EC coincide. In all cases EC is relatively close to
MFA
EC . Therefore, our
earlier results concerning the good approximation performance of EC and
MFA
EC also hold
under different factor correlation assumptions.
Thirdly, we vary the value of the factor weight r from 0.2 to 0.8. There is a strong increase in
EC with the factor weight but this does not affect the approximation quality, neither of EC
nor of
MFA
EC .
Fourthly, we explore how the results depend on the number of factors. For this purpose we
vary the number of factors from 2 to 16. Figure 2 shows how EC ,
MFA
EC and
sim
EC
depend on the number of sectors and the factor correlation.
MFA
EC is only plotted for 2
sectors because its values are indistinguishable from
sim
EC for 6 and for 16 sectors.

For a given number of sectors, EC increases in Figure 2 with factor correlation as expected. If
the factor correlation approaches one, then EC values coincide, irrespective of the number of
sectors. The reason is that in the limiting case of a factor correlation equal to one, the model
collapses to a single-factor model.
For a factor correlation of 0.6, which is also the average of the entries in the correlation matrix
in Table 3, and also for higher factor correlations, the relative approximation error is below
1% for
MFA
EC and below 2% for EC . Therefore, the previous results showing a good
approximation performance of EC and an even better one for
MFA
EC are found to be robust
with respect to the number of sectors, at least for realistic factor correlations.
Figure 2 also shows that EC and
sim
EC generally decrease when the number of sectors
increases for given asset correlation values. This result can be explained by risk reduction
through diversification across sectors.
Fifthly, we test whether our results for the approximation performance of EC and
MFA
EC
are sensitive to PD heterogeneity on a sector level. For this purpose we employ the scaled
default rates for sectors from Table 8.
19

exposure-weighted expected average default rate of 2% for the benchmark portfolio;

The historical default rates in Table 8 are, on average, higher than the value of 2% which is
used for the PDs in the case of homogeneous PDs for all sectors. In order to isolate the effect
of PD heterogeneity between sectors, we scale the historical default rate, hist

p , for every
sector s as follows,

In this way, we ensure that the weighted average PD of the benchmark portfolio stays at 2%
even in the case of PD heterogeneity across sectors.

EC and the two analytical approximations of EC, using the scaled historical
default rates as PD estimates, are given in Table 9.

For all risk measures the results in Table 9 are relatively close to those in Table 6. The more
concentrated the exposures are in one sector, the smaller the difference to Table 6 becomes.
20
This is explained by the fact that the sector PDs are calibrated to an average value of 2%,
which is also the PD used for Table 6. The approximation quality of EC and
MFA
EC is
similar to Table 6. We conclude that, in qualitative terms, the results obtained for a uniform
PD also hold for heterogeneous sector-dependent PDs.
6. Evaluation of the EC approximations for sector-dependent PDs
and low granularity
Simulation results in the previous section, which reveal a reasonably good approximation
quality for EC and
MFA
EC , were obtained conditional on a uniform PD in every sector and
highly granular portfolios. However, portfolios of small banks, in particular, are less granular.
In the following we explore the impact of lower granularity. From the set of seven portfolios,
only the benchmark portfolio and portfolio 6 are considered as they have the lowest and the
highest sector concentration. The impact of granularity is considered for the following two
cases.
In the first case, characterized by a portfolio of representative granularity, the distribution of
exposure size was selected from a sample of typical small, regional German banks to reflect an
average granularity in terms of the HHI. The purpose is to measure the impact of granularity
for an exposure distribution that is representative for real banks. However, since the exposure
distribution is based on central credit register data, only larger exposures are captured20 in the
underlying data set with the consequence that this exposure distribution is less granular than
what we can expect for real bank portfolios. The HHI of the portfolio, measured on single-
exposure level, is 0.0067 compared with an HHI of 0.001 for the highly granular portfolios
used in the previous section. Descriptive statistics on exposure size of the new portfolio are
shown in Table 16 in Appendix D. Unfortunately, the borrower-specific data on exposure size
contain no sector information.21 The allocation of exposures to sectors was achieved by
randomly drawing exposures from the data set under the constraint that the generated
distribution of exposures across sectors mirrors the sectoral distribution of the benchmark
portfolio. To control for any sampling bias in the results we repeated this random assignment
thereby creating several portfolios. These portfolios have the same sector distribution but vary
in the distribution of individual exposure size in each sector. With these portfolios we verified
the robustness of the results in this and the following section.
20 See section 3.1 for more information on the characteristics of exposures included in the German central credit
register.
21 The reason for this missing information is that we do not use credit register data directly but a matched sample
of credit register data and a second database which provides us also with individual borrower PDs not included
in the credit register but required for the analysis of PD heterogeneity in section 7.
21
In the second case, characterized by low granularity, we consider the highest individual
exposure shares that are admissible under the EU large exposure rules.22 In this way, we obtain
an upper limit for the potential impact of granularity. According to the EU rules, an exposure
is considered "large" if its amount requires 10% or more of regulatory capital. Banks are
generally not allowed to have an exposure that requires at least 25% of regulatory capital.
Furthermore, the sum of all large exposures must not require more than 8 times the regulatory
capital.23
We assume that a bank's regulatory capital is 8% of its total loan volume. For a total portfolio
value of 6,000 currency units, banks are required to hold 480 currency units in capital. Each
large exposure requires a minimum amount of capital of 48 currency units and a maximum
amount of 120 currency units. The total sum of all large exposures must not exceed 3,840
currency units. With these restrictions, the least granular admissible exposure distribution of
our portfolio consists of
· 3840/120 = 32 loans of 120 currency units
· 2160/47 = 45 loan exposures of 47 currency units (just below the large exposure limit
of 48) and
· a remaining single exposure of 45 currency units
The HHI of this portfolio, measured on a single-exposure level, is 0.015. Since this portfolio is
charaterized by relatively coarse granularity, its HHI is considerably higher than for the
portfolio with representative granularity. While keeping the average sector concentration of
the portfolio constant, we increase the granularity of the portfolio to reflect the exposure size
distribution of this least granular portfolio. More details of this portfolio can be found in Table
17, Appendix D.

The
sim
EC value of 9.3% for the low granular benchmark portfolio is 1.3 percentage points
(or 14% in relative terms) higher than for the highly granular benchmark portfolio in Table 9.
This difference appears to be substantial, but we have to consider that the granularity of the
portfolio in Table 10 is very low since it reflects the lowest granularity permissible under
European bank regulation.
sim
EC for the single sector portfolio 6 in Table 10 is higher than
for the benchmark portfolio, which is consistent with earlier reported results.
The
sim
EC value of 8.6% for the benchmark portfolio with representative granularity is
relatively close to the value of 9.3% for the portfolio with low granularity, at least if compared
with
sim
EC of 8.0% for the infinitely granular benchmark portfolio in Table 9. One reason is
that some exposures in the portfolio with representative granularity technically violate the
large exposure rules.24 Therefore, as mentioned before, the portfolio of "representative"
granularity should still be regarded as conservative in terms of granularity.
For the purpose of this analysis, the approximation errors of the EC proxies, *
EC and
MFA
EC ,
are more important than the level of EC. Both EC proxies are based on the assumption of
infinite granularity in each sector, while the
sim
EC calculations take granularity into account.
We find that *
EC and
MFA
EC can substantially underestimate EC by up to 14%, in particular
for portfolios with coarse granularity .
7. Evaluation of EC approximations for heterogeneous sectors
So far we have only considered sector-dependent PDs, which means PD variation on a sector
level, but not on the exposure level. In the following we explore the impact of heterogeneous
PDs inside a sector together with the impact of granularity. For the benchmark portfolio of
representative granularity analyzed in the previous section, we also have individual borrower
PDs which were computed from a logit model based on firms' accounting data. In order to
apply the logit model, borrower information from the central credit register on exposure size
had to be matched with a balance sheet database, also maintained by the Deutsche
Bundesbank.25 Using empirical data on exposure size and PD automatically captures a
potential dependence between these two characteristics.
24 This can be explained either by special BaFin approval or, most likely, by data limitations given that our credit
register data do not contain loans below 1.5 million. The latter implies that their sum is lower than the total
portfolio exposure of the data-providing real bank and, therefore, our relative exposure weights are biased
upwards. In other words, it is well possible that the large exposure limit is breached for our portfolio, although
the limit is still met by the data-providing bank.
25 More details on the database and the logit model that was used to determine the PDs can be found in Krüger et
al. (2005).
23
In order to guarantee comparability with previous results, we apply the same scaling procedure
as in Section 6 to ensure that the exposure-weighted average PD in each sector is the same as
the corresponding scaled default rate given inTable 8. Information on this PD distribution is
given in Table 18, Appendix D.
The portfolio with the lowest granularity admissible under the EU large exposure rules is an
artificially generated portfolio, so that we have no PD information for single exposures.
Therefore, we randomly assign PDs from an empirical aggregate PD distribution based on the
same balance sheet database, but this time aggregated over a sample of banks. The empirical
PD distribution is given in Table 20 and information on the PD distribution of the low granular
portfolio is provided in Table 19, Appendix D.26
The results for PD heterogeneity in every sector are given in Table 11. The reduction of
sim
EC compared to Table 10, which occurs for both portfolios, is due to the PD heterogeneity
on the exposure level. This impact of PD heterogeneity has also been noted by Hanson et al
(2005) and can be explained by the concavity of the dependence of EC on PD.

Since EC and
MFA
EC do not account for PD heterogeneity on the exposure level, these
values stay unchanged from Table 10 while
sim
EC decreases. As a consequence, the
underestimation by using EC and
MFA
EC instead of
sim
EC is reduced relative to Table 10,
or even reversed to an overestimation of EC. This is confirmed by the approximation error in
the last column of Table 11, which is lower when using heterogeneous PDs compared to the
case of sector-dependent PDs in Table 10.
For the single-sector portfolio and the benchmark portfolio with representative granularity, the
approximation errors of the EC proxies are positive, implying that the effect of PD
heterogeneity is stronger than the granularity effect, measured relative to the highly granular
portfolio with homogeneous sector PDs. As a consequence, the EC proxies provide
conservative estimates. Comparing the conservativeness of the single-factor portfolio and the
26 Since a negative correlation between exposure size and PD emerged as a stylized fact in recent empirical
literature (See, for example, Dietsch and Petey (2002) or Lopez (2004)), we also considered the case that the
PDs are perfectly ordered in terms of decreasing exposure size. We found that our results are robust in this case.
24
benchmark portfolio in Table 11, we observe that the degree of overestimation halves from
+8% to +4%. This suggests further robustness checks, in particular for portfolios with a higher
number of sectors.
In summary, the approximation errors for all portfolios considered vary between -6% and
+8%. The results of Table 10 and Table 11 taken together demonstrate that the effect of PD
heterogeneity counterbalances the effect of granularity. In general it is not possible to
determine which of the two opposing effects dominates. For the portfolio with a representative
granularity in Table 11, the effect of granularity is arguably weaker, which suggests that for
portfolios of "average granularity" in real banks, PD heterogeneity would tend to
overcompensate the granularity effect and EC and
MFA
EC would provide conservative
estimates.
Further empirical work is warranted to confirm this indicative result.
Our analysis has shown that PD heterogeneity on the exposure level improves the performance
of the analytic EC approximations relative to the situation of a granular portfolio with (only)
sector-dependent PDs. The reason is that PD heterogeneity reduces the underestimation of EC
that is caused by the granularity of the portfolio. This effect is even stronger if larger
exposures or firms have lower PDs than smaller ones. Furthermore, PD heterogeneity appears
not to affect the relative difference between
MFA
EC and *
EC .
8. Summary and conclusions
The minimum capital requirements for credit risk in the IRB approach of Basel II implicitly
assume that credit portfolios of banks are well diversified across business sectors. Potential
concentration risk in certain business sectors is covered by Pillar 2 of the Basel II Framework,
which comprises the supervisory review process.27 To what extent the regulatory minimum
capital requirements can understate economic capital is an empirical question. In this paper we
provide a tentative answer by using data from the German central credit register. Credit risk is
measured by economic capital in a multi-factor asset value model and determined by Monte
Carlo simulations.
In order to measure the impact of concentration risk on economic capital, we start in the
empirical part with a benchmark portfolio that reflects the aggregate exposure distribution
across sectors of the German banking system. Since the exposure distributions across business
sectors are similar in Belgium, France and Spain, we expect that our main results also hold for
other European countries. Starting with the benchmark portfolio, we have successively
increased sector concentration, considering degrees of sector concentration which are
observable in real banks. The most concentrated portfolio contained exposures only to a single
25
sector. Compared with the benchmark portfolio, economic capital for the concentrated
portfolios can increase by almost 37% and by 50% in the case of a one-sector portfolio. We
have subjected our results to various robustness checks. We find that the increase in economic
capital may be even greater, contingent on the dependence structure. This result clearly
underlines the necessity to take inter-sector dependency into account for the measurement of
credit risk.
Since concentration in business sectors can substantially increase economic capital, a tractable
and robust calculation method for economic capital which avoids the use of computationally
burdensome Monte Carlo simulations is desirable. For this purpose the theoretical part
evaluates the accuracy of a model developed by Pykhtin (2004), which provides an analytical
approximation of economic capital in a multi-factor framework. We have applied a simplified,
more tractable version of the model which requires only sector-aggregates of exposure size,
PD and expected loss severity. The dependence structure is captured by the correlation matrix
of the original multi-factor model. Furthermore, we have evaluated the extent to which EC ,
as the first of two components in the analytic approximation of economic capital, already
provides a reasonable proxy of economic capital. EC refers to the economic capital for a
single-factor model in which the sector-dependent asset correlations are defined by mapping
the richer correlation structure of the multi-factor model. The benchmark for the
approximation quality is always the economic capital figure of the original multi-factor model
which is obtained from MC simulations.
We have shown that the analytic approximation formulae perform very well for portfolios
with highly granular and homogeneous sectors. This result holds for portfolios with different
sector concentrations and for various factor weights and correlation assumptions. Furthermore,
we have found that EC is relatively close to the simulation-based economic capital for most
of the realistic input parameter tupels considered.
Finally, we explore the robustness of our results against the violation of two critical model
assumptions, namely infinite granularity in every sector and sector-dependent PDs. We find
that coarser granularity and PD heterogeneity (on the single exposure level) have
counterbalancing effects on the performance of the analytic approximations for economic
capital. Coarser granularity induces the analytic approximation formulae to have a downward
bias which increases to 14% in extreme cases of portfolios with the lowest granularity
permissible by EU large exposure rules, depending on the sector structure of the portfolio.
Replacing sector-dependent PDs by heterogeneous PDs on the individual exposure level
reduces economic capital, but does not affect the analytic approximations. As a consequence,
the downward bias decreases. The relative error of the analytic approximation, measured
27 See BCBS (2004b), paragraphs 770-777.
26
relative to the simulation-based economic capital figure, lies in a range between ­6% and
+8%, dependent on the exposure distribution across sectors and the number of factors. In
summary, we find that heterogeneity in individual PDs and low granularity partly balance each
other in their impact on the performance of the analytic approximations. Which effect prevails
depends on the specific input parameters. Indicative results suggest that in representative
credit portfolios, PD heterogeneity will at least compensate for the granularity effect, which
suggests that the analytic formulae approximate economic capital reasonably well and err on
the conservative side.
In the cases studied, it is possible to use the analytic economic capital approximations of the
simplified Pykhtin model without sacrificing much accuracy. This is an important result as it
suggests, pending further robustness checks, that supervisors and banks can reasonably well
approximate their economic capital for their credit portfolio by a relatively simple formula and
without running computationally burdensome Monte Carlo simulations.
Further research seems to be warranted, particularly in further advancing Pykhtin's
methodology in a direction which improves its approximation accuracy while staying
parsimonious in terms of data requirements. This could be achieved, for example, by exploring
alternative ways to map the correlation matrix of the multi-factor model into sector-dependent
asset correlations.
