Abstract
Background: Poor water quality, one of the leading causes of diarrhea, is an issue for most developing countries.
Although the health burden of poor-quality water has been studied extensively, there is a paucity of research
regarding the impact of household water treatment (HWT) on children's nutritional status using data from large-
scale surveys. In this research, we study the effect of HWT on the nutritional status of primary-aged children in India
using a secondary data set consisting of 20,315 children between the ages of 6 and 14 (10,523 males and 9,792
females) in 12,839 households from the second wave of the India Human Development Survey (IHDS-II).
Methods: The IHDS-II is a nationally representative, household-based, comprehensive, and face-to-face survey.
Households were selected using stratified random sampling, and a team consisting of one male and one female
interviewer visited each household between November 2011 and October 2012. A knowledgeable member, typically
the male head of household, was interviewed about the socioeconomic condition of the household. An ever-married
woman between the ages of 15 and 49, typically the wife of the male head of household, answered questions related
to education and health. The height and weight of all eligible household members were measured by interviewers.
Correlation between HWT and nutritional status was computed first, and the estimation of a generalized simultaneous
equation model, in which a binary indicator of HWT and other covariates was included, was carried out afterward.
Results: Bivariate analysis shows a negative association between the nutritional status of children and HWT. Additionally,
findings from the generalized simultaneous equation model demonstrate that HWT increases the probability of producing
normal-weighted primary-aged children by 1.7 %, while it decreases the probability of primary-aged children being thin
by 2.5% and being severely thin by 1.7% in India.
Conclusions: This study indicates that HWT has the potential to advance the nutritional status of primary school-aged
children in India.

Background
Water quality is always a critical public-health concern,
especially in developing countries. As a developing
country with the world's fastest growing major economy
[1] as well as the second largest population, poor water
quality has been an ongoing problem [2, 3] in India be-
cause the country lacks water-treatment facilities that can
handle the pollution caused by rapid industrialization and
urbanization [4]; open defecation in many areas without
sanitation infrastructure exacerbates the problem [5]. The
negative effects of water supply are of increasing concern
for people and policy makers with regard to human health
at regional and national levels [6­10]. Therefore, water
treatment is becoming particularly important in improv-
ing the quality of water for cooking or drinking and de-
creasing human-health risks. Considering the challenges
and costs of managing the public water-supply infrastruc-
ture, household water treatment (HWT) has been
regarded as an important and frontline procedure to
achieve safe water supply in India [11].
Malnutrition among children continues to be a critical
public-health issue in developing countries, and India is
no exception. In fact, an estimated 39% of children be-
tween the ages of 0­59 months were stunted, and 29%
were underweight, while 62.5% of the adolescent girls
aged 10­18 were severely or moderately thin between
2013 and 2014 in India [12]. Despite some governmental
policies and measures implemented to improve chil-
dren's nutritional outcomes, children's nutritional status
is still a serious and concerning public-health problem
in India [13, 14].
As pointed out in the literature, drinking unclean
water is a major contributing factor to diarrhea, an ill-
ness that claims numerous children's lives in developing
countries because contaminated water contains patho-
genic bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can cause
gastrointestinal diseases [15]. Moreover, diarrhea in-
creases malabsorption, in turn increasing the likelihood
of malnutrition. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that
water quality in the household has a significant impact
on children's nutritional status in India.
The effect of water quality on children's risk of diar-
rhea in India has been well documented [16­18].
However, studies on the impact of water on children's
nutritional status in India are relatively rare. One study
found that the quality of piped water positively
influences 627 children's weight-for-age and weight-for-
height in Madras, India, but the magnitude and signifi-
cance of this effect vary across age groups [19]. Another
study has demonstrated the benefits of access to piped
water in the household on the nutritional status of
primary-aged children in India [7]. However, these two
studies have a common limitation: they rely on either
quality of piped water [19] or access to piped water [7]
as an indicator of the quality of domestic water supply,
an approach we believe is problematic because, in con-
trast to the situation in developed countries, piped water
is a questionable source of drinking or cooking water in
India. For example, more than half of the pipes in rural
areas in India deliver untreated water [20]. Therefore,
the effect of water quality on children's nutritional status
in India has still not been clearly established.
To better understand the effect of water quality on
children's nutritional status in India, this study uses indi-
vidual-level data from the India Human Development
Survey (IHDS) to investigate whether HWT accom-
plished by boiling, filtering via a purchased filter,
using an AquaGuard, or adding chemicals has signifi-
cant effects on the nutritional status of primary-age
children. Given the sanitation habits and infrastruc-
ture of water treatment in India, we believe that
HWT is a more reasonable indicator of water quality
in India than piped water.
Methods
Data
The IHDS is a nationally representative, multi-topic sur-
vey in India. Thus far, two IHDSs have been conducted:
one in 2004­2005 and the other in 2011­2012. In each
survey wave, a range of information about households
and individuals was collected, including demographic
characteristics, socioeconomic status, anthropometry,
health, etc. This paper used data from the 2011­2012
IHDS (IHDS-II) because it was the most recent round
and the only one to include precise information about
several variables used in our statistical analysis.
The IHDS-II used face-to-face interviews, and house-
holds included in the IHDS-II were chosen using stratified
random sampling. The interviewers asked a knowledgeable
person, typically the male head of household, questions re-
lated to the socioeconomic status of the household (mem-
bers), including questions related to income, employment,
consumption expenditure, and social capital. An ever-
married woman between the ages of 15 and 49 in each
household was interviewed about health, education, family
planning, marriage, and gender relations in the household
and community. Adolescents between the ages of 15 and
18 were interviewed about their education, employment,
marriage, life skills, future planning, friendships, and risky
confidential behaviors. The IHDS-II interviewers also mea-
sured and recorded he weights and heights of all eligible
household members during the interviews.
The IHDS-II surveyed 204,569 individuals and 42,152
households, but there were only 36,554 respondents be-
tween the ages of 6 and 14. Ultimately, only 20,315 from
this sample were used in our study due to a lack of
information on independent or dependent variables in
some observations.

Children's nutritional status
In line with the World Health Organization's (WHO)
child-growth standards, children's nutritional status in
this study was assessed by BMI (body mass index)-for-
age z-scores, which are defined by the number of stand-
ard deviations that a child's BMI is above or below the
median of BMI of the reference population provided by
the WHO/National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).
In other words, a child's BMI-for-age z-score was calculated
using the following formula:
Measured value of BMI-Median value of BMI of the reference group
Standard deviation of BMI of the reference group
After each individual child's z-score was computed,
his or her nutritional status is defined by one of the
following integer values: 1 (obese if z-score > 2), 2
(overweight if 1< z-score  2), 3 (normal if -2  z-
score  1), 4 (thin if -3  z-score < - 2), or 5
(severely thin if z-score < - 3).
Household water treatment (HWT)
To measure if the water of a household in which a
child resides is treated, we created a dichotomous
variable (HWT) based on answers to this question
from the IHDS-II: "During a normal week, do you
ever treat or purify your drinking water by boiling
the water OR by filtering the water with a purchased
filter OR by using AquaGuard OR by adding chemi-
cals?" Answers to this question are classified into four
categories with adjective descriptions: 1 (never), 2
(rarely), 3 (usually), and 4 (always). HMT equals 1 if the
answer is 3 (usually) or 4 (always) and 0 if the answer is 1
(never) or 2 (rarely).
Incidence of diarrhea
It is impossible to achieve precise estimates of the mag-
nitude and significance of the connection between HWT
and children's nutritional status without taking the effect
of diarrhea into consideration in light of the relationship
between water quality and nutritional status described in
the background section. Hence, we created a binary indi-
cator (diarrhea) based on answers to the following ques-
tion from the IHDS-II: "Have you had diarrhea in the
last 30 days?" Answers to this question are classified as 1
(yes) and 0 (no). Diarrhea equals 1 if the answer is yes
and 0 if the answer is no.
Controlled variables
Several variables were controlled for in our statistical
analysis, including number of children in the household,
number of meals in the household per day, hours of TV
watching per day on an average day, gender (1 if male; 0
if female), whether the household income is below the
poverty line (1 if yes; 0 if no), dummies for the highest
education level of adults in the household (less than
elementary school; elementary school; middle school),
dummies for caste categories (Brahmin, Forward/General
(except Brahmin), Other Backward Castes (OBC),
Scheduled Castes (SC), and Scheduled Tribes (ST)),
whether cooking is generally done outdoors (1 if yes; 0 if
no), whether the household has a toilet (1 if yes; 0 if no),
whether hands are washed after defecating (1 if yes; 0 if
no), and 32 state dummies. Table 1 shows the descrip-
tive statistics for all variables in our analysis except the
32 state dummies.
Statistical analysis
Our statistical analysis was carried out in two steps.
First, the association between children's nutritional
status and HWT was examined to give us a rough
idea of the empirical relationship between the two.
Treating HWT as an indicator of water quality and
given the relationship between water quality and nu-
tritional status explained in the background section,
the effect of HWT on children's nutritional status can
be decomposed into direct effect (effect A in Fig. 1)
of HWT and HWT's indirect effect via diarrhea (ef-
fect B × effect C in Fig. 1). In light of this decom-
position and to assess the effects of HWT, we
subsequently estimate a generalized simultaneous
equation model, in which HWT, incidence of diar-
rhea, and all confounding factors described in the
previous subsection were controlled, to assess the
effects of HWT.
The generalized simultaneous equation model consists
of two equations that define the relationship between
HWT and diarrhea on one hand and diarrhea, HWT,
and children's nutritional status (ni
) on the other.
Mathematically, our generalized simultaneous equa-
tion model is specified as follows:
nÃ
i
¼ HWTi
 þ Diarrheai
 þ xi
 þ i
ð1Þ
DiarrheaÃ
i
¼ HWTi
 þ zi
 þ i
ð2Þ
where nÃ
i
is an underlying latent variable representing
an individual child i's propensity to be in a specific status
of nutrition ni
, which takes one of the following integer
values: 1 (obese), 2 (overweight), 3 (normal), 4 (thin),
and 5 (severely thin). DiarrheaÃ
i
is an underlying latent
variable representing an individual child i's propensity to
have diarrhea within the 30-day interval of the interview
date. Diarrheai
equals 1 if DiarrheaÃ
i
> 0, and 0 other-
wise. Variables , , , , and  are the regression param-
eters, and i
and i
are error terms that are assumed to
follow a multivariate logistic distribution. xi
is the vector
of independent variables that includes number of
children in the household, number of meals in the
household per day, hours of TV watching per day on an

the poverty line, the highest education level of adults
in the household, dummies for caste categories, and
32 state dummies. zi
is the vector of independent
variables that includes whether the household in-
come is below the poverty line, dummies for caste
categories, whether cooking is generally done out-
doors, whether the household has a toilet, and
whether hands are washed after defecating. All
parameters of interest, including , , ,  and , are
estimated jointly using maximum likelihood. Given
that there are several binary regressors in the model,
the marginal effect of HWT on nutritional status
(ni
), the marginal effect of diarrhea on nutritional
status (ni
), and the marginal effect of HWT on diar-
rhea were evaluated at a representative value of in-
dependent variables and used to estimate effect A,
effect B, and effect C, respectively (see Fig. 1). Table 1
shows the summary statistics of all variables in our gener-
alized simultaneous equation model.

Results
Bivariate analysis
Table 2 shows the distribution of our sample's nutri-
tional status by HWT. A higher percentage of children
with access to treated drinking water are classified as
"obese" and "overweight," while a lower percentage of
the same group of children are classified as "thin" and
"severely thin" (compared to children who do not have
access to treated water for drinking). Additionally, a
lower percentage of children with access to treated water
have a "normal" nutritional status (relative to those with-
out such access). Overall, Table 2 shows there is a
negative association between HWT and nutritional sta-
tus among primary-aged children in India. However,

although serving as a good starting point for our ana-
lysis, the results in Table 2 do not necessarily imply
causality between these two variables, as no confounding
factors have been taken into account.
Generalized simultaneous equation model
The results of generalized simultaneous equation model
are reported in Table 3. Tables 4, 5, and 6 report the es-
timates of effect A, effect B, and effect C, respectively,
defined in Fig. 1, which is developed based on the rela-
tionship between water quality and nutritional status
discussed in the background section. As Table 4 shows,
HWT increases the probability of having a normal
weight, being overweight, and being obese by 1.7%, 1.3%,
and 1.1%, respectively. However, it decreases the prob-
ability of being thin by 2.5% and severely thin by 1.7%.
Table 5 shows that having diarrhea decreases the prob-
ability of having a normal weight, being overweight, and
being obese by 1.9%, 0.8%, and 0.6%, respectively.
However, it increases the probability of being thin by 1.9%
and severely thin by 1.4%, which is consistent with the fact
that diarrhea increases malabsorption, which was men-
tioned in the background section. Table 6 shows that the
impact of HWT on diarrhea is very small and statistically
insignificant; hence, the indirect effect of HWT on nutri-
tional status, which essentially mirrors what is reported in
Tables 5 and 6, is almost negligible when calculating the
total effect of HWT on nutritional status. As a result, the
overall impact of HWT on children's nutritional status
(the sum of direct and indirect effects of HWT) reported
in Table 7 is identical to those reported (effect A in Fig. 1)
in Table 4. Based on the estimates reported in Table 7,
children who consume water treated by boiling, filtering
with a purchased filter, using AquaGuard, or adding
chemicals in the household were less likely to have poor
nutritional status than other children in India.
Discussion
Main findings of this study
First, based on the average of HWT reported in Table 1,
only approximately 17.8% of children in our sample are
reported to have access to safe drinking water, which is
low. Given that it has been reported that the use of
HWT is related to household characteristics, such as
education level and income level [21­24], and our sam-
ple consists of a high percentage of poor households
with less-educated heads of household, this low percent-
age is not a surprise.
Second, based on the results from our generalized sim-
ultaneous equation model, it was found that HWT
would decrease children's chances of being "thin" and
"severely thin," while it would increase, although the
effect is smaller, their chances of being "normally
weighted," "obese," or "overweight" in India. Therefore,
this study revealed that, in general, HWT increases chil-
dren's nutrition level in India. Our results make sense
from a chemistry and epidemiology point of view.
According to studies in these two fields, HWT is effect-
ive in terms of controlling volatile disinfection by-
products, which are responsible for unsafe drinking
water [25]. Additionally, treated drinking water by boil-
ing in the household had a low risk of containing ther-
motolerant coliform compared to untreated water [26],

and HWT systems constructed by inexpensive local ma-
terials consistently produce high-quality drinking water
by removing waterborne bacteria [27]. Moreover, HWT
filters are effective in the removal of turbidity and some
contaminants [28].
As mentioned in the background section, literature of
the relationship between water quality and nutritional
status of children in India have a common limitation:
they rely on either quality of piped water [19] or access
to piped water [7] as a measure of water quality, but
piped water is a questionable source of drinking or cook-
ing water in India. Different from the literature, this
study uses a more appropriate measure of water quality,
which is HWT, to estimate the effect water quality on
nutritional status of children in India, and hence a more
precise estimate is anticipated to be generated.
Limitations
This study has certain limitations. First, although we
considered as many control variables as possible, some
important factors, such as residential area, were not con-
trolled for because they are presently restricted by the
IHDS-II for public use. Furthermore, this research ex-
plored the effect of general HWT on children's nutri-
tional status and did not include modes of HWT in the
analysis due to data limitations. An analysis that takes
the modes of HWT into consideration will help us
understand the difference in the efficiency of HWT with
respect to improving children's health in India once the
data are available in the future.
Conclusions
India still lags behind the United Nations Millennium
Development Goals for childhood diarrhea and child
malnutrition [29]. This study indicates that HWT de-
creases the probability of malnutrition for children in
India. The findings in this study have important implica-
tions for the people and government of India. First,
while HWT is effective, the Indian government should
invest more heavily in improving access to potable water,
such as scaling up well-structured, continuous piped
water sources and improving access to HWT for families
currently lacking reasonable-quality water supply. This is
particularly important among poor households and poor
regions/states that are disproportionately burdened by
child malnutrition, morbidity, and mortality [30]. Fur-
thermore, programs and policies are needed to commu-
nicate the importance of treating drinking water in order
to prevent waterborne illness and associated diarrhea
and malnutrition [29].
