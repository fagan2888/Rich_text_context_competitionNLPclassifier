In sociology, most interviews (and the in-depth, undirected
interview in particular) begin with a period of awkwardness, as
investigators well know. Beginners would like to avoid or
shorten this period; they do not realize how fruitful it is.
--Henri Lefebvre, Critique of Everyday Life (2014, p. 1335)
In our interviews with recently arrested street sex workers, I
(first author) remember the early morning chill arriving at
the jail; the slow process of moving through layers of secu-
rity and the physical barriers of gates opening and closing;
yelling "Hit!" to the correctional officers inside the plate
glass to activate the door; waiting outside the cells for women
to come out while my colleague (second author) entered the
"pod" to meet with them and offer the opportunity to partici-
pate in our research. Then we would move to a separate,
semiprivate room, mostly soundproof but with windows all
around, where we were seen but not heard by the officers in
the control station. There we went through the lengthy pro-
cess of informed consent that paved the way for the inter-
views at the core of our research design.
I also remember the awkward first moments of the inter-
view, as I attuned myself to the emotional timbre of the com-
plex individual in front of me and adjusted once again to the
cold imposition of the jail setting and to the compelling
narratives that emerged in response to the questions I posed,
sometimes deeply personal in the depth of their detail. These
fumbling moments were not considered "research" in our
formal research design, but they were fundamental to the
process of establishing a space where these narratives could
unfold, in spite of those cold institutional surroundings.
We began conducting these ethnographic interviews in
2009, as part of a mixed-methods study of substance misuse
and street sex workers in the Detroit area. These interviews
were not intended to be therapeutic; they were neither a form
of treatment nor a tool of diagnosis, but a method of schol-
arly inquiry. However, in carrying out such interviews, we
found that participants sometimes claimed a therapeutic ben-
efit from the interview, even though none was promised or
intended. The question was, simply, "why?"
As we became immersed in the study of people in recovery
and their social contexts, we also grew increasingly interested

Parallel Paradoxes and Useful
Uselessness: Notes on the Confluence
of Ethnography, Mindfulness, and
Recovery
Paul Draus1, Juliette Roddy1, and Kanzoni Asabigi2
Abstract
This article explores potentially productive parallels between ethnographic interviewing, mindfulness-based practices,
and recovery processes. First, we consider ethnographic interviews as dialogic and affective encounters that reflect and
complement the recovery process, paradoxically enhancing agency by illuminating one's lack of control. For individuals in
recovery from substance abuse and associated trauma, the ethnographic interview may provide an opportunity to examine
past events and gain insight into factors that contributed to risky situations and behaviors. We propose that the dialogic space
created by the ethnographic interview resembles the moment-to-moment awareness cultivated by mindfulness practices
and may have individual-level benefits for similar reasons. We briefly explore the relevance of recent research on epigenetic
and neural plasticity. Finally, the potential for greater awareness of these mindfulness mechanisms to enhance ethnographic
interviews is discussed.

(on an intellectual level) and engaged (on an interpersonal
level) in the process of recovery itself. In the course of our
interviews, it became apparent that our act of listening was
itself important not only for research purposes (the data
gleaned from it) but also for the embodied process of recovery
of which we were now effectively a part.
We began to consider the ways in which ethnographic
interviews themselves might contribute to recovery, even
if--perhaps even because--that effect was unintended. In
the pages that follow, we propose that these interviews func-
tioned as dialogic encounters, which may actually enhance
processes of recovery, in part because they promote a non-
goal-directed state of mindfulness. We support this claim
with examples from our research. We then consider the par-
allel paradoxes inherent in sociology, recovery and mindful-
ness as they relate to expanding agency by surrendering
control. Finally, we conclude with a reflective discussion on
the positive potential of this link between mindfulness, eth-
nography, and recovery, and the importance of being truly
present in ethnographic research.
Ethnographic Interviews as Dialogic
and Affective Encounters
As noted above, ethnographic interviews are very different
from interviews used as therapy. Ethnographers do not seek
to diagnose or assist people with life management skills
through interviewing them, and our informed consent explic-
itly states that we are not a part of a treatment program and
that participation in our interviews carries no implications for
their treatment or their legal status. We state that this research
could potentially inform treatment or prevention programs in
the future. In this way, our interviews might have a benefit for
others, even if there is no actual benefit to the individual at the
time. While we believe in this long-term goal, and our publi-
cation of research attests to this pursuit, it leaves out some-
thing important: the experience of the interview itself.
Classical conceptions of ethnography tended to view the
researcher as an objective recorder and analyst of informa-
tion, if not invisible then at the very least detached (Van
Maanen, 1988). According to Fuchs (2009), ethnographic
research differs from other social science research methods
primarily in that it shrinks the distance between observer and
observed, allowing for the greater detection of what he calls
"agency effects" as well as a deeper understanding of the
individual, or Verstehen (p. 104).
As with other forms of ethnographic research, the goal of
such interviews is to gain insight into the individual's life-
world (Schutz, 1967).According to Schutz (1967), "all genu-
ine understanding of the other person must start out from acts
of explication performed by the observer on his own lived
experience" (p. 113). In other words, the interview offers a
view into the participant's interior world, even as that world
is in the process of evolving.
Archer's (2003) concept of the internal conversation
offers another way of thinking about the ethnographic inter-
view. According to Archer, the internal conversation is a
mediator between structure and agency, as individuals
actively reflect upon their social situation and contemplate
their choices and goals. While ethnographic interviews are
clearly not internal conversations, they are not truly two-
sided conversations either. As defined by Spradley (1979),
an ethnographic interview is a particular type of speech
event, similar to a friendly conversation but with a number of
differences: turn-taking is less balanced, the conversation
may include substantial repetition, and the ethnographer is
more likely to express ignorance and interest and to encour-
age expansion rather than abbreviation. Interviews thus cre-
ate a space in which researchers can gain information through
an individual's self-presentation. At the same time, those
individuals may share their daily life and experience and also
reflect upon it, engaging in a kind of externalized version of
an internal conversation, allowing the ethnographer to listen
in on a conversation, or dialogue, between these various past,
present, and potential selves.
As proposed by Frank (2010), the truly dialogic interview
acknowledges the possibility that both parties will change as
a result of the interaction. A dialogic approach implies that
the ethnographic interview is about more than the informa-
tion--cultural, psychological, or otherwise--that is elicited
from, or about, the participant. It is also fundamentally about
connection. The "affective turn" in the humanities and social
sciences makes a similar point concerning the two-way flow
of effects and affects resulting from human interactions.
According to Hardt (2007),
affects . . . offer a complex view of causality because the affects
belong simultaneously to both sides of the causal relationship.
They illuminate . . . both our power to affect the world around us
and our power to be affected by it, along with the relationship
between these two powers. (p. ix)
In the case of the ethnographic interview, the affective
encounter that occurs between the ethnographer and the
respondent is not only a speech event but a physical and emo-
tional event as well. According to Parr (2010), "affect is the
transitional product of an encounter, specific in its ethical
and lived dimensions and yet it is also as indefinite as the
experience of a sunset, transformation, or ghost" (p. 11). If
an interview is truly dialogical, then it is an encounter in
which both participate fully, even if one person is primarily
listening and the other is doing most of the talking.
Setting the Stage: Opening Narrative
and Reflexive Space
The beginning of a qualitative interview serves to foster a safe
space of interaction between the interviewer and the individ-
ual participant. Our own interview protocols typically begin
Draus et al. 3
the same way, regardless of the topic that we are investigat-
ing: "The purpose of this interview is for me to learn from
you and your experiences." In our interviews with women
who had recently engaged in street sex work in Detroit, we
always began with an open-ended, stage-setting question,
often using spatial language, asking participants to tell what
kind of place they are in, and how they got there. Here is one
example of an opening statement to a participant:
Okay, I would like to begin just by asking you to tell me a little
bit about your life as it is today, and where you are in your life
right now. I mean I know where you are physically. But, tell me
a little bit about your life and how you got here.
This question invited the individual to actively narrate her
experience. For example, a transgender man who had
recently been arrested while engaging in street sex work
responded this way:
R: Okay. I basically had like a good upbringing. Nothing too
spectacular. Um, good home, whatever. There is nothing like
really, really different. But basically, the whole reason I started
like going out and getting out on the street or whatever, is
because it was an easy way to make money and the whole how I
started--honestly how I started to like smoke the weed, a little
coke was basically peer pressure. I started smoking weed with
my best friend in the 'hood, then one day, uh, I started dressing
in drag, and from that, from there on, I noticed how much
attention I get, how much money I got . . . I was introduced to
cocaine, the powder, the powder to snort, toot-toot. And um, the
girls say it keeps you up, so from then on, it took from one girl
giving me a bump to me buying my own 20 sack of powder and
it just, it progressively got worse and . . . . that is how I ended up
here.
Another example, from an interview with a woman at a later
stage in the program, invites a very different accounting or
narration.
R: Um now? I am ah, I am a student. I am in the Culinary
Academy. Um, I have a 16-month-old daughter--I am in my--I
have been in a long-term relationship--well to me long term is
3 years, so . . . . But I been going, I been in a relationship going
on 3 years, um . . . Basically I'm, now I'm pretty boring. I-I
generally go to school, come home, spend time with, pick my
daughter up from day care. Spend time with her and then get up
the next day and do the same thing over again. On the weekends
I really kinda--stay home or I go visit--friends. You know I
don't have any family that lives in the Detroit area, so I spend
long conversations on the phone on the weekends with my
sister--we have coffee--on Sunday morning and talk on the
phone for like 2 hr. You know, but other than that, I'm really
boring now.
In both of these cases, the individual is using narrative not
only to relate information but also to make sense of it. The
second of the two responses above is an act of framing and
interpretation as much as it is a recording of facts and details
concerning that individual's social context. We see evidence
of both "positionalities" and "interior worlds" (Maynes,
Pierce, & Laslett, 2008) in her descriptions of daily life and
in the assertion that "I'm really boring now." This statement
contains an implicit comparison, and the follow-up question
asks the participant to explicitly compare past phases of her
life with the one she is in now:
IR: Yeah. And how would you compare that--in this sort of
phase in your life with other phases in your life, other time
periods in your life--or other positions you've been in?
R: I never thought that I would be where I am today--I NEVER
thought that I would EVER get my act together. I always thought
that I would just be on the streets for the rest of my life; I used to
think that I actually like the way I lived--I actually like getting
high, I actually like being on the streets; I used to think that.
Here we see a reflexive dimension opening up within the
interview, which now becomes not only a conversation
between an "ethnographer" and an "informant" but also a
conversation with previous selves. The narrative that results
is therefore a complex negotiation, being both a product and
a process, a summation, and an aspiration.
According to Gold (2007), narrative plays a crucial role in
the recovery process because it allows people to transform
past trauma into a useful tool for healing not only them-
selves, but others as well. Writing about recovery from psy-
chosis, Gold (2007) states that it "is an arduous biological,
psychological, social and spiritual journey--a gradual pro-
cess of restoring connections and health" (p. 1272). Going
even further, Frank (2010) argues that narratives are them-
selves agents, ushering in new possibilities of thought and
action. Neurological research suggests that hearing another's
story, and having one's own story actually be heard, pro-
duces neural coupling that is both intimate and automatic
(Stephens, Silbert, & Hasson, 2010). In other words, a bio-
logical response happens on both sides. As researchers
engaged in active listening, we have experienced this phe-
nomenon within some very memorable interviews. What we
did not realize at the time was how this might also contribute
to both a state of mindfulness and the recovery process.
Mindfulness and Recovery
Grabovac, Lau, and Willett (2011) use a Buddhist psycho-
logical model to break down the process of moment-by-
moment awareness that all human beings experience. First,
they state that an individual can be aware of only one object
at a time. Second, with awareness of any object comes a posi-
tive, negative, or neutral feeling tone. Third, reactions of
attachment and aversion arise in response to this feeling state,
not to the object itself. Fourth, not being aware of attachment
and aversion can make this process habitual, which may lead
4 SAGE Open
to mental proliferation. Finally, habitual attachment and aver-
sion and the resulting mental proliferation lead to suffering,
including possible clinical symptoms (see Figure 1).
In contrast, they define mindfulness as "the moment-by-
moment observing of the three characteristics (imperma-
nence, suffering and not-self) of the meditation object"
(Grabovac, Lau, & Willett, 2011, p. 4). The model described
by Grabovac et al. closely parallels the cycle described in a
substance misuse recovery manual by Tighe (1999), who
provides a cartoon (Figure 2) showing an individual respond-
ing to an event emotionally, then reacting to the emotion (one
step removed from the event).
Similarly, Lewis (2011) argues that addiction is a phenome-
non that does not fall clearly into the camps of either individual
"choice" or biological "disease," but instead consists of "a
sequence of transitory states underlying impulse, reflection and
emotions that include shame and remorse" (p. 154).
Recovery from addiction is closely tied to the recognition
of this cycle. Bien (2009) states that awareness of the cycle
may itself aid in the process of recovery:
Urges arise or fail to arise, and we are not in control of this
process. Since we are not in control, we deserve neither credit
nor blame for their occurrence or lack. What matters is how we
handle the urge to relapse when it does arise. Though it may
seem counterintuitive, mindfulness suggests that we are better
off being aware of the relapse thoughts and feelings when they
arise instead of trying to deny their arising. (p. 294)
He continues, "The most important psychotherapeutic impli-
cation of mindfulness may lie not so much in techniques to

Draus et al. 5
teach clients--though these may be valuable--but in the
capacity of the therapist to be truly present" (p. 296). As an
example of this phenomenon, Santorelli (1999) describes a
group meeting in a stress reduction clinic, stating that as indi-
viduals share their stories of suffering, "There is a spontane-
ous arising of mindfulness--of awareness cultivated by our
willingness to hear one another, to sit together without judg-
ment, without giving advice, without reaching for easy
answers or invoking shallow affirmations" (pp. 12-13).
Regardless of how the state of mindfulness is achieved,
research suggests that it may reduce stress related to events and
have therapeutic effects. Because our ethnographic research
focuses on individuals with histories of substance misuse and
involvement in the criminal justice system, we are especially
interested in research relating to mindfulness interventions in
substance misuse treatment or recovery programs and correc-
tional settings. Himelstein (2011) reviewed empirical research
regarding the effects of mindfulness-based programs on cor-
rectional populations and found that they contribute to enhance-
ment of psychological well-being and decreases in substance
use and recidivism. Howell and Buro (2011) found evidence
that the cultivation of mindfulness results in enhanced execu-
tive processes, better emotion regulation, and less cognitive
rumination and behavioral avoidance.
The following extended passage, from an interview with
a woman in recovery, provides an astute breakdown of what
she learned in her treatment program:
IR: So were there skills that you learned, particular things you
learned in terms of about yourself-in analyzing yourself or-or in
terms of structuring your-your time--skills like that or is it more
the sort of the relationships that you had with people there?
R: Just that I could be better, you know what I'm saying? That I
was worth more. You know I-I am not a-I've never-I'm--I don't
know how to explain it um--I don't know if you call it like skills
that I learned; I just learned to believe in myself. You know what
I'm saying--that life is better than what--being on the streets or
getting high--life is, life is good if you just do the right thing,
you know what I'm saying? I-I don't always make the right
decisions; even now--I still make stupid decisions, but who
doesn't, you know what I'm saying--not everybody does
everything right.
IR: Can you, can you think of a time or-or ah moment when
that--whenyoubecameawareofthat?Thatyouhadlearnedthat--
R: When my therapist broke down my arrogance. Because I'm
very arrogant and I'm very hard headed--I'm very stubborn and
I want to do things my way; when she finally got through to
me--when she had me write this paper on arrogance, um, I
looked at and I said--are you serious because I sounded so
ridiculous on the paper. And that's when I finally realized that I
can't do things the way I want to do things because the way I do
things, I always end up doing something that I shouldn't or that
at the time sounds great or--but I don't think the whole way
through. I-I live for the now.
IR: Yeah.
R: And that's how I used to be, you know what I'm saying; I can
actually--sit down now and think about things and what the end
outcome will be.
IR: Yeah.
R: Whereas before, I just acted.
Figure 2. The cycle of event, response, emotion, and behavior.

6 SAGE Open
IR: Yeah.
R: I was a reaction-type person. You know?
Here, we see an illustration of the concept of mindfulness
employed in a therapeutic way--stepping back from the
moment, not simply reacting but paying attention to one's
own reactions and thinking about them. She refers to herself
as "living for the now" and as a "reaction-type person."
These statements are actually a contradiction from a mind-
fulness perspective, because a person who simply reacts usu-
ally does so on the basis of past experiences. However, the
therapist's exercise in having the woman narrate her own life
allowed her to see the reaction process for what it was; in that
sense, it allowed her to be truly in the moment, aware of what
was happening to her, but also aware of how she was
responding.
In our earliest interviews, a similar moment often occurred
when participants were asked to reflect on the daily routines
that characterized life in the street. In these two passages,
two different women describe how this process made them
feel:
Passage 1:
IR: All right. So we talked a little bit about what your life was
like then before you came in here. You know, not just this last
time but the time before that. The last thing I want to ask you
about is when you think about this life that you've been living
here and where do you see for yourself going forward into the
future.
R: Wow. What I think about this life that I've always lived in is
completely ridiculous. It was exhausting, it's tiring. Not only
that but it's also the sickness from not always being, not always,
you know, not always having my dope when I need it, you know.
I would eventually get it, but it might take some time before I
could get it and being sick, and it was just hard. So I'm just tired
of it.
Passage 2:
IR: Okay, so based on what we just talked about, what are you
thinking about now in terms of just like you've already talked
about this, but--
R: That it's a waste. I want more. I want something that stands
out and goes, "Wow."
IR: So what do you think you would like to do? I mean what do
you see for yourself?
R: My goal is to stay abstinent . . . abstinent of all drugs. Get a
higher education. To stay in treatment, because I got to go for 15
months. I got to go to a 15-month program. So they're going to
help me with my levels. You know, each level I get to, the stage.
Because I got a brilliant mind. When my mind starts opening up,
I'm really smart. I can really think believe or not. When I get on
that dope, I'm useless.
IR: Now, you said though that--so in living this life you were
living here, you didn't have much time to think. You didn't
spend much time thinking about your life?
R: No. I couldn't even find my brain cells.
Here, we see that the ethnographic interview may reflect or
enhance the moment-by-moment awareness that also charac-
terizes mindfulness. These statements also reflect the under-
standings of the recovery process articulated to us by
numerous individuals that we met in the course of our
research. For example, a man at a recovery picnic on Belle
Isle in Detroit told us that recovery involved a process of
intentional "mind-mapping." While recovery emphasizes an
acknowledgment of powerlessness, as discussed above, it
also embraces the possibility, even the necessity, of delibera-
tive, transformative change. The paradox of recovery is that
these are closely linked.
Parallel Paradoxes: Recovery,
Sociology, and Mindfulness
The paradox of agency through powerlessness, which lies at
the heart of the recovery experience, is expressed in a variety
of ways, perhaps most memorably in the Serenity Prayer:
God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot
change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to
know the difference. Steps 1, 2, and 3 of the 12-step method,
articulated by Alcoholics Anonymous and intended to
address addiction and other dysfunctional behaviors, also
emphasize the relinquishing of power.
Paradoxes are also central to sociological practice and lie
at the heart of Mills' (1959) classic formulation of the socio-
logical imagination. Mills wrote that the sociological imagi-
nation enables one to grasp the dynamic relationship between
history and biography, between private troubles and public
issues--between the things we can change as individuals, the
things that must be addressed through society, and the things
that we may not be able to change at all. For sociologists, this
awareness of the structure and power of society is not para-
lyzing, but transformative. It frees us to focus on those key
points where change is possible and to recognize that agency
is real, if always shaped and limited by context.
In her exploration of the potential for a Buddhist sociol-
ogy, Schipper (2012) examines the parallels between the
Four Noble Truths of Buddhism (there is suffering, there is a
cause of suffering, suffering can ease, and there is a path that
leads to the cessation of suffering) and the dual orientations
of sociology toward understanding social problems and
engaging in social change. She relates the practice of mind-
fulness, one of the paths out of suffering, directly to the con-
cept of the sociological imagination:
Draus et al. 7
If mindful practices help us to not only form powerful critiques
of social institutions and cultural practices, but also help us
uncover many of the subtle illusions that shape our lives, might
we consider such practices as extensions of the sociological
imagination? (Schipper, 2012, p. 214)
Lee (2015) likewise issues a call for "sociological mindful-
ness," which "highlights macro-level interconnectedness and
identifies appropriate sites for positive social change, while
enhancing motivation to work for this change" (p. 281).
For those who have been systematically or categorically
oppressed or excluded, this awareness may free them from a
sense of shame or worthlessness that may result from the
internalization of a structural position. For some people, the
dawning of sociological imagination may be a revelation
comparable to the moment of clarity described by addicts
who have hit "rock bottom." One is paradoxically empow-
ered by the comprehension of how much of social life lies
outside the sphere of control of the individual. This realiza-
tion frees the individual from self-blame for what has
occurred in the past and allows the individual to act more
freely in the present. In his classic work, Zen Mind, Beginner's
Mind, Suzuki (1970) writes, "To live in the realm of Buddha
nature means to die as a small being, moment after moment.
When we lose our balance we die, but at the same time we
also develop ourselves, we grow" (pp. 31-32). Recovery-
oriented books contain many passages, such as the follow-
ing, that attest to the spiritual dimensions of this process or
journey and invite parallels to mindfulness:
Being present and in the moment, and feeling alive, aware, and
connected are feelings we hear about most often when members
are sharing about their experiences with prayer and meditation.
Most of us don't feel that profound sense of unity in every
waking moment, but just knowing that we can feel it sometimes
brings a sense of security. (Narcotics Anonymous, 2012, p. 74)
Shapiro (2013) draws a direct connection between the 12
steps of recovery and the Buddhist-inspired practice of mind-
fulness. He asserts that the fundamental addiction that under-
lies not only substance misuse but also all of modern life is
that of control, or rather the longing for control, as control
itself is impossible. Shapiro (2013) writes,
The fundamental and paradoxical premise of Twelve Step
recovery as I experience it is this: The more clearly you realize
your lack of control, the more powerless you discover yourself
to be. The more powerless you discover yourself to be, the more
natural it is for you to be surrendered to God. The more
surrendered to God you become, the less you struggle against
the natural flow of life. The less you struggle against the natural
flow of life, the freer you become. Radical powerlessness is
radical freedom, liberating you from the need to control the
ocean of life and freeing you to learn how to navigate it. (p. 3)
People who feel little control over their lives may be at higher
risk of substance misuse (Anderson, 2008). After all, we can
achieve a sense of agency in terms of the things we put into
our bodies, even if nothing else is within our control.
Although many people conceive of addiction as a loss of
control, for those in recovery addiction is portrayed as an
addiction to control. The gift of powerlessness in this context
is to reveal how little in our lives we actually do control,
which may then free us (as Shapiro puts it) to navigate: not
escape (for there is no escape but death), not control (because
control is an illusion), but simply recognize what is before
us, and respond (not react) appropriately.
Jon Kabat-Zinn has described mindfulness as "paying
attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present
moment, and nonjudgmentally" (Kabat-Zinn, 1994, p. 4). As
the objectification and corresponding alienation of the patient
has become the focus of forceful critiques of biomedicine,
the notion of the mindful practitioner has emerged as a poten-
tial antidote or corrective. By being truly present with the
patient, the mindful physician (or nurse, or therapist)
acknowledges the importance of the conversation itself or
the encounter itself, apart from the information that it may
impart in either direction. This simple acknowledgment of
the other's story, with all its attached suffering and confu-
sion, in turn may be a component of healing. Because mind-
fulness promotes a clear awareness of one's inner and outer
worlds, including thoughts, sensations, emotions, actions, or
surroundings as they exist at any given moment, it helps to
reveal what is occurring in a conversation, before conceptual
and emotional classification has taken place.
As Lee (2015) has noted, mindfulness has recently
become something of a boom industry, and the scholarly lit-
erature on mindfulness has also grown tremendously.
However, issues remain with the scientific study of mindful-
ness. As Chiesa and Malinowski (2011) have pointed out,
the word "mindfulness" is frequently used as a construct, a
mental state, or as a number of practices designed to achieve this
state, raising concerns as to what current studies are actually
measuring when they claim they are measuring mindfulness . . . .
(p. 405)
In some cases, the focus is on mindfulness as beneficial in
the patient's healing process (Ludwig & Kabat-Zinn, 2008)
or the potential of mindful communication to reduce physi-
cian burnout (Krasner et al., 2009). According to Smalley
(2010),
Science is a methodology that uses third-person observation, by
which we mean that it is an objective process that yields
comparable knowledge no matter who does it. In contrast,
mindfulness is a first-person, or subjective, methodology, the
observation of which is quite challenging. (p. 3)
This distinction seems to implicitly invite the use of qualita-
tive methods for studying mindfulness practices and states.
Finally, Mercer (2013) has observed that the public and
policy discourse on addiction tends to be dominated by
8 SAGE Open
deontological or rules-based positions, which emphasize
abstinence from drug use above all else, or utilitarian, harm-
reduction perspectives, which seek to minimize risk, both to
the individual and society. He argues that recovery does not
fit into either position because it represents a form of
Aristotelian virtue ethics, focused on the ongoing develop-
ment of character and promotion of human flourishing, goals
that are not as easily measured and that therefore do not lend
themselves to quantitatively based research models. Though
not designed to do so, our ethnographic interviews seemed to
mesh with these other, more inchoate processes that partici-
pants were experiencing, particularly the search for a virtu-
ous self.
Hard Wires and Plastic Brains
These insights may have significant implications for addic-
tion, given the emphasis of the National Institute on Drug
Abuse (2014) on seeing addiction as a disorder or disease of
the brain. Rather than arguing that addiction is "hard-wired"
into the brain, the research on mindfulness and meditation
suggests that the brain itself is malleable, responds dynami-
cally to both internal and external events, and that patterns of
reaction can be altered. In other words, our brains' wiring is
softer than we may often suspect. This aligns with recent
research on epigenetics, which suggests that very little of our
behavior is determined directly by our genes. As a species,
we are characterized by "extraordinary behavioral plastic-
ity": our physical environments, mental states, and human
bodies are in constant interaction throughout our lifetimes;
(Jablonka & Lamb, 2014, p. 209).
According to Treadway and Lazar (2009), "We now pos-
sess sufficient evidence to demonstrate that meditation is a
unique mental state--distinct from resting states--and that it
appears to promote long-term structural and functional
changes in brain regions important for performing clinically
relevant functions" (p. 54). Kahneman (2011) contends that
our brains contain two corollary systems, one, unconscious,
automatic, and fast (System 1) and the other conscious,
deliberative, and slow (System 2). For those in active addic-
tion, the fast or "hot" System 1 would seem to be the one that
predominates; for them, it is often difficult to step back and
think before reacting to a situation because they are stuck in
the neural "now" (Lewis, 2011).
This also implies that the brain can be trained to bargain
between its dopamine-induced focus on the "now" and the
rewards to be gained by waiting, or abstaining. The ethno-
graphic interview might provide some of the structure and
distance that individuals need to develop their System 2, by
pushing them to engage in the "slow" processes of reflection
and analysis. In other words, the achievement of mindfulness
may actually contribute physiologically to the process of
recovery. Ethnographic interviews may have therapeutic
value because they facilitate the construction and elaboration
of such mental tools as self-awareness and reflection.
For the ethnographer, on the other hand, it may be System
1 that needs to be more vigorously exercised in the course of
the interview, and System 2 that needs to take a rest. In other
words, ethnographers need to learn how to be aware in the
moment. In an influential article written for physicians,
Epstein (1999) usefully listed the characteristics of mindful
practice, including "Active observation of oneself, the
patient, and the problem," "Critical curiosity," "Willingness
to examine and set aside categories and prejudices," and
"Humility to tolerate awareness of one's areas of incompe-
tence," in addition to the essentially Buddhist principle,
"Adoption of a beginner's mind" (p. 835). These qualities
seem equally desirable in ethnographers.
Likewise, Gonzalez-Lopez (2011) has related the concept
of mindfulness to the practice of sociological research:
"Becoming mindful as a researcher, therefore, has helped me
become keenly aware of and present in the social contexts
and circumstances surrounding the everyday life experiences
of the people who participate in my research" (p. 448). We
need to recognize that our preconceptions and ideas about
the world may be just as entrenched as those of physicians,
and we may also need to get out of our own way to actually
see and hear what is happening in the span of an interview,
and how we are emotionally and physically involved in the
interview.
Pagis (2010) discusses the tension between embodied and
abstract knowledge in relation to her study of Vipassana
meditation. In that setting, the challenge for meditators is to
connect their bodily experiences to the abstract body of
knowledge that they have learned through their studies of
Buddhism. The physical acts of meditation enable the practi-
tioner to feel the concepts, to experience them directly.
Likewise, Giardina and Newman (2011) examine ethno-
graphic research as a physical-cultural experience that
involves not just words but also bodies: our bodies and those
of the participants. Summers-Effler,Van Ness, and Hausmann
(2015) argue that the response of neural mirroring, an auto-
matic physiological reaction to the emotions and expressions
of others, is currently underutilized in ethnographic research,
and that "extra-deliberative perception, emotion and action"
(p. 455) ought to be incorporated into our analysis of inter-
views and other ethnographic encounters.
Much contemporary qualitative health research is embed-
ded within mixed-methods study designs and intended to
achieve specific goals: for example, to add context to quanti-
tative findings or to open up new avenues of questioning for
future research. Murphy and Dingwall (2003) contend that
the value of qualitative research lies not in its privileged
access to "insider knowledge" achieved through immersion,
but rather in its flexibility and openness to discovery (p. 40).
In other words, ethnography's value often lies precisely in the
fact that researchers do not know what they will find. We con-
tend that this unanticipated finding should extend beyond the
textual contents of interviews and field notes, and include the
awareness of affects, emotions, physical reactions, and other
Draus et al. 9
extra-verbal communications and information that spill over
the edges of the research design and our formal instruments.
Conclusion
As Lefebvre (2014) put it, in Critique of Everyday Life, "the
person being interviewed slowly agrees to receive or to
release a portion of the `real': an aspect of the hidden drama,
the situation of his everyday reality" (pp. 1336-1337). When
this occurs, it is not simply a transfer of information; it is a
physical-emotional event to which we should be more atten-
tive. Like the authors cited above (Giardina & Newman,
2011; Pagis, 2010; Summers-Effler et al., 2015), we contend
that ethnographic research will be stronger when it learns to
incorporate affects, emotions, and the body into both its
research design and its findings. Awareness of our own emo-
tional-physical involvement in this process will actually
enhance the quality of our findings.
At this point, it might be possible to argue that ethnographic
interviews should be systematically employed as an aid to
mindfulness and a complement to recovery and that the bene-
fits of this inclusion be studied systematically. Incorporating
fresh insights from the fields of neurology and epigenetics may
also be beneficial to our practice. The brain functions of eth-
nographers and participants might be studied as an example of
neural coupling, and that the results of this combination should
be measured in terms of their impacts on quality of life, levels
of stress, recidivism rates, or other indices of well-being. We
would certainly not object to any of these being done.
However, we would like to conclude with a simpler point.
Beyond what it enables us to do, or what it accomplishes, in
terms of either research or recovery, the quality of being pres-
ent carries its own value. In the same way that the process of
recovery and the practice of mindfulness are not really about
meeting specific goals or endpoints, perhaps ethnographic
research is not really about achieving a perfect understanding,
or Verstehen (Fuchs, 2009). Instead, it is about getting to the
non-grasping moment when, in Frank's (2010) terms, the
story is allowed to breathe. As Clift (2014) beautifully illus-
trates in his account of running with homeless men and
women in Baltimore, ethnographic encounters with others
may leave us "simultaneously more aware and confused" (p.
497). He continues, "My struggle and discomfort, then, is the
space I try to work in, with, and through" (p. 503). Inside the
space of the interview, both the recovering person and the eth-
nographer may reap the unintended benefits of this dialogic
encounter.
