Algorhythmic governance:
Regulating the `heartbeat' of a
city using the Internet of Things
Claudio Coletta and Rob Kitchin
Abstract
To date, research examining the socio-spatial effects of smart city technologies have charted how they are reconfiguring
the production of space, spatiality and mobility, and how urban space is governed, but have paid little attention to how
the temporality of cities is being reshaped by systems and infrastructure that capture, process and act on real-time data.
In this article, we map out the ways in which city-scale Internet of Things infrastructures, and their associated networks
of sensors, meters, transponders, actuators and algorithms, are used to measure, monitor and regulate the polymorphic
temporal rhythms of urban life. Drawing on Lefebvre, and subsequent research, we employ rhythmanalysis in conjunction
with Miyazaki's notion of `algorhythm' and nascent work on algorithmic governance, to develop a concept of `algor-
hythmic governance'. We then use this framing to make sense of two empirical case studies: a traffic management system
and sound monitoring and modelling. Our analysis reveals: (1) how smart city technologies computationally perform
rhythmanalysis and undertake rhythm-making that intervenes in space-time processes; (2) distinct forms of algorhythmic
governance, varying on the basis of adaptiveness, immediacy of action, and whether humans are in-, on-, or, off-the-loop;
(3) and a number of factors that shape how algorhythmic governance works in practice.

Can I understand the heartbeat of a city? That is really
what it is. Whether it comes down to the smart lighting
or some app that tells me where I can park or where I
can't park, all of that stuff, rail, transport, any of that
information that I have just got at the touch of a but-
ton. . . So when I see a smart city it is basically under-
standing the heartbeat of the city, being informed
about it; that if there is any issues with it that it is
quite easy to find where those issues are. (Start-up

Introduction
Since the 1950s, with the introduction of Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, tech-
nology has been utilized to manage and control urban
systems in real-time, especially with respect to transpor-
tation, utilities and security, and to mediate the
rhythms of city life. In recent years, such dynamic regu-
lation and mediation has been widened and deepened
with the rollout of ubiquitous and pervasive computing
wherein computation is built into the fabric of urban
infrastructure and is accessible from any location and
on the move. As a consequence, a range of studies have
noted how the deployment of smart city technologies is
reconfiguring the production of space, spatiality and

mobility, and how urban space is governed (e.g., Crang
and Graham, 2007; Gordon and de Souza e Silva, 2011;
Kitchin and Dodge, 2011; Thrift and French, 2002).
However, while some research has considered the
effects of information and communication technologies
(ICTs) on time and space ­ e.g., creating time­space
compression, convergence and distanciation and alter-
ing socio-temporal relations (Castells, 1996), scant
attention has been paid to how the temporality of
cities is being reshaped by city systems that capture,
process and act on real-time data (cf. Kitchin, 2014;
Townsend, 2000; Willis, 2016). Moreover, time geog-
raphy has little considered the role of code and new
forms of urban Big Data in reshaping the temporality
of urban processes, systems and life (c.f. Crang et al.,
2007; Schwanen, 2007).
Smart city technologies ­ such as city operating
systems, urban control rooms, smart grids, sensor net-
works, smart parking, smart lighting, city dashboards
and real-time information apps ­ have a number
of transformative temporal effects (such as altering
temporal relations with respect to flexibility, nimble-
ness, pace, stasis/inertia, prioritization, distanciation,
tracking trends, forecasting, nowcasting, scheduling,
anticipation, and short-term/long-term planning), and
are open to framing and analysis through different
space/time perspectives ­ e.g., time geography
(Hagerstrand, 1970), space-time (Massey, 1992), rhyth-
manalysis (Lefebvre, 2004[1992]) and timespace (May
and Thrift, 2001). In this article, we focus attention on
how systems that utilize or form part of the Internet of
Things, and their associated networks of sensors,
meters, transponders, actuators and algorithms, are
being used to measure and regulate the concatenated
rhythms of the city. Drawing on Lefebvre (2004[1992]),
and subsequent research, we employ rhythmanalysis in
conjunction with Miyazaki's (2012, 2013a, 2013b)
notion of `algorhythm' and nascent work on algorith-
mic governance, to develop a concept of `algorhythmic
governance' ­ the way in which code and Big Data are
used to intervene and regulate the polymorphic tem-
poral rhythms of urban life.
To illustrate our argument, we detail two brief case
studies. First, traffic management and the on-going
work within a traffic control centre to gather real-time
data on traffic conditions and the rhythms of traffic
flow in order to dynamically manage a complex
network in flux and to keep traffic moving. Here, our
analysis utilizes ethnographic fieldwork in which one of
the authors spent time in a traffic control room obser-
ving the work of the intelligent transport system and its
controllers and managers, and on a set of related
interviews. Second, real-time sound monitoring utiliz-
ing a network of sensors, wherein the data are fed back
to city managers and analyzed, and shared with the
public through a city dashboard. Here, our analysis
draws on a set of interviews with system developers
and those that analyze, utilize and share the data.
In both cases, the interviews are drawn from a larger
set of 77 conducted with city workers and stakeholders
involved in smart city initiatives in Dublin, Ireland.
These two case studies illustrate two different types of
algorhythmic governance: the first more interventionist,
adaptive and direct, wherein the on-going management
of a city system is over-determined by code; the second
more contextual or performance management orien-
tated, wherein the rhythms are measured, monitored,
recorded and modelled, with interventions more peri-
odic and indirect.
Rhythmanalysis and the (smart) city
Rhythmanalysis (2004[1992]) was the fourth and final
instalment in Henri Lefebvre's multi-volume work,
`Critique of Everyday Life' which was published
between 1947 and 1992. The book, published posthu-
mously, and was a key contribution, along with
The Production of Space (Lefebvre, 1991[1974]), to his
`attempt to get us both to think space and time
differently, and to think them together' (Elden, 2004:
ix, original emphasis). Lefebvre's 2004[1992]: 15) core
argument is that `[e]verywhere where there is inter-
action between a place, a time and an expenditure of
energy, there is rhythm', meaning that everyday life
unfolds within `patterns of flow that possess particular
rhythmic qualities' which produce a sense of continuity
and stability, or disjuncture (Edensor, 2010a: 3).
Peoples' lives therefore take place within a set of oscil-
lating space-times, some of which are encountered regu-
larly, some more periodically; or to put it another way:
`what we live are rhythms' (Lefebvre, 1991[1974]: 206).
Lefebvre identifies two main types of rhythms, linear
and cyclical repetition (Lefebvre, 2004[1992]: 8). As he
notes, people are often encountering and co-producing
several of rhythms simultaneously such that cities host
a series of `intersecting rhythms, including the poly-
rhythmic [multiple], eurhythmic [harmonious and
stable], isorhythmic [equal and in sync] and even
arrhythmic [out of sync and disruptive] measures as
well as secret, public, internal and external beats that
comprise the symphonic everyday' (Conlon, 2010: 72­
73). In other words, cities consist of a `multiplicity of
temporalities, some long run, some short term, some
frequent, some rare, some collective, some personal,
2 Big Data & Society 0(0)
some large-scale, some hardly noticed' (Crang, 2001:
190). These rhythms `may clash or harmonize, producing
reliable moments of regularity or less consistent vari-
ance' (Edensor and Holloway, 2008: 484). Thought
of in this way, places ­ the conjoining of space and
time ­ unfold as events, wherein multiple constellations
of trajectories, processes and temporalities `collide, syn-
chronise and interweave' (Jiron, 2010: 131).
A key aspect of how rhythms unfold, are maintained
and are discernible from noise, and also mutate, is repe-
tition. Basic elements of a rhythm are repeated to create
an order, a refrain. In Deleuze and Guattari's term
(1987[1980]), a refrain consists of `any aggregate of
matters of expression that draws a territory and devel-
ops into territorial motifs and landscapes'. Refrain is
rhythm that becomes expressive, and it is this refrain,
individually and collectively reproduced, that produces
ordered space-time (Spinney, 2010). As Brown and
Capdevila (1999: 36­37, cited in May and Thrift,
2001) explain, `[a] refrain. . . is a rhythmic series. . .
that creates, by its very repetition, a sense of the famil-
iar, a sense of place.' They elaborate that:
[a]s the territory becomes secured, so the refrain is
`picked up' or reiterated by others who come to
occupy the same space, much like the bird songs or,
they argue, cultural myths. Each time the refrain is
picked up, it is articulated anew, yet it still remains
recognisably the same repetitive series. (pp. 36­37)
Refrains enact what Deleuze and Guattari call
`productive repetition' (1987[1980]: 314): not simply
the return of the identical (`the reproductive meter'),
but the creation of difference. Here, `[t]ime is not an a
priori form; rather, the refrain is the a priori form of
time, which in each case fabricates different times'
(p. 348). As Lefebvre notes, `there is no identical abso-
lute repetition, indefinitely. As such, while a system
might work to try and maintain a refrain, to maintain
a eurhythmic state, it is always unfolding in a slightly
imperfect form, or it might be `punctured, disrupted or
curtailed by moments and periods of arrhythmia' and
dissolve into noise (Edensor and Holloway, 2008: 485).
Rhythms then are not already given, but emerge as
beats in the superposition of multiple and heteroge-
neous temporal flows and routines; these beats, in
turn, perform differences and require new attunements
to bring them into order.
As Elden (2004) details, Lefebvre uses rhythm not
just as an object of study, but also as a mode of ana-
lysis. Rhythmanalysis thus seeks to unpack the ways in
which time, space and lived experience are folded into,
conditioned by, and produced through various rhythms
(Edensor, 2010a; Lefebvre, 2004; May and Thrift,
2001). Lefebvre is fairly vague on what rhythmanalysis
looks like in practice, and those that have sought
to deploy his ideas empirically have used a range of
different methods (see Edensor, 2010b for examples).
As noted, our approach has been to use a combination
ethnography and interviews that have sought to under-
stand how city managers and the software-enabled sys-
tems they use measure and manage the polyrhythmic
city. Lefebvre (2004[1992]: 8) places particular focus on
measure contending that while `rhythm seems natural,
spontaneous, with no law other than its unfurling.. . .
Rhythm, always particular, (music, poetry, dance,
gymnastics, work, etc.) always implies a measure.
Everywhere where there is rhythm, there is measure,
which is to say law, calculated and expected obligation,
a project.'
The relationship between calculation and manage-
ment in producing urban rhythms is the empirical
focus of this article, with particular attention paid
to how new smart city technologies are being used
to mediate and regulate the multiple rhythms of cities;
to conduct a rhythmanalysis of the measure, work and
effects of Internet of Things infrastructures that seek to
limit arrhythmia and produce eurhythmic systems than
maintain refrain. As noted by a number of commenta-
tors, the monitoring, planning and coordination of
urban systems and services are increasingly being
mediated by software-enabled technologies processing
real-time data (Kitchin and Dodge, 2011; Luque-Ayala
and Marvin, 2016; Townsend, 2013). Here, governance
is delegated to digital infrastructures (DeNardis and
Musiani, 2016) and enacted through forms of `auto-
mated management' (Dodge and Kitchin, 2007),
wherein human and social action are increasingly
mediated by black-boxed algorithms that are inaccess-
ible to public scrutiny (Gillespie, 2014; Janssen and
Kuk, 2016; Pasquale, 2015). As a consequence, soft-
ware is re-framing time and temporality (Hassan and
Purser, 2007), and the space-times of cities are undergo-
ing significant change.
Although Lefebvre in his later years showed strong
interest in ICTs and their role in the capitalist mode of
production (Lefebvre, 1996), it is only in the last few
years that rhythmanalysis has been deployed for study-
ing the work of algorithms, for example in environmen-
tal (Palmer and Jones, 2014), energy (Walker, 2014)
and financial processes (Borch et al., 2015). However,
as noted by Borch et al. (2015) in their account of high
frequency trading in financial markets, `the bodily focus
of Lefebvre's project makes it unsuitable for fully
Coletta and Kitchin 3
grasping the development toward algorithmic trading'
(p. 1084), and by extension sensing infrastructures.
This is because, they explain, high-frequency trading
algorithms are `designed to detect and respond to
market rhythms' and the `rhythmic interactions
among algorithms take place in ways that are not
bodily founded or related' (p. 1084: original emphasis).
This is not to say that the rhythm of human bodies
is not attuned to trading markets, but algorithms are
largely working in ways independent of body rhythms.
A further shortcoming in Lefebvre's rhythmanalysis ­
as noted by Kofman and Lebas (1996: 48) ­ is the lack
of `a sustained analysis of the production of time,
although his analysis. . . certainly yield significant
insights on presence and absence, multiple temporal-
ities and the interplay of time and space'. If measure
and calculations are consitituve aspects of rhythms and
there is `no rhythm without repetition in time and in
space', and if repetition entails difference (Lefebvre
2004[1992]: 6), then a focus on algorithms suggests to
us a need to rethink measures, linearity and cycles as
effects of rhythm-making processes. Accordingly, the
multiple and entangled character of rhythms requires
the interaction between human bodies and everyday
life on the one hand and code and organizational pro-
cesses on the other to be accommodated, to which we
now turn.
Algorithms, governance and rhythms
Fundamentally, software is composed of algorithms ­
`sets of defined steps structured to process instructions/
data to produce an output' (Kitchin, 2017: 14).
Gillespie (2014) thus notes that all digital technologies
are `algorithm machines', able to tackle a diverse set
of tasks automatically, quickly, efficiently, effectively,
and inscrutably. Given these qualities, many aspects
of everyday life are increasingly being mediated, aug-
mented, produced and regulated by digital devices and
networked systems. As noted, this includes a diverse set
of city systems and infrastructure, where algorithms are
deployed to `search, collate, sort, categorise, group,
match, analyse, profile, model, simulate, visualise and
regulate people, processes and places' (Kitchin, 2017:
18). In turn, this has enabled new forms of algorithmic
governance to be enacted, whereby `algorithm machines'
are used to actively measure, monitor, manage and con-
trol populations and the space-times of cities.
In recent years there has been an increased focus on
the nature, working and effects of algorithmic govern-
ance across a range of domains (e.g., finance, health,
education, work). This has included research that has
examined and theorised how various forms of algorith-
mic governance is reshaping the management, control
and governmentality of space and mobility. For exam-
ple, Graham (2005) detailed processes of algorithmic
spatial sorting in which people are classified with
respect to place and differentially treated, and in later
work (2011) set out how cities were increasingly under
siege through various forms of automated surveillance
and regulation (e.g., CCTV, transactions, satellites,
drones, etc.). Amoore (2006, 2013) examined the use
of algorithmic regulation in border security, and in
the calculation and management of socio-spatial risks.
Kitchin and Dodge (2011) documented the various
ways in which people, objects, territories and transac-
tions are algorithmically tracked and acted upon, and
detailed forms of automated management in which
`algorithm machines' are ceded the power to act in
automatic, autonomous and automated ways. More
recently, Klauser et al. (2014) have examined the chan-
ging nature of governmentality enacted through the use
of smart metering and smart grids and Luque-Ayala
and Marvin (2016) have documented how new centra-
lized urban control rooms enact new forms of real-time
governmentality; Leszczynski (2015) has explored anxi-
eties of surveillance and control in an age of spatial Big
Data practices and dataveillance; Kitchin et al. (2015)
have detailed how new streams of urban Big Data and
city dashboards are enabling forms of new managerial-
ism, performance management and technocratic modes
of governance; and Kitchin (2016) has examined the
ethics of governing through smart city technologies
and issues of profiling, discrimination, bias, due pro-
cess, accountability.
In general, these studies have little considered the
ways in which algorithms are temporal in nature,
and at best only implicitly note the temporal as well
as spatial work of algorithmic governance and how
they mediate the rhythms of urban life. Here, we
want to consider the temporal dimensions of algorithms
and their work, reframing them as algorhythms that
produce modes of algorhythmic governance; that is,
structured forms of knowledge designed to create
euryhtmia ­ a familiar, desired refrain.
Miyazaki (2012, 2013a, 2013b) introduced the con-
cept of an `algorhythm', blending together the notion of
an algorithm's sequence of step-by-step instructions
with rhythm's time-based order of movement to con-
sider how computation `manifests itself as an epistemic
model of a machine that makes time itself logically con-
trollable and, while operating, produces measurable
time effects and rhythms' (2012: 5). Miyazaki (2013b:
520) contends `[a]lgorhythms are vibrational, pulsed
4 Big Data & Society 0(0)
and rhythmized signals constituted both by trans-
ductions of physical fluctuations of energy and their
oscillations as well as by abstract and logical structures
of mathematic calculations.' He shows how the micro-
temporal `agencement' of such algorhythms ­ namely
the technical and social linkages creating the
condition for actions (Hardie and MacKenzie, 2007) ­
produce and mediate everyday life, but can also gener-
ate major failures in networks and services, such as in
the cases of the AT&T telephone network crash in 1990
or the Flash Crash of the New York Stock Exchange in
2010. Likewise, Introna (2016: 21, original emphasis)
argues that algorithms have a temporal flow consisting
of `a continuous string or stream of interpenetrating ­
prior and subsequent ­ actions that compare, swap,
sort, allocate, administer, and so forth' where `[e]very
particular ``doing'' happening in the present already
assumes some inheritance from antecedent ``prior-to''
actions, and it already anticipates, or imparts to, the
subsequent ``in-order-to'' actions'.
While Introna (2016) emphasizes the polyrhythmic
concatenation of multiple computational systems,
wherein a number of algorhythms and temporal flows
intersect and interact, we are more interested in how
sequences and concatenations are repeated. Likewise,
while Miyazaki is concerned with conducting media
archaeologies of algorhythms and computing infra-
structures, we focus on how the rhythms of urban
systems and the space-time unfolding of place are
algorhythmically mediated; how forms of algorhythmic
governance are being produced that explicitly measure
and modulate urban rhythms ­ in our case the flow of
traffic and the fluctuations of noise. The challenge
here is to connect what Miyazaki (2012: 7) calls
`the time-boundedness of computational culture' to
the time-boundedness of governance cultures in order
to account for the interplay, interference and synchron-
ization of the multiple refrains of smart urbanism. As
Mackenzie (2005: 91) puts it, `[t]he problem, therefore,
is to find ways of articulating the uneven, mixed timings
that emerge within real networks of inter-operating sys-
tems,' acknowledging that algorithms are an essential
part of a larger framework, entangled and displaced in
a wide network of epistemic practices, organizations
and infrastructures (Dourish, 2016). Our approach is
thus to deploy a form of rhythmanalysis at the level
of an assemblage of related governmental technologies
­ the control room, a sound network ­ rather than
individual algorhythms; to examine how inter-related
sets of digital technologies work together or in conflict,
perform synchronization and interact through diverse
calculations and repetitions. Thus conceived,
algorhythmic governance can be considered as one of
the multifarious forms of urban governmentality enacted
by algorithms. As we detail elsewhere, urban informatics
are shifting governmentality from disciplinary forms to
those of social control; rather than governmentality
molding subjects and restricting action within spatial
enclosures, it seeks to modulate affects and channel
action across space (Kitchin et al., 2018).
Algorhythmic governance in practice
Traffic management
The Dublin Traffic Management and Incident Centre
(TMIC) provides a single, integrated, 24/7 control
room to house the core traffic management systems
for monitoring and controlling the road transportation
network and traffic flow in the Greater Dublin Area,
including dealing with major events and incidents.
The TMIC is located on the top floor of the Wood
Quay Building and access is restricted to selected per-
sonnel. The control room has nine main desks for oper-
ators, each provided with a computer, telephone,
CCTV control and three displays (see Figure 1), that
all face a large wall display with screens arranged in
multiple sections that show live traffic conditions and
allow controllers to share one of their screens with the
room. One of the desks is reserved for the control
room supervisor, one for a AA Roadwatch operator
(who communicates traffic news to radio stations
throughout the day), and three of the desks are reserved
for the Gardai´ (police service), Dublin Bus and ITS
(Intelligent Transportation System) staff. Three smaller
desks are located in the back left corner of the room
and hosts Dublin City FM's live broadcast of traffic
news and music between 7­10 a.m. and 4­7 p.m.,
Monday to Friday (staffed by a presenter, assistant
and producer; http://www.dublincityfm.ie/). In add-
ition to the main control room there is a smaller situ-
ation room with further screen and equipment to
manage special events, and a small kitchen.
The TMIC is a busy, time-critical environment,
with its own overlapping and intertwining everyday,
work, machinic and algorithmic polyrhythms operating
on different temporal cycles: the peaks of morning and
evening rush-hour; people entering or leaving the room
at breaks or as shifts change; the voice and music on the
radio; the operators typing at keyboards and switching
between cameras; and hurried conversations or jokes
and the sharing of screens as a situation unfolds. At
all times, real-time information is flowing into the
centre from a fixed network of 380 CCTV cameras,

Cams (traffic sensing cameras) used when induction
loops are faulty or the road surface is not suitable
for them, a mobile network of approximately 1,000

drivers if needed; see Figure 2), phone calls and mes-
sages by the public to radio stations and the operators,
and social media posts, which contingently and rela-
tionally shaping the core patterns of activity. At the

system, Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System
(SCATS).
SCATS is an automated and adaptive system for
managing the flow of traffic through a city. It synchron-
ises traffic lights automatically, calculating the timing
of signal cycles and phases at junctions depending
on traffic conditions in order to ensure the optimal
flow of vehicles and minimize congestion and man-
age incidents. In so doing, it dynamically manage the
polyrhythms of road transportation and pedestrian
crossings. A cycle is the wait time at a junction and is
subdivided into phases for different directions and types
(e.g., vehicles, cycles, pedestrians) of flow. It is adaptive
in the sense that the system automatically adjusts the
cycles and phases dependent on a set of programmed
rules and the volume of traffic in previous cycles and
phases. As McCann (2014: 8) details:
`SCATS has a hierarchical structure, featuring two dis-
tinct levels or layers of control: strategic and tactical.
At the tactical level, control is undertaken by the local
controller, allowing green phases to be terminated early
and omitting phases for which there is no demand.
Decisions are made based on information from vehicle
detectors at the junction. At the strategic level, the
regional computers use flow and occupancy data col-
lected from vehicle detectors to give coordination
between groups of junctions. Optimum cycle length,
phase splits, and offsets are determined on an area
basis, and not just for one junction.'
In effect, SCATS operates at three levels of control
(McCann, 2014): at the level of the single intersection,
a subsystem and a system. A subsystem is an amalgam
of closely related junctions, including a `critical' junc-
tion and adjacent minor junctions and pedestrian cross-
ings. `Within a subsystem, all junctions operate at the
same cycle time and will have offset values designed to
provide synchronisation between the junctions at all
times of day' (McCann, 2014: 15). The system level
seeks to provide coordination between subsystems by
linking them together using external offsets.
Across the subsystems and system, the adjustment
of time is based on the degree of saturation (DS), a
traffic demand measure, and managed strategically at
a regional computer. The DS algorithm measures
how effectively the road is used and what should be
the maximum flow allowed based on the number
of vehicles flowing through a junction in a given time
period. The DS indicates if the road usage is under
or over-saturated, which is then used by SCATS to
self-calibrate.1
As explained by the centre manager:
The SCAT system is set up with the various different
phases, the various different approaches it can run so it
can run the main road, side road, pedestrian, right
turns, whatever, so that is all set up by the staff here.
That is programmed into the traffic controller. When
the traffic controller gets switched on then there is an
initial set of times, but once it gets that initial set of
timings, SCATS itself will start to calibrate to the traffic
flow. So it self-calibrates to the traffic flow. And then
what it is looking to do is it is looking to equalize, to
balance the competing demands at junctions. So that is
the first thing it is trying to do. The second thing is,
depending on where those junctions are, we may then
decide they should be linked to each other to provide
progressional flow from one to the other. So it has got
to maintain coordination with its neighbors. [. . .]
During the heavy, busy hours, you might have a lot
of junctions along the road all linked to each other
for cordination purposes, but as the traffic need dies
down they could revert back to smaller and smaller
clusters of traffic controllers who just respond more
to their local needs, so they perform better just at
their local needs. (Senior executive officer #1, Local
Authority, our emphasis)
Calculations, calibrating processes and practices are at
the core of the production of linear and cyclic rhythms:
time is not given, but is built through the interaction of
multiple adjustments which shape the measurement and
practices of rhythms. Indeed, calibration as defined by
the Oxford English Dictionary2 refers both to an act of
measurement (`to determine the correct value') and to
an act of modification and adaptation (`to graduate
objects for any irregularities'). Thus, the calibration
takes into account the interactions within the TMIC
as performed by the controllers as well as the flows of
traffic and pedestrians, who through their movements
and actions at a junction contribute to and are affected
by the system's algorhythms. For example, by pressing
a pedestrian crossing button at junction, people pro-
duce a temporary break in the traffic rhythm closing
down the main phase in order to run the pedestrian
phase. Similarly, the number of cars and the gaps
between them detected by the induction loops commu-
nicates if a phase was too short or long and the next
phase time is re-calculated automatically by the SCAT
system. Public buses benefit from prioritisation, so as
they approach a junction the phasing will alter to
accommodate their passage, generating a further alter-
ation of traffic rhythms that need to be managed by the
Coletta and Kitchin 7
software, and which sometimes produces congestion in
the other phases. Cycles are set to last a minimum of
40 seconds to a maximum 130 seconds, but in practice
they rarely exceed 80 seconds or go below 60 seconds.
This is based on the pragmatic evaluation that the wait-
ing time for a pedestrian crossing above 80 seconds
would be too long:
`So then that means that throughout the day when it is
not busy the cycle goes between 60 and 80 seconds
which just means that if a person is waiting at the
side of the road they are not waiting too long, or the
people at the side roads are not waiting too long.
Because if you have everything at 120 and all the add-
itional [time] goes to the main road you could be sitting
on the side road for maybe 80 seconds which is a very
long time.' (Senior execuive officer #2, Local Authority)
Calibration is strictly related to repetition: the repeated
passage of cars at specific intervals of time produce a
temporal pattern that SCATS uses to adjust the phases.
The association of calibration and repetition through
calculation produce the refrain of traffic management.
Refrains enable data actionability and accountability,
and are used by ITS staff to configure the setting of
SCATS taking into account whether it is a weekday
or weekend, as well as seasonal/daily rhythms and
when schools are closed. Consequently, each phase of
each junction has its own temporal rhythms which can
be discerned over time. Figure 3 displays an average
(over 4 months) flow of traffic through one junction
phase over 24 hours for each day of the week, showing
a morning and late afternoon/evening peaks for week-
days, but early afternoon peaks at the weekend.
On the management side, operators can intervene
and override the original SCATS settings, as well as
its present conditions. Figure 4 shows the SCATs inter-
face as interacted with by a controller, with the right-
hand part of the screen showing a junction and its
phases, and the left hand part the length of time for
each phase. Interventions are circumscribed by the con-
figuration of the system by ITS staff, which in turn refer
to the Traffic Signs Manual by the National Roads
Authority,3 which gives rules on the minimum and
maximum times for phases. If, for example, operators
try to go below the minimum safety times for green or
red time on a different phase SCATS will automatically
override the modification attempt with the original
configuration:
We have a number of rules and a number of different
elements that you do, so you draw a diagram of what
your phasing is going to be, you then define what signal
groups can run at the same time as the other, you give
basic timings, you give minimal times for your pedes-
trian crossings, you calculate what the critical collision
point is, so what phases. How long the inter-green time
has been the different phases and any other require-
ments that you want to have, i.e. if you want phases
to be allowed to be controlled by different factors, so if
you turn on switches or turn on different things, differ-
ent things happen. (Senior executive officer #2, Local
Authority)
As well as directly altering the phasing of junctions
and the rhythms of traffic flow, much of the data uti-
lised in the traffic control room is shared with the public
via a number of channels, enabling people to see and

interpret the data themselves and self-regulate their
interactions with the traffic system and to manage
time-based decisions for journey planning. For exam-
ple, real-time information about the expected real-time
of buses and Luas trams are shared via smartphone
apps,4 websites5 and on-street signs (see Figure 5).
The Dublin Dashboard6 provides real-time information
on the estimated travel time along road segments, the
number of spaces in the car parks, the number of bikes
and free stands in the bike-share system, and snap-shots
from a number of CCTV cameras (see Figure 6).
In addition, many travelers can use GPS navigation
systems that automatically re-route drivers in response
to real-time updates, often taken from other real-
time datasets; for example, Google-based GPS
(App: `Maps ­ Navigation & Transit') calculates traffic
congestion based on the movement of Android phones.
Sound monitoring and modelling
In 2002 the EU Environmental Noise Directive
(2002/49/EC7) was issued, designed to measure noise
pollution levels in urban areas and on major roads
and to trigger necessary noise reduction measures.
The directive requires member states to monitor noise
levels and share these with the public, and prepare and
publish every five years noise maps and noise manage-
ment action plans. The directive was enshrined in Irish
law as the Environmental Noise Regulations (Statutory
Instrument No. 140 of 2006). As a consequence, Dublin

City Council (DCC) (as well as the other three Dublin
local authorities) is obliged to measure, model and
publish noise levels across its jurisdiction. DCC sub-
contracts this service to a private, Dublin-based start-
up company, Sonitus Systems, who deploy an Internet
of Things solution using networked sound sensors
located in 14 locations (40 across the city as a whole).
The sound levels recorded by the monitoring stations
are displayed via an interactive map8 and specific
site graphs,9 enabling the public to read daily and
longer-term sound levels for each station, and compare
different locations (see Figure 7). As one our inter-
viewees explained:
`[O]ur system is constantly measuring noise levels, 24/7,
it makes an average every five minutes, or every five
minutes it logs a reading, and then it uploads that auto-
matically to our server. And we take all that data
coming in, a reading every five minutes from 40 sites
all over the city, and we turn that into useful informa-
tion about what is happening in areas around the city
by processing it, by averaging it, by comparing it with
other sites and by providing a set of tools online to let
either our customer or the general public analyze what
is happening one day to the next, over time, and look at
it in longer-term trends over time. (Start-up entrepre-
neur #2)
The consequence is that the city now has `millions and
millions of measurements, six metrics taken every five
minutes for the last five years at a dozen different points
around the city' (company manager), which are made
available for scrutiny through a web-based software
platform and forms part of the database for noise
modelling (see Figure 8). To produce noise maps at a
finer resolution than the sound monitors enable, the
data are complemented by `road surface and gradient,
number of vehicles and speed of the traffic, positions of
buildings and barriers and the topology of the local
area' and are modelled using predictive software to pro-
duce day-time and night-time maps.10
Here, quite literally we have a set of algorhythms at
work, algorithmically measuring, processing and ana-
lyzing urban sound and its rhythms. As with the traffic
management system, the rhythms detected are affected
by calibration, initial settings and the equipment used.
As one of our interviewees describes with respect to an
air quality sensor network:
Interviewee: It takes time to understand whether sen-
sors work or not. You need to choose the interval in
which you retrieve the data. Because if you retrieve
them at the second scale, you have plenty of informa-
tion, but there also can be much noise. If you retrieve
them at the hour scale it is more normal but you can

Coletta and Kitchin 11
lose information, so you need to find a compromise, the
right balance.
Interviewer: Also in relation with the times of the city:
morning, peak hours, evening. . .
Interviewee: Exactly. Then the higher the resolution,
the higher the consumption of battery; the more you
keep data in the flashcard, the more you have to trans-
mit them. There is a whole series of compromises you
need to deal with. (Environmental engineer, University)
The calculation of the measurement interval thus
requires a compromise between the resolution of infor-
mation and noise, and to take into account battery cap-
acity and maintenance. The resolution is also often
shaped by the type of communications network
deployed to relay data. Sending data via GSM can be
expensive over time, encouraging lower resolution trans-
fers. In Dublin, a Low-Power Wide-Area Network
(LPWAN) is being tested which allows long range com-
munication at a low bit rate and is specifically designed
for battery-powered Internet of Thing devices and to
support low cost sensors. In other words, the rhythm
and resolution of the data measurement and transfer ­
every five seconds, every minute, every hour, every day ­
is technically mediated. Again, calibration is coupled
with repetition and produces the refrain that enables
the accountability and actionability of data.
Discussion and conclusions:
Algorhythmic governance, refrains and
rhythm-making
The concept of algorhythmic governance expresses the
existence of scalable dynamics generated by the inter-
play of calibration and repetition that create refrains
that make computation, management and policies
accountable and actionable. Rhythm-making takes
place in different organizations and they are ongoing,
open, dispersed, loosely connected, performative, pre-
scriptive and manipulable. In rhythmanalytical terms,
the SCATS software and the operators in the TMIC,
and the Sonitus sound monitoring network and sound
modellers, are undertaking rhythmanalysis ­ that is,
they are seeking to measure and reveal the polyrhythms
of the city. But they are also rhythm-makers, in that
they actively seek to mediate and calibrate repetitions
and rhythms in the world ­ to try and minimize differ-
ence and arrhythmia (disruptive, out-of-sync disjunc-
tions) and produce eurhythmia (harmonious, stable,
familiar refrain) which in turn produces further differ-
ence and possible arrhythmia enacting particular

(and unstable) space-times. Similarly, people who
access the data produced within both domains through
apps, websites and on-street signs seek to undertake
their own rhythmanalysis that shapes their space-time
decision-making, and whose subsequent actions collect-
ively and cumulatively alter the rhythms of the city.
Our analysis highlights that while both the traffic
control room and the sound network enact algorhyth-
mic governance, it is clear that they do so in different
ways. Both systems are highly automated with respect
to data generation, transmission, processing, analysis
and sharing. They differ, however, with respect to
their adaptiveness and action.
SCATS is an adaptive system in two respects. First,
the regulation of the phases and cycles adapts to the
demand at junctions and across the road network and
certain priority rules. This process is a form of auto-
mated management as defined by Dodge and Kitchin
(2007), in which the system makes and enacts auto-
mated, automatic and automated decisions. Second,
unlike automated management in its pure form, a
human controller can intervene, within certain param-
eters, to over-ride the automated adaptions and re-cali-
brate the system. In this sense, the system is one of
human-on-the-loop (rather than human-off-the-loop),
wherein the system works in an automated fashion but
under the watch of a human controller who can inter-
vene (Docherty, 2012). Moreover, the system enacts real-
time actions and has real-time effects, with the phases
and cycles of traffic lights at key junctions being dynam-
ically changed. As a result, every two cycles the length of
time vehicles wait at junction updates; the system has
immediate material actions designed to produce a
desired space-time rhythm. However, due to the poly-
rhythmic and complex nature of cities, and the mutable
cyclicality and linearity of algorhythms, the results are
never a perfect flow, but rather a semi-optimal concat-
enation that seeks to stave off inertia or chaos.
In contrast, the sound network is fixed and non-adap-
tive beyond periodic system upgrades. The system
simply generates sensor measurements, transmits them
back to a central database, and updates a set of web-
based visualizations. Moreover, it engenders no immedi-
ate material action. Instead, the data is used to build up
sound profiles of key locations over time and is com-
bined with other data to produce sound models for the
city. These data and models are then used as the basis for
identifying and implementing noise reduction policies.
In other words, algorhythms form the basis of measuring
and monitoring noise levels, and for justifying govern-
ance interventions, but the system does not directly inter-
vene in action. As such, the noise monitoring networks
constitutes a form of algorhythmic governance that is
not yet fully automated or self-calibrating.
The two case studies thus reveal two different
forms of algorhythmic governance which each enact a
different type of rhythmanalysis and perform different
kinds of rhythm-making. It is our contention that there
are many more forms of algorhythmic governance.
The most obvious third form is one where humans
are off-the-loop, wherein an algorhythmic system has
been delegated the responsibility and authority to pro-
cess data and make decisions and act upon them with-
out any human input or interaction (Docherty, 2012).
Indeed, there is a need to explore further the ways in
which algorhythmic governance is co-created by algo-
rithms and actors and the ways in which each shapes
the other. Within each form of algorhythmic govern-
ance, there will be variability in how the mode of gov-
ernance of operates and how it is actioned, dependent
on a number of factors ­ data generated, technology
(e.g., sensors used, network infrastructure, battery life),
epistemic practices, epistemology (mode of analysis,
visualization), and forms of regulation and control
exercised (in the case of human-off-the-loop varying
from automated fines, to altering phases and cycles,
to killing people as with military drones).
In each case, a combination of heterogeneous and
layered timings and devices, and practices of continuous
maintenance and calibration designed to balance and
equalize repetitions and minimize difference, is enacted.
As our case studies highlight, a number of other issues
are also raised. For example, how and where the net-
works of sensors are set up and calibrated: decisions that
establish a traffic cycle of 2 minutes with different
phases, or a time frequency of 5 minutes, affects the
actionability of data and the capability of actors to
monitor, detect and intervene. The sensitivity of sensors,
local conditions, scientific norms and handling proced-
ures can add noise to the measurements, which can also
be biased and contain error (Kitchin et al., 2015).
Indeed, there are always concerns over data fidelity, pre-
cision, representativeness, cleanliness, consistency, and
reliability of measurements, and the extent to which
these affect calculations. Moreover, calibration and fil-
tering the signal from noise is reliant on computational
procedures to extract meaningful information, which
influence the derived data. And given the polyrhythms
and unfolding nature of cities, there is no established or
stable norm against which such calibrations are being
made; to degree then, adaptive systems such as traffic
management are self-organizing, with system rules and
human interventions based on a rule of thumb garnered
from controller experience.
Coletta and Kitchin 13
There are also questions of transparency and
accountability with respect to such algorhythmic govern-
ance. Within automated systems, the rules for acting on
data and making decisions is largely black-boxed, espe-
cially for ordinary citizens. Yet it is known that pro-
grammers routinely, if unintentionally, change the
substance of rules when translating them into computer
code, thus altering the regulatory work they do
(Citron, 2007­2008). Moreover, weak algorithms and
dirty or error-prone data can generate high rates of
false positives and baseless decision making. As a
result, the result, the `transparency, accuracy, and polit-
ical accountability of administrative rulemaking' are
potentially lost and are difficult to challenge (Citron,
2007­2008: 1254).
To conclude, there is clearly much more research to
be undertaken to more fully chart the nature, workings
and forms of algorhythmic governance, the various
issues shaping and arising from their use, and how
they perform rhythmanalysis and rhythm-work in
order to mediate the polymorphic temporal rhythms
of urban life. Indeed, the city itself has an institutional
and historical `heartbeat' that interact and is difficult to
attune with the real-time one of smart urbanism, as one
of our interviewee remarked:
When you think about the physical city you have to
think in terms of the pulse rate being 30 years, a heart-
beat in Dublin terms is 30 years because that is how
long it takes to conceive of and build a bridge. You are
looking at timelines that are not driven by electronic
Internet time clocks.. . . Whereas you talk through
problems like homelessness. . . and that is a very imme-
diate sharp focus problem, depending on government
policy it may be more or less of a problem in a particu-
lar month, year and so on. So there are many different
timelines and tracks within a city. (Manager, large
company)
Algorhythmic governance is the (semi)automated
endeavour to combine of all these heterogeneous and
layered timings and devices, where the effort to cali-
brate, balance and equalize the heartbeat of the city
generates both regulation and interference, entangling
`real-time', past and future, and acting `at the same
time' on different scales.

1. `[T]he space-time for the previous cycle is being compared
to the cycle at max-flow to determine if it is under or
over-saturated. This is achieved by taking the average
space-time at max-flow (t) and multiplying it by the
number of vehicles (n), to give a value of T[otal space

flow; this is then compared to the actual T recorded for
the measured cycle'. (McCann, 2014). For the detailed
