Abstract
Background
Traditional healers are acceptable and highly accessible health practitioners throughout
sub-Saharan Africa. Patients in South Africa often seek concurrent traditional and allopathic
treatment leading to medical pluralism.
Methods & findings
We studied the cause of five traditional illnesses known locally as "Mavabyi ya nhloko" (sick-
ness of the head), by conducting 27 in-depth interviews and 133 surveys with a randomly
selected sample of traditional healers living and working in rural, northeastern South Africa.
These interviews were carried out to identify treatment practices of mental, neurological,
and substance abuse (MNS) disorders. Participating healers were primarily female (77%),
older in age (median: 58.0 years; interquartile range [IQR]: 50­67), had very little formal
education (median: 3.7 years; IQR: 3.2­4.2), and had practiced traditional medicine for
many years (median: 17 years; IQR: 9.5­30). Healers reported having the ability to success-
fully treat: seizure disorders (47%), patients who have lost touch with reality (47%), paralysis
on one side of the body (59%), and substance abuse (21%). Female healers reported a
lower odds of treating seizure disorders (Odds Ratio (OR):0.47), patients who had lost touch
with reality (OR:0.26; p-value<0.05), paralysis of one side of the body (OR:0.36), and sub-
stance abuse (OR:0.36) versus males. Each additional year of education received was
found to be associated with lower odds, ranging from 0.13­0.27, of treating these symp-
toms. Each additional patient seen by healers in the past week was associated with roughly
1.10 higher odds of treating seizure disorders, patients who have lost touch with reality,
paralysis of one side of the body, and substance abuse. Healers charged a median of 500
South African Rand (~US$35) to treat substance abuse, 1000 Rand (~US$70) for seizure

Conclusions
While not all healers elect to treat MNS disorders, many continue to do so, delaying allo-
pathic health services to acutely ill patients.
Introduction
Mental health, neurological, and substance abuse disorders (MNS) are the leading cause of dis-
ability worldwide, accounting for 28.5% of all years lived with disability[1] Despite this global
burden, fewer than 25% of affected individuals ever access mental health or neurological treat-
ment [2]; in low and middle income countries (LMICs), utilization is much lower [3]. In sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA), MNS are largely neglected, misdiagnosed, or mistreated [4]. The process
of integrating mental health services into primary health care has been delayed in part by con-
straints in health infrastructure in rural areas, and service availability is usually limited to ter-
tiary psychiatric facilities [5,6]. In South Africa, 16.5% of adults suffered from a common
mental disorder (anxiety, depression, substance abuse) in the past year; only 5.6% of those
with a disorder received allopathic health treatment [7]. MNS services are now being intro-
duced in primary care facilities in an effort to engage patients with lower incomes and those
living in rural areas, yet integration is slow [4]. The recognition of the paucity of allopathic
mental health care providers in South Africa's public sector--there are only 0.4 psychiatrists
and 0.3 psychologists per 100,000 people [8]­has led to innovative solutions, including task
sharing models being proposed and recently adopted in the government's Mental Health Pol-
icy Framework and Action Plan (2013­2020)[9]. However, even with these innovative policies,
challenges in implementing the integration remain [10].
It is widely believed in SSA that traditional healers have the unique ability to diagnose and
treat physical and emotional conditions brought about by such causes as social misconduct,
spirits, spells, and sorcery, which allopathic clinicians lack the ability to treat [11­14]. Addi-
tionally, healers typically speak patients' preferred local languages, are often living closer to
and more readily available to attend to patients, and allocate more time to explain diagnoses,
causes of illnesses, and treatments with patients [15]. Traditional healers may be able to pro-
vide therapy and services that allopathic health systems are not able to provide. Motivated by
these factors, as well as limitations amidst the allopathic workforce and infrastructure, patients
experiencing a variety of acute and chronic mental and physical health concerns often frequent
a traditional healer instead of, or in conjunction with, seeking allopathic services [15­19]. This
type of medical pluralism, combined with the present divide between the traditional and allo-
pathic systems, results in patients "ping-ponging" between the two systems, often receiving
insufficient care to sustainably improve their health and well-being [7,17]. Among patients
who do receive mental health services, few receive counseling or support for long-term treat-
ment adherence. Widespread social stigma surrounding mental health illness and lack of per-
ceived appropriate biomedical care results in avoidance of health-seeking behaviors for
suspected MNS disorders [20,21]. Little community outreach is done to educate affected fami-
lies. These barriers often lead to delayed, intermittent or abandoned biomedical care resulting
in increased morbidity and mortality [1,14,22­29]. Traditional healers, given their respected
position within the community, physical proximity to patients and cultural understanding

may be able to overcome a number of these traditional barriers to support the provision of
integrated mental health care.
Among South Africans with a chronic DSM-IV diagnosis in 2009, 29% reported seeking
allopathic care, 9% sought traditional care, and 11% saw a spiritual or religious advisor. Predic-
tors for seeking traditional care were older age, black race, lower education level, unemploy-
ment, and experiencing anxiety or substance abuse issues [30]. Patients continue to seek
traditional care for MNS ailments, and healers continue to treat patients for these disorders
[30,31]; however, there is a paucity of information available regarding the frequency and types
of treatments for MNS illnesses offered by traditional healers working in South Africa. More
information is needed concerning which MNS conditions healers elect to treat, beliefs about
disease etiology, treatment methods undertaken, and the cost for treatment. We conducted
this mixed-methods study with a sample of local traditional healers to investigate which MNS
conditions traditional healers treat and the cost of treatment as well as the traditional healers'
willingness to work with the allopathic health care system.
Methods
Study location
We conducted this study in the sub-district of Agincourt located in the Bushbuckridge area of
Mpumalanga province in South Africa, roughly 500 km northeast of Johannesburg. The MRC/
Wits Agincourt Research Unit (www.agincourt.co.za) manages the Agincourt Health and
Socio-Demographic Surveillance Site (HDSS), which since 1992 has continuously undertaken
population-based health and demographic research [32­34]. The Agincourt HDSS population
is made up of approximately 115,000 residents living across roughly 21,000 households within
31 research villages. About one-third of the HDSS population, which is mainly xi-Tsonga-
speaking, is made up of Mozambican refugees (or descendants of) who had immigrated to
South Africa in the 1980s. The research site includes seven government-run health clinics
(providing free, basic outpatient care, including immunization, family planning, testing and
treatment for sexually transmitted infections, minor trauma and chronic disease care), one
public-private community health center (focusing on HIV and tuberculosis treatment as well
as chronic non-communicable disease treatment), and one sizeable public health center,
which provides 24-hour maternity care as well as acute care and 48-hour patient observation.
Patients seen at the health centers are referred, when needed, to three district hospitals, each
located roughly 25­55 km from the site, generally requiring public transport for travel.
Study population
We used this registration list of the Kukula Traditional healer organization to randomly sam-
ple participants through the random selection function in Stata1 (StataCorp, LP, College Sta-
tion, Texas, USA).[35] The Kukula Traditional Healer organization is an organization of
roughly 300 registered traditional healers who work within the Bushbuckridge area and is the
only organized group of healers living in the region. Out of a total of 280 registered healers,
169 were randomly selected to participate (using Stata1 13); of these four no longer lived in
the research area, and five had since died (95% response rate). Each of the remaining 160 heal-
ers who were approached accepted to participate in the study (i.e., 100% acceptance rate). We
conducted qualitative interviews until data saturation around attitudes towards mental health
treatment practices was reached. We enrolled 133 participants in the quantitative portion of
our study to ensure we could estimate (with 95% confidence) the proportion of healers who
treated HIV (the focus of a related study with the same population of healers) with a precision
of 6%.

Data collection
With the random sample of traditional healers from the Bushbuckridge area we conducted 27
qualitative interviews and 133 surveys between July 2014 and August 2015. In-depth interviews
(IDIs) were completed first in order to gather data regarding the illnesses healers treated,
which they felt they had treated most effectively, causes of those illnesses, their preferred treat-
ment methods, service fees charged to patients, and their thoughts about the ability of allo-
pathic medicine to treat these illnesses. Specifically, healers described the symptoms they could
effectively treat or cure, and were asked the xi-Tsonga and English word for that illness (if
known). All interviews and surveys were conducted using the xi-Tsonga disease name identi-
fied by the healers during qualitative interviews.
The IDIs were conducted in the language the traditional healer was most conversant in
(mainly xi-Tsonga) in the location of the traditional healer's choosing (generally, in the tradi-
tional healer's home or place of work) by a trained qualitative study team member (SN). Inter-
views lasted an average of 61 minutes during which we asked healers, what types of traditional
mental illnesses they treated, the symptoms associated with each illness, what treatments they
could provide, patient prognosis, and what, if any, allopathic diagnosis they associated with
the traditional diagnosis.
Based on findings from the IDIs, we developed quantitative surveys to determine which ill-
ness(es) healers treated, their thoughts on the effectiveness of treatments they provide, and fees
charged. MNS-specific illnesses focused on included: (1) seizure disorders; (2) patients who
have lost touch with reality; (3) paralysis on one side of the body, and (4) substance abuse
(drug and alcohol abuse). Data was also gathered regarding the number and type of patient
diagnoses within the previous seven and 30-day time periods.
Data availability
Data are available on the Harvard dataverse at http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TAJKBK.[36]
Data analysis
Participant characteristics, service provision, and cost per service were presented as frequen-
cies with percentages, means, and medians with interquartile ranges (IQR). Multivariable
logistic regression was used to model the odds of treating select MNS disorders, including sei-
zure disorders, patients who have lost touch with reality, substance abuse, and paralysis on one
side of the body, which is often associated with stroke. All regressions reported in this study
were adjusted for age, level of education, immigrant status, number of patients per month, and
type of healer.
Within two weeks of conducting the interview the qualitative data were transcribed into the
local language and were then translated into English (as needed). Two research team members
with considerable experience conducting qualitative research completed the thematic analysis
using MAXQDA1 (VERBI GmbH, Berlin, Germany) software. Coding was carefully
reviewed for agreement; comparison of coding for the first five interviews found 90% agree-
ment using Cohen's Kappa in MAXQDA1. Any incongruities in coding were resolved
through consensus.
Ethical approvals
Approval was received for this study from the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board (IRB #
140646) and the University of Witwatersrand Institutional Review Board (IRB #140547). All
study participants provided written informed consent.

Results
Traditional healer demographics
Healers sampled from the rural Bushbuckridge area were predominantly female (77%), older
(58 years; interquartile range [IQR]: 50­67), had long-term experience practicing traditional
medicine (17 years; IQR: 9.5­30), and had low formal education levels (3.7 years; IQR: 3.2­
4.2). Ninety-two healers (69%) self-identified primarily as an Inyanga (herbalist) healer, while
34 (26%) self-identified as a Sangoma (divine treatment) healer, and 5% identified as "other".
Participating healers who were actively treating patients at the time of the study reported see-
ing a median of three patients in the previous week. Slightly more than half the responding
healers reported no association with any particular religion (n = 68, 52%), while the most com-
mon self-identified affiliations were Zion (n = 19, 15%), Apostolic (n = 11, 9%), and Bandla
Lama Nazaretha (n = 10, 8%). Healers were asked if they, their parents and/or grandparents
had emigrated from Mozambique, to which 94 (71%) responded positively; however, only 4
(3%) reported fluency in Portuguese. Healers reported their most commonly spoken languages
as: xi-Tsonga (n = 130, 98%), isiZulu (n = 40, 30%), English (n = 12, 9%), and Xhosa (n = 8,
6%).
Diagnosis and treatment
Perceived ability to diagnosis and treat. Healers claimed the ability to successfully treat
the following MNS illnesses: seizure disorders (47%), patients who had lost touch with reality
(47%), patients with depressive symptoms (22%), patients with paralysis on one side of the
body (59%), and substance abuse (21%) (Table 1). Collectively, healers reported that in the
month prior to their survey interview, they treated two adults and three children with seizure
disorders, five adults and one child who had lost touch with reality, two adults who had experi-
enced paralysis on one side of the body, and six adults who were `possessed by an evil spirit'. In
addition, healers provided medications to seven infants to prevent the development of seizure
disorders.
Many interviewees alluded to a long-standing history of healers treating mental illness and
related disorders; as one healer explained, "It is a natural illness and even in the past the tradi-
tional healers were treating patients with mental illness and even now they are still treating them
and they get cured" (male, 59 years). Some healers acknowledge that they are able to diagnose
and know the cause of their patients' illnesses without testing: "we have been given that gift as
seer" (female, 54 years). For others, the possibility of curing a mental illness depends on how
long the patient has had symptoms, for example, "if . . . it has started last month or two months
back, I will cure that person but if it's after some years, no I will not able to cure that person

because the illness is very strong in his body" (male, 31 years). Further still, not all healers are
confident in their ability to treat, or may lack any desire to attempt to treat mental illness or
MNS disorders; as one healer revealed, "I am scared of people with mental illness . . . my father
was treating people with mental illness and when he try to teach me I said no, I don't want to do
this" (female, 74 years). Some healers intimated that certain mental illnesses cannot be cured:
"What I can tell you is that mental illness is incurable; there are times when it will come again"
(female, 43 years), but may be controlled with recurrent traditional treatments: "When you
have mental illness you have to go to the healer who treated you after a year so that he can give
you the treatment again" (male, 67 years).
Seizure disorders (xi-Tsonga name: Mavabyi ya ku wa). Forty-seven percent of healers
believed they could successfully treat adults experiencing Mavabyi Ya Ku Wa. There was
strong agreement about the symptoms and cause of seizure disorders. On healer explained
"It's a snake that causes it, you find that the snake that is inside turn and it cause him to have
seizure. People live with many organs in their body, there is a snake that allows food to enter
and there is a snake that gives life; the one that allow food is working together with the one in
the brain. If the snake can turn and look down and then it will cause seizure to a person. . .
When a person has the illness he will start by looking like he is lonely, after that he will have
seizure." (male, 67 years) The snake is also thought to cause seizures in children, although the
symptoms were described slightly differently. "When the child is born you find that she has
hiccups and most of the time and it is a snake that is inside her that makes the hiccups, when
the snake starts you will hear the sound inside and the child will vomit in most of the time.
Then you will take the child to the hospital to consult, and by the time you are doing that the
snake is growing inside the child. And when she grow up and stop breastfeeding you find that
she starts to have seizure and collapse. It caused by a snake" (female, unknown age). Many
healers conveyed confidence in treating seizure disorders, particularly in children. Treatment
options included a mixture of trees given in a tea, the mixture of herbs mixed with porridge,
and mixing a patient's blood with that of a pig. Still, some healers express hesitation to treat sei-
zure disorders, as one noted when asked regarding the cause of the disorder: "I don't know. I
didn't want to treat it because I was scared of those people when they have seizure" (female, 74
years).
Each additional year of formal education received by healers was associated with lower
odds of treating seizure disorders (OR: 0.83 p = 0.017). Each additional patient a healer saw in
the previous week was associated with greater odds of treating seizure disorder (OR: 1.10
p = 0.033). Gender, type of healer, and immigration status were not associated with different
treatment practices (Table 2).
Losing touch with reality (xi-Tsonga name: Nhlanyi). Forty-seven percent of healers
believed they could successfully treat an adult who had lost touch with reality (xi-Tsonga

name: Nhlanyi) There was agreement among healers that this condition could manifest itself
differently among patients, but one healer best described the symptoms of Nhlanyi: "You will
see him/her counting numbers that doesn't exist, laughing and do[ing] things that are not nor-
mal; they differ on their illnesses. There are some those when they are mental ill they will be
running around, some will walk naked and some will always be laughing (woman, 45 years).
Healers explained the cause of the illness to be a source outside the patient: "Some you find that
they have demons and [they] are the ones that are making her to be [mentally] ill. And then if
you give her treatment for the calling, you find that she will be cured" (female, 37 years). Others
conveyed that while they are able to minimize associated behaviors and psychosis, they may
not always be able to cure the disorder: "When a person comes being mentally ill, you find that
he is running around . . . I am able to give him treatment that will help him to have less power
and he will stop fighting people. Then when I realize that I am failing to treat him, I will take him
to hospital" (male, 31 years). Herbal remidies were delivered via drops into the patient ears and
eyes to ensure the treatment directly reached the brain. Female healers demonstrated lower
odds of treating Nhlanyi than their male counterparts (OR: 0.26 p = 0.024), while those who
had emigrated from Mozambique had greater odds of treating this illness (OR: 2.86 p = 0.032).
Each additional patient a healer cared for was associated with higher odds for treating Nhlanyi
(OR: 1.17 p = 0.010). Formal education was not associated with willingness to treat Nhlanyi
(Table 3).
Paralysis on one side of the body (xi-Tsong name: Ku Oma Rihlanguti). Fifty-nine per-
cent of healers believed they could successfully treat an adult patient who had experienced a
paralyses on one side of the body (xi-Tsong: Ku Oma Rihlanguti; Table 4). None of the healer
characteristics examined were found to have a statistically significant association with differ-
ence in odds for treating paralysis symptoms (Table 5). Paralysis on one side of the body was
thought to either be caused by "a nerve that has blocked the movement of blood" (female, 54
years) or "by thinking a lot. . .the nerves on the head get tired and start to ache; you will be
affected by stress and it will be followed by Ku Oma Rihlanguti" (male 59 years). The traditional
solution was to "cut that nerve.. .. Then we are able to trick the ku oma rihlanguti not to con-
tinue and attack other nerves in the body and she will be cured on the paralyzed side." (female, 54
years). This same healer explained the challenge of working with Ku Oma Rihlanguti patients
who go to the health clinic, "they are doing physiotherapy, injecting and give them tablets but she
will never be cured. She is going to walk because they are training her but it will not be the same
as when she is at the traditional healer . . . It's about consulting early to us because if you went to
the clinic and they inject you for a long time, it is hard to treat you and get well" (female, 54
years).
Substance use. Twenty-one percent of healers believed they could treat an adult patient
with active substance abuse. Healers were hesitant to treat patients who used drugs or alcohol,

believing that the patient will continue to use drugs or alcohol regardless of the treatment pro-
vided. Female healers were less likely to treat substance abuse disorders (OR: 0.25 p = 0.012),
while each additional year of education completed was associated with lower odds of treating
substance abuse (OR: 0.81 p = 0.032). No significant association was found between a healer's
age, healer type, immigration status, or the number of patients they attended to in a week and
their odds for treating substance abuse disorders (Table 5).
Cost for treatment. According to interview responses regarding cost for services pro-
vided to adults, median reported fees charged for treating (i) substance abuse was 500 South
African Rand (~US$35), (ii) 1000 Rand (~US$70) for treating seizure disorders and paralysis
on half of the body, and (iii) 1500 Rand (~US$105) to treat patients who have lost touch with
reality. Many healers see their profession as not only important, but lucrative: "In the past there
was no money when you are a healer but nowadays it's better because there is money . . . and they
are very expensive when they charge" (female, 75 years). Another healer described an incentive
to treat patients while not charging more than necessary, "If I have treated someone, his relative
will tell other people that their patient has been cured then I will get more money after that. They
told us in our organization not to overcharge a person" (male, 78 years). Healers often recognize
the financial constraints of poorer patients, and may choose to lower fees or accept payment(s)
in-kind; as one healer noted, "Maybe you come to the healer with a blanket, they will allow it
because [our ancestors] were not after money and we are following their footsteps," and patients
may even "pay by credit until you finish your installment" (female, unknown age). Another
healer supported this notion: "This illness is very expensive because not everyone is able to treat
and cure them, I can charge R1500 but when you don't have it we don't force you to pay because
we want you to be cured" (female, 37 years). Many healers acknowledge that treating mental
disorders is challenging, and some only charge patients if and when their illness has been
cured, as one stated, "I don't charge a patient if he is not cured" (male, 31 years).
Referral to allopathic care. Some healers perceive the importance of allopathic care and
report initially referring (at least adult) patients to the clinic to be tested for HIV before they

treat them. As one explained, "We don't give treatment to the patient when she arrives but we
have to refer her to the clinic to be tested [for] everything . . . if they say [she] needs Western treat-
ment then we will not give the patient our treatments. Then we allow the hospital to do their job
and when they are done then the patient can come to us to be treated [for] illnesses that are
related to traditional" (female, unknown age). Another healer explained the difficulty that,
"According to the law from Kukula association [the local Bushbuckridge traditional healers' asso-
ciation] says we have to refer the patient to the clinic but I didn't refer anyone because I didn't
have the forms to refer the patient with" (male, 78 years). Many other healers suggested that
relying on allopathic medicine for mental illness is fruitless, as treatments from clinicians
would at best only control symptoms but never cure the disorders, which they believe could
only be achieved through traditional care.
Discussion
About half of the traditional healers in the Bushbuckridge region of South Africa were confi-
dent in their ability to treat seizure disorders, patients who had lost touch with reality, and
paralysis. Health care providers have reason to be concerned, given the potential negative
impact on the prognosis of patients who delay or interrupt allopathic services. Patients with
untreated seizure disorders risk severe brain injury [37]depression [38] and increased risk of
mortality [39,40], while often being restricted from participating in normal daily activities,
including school or employment. Given that capacity to effectively control many seizure disor-
ders exists locally at no cost (specifically treatment for epilepsy), patients seeking traditional
treatment for uncontrolled seizure disorders may be delaying effective biomedical treatment.
The provision of traditional treatment of patients who have lost touch with reality is also
concerning, as they may be suffering from psychosis, dementia, or bipolar depression. Early
identification and treatment could improve the lives of many of these patients [40] as these ill-
nesses are associated with high risk of early mortality[41­43], disability[44,45], and decreased
quality of life and depression[46,47] [48]. Finally, the delay in care seeking among people who
have experienced paralysis could result in additional risk of sensory disturbance and vertigo/
dizziness if the symptoms were caused by a stroke and increase the risk of mortality [49,50]
and reduced quality of life among survivors who do not receive effective rehabilitation[51].
Considering the low median income and the accessibility of free primary health care, the
cost of healers' traditional treatment is comparably high [52]. A recent South African study on
cost for epilepsy treatment found that compared to allopathic care, the costs for traditional
medicine was appreciably higher and varied in terms of cost by patient, with one patient
reporting to only have to pay if the epilepsy is cured [53]. Our study and other research con-
ducted in the Bushbuckridge area lead us to presume that many local patients with MNS symp-
toms do seek out, accept and pay for traditional treatments [17]. While our study did not
address the question of healer qualifications or success in reducing or eliminating patient
symptoms, a recent systematic review suggests healer treatment may improve acute relapses of
major mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but has little impact on the
long term progression of the disease [54]. In contrast, common mental disorders, including
depression, anxiety, and social difficulties seem more likely to respond to traditional treat-
ments [54].
Approximately 20% of healers reported treating substance abuse (alcohol and drugs). Given
the high prevalence of alcohol in the rural South African context [55,56], the hesitancy of heal-
ers to provide treatment for these conditions is surprising. Interestingly, there is little allo-
pathic treatment for substance abuse in rural Bushbuckridge, perhaps indicating local
perception that this behavior cannot be modified. Healers expressed the belief that patients

with substance abuse problems could only be treated if they expressed the desire stop abusing
drugs or alcohol; few community members appear to seek traditional support for substance
abuse issues.
While our study found Inyanga healers more likely to treat paralysis and substance abuse,
they have also been found to be less likely than other healers to refer patients with mental
health concerns to allopathic care [57]. A recent study among South African traditional healers
found healer attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and past referral behavior to be predictive
of healers' intention to refer mentally ill patients to allopathic care [57]. South African healers
are, in fact, already routinely and often successfully partnering with the biomedical health sys-
tem to care for patients suspected of or known to have HIV and/or TB, especially in providing
such patients referral services to clinical centers, which the government requires and healers
are extremely cautious of breaking this regulation [58]. This referral process remains informal
and unrecorded. Yet competency with and completion of the referral process remain an
important skill and behavior, and transferring this to the identification of patients with MNS
disorders is both practicable and socially acceptable [58].
While our study allows for potential extrapolation of results to the region's broader tradi-
tional practitioner population, we also recognize potential limitations of our findings. We
do not know how healer diagnoses translate to allopathic categories of disease. Healers
would often volunteer the corresponding allopathic name for the traditional illness, but
there was no way to verify that their perception was accurate. Because of this limitation we
have used illnesses descriptions or the xi-Tsonga name for illnesses described by the healers,
not the biomedical name. While our sample was a random sample of traditional healers in
the Kukula organization, we recognize that our sample may not reflect the behavior of heal-
ers outside of Bushbuckridge. Healers' memory from the previous month of the number of
patients treated, diagnoses and treatments given, payments received and treatment out-
comes may all have been affected by recall bias. Furthermore, it possible is that social desir-
ability bias influenced some healers to under report their treatment of MNS-related
disorders, if concerned about criticism from the biomedical system. Attempts were made to
reduce the potential for this bias by having the interviewer inform participating healers that
responses would not be reported to local or other government or health authorities. Finally,
this study recruited participants who were members of the Kukula association. There are
likely some traditional healers in the area who are not members of this association but we
have no data about these individuals.
Conclusion
In rural northeastern South Africa many practicing traditional healers are continuing to see
patients and offer treatments for MNS disorders and related symptoms, and often charge high
fees compared to the otherwise free or reduced costs of care at public health facilities. While
healers were able to link traditionally defined mental illness to allopathic diagnoses, about half
were confident in their ability to cure seizure disorders, patients who have lost touch with real-
ity, and paralysis on one side of the body. Given the negative long-term health implications of
delayed health seeking among people suffering with any of these conditions, there is a signifi-
cant need to better understand areas for possible collaboration in the care of patients with
MNS illnesses. Through identifying effective and affordable MNS treatments, promoting
applicable communication strategies between the systems, and supporting practitioners within
both systems to offer patients the best-suited therapies, treatment and management of MNS ill-
nesses can be vastly improved in this region, the burden of disease reduced and patients' qual-
ity of life improved.
