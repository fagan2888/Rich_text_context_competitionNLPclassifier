The world of scientific election forecasting has expanded
considerably over the last few years.1 Dominant approaches
to scientific forecasting elections privilege the role of the-
ory and lead time in predicting outcomes. Next to that
approach, there is also a stream of atheoretical efforts to
predicting election outcomes, which mainly focus on reduc-
ing the error of forecasts. This article adopts an innovative
synthetic approach to predict the outcome of elections in
Europe by combining structural predictions with informa-
tion from polls. We find that polls do not add much to the
predictive value of sound structural models of vote choice,
but that approaches which balance theory, data, and time
considerations forecast elections best.
We adopt the categorization of dominant scientific
approaches that emerged in the pivotal 2012 US presiden-
tial election, sorting forecasters according to three2 labels:
Structuralists, Aggregators, and Synthesizers (Lewis-Beck
and Stegmaier, 2014a). These approaches can be differenti-
ated by their application of theory, data, and time. The
Structuralists (Abramowitz, 2012; Campbell, 2012b;
Holbrook, 2012; Lewis-Beck and Tien, 2012) offer a theo-
retical model of the election outcome. They usually begin
with a core political economy explanation, such as vote = f
(presidential popularity, economic growth). The unit of
analysis tends to be the nation and the estimation is ordi-
nary least squares (OLS) on single equations. Furthermore,
this estimation is static, rather than dynamic, resulting in a
unique final forecast.
In contrast, the Aggregators (Blumenthal, 2014;
Traugott, 2014; Jackman, 2014), aggregate vote inten-
tions in opinion polls. A well-known example comes
from Real Clear Politics, with its voter preferences (per-
centages) combined over a number of multiple polls.
Unlike the Structuralists, the Aggregators offer no the-
ory of the vote, but the unit of analysis is still usually the
nation. Further, unlike the Structuralists, forecasting by
Aggregators is dynamic, with repeated estimates across
the campaign.
Taking a different approach, the Synthesizers (e.g.
Erikson and Wlezien, 2014; Linzer, 2013; Silver, 2012)
borrow from both the Structuralists and the Aggregators.
They start with a political economy theory of the vote, and
employ aggregated and ongoing polling preferences as
well. They analyze data either at the national level or the
state level. The analysis may include multiple equations
Forecasting elections in Europe:
Synthetic models

Abstract
Scientific work on national election forecasting has become most developed for the United States case, where three
dominant approaches can be identified: Structuralists, Aggregators, and Synthesizers. For European cases, election
forecasting models remain almost exclusively Structuralist. Here we join together structural modeling and aggregate
polling results, to form a hybrid, which we label a Synthetic Model. This model contains a political economy core, to
which poll numbers are added (to tap omitted variables). We apply this model to a sample of three Western European
countries: Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. This combinatory strategy appears to offer clear forecasting gains,
in terms of lead and accuracy.

and may be Bayesian. Forecasts are updated, with repeated
estimates across the campaign. In sum, these models join
election theory with the strengths of aggregation and
dynamic updating. Synthetic modeling will be the focus of
our European analyses here. In terms of general approach,
the Synthetic Model operates much like contemporary
weather forecasting models. The fundamental variables
governing the atmosphere (the electorate) first generate an
event forecast, say a rain storm (an election). That forecast
is subsequently checked against additional, incoming infor-
mation, as the storm pattern (or vote intentions) is tracked.
Thus, the initial forecast is updated, and modified regularly
by ever more current forecasts. The process then becomes
dynamic (on this weather analogy, see Lewis-Beck and
Stegmaier, 2014b).
Election forecasting in Europe: the
state-of-the-art
What is the state-of-the-art with respect to election fore-
casting in Europe? Structuralists dominate, as is clear from
the work of Whiteley (2005) on the UK, Nadeau et al.
(2010) on France, Norpoth and Gschwend (2010) on
Germany, Dassonneville and Hooghe (2012) on Belgium
and Magalhães et al. (2012) on Spain. These models tend to
be based on a political economic theory of voting. The
modeling is single-country, single-equation OLS work.
Estimation remains static, with one unique forecast issued.
The unit of analysis is usually, but not always, the nation.
Dubois and Fauvelle-Aymar (2004: 216) provide a typical
French example, with the unit of analysis being the region,
rather than nation:

where V = legislative vote share of parties on the left, first-
round; P = popularity of parties on the left, SOFRES polls,
three months prior to the election; E = regional unemploy-
ment rate, from the quarter before the election. (Note that
the model fits the French data about as well as it fits US
data of the same sort.)
What about Aggregators? This approach, where polls
are combined and systematically used to forecast, is almost
non-existent in Europe.3 However, using individual polls
on vote intention to forecast represents a long-standing tra-
dition, especially within the media. In the UK in particular,
there has been plentiful work in the aggregator tradition
since the 1970s.4
What about Synthesizers? We know of no examples of
Synthetic Models for a general national election in Europe.
This piece is the first attempt to build such a Synthetic
Model.
Building synthetic models to forecast
European national elections
Our aim is to combine a sound Structural Model with a
sound Aggregate Polling Model, so forming a hybrid--a
Synthetic Model--which can forecast national election
outcomes (incumbent vote share Vt
) accurately across a
sample of European democracies. Given that this is a first
effort at developing Synthetic Models for European coun-
tries, we do not wish to be exhaustive in the cases covered.
Instead, we focus on a limited number of established
democracies, with sufficient variation in electoral and party
systems. In addition, in order to develop stable and robust
forecasting models, we aim to maximize the number of
cases on which these national estimations are based. This
implies we seek out countries with extended time series
data on at least 10 general elections with sound coverage of
macro-economic and government support indicators, as
well as sufficient polling data on voting intentions. The
United Kingdom, Germany, and Ireland all met these strin-
gent data requirements and were accordingly selected for
this founding examination.
We aim to use a structural forecasting model that will be
applicable across a number of European countries, even
given all their multi-party variety. Therefore, the decision
on the forecasting target is of utmost importance. Previous
research developing election forecasting models for differ-
ent European nations indicates that accountability-mecha-
nisms are context specific. Lewis-Beck and Paldam (2000:
119) have argued that "in a multi-party system, the eco-
nomic voter may target a whole coalition, a party within the
coalition, or even assign a particular economic policy to a
particular party." Given that we seek a generally applicable
model, our preferred forecasting target is the vote of the
incumbent government--irrespective of whether this is a
single-party government, a minority coalition government
or a majority coalition government. Despite potential dif-
ferences in the extent to which coalition parties are blamed
for the economy, a number of studies forecasting multi-
party elections demonstrate an overall link between eco-
nomic conditions and the vote for the governing parties
(Aichholzer and Willmann, 2014; Bellucci, 2010;
Dassonneville and Lewis-Beck, 2014; Magalhães and
Aguiar-Conraria, 2009; Norpoth and Gschwend, 2003,
2010). We believe it is substantively interesting to forecast
the combined vote of the incumbent coalition in a multi-
party context, rather than individual parties' vote shares.
Our work echoes Norpoth and Gschwend (2003: 17), who
have referred to a simple rule from their German work: "a
governing coalition whose parties obtain a majority of seats
in an election continues in office, while a coalition that fails
in that objective is replaced by another one."
The proposed Structural Model, with its political econ-
omy core, reads Vt
= f(Economy, Government Support).
Operationally, it might read Vt
= f(GDPt-x
, Government
Lewis-Beck and Dassonneville 3
Popularityt-x
). The proposed Aggregate Polling Model pre-
dicts the incumbent vote share as a function of (aggregated)
vote intention, Vt
= f(Vote Intentiont-x
). Operationally, it
might read Vt
= f(Median Vote Intentiont-x
).5
The Synthetic Model begins with the long-term fixed
effects from electoral theory, as captured in the Structural
Model. Then, it adds to that the short-term effects induced
by other forces, as represented by the Polling Model (with
its use here of Median Vote Intention, VIt-x
.) The addition of
this variable can be justified on several grounds. First, it
represents "omitted variables" in the theoretical specifica-
tion of the vote function. This justification seems highly
plausible, given the parsimony of the structural specifica-
tion itself. Also, its inclusion can be regarded as a proxy
variable for the vote itself. To the extent that these argu-
ments are sound, we should find that VIt-x
has a significant
coefficient and reduces prediction error, improving the
forecast over time.
Thus, the Synthetic Model offers a combination of the-
ory and empirics, in dynamic form, featuring progressive
re-estimations as the election becomes closer. With refer-
ence to the 2012 US presidential election forecasting work,
it is most similar to the superlative efforts of Erikson and
Wlezien (2012, 2013). Our estimation is non-Bayesian, and
discrete, i.e. the estimates are at monthly intervals, begin-
ning at t-6 down to t-1.6
Synthetic models: the analysis strategy
in practice
We first estimate the Structural Model (at t-6) for each
European country. Then, we estimate the Aggregate Polling
Model (t-6 to t-1). Finally, we estimate a combined, single-
equation Synthetic Model (t-6 to t-1). This dynamic
assumes that while the Structural Model is fixed (at t-6), the
Aggregate Polling Model moves each month (from t-6 to
t-1). This formulation allows a new "nowcast" of the elec-
tion result with each passing month (Lewis-Beck and Tien,
2013). For our initial tests, we look at three different parlia-
mentary democracies of Western Europe: Germany (1980­
2013), Ireland (1977­2011) and the United Kingdom
(1959­2010).
We present the same basic structural forecasting model
for each of these European democracies, which implies that
we are using analogous measures for each of our cases. To
this end we rely on one macro-political indicator and one
macro-economic indicator. Following a standard approach
in the election forecasting literature, the political indicator
is a measure of government approval.7 We have chosen to
include this general government approval indicator instead
of approval of the prime minister for three main reasons.
First, our dependent variable is general, referring to the
vote of the coalition as a whole. Second, given our aim of
developing a generally applicable model for European
democracies, government approval data appears to be a
common denominator for single-party governments, coali-
tion governments and minority governments. Third, in
countries where politics is extremely personalized, we
would expect the PM's popularity to be reflected in approval
ratings of his/her government as well.8 We build in a lead
time in the structural models by including the data for gov-
ernment approval as measured six months before Election
Day. As evident from the country-specific plots in Figure 1,
there is a positive relationship between governmental
approval and incumbent vote share in each of the countries
analyzed.
As a measure of the economy in each of the democracies
analyzed, we make use of GDP growth rates (quarterly
national accounts, change compared to the same quarter of
the previous year).9 Within research on economic voting,
GDP and unemployment are considered to be "the big two"
(Lewis-Beck and Stegmaier, 2013: 376). Moreover, Kayser
and Wlezien (2011: 376) even refer to GDP growth as "the
most general objective measure of economic welfare." We
thus believe it fair to assume GDP growth serves as a good
general measure for the state of the economy in the coun-
tries under study. As with the political indicator, this eco-
nomic variable will be measured with a lead time of about
6 months. To this end, we include GDP growth rates from
two quarters before the election quarter. The bivariate
country-specific plots in Figure 2 illustrate that relationship
between GDP growth and incumbency vote share is as
expected. The better the economy is doing--and thus the
more economic growth there is--the higher the vote share
that incumbents obtain on Election Day.
Having presented our measures, in a next step, we
include the political and economic indicators in a model to
predict the incumbent vote share for each of these European
democracies.10 The structural models are estimated (OLS)
in Table 1 below. We can evaluate their forecasting perfor-
mance in terms of the following criteria: Accuracy, Lead,
Parsimony, Replication and Currency (Lewis-Beck, 2005;
Lewis-Beck and Tien, 2013). With respect to accuracy, the
R2 ranges from .58 to .87, while the RMSE ranges from 2.7
to 5.5. These numbers suggest, qualitatively, that accuracy
is "good" to "very good." With respect to lead time, it is 6
months before the election, which must be rated "excel-
lent." The model is quite parsimonious, with only two inde-
pendent variables, drawn from strong election theory.
Replication is easy enough, given the straightforward and
available measures used. With respect to currency, which
refers to how updated the forecast is, we see that it is static,
offered once 6 months out. The model appears to work best
for Germany, which yields the highest goodness-of-fit, the
lowest prediction error, and the lowest collinearity.
As a second step, we estimate a number of polling mod-
els, predicting the incumbent vote share by means of infor-
mation from the polls.11 The estimations for these polling
models appear in Table 2 below. Let us evaluate them by
the same criteria. With respect to accuracy, the R2 ranges
4 Research and Politics 
from .50 to .90 and the RMSE ranges from 2.40 to 6.00.
These numbers suggest, qualitatively, that accuracy ranges
from "fair" to "very good." Lead time now varies from a
"long distance," at 6 months, steadily down to 1 month, a
"short distance" from the election. The model is extremely
parsimonious, with only one independent variable; how-
ever, that variable is predictive rather than explanatory (i.e.
it is not based on election theory). Replication is relatively
easy, as these polling numbers are generally available. With
respect to currency, or the fact that a model is regularly
updated and hence provides news value on the "now"
(Lewis-Beck and Tien, 2013), we can say the model is
dynamic, moving from a lead of 6 months down to 1 month
before the election. A 1-month lead time appears to offer
the best accuracy, yielding a prediction error of 2.2 to 4.1
depending on the country. We cannot easily point out what
model performs best in terms of accuracy, as different indi-
cators would lead to contrasting conclusions. On the one
hand, it looks like the synthetic model predicts best in
Germany, which is the country with the highest R2 range
(.67 to .85). On the other hand, it looks like the model per-
forms best for the United Kingdom, which has the lowest
RMSE of 2.36.
The estimations for the Synthetic Models appear in
Table 3 below. Let us evaluate these models by the same
criteria (Accuracy, Lead, Parsimony, Replication and
Currency). With respect to accuracy, the R2 ranges from .64
to .98) and the RMSE ranges from 2.3 to 6.5. These num-
bers suggest, qualitatively, that accuracy ranges from
"good" to "excellent." Lead time varies from a long dis-
tance to a short distance, i.e., from 6 months before the
election to just 1 month before. The model is relatively

parsimonious, with two explanatory variables (based on
theory) and one predictor variable (a proxy based on empir-
ics, or omitted variables). The replication of the model,
with these simple available measures, poses no challenge.
With respect to currency, it is dynamic, from 6 months
down to 1 month. The model with a 1-month lead time per-
forms quite well and has a prediction error range of 2.3 to
4.4; this model performs best in the United Kingdom and
Germany, but not in Ireland. The 4-month models have a
prediction error range of 2.6­2.9. This 4-month lead works
about as well as the 1-month lead, and affords a good deal
more distance from the election target.
When we examine improvement in the model fit statis-
tics, we discover that the incremental increase in model fit
largely confines itself to the United Kingdom. There are
two potential reasons why we do not observe such a pat-
tern of gradual improvement in Ireland or Germany. First,
the polling data on which the estimations are based are
richer for the United Kingdom. Especially for the Irish
case, the limited number of available polls can render the
estimates particularly sensitive to the impact of outliers.12
Second, the United Kingdom is the country for which the
Structural Model performs worst. Consequently, the poll-
ing part--which quite logically becomes more accurate as
Election Day draws near--is the more important part in
the UK models. The improved model fit of the Polling
Model thus has a greater observable effect on the com-
bined models for the United Kingdom than it does for the
German or Irish cases.
Performing multivariate analyses on small-N samples
comes, of course, with some methodological problems,
especially as the number of independent variables increases.
As an alternative strategy, therefore, we present the results
of a second set of Synthetic Models in Table 4. These mod-
els only include two main independent variables: a struc-
tural variable and a polling predictor. We first saved the

in Table 3 and Table 4, this approach reduces collinearity in
the models slightly.
Furthermore, the y-hat approach comes with the addi-
tional advantage of allowing a more straightforward com-
parison of the explanatory power of the structural part
(government approval and GDP growth) and the polling
part (vote intentions) in the Synthetic Model. From the
results in Table 4 it is evident that in the German case, the
structural part dominates, while for both Ireland and the
United Kingdom the polling part dominates. The results for
the United Kingdom are noteworthy; over time we can
observe decreasing coefficients for the structural part and
increasing coefficients for the polling part. As such, the UK
example illustrates how the polls become a more accurate
predictor of the results as Election Day draws near.
Presumably that is because the polls come to reflect the
fundamentals13 of the Structural Model (Erikson and
Wlezien, 2012), which is also why the importance of the
structural part is reduced over time.
Comparative model evaluations
How do the three modeling approaches compare? First,
there is the basic comparison between the Structural and the
Polling Models. Taken alone, the Structural Model gener-
ally outperforms the Polling Model, i.e. better statistical fit,
less prediction error, more lead time, better explanation of
the vote. Thus, if a forecaster had to choose one of these two
strategies, the Structural Model would be preferred. This
recommendation offers comfort to those who put their faith
in theory. But the forecaster does not in fact have to choose
one of these two strategies. Instead, he or she could add the
two together, via a Synthetic Model. Is the combination of
the two strategies worth it? Yes. A synthetic approach offers
clear reduction in prediction error, and it is dynamic, allow-
ing continual nowcasting across the campaign. However,
there are tradeoffs. The error reduction from selecting the
Synthetic Model is not large, and the loss of lead time is not
small, given that the optimal model is only 1 month out. As
an important nuance, however, the data suggest that, in fact,
almost the same accuracy can be gained at 4 months out.
Predicting with a 4-month lead is therefore a marginally
sub-optimal choice that might be worth it.
Conclusions
Synthetic Models should be pursued further in the quest to
gain accuracy in forecasting national elections in Europe.
There are two primary directions for future research. First,
scholars should extend Synthetic Modeling to more
European countries. Second, scholars should extend
Synthetic Modeling to the subnational level, focusing on
lower, perhaps more politically relevant, units of analysis.
Such a subnational move would greatly increase the num-
ber of observations, which is an important consideration
since this forecasting strategy gains statistical power with a
large, independent database.
Our analyses offer a first effort at developing synthetic
forecasts for elections in European countries. The results of
these analyses indicates that when one succeeds in building
a sound Structural Model that accurately forecasts elec-
tions, polls do not add much to what we can forecast six
months out already. It seems, therefore, as if the fundamen-
tals of vote choice theories can, to a large extent, predict
elections in Europe. As an important nuance, however, the
polls do add information--perhaps campaign effects--
which these fundamentals cannot capture. This additional
information becomes all the more important as Election
Day approaches, and offers substantial insight for predict-
ing the outcome of elections where structural factors play a
smaller role in voters' choices.

Notes
1. For general reviews, see Lewis-Beck and Tien, 2011;
Stegmaier and Norpoth, 2013.
 2. The 2012 US presidential election was, in particular, subject
to an unprecedented amount of forecasting work, including,
notably, forecasts from leading political scientists (Campbell,
2012b), a post-election symposium of 16 forecasting papers
on that contest (Lewis-Beck and Stegmaier, 2014a), and a
forthcoming Special Section on forecasting US presidential
elections in the International Journal of Forecasting (Linzer
and Lewis-Beck, 2015).
3. For a useful exception, see Jennings and Wlezien (2013),
who amass over 23,000 polls from 41 countries, and then
examine how well they predict vote outcome.
 4. For a current example, see Whiteley et al. (2011).
5. The median value instead of the mean value becomes the
preferred measure of central tendency in the face of outliers,
which pervade these relatively small samples of polls, gath-
ered from a wide set of polls, from different polling houses
and with different survey strategies.
 6. For the best in Bayesian models, applied to US presidential
election forecasting, see Linzer's (2013) paper on the 2008
election, and his VOTAMATIC blog for the 2012 election
(Linzer, 2012).
 7. For Germany the data on government approval come from
the FGW Politbarometer (1977­2013). question wording
is « Sind Sie mit den Leistungen der Bundesregierung aus
xxx und xxx eher zufrieden oder eher unzufrieden ? Bitte
10 Research and Politics 
beschreiben Sie es wieder mit dem Thermometer von plus 5
bis minus 5. `Plus 5' bedeutet, dass Sie mit den Leistungen
der Regierung voll und ganz zufrieden sind. `Minus 5'
bedeutet, dass Sie miet den Leistungen der Regierung vol-
ständig unzufrieden sind. Auch hier können Sie mit den
Werten dazwischen Ihre Meinung abgestuft sagen. » and was
transformed into a 0­10 scale of government approval. For
1983 no information was available at 6 months before the
election, so approval rates from 7 months before the election
month were employed.
For Ireland government approval data are from MRBI, IMS:
1977-1997 (Irish Opinion Poll Archive, http://www.tcd.ie/
Political_Science/IOPA/index.php); 2002-2011 (Poll cover-
age in The Irish Times and the Sunday Business Times).
For the United Kingdom government approval data are:
1959­1997 Gallup Poll (Butler and Butler, 2000); 2000­2010
IPSOS Mori (www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/
researcharchive/poll).
 8. Empirically, we can point out that for the more personalized
British case, using PM approval data does result in a sta-
tistically better model fit, compared with using government
approval data. See the supplementary material (1).
9. GDP data for Germany are seasonally adjusted quarterly
national GDP accounts (change on the same quarter of the
previous year) and come from the Federal Statistical Office
Germany (1970­2013). GDP data for Ireland and the United
Kingdom are seasonally adjusted national GDP accounts
(change on the same quarter of the previous year), retrieved
from OECD.Stat.
10. Preliminary analyses in which the Structural Model does not
include a macro-political factor throw light on the need to
include such an indicator. Only relying on GDP growth rates
strongly decreases the model fit and explanatory power of
the structural models (results presented in the supplementary
materials (2)).
11. Polling data for Germany come from vote intention questions
in the Forschungsgruppe Wahlen Politbarometer (1977­
1994) and Allensbach, Emnid, Forsa, Forschungsgruppe
Wahlen, GMS, Infratest dimap and INSA polls from 1994
onwards, as available on www.wahlrecht.de. Polling data for
Ireland come from intentions for first preference in MRBI,
IMS and Red C surveys: 1977­1997 (Irish Opinion Poll
Archive, http://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/IOPA/index.
php); 2002­2011 (Poll coverage in The Irish Times and
the Sunday Business Times). Polling data for the United
Kingdom are retrieved from Mark Pack's database (www.
markpack.org.uk/opinion-polls/).
12. See supplementary material (3) for an overview of the num-
ber of polls by month and country.
13. On the one hand the "fundamentals," a term that has become
popular in media discussions about the forces driving US
presidential election results, basically refer to "fundamental"
("basic") underlying macro-economic and macro-political
forces. That is, respectively, economic performance and gov-
ernment performance, commonly measured as GDP growth
or public opinion support. On the other hand, the polls, used
in this context, commonly refer to surveys of vote intention;
rather than, for example, the fundamental of government
support (Lewis-Beck and Stegmaier, 2014a).
