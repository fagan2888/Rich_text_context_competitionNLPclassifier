Abstract
DUFFEY, KIYAH J., AND BARRY M. POPKIN. Shifts in
patterns and consumption of beverages between 1965 and
2002. Obesity. 2007;15:2739­2747.
Background: Beverage patterning may play a role in par-
tially explaining the rising rates of obesity in the United
States, yet little work on overall trends and patterns exits.
Our objective was to examine trends and patterns of bever-
age consumption among U.S. adults.
Methods: We used data from the nationally representative
Nationwide Food Consumption Surveys (1965, 1977 to
1978) and the National Health and Nutrition Surveys
(1988 to 1994, 1999 to 2002). To examine trends we
determined percent consuming and per capita and per
consumer caloric intake from all beverages. We used
cluster analysis to determine year-specific beverage pat-
terns in 1977 and 2002.
Results: The percentage of calories from beverages signif-
icantly increased between 1965 (11.8%), 1977 (14.2%),
1988 (18.5%), and 2002 (21.0%); this represents an overall
increase of 222 calories per person per day from beverages,
resulting largely from increased intake of calorically sweet-
ened beverages. Beverage patterns in 2002 were more com-
plex than in 1977 and were dominated by a greater number
of beverages, reflecting the increase in alcohol, soda, and
diet beverages.
Conclusion: Calories from beverages increased substan-
tially from 1965 to 2002, providing a considerable source of
daily calories. Given the upward trends in calorically sweet-
ened, nutrient-deficient beverages and the shifts in overall
beverage patterns, addressing beverage intake is a salient
issue for adults.

Introduction
There has been a notable increase in American's total
energy intake in recent decades observed among all races/
ethnicities, ages, and economic levels. It is estimated that
50% of the increase in daily caloric intake is coming from
consumption of calorically sweetened beverages, such as
soda (1). To date, research has focused on the rise in
calorically sweetened beverages and the decline in milk
(1­11). However, shifts in the trends and overall patterns of
beverage intake need to be more broadly examined, as these
shifts potentially contribute to the rising rates of obesity
seen in the United States (12,13).
Recent reviews put forth by the Institute of Medicine
Panel on Water and Electrolytes, the Beverage Guidance
Panel (2006), and the U.S. 2005 Dietary Guidelines panel
have noted excessive added sugar in the U.S. diet from
calorically sweetened beverages (12,14,15). This observa-
tion has led to outlining recommended beverage patterns
(12). The overarching goal of these recommendations is to
provide for adequate hydration and nutrient consumption
while keeping added calories from beverages at a minimum.
The present study adds to our current understanding of
the long-term trends in beverage consumption, including
water, by examining intake over a 35-year period and to the
larger body of literature on the topic of beverage consump-
tion by examining overall beverage patterns and comparing
these patterns over time. Pattern analysis is useful because
it provides additional information on the potential combined
effect of beverage consumption, which cannot be deter-
mined when only the consumption of individual beverages
is examined, and it allows for more specific identification of
behavior patterns for targeted interventions. Pattern analysis
is increasingly utilized in research on the effects of multi-
dimensional exposures on health outcomes.

Research Methods and Procedures
Participants and Data Source
This study used data on adults 19 years and older from 4
nationally representative surveys of food intake in the U.S.
population: United States Department of Agriculture Na-
tional Food Consumption Surveys (NFCS)1 of 1965 (NFCS
65, n  6360) and 1977 to 1978 (NFCS 77, n  17,096) and
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANES) 1988 to 1994 (III), n  13,629) and 1999 to
2002 (NHANES 02, n  9491), which contained stratified
area probability samples of non-institutionalized U.S.
households. Each survey was designed to be nationally
representative. Detailed information about each survey and
its sampling design has been published previously (16­19).
Dietary Intake
NCFS 65 and NCFS 77. Information on dietary intake
was collected over 3 consecutive days using a single inter-
viewer-administered 24-hour recall followed by a self-ad-
ministered 2-day diet record. Information on all foods and
beverages consumed both at and away from home was
recorded; 3-day values were averaged.
NHANES III and NHANES 02. For these examinations, a
single 24-hour dietary recall was administered by trained
dietary interviewers. Respondents reported all foods and
beverages consumed (plain drinking water collected sepa-
rately for NHANES III) for the previous 24-hour time
period. For NHANES III, a 4-step automated coding and
collection system known as the NHANES III Dietary Data
Collection System was used to collect all dietary recall data.
For the NHANES 02 survey, the United States Department
of Agriculture's automated multiple pass method, a 5-step
computerized dietary recall instrument, was used for data
collection.
Beverage Groups
Sixteen beverage variables were used in our analyses:
water, unsweetened coffee and unsweetened tea (do not
contain cream or sugar), low-fat milk (1.5%, 1%, and skim),
non-calorically sweetened beverages (diet sodas or other
"diet" beverages), fruit juice (100% fruit juice), vegetable
juice (100% juice), sports drinks, whole fat milk (2%),
alcohol (beer, wine, and liquor), soda (calorically sweetened
soda only), fruit drinks (beverages containing 100% juice,
or with added sweeteners), sweetened coffee, sweetened tea
(contain cream and/or sugar), other sweetened beverages
(e.g., horchata, a sweetened rice beverage, and coconut
milk), and other beverages (e.g., protein-rich meal replace-
ment drinks and instant breakfast shakes).
These beverages were grouped in accordance with the
recent beverage guidance system (12), which combined
beverages according to 1) their energy and nutrient density,
2) contribution to total energy intake and body weight, 3)
contribution to the daily intake of essential nutrients, 4)
evidence for beneficial health effects, and 5) evidence for
adverse health effects. For example, unsweetened coffee
and tea were combined into a single category. This grouping
resulted in 6 broad beverage groups, hereafter referred to as
Beverage Levels, including water (Level 1), unsweetened
coffee and tea (Level 2), low-fat milk (Level 3), non-
calorically sweetened (diet) beverages (Level 4), caloric
beverages containing nutrients (Level 5), and calorically
sweetened beverages (Level 6). These categories are similar
to those reported elsewhere (2,20,21).
Statistical Analyses
Trends. Trends are presented as calories per capita per
day, percent consuming, and calories per consumer. We
used survey commands to account for survey design,
weighting, and clustering (Stata 9.2; StataCorp., College
Station, TX). All values were adjusted to the 1965 age and
gender distribution and are reported as mean (percent) plus
standard error. Change in the percent consuming and aver-
age caloric intake among consumers was calculated by
differencing 2002 and 1965 values (rounded to the nearest
whole percent/calorie). To test for statistical differences
between years, we used independent 2-sample t tests, with
p  0.01 set for statistical significance.
Patterns. We elected to compare beverage patterns be-
tween 1977 and 2002 because 1) data were collected only in
the spring of 1965, and there were concerns about the effect
of seasonality on beverage consumption; and 2) data in
NFCS 65 lacked demographic information at the level of the
individual, precluding comparison across important sub-
groups of the population.
To generate descriptive patterns of overall beverage con-
sumption, we used non-hierarchical cluster analysis. Cluster
analysis uses available data, rather than a priori defined
patterns, to create groups of individuals with similar pat-
terns, in this case, similar patterns of beverage consumption
in 1977 and in 2002. This method has been described in
detail elsewhere (21) and has been used in previous studies
of dietary and beverage patterns (20,22­24). At each year,
beverage variables were dichotomized due to the large
number of non-consumers. However, due to large variation
in coffee in 1977 and soda in 2002, these two beverages
were categorized into a 3-level variable, providing a more
accurate representation of consumption. In 1977, individu-
als were identified as being non-consumers, medium coffee
consumers [22 fl oz (median amount reported by consum-
ers)], or high coffee consumers (22 fl oz). Similarly, in
2002, individuals were classified as being non-consumers,
medium soda consumers [19 fl oz (median amount re-
ported by consumers)] or high soda consumers (19 fl oz).

Clustering was performed on an unweighted sample. We
tested a range of 3 to 8 cluster solutions (i.e., patterns of
beverage consumption) and clustered on the following bev-
erage variables: unsweetened coffee, unsweetened tea, low-
fat milk, diet beverages, whole fat milk, fruit and vegetable
juice (combined), alcohol, and soda and fruit drinks (com-
bined). Water and sports drinks were not used because
information on intake was not collected in 1977. The most
robust and parsimonious cluster solution (containing no less
than 5% of the sample in each cluster) was selected as the
final solution.
These clusters, which represent overall patterns, or com-
binations, of beverage intake, were named according to 1)
the beverages that dominated each pattern and 2) the bev-
erages that helped differentiate one pattern from another. In
one 1977 cluster, for example, 100% of the persons con-
sumed whole fat milk, 24% consumed fruit or vegetable
juice, and fewer than 10% of the persons reported consum-
ing any of the other beverages. Since the other clusters had
between 30% and 36% of the persons within them consum-
ing fruit and vegetable juice, this variable did not help
differentiate between patterns. Thus, this particular cluster
was named whole fat milk. Age, race, and gender probabil-
ities were calculated using Stata.
Results
Beverage Trends
From 1965 and 2002, there was a significant, monotonic
increase in the per capita total caloric intake from beverages
(Table 1), increasing from 236 calories per day in 1965 to
458 calories per day in 2002 (p  0.01). Despite increases
in total calories over this same time period (1993 vs. 2185
total calories per day in 1965 and 2002, respectively, p 
0.01), the contribution of beverages to overall caloric intake
increased as well. In 1965, beverages accounted for roughly
12% of total calories. This increased to 14% in 1977 and
19% in 1989, and by 2002, beverages accounted for 21% of
daily caloric intake (p  0.01 comparing each year to each
other year). The proportion of calories from beverages has
also shifted over time. In 1965, just 17% of the population
consumed 25% of their daily calories from beverages. By
1989, a full 37% of the population was consuming a quarter
of their calories from beverages, with a slight drop in 2002
to 30%.
The changes in the per capita consumption of individual
beverages are complex. Soda, fruit drinks, sweetened cof-
fee, and sweetened tea were the only beverages for which
there was a monotonic increase in caloric intake between
1965 and 2002 (Table 1). Beverages with the largest change
in calorie consumption between 1965 and 2002 were soda
(108 calories per day, p  0.01), alcohol (73 calories, p 
0.01), whole fat milk (51 calories, p  0.01), fruit drinks
(25 calories, p  0.01), and low-fat milk and fruit juice (19
calories each, p  0.01). Overall, per capita consumption of
caloric beverage containing nutrients increased by 45 calo-
ries, due to significant increases in alcohol, and all calori-
cally sweetened beverages (soda, fruit drinks, sweetened
tea, sweetened coffee, and other sweetened beverages) in-
creased by 153 calories (p  0.01).
Many of these beverages also experienced the greatest
change in the percent of the population consuming them
(Table 2). Coffee experienced the greatest decline in con-
sumption, with roughly 30% fewer people consuming it in
2002 compared with 1965 (p  0.01), followed by whole-
fat milk (15%, p  0.01). Roughly 20% more people
reported consuming soda (p  0.01), 13% more reported
consuming alcohol (p  0.01), and 14% more people re-
ported consuming diet beverages and low-fat milk (p 
0.01) between the same time-points.
Among consumers, only whole-fat milk contributed
fewer overall calories to daily intake, although the absolute
amount between 1965 (184 calories) and 2002 (175 calo-
ries) was not significant (Table 2). Fruit drinks (199 calo-
ries, p  0.01), alcohol (109 calories, p  0.01), and soda
(129 calories, p  0.01) contributed significantly more
calories in 2002 than in 1965. Per capita water (Beverage
Level 1) consumption increased little between 1989 (43 fl
oz) and 2002 (45 fl oz), although the average per capita
ounces of all beverages consumed increased from 79 fluid
ounces in 1989 to 100 fluid ounces in 2002 (Figure 1).
Beverage Patterning
Using cluster analysis, we identified 5 robust beverage
patterns in 1977 and 5 in 2002 (Figure 2); each of these
patterns was consistently observed across multiple iterations
of analyses. In 1977, the 5 beverage patterns were named: 1)
soda, high coffee, and whole-fat milk; 2) soda and whole-fat
milk; 3) tea and low-fat milk; 4) whole-fat milk; and 5) high
coffee. These patterns differed in both the types and com-
binations of beverages from those that were observed to
group together in 2002. Beverage patterns in 2002 were
named: 1) juices and tea; 2) coffee, milk, and alcohol; 3)
medium soda, coffee, and whole-fat milk; 4) high coffee;
and 5) diet beverages and low-fat milk.
In general, beverage patterns in 2002 were more com-
plex, with a greater number of beverages represented both
between and within the observed patterns. For example,
combinations of 8 beverages dominated patterns in 2002,
while just 5 beverages dominated the patterns in 1977. The
per capita increases in consumption of certain beverages,
namely, soda and diet beverages, is reflected in the 2002
patterns, as these beverages differentiated patterns in 2002
but not in 1977. For example, in 2002, unlike 1977, con-
sumers of diet beverages fell into their own pattern.
Discussion
Overall beverage consumption has changed greatly in the
past 40 years. While most of the focus previously has been

on soft drinks (6­8,11,25), this study adds to the current
body of literature on beverage consumption by demonstrat-
ing an important role of other beverages, such as alcohol
and other types of calorically sweetened beverages, on daily
caloric intake. We further add to the literature by comparing
the distribution of beverage patterns in the population over
time. We report that beverages are now contributing a greater
number of total calories to daily intake and represent a larger
proportion of daily caloric intake than at any other time in the
past, with average Americans consuming 21% of their calories
from beverages and nearly 30% consuming a quarter or more
of their daily calories in the form of beverages.

The trends in consumption and caloric contribution of
beverages are complex. Although significantly fewer people
consumed whole-fat milk, among consumers, there was no
change in caloric intake from this beverage. With fruit
drinks, there was not a significant increase in the percent
consuming, but there was a significant increase in the ca-
loric intake from this beverage. For soda and alcohol, not
only was there a significant increase in the percent of people
consuming these beverages, but those who were consuming
obtained significantly more calories from these 2 beverages
between 1965 and 2002. Furthermore, on average, there was
a greater volume of beverages being consumed, with the
greatest increase accounted for by calorically sweetened
beverages, alcohol, and unsweetened coffee and tea.
Although caffeine is a mild diuretic, the increases in
coffee and tea consumption are likely not great enough to

containing nutrients (fruit juice, vegetable juice, whole-fat milk, sports drinks, and alcohol); Level 6, caloric beverages not containing

result in significant increases in health risk. Many human
studies indicate that caffeine consumption of up to
roughly 500 mg/d does not lead to dehydration or chronic
water imbalance (26,27) and that moderate caffeine in-
take (up to 400 mg/d) is not associated with increased
risk of hypertension, heart disease, osteoporosis, or high
cholesterol (28). The average amount of coffee and tea
reported is equivalent to roughly 236 mg caffeine/d, well
below the recommended 400 mg/d level. However, recent
increases in the availability of highly caffeinated energy
drinks, such as Red Bull (not measured in these data), and
the combined effect of consuming an overall beverage
pattern dominated by coffee and soda may mean that
individuals are reaching these upper limits. As the con-
sumption of these highly caffeinated beverages becomes
more prevalent, effects on caffeine intake specifically
may be warranted.
The differences in beverage patterns observed between
1977 and 2002 provide additional insight into how con-
sumption has changed. Generally, the patterns in 2002 were
dominated by a greater number of beverages, and patterns
emerged that were dominated by beverages that did not
dominate patterns in 1977, for example, diet beverages.
Overall, similar beverages tended to cluster together at each
time-point. For example, in 1977 and 2002, there were
groups comprised of higher caloric beverages (soda, whole-
fat milk, and alcohol) and some patterns comprised of lower
or non-caloric beverages (low-fat milk and tea).
What we found, however, is that the patterns dominated
by soda were less frequently observed in 1977 than they
were in 2002. Furthermore, a larger proportion of the pop-
ulation in 1977 consumed beverages in patterns dominated
by whole-fat milk and coffee, beverages that did not appear
in patterns of beverage consumption in 2002. These patterns
represent important differences in consumption behavior
across time and suggest that the potential combined caloric
intake from beverages is considerably larger among some
individuals compared with others, depending on the com-
bination of beverages being consumed. Finally, understand-
ing patterns of consumption allows for more targeted inter-
ventions aimed at changing broader behaviors, rather than
relying on narrowly focused intervention messages (29­
32), and patterns have served as important tools in health
outcomes research.
Interpretation of these results should be viewed cau-
tiously, as methods for collecting dietary intake information
changed over the course of the 4 surveys. Most notable is
the adoption of the 4-step multiple-pass method for collect-
ing 24-hour dietary recall in NHANES III and the 5-step
multiple pass method implemented in NHANES 02. The
National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, responsible for conducting
the NHANES studies, did not conduct bridging studies to
determine if systematic changes in reporting occurred as a
result of these methodological changes; thus, possible con-
founding of time and methodological effects remains. One
might speculate that more accurate reporting of beverages
as a result of changes to intake methods would artificially
inflate intake estimates; however, bridging studies between
the 1970s and 1980s found that shifts in total energy and
food composition estimates resulting from changes in meth-
odologies did not significantly impact results (33,34). Ad-
ditional limitations include the fact that dietary intake in-
formation was collected over just one season in 1965. In
addition, the potential exists for systematic under-reporting
by BMI category. Specifically, it has been demonstrated
that overweight individuals tend to under-report dietary
intake (35­38), which may result in an underestimation of
beverage consumption. Given the increasing prevalence of
overweight and obesity over time, the magnitude of under-
reporting may have also increased, resulting in an underes-
timation of the upward trends in beverage consumption.
Finally, due to recent changes in the availability of certain
drinks, specifically caffeinated waters and other caffeinated
beverages, we cannot adequately address the effects of
changes in consumption of these beverages in the American
diet.
Although the mechanisms have not been elucidated, ev-
idence suggests that individuals' compensation for liquid
calories is different from compensation for calories from
solid foods (39,40). Mattes reported a complete lack of
compensation for fluid intake, suggesting that these calories
are not readily "registered" for appetite regulation (41).
Furthermore, in a 4-week crossover study comparing inges-
tion of 450 kcal of calorically sweetened fruit drink vs. solid
sweetened food (jelly beans), there was a significant in-
crease in body weight during the fluid consumption that was
not observed for the solid food (42).
Delineating the role that beverages play in a healthy diet
may be a valuable piece of the public health message aimed
at stemming obesity rates. Toward this end, the present
study improves our understanding of the contribution of
beverages to overall caloric intake and the dynamic inter-
actions of beverages as overall patterns of consumption. For
the average American, beverages represent a significant
source of excess calories providing, for the most part, little
added nutritional benefit above what would be obtained by
consuming whole foods. To clarify, although consumption
of fruit juice provides essential vitamins and nutrients, the
added calories and weaker compensatory response elicited
by beverages make consumption of fruit juice less desirable
than consumption of the fruit itself. The exception may be
the consumption of low-fat milk, which may confer health
benefits (43­45), especially to certain populations, when it
replaces other beverages (46,47), although the evidence is
not conclusive (48). While children are mostly targeted for
policies regarding access to various beverages, the present
study shows that this is also a salient issue for adults.
