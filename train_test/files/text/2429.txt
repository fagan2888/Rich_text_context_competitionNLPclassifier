General strain theory suggests that negative emotions are the key mediating variable between strain
and crime. Researchers have found that the relationship between strain and emotions sometimes
differ by sex. We argue that gender identity, or how masculine or feminine individuals view
themselves, offer an additional explanation of emotional reactions to strain rather than focusing
on sex differences alone. Using a subsample of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (Add Health), we examine the direct effects of gender identity on negative emotions and
the conditioning effects of masculinity and femininity on the relationship between strain and nega-
tive emotions. Our results indicate that gender identity is important for explaining the effect of strain
on anger for males and females. Gender identity plays less of a role in explaining depression,
however. These findings support the inclusion of gender identity when explaining gender differences
in a general strain theory context.
A consistent finding in criminology is that males offend more frequently and commit more
serious offenses than females (Steffensmeier et al. 2005). One prominent theory that is well sui-
ted to explain the gender gap in offending is general strain theory (GST). The core idea of GST
is that when people experience strain, they then experience negative emotions such as anger and
depression that may be alleviated through legitimate or illegitimate coping techniques depending
on characteristics of the individual and the environment (Agnew 2006).
Gender differences in emotional reactions to strain may thus be a key explanation as to why
males offend more frequently than females (Broidy and Agnew 1997). Anger has been found to
be the salient emotion in explaining criminal behavior (Baron 2007; Piquero and Sealock 2004)
while the effect of depression on crime is inconsistent (Broidy 2001; De Coster and Zito 2010;
Piquero and Sealock 2004). Presumably, anger motivates actors to respond to strain aggressively
while depression encourages withdrawing, escapist, and=or self-destructive behaviors (Agnew
1992; Drapela 2006; Hay, Meldrum, and Mann 2010; Jennings et al. 2009; Jang and Johnson
2005; Manasse and Ganem 2009; Sigfusdottir, Farkas, and Silver 2008). If, as a result of strain,
males are more likely to experience outer-directed emotions such as anger while females
experience high levels of both anger and inner-directed emotions such as depression, then gender
differences in crime and deviant behavior may be explained through gender differences in the

experience of emotions. However, the research is mixed with some studies finding that males
and females respond to strain with similar emotions (Jennings et al. 2009; Kaufman 2009;
Kort-Butler 2009; Piquero and Sealock 2004; Piquero et al. 2010; Sigfusdottir and Silver
2009; Sigfusdottir et al. 2004; Sigfusdottir et al. 2008) while other studies do find either
expected gender differences in the experience of emotions or mixed support (Broidy 2001;
De Coster and Zito 2010; Drapela 2006; Hay 2003; Jang and Johnson 2005; Piquero and
Sealock 2004).
Explaining why some studies find sex similarities in emotional reactions to strain while others
find sex differences may be crucial to explaining why males offend more frequently than
females. We seek to explain these mixed findings by examining how gender identity (i.e.,
how masculine or feminine individuals view themselves) affects emotional reactions to strain.
Most gender and GST studies examine differences in strain, emotions, and criminal behavior
by comparing separate models by sex. However, these studies do not take into account the
degree to which males and females identify with feminine and masculine traits but rather assume
that gender socialization affects individuals similarly (De Coster and Zito 2010; Hay 2003).
While femininity and masculinity may be correlated with biological sex due to gender based
socialization, some individuals may identify with both masculine and feminine characteristics,
while others may identify only with traits of the opposite sex (Horwitz and White 1987). We
assert that gender identity will affect emotional reactions to strain and these effects will be
similar for males and females.
Specifically, we argue that those who identify with a masculine gender identity should be
more likely to experience anger as a result of strain while those who identify with a feminine
gender identity should be more likely to experience depression as a result of strain. It is impor-
tant to examine how gender identity affects reactions to strain rather than assuming that males
internalize only masculine characteristics while females internalize only feminine characteristics.
By examining how masculinity and femininity moderate the effect of strain on negative
emotions, we hope to shed light on the mixed findings in previous GST and gender studies.
To examine these arguments, we use a subsample from Waves III and IV of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).
GENERAL STRAIN THEORY
According to general strain theory (GST), people are pressured into crime through strain or
``. . . events or conditions that are disliked by individuals'' (Agnew 2006:4). Strains include
those that hinder goal achievement, result in the loss of something positively valued, and those
that include negative treatment by others (Agnew 1992). Failure to achieve positively valued
goals may include having less money, status, or autonomy than is desired. The loss of something
valued may include property or money that is stolen, death of someone close to the individual, or
a breakup of a romantic relationship. Finally, negative treatment by others may include victimi-
zation; negative relationships with parents, teachers, and friends; and other stressful life events
(Agnew 2006).
Agnew (1992, 2006) asserts that strain produces negative emotions such as anger and
depression and these emotions create pressure in the individual that needs to be alleviated.
The negative emotions that follow strain have a mediating effect which increases the likelihood
180 S. KEITH ET AL.
of deviance or criminal behavior (Hay 2003; Sigfusdottir et al. 2004; Matud 2004). Anger is
more salient for crime than other negative emotions because it motivates individuals to take
action, increases the justifications for crime, instigates a desire for revenge, and inhibits rational
thought (Agnew 1992, 2006). Anger, an outer-directed emotion, has been found to be related to
aggression and other outwardly-directed behaviors, while inner-directed emotions such as
depression have a stronger effect on withdrawing behaviors (Ganem 2010; Jang and Johnson
2005; Piquero and Sealock 2004; Sigfusdottir et al. 2008). Finally, Agnew (2006) notes that
not everyone will respond to strain with negative emotions and=or crime. Most people find
noncriminal ways to cope with strain depending on a variety of characteristics of individuals
and the environment such as their coping skills, social support networks, level of conventional
bonds, criminal behavior of peers, and the benefits and ease of committing crime (Agnew 2006).
We argue that gender identity is a neglected conditioning variable that may also explain how
individuals react to strain.
GENDER AND GENERAL STRAIN THEORY
Broidy and Agnew (1997) provide the foundation for explaining the gender gap in offending
from a GST framework. First, they suggest that one might think that males are subject to more
strain although they point out that the stress literature does not support this proposition. In
addition, recent studies confirm that females experience as much or more strain than males
(Baron 2007; Matud 2004; Moksnes et al. 2010; Piquero et al. 2010; Sigfusdottir and Silver
2009). Rather, the gender gap in offending may better be explained by differences in the types
of strain and susceptibility to these strains with males experiencing more crime producing strain
such as financial strain, peer problems, and criminal victimization and females experiencing
more relationship-based strain (Broidy and Agnew 1997; Cheung and Cheung 2010; De Coster
2005; Hankin and Abramson 2001; Hay 2003; Jang 2007; Jennings et al. 2009; Kaufman 2009;
Kort-Butler 2009; Liu and Kaplan 2004; Matud 2004; Sigfusdottir and Silver 2009).
Relationship-based strain such as caring for family increase attachment to conventional others
and reduce the opportunities and benefits for females to commit crime, while concerns over
material success and victimization may increase the desire and opportunity for criminal coping
among males. Not all studies find gender differences in strain, however, with some studies
finding that males and females experience similar strains reacting in similar ways (Baron
2007; De Coster and Zito 2010; Hay et al. 2010; Hoffmann and Su 1997; Jennings et al.
2009; Kaufman 2009; Kort-Butler 2009; Liu and Kaplan 2004; Piquero et al. 2010). In sum,
numerous studies suggest that males and females experience different types of strain with males
experiencing strain more likely to lead to crime with some exceptions.
Because differences in the type of strain alone cannot fully explain the gender gap in offend-
ing, Broidy and Agnew (1997) suggest that general strain theorists might argue that differences
in emotional responses to strain affect offending. Specifically, males may be more likely to
offend because they become angrier as a result of strain while females experience more
depression. However, Broidy and Agnew (1997) and others challenge this line of thought
finding that females are just as angry as males if not more angry (Mirowsky and Ross 2003).
Some evidence suggests males experience anger uniquely based on their gender such that
when males are angry they blame others and worry less about hurting others' feelings and thus
GENDER IDENTITY AND EMOTIONS 181
use anger to demonstrate their masculinity (Broidy and Agnew 1997; Campbell 1993). Females,
on the other hand, may experience crime-suppressing emotions such as depression and guilt in
conjunction with anger (Campbell 1993; De Coster and Zito 2010; Hankin and Abramson 2001;
Hay 2003; Jang 2007; Mirowsky and Ross 1995, 2003; Simon and Nath 2004). Because girls
blame themselves and feel expressing their anger is inappropriate, they should be less likely
to act out their feelings, thus coping with these negative emotions in more self-destructive ways
such as eating disorders (Sharp, Brewster, and Love 2005).
As expected, many studies find that strain leads to anger for both males and females (Hay
2003; Jang and Johnson 2005; Jennings et al. 2009; Kaufman 2009; Moksnes et al. 2010;
Piquero and Sealock 2004; Sharp et al. 2005; Sigfusdottir and Silver 2009; Sigfusdottir et al.
2004; Sigfusdottir et al. 2008). Some studies find that anger reactions to strain vary by sex
but no clear patterns emerge as to which types of strain are more likely to affect anger for males
versus females (Jennings et al. 2009; Sigfusdottir and Silver 2009; Sigfusdottir et al. 2004). In
addition, the relationship between strain and depression is less clear with many studies finding
sex similarities rather than differences (Jang and Johnson 2005; Kaufman 2009; Moksnes et al.
2010; Piquero et al. 2010; Sigfusdottir and Silver 2009) or finding that depression is more likely
for males (Piquero and Sealock 2004; Sharp et al. 2005). However, some studies find that as
expected females are more vulnerable to depression than males (De Coster 2005; Drapela
2006; Kort-Butler 2009; Jang 2007; Jennings et al. 2009; Sigfusdottir et al. 2004; Sigfusdottir
et al. 2008). Finally, some studies confirm that females experience outer-directed and
inner-directed emotions simultaneously (De Coster and Zito 2010; Hay 2003) although not all
studies find sex differences in the co-occurrence of emotions (Sigfusdottir and Silver 2009).
In sum, the literature shows that females are just as likely to experience anger as a result of
strain although some studies find that this relationship depends on the type of strain. The evi-
dence is less clear for sex differences in internalizing emotional reactions to strain and the
co-occurrence of emotions. Therefore, it is important to examine factors that affect emotional
reactions to strain beyond biological sex differences to explain these mixed findings. This study
hopes to fill the gap in the literature through examining how gender identity affects the relation-
ship between strain and negative emotions.
Finally, Broidy and Agnew (1997) argue that the gender gap in offending may be explained
by differences in key conditioning variables that affect how males and females respond to strain
and=or negative emotions. Specifically, while males and females may experience similar types
of strain and=or negative emotions, factors such as coping resources, peers, and dispositions
towards crime may influence how individuals cope with strain and negative emotions. Some
evidence supports that females benefit more from coping resources than males (Cheung and
Cheung 2010; Jang 2007; Jang and Johnson 2005; Jennings et al. 2009; Robbers 2004).
In contrast, the relationship between strain and crime has been found to be stronger for males
who have deviant attitudes, low self-esteem, deviant peers, and attribute strain to causes outside
of their control (Baron 2007). When females have deviant attitudes and peers, they are also more
susceptible to criminal coping as a result of strain (Baron 2007). In addition, Kort-Butler (2009)
finds mixed support for gender differences in coping with most of her findings supporting
gender similarities.
To summarize, Broidy and Agnew (1997) provide a strong foundation for explaining the
gender gap in offending from a general strain theory framework. While some support has been
found for gender differences in strain and negative emotions, many studies find that males and
182 S. KEITH ET AL.
females experience similar types of strains and that the relationship between strain and negative
emotions operates similarly for males and females. Differences in coping resources provide one
area that may explain how males and females can experience similar strain but differ in emotion-
al responses. Broidy and Agnew (1997) suggest that one crucial conditioning variable that may
explain differences in negative emotions is gender socialization or gender identity. Below we
describe how this key neglected moderating variable may explain these mixed findings.
GENDER IDENTITY AND NEGATIVE EMOTIONS
Most studies that focus on sex differences in negative emotions and=or crime assume that gender
socialization accounts for differences in reactions to strain but data limitations preclude
including this measure (De Coster 2005; De Coster and Zito 2010; Hay 2003). This study adds
to the literature by including a measure of gender identity that ``refers to how individuals relate
to masculine and feminine qualities'' (Horwitz and White 1987:159). Gender identity is
developed through socialization where children at a young age are taught appropriate gender
roles and what it means to be a male or female (Bem 1981; Broderick and Korteland 2002).
Males are typically socialized to embody masculine traits such as being assertive, independent,
competitive, and physically and emotionally strong. Females, on the other hand, are socialized to
be warm, nurturing, and compassionate (Horwitz and White 1987). Gender identity is typically
measured through respondents indicating whether they view certain traits as describing them-
selves (Bem 1974). The Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) was developed to capture the two
facets of gender identity and remains a commonly used scale in sociology and psychology to
assess levels of emotions (Kinney, Smith, and Donzella 2001; Kogut, Langley, and O'Neal
1992; Kopper and Epperson 1991, 1996; Nofziger 2010; Priess, Lindberg, and Hyde 2009; Stop-
pard and Paisley 1987), although only one study focused on general strain theory (Ganem 2010).
Masculine qualities are more compatible with anger and criminal behavior while feminine
characteristics such as being compassionate, passive, dependent, and emotionally and physically
weak align more with inner-directed emotions and behaviors such as depression and
self-destructive behaviors (De Coster 2005; Horwitz and White 1987; Messerschmidt 1993;
Strough et al. 2007). As reviewed above, however, males do become depressed and females
do become angry and both sexes may respond with internalizing and externalizing behavior.
Therefore, these inconclusive findings may better be explained by gender identification rather
than sex alone since some males may subscribe to feminine qualities while some females
may relate more closely with masculine qualities (Horwitz and White 1987). ``Therefore, to
the extent that gender identities are related to styles of pathology, we would expect a tendency
for males with feminine identities to develop internalized styles of distress and females with
masculine identities to engage in acting out behaviors'' (Horwitz and White 1987:159).
A number of studies examine the direct relationship between gender identity and deviance
finding evidence that masculinity increases outer-directed behaviors while femininity reduces
these factors (Heimer 1996; Heimer and De Coster 1999; Horwitz and White 1987; Nofziger
2010). Most studies that quantitatively assess the relationship between gender identity and anger
find that those who are more masculine report higher levels of anger while identification with
femininity reduces angry emotions (Kinney et al. 2001; Kogut et al. 1992; Kopper and Epperson
1991) with limited exception (Ganem 2010). It is important to note that in most cases gender
GENDER IDENTITY AND EMOTIONS 183
identity affects anger while sex is unrelated. These patterns hold regardless of how gender ident-
ity is measured. For example, some studies measured gender identity using the shortened Bem
Sex Role Inventory scale (Kinney et al. 2001; Kogut et al. 1992; Kopper and Epperson 1991,
1996; Nofziger 2010) similar to this study, while others relied on the Personal Attributes Ques-
tionnaire assessing stereotypical feminine and masculine traits (Horwitz and White 1987), and
others used a measure including stereotypical gender roles and traits (Heimer 1996; Heimer
and De Coster 1999). Given these findings, we predict a direct relationship between gender
identity and anger such that higher levels of masculinity should lead to more anger while higher
levels of femininity should lead to less anger. While biological sex may be correlated with gen-
der identity, `` . . . the content of gender role orientation, rather than the degree of congruence
between one's biological sex and gender role orientation, influences mental health'' (Barrett
and White 2002:465). Thus, we expect these relationships to hold regardless of biological
sex. We propose the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1A: Those who are higher in masculinity should be more likely to experience anger
than those who are lower in masculinity.
Hypothesis 1B: Those who are higher in femininity should be less likely to experience anger than
those who are lower in femininity.
In addition, some evidence suggests that those who are high in femininity and=or low in
masculinity are more likely to experience depression (Barrett and White 2002; Van Gundy
2002). Overall, the research shows strong support for masculinity reducing depression with these
relationships holding regardless of biological sex (Barrett and White 2002; Horwitz and White
1987; Kopper and Epperson 1996; Priess et al. 2009; Stoppard and Paisley 1987; Van Gundy
2002). The effect of femininity on depression is less consistent, however, with numerous studies
finding no relationship (Barrett and White 2002; Horwitz and White 1987; Priess et al. 2009) or
finding that higher levels of femininity decrease depressed emotions contrary to theoretical expec-
tations (Stoppard and Paisley 1987). Based on the extant literature and theoretical assumptions in
the mental health literature, we expect that higher levels of masculinity will reduce depression
while higher levels of femininity will increase this negative emotion and that this relationship
should operate similarly for males and females. Therefore, we propose the following:
Hypothesis 2A: Those who are higher in masculinity should be less likely to experience depression
than those who are lower in masculinity.
Hypothesis 2B: Those who are higher in femininity should be more likely to experience depression
than those who are lower in femininity.
While most studies show the important role that masculinity and femininity play in directly
impacting negative emotions, few studies have examined the assumption that gender identity
buffers the effect of stress on anger and depression and none within a general strain theory
framework (Barrett and White 2002; Horwitz and White 1987; Kinney et al. 2001; Kogut
et al. 1992; Kopper and Epperson 1991; Priess et al. 2009; Stoppard and Paisley 1987; Van
Gundy 2002). The underlying assumptions are that anger and depression result from stress
and, by extension, gender identity buffers the effect of stress on these outcomes. Specifically,
both masculinity and femininity may provide advantages after stressful events. Highly
masculine individuals may be less likely to become depressed after experiencing strain but these

characteristics might influence angry reactions to strain. In contrast, those who are highly femi-
nine may feel that anger is an inappropriate response to stress but may become depressed. When
the interactions are examined, the findings provide somewhat mixed support for this idea. For
example, Van Gundy (2002) does not find support that autonomy serves as a protective factor
against stressful events on depression contrary to expectations. In addition, Stoppard and Paisley
(1987) find that neither masculinity nor femininity affected the relationship between stress and
depression. Priess et al. (2009) find that masculinity reduces depression but only at lower and
medium levels of stress. In addition, Broderick and Korteland (2002) find that male and female
participants who identified themselves as more feminine rather than masculine were more likely
to report rumination or coping with problems through worrying or thinking about them. While
few studies have tested the moderating effect of gender identity on negative emotions especially
on anger, based on the mental health literature, we expect the following relationships:
Hypothesis 3A: Those who are higher in masculinity should be more likely to experience anger as a
result of strain than those who are lower in masculinity.
Hypothesis 3B: Those who are higher in femininity should be less likely to experience anger as a
result of strain than those who are lower in femininity.
Hypothesis 4A: Those who are higher in masculinity should be less likely to experience depression
as a result of strain than those who are lower in masculinity.
Hypothesis 4B: Those who are higher in femininity should be more likely to experience depression
as a result of strain than those who are lower in femininity.
DATA AND METHODS
The data analyzed for this study come from a subsample of respondents from Waves III and IV
of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Add Health is a nation-
ally representative study that consists of four waves of data collected in 1994­95, 1996,
2001­02, and 2007­08. The original respondents of Add Health consisted of more than
90,000 adolescents who were surveyed when they were in grades 7­12 during the 1994­95
school year. A smaller cohort of 20,745 adolescents completed more in-depth in-home inter-
views and were interviewed at each successive wave of data collection (Harris et al. 2003).
A unique characteristic of the third wave of Add Health is that a subsample of respondents
were asked to provide detailed information regarding their romantic relationships. One half of
the original sample was randomly selected to be considered for the ``Couple Sample.'' The final
subsample included only those remaining respondents who had been in a current relationship for
more than three months with a person of the opposite sex who was over the age of 18. This final
subsample included 4,203 of the more than 15,000 respondents who participated in Wave III.
We use the Couple Sample in our analyses because they were asked a reduced version of the
Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI), which we use to measure gender identity (described below).1
1One potential concern is that the Couple Sample differs in some important way from the full sample related to the
key independent and dependent variables. Supplemental analyses revealed no statistically significant differences between
the two samples on the dependent variables. A few differences emerged with regard to strain. In general, the Couple
Sample experienced slightly less strain with the exception of childhood victimization. Unfortunately, differences in
gender identity cannot be determined because the questions were only asked of the Couple Sample. Given that this study
focuses on a non-representative subsample, the results should be viewed as exploratory rather than being generalizable.
GENDER IDENTITY AND EMOTIONS 185
The remaining variables including our dependent, independent, and control variables come from
Wave IV.2 Approximately 87% (3,664) of the Couple Sample participated in Wave IV of Add
Heath. Our final sample included 1,461 males (40%) and 2,203 females (60%) (see Table 1 for
descriptive statistics).
Dependent Variables
Emotions
Our key dependent variables include the trait emotions of anger and depressed mood. Agnew
(1992) argues that state emotions or specific emotions that arise as a result of strain are more
important for how individuals cope with strain. Due to data limitations, we rely on trait emotions
or dispositions towards anger and depression. Trait-based emotions should affect how indivi-
duals react to strain, however, such that someone who is high in trait anger or depression should
be more likely to become angry or depressed in specific stressful situations (Hay 2003).
For our first dependent variable, anger, respondents indicated how much they agree with each
statement about them as they generally are now, not as they wish to be in the future (Harris et al.
2003). Anger was created by summing the responses to the following four statements: ``I rarely
get irritated,'' ``I keep my cool,'' ``I get angry easily,'' and ``I lose my temper.'' Responses for
the latter two items listed were reverse coded. Responses to each of these items ranged from 1
(strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree), with a higher score indicating a higher level of trait
anger (a ¼ .77).
For the second measure of emotions, we relied upon a shortened version of the Center for
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The CES-D was created to focus on
depressed moods in the general population rather than on clinical depression (Radloff 1977).
Depressed mood includes five items that measure sadness, trouble concentrating, trouble shaking
off the blues, feeling depressed, and things bothering the respondent more than usual during the
past seven days. Responses for each of the items included: never or rarely (0), sometimes (1), a
lot of the time (2), and most of the time or all of the time (3). In order to reduce skewness, we
took the natural log of respondents' summated score on this scale. A higher score on the
depression scale reflected a higher degree of depression (a ¼ .79).
Independent Variables
Strain
We examine several different types of strain because recent research indicates that males and
females are vulnerable to different kinds of stress (De Coster 2005; Kort-Butler 2009). Our first
measure of strain was included to capture subjective strain which refers to individual appraisals
2All of our measures, except for gender identity, race, and ethnicity come from Wave IV of Add Health. While we
would prefer to conduct longitudinal analyses using independent variables from Wave III predicting outcomes at Wave
IV in order to better establish causality, not all of the strain measures were available in the Wave III data. In addition, six
years elapsed between the administration of Waves III and IV which would hinder our claims of causality rather than
support them.

of events or conditions (Agnew 2006). We include four items from the Perceived Stress Scale
assessing how often in the past 30 days respondents have felt unable to control the important
things in their life, they felt confident they could handle personal problems (reverse-coded), they
felt things were going their way (reverse-coded), and they felt that difficulties were piling up so
high they could not overcome them (Cohen, Kamarck, and Mermelstein 1983). A higher score
indicated higher levels of perceived stress with 0 signifying that respondents never perceived any
of these strains in the past 30 days and 16 reflecting that all of these strains were experienced
very often in the past 30 days (a ¼ .73).
The second measure of strain, childhood history of abuse by caregivers, was constructed by
combining measures of the level of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse inflicted by parents
before the child reached their 18th birthday. Each item was coded as follows: (0) this never hap-
pened, (1) one time, (2) two times, (3) three to five times, (4) six to 10 times, and (5) more than
10 times and then summed to indicate higher levels of a history of abuse (a ¼ .53).
The third measure of strain was a composite scale intended to measure whether respondents
had been a victim of a property or violent crime in the past 12 months. One item assessed
whether respondents had something taken from them worth $50 or more while the other four
items assessed whether they had been threatened with a weapon, shot or stabbed, or physically
victimized without a weapon. The final scale ranged from 0 to 5 with 5 indicating respondents
experienced all of these victimizations in the past year (a ¼ .63).
The fourth scale was constructed to measure economic strain and assessed whether respon-
dents had difficulty paying for basic living expenses during the previous 12 months. Specifi-
cally, respondents indicated whether they were without phone service, did not pay the full
amount of the rent or mortgage, were evicted from their residence, or did not pay the full amount
of the gas, electricity, or oil bill because they did not have enough money and if they had the
service turned off by the gas or electric company, or the oil company would not deliver because
payments were not made. The summated scale ranged from 0 indicating the respondent did not
experience any of these problems in the past year to 5 indicating the respondent had all of these
financial difficulties during the past year (a ¼ .69).
For the final measure of strain, romantic strain, respondents answered a series of questions on
the quality of their current relationship or if not currently in a relationship, with their most recent
relationship. Specifically, respondents were asked to respond to how much they agree or
disagree with the following statements, ``We (enjoy=enjoyed) doing even ordinary, day-to-day
things together,'' ``I (am=was) satisfied with the way we handle our problems and disagree-
ments,'' ``I (am=was) satisfied with the way we handle family finances,'' ``My partner
(listens=listened) to me when I need someone to talk to,'' ``My partner (expresses=expressed) love
and affection to me,'' ``I (am=was) satisfied with our sex life,'' and ``I (trust=trusted) the partner to
be faithful.'' Responses were summed so that a higher score indicated they disagreed with these
statements and that they experience or experienced higher levels of romantic strain within the
relationship (a ¼ .89).
Bem Sex Role Inventory
Gender identity was measured using the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI). We include two
separate measures of gender identity, masculinity and femininity because they represent two dis-
tinct traits without the expectation that they are highly inversely correlated (Bem 1974; Strough
GENDER IDENTITY AND EMOTIONS 187
et al. 2007). We utilize the short form of the BSRI from Wave III of Add Health, which includes
10 items for the masculinity scale and 10 for the femininity scale (Campbell, Gillaspy, and
Thompson 1997). Respondents were asked to rate on a seven-point scale how often each
masculine and feminine characteristic was true for him or her. Responses to the questions range
from (1) never or almost never true to (7) always or almost always true. The masculinity scale
included the following items: ``I defend my own beliefs,'' ``I am independent,'' ``I am assert-
ive,'' ``I have a strong personality,'' ``I am forceful,'' ``I have leadership abilities,'' ``I am will-
ing to take risks,'' ``I am dominant,'' ``I am willing to take a stand,'' and ``I am aggressive''
(a ¼ .81). The femininity scale included the following items: ``I am affectionate,'' ``I am
sympathetic,'' ``I am sensitive to the needs of others,'' ``I am understanding,'' ``I am
compassionate,'' ``I am eager to soothe hurt feelings,'' ``I am warm,'' ``I am tender,'' ``I love
children,'' and ``I am gentle'' (a ¼ .91). Both scales range from 10 indicating all 10 traits were
never or almost never true for the respondent to 70 indicating the respondent reported that all 10
characteristics of that gender identity was always or almost always true for him or her.
Our measures of masculinity and femininity were taken from Wave III while most of our
independent and dependent variables were taken from Wave IV. One concern is that levels of
femininity and masculinity may change during this six-year time period. Evidence shows, however,
that masculinity and femininity are relatively stable over time (Bem 1974) although there is some
evidence that males and females become more feminine as they age (Hyde, Krajnik, and Skuldt-
Nierderberger 1991). Not all studies find that men change in masculinity over time or that females
change in femininity over time, however (Priess et al. 2009; Strough et al. 2007). In addition, levels
of masculinity and femininity may increase during adolescence (Barrett and White 2002) with the
differences reaching a peak by the end of high school (Eme 1984). In Wave III, respondents ranged
in age from 18 to 28 during a period when gender identity has started to stabilize (Barrett and White
2002). Evidence also shows that gender identity may be affected by factors such as socioeconomic
status and changes in life events such as marriage and child rearing (Kasen et al. 2006; Roberts,
Helson, and Klohnen 2002). We include these relevant controls in our analyses.
Control Variables
We include a number of control variables because they may affect the experience of negative
emotions such as demographic characteristics, experience with the criminal justice system, level
of self-control, and family life (Ganem 2010; Simon and Nath 2004). We also control for factors
that may be associated with gender identity such as socioeconomic status, marriage, and having
children so that we may take into account any spurious correlations between gender identity and
negative emotions.
Demographics
Respondents provided their race, ethnicity, and age. Race was coded as a series of dummy
variables including ``black or African American,'' ``American Indian or Native American,''
and ``Asian or Pacific Islander'' with white as the reference category.3 We include a separate
3For respondents who indicated they belonged to more than one racial category, we coded their answer to reflect the
category they felt best described their racial background (which was asked in a subsequent question).

variable indicating whether respondents reported being of Hispanic ethnicity (coded as 1 or 0
otherwise). We used respondents' birth date and the date of the interview to calculate their exact
age at the time of the Wave IV Add Health interview.
Socioeconomic Status
Socioeconomic status included three separate measures: personal yearly income, subjective
perceptions of class position, and highest level of education attained given that these measures
were not highly correlated (see Appendix A). Respondents were asked to choose a category
which best fit the total dollar amount they had earned in wages=salaries, tips, bonuses, and over-
time pay, and=or in income from self-employment in the previous fiscal year. They could choose
categories from 1 to 12 with 1 indicating a total personal income of less than $5,000 and 12
indicating an income of over $150,000. Response categories were in $5,000 increments until
$30,000 where the size of the income between categories increased. This strategy resulted in
a normally distributed personal income measure. To assess the effect of respondents' subjective
perceptions of their social class position, we also created a variable using data from a question in
which respondents were instructed to ``think of [a] ladder as representing where people stand in
the United States. At the top of the ladder (step 10) are the people who have the most money and
education, and the most respected jobs. At the bottom of the ladder (step 1) are the people who
have the least money and education, and the least respected jobs or no job'' and indicate where
they would place themselves on that ladder relative to other people in the United States. Finally,
respondents indicated their highest level of education ranging from 1 (8th grade or less) to 8
(completed a doctoral degree).4
Criminal Justice Involvement
To measure criminal justice system involvement, we created a variable that represented
whether respondents' had ever been arrested in their lifetime.
Self-Control
We created a five-item scale to measure respondents' level of self-control. For the items
on this index, respondents indicated on a scale from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly
disagree) how much they agreed with the following statements: ``I am not interested in other
people's problems,'' ``I go out of my way to avoid having to deal with problems in my life,''
``when making a decision, I go with my `gut feeling' and don't think much about the
consequences of each alternative,'' ``I like to take risks,'' and ``I live my life without much
thought for the future.'' Scores ranged from 5 to 25 with a higher number indicating higher
levels of self-control (a ¼ .55).
4The exact scale for education included 8th grade or less (1); some high school (2); high school graduate (3); some or
completed vocational or technical training (4); some college (5); completed college (6); some graduate school, completed
master's degree, some graduate training beyond master's degree, some or completed post baccalaureate professional
education, (7); doctoral degree (8).
GENDER IDENTITY AND EMOTIONS 189
Religious Involvement
We created a two-item composite scale to measure religious involvement. The first item
measures how often respondents attended religious worship services in the past year and the
second item measures how often they attended other activities at a religious institution. For both
items, responses ranged from 0 (never) to 5 (more than once a week). The scale was summed
such that a 0 indicated that respondents never attended services or other activities with 10
indicated they attended both more than once a week.
Relationship and Parental Status
We created a dummy variable that indicates if the respondent was currently in
a marriage or not (1 ¼ married; 0 ¼ not currently married). Finally, we included a variable
that indicated whether or not respondents had at least one living biological child.5 Those
who had at least one child were coded ``1'' and those who did not were coded ``0.''
Finally, we include a variable indicating whether someone has ever cohabitated coded
as ``1'' or ``0'' otherwise.
Analytical Strategy
Following the work of others examining gender differences in GST (e.g., Jang 2007;
Kaufman 2009; Piquero and Sealock 2004), we began our analyses by testing for mean
differences (or proportions if the variables were dichotomous) by gender in our primary
independent, dependent, and control variables using independent samples t-tests (see
Table 1). We then conducted a series of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models
predicting negative emotions (see Tables 2 and 3). In Tables 2 and 3, Model 1, we present
the direct effects of the strain and the control variables on negative emotions separately
for males and females. Using stepwise procedures, we added the gender identity variables
in Model 2. We relied on the procedure recommended by Paternoster et al. (1998) to test
for significant differences in regression coefficients between models. Next we examined
the effects of the two-way interactions between strain and gender identity predicting
negative emotions entering one interaction in the model at a time for males and females.
These models (not shown to conserve space) include all independent and control variables.
We present the coefficients for the interaction terms for these models in Table 4 and 5
as well as the conditional effects when the interactions were significant. In order to
examine the nature of each interaction, we assess the effect of strain on negative emotions
at different values of masculinity and femininity.6
5Unfortunately, respondents were only asked about biological children although stepchildren may be equally
important.
6When interaction terms were significant, we calculated the standard errors at each level of gender identity with the
following formula: Standard error (b1 þ b3 Â X2) ¼ ([(var(b1) ¼ [(X2)2 Â var(b3)] þ [2 Â (X2) Â cov(b1,b3)])1=2. Test
statistics are computed with the following formula: t ¼ (b1 þ b3 Â X2)=S(b1 þ b3 Â X2).

RESULTS
Descriptive Results
Results from the tests for mean differences show significant differences between males
and females with regard to negative emotions, strain, and gender identity (see Table 1). As found
in the mental health literature, females reported higher levels of anger and depression than males.
In addition, females reported higher levels of perceived stress and childhood abuse while males
reported significantly more criminal victimization than females. While females experience more
economic strain than males, the difference did not reach conventional statistical significance.
Turning to our key moderating variables, females reported significantly higher levels of

effects on anger for males only, and the z test results show that the coefficient is significantly
higher for males. Romantic strain leads to anger for females but not for males. In the second
model including the direct effects of gender identity, our results show that masculinity had a
positive effect on anger, while femininity had a negative effect on anger for both males and
females confirming Hypotheses 1A and 1B. In sum, very few sex differences exist with regard
to the effect of strain and gender identity on anger.
A few of the control variables affected anger when examining Model 2. For males, whites
were more likely to report being angry than blacks or Asians and those who were higher in self-
control reported lower levels of anger for both sexes. In addition, females who were more
involved in religious activities reported lower levels of anger. Finally, females who were
currently married and those who had at least one child reported higher levels of anger than single
or childless women. To summarize, as expected, strain leads to anger for both males and females
indicating some sex similarities although some sex differences emerged depending on the type
of strain. Gender identity operates as hypothesized with masculinity increasing anger and
femininity decreasing anger for both sexes. Gender identity appears to be especially important
for influencing anger among females given the larger increase in variance explained compared
to the model for males.
Depression. The results presented in Table 3, Model 1 indicate that perceived stress and
a history of abuse by caregivers have positive effects on depression for both males and females.
Consistent with the argument that females respond to strain with depression more so than
males, criminal victimization and romantic strain lead to higher levels of depression for females
only. Recall that perceived stress, childhood abuse, and romantic strain lead to anger among
females supporting the argument that females respond to strain with anger and depression
simultaneously.
Contrary to expectations, only femininity for females had a significant negative effect on
depression. Thus, gender identity does not affect depression for males and leads to a decrease
in depression for highly feminine females. These results counter our second hypothesis (2B),
which asserts that those who are higher in femininity will be more likely to experience
depression.
Very few control variables affected depressed moods as shown in Model 2. Males and
females who were higher in self-control were less likely to be depressed. Asian males were more
likely to report depression than white males. Females who had cohabitated were significantly
more likely to report depression than females who had not cohabitated.
In sum, sex similarities emerged in models predicting depression. Specifically, strains
increased depression for males and females although criminal victimization and romantic strain
was significant for females but not for males. In addition, gender identity plays little role
in explaining depression and contrary to expectations, higher levels of femininity was related
to lower levels of depression.
Effects of the Interactions Between Strain and Gender Identity on
Negative Emotions
To examine the potential moderating effects of gender identity, we ran separate regressions
adding interaction terms one at time which included the strain and control variables.
GENDER IDENTITY AND EMOTIONS 193
Tables 4 and 5 include the coefficients for each significant interaction term that was regressed on
anger. Depression was excluded from the tables given that none of the interactions were
significant. We also display the slopes and significance levels of the effect of strain on anger
at varying values of gender identity.
Three of the interactions were significant for males when examining how masculinity
conditions the relationship between strain and anger (see Table 4). The first significant
interaction shows that perceptions of stress have a stronger effect on anger as levels of
masculinity increase. At very low levels of masculinity perceived stress does not affect
anger. A history of abuse by caregivers demonstrates a similar pattern with the effect of
strain on anger becoming stronger as masculinity increases. The slope becomes negative
and insignificant at lower levels of masculinity indicating that history of abuse does not

affect anger when masculinity is below average levels. A similar pattern emerges for the
interaction between romantic strain and masculinity. Males who score at the lowest levels
on masculinity are significantly less likely to respond to romantic strain with anger.
Romantic strain is more likely to lead to anger for males who are high in masculinity.
In sum, as expected and in support of Hypothesis 3A, masculinity exacerbates the effects
of most types of strain on anger for males.
Limited support was found for the importance of masculinity for females with only two sig-
nificant interaction terms. Our results indicate that females are less likely respond to economic
strain with anger when masculinity is low. While the pattern of the relationship is similar for
females in that the coefficient becomes positive at higher levels of masculinity, the relationship
between economic strain and anger is no longer significant at average and above average levels
of masculinity. For romantic strain, masculinity exerts a significant positive effect on anger but
only at average and above average levels of masculinity. In summary, we find some support for
Hypothesis 3A that strain is more likely to lead to anger for those who are higher in masculinity
and these relationships are similar for males and females.
We also found that femininity conditions the relationship between some types of strain
and anger for males and females (see Table 5). For males, femininity exacerbates the effects
of romantic strain on anger, with those who are very high in femininity being more likely
to report anger as a result of this type of strain. Interestingly, those males who report low
levels of masculinity were significantly less likely to respond to romantic strain with anger.
This runs counter to our prediction that angry reactions to strain would be less likely among
males who were higher in femininity (Hypothesis 3B). Although contrary to our hypothesis,
it may be that romantic strain is perceived as more severe for men higher in femininity,
thus producing higher levels of anger. Levels of femininity did not affect the relationship
between perceived stress, childhood abuse, criminal victimization, or economic strain for
males.
The patterns that emerged for the effect of strain on anger at higher levels of femininity were
contrary to expectations for females. We expected that anger would be less likely to result
from strain when femininity was high. Two out of five interaction terms were significant
including childhood abuse and economic strain. The effect of abuse on anger was only
significant when femininity was very low and when it was very high. For those reporting
extremely low levels of femininity, strain predicted significantly lower levels of anger. At the
highest levels of femininity those who had a more feminine gender identity were more likely
to respond to this type of strain with anger than those who had a less feminine gender identity.
The effect of economic strain showed a similar pattern with those who reported lower
than average levels of femininity being less likely to respond to strain with anger. At above
average levels of femininity, economic strain did not affect anger. In sum, we find contrary support
for Hypothesis 3B for males and females.
Contrary to expectations, gender identity did not moderate the relationship between strain and
depression for males or females. In sum, gender identity has no effect on the relationship
between strain and depression failing to support Hypotheses 4A and 4B. However, for males
and females, masculinity serves to exacerbate the relationship between strain and anger
supporting Hypotheses 3A. In addition, while we expected that angry reactions to strain would
be incongruent for those high in femininity, we found that anger was more likely when
femininity was higher for males and females.

DISCUSSION
Numerous studies have examined the applicability of general strain theory in explaining the gen-
der gap in offending with mixed results. The underlying assumption of many of these studies is
that gender socialization affects emotional reactions to strain. Specifically, it is assumed that
males internalize masculine characteristics which are congruent with anger. As a result, males
are socialized to respond to strain with anger and subsequently engage in crime. Because females
are socialized to be feminine, which includes characteristics that are inconsistent with anger, then
guilt and depression should accompany anger which serves to inhibit criminal responses. The
purpose of this study was to explicitly test whether gender socialization or internalization of
masculine and feminine traits affects emotional reactions to strain.
First, we examined whether gender identity directly affects negative emotions. We find as
expected, masculinity increases the likelihood of anger while femininity decreases the likelihood
of anger for males and females and these effects were especially important for females. These
findings indicate that how individuals are socialized whether masculine or feminine may be
the key to understanding gender differences in anger. To the extent that males subscribe to mas-
culinity and females subscribe to femininity, differences in the experience of anger will emerge.
We know that anger is especially important for explaining crime (Baron 2007; Piquero and
Sealock 2004). In supplemental analyses we find that anger leads to violent crime for both males
and females lending further support to the importance of establishing the cause of angry emotions.
Future research should incorporate gender identity as an important predictor of anger rather
than assuming that males identify as masculine while females identify as feminine. While
beyond the scope of this study, future research should examine the direct relationship between
gender identity and offending. Through including this key variable, we may come one step
closer to explaining the gender gap in offending.
We find little support that gender identity plays an important role in directly affecting
depression. Contrary to expectations but consistent with some research (see Stoppard and
Paisley 1987), higher levels of femininity result in lower levels of depression among females.
These findings contradict other studies that show that the absence or presence of masculinity
is important for explaining depression (Barrett and White 2002; Horwitz and White 1987; Priess
et al. 2009). These contradictory findings may also be explained by the complex nature of femi-
ninity (Priess et al. 2009). A concern and sensitivity for others may reduce depression because
these qualities provide an avenue for social support. Future research should examine under what
conditions levels of femininity serves as a resource versus a liability.
Future research needs to also assess other factors which may affect negative emotions such as
the presence or absence of delinquent peers and social support and other coping resources. One
important avenue for future research is how gender identity attenuates the effect of biological sex
on negative emotions. In supplemental analyses, this study found that biological sex continued
to significantly impact negative emotions independently of gender identity (see Appendix B).
Females experience more anger and depression than males controlling for strain, gender identity,
and other possible correlates of negative emotions which contradicts some studies which find
that gender identity predicts emotions rather than biological sex (Kinney et al. 2001; Kopper
and Epperson 1991).
Next we examined the interactions between gender identity and strain predicting anger and
depression. We find the most support for the conditioning effect of masculinity on the relation-
198 S. KEITH ET AL.
ship between strain and anger for both males and females. Several types of strain significantly
increased the likelihood of anger but only at average levels of masculinity and above. Strain did
not lead to anger or was less likely to lead to anger for males and females at lower than average
levels of masculinity. These findings may explain why sometimes males and females respond to
anger similarly while other times sex differences emerge given that the relationship between
strain and anger clearly depends on masculinity rather than sex alone. In other words, to the
extent that females are socialized to ascribe to fewer masculine traits, the effect of strain on anger
should be weaker than for males who do identify with masculine traits.
It is unclear why masculinity does not moderate the relationship between victimization and
economic strain and anger for males and perceived stress, childhood abuse, and victimization
for females. Data limitations may explain these results given that this study relies on trait emo-
tions and strains that occurred at various times in the past. In addition, the type of emotional
reaction may depend on the type of strain. Future studies should examine the moderating
relationship between strain and gender identity and a variety of negative emotions beyond anger
and depression. It is interesting to note that economic strain did not directly affect anger for
females and romantic strain did not directly affect anger for males. Rather, the effects of these
strains on anger depend on levels of masculinity. These findings may explain why the literature
shows inconsistencies in how different types of strain differentially impact anger for males and
females.
Our findings were mostly contrary to expectations for the moderating effect of femininity on
the relationship between strain and anger for males and females. For romantic strain for males
and for childhood abuse for females the effect of strain on anger increased at higher levels of
femininity. For romantic strain for males and economic strain for females, lower levels of
femininity reduced the effect of strain on anger. These seemingly contradictory findings may
be explained by the type of strain and how these relate to gender identity. First, we find that
romantic strain leads to more anger at higher levels of femininity for males. Men who identify
with feminine characteristics may find romantic strain to be particularly severe and respond with
higher levels of anger than those who do not identify themselves as feminine. As a male, others
will view anger as an acceptable response to strain. In addition, childhood abuse may be viewed
as higher in magnitude for females. Based on Chesney-Lind's (1989) work, being victimized by
caregivers may be especially traumatic for females. It may be that more feminine women experi-
ence this strain more intensely and therefore respond with higher levels of anger. While these
strains may lead to more anger among females, gender identity may inhibit the expression
of these emotions. Finally, gender identity may shape perceptions of strain. For example, gender
identity may influence how severe or salient a strain is viewed which will then affect negative
emotions. Future research should explore how gender identity affects emotional reactions to
strains paying particular attention to the salience for masculine and feminine identities. While
beyond the scope of this study, a next step would be to then examine how the experience of these
emotions is expressed through either internalizing or externalizing behaviors.
Overall, we find no support for the conditioning effects of gender identity on depression for
males and females. It is surprising that masculinity did not reduce the effect of strain on depression
given prior research in the mental health literature demonstrating the importance of masculinity
in reducing depressive symptoms (Barrett and White 2002). Future research should explore other
factors that may reduce depression for males and females when faced with strain. In this study,
gender identification appears to be a relatively unimportant conditioning factor.
GENDER IDENTITY AND EMOTIONS 199
Future research should also examine different combinations of gender identity such as being
high in both masculinity and femininity, being low in both traits, or being high in one while low
in the other. Specifically, some research has shown that androgynous individuals or those
who are high in masculinity and femininity have different mental health outcomes from those
who are undifferentiated or low on both gender identities (Barrett and White 2002). While
supplemental analyses in this study did not reveal very many significant interactions
between masculinity, femininity, and strain, researchers should continue to examine these dif-
ferent subgroups of individuals to determine how these gender identities modify the relationship
between strain and negative emotions as well as between negative emotions and crime and
deviance.
This study is not without some limitations. First we were unable to conduct longitudinal
analyses. While we conducted our analyses on two waves of data, not all key variables were
measured at both time periods in order to allow us to predict dependent variables at the second
time period. Also, our strain measures included reference periods that varied from current feel-
ings of stress to incidents that occurred in childhood. In addition, six years elapsed between the
two waves which would weaken our arguments that strain affects negative emotions. Also, data
limitations required us to rely on trait emotions rather than state emotions. State emotions in
response to particular strains should demonstrate the strongest test of general strain theory
(Agnew 2006). The reliance on trait emotions may explain our weak findings related to
depression. In other words, feeling depressed as a result of a specific strain may be different from
ongoing depression. Future research should focus on longitudinal data collected during a
relatively short time period to fully examine how gender identity moderates the relationship
between emotional reactions and strain.
Another way this research should be expanded is to focus on the experience of emotions
rather than the expression of negative emotions. There is good reason to believe that males
and females experience similar emotions but display rules determine how they choose to cope
with these emotions (De Coster and Zito 2010; Hochschild 1979, 1983). Therefore, when males
experience anger and depression, according to expression rules surrounding masculinity, these
individuals may choose to engage in crime (De Coster and Zito 2010). Females who experience
these emotions may follow feminine defined expression rules coping with internalizing
behaviors. Therefore, future studies should examine the conditioning effect of gender identity
on behavioral outcomes such as crime, drug use, and self-destructive behaviors.
Regardless of these possible limitations, this study has taken an important step in explaining a
key part of general strain theory, emotional reactions to strain. Rather than assuming that males
and females are socialized to experience different emotions we directly test these ideas through
including a measure of gender identity. Not only does gender identity directly affect emotions
but also masculinity and femininity affect emotional reactions to strain. Future research should
build on this work including measures of gender identity when explicating the relationship
between strain, negative emotions, and crime for males and females.
