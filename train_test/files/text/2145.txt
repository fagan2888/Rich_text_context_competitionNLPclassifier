We are daily exposed to many different environmental contaminants. Mixtures of these contaminants could act together to
induce more pronounced effects than the sum of the individual contaminants. To evaluate the effects of such mixtures, it is
of importance to assess the co-variance amongst the contaminants. Thirty-seven environmental contaminants representing
different classes were measured in blood samples from 1016 individuals aged 70 years. Hierarchical cluster analysis and
principal component analysis were used to assess the co-variation among the contaminants. Within each identified cluster,
possible marker contaminants were sought for. We validated our findings using data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003--2004 study. Two large clusters could be identified, one representing low/medium
chlorinated polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (r6 chlorine atoms), as well as two pesticides and one representing medium/high
chlorinated PCBs (Z6 chlorine atoms). PCBs 118 and 153 could be used as markers for the low/medium chlorinated cluster and
PCBs 170 and 209 could be used as markers for the medium/high chlorinated cluster. This pattern was similar to data from the
NHANES study. Apart from the PCBs, little co-variation was seen among the contaminants. Thus, a large number of chemicals
have to be measured to adequately identify mixtures of environmental contaminants.

INTRODUCTION
More than 140,000 chemicals are registered in the EU.1 A great
number of these chemicals are considered environmental
contaminants as they are toxic, persist in the environment,
biomagnify through the food web, and pose a risk of causing
adverse effects in humans and animals. Some of those have been
banned for use in Europe and the USA, such as dichlorodiphenyl-
trichlorethane (DDT) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), but
DDT is still used in numerous developing countries and, owing to
its long-range transport characteristics, is still spread around the
globe. Other chemicals with proven or suspected negative health
effects are still in high-volume production, such as bisphenol A
(BPA) and phthalates. Furthermore, health problems associated
with the industrial use of some metals, including aluminum,
cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and copper, are still of
global concern.
From this perspective, it is apparent that we are exposed to a
great variety of chemical compounds in our daily lives, a fact that
has been highlighted by many authorities. A recent report from
the EU, for example, was devoted to this issue of ``mixture
toxicology'',2 in which it was pointed out that, in the experimental
setting, this type of toxicology has become more central and well-
developed over the last decade. It is now accepted that a mixture
of contaminants could induce more pronounced effects than the
sum of its individual components.3 However, very little is known
about the effects of these mixtures of compounds in humans, as
much of our knowledge is based on experimental studies of
laboratory animals. For obvious reasons, it is not possible to
expose humans to mixtures of compounds in a controlled fashion.
Thus, we have to rely mainly on measurements of circulating or
urinary levels of the compounds for an assessment of exposure.
However, only a few studies of reasonable size have determined
circulating or urinary levels of a large number of environmental
contaminants. Thus, we have only limited knowledge of how
environmental contaminants derived from different sources co-
vary. There have been some studies regarding the grouping of
PCBs4--6 and although the scope and conclusions differ slightly
among the studies, they suggest at least some co-variation among
PCBs in humans.
The investigation of the co-variation among a large number of
environmental contaminants is an important first step in the
evaluation of mixtures in humans, as if there is considerable
shared variation between the different contaminants, we only
have to measure some selected marker contaminants to assess
mixtures. If the contaminants show small intercorrelations, one
has to measure a larger number of chemicals to be able to study
the health effects of mixtures.
In the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala
Seniors (PIVUS) study,7 we focused on measurements of circulat-
ing levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) listed in the
Stockholm Convention. The POPs studied were 16 PCB congeners,
three organochlorine (OC) pesticides, one dioxin, and one
brominated flame retardant.8 The study also included 11 metals,9
4 phthalate metabolites, and BPA A measured in 1016 subjects in

a community-based setting.10 The aim of the study was twofold.
First, we evaluated the interrelationship between these contami-
nants to gain a better understanding of how these environmental
contaminants co-vary in humans, and thereby identify the number
of compounds that need to be measured to obtain the necessary
information for the study of health effects of mixtures of
environmental contaminants. The second aim was to contrast
our findings for the PCBs to the grouping suggested in the
literature. Finally, we validated our findings using data from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Study.11
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The PIVUS Study
Eligible to the study were all subjects aged 70 living in the community of
Uppsala, Sweden. The subjects were randomly chosen from the register of
community living. A total of 1016 subjects participated in the baseline
investigation, giving a participation rate of 50.1%. The subjects went
through an extensive physical examination and were subjected to blood
withdrawal. Blood samples were drawn in the morning after an overnight
fast. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Uppsala
University and all the participants gave their informed consent before the
study. More details on the cohort can be found elsewhere.7
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
Study
NHANES is an annual investigation designed to assess the health and
nutritional status in a representative sample of the US population. The
study combines questionnaires with thorough physical examinations, and
data from this study can thus be used to monitor time trends of major
diseases and risk factors. Some of the environmental contaminants
measured in our study were also measured in the NHANES study and
we used publicly available data from 2003 to 2004 survey to assess the
validity of our findings in an independent data set.11
Chemical Analysis
Metals. All 11 metal elements in this study were determined in whole
blood. The analysis was performed using inductively coupled plasma-
sector field mass spectrometry after microwave-assisted digestion with
nitric acid12 according to a method accredited for 10 of the 11 metal
elements tested, with aluminium being unaccredited. Further details can
be found elsewhere.9
BPA and Phthalates. Human serum was analyzed for levels of BPA and
ten phthalate metabolites (mono-[2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl] phthalate;
mono [2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl] phthalate; mono-[2-ethylhexyl] phthalate
(MEHP); monobenzyl phthalate; monocyclohexyl phthalate; monoethyl
phthalate (MEP); monoisobutyl phthalate (MIBP); monoisononyl phthalate;
monomethyl phthalate (MMP); and mono-n-octyl phthalate (MOP)) at ALS
Canada following the general procedures presented by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.13,14 Detectable levels were found in
almost all subjects for four phthalate metabolites, MEHP, MEP MIBP, and
MMP. Further details can be found elsewhere.10
Persistent Organic Pollutants. POP levels were analysed in stored
plasma samples.8 A total of 23 POPs were measured: 16 PCBs; five OC
pesticides: p,p0-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p0-DDE), hexachloro-
benzene (HCB), cis-chlordane, trans-chlordane and trans-nonachlor (TNC);
octachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD); and one polybrominated
diphenyl ether (BDE47). Briefly, samples were prepared using solid-phase
extraction and analysed using high resolution gas chromatography
coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Among the 23 POPs
measured, the detection rate was above 95.5% for all POPs except OCDD
(80.6%) and BDE47 (72.2%). Two OC pesticides, cis-chlordane and trans-
chlordane, with detection rates of less than 10% in the study population
were not included in the final statistical analyses. Plasma concentrations
were lipid adjusted and are expressed as ng/g lipid.
Statistical Methods
Identifying clusters of contaminants. Hierarchical cluster analysis was
used to assess possible clustering of contaminants. The cluster analysis uses
the similarities between the elements and constructs variable clusters based
on these similarities. For this analysis, we defined the similarity using
Hoeffding's D statistic,15 which allows for non-linear and non-monotonic
dependencies between the variables. The value of 30*D ranges from À0.5 to
1, with À0.5 indicating complete independence and 1 indicating complete
dependence. In the presence of a large number of ties, however, the value
could be smaller. We used complete-linkage clustering in which the distance
(1-similarity) between clusters at each stage is determined by the distance
between the two points, one from each cluster, that are farthest away from
each other. Cluster stability was assessed using multiscale, multistage
bootstrapping.16 The procedure assesses the frequency of which the
observed clustering is similar in repeated resampling, with sampling
fractions ranging from 0.5 to 1.4, from the original data. These observed
frequencies correspond to bootstrap probability values (BP) and z-scores for
the BP-values for each sampling fraction were calculated according to
z ¼ FÀ1(BP), where FÀ1( Á ) is the inverse of the standard normal distribution
function. For each cluster, a line is then fitted to the z-values by
z l

, where l denotes the sampling fraction. Asymptoti-
cally unbiased probability values (AU) were then calculated for each cluster
by AU ¼ F(Àa þ b).17 We defined a stable cluster if a cluster had an
AU40.95. We performed 10,000 bootstrap replicates for each sampling
fraction to evaluate the cluster stability. Additional analyses were done by
examining the clustering pattern by body mass index (BMI) divided into
three groups, o25 (n ¼ 342), 25--30 (n ¼ 449) and 430 (n ¼ 225).
Identifying Suitable Markers within Each Cluster/Subgroup. We used
principal component analysis (PCA) to identify possible marker contami-
nants. To render the PCA more effective, the contaminants were
transformed using a nonlinear, additive transformation.18 Briefly, each
contaminant was expanded as restricted cubic splines with five knots and
the transformation that had the highest correlation with the best linear
combination of the remaining contaminants, that is, the first canonical
variate, was used. Each cluster/subgroup was represented by the first
principal component score resulting from a PCA of the variables in each
cluster/subgroup. We then used a multiple linear regression model to
model the cluster/subgroup score, using restricted cubic splines with three
knots placed at the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles of the contaminant
distribution for each contaminant, and assessed the decrease in R2
resulting from dropping each contaminant at a time until no contaminants
remained in the model. The contaminants left in a model that had an R2 of
at least 0.95 against the cluster/subgroup summary score could then be
used as markers for the entire cluster/subgroup.
Assessing the Pattern of Missing Values. Values below the limit of
detection (LOD) were replaced by LOD/O2. The pattern of missing values
among the contaminants was assessed with hierarchical cluster analysis,
using the fraction of missing data in common between any two variables
as a similarity measure. All analyses were made using R19 version 2.10.0,
with functions from the Hmisc20 and pvclust17 packages.
Validation Using NHANES Data. To validate our findings, we used
publicly available data from the NHANES 2003--2004 study.11 We identified
corresponding contaminants and repeated our analyses using subjects
aged 70 years or older. The contaminants that were determined across the
two studies were PCBs 74, 99, 105, 118, 138, 153, 156, 157, 170, 180, 189,
194, 206, and 209, Cd, Pb, Hg, ocdd, TNC, and BDE47. The number of
individuals included in the NHANES data was 1128, although the number
of POP samples ranged from 240 to 260 and the number of metal samples
was 976. We performed additional exploratory analyses and investigated
the clustering pattern in younger individuals as well.

all variables are right-skewed. The total fraction of missing values
was 5.7%. Observations tended to be missing according to type,
that is, if one PCB was missing, the rest of the PCBs also tended to
be missing and so on. No obvious correlation between the
contaminant types could be seen in the pattern of missing values
and therefore we did not impute the missing values. Figure 1 (top)
shows the result of the hierarchical cluster analysis and the
subsequent stability analysis in the PIVUS data. Two clusters of
PCB could be identified: one corresponding to low/medium
chlorinated and one corresponding to medium/high chlorinated
PCBs. TNC and HCB were parts of the low/medium chlorinated
PCB cluster. PCB126 and PCB 169 did not seem to cluster with the
other PCBs. The rest of the investigated contaminants do not
seem to co-vary much. Figure 1 (bottom) shows the observed
clustering in the NHANES data. Additional analyses in younger age
groups in the NHANES data revealed a similar picture. PCBs 138,
153, 156, and 157 did, however, seem to cluster in a separate third
cluster in individuals aged younger than 50 (data not shown).
Two principal components were enough to explain 490% of
the variablility in the medium/high chlorinated cluster. All PCBs
loaded negative on the first component, whereas PCBs 194, 206
and 209 loaded negative on the second component as well. PCBs
156, 157, 170, 180, and 189 loaded positive on the second
component, suggesting two subgroups within the medium/high
chlorinated cluster. Figure 2 shows these findings. For the low/
medium chlorinated cluster, three components were needed to
explain 4 90% of the cluster variability. All contaminants in the
low/medium chlorinated cluster, except HCB, loaded negative on
the first component. For the contaminants that loaded positive on
the third component (TNC, PCBs 99, 138, and 153) only TNC
loaded negative on the second component. PCBs 74, 105, and 118
all loaded negative on the third component, suggesting two
subgroups within the low/medium chlorinated cluster as well.
Figure 3 (top) shows the loadings for those contaminants in the
low/medium chlorinated cluster that scored positive on the third
component and Figure 3 (bottom) shows the loadings for the
contaminants that loaded negative on the third component. From
Figures 2 and 3 it seems plausible that four subgroups exist within
each cluster and that HCB and TNC really are not part of the low/
medium chlorinated cluster. No obvious clustering could be
discerned for the remainder of the variables. Using linear
regression within each subgroup with the subgroup-specific
first principal component score as the outcome variable, we
deduced that PCBs 118 and 153 could be useful markers for the
Table 1. Descriptive statistics on individual contaminants presented as median (25th--75th percentile) for males and females separately and

low/medium chlorinated cluster, and PCBs 170 and 209 could be
useful markers for the medium/high chlorinated cluster, each PCB
representing a subgroup within the two clusters. PCBs 118 and
153 explained 91% and 95% of their respective subgroup's
variance and PCBs 170 and 209 both explained 81% of their
subgroup's variance. This indicates that some clustering occurs
among the contaminants, but in general the contaminants co-vary
little. The additional analysis by BMI did not alter the conclusions
as the clustering pattern was very similar in the three BMI groups
as shown in Figure 4.
DISCUSSION
The main findings in the present study was that except for two
PCB-clusters and four subgroups within them, little shared
variation was seen for the circulating levels of the investigated
environmental contaminants. The practical implication of this
finding is that when studying the effect of mixtures of these
compounds, one has to analyze circulating levels of most of these
investigated compounds. Only for the PCBs could a reduction in
measured circulating congeners be performed using marker
contaminants.
POPs
Median levels of PCBs 105, 118, 138, 153, 156, 157, and 180, as well
as TNC and HCB, were similar to those reported in men21 and
women22 from the general population of Sweden. This is hardly
surprising, as the studied subjects originate from the same area,
even though subjects in our study were slightly older. Two distinct
clusters could be identified among the POPs based on measure-
ments of circulating levels, one cluster representing the low-
chlorinated PCBs and one representing highly chlorinated PCBs.
PCBs have previously been classified into group depending on their
degree of chlorination5 or their biological properties.4,6 It is evident
from the dendrogram in Figure 1 (top), however, that the unifying
theme within the two clusters is the degree of chlorination so our
results tend to agree more with the grouping into three categories
based on the level of chlorination proposed by Moysich et al.5 There
are PCBs with six chlorine atoms in both clusters so the degree of
chlorination is not alone responsible for our findings. PCBs 156 and
157 have six chlorine atoms but are co-planar as opposed to PCBs
153 and 138 so the structure may also have a part for PCBs with six
chlorine atoms. The number of chlorine atoms in the PCBs is the
major determinant of lipid solubility and thereby of the toxicoki-
netic properties of the compounds. It is well known that PCBs with a
high degree of chlorination have a considerably longer half-life than
those with a lower degree of chlorination. We believe, therefore,
that the two PCB clusters are derived from the same sources of
exposures and are retained in the body in a similar way because of
their similar elimination half-life. However, similar elimination half-
life is not sufficient for the POPs to cluster in the present analysis.
DDE, a breakdown product of DDT, has a similar elimination rate to
the highly chlorinated PCBs, but is not found, despite this
characteristic, in the medium/high-chlorinated PCB cluster. This
might indicate that the route of exposure is not similar to that seen
for the high-chlorinated PCBs. Another explanation might be the
timing of the peak of exposure. In Sweden, DDT was banned several
years before PCBs were banned. Thus, even if the toxicokinetics of
DDE and the medium/high chlorinated PCBs share similarities in
terms of elimination half-life, the timing of exposure might
influence the degree of co-variation between the compounds.
For further analysis of health effects of mixtures of POPs, a few
marker PCBs may be chosen from the low/medium chlorinated
PCB cluster and from the medium/high chlorinated cluster,

respectively. Most of the variation in circulating levels within those
clusters is covered by these marker compounds. Based on our
results, we suggest that PCBs 118 and 153 could be suitable
markers for the low/medium chlorinated cluster, and PCBs 170
and 209 for the medium/high chlorinated cluster, each represent-
ing a subgroup within the clusters. PCBs 126 and 169, congeners
often used in experimental research, do not co-vary with the other
PCBs, and must therefore be measured in analysis of health effects
of mixtures. Thus, the 16 measured PCBs could be reduced to four
marker PCBs, apart from PCBs 126 and 169, without any major loss
of information. PCBs 153 and 156 have previously been suggested
as markers of PCB exposure in a similar population.21 A difference
between that study and this is that they sought markers that
predicted the total amount of PCB, that is, a sum of the individual
congeners, whereas we used principal component scores as our
summary measures. This study confirms the suitability of PCB 153
as a marker contaminant and that PCB 156 does cluster with PCBs
170 and 180, one of which we found to be a good marker
contaminant, so in general our results agree with those in Glynn
et al.21 However, they did not find markers for low-chlorinated
PCBs, whereas we found two markers that were representative of
the low/medium chlorinated cluster.
DDE has often been used a marker substance of POP exposure.
Our study shows that as the correlation with other POPs is poor,
measurements of DDE must be complemented by measurements
of other POPs to obtain the greater picture needed for the study
of health effects of mixtures.
Plastic-Associated Compounds
The plastic-associated compounds analyzed in the present study,
BPA and phthalates, are high-volume chemicals that have been
used for decades. These compounds have a considerably faster
elimination compared with the POPs. Short-branched phthalates
are excreted in urine as its monoester, whereas more
long-branched phthalates undergo several biotransformations.23
From this standpoint, it is not surprising that the plastic-associated
compounds do not cluster with the POPs, as the kinetics and
the daily exposure of these agents are very different from the
POPs. Thus, in order to evaluate the toxic effects of mixtures
of POPs and the plastic-associated compounds, it is obvious
that measurements of these compounds in the circulation must

be performed in parallel as the co-variation between POPs and the
plastic-associated compounds is very low.
Metals
The metals analyzed in the present study represent those with
different kinetic properties and actions derived from different
sources of exposure. It is therefore not surprising that they do not
co-vary with each other or with the POPs or plastic-associated
chemicals. Thus, measurements of circulating levels of these
compounds must also be included in the evaluation of the
biological effects of mixtures of environmental compounds.
Age, Gender and BMI
The present examination was performed in an elderly population.
As levels of POPs tend to increase by age because of their
chemical properties and as the highest levels of BPA are found in
children,24 it is evident that the findings in the present study
cannot automatically be extrapolated to younger subjects. The
additional analyses in the NHANES data in younger age groups
revealed similar patterns, although the clustering of the PCB
congeners with six chlorine atoms differed slightly, possibly
indicating a third cluster giving further support to the grouping
proposed by Moysich et al.5 Furthermore, as exposure to some
POPs, like the OC pesticides and PCBs, is lower nowadays
compared with some decades back, each generation is exposed
to different mixtures of environmental pollutants, a fact that has to
be remembered when evaluating the biological effects of
environmental exposures in humans. Although gender differences
have been reported for some of the chemicals evaluated in the
present study, we did not find any major differences between
men and women regarding the co-variation of the environmental
pollutants evaluated in the present study (data not shown). With
levels of contaminants in human tissue over time being possibly
influenced by BMI, under the assumption of a similar total body
uptake,25 clustering patterns could also differ depending on BMI.
In this study, we could not demonstrate differences in clustering
patterns, indicating that the relationships between the contami-
nants are not affected much by differences in BMI.
Validation Using the NHANES Data
A comparison with data from the NHANES study reveals a striking
similarity. It is not surprising that levels of the individual conta-
minants differ, as we are comparing individuals from different popu-
lations, but the fact that the contaminants cluster in a similar
manner gives further weight to our findings.
Methodological Considerations
As cluster analysis results are sensitive to the method used to
calculate the distances between the clusters, we applied several
methods and visually compared the results. Clustering based on
different methods provided similar results. Two clusters of PCBs
could be discerned and they appeared somewhat correlated with
each other in some graphs. We chose the complete-linkage
method for ease of interpretation as it seeks to form as compact
clusters as possible, in contrast to the single-linkage technique,
which tends to maximize connectedness between clusters. Other
clustering techniques tend to produce results in between the
complete- and the single-linkage methods. Other dissimilarity
measures, such as the absolute value of the ordinary Spearman
rank correlation or the squared Spearman rank correlation,
showed similar clustering patterns, indicating possible non-linear
but not necessarily non-monotonic relationships between the
contaminants.
We chose to transform the contaminants using canonical variate
analysis. Other approaches may be the natural log-transform or the
the Box-Cox transformation, but our choice is more tailored to this
specific situation in that it maximizes the correlation between
the transformed variables and thereby makes them more useful for
the PCA.
In conclusion, there seems to be little co-variation among
environmental contaminants in the circulation. PCBs clustered into
two cluster and four subgroups within the clusters mainly based on
their chlorination, that is, the number of chlorine atoms. This has
implications for further studies on the health effect of mixtures of
contaminants, as one has to measure the circulating levels of a large
number of individual contaminants to obtain necessary information
on exposure of different compounds, with the exception of the
PCBs where certain marker compounds could be used.
