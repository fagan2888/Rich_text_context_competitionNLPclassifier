The Economic Value Of
Informal Caregiving
President Clinton's proposal to provide relief to family caregivers
opens a long-overdue discussion of this "invisible" health care
sector.
by Peter S. Arno, Carol Levine, and Margaret M. Memmott
ABSTRACT: This study explores the current market value of the care provided
by unpaid family members and friends to ill and disabled adults. Using large,
national data sets we estimate that the national economic value of informal
caregiving was $196 billion in 1997. This figure dwarfs national spending for
formal home health care ($32 billion) and nursing home care ($83 billion).
Estimates for five states also are presented. This study broadens the issue of
informal caregiving from the micro level, where individual caregivers attempt to
cope with the stresses and responsibilities of caregiving, to the macro level of
the health care system, which must find more effective ways to support family
caregivers.
In a major policy initiative the Clinton administration
recently proposed a $6 billion five-year package to begin to ad-
dress the long-term care needs of persons with chronic illness or
disabilities and their families.1 By explicitly recognizing that family
members are the core long-term care providers in the U.S. health
care system, this initiative opens a long-overdue policy discussion.
Because "informal" caregiving lies outside the market economy
and is socially and politically invisible, its economic value is not
generally acknowledged. Although some aspects of families' contri-
butions to patient care are impossible to measure (such as the com-
fort of being cared for at home), other aspects can be expressed
quantitatively. This study addresses one such question: What is the
current market value of the unpaid caregiving provided by family
members and friends to adults who are chronically or terminally ill
or seriously disabled? There have been some limited attempts to
arrive at such a number, but no recent systematic estimates.2 This
study begins to fill that gap.

Study Methods
We analyzed two key questions: (1) What is the national preva-
lence of informal caregiving; and (2) what is a reasonable market
wage that would have to be paid to replace informal caregiving?
Prevalence and definitions. National prevalence figures were
derived in two steps: (1) estimating the number of informal care-
givers; and (2) determining the hours of care provided per caregiver.
For the former we examined a variety of national data sets, including
the Survey on Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the Na-
tional Survey of Families and Households (NSFH), the National
Health Interview Survey (NHIS), and the National Long-Term Care
Survey (NLTCS). Because SIPP and the NSFH provide the most
comprehensive data on the prevalence of caregiving in the general
population, we used these surveys and their definitions of caregiving
to develop our estimates. (The NLTCS includes only Medicare pa-
tients over age sixty-five.)
SIPP is a national, multipanel, longitudinal survey of adults, rep-
resentative of households in the civilian, noninstitutionalized popu-
lation.3 The 1986 survey wave collected information from approxi-
mately 19,100 households on whether persons age fifteen or older
needed or provided personal assistance with everyday activities. A
person was considered to need personal assistance only if his or her
limitation was the result of a health condition that had lasted or was
expected to last three months or longer. We assumed that the ratio
of caregivers to the U.S. population, by age cohorts, was the same in
1997 as it was in 1986. This yielded an estimated twenty-four million
caregivers in 1997.
The first wave of the NSFH included a national probability sam-
ple of 13,017 noninstitutionalized American adults in 1987 and 1988.4
Respondents were asked about the need for or provision of personal
assistance due to a disability or chronic illness. A similar approach
was used to estimate the number of caregivers as described above.
The number of caregivers providing personal assistance to adults
(age eighteen or older) was disaggregated by sex: 11.3 million men
and 16.1 million women. Assuming that the ratio of caregivers to the
general population by age and sex was the same in 1997 as it was in
1987­1988, this yielded an estimated 27.6 million caregivers in 1997.
Number of caregiving hours. The best overall source of data for
estimating the number of caregiving hours in the general population
was found in the National Family Caregiving Survey.5 Fielded in
1996, the survey was based on a nationally representative sample of
1,509 English-speaking households with telephones. This survey
yielded an average of 17.9 caregiving hours per week. This figure was

used in this analysis because of the general nature and size of the
sample; because of the lack of better estimates from larger, more
comprehensive surveys; and because it is a conservative estimate
that is lower than those found in other published studies.
Most studies reporting hours of informal caregiving targeted rela-
tively disabled and chronically ill elderly persons or used small sam-
ples focusing on specific medical conditions. Richard Ernst and Joel
Hay estimated the number of unpaid caregiver hours from nine
studies of community-dwelling demented or mentally impaired pa-
tients at 52.5 hours per week.6 In small-sample studies of Alzhe-
imer's disease patients, ventilator-dependent patients, and Parkin-
son's disease patients, investigators reported an average of 70.0, 58.8,
and 22.0 hours per week, respectively.7
Wage rate. Two general approaches have been used in the litera-
ture to impute an economic value to the quantity of caregiving. The
first entails measurement of the opportunity costs to caregivers of
lost or forgone wages and benefits as a result of caregiving responsi-
bilities.8 This approach is not used here because considerable care-
giving is provided by retired persons. Thus, to impute their eco-
nomic worth only from forgone earnings would undervalue their
contribution. The second approach, which we have chosen, applies
a market wage rate to caregiving activity.9 Because our main focus is
estimating the potential cost in today's market if informal caregiving
had to be replaced by paid workers, we selected a wage rate that
reflects today's labor market.
Initially, two wage rates were considered: the current minimum
wage ($5.15 per hour) and the average, national rate for home health
aides ($11.20 per hour).10 Because caregiving tasks performed by
family members range from the relatively unskilled to the highly
skilled, we chose $8.18 per hour as a midrange wage rate. This figure
does not include benefits or administrative overhead, which are
required for formal employment.
Findings
Caregiving prevalence estimates derived from large, distinct, na-
tional data sets generated a narrow range of estimates for the
number of caregivers in 1997--24.0 million to 27.6 million. The mid-
range estimate is 25.8 million.11 Applying the average weekly figure
of 17.9 hours of informal caregiving to the number of estimated
caregivers yields approximately 22­26 billion hours of caregiving
per year, nationwide, with a midrange estimate of 24 billion hours.
Using midrange figures, the national economic value of informal
caregiving in 1997 was $196 billion (Exhibit 1).

spending for formal home health care ($32 billion) and nursing
home care ($83 billion) (Exhibit 2). At the midrange estimate of
$196 billion annually, the economic value of informal caregiving is
equivalent to approximately 18 percent of total national health care
spending ($1,092 billion). Informal caregiving is not counted as part
of national health care spending. If it were, the trillion-dollar figure
would rise by nearly $200 billion.

Using the same methods we calculated the number of caregivers
and the estimated economic value for five states: California, New
York, Texas, Florida, and New Jersey. California led the way, with
2.9 million caregivers at an estimated economic value of $22.1 bil-
lion; New York followed with 1.8 million/$13.6 billion; Texas, 1.7
million/$12.6 billion; Florida, 1.4 million/$10.5 billion; and New Jer-
sey, 777,500/$5.9 billion.12
Implications
Imputing an economic value to the extraordinary level of care-
giving described in this study does not detract from the emotional,
cultural, and societal values expressed through informal caregiving.
On the contrary, it enhances their importance by providing a tangi-
ble measure of the vast but vulnerable base upon which our chronic
care system rests.
Toll on individuals, families, and society. Caregiving has be-
come a normative experience. Although it may bring personal grati-
fication to some, it clearly takes a well-documented toll on many
caregivers' physical and mental health.13 The costs are not only to the
individual, however. Stress and exhaustion may lead to increased
health care resources' being devoted to the caregiver as well as to the
patient and may exacerbate family destabilization and impoverish-
ment. These are concerns not only for individuals and families but
also for the larger society. As the population ages and as chronic
conditions continue to account for a high proportion of medical
costs, these concerns will become even more critical.14
This study has explored only one aspect of the economic impact
of family caregiving. Other studies have addressed the substantial
direct costs families pay in unreimbursed health care expenses, even
if they are insured.15 Other important factors are the loss of income
and other benefits, such as Social Security, when a caregiver gives up
a job or reduces work hours.16
Policy options. Our focus on the economic value of informal
caregiving should not be interpreted as an argument to pay care-
givers. Neither do we dismiss this as a policy option. Several states
already have limited programs in place to pay informal caregivers.17
Paying some categories of informal caregivers under clearly defined
circumstances may provide a level of flexibility and continuity that
is difficult to attain in the formal system.
Beyond the tax credits and state information and referral pro-
grams outlined in the Clinton administration's proposal, other op-
tions include amending the Family and Medical Leave Act to make it
more accessible to employees in small firms and its benefits better
known to eligible workers. Social Security credits also might be

Need for caregiver support. Because family caregivers are not
typically part of policy discussions, the limitations on their ability to
provide care and their needs for training and support are not usually
considered when decisions are made about how to deliver care or
save money. Informal caregivers are seldom adequately trained and
almost never offered appropriate follow-up services, reevaluation of
care arrangements, or referrals to community services. They are left
to negotiate an increasingly complex and fragmented system and to
find whatever help they can by whatever means they can.
Spending for formal home health care has grown dramati-
cally in recent years--more than three times faster than spend-
ing for hospital or physician services in 1990­1997.18 Efforts to
constrain this growth by better management and monitoring are
justified. However, cutting costs by cutting vitally needed services
will only add to the already heavy burden on informal caregivers.
They are the bedrock of our nation's chronic care system; we must
find more effective ways to support and sustain them.
