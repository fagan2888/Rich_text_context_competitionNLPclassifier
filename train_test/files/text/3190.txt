Abstract
The game-theoretical analysis of this paper shows that stress tests that cover
the entire banking sector (macro stress tests) can be performed by institutional
supervisors to improve welfare. In a multi-receiver framework of Bayesian per-
suasion we show that a banking authority can create value when committing
to disclose the stress-testing methodology (signal-generating process) together
with the stress test result (signal). Disclosing two pieces of information is a
typical procedure used in stress tests. By optimally choosing these two sig-
nals, supervisors can deliver superior information to prudent investors and
enhance welfare. The paper offers a new theory to explain why stress tests
are generally welfare enhancing. We also offer a treatment of the borderline
case where the banking sector is hit by a crisis, in which case the supervisor
will optimally disclose an uninformative signal.

Non-technical summary
The present paper applies a game-theoretical model to analyze the impact of an
optimal disclosure in stress test designs that cover the entire banking sector (macro
stress tests). Specifically, we inquire to which extent investors will make optimal use
of information stemming from such stress tests when deciding to provide liquidity
to banks, e.g. via bank deposits or by purchasing bank bonds. In addition, the
paper deals with the issue on how to optimally design supervisory macro stress
tests when the banking supervisor pursue the goal to ensure a macro-economically
optimal level of banking activities, this by convincing investors to provide the overall
optimal amount of funding to the banking sector.
In our analysis we present a multi-receiver model of a persuasion game. Persua-
sion games belong to the larger class of cheap talk games. In our model banking
supervisors, by making use of macro stress tests, can generate information about
the actual stability level of the banking sector. Banking supervisors, however, face a
commitment problem when they aim at influencing investors' decisions by disclosure
of stress tests results. From an investors' point of view, stress test results, which
are disclosed by banking supervisors, basically do not constitute a reliable form of
information about the true state of the banking system (cheap talk).
The game-theoretical analysis of the present paper, however, shows that banking
supervisors will optimally design macro stress test in a way that permits them to
influence the decisions of investors to increase social welfare; this by both disclosing
the method of the stress tests used as well as the stress test result. We furthermore
show that macro stress tests pursued by banking supervisors will always increase the
informativeness of the disclosure mechanism. However, banking supervisors should
generally not aim at designing macro stress tests to completely eliminate uncertainty
at the investors' side as to the actual state of the banking sector. Only this feature
will permit supervisors to avoid triggering some possibly extreme forms of investor
behavior (such as a complete withdrawal from bank financing, or, in turn, pursuing
highly risky financial decisions).

Das vorliegende Papier analysiert mit Hilfe eines spieltheoretischen Modells die

Optimal Disclosure of Supervisory Information in
the Banking Sector1
1 Introduction
It is common knowledge that banks improve the allocation of capital in an economy
and in so doing, increase social welfare. Since Diamond and Dybvig (1983), scholars
have systematically researched how such processes work and what the options are
for a banking system to provide adequate forms of liquidity to borrowers. One of the
most prominent forms of liquidity provision occurs through maturity transformation,
by which banks convert securities with short maturities into the long-term forms of
liquidity that borrowers frequently request.
It lies in the very nature of such transformation processes that they come with
a risk: creating liquidity may cause financial fragility, as the banking system may
become unstable when investors do not have the necessary knowledge about bor-
rowers,2 and this instability may spread throughout the whole banking system.3
In this context, it is easy to see why Jaime Caruana, the General Manager of the
Bank for International Settlements, has emphasized in particular that
"[...] strengthened, transparent disclosure is good for markets, because
it helps investors make more informed decisions."4
Transparency is valuable as it improves the information accessible to investors,
and this increased transparency reduces uncertainty, leading to better risk-adjusted
behavior on the investors' side.
Stress tests represent a very prominent form of information disclosure pursued
by institutional supervisors. The European Banking Authority, the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) in the U.S., as well as national supervisory authorities

in the U.K. and in Japan, respectively, have designed and performed a series of new
stress tests over the past few years. Strikingly, the number of countries publishing
bank stress tests has increased from 0 to 40 over the past decade.5 An unprecedented
fact is the frequency by which such macroeconomic stress tests are being performed,
which undoubtedly will shatter the commonly-perceived underestimation of their
impact, and one may safely assume that larger and more centralized supervisory
authorities will prefer to make more use of such tests rather than less.
Two new papers support this view, namely that enhanced transparency through
disclosing stress test results is beneficial to financial stability. First, Goldstein and
Sapra (2012), who research the impact of disclosure on ex-ante incentives of banks,
are strongly in favor of a public disclosure of stress-test results. The authors believe
"that ­ at least from a financial stability perspective ­ the benefits of disclosing
stress test results are undeniable."6
Second, an empirical paper by Horvath and Vasco (2012) shows that the degree
of transparency concerning financial stability has significantly increased since 2000,
which underpins the general viewpoint concerning the value of transparency. More
interestingly, they find that greater transparency is beneficial during typical financial
periods financial stress is low. Yet, Horvath and Vasco (2012) also detect that greater
transparency will increase financial stress when financial systems are undergoing a
time of severe distress, in which situations more transparency may lead to adverse
effects.7 This result is addressed in our paper in a borderline case where the banking
sector is completely vulnerable. In this special case, disclosure optimally remains
uninformative.
In this light, striving for more transparency has undoubtedly become a central
issue for a sector that many authors have described as the epitome of an "opaque"
industry.8 That stress tests will, in general, reduce the inherent degree of opacity in
the banking sector, has been emphasized by Peristiani et al. (2010) in their study.
While they see banks as "neither black boxes nor open books," the argument that
stress tests will generally permit to reduce bank opaqueness can also be found in
recent research done by Petrella and Resti (2011) and their analysis of stress tests
performed by the European Banking Authority. Significant market reactions reveal
that stress tests do help investors make better decisions.
A clarification is in order. While empirical studies show that stress tests leads to
a reduction of bank opaqueness, opacity is also an issue in central bank's communi-
cation and monetary policy. Opacity, in this context, seems to remain a generally
accepted fact to which economists have not added much new insight. For example,
Stein (1989), in an early application of Crawford and Sobel's (1982) seminal article

on strategic information transmission to central bank disclosure policies, has ar-
gued that in equilibrium, disclosure between a public authority and an uninformed
investor should optimally remain coarse and limited.
Morris and Shin (2000, 2002) have argued that public information is a double-
edged instrument. The private information that actors possess may in some situa-
tions render public information detrimental for a central bank's policy. Disclosing
all available public (and noisy) information may then lead to suboptimal decision
making, as receivers will put too much weight on the noise in the public information.
James and Lawler (2011) confirm the aspect that disclosing too much information
will have adverse effects and decrease welfare.9 However, it should be added that
Morris and Shin's (2002) work has actually opened up an extended discussion, in
which their model has been interpreted as arguing in favor of more transparency, as
Svensson (2006) and Morris, Shin and Tong (2006) have shown in two replies.
Our explanation is entirely different in its approach. We offer a Bayesian persua-
sion game with multiple receivers to explain why macro stress tests are performed.
We believe that opacity, while at the center of explanations concerning central bank
policies over the past decades, cannot account for the specific nature of stress tests.
Based on the disclosure process that makes use of two pieces of information, we
propose a new theory that contrasts with earlier work. Macroeconomic stress tests,
the way they are perceived by financial markets and the "dialogue about financial
stability vulnerabilities"10 require a new understanding that this paper is set out to
deliver.
What we know is that a supervisory agency both discloses the stress test design,
and the result. It is this property that carries a new viewpoint. Why informed
supervisors are willing to disclose multiple pieces of information has, to our best
knowledge, not been analyzed at all in the context of financial and supervisory dis-
closure. We show that a public banking authority can generally "persuade" investors
over a wide range of (prior) beliefs to take actions toward a socially optimal trade-
off between individual risk bearing and the provision of liquidity to the banking
sector. By making optimal use of two informational components (the result and
the signal-generating process) stress tests will influence a continuum of prudent in-
vestors toward an optimal and risk-adjusted provision of liquidity to the economy,
and, in doing so, they increase welfare.
The theoretical framework that we develop belongs to a new class of disclo-
sure games, called Bayesian persuasion games. While still belonging to the larger
strand of literature on cheap talk in the tradition of Crawford and Sobel (1982),
persuasion games lift this literature onto a new level, permitting new insights into
disclosure processes between an informed sender and uninformed receivers. Bayesian
9This, again, contrasts with the findings of Horvath and Vasco (2012).

persuasion games assume that the sender can, to some extent, control the commu-
nication environment of the receiver(s). When there is more than just one signal ­
that is, when the sender can use the signal-generating process as it takes place in
stress-testing procedures to deliver additional information to the receiver ­ the game
reveals properties that are much different than those found in standard cheap-talk
games. Since he knows that the receivers will update their prior beliefs by using
Bayes' rule, the sender will be willing to perform such a test. This specific feature
permits the sender to commit to disclose, even when the test results are not known
to him ex ante. The capability of the sender to commit to such a procedure now
eliminates a well-known drawback of cheap talk games, namely that messages are
arbitrary for a wide range of beliefs, and therefore create strategic complexity.11
Consequently, the players always face the problem of coordinating on a common
language. In persuasion games, this problem is eliminated by the fact that now the
sender creates a "meaning" of messages. Because of this property, persuasion games
now exhibit commitment power, and the sender no longer needs to best respond to
any strategy of the receiver(s).12
This specific literature on persuasion games13 has been laid out in one seminal
article: Kamenica and Gentzkow (2011) (KG hereafter), and this in a setting with
one sender and one receiver. KG show for a wide range of parameters that the
sender is strictly better off disclosing both pieces of information.
In an application different from ours, and with an extension toward a (discrete)
multi-receiver setting, Wang (2012) analyzes voting rules in setups with public and
private disclosure. Our paper differs from hers in several ways. We do not analyze
majority voting; in our model, every investor's behavior is influenced by the supervi-
sor. Moreover, we limit our analysis to public signals, that is, we exclude the option
of the sender to privately disclose different signals to a subset of receivers.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model, defining
the timing of the game, players' preferences and the supervisor's utility function,
the investor decisions, and the value of disclosure, treating the issue of Bayesian
Plausibility in a continuous multi-receiver setting. Section 3 determines the super-
visor's problem, deriving conditions for optimal disclosure, studying the benchmark
of uninformative disclosure, and it expands on some welfare implications. Section 4
concludes. The proofs to all lemmas are given in the appendix.
11See Sobel, 2010.
12Sobel (2010) in his overview shows furthermore that even under arbitrary choices of messages,
coordination failures disappear.
13For a different treatment see Chakraborty and Harbaugh (2011) and their multidimensional
cheap-talk model without commitment and large biases.

2 Model
2.1 Primitives
Consider a setting with two types of agents: a single banking supervisor (sender)
and a (infinitely) large number of investors (receivers). The supervisor (S) owns a
technology (a stress testing mechanism) that provides him with reliable information
about the true status of the banking sector under his control. While information
acquisition is costly, these costs are fixed and do not depend on the information
revealed about the banking sector. We assume a binary state space of the supervi-
sor's information: either the banking sector is firm / sound (F) or vulnerable (V ),
meaning that some adverse situation or crisis hurts the banking sector either only
marginally or heavily. We formally summarize this binary state space by  = {F, V }
where  denotes a realization of a certain stress testing exercise. The prior (objec-
tive) probability distribution over  is Pr(V ) = p and Pr(F) = 1 - p.
The investors (R) do not know the state of the banking sector, but they hold
prior beliefs (b) about the probability that the banking sector is vulnerable. These
priors may be considered to arise from experiences over past periods, or they may
be based on the evaluation of other institutions such as rating agencies. Prior beliefs
are, hence, considered to be heterogenous among investors.
We assume that the total number of investors is infinitely large and can be nor-
malized to one. Further, let g(b) denote the continuous function which represents
the distribution of prior beliefs over all investors. The corresponding continuous
function G(b) denotes the cumulative distribution function of prior beliefs as well as
the number of investors having prior beliefs of, at most, b.
Based on their individual beliefs, investors make their investment decisions and
choose an action in the action space. They decide on their behavior in the banking
sector. The action space of investors is assumed to be binary as well: investors may
either act prudently (P) or riskily (R). Prudent behavior means that the investor
under consideration believes that the banking sector is vulnerable and is, therefore,
willing to provide funding to banks (e.g. by depositing money with banks or by
buying bank bonds) only to a minimum amount which is backed by some deposit
insurance mechanism or through State guarantees. All investors whose individual
beliefs are beyond some threshold probability bT
behave this way. Risky behavior,
in contrast, refers to decisions that result in investors providing much more funds
to the banking sector than the benchmark would minimally suggest. This latter
behavior occurs when investors choose individual beliefs below the threshold proba-
bility, bT
. The binary action space will be denoted by A = {P, R} in the following,
and a denotes a certain realization. The threshold probability bT
then defines when
investors prefer to switch from risky to prudent behavior because they believe that
the probability that the banking sector is vulnerable is too high.
5
What essentially follows from these assumptions is that they imply an overall
distribution of beliefs, which now determines the total number of investors who
behave prudently or riskily, respectively. Specifically, G(bT
) = Pr(b  bT
) is the
total number of investors who prefer a risky strategy whereas 1-G(bT
) = Pr(b > bT
)
is the total number of prudent investors given their prior beliefs.
2.2 Timing
The timing of the game is as follows. First, the supervisor chooses an information
disclosure mechanism  to induce investors to act in the supervisor's interest. The
information disclosure mechanism consists of two elements: a signal from a binary
realization space of the supervisor's stress tests results D  {f, v}, plus a related
family of conditional distributions {|·}
over D. The conditional distributions
follow the design, result, and accuracy of stress tests. In mathematical terms, the
design of a stress test determines the probabilities of the result d  D, given that
the true state of the banking sector is   . That is, we assume that the supervisor
does not cheat on investors about the stress test result. Rather, the stress-test result
will be always reported truthfully. Yet the supervisor can design the stress test in
such a way that an incorrect result becomes more or less likely.
Let (v|V ) ((f|V )) and (f|F) ((v|F)) denote the probabilities that the stress
test generates correct (incorrect) results. The stress test design determines the
following probabilities:
(v|V )
(f|V ) = 1 - (v|V )
and
(f|F)
(v|F) = 1 - (f|F)
.
In the next step, the supervisor carries out a stress testing exercise, observes
(privately) stress test result d  D and reports this result together with the full
information about the stress test's design, i.e. (·), to investors.
The investors, thereafter, observe both the supervisor's choice of the stress test
mechanism and the stress test realizations to decide on either a prudent or a risky
action to provide funding to the banking sector.
As already mentioned in the introduction, information disclosure in our model
as well as in KG does not only mean to send out a single message as in standard
models of cheap talk. Instead, disclosure includes information about the signal-
generating process and about the obtained signal as the supervisor in our model
reveals information to the public about the stress test design (including underlying
assumption, information regarding the data analysis, and so on) and the outcome
of the stress test.
6
2.3 Preferences
Investors' preferences strongly depend on making correct investment decisions. For
simplicity, let these utilities take values of 1 or 0: each investor receives a utility
of 1 if he makes the correct decision, UR
(P, V ) = UR
(R, F). Otherwise, his utility
remains UR
(P, F) = UR
(R, V ) = 0.14
The general aim of banking supervisors is the promotion of stability of the bank-
ing sector (cf. BCBS, 2011, para 1). In this regard there are, however, two aspects
that a supervisor needs to take into account. First, while acknowledging the eco-
nomic role of banks in providing financing to private households, firms, and gov-
ernments supervisors are also aware that the banking sector requires funding. The
banking literature, in turn, has shown that the structure of banks' balance sheets,
i.e. using short-term liabilities to fund long-term assets, makes individual banks
as well as the banking sector as a whole vulnerable to shocks in the financial or
economic environment.15 Second, the supervisor is aware of the fact that investors
suffer in terms of utility when their investment decisions turn out to be incorrect.
It is crucial for an understanding that both aspects are interrelated: information
disclosed by the supervisor may cause investor reactions that affect bank funding
and in this way the stability of the banking sector.
A supervisor's utility function has therefore to consider both aspects. First, the
supervisor is aware of the fact that herding behavior of investors - either too many
investors acting prudently or too many investors acting riskily - may negatively
impact the banking sector as a whole. With too many prudent investors banks
may face severe funding problems which may in the end make the system even
more vulnerable. In turn, with too many investors acting riskily, banks may find
themselves in a situation of excess liquidity which may trigger excessive risk taking
of banks in order to profitably invest available funds. But excessive risk taking will
also aggravate the vulnerability of the banking sector.
As a result, given the objective probability p of the banking sector being vul-
nerable, we assume that there exists a certain number of prudent investors |P|max
that maximizes the supervisor's utility. That is, for a given p at |P|max there is an
optimal balance between providing funds to banks and investors' preference for cor-
rect investment decisions. A higher number of prudent investors, on the one hand,
may increase the danger of aggravating the vulnerability of the banking sector by
a shortage of bank funding. On the other hand, fewer prudent investors may also
increase the danger of aggravating the banking sector's vulnerability due excessive
14Although each single investor makes his own decision we do not use an index for a certain
investor. This is only for notational convenience and does not affect results because investors do
not differ regarding utility functions.
15See, eg, Diamond and Dybvig (1983), Diamond (1997), Diamond and Rajan (2001), and Allen
and Gale (2000).

risk taking of banks.
In addition, when the supervisor designs the disclosure mechanism (including the
stress test design), the final outcome of the stress test and therefore the investors'
responses to information disclosure, will remain uncertain. The supervisor can only
form expectations about investor behavior. Therefore we assume in the following that
the supervisor's utility function is invariant to the stress test outcome. Furthermore
the utility function is considered hill-shaped, reaching a maximum at |P|max and
being zero at the extremes when either all investors act prudently or all investors
act riskily.
Put in more formal terms, let US
(|P|) denote the supervisor's utility as a function
of the number |P| of prudent investors, i.e. investors who choose a = P.16 The su-
pervisor's utility becomes zero when either all investors act riskily or all investors act
prudently. Moreover, there exists a number |P|max  (0; 1) where the supervisor's
utility reaches a maximum Umax
S
.17 In sum, we assume the following continuously
differentiable hill-shaped curve representing the supervisor's utility:
US
= US
(|P|) with US
(|P|) > (<)0  |P| < (>)|P|max and US
(|P|max) = 0. (1)
2.4 Investor beliefs
2.4.1 Bayesian updating
By choosing the appropriate stress test design, the supervisors define the framework
which shows investors - connected to the commitment assumption - how to update
prior beliefs using Bayes' rule when the stress test shows a specific outcome. As
in KG, Wang (2011) and Sobel (2010), the supervisor is able to influence investor
behavior in a certain way.
Digression: The Single-Receiver Case (following KG)
Before introducing our multi-receiver model, it seems worthwhile to briefly illus-
trate the standard persuasion game between a single investor (receiver), who, con-
16Due to our assumptions, |P| is found by inserting the threshold probability bT
in the cumulative
distribution function of investor beliefs in a given situation. For instance, in the case of a non-
informative disclosure mechanism we have |P| = 1 - G(bT
). In the case of effective information
disclosure we have |P| = 1 - ^
Gv
(bT
) and |P| = 1 - ^
Gf
(bT
) when the supervisor discloses signal
d = v and d = f, respectively.
17We do not explicitly consider p to be an argument of US
(·) as we earlier assumed that p is given
exogenously. That is, given the (objective) probability p there exists a socially optimal number of
prudent investors that maximizes the supervisor's utility. Note that |P|max may change with the
exogenously given probability p.
8
ditional on observing that the banking sector is sound (state F), holds prior beliefs
^
x = (v|F) and ^
y = (f|F). In KG, the sender maximizes the overall probability to
convince the receiver to change his or her mind about investing:
max p^
x + (1 - p)^
y
s.t. ^
y  1
2
.
The informed sender will optimally choose a pair of ^
x and ^
y such that the re-
ceiver, upon observing this pair, will update his beliefs toward the following posterior
probabilities:
(V |f) =
(1 - ^
y)(1 - p)
(1 - ^
x)p + (1 - ^
y)(1 - p)

1
2
and
(V |v) =
^
y(1 - p)
p^
x + ^
y(1 - p)

2
As a specific situation emerging in the one-receiver KG case, optimality requires
that the first Bayes' rule has a zero numerator and updating is impossible. Still, the
posterior probability is derived from the second Bayes' rule, solving optimally18
p^
x + (1 - p)^
y = 2(1 - p)^
y.
What differs in our model from those of KG and Wang (2011) is that each single
investor updates his own beliefs based on individual priors. That is, because we
consider a large number of investors with heterogenous prior beliefs, the magnitude
(but not the direction) of Bayesian updating also differs among investors. Formally
this may be written as follows. First, - as in KG (2011), Wang (2011) and Sobel
(2010) - let b
(|d) denote the posterior belief of an investor with individual prior
realization b that the true state of the banking sector is  when the supervisor
discloses d and applies a stress test design {|·}
. In particular the posteriors for
any prior belief b are:
b
(V |v) = (v|V )·b
(v|V )b+(v|F)(1-b)
b

when the supervisor discloses d = v and d = f, respectively. As a consequence,
Bayesian updating will affect the cumulative distribution function of investors' be-
liefs. The following subsection describes how the stress test design {|·}
and the
stress test outcome d jointly affect investor beliefs.
2.4.2 Distribution of investors' posterior beliefs and uncertainty
Since the stress test design {|·}
is public information and does not depend on
the prior belief of any single investor, the outcome of the stress tests will affect beliefs
of all investors to the same direction. Consider the borderline case in which a stress
test is completely uninformative. That is, it must be true that b
(V |v) = b
(V |f)
and b
(F|v) = b
(F|f) for any b and (v|V ) = (f|V ) = (v|F) = (f|F) = 1
2
.19
Now, making the stress test informative - i.e. setting (v|V ) > 1
2
and/or (f|F) >
1
2
- works as follows:20
(v|V ) > 1
2
 b
(V |v) > b
(V |f) and b
(F|f) > b
(F|v)  b
where the last part follows from (f|V ) = 1-(v|V ) and the definition of posterior
beliefs (2) above. Moreover, perfectly analogously and using the same reasoning we
now observe the following:
(f|F) > 1
2
 b
(F|f) > b
(F|v) and b
(V |v) > b
(V |f)  b.
In a next step, let x  [0, 1
2
] and y  [0, 1
2
] denote the level of precision ­ ie the
amount by which (v|V ) and (f|F) exceed 1
2
­ of the signal d = v and d = f,
respectively.
These observations already lead to two results. First, although the supervisor
can decide about the precision of a certain signal, i.e. d = v and d = f, basically
separately, there is an interaction between both. This interaction will make signals
19Note that (V |v) = (V |f) and (F|v) = (F|f) both require
(v|F)
(v|V )
=
(f|F)
(f|V )
.
Due to (v|V ) = 1 - (f|V ) and (v|F) = 1 - (f|F) the former condition holds if and only if
(v|V ) = (f|V ) = (v|F) = (f|F) = 1
2
.
20While (v|V ) < 1
2
may occur, we limit our attention to the case with (v|V ) > 1
2
in the
case of informative disclosure. The reason is twofold: first, (v|V ) > 1
2
refers to a situation of
truthful disclosure, which directly translates into investor utility. Second, (v|V ) < 1
2
simply
means that the supervisor is likely to send a signal that is exactly the opposite of the true state.
Since investors will know the disclosure mechanism, this supervisory strategy will cause investors
to decide inversely.
10
reinforce each other in terms of their precision. As a consequence, posterior beliefs
are driven by the precision of both signals as well as their interaction. The second
result is that the relations hold for any arbitrary prior investor belief b.
This gives the model the following interesting twist: when the supervisor's dis-
closure mechanism is informative, the public signal d  D will crucially affect the
cumulative distribution function of posterior beliefs. Therefore, let ^
Gv
(·) and ^
Gf
(·)
denote the cumulative distribution functions of posterior beliefs in the case of signals
d = v and d = f, respectively. Further, for any b, let us denote ^
bv
(b) = b
(V |v)
and ^
bf
(b) = b
(V |f) as the respective posterior beliefs that the banking sector is
vulnerable when signals d = v and d = f are observable. Then, for any b, the above
arguments imply:
(v|V ) > 1
2
 ^
bv
(b)  b and ^
bf
(b) < b  b (3)
 ^
Gv
(b)  G(b) and ^
Gf
(b) > G(b)  b. (4)
and
(f|F) > 1
2
 ^
bf
(b)  b and ^
bv
(b) > b  b (5)
 ^
Gf
(b)  G(b) and ^
Gv
(b) < G(b)  b. (6)
In words: an informative disclosure mechanism increases or decreases the beliefs of
any single investor relative to his priors, depending on the disclosed signal ­ this is
what (3) and (5) reveal. As a result, we have for the aggregate setting, depending
on the supervisor's signal, that information disclosure now shifts mass to the left
tail or to the right tail of the cumulative distribution function ­ see (4) and (6). We
summarize these findings as follows:
Lemma 1 Informative disclosure by the supervisor shifts the cumulative distribu-
tion function of investors' beliefs in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance
(FSD). The signal v (f) deteriorates (improves) the cumulative distribution function
of investor beliefs in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance (FSD) compared
to the prior distribution.
Proof: See the appendix.
Note in particular that the FSD shift of the cumulative distribution functions
may be formally written as
 ^
Gv
(b|x, y)
x
 0 and
 ^
Gv
(b|x, y)
y
< 0 b (7)
 ^
Gf
(b|x, y)
x
> 0 and
 ^
Gf
(b|x, y)
y
 0 b. (8)
11
The FSD shift and the finding that the direction of the FSD shift depends on
the stress test outcome d have an important implication regarding the supervisor's
decision environment: Implementing an informative stress testing mechanism re-
places the certain decision-making situation of the supervisor with an uncertain one.
Recall that the supervisor does not know the true state of the banking sector at
the time when he decides on the optimal stress testing mechanism. Therefore, the
supervisor faces uncertainty about the signal to be sent to investors in a later stage
of the game. In the case of an uninformative stress testing mechanism this fact,
however, is irrelevant for the supervisor. In this latter case, investors will decide
based on their prior beliefs, which implies that the supervisor knows the number of
prudent investors with certainty. In contrast, in a situation of informative disclosure
the stress test outcome d determines the direction the investors' beliefs shift and, as
a result, the number of prudent investors. As the stress test outcome d is unknown
at the time when the stress test mechanism is designed, the supervisor creates an
environment of uncertainty regarding the effective number of prudent investors.
To summarize: when designing an informative disclosure mechanism, the supervi-
sor actually replaces a certain decision-making situation with an uncertain decision-
making situation (disclosure lottery). Whether this is valuable depends on both
the supervisor's utility function and the level of expected utility generated by the
disclosure lottery, relative to the utility of the certain situation with uninformative
disclosure. In what follows, we analyze this property in great detail.
2.4.3 Investor decisions
Investors, in general, have to choose an action out of their action space A = {P, R}
in order to maximize individual expected utility. Let, as a general representation,
Pri
(V ) and Pri
(F) denote the individual probabilities (beliefs) of an arbitrary in-
vestor i that the true state of the banking system is vulnerable (V ) or firm (F).
Then investor i's expected utility of choosing prudent behavior (a = P) or risky
behavior (a = R) is
E (UR
(a = P)) = Pri
(V )UR
(P, V ) + Pri
(F)UR
(P, F) = Pri
(V ) (9)
or
E (UR
(a = R)) = Pri
(V )UR
(R, V ) + Pri
(F)UR
(R, F) = Pri
(F), (10)
respectively, because of UR
(P, V ) = UR
(R, F) = 1 and UR
(P, F) = UR
(R, V ) = 0.
From expected utilities (9) and (10) it is easily verified that an arbitrary investor
i is indifferent between a = P and a = R if and only if Pri
(V ) = Pri
(F) = 1
2
. As
a consequence, any investor who believes that Pri
(V )  1
2
will choose a = R, and
any investor who thinks that Pri
(V ) > 1
2
will choose a = P. In other words: the
threshold probability bT
that we mentioned earlier, which defines when investors
12
switch from a risky to a prudent strategy is unambiguously
bT
= 1
2
.
Specifically, it is irrelevant in this context whether investors revert to their prior
beliefs for decision making or whether they update and build posterior beliefs. The
mode of decision making is unaffected by setting Pri
(V ) = b, Pri
(V ) = ^
bv
(b), or
Pri
(V ) = ^
bf
(b). Therefore, it must be true that bT
= 1
2
is constant, regardless of
the information disclosed by the supervisor.
Supervisory information disclosure, however, may affect the level of expected
investor utility. In the previous subsection (Lemma 1) we found that an informative
disclosure mechanism causes ^
bv
(b)  b  b when the supervisor sends a signal d = v,
and ^
bf
(b)  b  b when the supervisor's signal is d = f. That is, in the case
where d = v, any investor's expected utility when deciding prudently increases,
compared to the situation without supervisory information disclosure. Instead, when
supervisor sends d = f, any investor's expected utility of prudent behavior will
decrease. Therefore, on one hand, investors may prefer to adjust their investment
decisions according to the signal received. The supervisor, on the other, is able to
affect the investors' expected utility and their choice of actions in the desired way
by applying an optimally designed disclosure mechanism.
2.4.4 Bayesian Plausibility and the value of informative disclosure
The standard persuasion literature, which considers games with a single sender and a
single receiver, argues that Bayesian Plausibility (BP) is the only restriction imposed
on a sender's mechanism.21 This implies that the expected posteriors must be equal
to the objective probability of a specific situation, in an immediate and simple way,
as already illustrated in the digression above.
The present model now adds a special twist to the basic setup: with an infinitely
large number of investors and with heterogenous prior beliefs, we are now able to
generalize BP to find an equilibrium condition. This becomes evident by taking a
closer look at the formal representation of BP for the single investor (receiver) case:
b
(V |v)Pr(v) + b
(V |f)Pr(f) = p (11)
with Pr(v) = (v|V ) · p + (v|F) · (1 - p) and Pr(f) = (f|V ) · p + (f|F) · (1 - p).
Although (11) is written for an arbitrary realization b of investors' prior beliefs,
it can be shown that (11) does not hold for all (heterogenous) b simultaneously.
21See Sobel (2010), p. 20, and Kamenica and Gentzkow (2011), p. 2596.
13
Calculating the posterior beliefs and taking into account the previous definition of
precision of the supervisor's disclosure mechanism, we can rewrite (11)22
(1
2
+ x) b
1
2
- (y - p(x + y))
1
2
- (y - b(x + y))
+ (1
2
- x) b
1
2
+ (y - p(x + y))
1
2
+ (y - b(x + y))
= p. (12)
Recall that in the basic persuasion model of KG, Bayesian Plausibility (11) re-
quires that posterior beliefs need to be unbiased in expected terms. That is, for a
persuasion mechanism to work properly, the sender needs to make sure that be-
liefs are not distorted in a way such that receivers would suffer a welfare loss from
acting according to information disclosed. Note that the left-hand side of (11) - ie
b
(V |v)Pr(v) + b
(V |f)Pr(f) - represents the (single) receiver's expected utility in
the case of prudent behavior.23 If persuasion increases (decreases) this term beyond
(below) the objective probability p, prudent behavior becomes more (less) attractive
for a (single) investor. However, due to the distortion, an investor will find himself
ex post too often in a situation where his initial decision proves to be incorrect. The
receiver then realizes UR
(P, F) = 0 or UR
(R, V ) = 0 instead of UR
(P, V ) = 1 or
UR
(R, F) = 1 ­ compared to decision-making based on prior beliefs when ignoring
the supervisor's information.
However - and here we differ from the literature such as Wang's (2011) voting
model - this cannot hold for every single investor when there are many investors
with heterogenous prior beliefs and when the supervisor's disclosure mechanism is
publicly known, i.e. (x, y) stays the same for all investors. In this situation (11) -
or (12) for our particular situation - can only hold for an investor whose prior belief
b is exactly identical to the objective probability p of a vulnerable banking sector.
That is, except for this latter investor, individual prior beliefs of all other investors
will appear more or less distorted compared to the objective probability p.
For instance, all investors with b < (>)p believe that the probability of a vulner-
able banking sector is lower (higher) than p. For all these "distorted" investors, an
informative disclosure mechanism may correct their individual distortions to some
22Due to previous definitions we have:

(V |v) =

14
degree. Put differently: an informative disclosure mechanism of the supervisor gen-
erates expected posterior beliefs that are higher (lower) than the individual priors
of investors in the case of b < p (b > p). We so state and prove
Lemma 2 Bayesian Plausibility in our model with multiple investors (receivers)
and heterogenous investor prior beliefs requires
b
(V |v)Pr(v) + b
(V |f)Pr(f) = p  b = p.
Proof: See the Appendix.
From the investors' point of view information disclosure suggests that their indi-
vidual priors understate or overstate the probability of a vulnerable banking sector
in the case of b < p or b > p, respectively:
(1
2
+ x) b
1
2
- (y - p(x + y))
1
2
- (y - b(x + y))
+ (1
2
- x) b

2
+ (y - p(x + y))
1
2
+ (y - b(x + y))
> b  b < p(13)
or
(1

2
- (y - p(x + y))

2
- (y - b(x + y))
+ (1
2
- x) b
1
2
+ (y - p(x + y))
1
2
+ (y - b(x + y))
< b  b > p.
(14)
For these "distorted" investors, the supervisor's disclosure mechanism now corrects
(part of) this distortion of prior beliefs in a way that investor beliefs move toward the
true probability of a vulnerable banking sector. As a consequence, information disclo-
sure helps investors to make correct investment decisions. Against this background,
the value of an informative disclosure mechanism for investors becomes evident:
Corollary 3 A disclosure mechanism that is Bayesian plausible according to Lemma
2 raises the expected utility of investors whose prior beliefs deviate from the objective
probability of a vulnerable banking sector.
Proof: Note that the left-hand side of (12) represents an investor's expected
utility from behaving prudently, acting according to the supervisor's information
disclosure, and having prior belief b. Under a Bayesian plausible disclosure mech-
anism, then, from the proof of Lemma 2 it is immediately clear that informative
disclosure by the supervisor increases the expected utility of prudent behavior for
all investors who understate the probability of the banking sector being vulnerable
(b < p). That is, informative disclosure better aligns the evaluations of latter in-
vestors with the true state of the banking system. Moreover, informative disclosure
causes investors with b
(V |v)  1
2
> b to switch from a risky to a prudent investment
strategy.
15
The opposite effect appears to be the case with investors whose priors overstate
the true vulnerability of the banking sector. Their expected utility from prudent
behavior decreases under a Bayesian plausible disclosure mechanism (see proof of
Lemma 2). As a result, investors with b
(V |v) < 1
2
 b switch from a prudent to a
risky investment strategy.
For both situations, the proof of Lemma 2 (see Appendix B) shows that under
a Bayesian-plausible disclosure mechanism the expected utility of those investors,
which change their investment strategy in response to supervisory disclosure, will
increase.
In other words, under a Bayesian plausible disclosure mechanism, "distorted"
investors' expected utility will increase when they base their decisions on supervisory
information instead of prior beliefs. This result is novel to the literature on the
disclosure of supervisory information in the banking sector.
3 Optimal disclosure
We now turn to optimality analysis. We now ask whether the supervisor should
optimally implement an informative stress testing (disclosure) mechanism. For this
purpose, we first state the supervisor's optimization problem before, and then the
existence of an informative disclosure mechanism, to derive some welfare implica-
tions.
3.1 The supervisor's problem
The supervisor's goal is to maximize his utility while taking into account all the
factors that were analyzed in the previous sections. Note that the supervisor's
utility function, has a unique maximum when the number of prudent investors is
exactly |P|max. Therefore, when the supervisor finds himself in a situation where
the investors' prior beliefs result in24
|P|max = 1 - G(1
2
),
the supervisor will refrain from implementing any informative disclosure mechanism
as this cannot increase his utility.
In the following we consider situations when prior beliefs generate numbers of
prudent investors which deviate from |P|max. In this context there are two possibil-
ities: either we have 1-G(1
2
) < |P|max (case a)) or we have 1-G(1
2
) > |P|max (case
24Note that in section 2.4.3 we argued that the unique threshold when investors switch from a
risky to a prudent investment strategy is bT
= 1
2
.
16
b)). Against this background the supervisor's objective is to design an informa-
tive disclosure mechanism ­ by choosing x and y ­ such that the distance between
the supervisor's maximum utility and the expected utility realized by informative
disclosure is minimized:
min

 Pr(v) Umax

with Pr(v) = (1

Pr(f) = (1
2
- x) p + (1
2
+ y) (1 - p) (15)
x, y  (0, 1
2
).
Recall that, in optimization problem (15), Umax
S
denotes the supervisor's maximum
possible utility, which is achieved when 1 - G(1
2
) = |P|max. Furthermore 1 - ^
Gv
(1
2
)
and 1 - ^
Gf
(1
2
) denote the number of prudent investors when the supervisor sends
signals d = v and d = f, respectively. Bayesian Plausibility is implicitly considered
in the cumulative distribution functions of the investors' posterior beliefs ^
Gv
(·) and
^
Gf
(·).25
3.2 Optimality of informative disclosure

The following considerations, which are essential to our analysis, build on a num-
ber of insights regarding cumulative distribution functions ^
Gv
and ^
Gf
to which we
refer in great detail in section 2.4.2 as well as in the Appendix. First, it should
be noted that the numbers of prudent investors are determined by the cumulative
distribution functions of prior and posterior beliefs and that ­ due to the features
of these functions ­ the following relation always holds:
1 - ^
Gf
(1

)  1 - G(1
2
)  1 - ^
Gv
(1

).

We are now able to derive the following lemma from the first-order necessary
conditions (16) and (17):
Lemma 4 It is never optimal for the supervisor to implement an informative dis-
closure mechanism that either shifts 1 - ^
Gv
(1
2
) beyond |P|max in case a), i.e. in the
case when 1 - G(1
2
) < |P|max, or that shifts 1 - ^
Gf
(1
2
) below |P|max in case b), i.e.
in the case when 1 - G(1
2
) > |P|max.
In words: it is not optimal for the supervisor to disclose information in a way that in
the case of a signal d = f the number of prudent investors is below |P|max, whereas
in the case of the signal d = v the number of prudent investors is beyond |P|max.
Proof: Assume, to the contrary, that the informative disclosure mechanism causes
1 - ^
Gf
(1
2
) < |P|max and 1 - ^
Gv
(1
2
) > |P|max. This implies U
S
(1 - ^
Gf
(1
2
)) > 0 and
U
S
(1 - ^
Gv
(1
2
)) < 0. Then, for the first-order condition (16) to hold
Umax
S
- US
(1 - ^
Gv
(1
2
)) < Umax
S
- US
(1 - ^
Gf
(1
2
))
is required to hold because of relations (19) and Pr(v), Pr(f) > 0.
Analogous reasoning for the other first-order condition (17), reveals that this
holds only if
Umax
S
- US
(1 - ^
Gv
(1
2
)) > Umax
S
- US
(1 - ^
Gf
(1
2
)),
a contradiction. Therefore, it must be true that an optimal disclosure mechanism
ensures 1 - ^
Gf
(1
2
)  1 - ^
Gv
(1
2
)  |P|max in case of 1 - G(1
2
) < |P|max and |P|max 
1 - ^
Gf
(1
2
)  1 - ^
Gv
(1
2
) in case of 1 - G(1
2
) > |P|max.
Building on the above lemma, we now state our main result in the following propo-
sition:
Proposition 1 In either case, i.e. in case a) as well as in case b), there exists an
unique optimum (x, y) with 0 < x, y < 1
2
. In other words, in the case where
18
1 - G(1
2
) < |P|max as well as in the case where 1 - G(1
2
) > |P|max there exists
an informative (but not fully revealing) disclosure mechanism that minimizes the
distance between the supervisor's maximum utility and the expected utility arising
from informative disclosure.
Proof: Consider case a) first. If the disclosure mechanism is informative, it is
easy to see that by the first result above we have 1 - ^
Gf
(1
2
) < 1 - G(1
2
) < 1 -
^
Gv
(1

then, ranked US

For case b) the proof is analogous to the that of case a). The only difference with
the previous case is that the relationships between terms are reversed and marginal

)), U
S
(1 - ^
Gf
(1
2
)) < 0.
Lastly, it follows immediately from Lemma 1 that the optimal disclosure mech-
anism cannot be fully revealing, ie (x, y) = (1
2
, 1
2
): a fully revealing disclosure
mechanism implies that 1 - ^
Gf
(1
2
) = 0 < |P|max and 1 - ^
Gv
(1
2
) = 1 > |P|max. Using
Lemma 1, it is easy to see that this cannot be optimal.
19
In the previous analysis we have excluded corner solutions, limiting p to values of
less then 1. Our former results are valid as long as there is no crisis going on in the
banking sector. For the case when the banking sector is hurt by a systemic crisis, we
can easily show that the supervisor will not anymore apply an informative disclosure
mechanism. When the banking sector is hit by a crisis, the objective probability of
a vulnerable banking sector will approach unity.
To illustrate, let p = 1, from which Pr(v) = (v|V ) and Pr(f) = (f|F).
Moreover, using equation (2) we find that b
(V |v) = 1 and b
(V |f) = 1 for investors'
posterior beliefs when b = p = 1. Applying Bayesian Plausibility (equation (11) and
Lemma 2) now requires Pr(v) = (v|V ) = 1
2
and Pr(f) = (f|F) = 1
2
. This
implies that Pr(v) = (f|V ) = 1
2
and Pr(f) = (v|F) = 1
2
. The outcome in
case of an ongoing banking crisis is that the supervisor's disclosure will optimally
have to remain uninformative ­ a result perfectly in line with a number of recent
observations made during the subprime crisis of 2007-2009, as well as during the
sovereign crisis since 2010.26
3.3 Welfare
Our welfare implications follow immediately from Proposition 1 and Corollary 3. Re-
call that in Section 2 we argued that due to Bayesian Plausibility and the investors'
decision-making process, investors either gain from information disclosure or realize
at least the same utility as in a situation without informative disclosure. Moreover,
supervisors always gain as there exists an optimal informative disclosure mechanism
with 0 < x, y < 1
2
that minimizes the distance between the supervisor's maximum
possible utility (for a given objective probability p) and the expected utility arising
from informative disclosure, which has been shown above in section 3. In sum, total
welfare increases as a consequence of the supervisor's optimal information disclosure
mechanism.
4 Conclusion
The goal of this paper is to deliver a rationale for macro stress tests and to explain
why public supervisors use such a design. We so shed new light on the discussion
on transparency and financial stability, which is central to the current financial
debate. The paper has shown that disclosing two pieces of information, namely the
signal generating process together with a signal, permits institutional supervisors (or
banking authorities) to persuade investors (Bayesian receivers) to act in a welfare-
enhancing way. Our paper shows that to optimally design a stress test (disclosure)
26See Horvath and Vasco (2012).
20
mechanism for a continuum of investors, public supervisors will recur to a variety
of stress tests and disclose their information to the public, to capture the varying
performance of the underlying banking sector.
The disclosure mechanism that we offer reveals some attractive features. It shows
a unique interior optimum plus other valuable properties that permit a novel expla-
nation why disclosure processes in the banking sector are designed the way they are.
Specifically, our results tell practitioners that the design of disclosure mechanisms
such as macro stress tests will induce Bayesian investors to update their beliefs in a
direction consistent with the banking authority. In addition, we have shown that for
the borderline case of a systemic crisis, disclosure should be optimally uninformative.
While our results are robust and applicable to a wider range of real-world situ-
ations, it seems worthwhile to mention related research that this paper may open
up and complement, while pointing out differences that may lead to new avenues of
research. Note first that in our model, and different from Wang (2012), disclosure is
always welfare enhancing. Typically, in our multi-receiver setting and different from
KG, the sender will never use a value of zero for one of the parameters x and y.
That is, every signal carries additional information. With one of the two parameters
set to zero, information would only be conveyed indirectly as solely the remaining
parameter can change the distribution of posterior beliefs.
Our setting can also be extended to include banks as players, which may then be
differentiated along a new (type-) dimension. In such a model, the supervisor would
become the middleman. One possible advantage of such a setup would consist in the
option to segment the investment market according to bank types and investor types,
involving even more differentiated disclosure processes handled by the supervisor.
Needless to say, such a treatment would come at the cost of reduced tractability.
Given the already high degree of complexity that we have reached so far, we will
leave this avenue, as well, for future research.
A Proof of Lemma 1: FSD shift of investor beliefs

Consider the posteriors of any investor with any prior belief b
^

(b) = b
(V |v) =
(1

(1

(1

+ y) (1 - b)
where we used the notion of signal precision as defined in section 2.4.2. Changing
the precision parameters x  [0, 1
2
] and y  [0, 1
2
], the mechanism has the following
21
general effect on posterior beliefs:
^

y
= -
(1
2

[(1

2
+ y) (1 - b)]2
 0
where the first and the last line become equal to zero when y = 1
2
and x = 1
2
,
respectively. As a result, a higher level of x implies, ceteris paribus, ^
bv
(b)  b and
^
bf
(b) < b for any b whereas a higher level of y implies, ceteris paribus, ^
bv
(b) > b and
^
bf
(b)  b for any b. That is, from a formal perspective the disclosure mechanism
(D, {|·}
) is a monotonic transformation of investor beliefs.27
Let us now denote ^
gv
(b) and ^
gf
(b) the distribution functions of investors' posterior
beliefs when the supervisor sends d = v and d = f, respectively. Given the impact
of the signaling mechanism on investor beliefs above, the distribution functions of
posteriors can be determined to be:
^
gv
(b) : ^
bv
(b) - g(b)  b (20)
^
gf
(b) : ^
bf
(b) - g(b)  b. (21)
The corresponding cumulative distribution functions are, by definition,
^
Gv
() =

0
^
gv
(^
bv
(b))d^
bv
(b)
^
Gf
() =

0
^
gf
(^
bf
(b))d^
bf
(b).
Applying the definitions of ^
bv
(b) and ^
bf
(b) above allows for the calculation of these
cumulative distribution functions based on the distribution of prior beliefs:
^
Gv
() =
(1
2
-y)
(1
2
+x)(1-)+(1
2
-y)
0
g(b)db (22)
^
Gf
() =
(1
2
+y)
(1
2
-x)(1-)+(1
2
+y)
0
g(b)db. (23)
27Note that x and y reinforce each other regarding the impact on investor posteriors when a
certain signal is received.
22
Equations (20) and (21) show first that x  [0, 1
2
] and y  [0, 1
2
] represent param-
eters which determine the upper limit of the integrals. Therefore the cumulative
distributions may be considered to be conditional on x and y, denoted
^
Gv
()  ^
Gv
(|x, y) and ^
Gf
()  ^
Gf
(|x, y)  .
Second, the impact of x and y on the cumulative distributions of posteriors at any
  [0, 1] can be determined by calculating the partial derivatives:
 ^
Gv
(|x, y)
x
= -g
(1
2

(1

where die inequalities follow from g(·) > 0, x, y  [0, 1

B Proof of Lemma 2: Bayesian Plausibility
Let bBP
denote the prior belief of the investor for which (12) holds.
Consider the situation b < bBP
first. For a given decision (x, y) of the supervisor
we observe y - b(x + y) > y - bBP
(x + y) which implies 1
2
- (y - b(x + y)) <
1
2
- (y - bBP
(x + y)) and 1
2
+ (y - b(x + y)) > 1
2
+ (y - bBP
(x + y)). For the fraction
terms in (12) we therefore find
1
2
- (y - p(x + y))
1
2
- (y - b(x + y))
>
1
2
- (y - p(x + y))
1
2
- (y - bBP
(x + y))
and
1
2
+ (y - p(x + y))
1
2
+ (y - b(x + y))
<
1
2
+ (y - p(x + y))
1
2
+ (y - bBP
(x + y))
.
Since (1
2
+ x) b  (1
2
- x) b ­ and note that b  [0, 1] and x  [0, 1
2
] ­ we have
(1
2
+ x) b
1
2
- (y - p(x + y))
1
2
- (y - b(x + y))
+ (1
2
- x) b
1
2
+ (y - p(x + y))
1
2
+ (y - b(x + y))
> b  b < bBP
.
Regarding the situation b > bBP
the arguments are analogous but the previous
relations turn in the opposite direction. That is, for a given decision (x, y) we
23
observe y - b(x + y) < y - bBP
(x + y), 1
2
- (y - b(x + y)) > 1
2
- (y - bBP
(x + y)) and
1
2
+ (y - b(x + y)) < 1
2
+ (y - bBP
(x + y)). As a consequence the relations between
the fraction terms in (12) are:
1
2
- (y - p(x + y))
1
2
- (y - b(x + y))
<
1
2
- (y - p(x + y))
1
2
- (y - bBP
(x + y))
and
1
2
+ (y - p(x + y))
1
2
+ (y - b(x + y))
>
1
2
+ (y - p(x + y))
1
2
+ (y - bBP
(x + y))
.
With (1
2
+ x) b  (1
2
- x) b we finally have in the current situation:
(1
2
+ x) b
1
2
- (y - p(x + y))
1
2
- (y - b(x + y))
+ (1
2
- x) b
1
2
+ (y - p(x + y))
1
2
+ (y - b(x + y))
< b  b > bBP
.
Moreover, the above arguments actually prove that bBP
= p is the only feasible
opportunity to make persuasion work: Note that for (x, y) = (0, 0) Bayesian Plausi-
bility (12) holds for any possible b. This is trivial because (x, y) = (0, 0) means that
the disclosure mechanism is completely non-informative and investors' posteriors are
equivalent to their prior beliefs.
Conversely, in the case where (x, y) = (0, 0) it is easily verified that Bayesian
Plausibility (to reach a high degree of transparency) holds if and only if
1
2
- (y - p(x + y))
1
2
- (y - b(x + y))
=
1
2
+ (y - p(x + y))
1
2
+ (y - b(x + y))
which requires b = p to hold. In words: in the current context Bayesian Plausi-
bility needs to be met only for an investor whose prior belief b equals the objective
probability for a vulnerable banking sector p.
C Bayesian Plausibility in the supervisor's opti-
mization problem

Plausibility constraint (BP):

tion problem, hence, does not affect the relevant first-order necessary conditions for
the optimum. Rather, calculations show that the probability distributions already
comprise the crucial features of (BP).
