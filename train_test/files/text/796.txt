ABSTRACT
Most estimates of osteoporosis in older U.S. adults have been based on its occurrence in white women, even though
it is known to affect men and minority women. In the present study, we used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
measurements of femoral bone mineral density (BMD) from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III, 1988­1994) to estimate the overall scope of the disease in the older U.S. population.
Specifically, we estimate prevalences of low femoral BMD in women 50 years and older and explore different
approaches for defining low BMD in older men in that age range. Low BMD levels were defined in accordance with
an approach proposed by an expert panel of the World Health Organization and used BMD data from 382
non-Hispanic white (NHW) men or 409 NHW women ages 20­29 years from the NHANES III dataset. For women,
estimates indicate 13­18%, or 4­6 million, have osteoporosis (i.e., BMD >2.5 standard deviations [SD] below the
mean of young NHW women) and 37­50%, or 13­17 million, have osteopenia (BMD between 1 and 2.5 SD below
the mean of young NHW women). For men, these numbers depend on the gender of the reference group used to
define cutoff values. When based on male cutoffs, 3­6% (1­2 million) of men have osteoporosis and 28­47% (8­13
million) have osteopenia; when based on female cutoffs, 1­4% (280,000­1 million) have osteoporosis and 15­33%
(4­9 million) have osteopenia. Most of the older U.S. adults with low femur BMD are women, but, regardless of
which cutoffs are used, the number of men is substantial. (J Bone Miner Res 1997;12:1761­1768)
INTRODUCTION
OSTEOPOROTIC HIP FRACTURE remains a major public
health concern in the United States. Although the
etiology of osteoporotic fractures is multifactorial, bone
mineral density (BMD) has been identified as one of the
primary predictive risk factors.(1­3) Based on this fact, an
expert panel of the World Health Organization (WHO)
recently proposed diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis based
on bone density.(4,5) The applicability of these criteria to
groups other than white women is not certain; but osteo-
porosis is not only a disease of white women.(6,7) For ex-
ample, of the 281,000 hospital discharges for hip fracture
among persons age 45 years and older in the U.S in 1994,
74,000, or 26%, were men (personal communication, Dr.
W. Edward Bacon). The proportion of men may increase in
the future because the hip fracture incidence rate in U.S.
men appears to be going up over time, while rates in women
may have plateaued.(8,9)

We recently estimated the prevalence of older U.S.
women with low femoral BMD using the WHO diagnostic
criteria in conjunction with femoral BMD data collected in
the first 3-year national sample of the third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).(10) We
included estimates for nonwhite women from two minority
groups with BMD values that fell below cutoffs based on
white women. Since that time, the second 3-year national
sample of NHANES III has been completed. In this paper,
we update the estimates of osteoporosis in older U.S.
women, including minority women, using the full 6 years of
NHANES III. In addition, we explore the application of the
WHO criteria to older U.S. men.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data source
Estimates of low femoral bone density are based on data
collected in NHANES III. The NHANES are conducted
periodically by the National Center for Health Statistics,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to assess the
health and nutritional status of the civilian noninstitution-
alized population of the United States. NHANES III is a
6-year study (1988­1994) divided into two 3-year national
probablity samples: phase 1 (1988­1991) and phase 2
(1991­1994). Both phases were designed to be separate
national probability samples. The survey uses a stratified,
multistage probability design to select the sample and has
been described in detail elsewhere.(11)
All men and nonpregnant women age 20 years and older
were eligible for bone densitometry unless they had fractured
both hips previously. Bone mineral measurements were per-
formed on 14,646 men and women age 20 years and older in
the full survey. This represents 63% of the eligible selected
sample, 78% of the eligible interviewed sample, and 88% of
the eligible examined sample. The left hip was scanned unless
there was a history of previous fracture or surgery; only 1%
received a scan of the right femur. Because their inclusion
did not alter prevalence estimates, those who received a
scan of the right femur were included in the analyses.
Prevalences were estimated for men and women age 50
years and older because the predictive relationship between
fracture and femur BMD has been studied exclusively in
older persons.(1­3) Bone mineral measurements were per-
formed on 3176 older men in NHANES III, but 86, or 3%,
were rejected for technical reasons after review, leaving 3090
with acceptable data. Of the 3379 women age 50 years and
older who received scans, 68, or 2%, were rejected, leaving
3311 with acceptable BMD data. The race/ethnic composi-
tion of the sample of older persons with acceptable BMD
data for men and women, respectively, was 1723 and 1880
non-Hispanic whites (NHW), 647 and 695 non-Hispanic
blacks (NHB), and 625 and 600 Mexican Americans (MA).
Race and ethnic categories were based on self-reported
data using U.S. Census Bureau definitions. There were too
few persons of other race and ethnic groups (n  95 and
136 older men and women, respectively) to report preva-
lences separately for these groups, although they were in-
cluded in estimates for the total population.
Bone density measurements
BMD of the proximal femur was measured using dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at five regions of
interest. In this study, we present data on four regions:
femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter, and total femur.
Data for the fifth region, Ward's triangle, was not included
because (1) it represents a calculated area of low bone
density rather than a true anatomic region; (2) Ward's
triangle data from the two phases of NHANES III are not
directly comparable due to software changes that allowed
the location of Ward's triangle to vary in phase 1, but fixed
it midcervically in phase 2; and (3) it had a larger in vivo
measurement error (5%) than the other regions (2­3%).(12)
Three densitometers (Hologic QDR 1000; Waltham, MA,
U.S.A.), located in mobile examination centers, were used
to obtain the measurements. A rigorous quality control
(QC) program, including use of anthropomorphic phan-
toms and review of each QC and respondent scan at a
central site, was used throughout the study to ensure data
quality. QC results for the first phase of NHANES III have
been published elsewhere(12); QC results from the second
phase were similar to those for phase 1.
Definition of low bone density
The WHO diagnostic criteria for osteopenia and osteo-
porosis(4,5) were used to define low bone density among
men and women age 50 years and older. This approach
defines cutoff values using BMD data from a young adult
reference group. The WHO criteria did not specify details
about the reference group in terms of age, race, or gender.
NHW men or women between 20 and 29 years of age were
used as the reference group in the present study because
there are prospective data indicating that bone loss occurs
at the femur in women during their 30s.(13) In addition, the
International Committee for Standards in Bone Densitom-
etry recently chose the 20­29 year age range as the refer-
ence range for standardizing cutoffs between different bone
densitometry instruments (personal communication, Dr.
Peter Steiger). Of the scans performed on the young white
men (n  388) and women (n  415), all but six scans
(1.5%), excluded for technical reasons in each group, were
used for the reference group. For each of the four regions
of interest, low bone density was defined as: (1) osteopenia:
a BMD value between 1 standard deviation (SD) and 2.5
SD below the mean of white men or women age 20­29
years; and (2) osteoporosis: a BMD value 2.5 SD below
the young reference mean.
These cutoff points were applied to minority men and
women in this study as well as to NHWs because data on the
predictive utility of femur BMD for hip fracture in non-
whites is lacking to date. In addition, estimates for men
were made using cutoffs derived from both the young male
and female reference groups, since currently there are in-
sufficient data to identify clearly the most appropriate ap-
proach for men.

Data analysis
Sampling weights were used to calculate prevalence esti-
mates and to account for oversampling and nonresponse to
the household interview and physical examination. The
sampling weights for phases 1 and 2 were based on the
March 1990 and March 1993 Current Population Survey
values for the civilian noninstitutionalized population, both
adjusted for undercounts.(14) All analyzes were performed
using SUDAAN.(15)
Both unadjusted and age-adjusted prevalences of low
BMD among men and women age 50 years and older were
calculated by race and ethnic group. Unadjusted preva-
lences were used to calculate the number of men and
women with low BMD in the U.S., while age-adjusted
prevalences were used for comparison of prevalences be-
tween genders and race/ethnic groups, since bone density is
related to age(16) and the age structure of the different
gender and race/ethnic groups varies in the U.S. population.
Prevalences were age-adjusted using the direct method to
the age distribution of the 1980 population.
RESULTS
Mean BMD, SDs, range of BMD, and the cut-off values
corresponding to the WHO diagnostic criteria for low bone
mass in the four regions of interest for the reference group
of young white men and women are shown in Table 1.
Updated prevalences of osteopenia and osteoporosis in
women in the four femur regions using the WHO diagnostic
criteria are shown by population in Table 2. Estimates of
osteopenia in older women ranged from 37 to 50%, or
13­17 million women, while osteoporosis ranged from 13 to
18%, or 4­6 million. Prevalences of each condition were
higher in the femoral neck region than in the other femoral
regions. Age-adjusted prevalences of both osteopenia and
osteoporosis were higher in NHWs than in NHBs; preva-
lences in MAs were similar or slightly lower than in NHWs.
The ratio of age-adjusted prevalences in NHWs versus
NHBs ranged from 1.5 to 2.8, depending on the femoral
region and definition of low BMD used (data not shown).
Corresponding ratios of prevalences for NHWs versus MAs
ranged from 0.8 to 1.2.
Prevalences of osteopenia and osteoporosis in men of all
races based on male versus female cutoff values are shown
in Table 3. Prevalences of osteopenia were noticably higher
when based on male cutoffs than female cutoffs, ranging
from 38 to 47%, compared with 15­33%. However, preva-
lences of osteoporosis were only slightly higher when based
on male versus female cutoffs.
When age-adjusted prevalences in men and women are
compared, the female-to-male ratios were 1.1­1.6 for os-
teopenia when prevalence in men was based on male cutoffs
and 1.5­2.8 when based on female cutoffs (data not shown).
For osteoporosis, the female-to-male ratios were 2.7­4.3
when using male cutoffs for men and 4­7.5 when using
female cutoffs.
Patterns of osteopenia and osteoporosis by race or eth-
nicity in men using the two sets of cutoffs are compared
with the patterns seen in women as shown in Fig. 1. The
pattern for osteopenia is similar in men and women regard-
less of the cutoff used in men, with NHWs of both genders
having the highest prevalences, followed by MAs, and
NHBs having the lowest prevalences. The prevalences of
osteoporosis were also greatest in NHW men regardless of
the cutoff used. Prevalences of osteoporosis in men of
either minority group were so small that they did not
achieve statistical reliability, and so the pattern must be
interpreted with caution. It suggests, however, that, unlike
women, MA men may have a lower prevalence of osteopo-
rosis than NHB men.
DISCUSSION
A considerable number of noninstitutionalized older cit-
izens in the U.S. have low femoral bone density, as defined

by WHO diagnostic criteria.(4,5) For women, updated esti-
mates indicate 4­6 million have osteoporosis and 13­17
million have osteopenia. For men, these numbers depend
on whether male versus female cutoff values are used.
When based on male cutoffs, 1­2 million men have osteo-
porosis and 8­13 million have osteopenia; when based on
female cutoffs, 280,000­1 million have osteoporosis and
4­9 million have osteopenia. Regardless of which cutoffs
are used for men, the numbers are substantial.
The updated prevalences of osteopenia in women are
similar to those published previously using phase 1 data
only, while the updated prevalences of osteoporosis are
slightly lower.(10) The latter is a result of the larger SDs and
concomitantly lower osteoporosis cutoff values when based
on the larger reference group of 409 young NHW women.
By chance, the representative sample in phase 2 of the
survey included a small number of young women with BMD
values that exceeded the BMD range observed in phase 1.
This wider BMD distribution contributed to the larger SD
for the total sample of these young women. Because of the
larger sample sizes, we believe the updated prevalence
estimates are the most reliable estimates of osteoporosis
and osteopenia in women.
The definitions of low BMD used in this study were based
on the WHO diagnostic criteria.(4,5) These guidelines rep-
resent an important step in describing the extent and char-
acteristics of osteoporosis, but the panel was aware that the
guidelines had limitations and would likely change with
more experience. A major issue for the current study is the
application of the guidelines to men, since they were devel-
oped for women. The WHO panel noted that the criteria
likely should be modified for men, but there were insuffi-
cient data to do so. To firmly resolve the issue, prospective
data on the absolute risk of fracture at any given BMD level
in men must be obtained. In the absence of such data, the
panel suggested either applying female cutoffs to men or
using a more stringent criterion of 3­4 SD for osteoporosis
if cutoffs were based on a male reference group.
Our cross-sectional study can illustrate some of the issues
to be addressed in determining the appropriate definitions
of osteopenia and osteoporosis in men. For example, in our
sample of older men, 1.5% had BMD values more than 3
SD below the young men's mean, which suggests that this
criterion may be too stringent. When we used the 2.5 SD
criterion, the prevalence of femoral osteoporosis in older
men was similar regardless of the gender of the reference
group. This is probably because the osteoporosis cutoff
values fell in the tail of the BMD distribution of older men,
where small differences in cutoff values will not result in
adding or subtracting many individuals. Our estimates of
osteoporosis in older men using either male or female
cutoffs were similar in magnitude to the estimates of life-
time risk of hip fracture for men from other studies(17); this
type of similarity was cited by the WHO panel to support
the validity of the guidelines for women.(4,5) Until the ap-
propriate prospective data on fracture risk in men are
available, it seems reasonable to use the 2.5 SD criterion to
estimate prevalence of osteoporosis among older men in
the population. This approach for defining osteoporosis in
a population does not, however, constitute a clinical diag-
nostic criteria for men.
An interim definition of osteopenia for the male popu-
lation is not clear though, since prevalences of osteopenia
depended on the gender of the reference group used to
derive the cutoff values. When based on male cutoffs, the
prevalences of osteopenia in older men were almost as high
as those in older women, which may seem too high given the
lower fracture rate in men. When considering how to define
osteopenia in men, it may be pertinent to recall that this
category was defined for women primarily to identify those
in whom preventing further bone loss would be most use-
ful.(4,5) The gradient of risk between BMD and fracture is
continuous,(4,5) so men with osteopenia are likely to be at
some increased risk of developing osteoporosis compared
with men with higher BMD values. In addition, femoral
BMD also declines progressively with age in men.(18) Given
this, an osteopenia category in men may be useful to help
direct prevention efforts regardless of whether it is defined
by male or female cutoffs.
Other issues may be important to consider in defining
low bone mass for men. For example, uniform criteria for
men and women have been used for other disease risk
factors, such as hypercholesterolemia and hypertension.
The assumption of similar mechanisms, levels of risk, and
response to treatment in men and women is inherently
appealing and also provides clinical simplicity. However,

ican.

these considerations must be reconciled with factors that
may favor gender-specific cutoffs. For example, male frac-
ture cases have higher BMD levels than female fracture
cases(19 ­22); it is unclear, however, whether this finding
reflects a truly higher fracture risk for a given BMD in men
or simply that the entire male BMD distribution is higher
than that of women. Fracture risk at a given BMD level
might truly differ between genders because of differences in
skeletal loads from the larger male body mass or gender
differences in structure­resistance relationships.(23)
Alternatively, fracture risk in men could appear to differ
because areal bone density, as measured by DEXA, does
not completely account for the confounding effect of bone
size.(24) Young adult men and women have similar spinal
volumetric bone density, as measured by computed tomog-
raphy, but spinal areal bone density by DEXA is greater in
men.(23,24) At the femur, men have approximately 10%
higher areal femoral BMD than women before adjusting for
body size,(16) but levels are similar after this adjustment,
with the possible exception of the femoral neck.(25­27) The
current DEXA reports do not adjust BMD for body size, so
gender-specific cutoff values may be necessary to account
for this artifact even though men and women may have
similar true volumetric bone density levels.

LOW FEMORAL BMD IN OLDER U.S. ADULTS 1765
Another unresolved issue in using the WHO criteria is
the appropriate cutoff values for minority men and women.
We applied cutpoints based on young whites to the minority
groups in this study, as well as previously,(10) because the
relationship between femur BMD and hip fracture risk has
been studied exclusively in whites to date.(1,2,3) Prevalences
of osteoporosis for whites and blacks in our study are
similar to estimated lifetime fracture risks for these
groups.(17) We also found a similar ratio of age-adjusted
prevalences in whites versus blacks in our study as the
white­black fracture ratio reported by others.(7,28 ­31) Both
of these findings provide some indirect support for our
approach. The validity of applying white cutoffs to MAs is
more difficult to assess, since very little data are available
on hip fracture rates in U.S. Hispanics. The few studies
done to date suggest that they have lower rates than
whites.(31­33) We found lower prevalences of osteopenia in
MAs than in NHWs, but prevalences of osteoporosis in
women were similar in the two groups (prevalences in men
were too small to compare reliably). However, due to their
higher mean BMD levels,(16) cutoffs based on young MAs
would have resulted in even higher prevalences in this
group compared with NHW, which is less consistent with
fracture patterns. Finally, fracture risk is also influenced by
other, non-BMD factors such as hip axis length, muscle
strength, or falls, which may differ among race or ethnic
groups.(21,34 ­39)
Other issues noted previously in our application of the
guidelines to older women in the U.S., such as accounting
for the individual's age in addition to BMD when consid-
ering risk,(40 ­ 42) still remain to be resolved. In addition, as
noted previously,(10) the young white male and female ref-
erence groups in our study had a lower mean BMD and
higher SD than the male and female references group
provided by the densitometer manufacturer,(43) so that
fewer individuals will be identified with low bone mass than
if the manufacturer's cutoff values are used. Finally, it
should be noted that the absolute BMD values presented in
this paper, including the cutoff values, are densitometer-
specific and cannot be compared directly with BMD results
from other DEXA instruments without a conversion factor
for the femur.
Limitations of this study include potential nonresponse
bias in the sample and the exclusion of institutionalized
people from the NHANES III sample frame. Nonresponse
bias in the sample who came to the mobile exam centers in
NHANES III is reduced to some extent by a nonresponse
adjustment factor included in the calculation of the sample
weights.(11,14) After applying these weighting adjustments,
differences between examinees and nonexaminees were mi-
nor.(14,44,45) However, about 12% of those who came to the
mobile exam centers did not have usable BMD data, and
this nonresponse is not addressed by the sample weight
adjustments. A nonresponse bias study for phase 1 of
NHANES III found differences in weight, self-reported
health status, and vitamin supplement use between those
with bone density data compared with the examined sample
as a whole.(45) We explored nonresponse bias among the
20- to 29-year-old NHW women and in individuals age 50
years to assess the possible impact on means and preva-
lences. Nonrespondents in the young female reference
group weighed more than respondents, but mean total fe-
mur BMD did not differ greatly when imputed data for
nonrespondents (based on their body weight) were added
to the dataset (i.e., 0.941 g/cm2 based on actual and imputed
data vs. 0.937 g/cm2 based on actual data only). Likewise,
differences in weight, self-reported health status, and age
between respondents and nonrespondents age 50 years
did not appear to impact greatly the prevalence estimates
(e.g., 16% of women and 2­4% of men had total femur
osteoporosis whether based on actual and imputed data or
on the actual data alone). Studies to assess the effect of
missing BMD data in phase 2 are continuing as more data
become available from NHANES III. It is also important to
note that the prevalence estimates in this study pertain only
to the noninstitutionalized U.S. population. Institutional-
ized persons may have lower bone mass,(46,47) so the prev-
alence of low bone mass in the total U.S. population is
probably higher than our estimates.
In conclusion, the number of older U.S. adults with low
femur BMD using the WHO criteria is substantial. Most of
these are women, but the number of older U.S. men with
osteopenia or osteoporosis of the femur is not small, re-
gardless of whether these are defined with male or female
cutoffs. Much remains to be learned about BMD and frac-
ture risk in men, but it is likely that men with osteopenia
and osteoporosis would benefit from taking steps to prevent
further bone loss.
