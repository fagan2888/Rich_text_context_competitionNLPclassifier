Abstract: Body height influences human mate preferences and choice. A typical finding in
Western societies is that women prefer men who are taller than themselves and,
equivalently, men prefer women who are shorter than themselves. However, recent reports
in non-Western societies (e.g., the Himba in Namibia) challenge the view on the
universality of such preferences. Here we report on male and female height preferences in
two non-Western populations--the Hadza (Tanzania) and the Tsimane' (Bolivia)--and the
relationships between body height preferences and the height of actual partners. In the
Hadza, most individuals preferred a sexual dimorphism in stature (SDS) with the man
being much taller than the woman. Preferences for SDS and actual partner SDS were
positively and significantly correlated in both men and women, suggesting that people who
preferred larger height differences also had larger height differences with their partners. In
the Tsimane', the majority of men preferred an SDS with the man being taller than the
woman, but women did not show such a preference. Unlike in the Hadza, SDS preference
was not significantly correlated to actual partner SDS. We conclude that patterns of height
preferences and choices in the Hadza and Tsimane' are different than those observed in
Western societies, and discuss possible causes for the observed differences between non-
Western and Western societies.

Introduction
The significance of human body height in mate preferences has been a subject of
many biological and social sciences investigations (e.g., Beigel, 1954; Brewer and Riley,
2009; Buunk, Pollet, Klavina, Figueredo, and Dijkstra, 2009; Cameron, Oskamp, and
Sparks, 1977; Courtiol, Picq, Godelle, Raymond, and Ferdy, 2010; Fink, Neave, Brewer,
and Pawlowski, 2007; Graziano, Brothen, and Berscheid, 1978; Seki, Ihara, and Aoki,
2012; Sorokowski and Butovskaya, 2012; Stulp, Buunk, Kurzban, and Verhulst, 2013;
Stulp, Buunk, Pollet, Nettle, and Verhulst, 2013; Valentova, Stulp, Tebický, and Havlícek,
2014). Body height preferences have been assessed through experimental studies (Graziano
et al., 1978; Shepperd and Strathman, 1989), investigations of lonely-hearts advertisements
(Cameron et al., 1977; Lynn and Shurgot, 1984), and speed-dating settings (Kurzban and
Weeden, 2005; Stulp, Buunk, and Pollet, 2013). The general result of these studies is that
in Western societies men prefer women of average height and women prefer tall men as
possible mating partners (Courtiol, Raymond, Godelle, and Ferdy, 2010; Stulp, Buunk, and
Pollet, 2013a).
Rather than looking at absolute height, other studies have focused on preferences
for height difference between an individual and his/her partner in a romantic relationship
(i.e., sexual dimorphism in stature, SDS = male height/female height). Although a positive
assortative preference has been reported for height preferences in Western societies (i.e.,
taller individuals tend to prefer taller partners; Courtiol, Raymond, et al., 2010; Stulp,
Buunk, Pollet, Nettle, et al., 2013), it has also been shown that both men and women have a
preference for SDS such that a woman is shorter than a man (Fink et al., 2007; Pawlowski,
2003; Shepperd and Strathman, 1989; Stulp, Buunk, Pollet, Nettle, et al., 2013; Stulp,
Buunk, Verhulst, and Pollet, 2013). Both men and women prefer moderate SDS with men
being slightly taller than women, and a maximum acceptable SDS of about a 17%
difference in height (Salska et al., 2008). Moreover, SDS preferences are dependent on
height in that taller men and shorter women prefer larger height difference than do shorter
men and taller women, possibly because this increases the pool of potential partners
(Pawlowski, 2003).
Although these findings have been observed and replicated in a variety of Western
populations (e.g., Courtiol, Raymond, et al., 2010; Stulp, Buunk, Pollet, Nettle, et al.,
2013), giving some validity to the hypothesis that SDS preferences are consistent across
Western societies, it is yet unclear if they can be generalized to non-Western societies.
Recent studies on SDS preferences in non-Western societies argue against the universality
of such an effect. For example, Sorokowski, Sorokowska, Fink, and Mberira (2012) report
that in the Himba of northern Namibia, more than 30% of the individuals preferred an SDS
where partners were of equal height. Moreover, more than 20% of men chose women taller
than themselves. Another study in a non-Western society, the Yali of Papua, concluded that
men and women did not rely on SDS when evaluating an opposite-sex individual as a
potential mate (Sorokowski and Sorokowska, 2012). Finally, in Datoga of Tanzania, both
men and women preferred "extreme" SDS; i.e., men and women preferred partners either
much taller or much shorter than themselves (Sorokowski and Butovskaya, 2012).

Together, these results suggest that SDS preferences in traditional societies are
substantially different from those observed in Western societies (see Table 1). However,
most of these studies have relied on preferred rather than actual SDS between partners, thus
raising the question about the correspondence between these two. In other words, do
people's preferences for body height in opposite-sex mating partners correlate with one
another?
Gillis and Avis (1980) showed that in a Western society, husbands are more likely
to be taller than their wives than would be expected by chance (see also Stulp, Buunk,
Verhulst, et al., 2013), which is at least consistent with earlier mentioned height
preferences. The evidence is, however, much more mixed when examining non-Western
samples. In Gambia and among the Hadza, in approximately 10% of all marriages the wife
was taller than the husband, which was not significantly different from chance, suggesting
that height played less of a role in partner choice in these populations (Sear, 2006; Sear,
Allal, and Mace, 2004; Sear and Marlowe, 2009). Thus, as was the case for the SDS
preferences, patterns of actual SDS in married opposite-sex partners seen in Western
populations are not necessarily observed in non-Western societies and cannot be regarded
as universal (e.g., Sear and Marlowe, 2009).
The observed differences with respect to partner height preferences and mating
patterns between Western and non-Western populations, and the variation between non-
Western populations (e.g., Sorokowski et al., 2012; Sear and Marlowe, 2009), raises the
question as to why these between-population differences exist. Before such a question can
potentially be answered (see discussion for potential reasons), it is necessary to first
document height preferences and mating patterns from many different non-Western
populations. In the present study, we sought to investigate SDS preferences and patterns of
partners' actual SDS in couples in two traditional societies: the Hadza of northern Tanzania
and the Tsimane' of Bolivia. In addition to the investigation of possible differences
between SDS preferences in these two societies compared to those reported in Western
societies, we examined the relationship between SDS preferences and actual SDS between
partners in order to determine how much preferred mate characteristics align with actual
mate characteristics.
Materials and Methods
Participants
The Hadza of Tanzania. The Hadza are a hunter-gatherer society living in Tanzania.
They number approximately 1,000­1,500 individuals and live in mobile camps, each
comprising 30 people on average. This society has been extensively described in the
literature (see Marlowe, 2010; Sear and Marlowe, 2009; Butovskaya, 2013). Women
typically marry between 17 and 18 years of age, and men marry around the age of 20.
Marriages are typically not arranged. Female choice seems to be the main factor leading to
marriage because young single men appear willing to marry a wide range of women.
Because divorce is common, serial monogamy is the best way to characterize the mating
system (Sear and Marlowe, 2009; Butovskaya et al., 2012; Butovskaya, 2013). Although
approximately 4% of men have two wives, polygynous marriages in Hadza are in most
cases a transitory state. In most cases, such polygynous marriages are not stable.

At the time of the study, the participants lived in the Lake Eyasi region. The height of
all participants was measured by one of the authors (MB) using a portable anthropometer. Age
was self-reported, although some participants did not know exactly how old they were.
The Tsimane' from Bolivia. The Tsimane' are a native Amazonian society of farmer-
foragers. Their population of around 8,000 is distributed throughout approximately 100
villages, most of which are in the area of Beni in northern Bolivia. This tribe has been
extensively described in the literature (e.g., Godoy et al., 2005; Huanca, 2008; Ringhofer,
2010).
The participants inhabited the region near the Maniqui River and lived in the villages of
Maracas, Puerto Yucumo, Campo Bello, Catumare, and Anachere. Each participant's height
was measured using a portable anthropometer. All measurements were taken by the principal
investigators (PS, AS). Some of the participants did not take part in all stages of the study (e.g.,
for some individuals we lack information about the height of the partner, because that partner
was not present in the village at the time of the study). Age was self-reported.
The marital customs in the Tsimane' have been described in detail (e.g., Winking,
Gurven, and Kaplan, 2011). Similar to other native Amazonian societies, the Tsimane' still
practice cross-cousin marriage. Traditionally, marriage is arranged by parents. However, in our
sample only 29% of participants declared that their marriage was arranged. Nevertheless, these
measures should be used with some caution as partners did not always agree on this, and
respondents were not always entirely sure, given the long time it took them to answer. Rest
assured, in this population, the parental influence on marriage is strong (Gurven, Winking,
Kaplan, von Rueden, and McAllister, 2009).
Procedure
The data were collected through individual interviews conducted by the authors (MB
among Hadza; AS and PS among Tsimane') with the help of a Tsimane' translator who was
fluent in Spanish and a Hadza translator fluent in English. We used stimuli described in
Sorokowski and Butovskaya (2012), which were slightly modified versions of silhouettes used
by Pawlowski (2003). Although the stimuli are not ideal, they were used in previous studies
both in Western (Fink et al., 2007; Pawlowski, 2003; Valentova et al., 2014) and non-Western
societies (Sorokowski and Butovskaya, 2012; Sorokowski and Sorokowska, 2012; Sorokowski
et al., 2012), and they ensure direct comparability with previous work.
The participants were shown six pairs of silhouettes, each pair with a different SDS (see
Figure 1; participants were shown the version without the letters). For every pair, the size of
the image of the man remained unchanged, but the body of the woman from the original pair
(SDS = 1.09) was shortened or elongated (without manipulating her width) to obtain SDS
ratios ranging from 1.19 (i.e., the man being much taller than the woman) to 0.96 (i.e., the
woman being slightly taller than the man). The ratios decreased in increments of about .05. In
all silhouettes, the size of the head remained unchanged.
Participants were told that each pair represented partners in a romantic relationship and
that the pairs of partners differed in their body heights. They were asked to choose the pair they
would prefer in their own relationship (preferred SDS). Participants were then requested to
provide information on their partner's height (actual SDS). In the Hadza sample, participants
chose the pair from SDS stimuli set which depicted their current relationship; in the Tsimane'
sample, we measured the actual height of the partner. Additionally, to examine the general
validity of the SDS stimuli that we used in both studies, we also collected the data on
SDS choice and preferences in Hadza and Tsimane'

perception of the actual SDS for a subsample of Tsimane' men and women (similarly as
described for the Hadza). We correlated the participants' perception of their actual SDS (six
categories; see Figure 1) with the measured SDS between the partners (raw, uncategorized
data), resulting in a strong and significant correlation, r(105) = .66, p < .0001 (Spearman's rank
correlation was identical). This suggests that judgments of a couple's actual SDS on the basis
of our stimuli were reliable (note that because participants necessarily had to approximate their
SDS given the limited range of categories to choose from, and the categories presented do not
cover all possible SDSs, there is a degree of unavoidable measurement error in these
assessments. This means that we should not expect a perfect correlation between perceived and
actual SDS). In the few polygynous marriages (three men had two wives, who in all cases were
sisters), we collected information about both partners. In general, the Hadza and Tsimane' were
able to comprehend the questions easily.

Analyses
We performed separate analyses for each sex and each population. We did so because:
1) we wished to facilitate comparison with previous studies that followed a similar analysis
strategy; 2) we could not use parametric analysis methods because of the distribution of our
variables; and 3) the methods used differed slightly between our study populations.
Chi-squared tests were used to assess the findings based on the stimuli due to their
categorical nature. Sex differences were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U tests, and Spearman
rank correlations (rs) were used to test for association between two variables.

Results
Hadza preferences for SDS
Our Hadza sample comprised 55 women between 18 and 70 years of age (M = 37.78,
SD = 14.16) and 74 men (for one man, age was missing) between the ages of 17 and 80 (M =
38.89, SD = 16.07). The height of male participants ranged from 142.6 cm to 178.3 cm (M =
161.32; SD = 7.01) and the height of female participants ranged from 138.0 cm to 165.1 cm (M
= 151.44; SD = 5.89). Therefore, similarly to all previously investigated populations, body
height is sexually dimorphic in the Hadza, with men being on average 7% taller than women.
From the 74 male participants, the majority (32%) preferred the highest SDS (1.19),
indicating a preference for relationships in which the man is much taller than the woman. Many
men also preferred to be in a relationship in which the SDS was 1.14 (18%), 1.04 (15%), 1.00
(15%), and 0.96 (15%). An SDS of 1.09 was least preferred (5%) (see Figure 2). Similarly to
the men, the majority of female participants (38%) preferred the highest SDS (1.19). From the
54 women, a considerable number preferred a relationship in which the SDS was 1.14 (11%),
1.04 (9%), 1.00 (18%), and 0.96 (16%). Again similar to men, an SDS of 1.09 was least
preferred (7%) (see Figure 2). In both men and women, the distribution of height preferences
was significantly different from uniform (men: X2[5, n = 74] = 17.14, p <.01; women: X2[5, n =
55] = 21.26, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the sexes did not differ significantly in their median SDS
preference (Mann-Whitney U = 2015, z = -.098, p = .92). In conclusion, both men and women
mostly preferred an SDS such that the man was much taller than the woman.
When examining the correlation between one's own height and preferred SDS, we
found that neither male height (rs[73] =.01, p = .93) nor female height (rs[54] =.11, p = .45)
was related to the preference for SDS in Hadza.

The association between preferences and actual partner height among the Hadza
Next, we investigated the patterns of (perceived) actual SDS among couples (obtained
through the use of the stimuli), examining data from 62 married men and 52 married women.
The majority of male participants (32%) reported to be in marriages with the highest SDS
(1.19). Marriages in which the SDS was reported to be 1.14 (24%), 1.09 (7%), 1.04 (18%),
1.00 (13%), or 0.96 (7%) were all lower in frequency. The patterns as reported by the married
women were very similar to those reported by the married men. The majority of female
participants (33%) reported to be in marriages with the highest SDS (1.19). Fewer women were
in marriages in which the SDS was reported to be 1.14 (17%), 1.09 (6%), 1.04 (17%), 1.00
(15%), or 0.96 (12%). Thus, marriages were reported to most likely occur when the SDS was
very large, which is at odds with the average SDS of 1.07 in this population (see Discussion).
When examining the association between an individual's preferences and actual partner
height, we found a positive correlation in both men (rs[62] = .40, p < .001) and women (rs[52]
= .49, p < .0001). This suggests that in both men and women, those people who preferred large
SDS were also in marriages with large SDS.
Tsimane' preferences for Sexual Dimorphism in Stature
Our sample comprised 70 women between the ages of 17 and 50 (M = 30.49, SD =
10.31) and 68 men between the ages of 18 and 50 (M = 33.97, SD = 11.56). The height of male
participants ranged from 151.3 cm to 180.0 cm (M = 166.50; SD = 5.66); the height of female
participants ranged from 146.0 cm to 165.9 cm (M = 154.92; SD = 4.10). Therefore, body
height is sexually dimorphic in the Tsimane', with men being on average 7% taller than
women.
For 14 women and 9 men we were unable to record their height preferences. From the
59 male participants, the majority (36%) preferred the highest (1.19) or average (1.04) SDS
(27%). A relatively high percentage of participants also preferred an SDS of 1.14 (20%). A
lower percentage of men preferred an SDS of 0.96 (5%), 1.0 (7%), or 1.09 (5%) (see Figure 3).
Thus, Tsimane' men generally preferred to be taller than their wives, with the largest SDS most
preferred. From the 56 women, the highest percentage (23%) preferred an SDS of 1.0,
indicating a preference for relationships in which the man and the woman are of the same
height. Furthermore, a considerable proportion of females preferred romantic relationships in
which the SDS was 0.96 (14%), 1.04 (18%), 1.09 (18%), 1.14 (9%) or 1.19 (18%). In men
(X2[5, n = 59] = 29.98, p < .0001), but not in women (X2[5, n = 56] = 3.79, p = .58) the
distribution of preferences for SDS was significantly different from uniform. Furthermore,
there was a significant difference in median SDS preference between the sexes (Mann-Whitney
U = 1117, z = -3.06, p < .01). Thus, these results suggest that men are more consistent in their
preferences, and that they prefer on average a larger difference in height between themselves
and their partner than women do.
Similar to the Hadza, there was no significant correlation between an individual's
height and his or her preferred SDS (women: rs[56] = - .02, p = .90; men: (rs[59] = -.22, p =
.10).

The association between preferences and actual partner height among the Tsimane'
When examining the heights of married individuals, we found no evidence for
assortative mating for height, as evidenced by the non-significant correlation between partner
heights (rs[76] = .11, p = .35). In total, we observed three couples out of 76 in which the
woman was taller than the man. Based on the SDS of all partnered individuals, we found that
the average SDS was 1.07 (SD = 0.05).
Preferences for SDS did not reflect actual partner height in Tsimane' women (rs[54] = -
.15, p = .28) and men (rs[54] = -.04, p = .77). When examining the subsample of men and
women that also judged their actual SDS using our stimuli, we also found that preferred SDS
did not predict estimated actual SDS (in men: rs[43] = -.06, p = .72; in women: rs[41]=.05, p =
.78). Thus, preferences were not related to partner height.
In contrast to the Hadza, we observed that the estimates of actual SDS assessed via
stimuli were in line with the average measured SDS of 1.07 in this population, and more
generally with the shape of the distribution based on the measured SDSs: 30% of participants'
answered that they were in a marriage in which SDS was perceived to be 1.09. A large number
of participants also suggested their perceived SDS was 1.04 (24.5%) and 1.14 (21%). Much
lower proportions were found for an SDS of 1.19 (10%), 1.00 (9.5%), and 0.96 (5%).
Discussion
In the present study, we sought to investigate SDS (Sexual Dimorphism in Stature)
preferences and patterns of partners' actual SDS in couples in two traditional societies--the
Hadza of northern Tanzania and the Tsimane' of Bolivia. Our findings show that preferred
height differences are different in these populations compared to previous reports on Western
populations (Courtiol, Raymond, et al., 2010; Fink et al., 2007; Pawlowski, 2003; Shepperd
SDS choice and preferences in Hadza and Tsimane'
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(2). 2015. -464-
and Strathman, 1989; Stulp, Buunk, Pollet, Nettle, et al., 2013; Stulp, Buunk, Verhulst, et al.,
2013).
In nomadic foragers from the native Tanzanian Hadza tribe, both men and women most
often preferred the SDS with the man being much taller than the woman in the couple (but see
the limitations), and men and women were similar in their most preferred SDS. Furthermore,
an individual's height did not predict their preferred partner height. We did observe that
preferred height differences were associated with (perceived) actual partner height differences
in both men and women, suggesting that those who preferred a larger SDS also were in a
relationship with a relatively large SDS. Interestingly, in a previous study conducted in the
Hadza, Sear and Marlowe (2009) reported no evidence of a male-taller norm in this tribe, but
they have been collecting their data since 1995, so there might have been some cultural
changes with this regard during the last 20 years.
Preferences for SDS among the Tsimane', foragers and farmers living in the Amazon,
were different to those observed among the Hadza (and again different to those observed in
Western societies). Whereas partner stature did not seem to be important for women's mate
preference (the observed pattern of preferences was not different from random), men did seem
to value height in their partner, with the majority of male participants (36%) preferring the
largest partner height differences. Consequently, men preferred a larger SDS than women. Like
in the Hadza, an individual's height was not associated with preferred SDS. Moreover, and
unlike the case in the Hadza, preferred SDS did not predict spousal SDS.
Although the preferences for very large SDS in Hadza men and women and Tsimane'
men are different to typical patterns observed in Western countries (e.g., Pawlowski, 2003), the
fact that the preferred SDS by men is generally so that the male is taller than the female is at
least consistent. The lack of clear height preferences in Tsimane' women, however, is
interesting and again at odds with those found in Western populations. We speculate that
marriage patterns may account for this result. In the Tsimane', parental influence on children's
marital decisions is stronger in the case of daughters compared to sons (Gurven et al., 2009).
Women may thus appear to be less selective in terms of preferences for partner height because
they have less influence over their choice of marriage partners than in Western populations. In
other words, Tsimane' women's preferences may be masked to a certain degree.
Additionally, an overview of published findings from small-scale societies (including
the data of this present study) shows that partner height preferences in monogamous societies
(e.g., Hadza and Baka) are more similar to those observed in Western societies than in
"extremely" polygynous societies like the Datoga, or Yali (see Table 1). We suggest that in
societies where partners are free to choose their partners, women's height preferences might
tend towards a preference for taller men, whereas this preference might not be observed in
other societies, including polygynous societies with significant wealth stratification or when
spouses are predominantly selected by relatives. We do note, however, that very few studies on
this topic have actually been published (see Table 1), and our conclusions thus should be
treated with a degree of caution.
A similar pattern of results like those observed in Western societies may also be present
in societies where height is related to measures of social status and physical strength, as is the
case for those Western populations (e.g., Judge and Cable, 2004; Sorokowski, 2010; Stulp,
Buunk, Kurzban, et al., 2013), in which taller men are also perceived as being more dominant,
having higher status, being more intelligent, and being healthier (Chu and Geary, 2005;
Jackson and Ervin, 1992; Melamed, 1992). In the Tsimane' adults, there is no association
SDS choice and preferences in Hadza and Tsimane'
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(2). 2015. -465-
between height and perceptions of dominance and intelligence (Undurraga et al., 2012).
According to Godoy et al. (2010), height is furthermore not associated with income or wealth
in this society. Consequently, height may be less important as a trait affecting mate choice in
this population, which could explain why women did not express any clear height preference in
a potential partner. Similar reasoning might also hold for other populations (e.g., Yali) where
no clear SDS preferences were observed (see Table 1).
We also examined the relationship between preferred SDS and actual SDS. In the
Hadza, there was a positive correlation between preferred and actual SDS, suggesting that in
this population mate preferences might influence mate choice. Among Tsimane', however,
preferred SDS did not correlate with actual SDS. Thus, preferred height differences did not
noticeably relate to actual partner height differences. One reason for the existence of this effect
in the Hadza, but its absence in the Tsimane', is that in the latter population marriage partners
are substantially influenced by parents (Gurven et al., 2009). Although there may be conflicts
between parents and offspring about the most appropriate partner (Apostolou, 2008; van den
Berg, Fawcett, Buunk, and Weissing, 2013), it is difficult to predict how "preferences" among
individuals and their parents diverge in this population. Nonetheless, it is certain that because
of the parental influence, the choice of partner is more constrained in the Tsimane' than the
choice of Hadza men and women. Another reason why preferred SDS was not associated with
actual SDS among Tsimane', may be the limited number of mate options (Wolanski and
Siniarska, 1984) in this society. A man mostly chooses a partner from his cousins (Winking et
al., 2011). Finally, characteristics other than height may be much more important when
selecting a mate (Stulp, Buunk, and Pollet, 2013).
Another possible explanation of the between-population differences with respect to
partner height preferences and mating patterns may be the fact that the relationship between
height, health, and survival is dependent on the environment (Godoy et. al., 2010; Sear, 2010;
Stulp and Barrett, in press). For instance, life history theory predicts that in ecologies with high
mortality and scarcity of resources, more energy should be invested in reproduction rather than
growth, and shorter rather than taller individuals may have an advantage in such populations
(Walker et al., 2006). However, comparing the Hadza with the Datoga (see Table 1), two
neighboring populations, we find remarkably different SDS preferences. Given that these tribes
live in very similar ecological conditions but are culturally very distinct--the Datoga are
polygynous pastoralists, and the Hadza are serially monogamous nomadic foragers--these
divergent preferences may be due to differences in cultural practices (e.g., traditions, mating
systems, economy) rather than ecological conditions.
We note some limitations of our study. First, the stimuli used may have resulted in
biased measures of actual SDS between partners in the Hadza. Indeed, both when choosing
their preferred SDS (see Figure 1) and when indicating their actual SDS, most men and women
indicated a rather large difference. For instance, 63% of men and 56% of women indicated that
their actual SDS was between 1.09 and 1.19. Given that the average SDS in this population
equals 1.07, the large proportion of respondents reporting these higher values suggests that
Hadza men and women may have perceived our stimuli or our questions differently to other
populations. Alternatively, our Hadza sample may have been biased towards couples with large
SDS. There are two important things to note here, however: First, although there may have
been biases in perception, these are unlikely to explain the correlation between mate
preferences for SDS and actual SDS in men and women; second, similar limitations were not
observed in the Tsimane'. In the latter sample, the perceived SDS between partners was in line
SDS choice and preferences in Hadza and Tsimane'
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(2). 2015. -466-
with the average SDS and its distribution in that population. Moreover, perceived partner SDS
was strongly associated with measured partner SDS, suggesting that, in the Tsimane' sample,
preferences for SDS are reliable. Another limitation is that, although we interpreted the
association between preferred SDS and actual SDS in the Hadza as a correspondence between
partner preferences and choice, we cannot rule out the possibility that partner characteristics
influence partner preferences (see Courtiol, Picq, et al., 2010 for a discussion).
We suggest that height preferences in (small-scale) societies may best be interpreted as
a compromise between the costs and benefits associated with male and female body height,
relating to reproduction, individual well-being, and survival. Because of different ecological
and social pressures, height preferences may vary among foragers, traditional pastoralists, and
farmers. In some societies, height in men is associated with dominance and status, which may
facilitate male reproductive success and have an impact on female preferences. Power
asymmetries between the genders, in equalities in wealth, pathogen loads, and access to
modern medicine might be additional factors that help explain height preferences.
Documenting further variation in height preferences across distinct populations is required
before any reliable conclusions can be drawn regarding how patterns of height preference co-
vary with ecological and social circumstances.
