Abstract
Background and purpose: Although poor prognosis after intracerebral hemorrhage relates to risk factors and
hematoma characteristics, there is limited evidence for the effect of race­ethnicity.
Methods: Data from 1011 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage enrolled into hyperacute trials and randomized to
control were obtained from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive and Efficacy of Nitric Oxide in Stroke Trial.
Clinical characteristics and functional outcome were compared among three racial groups ­ Asians, Blacks, and
Caucasians.
Results: The majority of patients were Caucasian (78.1%) followed by Asians (14.5%) and Blacks (5.5%). At baseline,
Caucasians were older and had larger hematoma volumes; Blacks had lower Glasgow Coma Scale and higher systolic
blood pressure (all p < 0.05). Although the primary outcome of modified Rankin Scale did not differ at 90 days (p ¼ 0.14),
there were significant differences in mortality (p < 0.0001) and quality of life (EQ-5D p < 0.0001; EQ-VAS p 0.015). In test
of multiple comparisons, Caucasians were more likely to die (p ¼ 0.0003) and had worse quality of life (EQ-5D p ¼ 0.003;
EQ-VAS p < 0.0001) as compared to Asians.
Conclusion: Race­ethnicity appears to explain some of the variation in clinical characteristics and outcomes after acute
intracerebral hemorrhage. Factors that explain this variation need to be identified.

Introduction
Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a
severe cause of stroke associated with significant mor-
bidity and mortality.1 In contrast to ischemic stroke
where incidence has declined in recent decades, the

number of admissions for ICH continues to increase.2,3
Variations in ICH incidence and outcome occur
between different race­ethnicity groups. A higher inci-
dence of ICH is observed among Black and Hispanic
populations when compared with Caucasians.4­6 The
SINO-MONICA-Beijing study reported greater mor-
tality due to ICH in China compared to other coun-
tries.7 Death caused by stroke was reported to be higher
in Asians compared to Caucasian patients in the UK
and Canada.8,9 The causes for these observations are
unclear and might be explained by increased prevalence
of risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension among
Asians.10­13 Additional explanatory factors also appear
to include blood pressure (BP) at presentation.5,14­16
However, studies assessing ICH in different race­
ethnicity groups have mostly involved small centers
with limited numbers of patients and have restricted
comparisons to differences between two racial
populations.5,6,17,18
In this study, we compared baseline clinical charac-
teristics and functional outcome in three racial groups
in patients with ICH. The data came from the Virtual
International Stroke Trials Archive (VISTA) collabor-
ation19 and the Efficacy of Nitric Oxide in Stroke
(ENOS) trial.20
Methods
Data sources
The included patients came from the VISTA-ICH arch-
ive, which includes data from a number of completed
randomized controlled trials (RCTs)19 and the acute
ENOS BP trial.20,21 Patients were those with spontan-
eous ICH, as diagnosed locally using routine neuroima-
ging, and who were treated within 6 h of onset. We
included patients allocated to the control group in
ENOS, as patients assigned to intervention are not
included in VISTA. Patients were excluded if:
age < 18, ICH attributed to trauma, planned surgical
evacuation, previously dependent (modified Rankin
Scale, mRS ! 2), concurrent illness with life expectancy
<6 months, pregnant or breast feeding women, and
those already participating in a study involving another
drug or device.
Baseline data
Data at baseline were obtained for age, sex, time from
ictus to treatment, medical history (previous stroke,
hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus,
hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation, and prior
antithrombotic use), level of consciousness (Glasgow
Coma Scale, GCS), stroke severity (National
Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS), systolic
blood pressure (SBP), and heart rate. Race (and ethni-
city) was defined as Asian (Filipino, Oriental, Asian,
Indian, Palestinian, and Arabic), Black (Black,
African/American, Caribbean), Caucasian (White or
Caucasian), and Others (American Indian, mixed-
colored, mixed, Hispanic, colored, Hawaiian and
Pacific Islanders).
Outcome data
Outcome at day 90 was assessed using the mRS and all-
cause mortality; where available, data on disability
(Barthel Index, BI) and quality of life (European qual-
ity of Life-5 dimensions, EQ-5D) were also assessed.
Neuroimaging
Depending on trial protocol, CT scans were performed
following treatment and then again at 72 h.
Information from CT scans was collected for hemor-
rhage location, lesion volume, edema volume, presence
of mass effect, subarachnoid bleeding, intraventricular
hemorrhage, brain atrophy, and leukoaraiosis.
Statistical analysis
The primary outcome was the mRS at day 90. Baseline
characteristics and outcomes were compared by
Pearson 2 test for categorical variables and analysis
of variance for continuous variables. The relationship
between baseline hematoma volume and mRS between
ethnic groups was analyzed using multiple regression.
Individual comparisons between ethnic groups were
made using Bonferroni correction. Mortality was
assessed using Kaplan­Meier curves and Cox
Regression. Analyses were adjusted for age, NIHSS,
ICH volume, and time to treatment. Confidentiality
agreements precluded identification of the individual
trials in VISTA-ICH and so analyses were not adjusted
for trial. Since death is present in outcome scores such
as mRS (6), HUS (0), and BI (À5), death was scored for
European quality of life-visual analogue scale
(EQ-VAS) as À1. Statistical significance was set at
p 0.05. All analyses were performed using SPSS (ver-
sion 21) running on an Apple Mac computer.
Results
Baseline clinical and neuroimaging characteristics
A total of 1011 patients were identified: 979 recruited
from VISTA-ICH19 and 32 from ENOS.20 The mean
age was 66.2 years, 63.2% were male, the average time
to treatment was 3.7 h and the mean GCS was 13.8
(Table 1). The majority of patients were Caucasian

(78.1%), followed by Asians (14.5%) and Blacks
(5.5%). Less than 2% were in the `other group' and
these were removed from further analyses. When ana-
lyzed by baseline characteristics, Black patients were
younger and more likely to have a previous history of
hypertension and higher SBP at baseline. Caucasian
patients trended to have more atrial fibrillation, and
Asian patients were less likely to have a prior history
of antithrombotic use. The mean ICH volume was
22.7 cm3 and most hematomas were located in the
deep subcortical white matter of the brain (Table 1).
Clinical outcomes
Table 2 shows clinical and radiological outcome meas-
ures by ethnicity. The primary outcome, mRS, did
not differ between race groups at either day 7 or 90
(Figure 1). Similarly, there was no difference in
NIHSS during the first seven days. Whilst the BI dif-
fered at day 7, it was not significant at day 90 using a
test of multiple comparisons. Quality of life, assessed
using two measures (health utility status derived from
EQ-5D and EQ-VAS), differed between the three
groups (Table 2, Figure 2); following adjustment for
multiple comparisons, Caucasians had a worse quality
of life scores for both EQ-5D and EQ-VAS as com-
pared to Asians (Table 2). Adjusted survival rates dif-
fered between race­ethnicity groups (Table 2, Figure 3),
explained by a significant difference between Asians
and Caucasians (p ¼ 0.005). There were no other signifi-
cant differences for other outcomes.
Neuroimaging outcomes
ICH volume differed across the race groups on both the
first follow-up scan (Table 2, Figure 4) and at 72 h.
(Table 2); in both cases, Caucasians tended to having
large hematoma (Table 2). Similarly, edema volumes
differed across the race groups on both the first
follow-up scan and at day 7 with Caucasian patients
have large edema volumes than Black patients. The
presence of hydrocephalus also differed and was highest
in Caucasians. The presence of intraventricular hemor-
rhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage and midline shift did
not differ between the race groups (Table 2).
When assessing the relationship between baseline
hematoma volume and mRS, there was a significant
difference in the slope of the regression lines between
the race­ethnicity groups; Blacks and Asians appeared
to have a worse mRS for a given hematoma volume
(p ¼ 0.047; online Supplementary Figure 1). There
were no other significant differences between any of
the other comparison groups.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine
clinical and neuroimaging features and outcomes in
Figure 1. Distribution of modified Rankin scores between the three race groups at day 90.

ICH patients across three race groups. Significant dif-
ferences in age, the frequency or previous stroke and
hypertension, GCS, BP, and ICH volume were present
between Caucasian, Asian, and Black patients.
Similarly, differences in neuroimaging features were
present for hematoma location and volume, edema
volume, and the presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage,
hydrocephalus, leukoaraiosis, and cerebral atrophy.
Although there was no difference in the primary out-
come of mRS at day 90, significant differences in case
fatality and quality of life were present. Similarly, dif-
ferences in ICH and edema volume, and the presence of
hydrocephalus, were present between the race groups.
Black patients were younger and a larger proportion
had a history of hypertension which could be associated
with increased smoking, alcohol, and drug abuse.17,18 It
is noteworthy that BP in Blacks was higher on admis-
sion and probably reflects inadequate control, poor
compliance with treatment or treatment resistance.17,23
Higher BP in the acute phase of ICH is common24 and
associated with neurological deterioration through
hematoma expansion and re-bleeding.24­26 The treat-
ment implications of racial difference in BP lowering
need investigation as evidence suggests that early treat-
ment is both safe and feasible20,27 and is now recom-
mended in guidelines.28,29 In contrast to a previous
report of greater mortality in Blacks for every stroke
subtype,30 VISTA­ENOS found reduced survival in
Caucasians with ICH. This finding is difficult to explain
and may relate to hemorrhage location, inherent sus-
ceptibility to ICH or quality of care or simply that
race­ethnic differences persist even after controlling
for such characteristics.
As would be expected, ICH survivors had a quality
of life worse than that reported in the general popula-
tion.31,32 The difference between Caucasians and Asians
has been reported previously14,33 and may relate to
family values, cultural attitudes, and care prefer-
ences.33,34 In one study, Asians were more likely to be
living at home, whilst Caucasians were less likely to be
discharged home despite better functional improve-
ment.35 Apart from cultural and family factors, age,
female sex, stroke severity, persistent neglect, and
socioeconomic status have also been shown to affect
quality of life after stroke.36,37
The strengths of the study include a relatively large
sample size for a study population with detailed clin-
ical, radiological information, and multiple functional
endpoints. The included patients were from neutral
RCTs or control group and therefore assessment of
the race­ethnic differences avoided the confounding
effects of active treatment. However, there are some
limitations. First, the analysis on observational data

included on the basis of pre-specified selection
criteria. It is possible that those with more severe
stroke with reduced level of consciousness, older
patients with multiple comorbidities and pre-existing
do not resuscitate orders, may have been excluded.
Therefore, the results may not be applicable to a popu-
lation of unselected ICH patients. Second, the VISTA
collaboration does not reveal the identities of the indi-
vidual trials and so it is uncertain as to what inclusion
criteria were used to select patients. Additionally, ana-
lyses could not be adjusted for the source trials, which
is important since trials themselves are a determinant of
outcome. Nevertheless, the data were subject to strict
verification and so the results are externally valid.
Third, ethnicity relates to culture, geography, language
and it is not clear from the data if this was self-reported
or defined by the investigator. Fourth, to compensate
for limited numbers, distinct subpopulations were
grouped into one ethnic group (for example Asians
included people from China, Philippines, the Indian
subcontinent, and Arabian peninsula), whilst small
groups present in the `others' category were excluded.
This may have not been appropriate as stroke risk and
functional outcome vary within subpopulations living
in the same country and between countries.38,39 Last,
the analysis is limited to trials sharing information
within the collaboration and therefore those studies
that are not represented in VISTA would not have
been included.
In conclusion, this analysis from hyperacute trials in
hemorrhagic stroke found significant race differences in
baseline clinical characteristics and hematoma meas-
ures. There were no difference in the primary outcome
of death or dependency but differences in death rates
and quality of life were apparent. Further studies are
needed to which factors explain race­ethnic differences
and whether these differences become larger over time.
Our results suggest that future trials should undertake
measures to ensure adequate representation of all major
race­ethnic groups. This might include standard defin-
itions for race­ethnicity that reflect common features
but not limited to biological, cultural, and social differ-
ences. Further research is also needed to understand
where inadequacies in health care systems exist and
what interventions can be made to reduce such dispa-
rities. This could include allowing more resources to
