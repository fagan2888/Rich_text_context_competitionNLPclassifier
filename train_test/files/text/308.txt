Social Mobility from a Kinship Perspective: Rural
Liaoning, 1789­1909Ã
C a m e r on Ca m pbell a n d J ame s L e e
Summary: This paper examines the role of kin networks in intergenerational
mobility in rural Liaoning, China, 1789­1909. Classic studies of social mobility in
historical China based on the records of imperial examination candidates suggest
that society was relatively fluid. It has been claimed, however, that associations
between fathers'and sons' outcomes overestimate the fluidity of historical Chinese
society because many men who achieved prominence had been helped by senior kin
other than their fathers. We test these claims by applying event-history techniques
to longitudinal, nominative household register data, measuring the effects of
characteristics of kin on the chances of obtaining an official title. Even though
distant kin influenced the chances of obtaining a title, kin networks did not
monopolize opportunities. There was substantial downward mobility among the
sons of prominent families, and high proportions of titleholders were new, in the
sense of not having any senior kin who held titles.

A central question in the study of Chinese society before the twentieth
century has been whether it was open or closed, that is, how much social
mobility there was between one generation and the next. Most of the
debate and associated empirical work have focused on elites. On the one
hand, it has been argued that the merit-based imperial examination system
offered opportunities for advancement to those who were not the sons or
grandsons of officials. Society, as a result, was relatively ``open''.1 On the
other hand, it has been claimed that examination candidates whose fathers
and grandfathers were undistinguished often had more distant kin who

played a role in their success.2 Even if positions were not transmitted
directly from father to son, members of certain kinship networks had a
powerful advantage when it came to launching their sons into official
careers. Those who were not members of such networks were shut out.
Society, as a result, was more ``closed'' than would be apparent from an
analysis of the association between fathers' and sons' outcomes.
The extent of social mobility in rural China before the twentieth century
is even less clear. It used to be assumed that local society was more static
than elite society. Climbing the lowest rungs of the ladder of success was
difficult because families needed to accumulate substantial resources
before they could even consider such mobility strategies as the education
of their sons. Locally prominent families, meanwhile, could make use of
their economic, political, and social resources to maintain their position
from one generation to the next. Recent evidence, however, suggests that
the picture may have been more complex. Preliminary analysis of data on
the residents of Daoyi, a state-farm system located in what is now

Liaoning province, suggests that, during the nineteenth century, most of
the men who held official titles were from undistinguished backgrounds in
that neither their fathers nor their grandfathers had ever held titles.3 An
extension of this work that considered roles for other co-resident male kin
confirmed the conclusion that large proportions of the men who acquired
titles were from households where no-one had ever held one.4
The data and methods normally used to study intergenerational social
mobility are not likely to resolve the issue to everyone's satisfaction. One
of the most frequently noted features of Chinese society was the
importance of the extended family, including distant kin. As Hymes
argued, even if the sons of successful imperial examination candidates had
only a slight advantage when it came to succeeding in the examinations
themselves, there may have been networks of kin that were disproportion-
ately successful at securing opportunities for their members. Similarly, in
rural Liaoning, even if the possession of an official title by father or other
co-resident kin had only a mild effect on the chances that a male would
attain a title, the results in Lee and Campbell5 cannot rule out the
possibility that members of particular lineages nevertheless accounted for
most of the men with official titles. Similarly, the results in Lee and
Campbell6 cannot rule out a role for transmission between related males
living in separate households. In situations where the transmission of
status from one generation to the next was highly diffuse, only a weak
association between the outcomes of father and son would be apparent,
even if most or all of the men who succeeded on the examinations or
attained titles were from a relatively small number of families.
To account for the potential role of kin networks in determining
mobility outcomes in late imperial China, we apply quantitative methods
to nominative, longitudinal population-register data. The population-
register data cover a population of largely rural residents of Liaoning
province in northeast China from 1749 to 1909. They allow for
identification of the paternal kin of an individual even if they are distantly
related. Measurement of the characteristics of kin is thus straightforward.
We apply discrete time-event history techniques to examine how the
possession of titles by various kin affected the chances that a male would
attain an official title. We focus on the effects of possession of title by
fathers, uncles, fathers' first cousins, and fathers' second cousins. We test
directly the hypothesis that society was more closed than it appears from

the association between fathers' and sons' outcomes, because men could
also ``inherit'' high status from senior kin other than their fathers. We also
examine whether or not there was clustering among related men of the
same generation, holding the characteristics of the senior generation
constant. From these results, we can whether opportunities were available
to all men or monopolized by particular kin networks.
These results will further illuminate interactions between kin living in
separate households in historical China. A distinguishing feature of the
longitudinal population registers is that by chaining together the links
between parents and children, we generate genealogies for individuals and
identify their distant kin. In contrast with Campbell and Lee,7 which only
considered co-resident kin, here we identify kin who lived in separate
households and examine how their characteristics affected the chances that
a male would attain a title. Extending on a line of inquiry initiated in
Campbell and Lee,8 for these distant kin we examine whether or not co-
residence conditioned the effects of attaining a title.
These results will showcase the potential of longitudinal population
register data to open up a new avenue for inquiry in the analysis of social
mobility. Until now, almost all studies of intergenerational social mobility,
whether historical or contemporary, have focused on the influence of
parents' characteristics on children's outcomes, and to some extent the
associations between siblings' outcomes. This partly reflects the limit-
ations of the available data. The surveys that are the basis for most analyses
of contemporary social mobility rarely provide detail on kin of the
respondent other than their siblings and parents. Similarly, historical
studies of social mobility have focused almost exclusively on associations
between the outcomes of fathers and sons, and failed to address the
possibility that kin other than the father affected the attainment of status.9
The remainder of the paper is divided into four sections. The first
section reviews in more detail debates and findings on social mobility in
China. Because the sociological literature on mobility in China is sparse,
we will consider both contemporary and historical evidence. The second
and third sections introduce the data and methods, respectively. The
fourth section presents and discusses results. To facilitate interpretation,
we present simulation results along with the coefficients estimated in the

different backgrounds expected to ever attain a title in the course of their
lifetime. They are also used to work out the distribution of backgrounds
for the men who do attain titles. The paper concludes with a discussion of
the implications of the findings for our understanding of kinship and social
mobility in historical Chinese society.
B A C K G R O U N D
Late imperial Chinese society is widely noted for the emphasis by the state
on achieved, not ascribed, characteristics in the recruitment and promotion
of high-level officials. The Tang dynasty (670­906 AD) saw the
elimination of the hereditary aristocracy. From the Song dynasty (960­
1127 AD) onward, officials were chosen through examinations open to
almost all educated men. By the middle of the Qing (1644­1911 AD),
there were no more officially recognized hereditary status distinctions,
except for special situations such as membership in the imperial lineage,
the Eight-Banner system, and ethnicity. When it came to attaining an elite
official title, ancestry should in theory only have mattered indirectly, in
that those from a privileged background were more likely to be educated
and therefore successful on imperial examinations.
The relatively few empirical studies of social mobility in historical
China confirm that men of undistinguished parentage did indeed have a
chance to attain official titles. According to one classic analysis of the
family backgrounds of successful candidates on the two highest level
imperial examinations during the Ming (1368­1644 AD) and Qing, in the
period of peak mobility in the sixteenth century as many as one-half of
successful candidates were ``new men'', in the sense that neither their
fathers nor their grandfathers had held a degree of any sort.10 While certain
families were consistently successful at launching their sons into official
careers, there appears to have been room at the top for men from less
distinguished families, and accordingly a steady infusion of new blood.
The few available quantitative studies for rural Chinese populations
before the twentieth century also suggest that society was open. For that
community, analysis of household registers showed that over one-half of
the men who attained a state occupation were the sons of men who had
never held one.11 One-third of men who attained a state occupation not
only had a father who had never held an occupation, but had never lived
with anyone who had ever held one. This preliminary study, based as it
was on simple bivariate tabulations, did not measure the influence of the

experiences of fathers and other kin, nor did it attempt to measure how
successful men with status were at transmitting their status to their sons. A
more refined analysis of an expanded dataset that applied multivariate
event-history techniques to distinguish between the effects of different co-
resident kin reached a similar conclusion.12 While the possession of a title
by senior male kin other than the father increased the chances that a male
would acquire one himself, there was little evidence that particular
households monopolized titles. Depending on the type of title considered,
between one-half and two-thirds of men who acquired titles appear to
have been ``new'' in the sense that no one present in the household had ever
held one.
What little evidence exists for China during the middle of the twentieth
century hints that it may have been relatively ``open'' by the standards of
other societies. While results likely reflect the strong emphasis by the post-
1949 state on egalitarianism in the allocation of educational and
occupational opportunities, we note them here to provide some back-
ground. The clearest evidence is from analysis of educational attainment.
In an analysis of 1982 Chinese census data on men in multigenerational
households, Deng and Treiman13 found that the influence of the father's
educational attainment on their own educational attainment for men born
in the 1940s was half as strong as in other countries. As for occupational
mobility, one study revealed that even though the high proportion of
farmers in the population led to a low rate of total mobility, the vast
majority of holders of high-status occupations were the children of parents
in low-status occupations. Less than 20 per cent of professionals, for
example, were the children of professionals. Roughly half were the
children of farmers.14
Agreement about the openness of historical Chinese society is by no
means universal. One detailed study of elites in a southern Chinese
community during the Song dynasty claimed that many of the men who
succeeded in the imperial examinations, even though their fathers or
grandfathers were undistinguished, had been assisted by distant kin who
had been successful.15 Members of certain kin networks, in other words,
had a substantial advantage when it came to taking the examinations and
starting on official careers. Those who were not fortunate enough to be

born into such networks had limited opportunities for advancement, and
in this sense society was ``closed''.16
The large literature on kinship in Chinese society tends to confirm that
networks based on family relationship had the potential to affect mobility
outcomes. In the early part of the twentieth century, Lang17 and others
identified the importance of kin networks as an obstacle to economic
development in China because the intense pressure on individuals with
influence over hiring decisions to take care of their relatives spawned
nepotism and particularism. More recently, Greenhalgh,18 Whyte,19
Wong,20 and others have suggested that strong ties between kin, co-
resident and non-co-resident, contributed to rapid economic growth in
Greater China from the 1970s onwards. Kin are claimed to be sources of
reliable employees, capital, contacts, and information. Anthropologists, of
course, have written extensively on the role of lineages, especially in south
China.21 In the past, well-organized lineages provided educational and
other opportunities to their members. More recently, Bian22 showed that
in urban China in the 1980s, individuals relied heavily on their social
networks, including their kin, to secure economic opportunities in an
environment where jobs were almost all assigned by the state.
In our analysis, accordingly, we will distinguish between two opposing
hypotheses about the extent of intergenerational social mobility in rural
Liaoning. On the one hand, if official titles in this rural population were
allocated according to the same merit-oriented principles as official titles
among the national elites, inheritance should have been relatively weak.
Simulation results should reveal low probabilities that the sons of men
with titles would acquire titles themselves, and high probabilities that the
men who did acquire an official title had no kin, co-residing or not, who
held an official titles. On the one hand, if particular networks of kin were

net when identifying distant kin who may have helped men at their examinations. It is entirely
possible that any random sample of men from elite families would exhibit the same proportions
with successful distant kin as his sample of successful examination candidates.

especially successful at securing titles for their members, then even if
father­son inheritance was weak, most of the men who acquired titles
should at least have had distant kin who held titles, perhaps living in other
households.
We will assess fluidity by comparing rates of downward mobility among
the sons of elites and the proportions of elites who are ``new blood'' to
published results on other historical populations, mainly in North
America and Europe. Over the past few decades, a number of studies of
intergenerational mobility in the past have appeared.23 These studies, like
this one, mostly focused on specific populations that are not nationally
representative. Many of these populations are not ideal for comparison
because they were urban. In some cases, they were subsets of an urban
population. The population analysed here, of course, is rural.
The goal in carrying out such a comparison is not to make a definitive
statement about whether China, or rural Liaoning, was more or less fluid
than the West, but rather to help assess claims by Hymes24 and others
about the rigidity associated with the importance of kinship networks in
attaining elite positions. If Hymes25 is correct, we should find that
downward mobility among men whose fathers or other senior kin held
title was much less than in other historical populations. More importantly,
the proportion of titleholders in each generation who are ``new'', in the
sense of not having any senior relatives who also hold titles, should be
much lower than the proportion of elites in other populations who are
``new'' in the sense of having undistinguished fathers.
We also seek to distinguish between two hypotheses about the nature of
relationships between kin living in separate households. On the one hand,
the common understanding that the descent group or lineage played an
important role in structuring individual outcomes in historical China leads
to an expectation that the influence of the characteristics of kin should
have been independent of whether or not they actually resided in the same
household. On the other hand, empirical results on the influence of

characteristics of kin on male marriage chances in Campbell and Lee26
suggest that, at least in Liaoning, the residential household may have been
more important than the lineage as a unit of social and economic
organization. In that analysis, the characteristics of kin affected the
marriage chances of a male only if the kin resided in the same household.
The characteristics of kin living outside the household had no influence on
marriage chances.
DAT A
Our study focuses on a population of hereditary tenants who lived on state
farms in Liaoning province in northeast China during the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries. These hereditary tenants were the descendants of
Han Chinese settlers recruited by the state to move from Shandong
Province in the late seventeenth century and repopulate the Chinese
northeast, which had been emptied in the course of the Ming­Qing
transition in the first half of the seventeenth century. The settlers were
given the right to farm land controlled by the Eight Banners, a civil and
military administration that was a key part of the Qing state. Each was
associated with one of several dozen separately registered state farm
populations. In terms of their institutional context, these tenants are
perhaps most comparable to tenants on crown lands in historical Europe.
They did have some distinguishing features. In particular, though they
could not move from the state lands, they could move within them.
For the purposes of this analysis the most important feature of these
state-farm tenants is that their association with the Eight-Banner system
made them eligible for official titles. There were altogether five categories
of official title: banner, civil service, examination, honorary, and household
group leader. The first three categories were formal governmental offices
and often included a generous salary and other perquisites. Banner titles
were associated with position in the Eight-Banner system, while civil
service titles were associated with positions elsewhere in the bureaucracy.
Examination titles came with success in the official examinations. The
fourth category, honorary titles, were typically purchased. They are
indicative of individual or family wealth. The fifth category, household
group leader, or zuzhang, is by far the most common and refers to an
unsalaried position at the lowest level of local banner administration. We
do not consider it in our analysis.
Possession of an official title was the most important source of privilege
in this society, so that titleholders constituted an elite.27 They accounted
for roughly 5 per cent of adult males in the populations studied here at any

perquisites associated with each title, we know that they were often
sufficient to support several families, and came both in cash and in kind.
The privilege associated with holding a title is reflected in the data in
important demographic outcomes.28 Titleholders and their sons married
earlier and in higher proportions, and once married, had more children.
While in implications of holding a title for men and their immediate kin are
clear, our analysis of the implications for more distant relatives is ongoing.
The state-farm tenants lived in approximately 400 distinct communities
scattered across a swath of land in Liaoning equivalent in size to the
Netherlands. Figure 2 summarizes the geographic distribution of observa-
tions, with each circle corresponding to a community and its size
corresponding to the number of observations it contributed. The swath
ran from the coast of the Bohai Gulf on the Liaodong Peninsula in
southwest Liaoning all the way to a hilly and remote region in the
northwest of the province. The southern state-farm systems were all
located in or near what is now Gaiping county on the Liaodong Peninsula.
They were either on or close to the coast of the Bohai Gulf. They were
close to Yingkou, which became a treaty port open to international trade in
1858. The northern state farms lay were scattered in a belt that ran from
what is now the provincial capital, Shenyang, to a hilly and remote region
in the northeast of the province.
The data on the tenants is derived from ``Household and Population
Registers of the Eight-Banner Han Army'' (Hanjun baqi rending hukou ce).
This source is described in detail in Lee and Campbell,29 which also
provides additional background on the population. The household
registers were compiled on a triennial basis for a number of Han banner
populations living on state farms in the northeast and certain other
locations from the early eighteenth century until 1909. The Qing relied
heavily on these registers for civilian and military administration of these
populations. They accordingly devised a system of internal crosschecks to
ensure consistency and accuracy. First, they assigned every person in the
banner population to a residential household (linghu) and registered them
on a household certificate (menpai). Then they organized households into
clans (zu), and compiled annually updated clan genealogies (zupu). Finally,
every three years they compared these genealogies and household
certificates with the previous household register to compile a new register.
They deleted and added people who had exited or entered in the last three
years and updated the ages, relationships, and official titles of those people
who remained. Each register, in other words, completely superseded its
predecessor.

The banner registers provide far more comprehensive and accurate
demographic and sociological data than the household registers and
lineage genealogies common elsewhere in China.30 This is because the
northeast, which was the Qing homeland, was under special state
jurisdiction, distinct from the provincial administration elsewhere.
Regimentation of the population actually began as early as 1625, when
the Manchus made Shenyang their capital and incorporated the surround-
ing communities into the banner system.31 By the late eighteenth century,
not only was the population registered in remarkable precision and detail,
migration was strictly controlled, not just between northeast China and
China proper, but between communities within northeast China as well.

Government control over the population was tighter than in almost any
other part of China. Indeed, individuals who departed from the area
without permission were actually identified in the registers as ``escapees''
(taoding). As a result, the Eight-Banner household registers are the most
extensive and detailed records of a any rural Chinese population in the late
imperial period.32
The registers record at three-year intervals for each person in the target
population the following information in order of appearance: official title
(if any); relationship to the household head; name(s); adult banner status;
age in sui; animal birth year; lunar birth month, birthday, and birth hour;
marriage, death, or emigration, if any, during the intercensal period;
physical disabilities, if any, and if the person is an adult male; name of their
kin-group head; banner affiliation; and village of residence. Individuals are
listed one to a column in order of their relationship to the head, with his
children and grandchildren listed first, his co-resident siblings and their
descendants listed next, and then uncles, aunts, and cousins. Wives are
always listed immediately after their husbands, unless they are superceded
by a co-resident widowed mother-in-law.
The registers are distinguished by the possibilities for record linkage
across time and between kin. Individuals can be followed very easily from
one register to the next because they appear in almost the same order in
successive registers. Accordingly, it is relatively straightforward to
reconstruct life histories and generate variables describing such past
characteristics as whether or not a male had previously held a title. Perhaps
more importantly, by comparison of observations for the same individual
in successive registers, we can construct outcome measures indicating
whether or not particular events took place in a particular time interval.
For this analysis, as described later, we construct indicators of whether or
not males acquire official titles between one register and the next.
The extensive detail on household relationship, meanwhile, allows for
reconstruction of genealogies and identification of kin living in the same or
different households. Our basic procedure is to chain together the links
between fathers and sons to identify grandfathers, great-grandfathers, and
more distant male ancestors. Table 1 summarizes the numbers of
generations back for which it is possible to trace the men recorded in
the observations. Males whose grandfathers can be identified accounted
for slightly more than two-thirds of the observations. Males whose great-
grandfathers can be identified accounted for nearly one-half of the
observations. How far back an individual's ancestry may be traced
depends largely on when they lived. Many of the men who were born in
the last decades of the nineteenth century or the first decade of the
twentieth can have their ancestry traced back six or seven generations.

Since most of the men who were already adults in the earliest registers had
already lost their fathers and grandfathers, they accounted for most of the
men whose ancestry could not be traced.
Once we constructed genealogies, it was a straightforward matter of
data processing to link men to their brothers, cousins, first cousins, second
cousins, and even more distant kin and measure their characteristics.
Because the registers identify who lives with whom, we can further
distinguish between co-resident and non-co-resident. For men whose
grandfathers can be identified, we can locate uncles and cousins. For men
whose great-grandfathers can be identified, we can locate second cousins
and fathers' cousins. In all cases, we are restricted to paternal kin. While
the registers record men's wives, they do not allow them to be traced back
to their natal families.
The data we analyze are a subset from a sample of registers we have
compiled that consist of 705,355 observations of 129,180 individuals who
lived in 14 separately registered state farm populations in Liaoning
province. Restrictions dictated by the methods described in the next
section permit analysis of only 78,106 of the 607,163 observations from 11
state-farm populations.33 First, we only include observations of males aged
11 to 50 sui, that is, roughly 10 to 49 Western years of age.34 Males outside
this age range almost never acquired official titles. Females, meanwhile,
were not eligible for titles. Second, we can only include observations from
after 1789 because the registers from before that year do not distinguish
33. In this particular analysis, we restrict our analysis to eleven populations of regular
bannermen (zhengshen qiren) under what were called the three banner commanders (san zuoling
xia). We exclude three departmental privy purse, or guangchusi, populations who were
responsible for such specialized production as honey, cotton, and fish. They were administered
separately and accordingly behaved differently (Yizhuang Ding, Guo Songyi, James Lee, and
Cameron Campbell, Liaodong yimin de qiren shehui [Banner Society and the Settlement of
Eastern Liaodong], book manuscript, 2001). Most importantly for the purposes of this analysis,
most of the men in these populations appear not to have been eligible for official titles.
34. In the Chinese system of age reckoning, individuals were 1 sui at birth, and their age was
incremented every lunar new year. Ages reckoned in sui are on average 1.5 higher than ages
reckoned according to the Western standard.

individuals by their residential household. Thus we cannot distinguish co-
resident from non-co-resident kin in the registers before 1789. Third, the
need to identify the time periods in which titles were acquired requires that
we restrict to observations of males for which observations are also
available three or six years hence. Fourth, since we are interested in how
the characteristics of second cousins and fathers' cousins affect the chances
of attaining a title, we only consider observations of males whose fathers,
grandfathers, and great-grandfathers could all be identified. Finally, since
we are interested in the factors that influence the chances of acquiring a
title between the current and next register, we exclude observations of
males who currently hold titles.
M E T H O DS A ND M E A S U R E S
To measure the influence of own and family characteristics on the chances
of acquiring an official title, we use a discrete time-event-history approach.
An event-history approach has several advantages for the study of
mobility, most notably the ability to account for the effects of changes
over time in individual characteristics and the macrosocial context.35 In
particular, we use complementary log­log regression, the discrete-time
approach that yields results most comparable to those from continuous-
time approaches.36 The following equation summarizes the basic model:
f( p) ¼ â0 þ bX
The transformed probability p of an outcome of interest is expressed as a
linear function of a set of right-hand side variables X that measure
individual and family characteristics. Estimated coefficients b measure the
strength of the association between these variables and the complementary
log­log of the outcome of interest. A positive coefficient indicates that
higher values of the associated right-hand variable of interest are associated
with increased chances of the outcome. A negative coefficient indicates an
inverse association. A coefficient close to zero suggests a lack of asso-
ciation. Tests of statistical significance help indicate whether differences
between estimated coefficients and zero are large enough to reject the null
hypothesis that there is no relationship and that the observed coefficient
might be the result of random variation in the data.

For our outcome variable, we use an indicator of whether or not a male
currently without an official title acquires one by the time they are next
observed.37 Table 2 reveals that too. We only consider acquisition of titles

37. In previous analyses we have distinguished among the different types of official title (Lee and
Campbell, Fate and Fortune, p. 169; Campbell and Lee, ``Family Background''). We avoid doing
so here to keep the results on the role of different kin easy to interpret.

associated with privilege: banner, civil service, examination, and honorary.
Since we restrict to observations where either the immediately following
register or the one after that is available, this amounts to an indicator of
whether or not a male acquires a title in the next three or six years. Because
the length of time until the next available observation will be positively
associated with the chances of acquiring an official title, we include as an
explanatory variable a dichotomous indicator of whether or not the next
observation is six years away instead of three. To measure the role of
family background in determining mobility outcomes, we include as
explanatory variables counts of the numbers of senior kin who hold official
titles. Table 2 summarizes them. To measure ``classic'' father­son
inheritance, we include an indicator of whether or not the father has a
title. To account for the possibility that men could be advantaged by the
presence of other kin with titles, we include similar variables for other male
kin. For uncles, we count the number who co-resided who held official
titles. We have no variable for non-co-resident uncles because there were
too few of them. Even elderly men almost always lived with any surviving
brothers they had. For fathers' cousins with titles, we include separate
counts according to whether or not they co-reside.
To assess openness, we examine outflows and inflows calculated from
simulations that use the estimated coefficients as inputs. For outflows, we
construct a life table from the predicted probabilities of attaining a title at
each age, and work out the chances that a man would obtain a title if he
survived to age fifty sui. If this simulation indicated that most men whose
fathers or other senior kin held official titles acquired a title themselves, the
interpretation would be that certain kin networks were very successful at
securing opportunities for their junior members. From this perspective,
society would appear ``closed''. On the other hand, if most of the men
whose fathers or other senior kin held official titles failed to acquire titles
of their own, that would indicate the presence of substantial downward
mobility, and suggest that society was ``open''. For inflows, we calculate
predicted probabilities of attaining a title for each of the men in the
population, and from these work out the distribution of family back-
grounds for the sub-population of men who have a title. If most of the men
who acquired official titles appeared to have senior kin who already held a
title, the indication would be that society was closed. If most of the men
who acquired titles had no senior kin who already held titles, the
indication would be that society was open.
To examine whether or not there was clustering among related males of
the same generation in the acquisition of titles, we include counts of the
numbers of kin of the same generation with official titles. The goal is to
assess whether or not some kin networks were better than others at
securing titles for their members, even when the characteristics of the
senior generation are held equal. We include variables for the numbers of

co-resident brothers and cousins with titles. There were almost no non-co-
resident brothers and too few non-co-resident cousins to warrant
including variables for them. We also include separate counts of co-
resident and non-co-resident second cousins with titles. Positive coeffi-
cients on these variables would indicate the presence of clustering. While
clustering would not indicate that society was ``closed'' in the classic sense,
it would indicate that kin networks were important.
We also examine whether or not other characteristics of the family
played a role. To test whether or not families positioning male members
for the acquisition of a title favored eldest sons, we include an indicator of
whether or not the man was the eldest surviving brother in a sibset. To test
whether larger families and households had an advantage when it came to
acquiring titles for their members, we include a count of the number of
brothers in the male's sibset, and a count of the number of working-age
males in the household. We expect men in larger households to have had an
advantage because such households appear to have been better off38 and
may also have had more extensive social networks.
We include a variety of other controls to ensure that apparent effects of
the substantively interesting variables are not being driven by changes and
differences in the composition of the population under study. To account
for variation between state-farm systems in the probability of attaining a
title, we included a dummy variable for each state-farm system except one,
Daoyi, which was the reference category. We control for age with a
categorical variable.
To account for temporal trends in the structure of opportunities, we
include controls for year. Visual inspection of the probabilities of
acquiring a title in successive registers revealed that they declined steadily
after 1860, we allowed for a change in slope in that year. To achieve this,
we included two variables.39 One was year, measured from 1800. The
coefficient for this variable reflects the average annual change in the
probability of attaining a title until 1860. The second was 0 until 1860.
After 1860, it was set to the number of years since 1860.40 Summing this
coefficient with the first yields the average annual change in the probability
of attaining a title after 1860.
RESULTS
Secular trends in the chances of attaining a title reflect the declining
fortunes of the Qing state in the latter half of the nineteenth century.

40. In current work we are exploring whether this change in the chances of attaining a title was
associated with a reduction of fluidity by interacting the variable for post-1860 with the numbers
of kin with title.

According to the results for the temporal variables in Table 3, the chances
of attaining a title were stable until 1860. After 1860, the chances of
attaining an official title declined steadily, by about 2 per cent per year.
The implication is that between 1860 and the first decade of the twentieth
century, the chances of attaining a title were more than halved. This decline
was driven by a dramatic reduction in the availability of Banner titles,
which were associated with salaries and other perquisites. The chances of
attaining an honorary title, many of which were purchased, actually
increased.41

Having a father who held an official title dramatically increased the
chances that a male would acquire a title of his own in the near future.
According to the results for model 1 in Table 3, men whose fathers held a
title were approximately eight (e2:09) times more likely to acquire a title by
the next register than other men. This strong effect persisted in models 2
and 3 even after we controlled for the possession of titles by other kin, thus
it is not attributable to the tendency for men whose fathers had titles to be
from prominent families where many senior kin held titles. If that were the
case, the addition of controls for other senior kin would have diluted the
effect for father.
The existence of other senior kin who held titles also improved the
chances that a male would obtain one, even if they lived in other
households. According to the results for model 3, each co-resident paternal
uncle with a title increase the chances of obtaining one by 44.8 per cent.42
Non-co-resident fathers' cousins with titles had an essentially identical
effect: each one raised the chances of obtaining a title by 47.5 per cent. The
strength of the influence of the characteristics of nonresident kin on
mobility outcomes is remarkable given the finding in Campbell and Lee43
that being related to someone with a title only increased the chances that a
male would marry if the kin holding the title lived in the same household.
It appears that a prominent relative living in another household was more
useful when acquiring a title than when acquiring a wife.
Being the son of someone with a title, however, was no guarantee of
obtaining one. Table 4 presents the chances of obtaining a title by age fifty

sui for men from different backgrounds, calculated from simulations based
on the results for model 3 in Table 3. According to these results, slightly
more than one-third of the men whose fathers held titles could expect to
acquire a title of their own. Even the relatively few men who were
fortunate enough to have more than one senior kin with a title were not
certain of obtaining one. Only half of the men who had both a father and
an uncle with a title would obtain one themselves. The chances were
similar for men who had both a father and a father's cousin who held titles.
Men appeared to need at least three senior kin with titles before their own
probability of obtaining a title reached two-thirds.
Comparison with the few relevant published results suggests that the
sons of holders of official titles in rural Liaoning experienced no more
downward mobility than the sons of privileged urban residents in North
America before the twentieth century.44 In other words, elites elsewhere
were as successful or more successful than the Liaoning elites at
transmitting their status. Thus, analysis of a sample of men in the United
States whose records in the 1880 and 1900 censuses were linked, revealed
that nearly 60 per cent of men whose fathers held white-collar occupations
in 1880 were themselves in white-collar occupations in 1900.45 In Boston
during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, between 51 and 71
per cent of the sons of men with high white-collar occupations ended up
with an occupation in the same stratum as their fathers.46 In Hamilton,
Canada during the middle of the nineteenth century, 67 per cent of the
sons of men involved in clerical or professional work ended up doing such
work themselves.47 Only in Poughkeepsie was downward mobility for the
children elites as high as in rural Liaoning. Only 35 per cent of the sons of
men in high white-collar occupations ended up in that stratum
themselves.48
The sons of rural Liaoning elites also seem to have been more likely to
experience downward mobility than their urban European counterparts.
In England during the last half of the nineteenth century, 42.8 of the sons
of men in the highest occupational class ended up in that class
themselves.49 In Frankfurt, Germany, during the middle of the nineteenth
century, 77.6 per cent of the sons of merchants were themselves merchants,
44. Obviously, the largely urban populations referred to here are not the ideal comparison group
for evaluating the rigidity of rural Liaoning society. Comparison with rural populations would
be preferable. We are still in the process of locating relevant published results for non-Chinese
rural populations, and hope in a future revision of this paper to incorporate such results.

and 46.5 per cent of the sons of professionals were professionals.50 In
Toulouse, France, during the middle of the nineteenth century, nearly
two-thirds of grooms of bourgeoise parentage were themselves
bourgeoise.51 In Norwich, England, during the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, between 50.3 and 65.7 per cent of the sons of men in the
merchant elites were themselves members of the merchant elite.52
At least in rural Liaoning, therefore there is little evidence to support
Hymes's claim53 that the availability of help from distant kin made
Chinese society more rigid than the association between fathers' and sons'
outcomes would suggest. Indeed, high rates of downward mobility among
the children and nephews of titleholders created opportunities for men
from undistinguished backgrounds. Table 5 presents distributions of
family backgrounds for the men who acquired titles, based on predicted
probabilities for actual observations. According to these results, almost
two-thirds of the men who acquired titles had no senior kin with a title.
Only slightly more than one-sixth were the sons of men with titles. The
remaining one-sixth consisted of men who had more than one senior kin
with a title.
Compared to elites in North America, therefore, office holders in rural
Liaoning were as likely or more likely to be ``new blood''. In the United
States, 28.5 per cent of the young men who were white-collar in 1900 were
the sons of men who had been white-collar in 1880.54 In Hamilton,

high white-collar occupations were the sons of men in such occupations.57
Comparison with European populations yields similar conclusions. In
Frankfurt, 46.8 per cent of sons who were merchants had fathers who were
merchants, and 52.5 per cent of sons who were professionals had fathers
who were professionals.58 In Toulouse, France, between two-thirds and
four-fifths of sons who were bourgeoise were of bourgeoise parentage.59
In Norwich, England, between 56.7 and 83 per cent of the sons who were
in the merchant elite had fathers in the same category.60 In England during
the last half of the nineteenth century, 57.1 per cent of the men in the
highest occupational class were the sons of men in that class.61
Holding the characteristics of senior relatives constant, some house-
holds nevertheless appear to have been better at securing opportunities for
their sons than others. There was pronounced clustering of title attainment

among related men of the same generation living in the same household.
Table 6 presents results from an analysis that includes as explanatory
variables counts of the numbers of brothers, cousins, and second cousins
with official titles. Every additional brother with a title more than doubled
the chances of obtaining one. Every additional co-resident cousin with a
title increased the chances of obtaining one by 24.6 per cent. Kin of the
same generation but living elsewhere appear not to have had any effects;
thus, this appears to have been largely a household phenomenon.
Clustering effects appear to have been most important for the men who
were at higher risk of obtaining a title because of their parentage.
According to the predicted probabilities in Table 7, 45 per cent of men
who had both a father and a brother with titles would obtain one. In
contrast, only 30 per cent of the men who had a father but no brothers with
a title would obtain one, a 15 percentage-point disadvantage. While the
proportional effect of a brother with a title was just as strong for men
whose fathers had no title, the absolute effect was much weaker, so that
having a brother with a title yielded only a 5 percentage-point advantage.
Since the effects of clustering were concentrated among the men who were
already predisposed to acquire a title by their parentage, a replication of
the calculations in Table 5, not shown here, show that the proportion of
title holders who have no kin with titles declines only slightly when
brothers and cousins are accounted for.
One implication of this clustering was that for a man with a title, having
many surviving sons was not necessarily an efficient strategy for ensuring
that at least one son acquired a title. Additional sons had a much smaller
effect on the chances that at least one would obtain a title than would be
the case in the absence of clustering. Table 8 presents the results of an
examination of title attainment among sets composed of brothers surviving
at least to age forty. It presents the percentages of sets where at least one

brother obtains a title, distinguishing by size of the set and whether or not
the father held a title. According to these results, if a man with a title had
one son who survived into his early forties, there was a 34.8 per cent
chance that he would acquire a title. If a man with a title had two surviving
sons, however, there was only a 40.6 per cent chance that at least one
would have a title. These numbers are very different from the ones
expected if the chances of attaining a title were independent of sibset size
and not subject to clustering. If that were the case, 38.4 per cent of only
sons would acquire titles, and 62.1 per cent of brother pairs would include
at least one brother with a title.62

We have demonstrated that longitudinal, nominative data from population
registers has considerable potential to open up a new avenue of inquiry in
the analysis of social mobility. We expanded the focus from the father­son
dyad to the extended family, including nonresidential kin. By linking
individuals to their distant relatives, including those living in other
households, and using the measured characteristics of those relatives as
explanatory variables, we carried out an analysis of social mobility that
properly accounted for the potentially important role of kin other than
parents and siblings. We were able to translate influential claims about the
role of kinship networks in social mobility in historical China into testable
hypotheses, and evaluate them.
While our specific interest was in accounting for the potential
importance of distant kin in mobility outcomes in a Chinese setting, these
results should be of general interest because of the novelty of our
approach. To our knowledge, comparable studies that consider the
potential effects on mobility outcomes of senior kin other than the father
and grandfather are extremely rare, not just for historical societies, but for
contemporary societies as well. We have demonstrated here that even
when the characteristics of father and grandfather are controlled for,
effects are apparent for other senior kin. As similarly detailed and
voluminous household register data for other historical societies become
available, we look forward to comparison with results from the replication
of these calculations. Such comparison would help assess whether the
effects of senior kin reflect the distinct characteristics of kinship networks
in historical China, or are typical for historical societies. In the absence of
comparable results from elsewhere, we cannot answer this question, only
offer these results as a baseline for comparison for future studies.
Our most important substantive finding, of course, is that kin other than
the father influenced mobility outcomes in Liaoning. Having an uncle or a

father's cousin with a title raised the chances of obtaining one. Inheritance
of status, in other words, could be indirect. Even more importantly, we
found that characteristics of kin living in other households mattered for the
acquisition of a title, even though in a previous analysis we found no
evidence that they influenced key demographic outcomes such as the
chances of ever marrying.63 Prominent kin living in other households may
have been a useful form of social capital when it came to acquiring a title,
but not when it came to acquiring a spouse. Kinship networks beyond the
household, in other words, may have been more important as a source of
social capital than as a source of economic capital.
Rural Liaoning nevertheless appears to have been as open as many other
historical populations for which it has been possible to analyze social
mobility, if not more so. The sons and other junior kin of title holders were
as likely or more likely to experience downward mobility than the sons of
elites in selected North America and European populations. Even though
having a title increased the chances that a son or other junior kin would
acquire one, in other words, it was by no means a guarantee. Conversely,
even when we allowed for the possibility of indirect inheritance, for
example from men to their nephews, the proportion of the elites who were
``new'' was as high as in the European and North American populations to
which comparison were made. At least in this part of China, the emphasis
on merit in the allocation of titles by the state appears to have overridden
tendencies towards nepotism and particularism.64
The claim that weak associations between the outcomes of fathers and
sons exaggerate the openness of historical Chinese society by failing to
account for the tendency of networks of kin to monopolize oppor-
tunities65 appears not to be correct. While some families were especially
successful at transmitting status from one generation to the next, the effects
of characteristics of senior kin on outcomes were too weak to guarantee
success for the junior kin in prominent families. Though Liaoning was but
one part of China, and the population studied here was a distinct subgroup
within Liaoning, the findings here are likely to be relevant to other parts of
the country, since, as noted in Lee and Campbell66 and Ho,67 the ideology
of advancement according to individual merit was a long-standing and
pervasive feature of Chinese society.
