Abstract
Background: Few data have been published on the validity of classification of overweight and
obesity based on self-reported weight in representative samples of Hispanic as compared to other
American populations despite the wide use of such data.
Objective: To test the null hypothesis that ethnicity is unrelated to bias of mean body mass index
(BMI) and to sensitivity of overweight or obesity (BMI >= 25 kg/m2) derived from self-reported (SR)
versus measured weight and height using measured BMI as the gold standard.
Design: Cross-sectional survey of a large national sample, the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III) conducted in 1988­1994.
Participants: American men and women aged 20 years and over (n = 15,025).
Measurements: SR height, weight, cigarette smoking, health status, and socio-demographic
variables from home interview and measured weight and height.
Results: In women and Mexican American (MA) men SR BMI underestimated true prevalence
rates of overweight or obesity. For other men, no consistent difference was seen. Sensitivity of SR
was similar in non-Hispanic European Americans (EA) and non-Hispanic African Americans (AA)
but much lower in MA. Prevalence of obesity (BMI >= 30 kg/m2) is consistently underestimated by
self-report, the gap being greater for MA than for other women, but similar for MA and other men.
The mean difference between self-reported and measured BMI was greater in MA (men -0.37,
women -0.76 kg/m2) than in non-Hispanic EA (men -0.22, women -0.62 kg/m2). In a regression
model with the difference between self-reported and measured BMI as the dependent variable, MA
ethnicity was a significant (p < 0.01) predictor of the difference in men and in women. The effect
of MA ethnicity could not be explained by socio-demographic variables, smoking or health status.
Conclusion: Under-estimation of the prevalence of overweight or obesity based on height and
weight self-reported at interview varied significantly among ethnic groups independent of other
variables.

Introduction
Obesity, a prevalent and well-established risk factor for
cardiovascular disease and diabetes, has been rising in
prevalence over recent decades in the United States [1-7].
In 1999­2000, 64% of U.S. adults were found to be over-
weight or obese, an absolute increase of 8 percentage
points from 1988­1994 [5]. Hence surveillance of obesity
prevalence is of great public health interest. Because of the
high costs of examination surveys, much of the surveil-
lance of obesity is based on self-reported height and
weight data, particularly at the state and local level. A
number of studies have reported the validity of self-
reported weight and height and BMI computed from them
in populations of European extraction in the US and else-
where [8-19]. A recent report noted lower validity of self-
reported hypertension in Mexican Americans than in non-
Hispanics [20]. However, data are lacking on the validity
of self-reported obesity data in the growing Hispanic
American population.
Therefore a study was done to test the null hypotheses that
there is no association of ethnicity with the validity of BMI
or "overweight or obesity" determined from self-reported
height and weight and that the estimated measure of asso-
ciation of ethnicity with validity of self-reported over-
weight or obesity is not confounded by age, gender,
education, marital status, region, smoking, and health sta-
tus in the American population. Data on a large, multi-
ethnic, national sample of adults from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)
were examined.
Methods
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) was conducted in 1988­1994 on a
nationwide multi-stage probability sample of 39,695 per-
sons from the civilian, non-institutionalized population
aged 2 months and over of the United States excluding
reservation lands of American Indians. Mexican Ameri-
cans and African Americans were oversampled. Of these,
30,818 (78%) were interviewed and examined. Details of
the plan, sampling, operation and response have been
published as have procedures used to obtain informed
consent and to maintain confidentiality of information
obtained [20,21].
Demographic data, years of education completed, medi-
cal history including self-assessed health status and
behavioral information including smoking history were
collected by household interview. Participants chose race
and ethnicity categories from a card with categories
including Mexican American (MA)[21]. Later in the
household interview, interviewers asked, "How tall are
you without shoes?" (inches) and "How much do you
weigh without clothes or shoes?" (pounds). This occurred
before they invited participants to take part in an exami-
nation and told them they would be measured and
weighed.
Examinations were carried out in a mobile examination
center. Technicians measured height to the nearest 0.1
centimeter, weight to the nearest 0.01 kg, as described in
detail elsewhere [21-23]. Body mass index was computed
(BMI = weight/height2, kg/m2). Obesity was defined as
BMI >= 30.0 kg/m2. Overweight or obesity was defined as
BMI >= 25.0 kg/m2 [5]. Extensive descriptive data on
height, weight, BMI, and obesity prevalence have been
published elsewhere and will not be duplicated here [23-
26].
Statistical analysis
Of 33,994 interviewed persons, 31,311 were examined
(78% of original sample). After exclusion of 14,281 per-
sons under age 20y, 268 pregnant women, and persons
with missing height or weight by self report or examina-
tion, 15,025 remained for this analysis. Self-reported
height and weight were available for over 90% of persons
with measured height and weight data. For stratified anal-
ysis, a cut-point of 60+ was used because persons 60+
were oversampled. Weighted descriptive statistics and
measures of association were computed using the SAS
[27-29]. The number of true positives (TP), false positives
(FP), true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN) were
used to calculate sensitivity = (TP/(TP+FN))100, positive
predictive value (PPV) = (TP/(TP+FP))100, specificity =
(TN/(TN+FP))100, and predictive value negative (PVN) =
(TN/(TN+FN))100. The BMI difference (error) was com-
puted by subtracting the self-reported value from the
measured value. Multivariate linear regression was used
for models with BMI difference as a continuous depend-
ent variable. All models controlled for age in years. All sta-
tistical testing and variance estimation were performed
using the PROC REGRESS procedure for regression mod-
els in the SUDAAN system, which takes the complex clus-
ter design of the survey into account [30,31].
Results
Table 1 compares prevalence of overweight or obesity
(BMI >= 25 kg/m2) based on BMI computed from self-
reported height and weight with that based on BMI com-
puted from measured height and weight. In women, prev-
alence is consistently and substantially underestimated by
self-report data, most markedly among MA both in abso-
lute and relative terms. This was also true of MA men. For
other men, no consistent difference was seen. Table 2
shows estimated prevalence of obesity (BMI >= 30 kg/m2)
by self-report versus measurement. Prevalence is consist-
ently underestimated by self-report, the gap being greater
for MA than for other women, but similar for MA and

other men. The gap was greater in women than men but
varied little with age.
Tables 3 and 4 show test characteristics for the classifica-
tion of overweight or obesity based on BMI calculated
from self-reported height and weight by age, gender and
ethnicity. Sensitivity was similar in non-Hispanic
European Americans (EA) and non-Hispanic African
Americans (AA) but much lower in MA. Sensitivity was
also lower in persons aged 60 years and over than < 60
years and in women than men. The highest sensitivity was
in younger EA men (93%) and the lowest in older MA
women (69%) (Table 3). PPV was similar across ethnic
groups. It was higher in older persons and women. PPV
was highest in older EA women (98%) and lowest in
younger AA and MA men (89%).
Specificity was highest in EA and similar in AA and MA
(Table 4). It was higher in women than men and in older
than younger men, but varied little with age in women.
The highest specificity was in older EA women (98%) and
the lowest in younger MA men (82%). In men, PVN was
similar in EA and AA but much lower in MA within age
groups. It was higher in younger than older men. In
women, PVN was highest in EA, intermediate in AA and
lowest in MA. It was higher in younger than older women,
and lower than in men among AA and MA, but not EA
women. The highest PVN was in younger EA women
(91%) and the lowest in older MA women (51%).
The effect of smoking status, a possible effect modifier, on
sensitivity of overweight or obesity based on self-reported
height and weight was examined (Appendix Table A1, see
Additional file 1). No consistent effect was seen in men. In
women, sensitivity tended to be slightly higher in younger

non-smokers than in smokers, but higher in older smok-
ers than non-smokers, the difference being large only
among older Mexican American women (smokers 82%,
non-smokers 66%).
The percentages not overweight by self report (BMI < 25
kg/m2) with measured BMI >= 25 kg/m2, i.e. false
negatives for overweight or obesity, among men and
women by age, smoking and ethnicity were examined
(Appendix Table 2, see Additional file 1). Rates of false
negatives by self-report were slightly higher in non-smok-
ers than in smokers, and in MA than in AA or EA. False
negative rates were also higher in older than in younger
persons and in less educated than more educated persons
(not shown).
Tables 5 and 6 show the test characteristics for self-
reported data for classifying persons as obese (BMI >= 30
kg/m2). The pattern is similar to that for overweight or
obesity. A few exceptions are the similar sensitivity and
PVN but lower PPV in MA men compared to other men.
The mean difference between self-reported and measured
BMI was greater in Mexican Americans (men -0.37,
women -0.76 kg/m2) than in non-Hispanic EA (men -
0.22, women -0.62 kg/m2). In a regression model with the
difference between self-reported and measured BMI as the
dependent variable and MA ethnicity as the exposure
variable and controlling for demographic variables or
demographic variables plus smoking and health status,
MA ethnicity was a significant predictor of BMI difference
(Table 7).
An examination of mean differences between measured
height and self-reported height indicated that MA men
reported themselves to be 0.59 cm, EA men 1.47 cm and
AA men 1.16 cm taller than measured. Over-reporting was
greater at age 60+y than <60y, e.g. MA 60+ 2.00 cm, 20­
59y 0.44 cm. MA men reported themselves to be 0.51 kg,
EA men 0.26 kg and AA men 1.09 heavier than measured.
Thus underestimates of overweight prevalence in MA men
were due to over-reporting of height rather than underre-
porting of weight.

In women, MA reported themselves to be 0.51 cm, EA
0.26 cm and AA 1.09 cm taller than measured. Over-
reporting was greater at age (years) 60+ than <60; e.g. MA
60+ 3.02 cm, 20­59 0.92 cm. MA women reported them-
selves to be 1.07 kg, EA women 1.21 kg, and AA women
1.58 kg lighter than measured. Under-reporting of weight
was greater at age 20­59 than at 60+; e.g. MA 20­59, 1.18
kg; 60+, 0.28 kg. So underestimates of overweight preva-
lence in each group of women was due primarily to under-
reporting of weight at younger ages and both to over-
reporting height and under-reporting weight at older ages.
Discussion
Overweight/obesity is one of the leading preventable
causes of death in the United States and most industrial-
ized countries [1-7,23-26,32-34]. After release of national
data from NHANES III (1988­1994) showed striking
increases in US obesity prevalence among children and
adults compared to earlier surveys, it was widely recog-
nized that an "epidemic" was occurring [23-26]. Therefore
monitoring of the prevalence of obesity by interview sur-
veys, such as the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)
and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS), which rely on self-reported data, have assumed
even greater importance than previously [34]. Yet, all cur-
rent guidelines for the diagnosis and management of
obesity are based on measured height and weight.
Over-sampling of the MA population and availability of
measured as well as self-reported height and weight data
in NHANES III made it possible to evaluate the ethnic var-
iation in validity of self-reported data. NHANES III data
show that using self-reported data produces consistent
underestimates of the prevalence of overweight and obes-
ity (BMI >= 25 kg/m2) in MA by up to 21 percentage
points and of obesity (BMI >= 30 kg/m2) by up to 14 per-
centage points (Table 1). Criteria for deciding whether SR
data are to be considered valid will depend on the appli-
cation and on a number of factors including statistical test
characteristics and expert judgement as discussed at length
elsewhere [35]. However, these data suggest that self-
reported data for MA are not sufficiently valid for use in
producing such estimates and are suspect for etiologic
research. Further research is needed determine the appli-
cability of these findings to data from telephone inter-
views or self-completed questionnaires.
At a mechanistic level, the important underestimate of
BMI and hence overweight and obesity prevalence in
NHANES in women was due primarily to under-reporting
of weight at younger ages and both to over-reporting
height and under-reporting weight at older ages. Possible
explanations for under-reporting of weight in women
have been discussed [8-19]. In MA women and men, these
may include recall bias and lack of information because of
no recent measurements at home or by health care provid-
ers. This is important for both weight and height, since
stature declines with age in older persons by up to 2 cm
per decade after age 30 [8]. Lack of access to scales and
health care and/or lack of utilization of either may be due
to barriers such as cost, transportation, language or
cultural factors. Poorer validity of self-reported hyperten-
sion has been noted in MA, perhaps for similar reasons
[20]. Further, if obesity and short stature are seen as
socially undesirable, a conscious or unconscious tendency
to under-report body weight and over-report height may
occur even if true weight and height are known. On the
other hand, MA women have been reported to be less
likely to perceive themselves as overweight and more sat-
isfied with body size than non-Hispanic EA women in
some, but not all studies [36-39]. Specifically in NHANES
III, participants were asked, "Do you consider yourself
now to be overweight, underweight, or about the right
weight?" Hispanic women and men were more likely to
under-assess their overweight status than non-Hispanic
EA; e.g. 31% of overweight Hispanic women said they

were "about the right weight" compared to 14% of non-
Hispanic EA [37].
Comparisons with previous reports
NHANES III is one of the largest studies to provide popu-
lation-based data on the validity of prevalence estimates
based on self report and one of the first to provide such
data for Mexican Americans. Two previous reports were
based on a nationally representative sample of US adults.
One used NHANES III data to assess the effect of age on
validity of self-reported data [8]. Under-reporting of
height and consequently BMI bias was higher above age
60 than below. However, data from all ethnic groups were
combined. The present report demonstrates important,
consistent ethnic differences between MA and other
groups. Patterns of reporting error in weight by gender
and age were similar in NHANES II and III [8,9]. A non-
significant effect of race ("white"/"black") on reporting
bias for both weight and height was observed in NHANES
II. In European and Australian adults, height was over-
reported and weight under-reported, producing under-
estimates of BMI and obesity prevalence [15-19]. An
exception was the under-reporting of both weight and
height in Scotland leading to BMI and prevalence esti-
mates slightly higher than from measurement [10]. Brazil-
ian adults reported height and weight with small errors
that differed by gender [11]. In studies of American ado-
lescents, height was over-reported and weight and conse-
quently BMI and obesity prevalence under-reported [14].
The latter two studies did not describe ethnic variation.
One report indicates that correction equations do not
eliminate systematic error in self-reported BMI [40]. Com-
parisons of self-reported and measured BMI in etiologic
research was beyond the scope of the present paper [41].
Among these studies, self-reported height and weight
were obtained by in-person interview in several
[8,9,11,13], by telephone interview [18], and by self-com-
pleted questionnaire others [10,14-17]. No study used
more than one of these methods for self-reported data.
Quantitative comparisons of error magnitude of self-
reported data among studies are not possible due to vary-
ing designs, analytic methods, and reporting. A large Brit-
ish survey that used a self-completed questionnaire found
mean differences between self-reported and measured
BMI that ranged for -0.55 in women 35­49 years to -1.13
in men 60+ years, somewhat larger than in NHANES. An
Australian telephone survey found differences in preva-
lence of overweight or obesity (percentage points) of -23
in men and -15 in women, much larger than those see in
EA in NHANES. Variation in differences by ethnicity was
not examined in other studies.
Limitations and strengths
Several unavoidable limitations of the present study
include possible bias arising from survey non-response
and from missing values for some variables. Several spe-
cial studies of NHANES III data have indicated little bias
due to non-response [42]. The 2 to 4 week time lapse
between ascertainment of self-reported data and meas-
ured data is unlikely to affect the difference in this adult
population [8]. Compared to interview surveys such as
NHIS or BRFSS, error in self-reported height and weight
might be underestimated in NHANES III if subjects were
aware before the interview that they would be weighed
and measured during the subsequent examination and
hence might be less likely to misstate height and weight.
At the time of the home interview when participants
reported their current height and weight, participants had
not been invited to the NHANES III examination or told
that the examination would include height and weight
measurements. However, because of pre-survey media
publicity or explicit questions asked of interviewers, some
participants might have known or assumed they would
later be measured and weighed. It is not possible to deter-
mine what effect, if any, this may have had on height and
weight reporting.
Confounding by variables not controlled for cannot be
excluded. However, given the uncertainty about the exist-
ence or nature of the association, it is unclear which other
variables should be controlled for as confounders. The
number of tests was restricted to those of weighted regres-
sion models. The representativeness of the sample and the
use of sample weights provide generalizability of the
results to United States non-institutionalized population
of the same ages, but not necessarily to Mexico or other
nations or smaller US ethnic groups such as Cubans.
In order to monitor overweight prevalence in Cuban and
Puerto Rican Americans and American Indians using
interview survey data, replication of the current findings
in these groups is needed. Participants might be asked
when their weight and their height were last measured
and by whom. The validity of self-report data obtained by
in-person interview, telephone interview, and self-com-
pleted questionnaire should be compared to establish
generalizablity of validity estimates from the former to the
latter two. Trends in validity over time should also be
sought in MA using more recent surveys and related to
possible correlates.
Conclusion
Self reported height, weight and BMI in Mexican Ameri-
cans may not be of sufficient validity for use by public
health agencies and they underestimate obesity preva-
lence in women of all ethnic groups.
