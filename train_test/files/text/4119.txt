Brokerage roles between cliques: a secondary clique analysis
Elisa Bellotti
Abstract
A common goal when analyzing a social network is to try and determine the cohesive subgroup structure of the network.
Some techniques result in complex overlapping structures such as cliques or k-plexes whereas others either partition the
network or place actors into unique groups, for example factions or components. A standard method implemented in
Ucinet uses the overlapping structure to construct a proximity matrix which can be submitted to a clustering routine to
find non-overlapping groups. Once the groups have been determined many analysts relate these to observations they have
made involving their data. There are few techniques that take the groups as a starting point for additional analysis with
the exception of Krachardts work on Simelian ties. In this paper I examine the roles the actors play in the cohesive
structure using the brokerage ideas of Gould and Fernandez. The method is demonstrated on an original dataset that was
collected in 2006 on 100 social services based in a suburb area of Milan, Italy. The dataset is composed of a matrix that
contains directed data collected by asking the spokesperson of every social service if he/she knows the other services
listed (the list of services having been previously compiled using several sources), together with attribute information.
The matrix is analyzed using the clique analysis techniques in the Ucinet software package to find non-overlapping
groups. The results are submitted to Ucinets brokerage routine and visualized using the Netdraw software package. This
analysis offers a new insight into the data, as it is possible to identify what actors play important roles (and which kind of
role) in bridging the gaps between the cohesive subgroups.
Key words: social networks, subgroups, brokerage, clique analysis
Introduction
Much work has been done to identify cohesive substructures in networks. Scholars have proposed several
methods which look at partitions, like factions or components; which search for cohesive structures, like
cliques, n-cliques (Luce and Perry 1949), n-clans, k-plex (Seidman and Foster 1978), lambda sets (Borgatti,
Everett and Shirey 1990); or which simply assign actors to specific groups, like core or peripheries (Borgatti
and Everett 1999), again based on how much these substructures are cohesive or not. But there are few
techniques that take these cohesive subgroups as a starting point for further analysis. One recent exception is
Krackhardts work on simmelian ties, which explores the possibility of analysing actors roles between groups
Bellotti / Methodological Innovations Online 4 (2009) 53-73 54
(Krackhardt 2007) using the E-I index (Krackhardt and Stern 1988).This technique reveals who within a
network connects different subgroups in terms of being related not only to people who are strongly embedded
in cohesive substructures, but also sending ties to other subgroups. This secondary analysis is interesting, but
it shows some weakness I will address in this paper.
Here I want to propose a new way to analyse a network structure that combines two well known techniques:
clique analysis and brokerage roles. While these methods are certainly not new, the combination of the two is
somehow innovative and offers meaningful insights as it shows not only which actors are embedded in
cohesive subgroups and who plays important roles of mediation but also describes what kind of roles these
are. The method is demonstrated on an original dataset that was collected in 2006 on 100 social services based
in a suburb of Milan, Italy.
The paper also addresses a theoretical claim which will need further work to be empirically tested but shows
some potential. The idea is to combine two classic and opposite theoretical standpoints from within the social
capital debate: collaboration VS competition and public VS private goods. Here I want to see how these two
different perspectives can be combined and coexist within the same social structure.
The first section of the paper offers an overview of the theoretical background on Krackhardts ,,simmelian
ties and Gould and Fernandes ,,brokerage roles in order to see how is it possible to combine the two
methods and what are the limits of these techniques. The second section briefly describes the organisation of
social services in Italy, explaining how it has changed in recent years and why we need new and more
sophisticated research methods if we are to explore its structure. The third section describes the research
project and the data collected, which are analysed in the following section using the method proposed. In the
last section I discuss the findings, address theoretical issues and suggest furthers areas of exploration which
are needed in order to give strength to the proposed technique.
Background theory
The ,,simmelian tie is a useful concept that has been proposed by Krackhardt in several articles. In the very
first paper (Krackhardt 1998) he builds upon Granovetters idea of strong ties (1973), which focuses on dyads,
extending the concept to triads by way of a discussion of Simmels analysis of differences between dyads and
triads. The latter, Krackhardt observes, allow actors to play several roles not permitted in dyadic interactions.
According to Simmel (1983), triads are different from dyads because they are characterised by reduced
individuality, reduced individual power and moderated conflict. Krackhardt also notes how implementing the
number of actors up to more than three does not change the formal features of the structure, thus he focuses on
triads as his units of analysis. Thus, Krackhardt concludes that «the key to understanding the quality of a tie
between two actors can be reduced to asking whether it is part of a strong triad or not» (Krackhardt 1998: 24).
He then proposes the definition of simmelian ties, which are ties reciprocated and reciprocally connected to at
least one third person. As he points out, this concept resembles the one of clique, defined by Luce & Perry
(1949) as a maximum subgraph connecting at least three nodes. Because the Ucinet (Borgatti, Everett and
Freeman 2002) routine that is used to extract cliques needs symmetrical data as an input1, we can further
specify that simmelian ties are ties embedded in cliques that are extracted after symmetrizing the data at the
minimum level (therefore selecting only reciprocated ties).
Even more interestingly, Krackhardt statistically demonstrates that «simmelian ties are "sticky" ­ that is, they
will last longer than other forms of merely strong ties», and that «simmelian ties will occur with greater
frequency than would be expected by chance, given the overall structure of the relations» (Krackhardt 1998:
25). This means that simmelian ties, even following a stricter definition than asymmetric or sole symmetric
ties (the latter are defined as reciprocated ties not embedded in cliques, see Krackhardt 1999: 186), are
«backed up by the normative power of the groups, providing stability beyond that experienced by bridges or
isolated dyads» (Krackhardt 1998: 35).
1 This is because ties have to be symmetric in order to fit into the clique definition of a maximum subgraph.
Bellotti / Methodological Innovations Online 4 (2009) 53-73 55
In a subsequent paper Krackhardt (1999) goes further, comparing simmelian ties analysis with Burts (1992)
conception of structural holes effects. While Granovetter has stressed the importance of the quality of the tie
(strong or weak) in order to provide advantage to the individual, Burts analysis only concerns if a tie is a
bridge or not, arguing that bridging ties, independently of strength, are less constraining on the actor than non
bridging ties. Krackhardt disagrees with Burts interpretation, because he sees people who act as bridges
between cohesive subgroups as constrained by as many sets of rules as the number of groups they belong to.
With the concept of simmelian ties the author demonstrates that people embedded in triads are committed to
the triadic forces described by Simmel (reduced individuality, reduced individual power, moderated conflict)
thus the more subgroups they are embedded into the more constrained they are by these forces. Krackhardt
(1999) goes further arguing that his analysis works better when people play public roles, while Burts analysis
is more suitable for private roles. Here the claim goes to a theoretical level, as the author is trying to make a
statement about the outcome of individual structural roles in terms of social capital.
Krackhardt analyses the constraint effect of cliques within an organization in the Silicon Valley (1992; 1999)
where employers started a union certification drive. He found that people occupying a position of mediation
were constrained regarding the expression of their personal point of view due to the fact they belonged to
different subgroups; thus the information flow was reduced through structural holes rather than being more
effective, as Burt says in his theory of brokerage roles. But Burts analysis is informed by a concept of social
capital as a private and scarce good, which is hard to get and stimulates competition between actors. The
Krackhardts scenario is far more complex than that, as in Silicon Valley there were actors collaborating for
the same goal (the union certificate) and competing for different standings (to approve it or not). If we see
social capital as a private good that is produced by personal relationship via strategic interactions then it is
easier to describe relationships in terms of competitiveness. But such a situation is not always true, as there
are many situations in which actors are embedded in social structures that need both competitiveness and
collaboration, whose outcome in terms of social capital is both private and collective. I will go back to this
point in the next section, where I describe the contemporary scenario which Italian social services are dealing
with.
Recently, in his keynote address at the UK Social Network Conference (2007)2 Krackhardt has proposed to
use the E-I index - defined as the number of ties external to the groups minus the number of ties that are
internal to the group divided by the total number of ties (Krackhardt and Stern 1988) - on simmelian ties. This
method allows us to explore which actors play important roles of mediation between groups. As such it is both
interesting and useful. But it does not allow us to describe what kind of role, and furthermore does not take
into account structural holes. It could therefore also be distorted by redundancy in ties.
Here I want to improve upon and develop Krackhardts insights by using Gould and Fernandez measures of
brokerage roles (1989) applied to non overlapping cliques: clique analysis and brokerage roles can be seen in
similar terms, as cliques can be defined as transitive triples (because they are formed by reciprocal ties), while
«any brokered exchange can be thought of as a relation involving three actors, two of whom are the actual
parties to the transaction and one of whom is the intermediary or broker» (Gould and Fernandez 1989: 91) and
moreover «brokerage represent an intransitive triple» (Ibid: 97). The authors propose a classification of the
forms of brokerage relations that is «an exhaustive listing of the possible types of two-step paths on which any
actor may lie, and it is thus an exclusive and exhaustive partition of any actor j's total raw brokerage score tj
»
(Ibid: 101). They identify five types of roles, according to the direction of the ties and the groups actors
belong to. In a situation where a sends a tie to b who sends a tie to c and there are no ties between a and c, the
five possible brokerage roles of b are:
- Coordinator: a, b and c belong to the same group.
- Itinerant broker (consultant): a and c belong to the same group, while b belongs to a different one.
- Gatekeeper: a and b belong to the same group, while c belongs to a different one.
- Representative: b and c belong to the same group, while a belongs to a different one.
- Liason: all the actors belong to different groups.

Bellotti / Methodological Innovations Online 4 (2009) 53-73 56
The standard method implemented in Ucinet (Borgatti, Everett and Freeman 2002) calculates how many times
every actor in a network plays these brokerage roles between groups, giving the total amount of brokerage
roles as well. Thus it is possible, once the groups are determined, to explore not only if an actor plays a
brokerage role, but also what kind of role s/he is playing and within which groups: given the fact that groups
here are cohesive subgroups formed by simmelian ties, this method allows to analyse a network looking only
to relational data, without using nodes attributes (which are normally used to define groups when looking for
brokerage roles) unless for a secondary interpretation of the findings.
The importance of proposing a technique that focuses on ties rather than on nodes does not lie only on a
methodological level. It has theoretical significance. The social capital debate has been dealing with this
aspect since its very first formulation by Bourdieu (1992) and Coleman (1998), the first claiming that social
capital is a private resource that people strategically accumulate from the network of relationships they are
embedded into, the second assuming that social capital is an unintentional public outcome of human
collaboration. Bourdieus view concerns actors, while Coleman tries to shift the attention to ties. But it has
been Putnam, with the distinction between bonding and bridging ties (Putnam 2000), who has definitely tried
to move the analysis from actors to ties.
But Putnams theory has not defined what is actually exchanged through these social capital ties, as the
distinction between bonding and bridging rests on the ideas of homophily and heterophily. Bonding ties occur
between people in similar situations, while bridging ties connect people in different positions. While the
description of the output of these ties does refer to the content of exchange (as bonding ties are useful for the
development of reciprocity and solidarity, while bridging ties are valuable resources of innovation), the way in
which the author looks at them is based again on actors attributes, either a quality or a position of the actor.
Also Lins idea of homophily and heterophily (2001) is affected by the limit of considering actors and their
position rather than the real exchange that flows through ties. As Barbieri (2005) pointed out, while Lins
theory seems to consider social capital in terms of material and non material resources exchanged within a
network, when Lin measures individual social capital with the position generator method he takes into account
the positions an actor can occupy mobilising his or her contacts, thus using a status rank.
The method I propose here is built only on relations, as it looks at transitivity within triples (cliques), and
intransitivity between non overlapping cliques. The outcome gives a definition of the position an actor
occupies within a network and his or her consequent role, but this definition entirely depends on the ties this
actor is embedded into.
The scenario: third sector and social capital in Italy
The research I present here was led by the Centre for the Study of Fashion and Cultural Production of Catholic
University of Milan for the social cooperative A77 that addresses substance abuse amongst young people. The
cooperative requested a map of the network of social services in a suburb of Milan where it operates: the
purpose of the map being to give the cooperative a valid instrument for directing people with a dependency
problem to the right service, assuming that dependency is never a problem related to a single aspect of people
lives, but needs a multidimensional approach in order to avoid fragmentation of care. Especially when dealing
with youth, it is important to involve the complete network of people (adults and peers) the person is in
contact with. Carers need to activate a network of intervention, which takes into account the individual in all
his or her needs, from school, to work, free time, health services and so on. This also requires the carer to have
the adequate resources for suggesting the right service (or several services) that can help the individual in
facing different aspects of his or her problem. Relying on other services does not mean passing the
responsibility of an intervention to another service but rather activating nurturing collaborations between the
public, private and non profit services within a local territory.
Thus, the problem for the cooperative can be reduced to a lack of coordination between the different social
services of a suburb, a problem that is related to the shift from the welfare state to what has been called the
third sector. Folgheraiter (2006) describes this shift as a change from the right to be assisted, typical in a
welfare state, to the duty of feeling good, where the social system has to offer standardised and rationale
services sustainable from an economic point of view. The rationalisation of the system needs specialised
Bellotti / Methodological Innovations Online 4 (2009) 53-73 57
services that can be sold on the market of the new welfare, in which the policy buys social work according to
an optimization of budget and resources. This shift from the right to be assisted, that needed a welfare state, to
the duty of feeling good, which is based instead on the market optimisation of the social services, has
produced an increasing distance between social policy and social work. The first is concentrated into making
laws that optimise the system, creating quality standards and dealing with the budget, while the second is
fragmented into a multiple micro reality where there is a lack of a general view and of coordination.
The general idea is thus that social work is just the executive aspect of social policy, without a general
overview and the capacity of planning at the macro level. Furthermore, consumerism has infected the social
system, as services are seen as pre-made and standard goods that can be sold on the market, while according
to Folgheraiter (2006), a helping offer, as social capital, can be produced only by social relationships. The
social capital perspective here is the one of Coleman (1998), who intends it as an emergent good that is
produced by the network of relationships and goes beyond the individual interest becoming a public good
whose effects spread on the entire community.
Folgheraiter (2006) describes the contemporary Italian system of welfare as a «quasi-market», as the
government (national as well as local) assure free interventions for citizens, granting everyone the right of a
social and health system, but it buys these services on a semi market that is organised and controlled by policy
makers via outsourcing and commitment. This mixed logic (of public welfare and semi-private market) has
lead to an increased competition between the social services, as they have to win funding and prove quality,
but the quality standards are based on the process of services (how much does it cost? How long does it take?)
more than on products (is it actually effective? Does it improve the life standard of problematic people?). Also
the author notes that the main idea behind a welfare system is to offer ready-to-go solutions, in terms of a full
package of intervention that weaken the individual and collective ability of problem solving. This means that
the welfare system has weakened social capital, meaning that the capacity to activate a network of
relationships when facing a problem is reduced.
In such a situation, social network analysis is the right instrument not only to map the various connections
between the social services, but also to identify the roles of actors within the network.
The data
The data I present were collected in autumn 2006 for a research project commissioned by a social service
(A77) that deals with any kind of addiction and it is based in a suburb of Milan. The purpose of the project
was to map the network of all public and private institutions and firms that offer any kind of activity and
support for youths. Because A77 deals with addiction, the main goal of the research was to map all the
services can address the complex needs of problematic youth, according to the idea that a good intervention
can be effective only when it activates the complete network a person is embedded into.
The research involved two phases:
1. I identified all services that offer youth activities and support in the suburb of Milan where A77 operates.
This search was conducted by Internet as well as through examination of archives for any kind of service that
corresponded to research criteria (i.e. served young people aged between 15 and 30 years old).
2. I sent a questionnaire to every service mapped in the first phase (the initial number was 127, but I cut it
down sampling some of the categories, like churches and gyms), asking for details on the kind of service
(public, private, non profit), the average number of people served, the kind of activities offered. This
information has been coded as attributes, according to:
a. The kind of service (kindser3): these are coded as following:
1. churches
3 We code the kind of attribute with a tag that reminds the nature of the attribute. These are the tags we will use during analysis in
referring to a specific kind of attribute.
Bellotti / Methodological Innovations Online 4 (2009) 53-73 58
2. psychological services
3. sporting clubs
4. cultural and artistic centres
5. social coop
6. instruction and education institutes
7. youth clubs
8. international cooperation (one case)
b. The institutional typology (type):
1. profit
2. non profit
3. public
4. religious
c. The age of people served (age, see Table 1). Even if I selected services according to the young age of
people addressed, some services do address also adults as well as elderly people:
Table 1: age of people served
Code Category From To
1 All ages 0 99
2 From late infancy 10 99
3 Adults 25 50
4 Children ­ Teenagers 5 25
5 Children ­ Youth 6 40
6 Elderly 50 99
d. The kind of problems the services address (problem):
1. Children with familiar problems
2. Marginalised people (homeless, illegal immigrants)
3. Drug and alcohol addicted
4. Foreigners
5. Disabilities
6. Non problematic people
e. The activities offered (activ): these are listed in a affiliation matrix, where rows are social services and
columns are activities, like courses in painting, writing, reading, DIY, dance, yoga, foreign languages, Italian
language, theatre, music, cinema, computer, as well as psychological counselling, legal counselling, school
support, job an school orientation, family support, religious meetings, peer aggregation.
Next I listed all the services and asked participants to indicate which they knew. I also asked if they knew
other similar services. This latter question generated 50 new names that I added to the original list and
resubmitted to all participants. In some cases it was not possible to obtain data, as services refused to answer
the questionnaire (one case) or, as public services, they needed special authorization from the city council that
would take too long. I thus collected data on 100 social services, for which I construct an adjacency (actor by
Bellotti / Methodological Innovations Online 4 (2009) 53-73 59
actor) matrix containing data on the knowledge each service has of all the others; I call this matrix the
knowledge network. An analysis of the knowledge network is an important preliminary step to an analysis of
collaborative and other stronger ties. It is firstly important to see if individual service providers are aware one
of the other, as they would never be able to activate collaborations if they do not know that other services exist
in the area.
Then I asked these services if they ever collaborate together: again, the data on the 100 social services were
stored in a matrix that I called the collaboration network. This network is more interesting in terms of social
capital, as it reveals the size of existing collaborations, thus ties here are more meaningful than the simple
knowledge network. The problem is that it is not possible to apply the method I want to propose on this
network, because as I previously said, brokerage roles can be measured only for directed data, for they entail,
by definition, intransitive triples. The collaboration network I mapped is indeed directed, but the lack of
symmetry in ties is due to the fact that some services (especially bigger or older ones) might not remember all
the collaborations they activated in the past, while smaller or newer services will probably recall more
outgoing ties. But collaboration is by definition a symmetric tie, as it is not possible to collaborate with
someone who does not collaborate back. Due to the fact brokerage roles cannot be measured for this network,
I decided to apply the method only on the knowledge matrix.
This generates another limitation in the analysis, as we should assume that in order to be brokers people must
be aware of their role. By definition, a broker is someone who plays an intermediary role between two others,
and the term originally refers to a business context, even if it can be used more widely, including the senses of
jobber, agent, factor, or commission-agent. Here I stretch the sense of the term referring to anyone who is in
the middle of a structural hole (Burt 1992) no matter what is the context. What I am looking for here is then
the potential role some services can play in order to increase the collective awareness of the local offer, as
well as their strategic position within the network in terms of competition against same kind of services. The
brokerage roles here are then intended as potential key roles in terms of diffusion or control of the circulation
of information.
Method and findings
Before analysing the network in order to find brokerage roles between cohesive subgroups it is useful to run
some preliminary analysis that describes the overall structure of the network. The knowledge network
activates only the 15% of possible ties but 93 out of 100 nodes belong to the strong component, and the
average distance is 2.3 nodes. Thus, even with a low density, the knowledge network is somehow well
connected, as most of its nodes are reachable by others with an average short path.
As the goal of the analysis is to reveal the structure for potential synergies, I then analyse densities between
different groups, where these groups are defined by nodes attributes. First of all I calculate the average value
of density between different kinds of services (kindser), see Table 2:

The density matrix, partitioned by the kind of service, shows that psychological services seem to know better
social cooperatives (activating the 29% of the possible ties) and youth clubs (25% of possible ties); on the
other hand, social cooperatives know better psychological services (26%), sporting clubs and cultural and
artistic centres (22%), instruction and education institutes (39%) and youth clubs (38%). Finally, youth clubs
know better social cooperatives (33%). Indeed diagonal values (indicating awareness of same kind of
services) are not dramatically high, but they are still higher than other values, especially regarding social
cooperatives (45%), instruction and educational centres (45%) and youth clubs (38%). Values for group 8 are
not significant as there is only one service belonging to this group.
Average values of density partitioned by the institutional typology of centres (type) are shown in table 3:
Table 3: Density / average value within blocks (type)
Profit Non profit Public Religious
Profit 24% 6% 11% 7%
Non profit 13% 18% 10% 13%
Public 22% 11% 23% 17%
Religious 9% 11% 3% 23%
Bellotti / Methodological Innovations Online 4 (2009) 53-73 61
Here values (also diagonal ones) are even lower than before, meaning that the public sector, as well as the
private, the non profit and the religious one again enjoy only a poor knowledge of the existence of other
services, even within the same category as them.
Finally Table 4 shows average values of density partitioned by the age of people served (age):
Table 4: Density / average value within blocks (age)
All Late inf. Adults Child/teen Child/youth Elderly
All 15% 14% 10% 17% 16% 3%

Child/teen 12% 16% 19% 29% 12% 0%
Child/youth 13% 9% 6% 12% 13% 0%
Elderly 16% 9% 25% 6% 11%
Here we can notice that only services addressed to adults and elderly are aware of each other, meaning there is
not intergenerational contact. Services for children and teenagers show the highest value on diagonal, meaning
that they are aware of the local offer for people of this age.
Looking at densities partitioned by attributes, while interesting, does not allow us to explore the specific role
of every actor within the network. Moreover, it is based not on the structure of the network, but on actors
attributes. The method I propose here allows us to overcome these two main problems, as it refers only to
relational data and gives details of each actors roles. The method implies several steps: the first step is to
identify and select symmetrical (reciprocated) ties only, discarding non-reciprocated ties for the purposes of
this analysis. This step is mandatory because cliques are by definition maximally complete subgraphs, and if
there are directed and non symmetric ties the subgraph would not be maximal. Because the ties are
symmetrised and embedded in cliques, they can be considered as simmelian ties, or transitive triples. The
subsequent step consists into submitting the matrix to Ucinet routine that analyses cliques. This routine allows
setting the minimum size of the clique: a good way to run clique analysis is then to find the best size of
cliques in order to reveal a structure where the number of cliques is not too high and it does include as much
nodes as it can. Thus I set the minimum size of cliques at 4, and I found 18 cliques which involve 33 out of
100 nodes.
Ucinet then automatically submits the clique output to hierarchical clustering to find non overlapping cliques,
which means intransitive triples. Figure 1 shows the hierarchical clustering of overlap matrix. We can now
visualise the actor by actor co-membeship matrix via Netdraw (Borgatti 2002) where the size of the ties
represent the number of cliques two nodes share in common (see Figure 2). If we do not consider isolates, we
see that the network has two main components showing a very interesting structure. There are nodes
connecting different parts of the network, acting as bridges between denser parts. An isolate position here
does not indicate that these services do not activate any ties, but only that they do not activate simmelian ties.
Thus it is arguable that there would be services within cliques groups and outside them (isolates) that can act
as bridges in the network.

Bellotti / Methodological Innovations Online 4 (2009) 53-73 63
In order to reveal these bridging roles, I decided to start from the clique structure and identify these positions
using the measure for brokerage roles. Gould and Fernandez technique for identifying brokerage roles is
based on the idea that brokers connect people according to the groups they belong to: thus I decided to divide
the network into groups according to the non overlapping clique structure. Using the hierarchical cluster
analysis of overlapping cliques (each comprising 4 nodes) I select the level on which we can identify the
maximum number of towers (that is level 1, which means that people clustered in the same tower share an
average of 1 clique together, see Figure 1) and assign a number to people belonging to the same tower.
At level 1 we find 9 groups:
1. Sporting clubs
2. Sporting clubs
3. Supporting services for problematic youth dedicated to solidarity actions
4. Youth clubs (youth clubs and leisure services)
5. Schools and education services
6. The public drug addiction centre and a youth club
7. A youth club and a public library
8. Disabilities centres
9. Arts associations
Isolates are joined in group 0, as they do not belong to any clique overlap structure. Figure 3 shows the
previous actor by actor co-membership matrix, where nodes have been shaped according to the 9 non-
overlapping groups (plus group 0) and the size of ties represents the number of cliques two nodes have in
common. If we now visualize the original knowledge network and colour the services according to the clique
groups they belong to (Figure 4), we have an overview of the whole network and the clique structure
embedded in it. We can thus search for services that activate simmelian ties (meaning they are well connected
within their own group) but at the same time are in a good position to mediate or control the circulation of
information between other groups and, more importantly, between services that do not belong to any cohesive
substructure.

As the density and clique analyses have shown, services tend to know other services if they are similar or they
offer similar activities. For our purposes, this situation is not useful when dealing with problematic youth, as
they should be able to activate links with services that offer different activities and different support.
Moreover, cliques involve only 33 out of a 100 nodes, meaning that the 67 isolates do not belong to any
cohesive substructure and do not activate many symmetric ties. This means that social services could surely
improve the circulation of information regarding local services, investing in services that can spread such
information around the network. These services can be identified through the brokerage role analysis applied
on cohesive substructures, in a way in which well connected nodes can act as bridges between different
cliques and these cliques and isolates. On the other hand, the analysis of these roles, given the features of
every service, can help to clarifying whenever a service could possibly have an interest into increasing the
flow of reciprocal knowledge between services (like in the case of the committee, whose aim is to know
different service where to address problematic youth) or could actually prefer to keep information for itself,
like in the case of market oriented services (like gyms) that can use their knowledge of the local offer as an
advantage against competitors.
The Gould and Fernandezs brokerage routine gives two main outputs: the first one summarises brokerage
roles scores of every actor, providing the total number of times they play a specific role as well as the sum of
all the roles (see Table 5). The second output provides detailed scores about which groups every actor plays a
specific role between. Table 6 reports an example of this second output, calculated for the Sporting Club
Nuova Canottieri Olona, which belongs to group 1.

Every role has its own meaning. Being the coordinator means that the service in a group is known by others
and knows others itself: such a role within the isolates group is useful to increase (or not) the reciprocal
awareness of the group, as services in this position could let (or stop) information circulating in the network.
Representative services instead receive (and send4) ties within their own group but only send ties outside the
group, thus they are good resources to let (or to stop) the actors of the group to be known by others.
Gatekeepers only receive ties from outgroups, meaning they can favor (or control) circulation of information
within their own group. Consultant services receive and send ties to actors in the same group that is different
to the one they are embedded into: they can thus increase or not the cohesion of other groups. Being a liaison
involves sending and receiving ties between two different groups that are both different from the one the actor
is embedded itself: again, this could mean increase or not of the cohesiveness of the whole network.
Discussion
I can now analyse the roles of every actor within the network. The first thing we notice is the low values on
coordination roles for every group: this is expected, as nodes are well embedded within their groups, which
represent overlapping cliques. Some of the low values (for examples in group 4, for Comunità Nuova nd
Paspartù) are explained by the fact that cliques have a minimum size of 4 nodes, and groups were selected
taking services which shares at least one clique in common. This means that not everyone in the group has to
share all the cliques with the other three in its clique, and between different cliques there could be the space
for a coordination role.
Within every group is it possible to identify a leader, who has the highest values for most of the roles: for
group 0 (people who do not share any clique in common and are visualised as isolates) the leader is Don
Orione, a catholic church which offers services for youth, the elderly, and handicapped women. Don Orione
has the highest values on coordination within its own group. Due to the fact that the goal of the church is to
increase social support within the local community, we can interpret its coordinative role in terms of
mediation between the group, as it can spread awareness of the local service to other services that seem to be
fairly isolated in the area. The representative role is lead by Institute Cavalieri, a public school that at level
0.571 of hierarchical clustering joins group 5 (school and education services). The Institute is then a good
resource of connection between fairly isolated social services and the local educational system. Again, the role
of the school can be understood in terms of mediation, as it is not in competition with other schools in the area
(that have a different educational offer). Thus we can suppose that the institute could easily pass information
to others in its group regarding educational services in the area. The gatekeeping role is covered mostly by
Sporting Club S. Ambrogio, which is dedicated to sport courses including gym, volley, judo, basketball. This
club joins group 1 (sporting clubs) at level 0.171: here this role can be intended as a source of advantage in the
competitive field of local private sporting clubs, because the gatekeeper role allows the club to control
information flow between group 0 and group 1 and to strategically limit contacts between other competitors
sporting clubs and the isolated services. The sporting club S. Ambrogio covers the same gatekeeping role with
group 8 (disabilities centres). This last group will tend to contact the sporting club when it needs to address
handicapped youth to sport activities. The same sporting club shows higher values on liaison, confirming its
strategic position within the network, while within group 0 there are no significant values for the consultant
role. Note that Don Orione, Institute Cavalieri and Sporting Club S. Ambrogio, regardless of the significance
of their position in terms of collaboration VS competition, play very important roles in front of group 0, as
they allow and/or control information flows within the group and between other groups; the loosely connected
group 0 (which is the most numerous groups, with 67 nodes) needs such brokers to improve its connectivity.
Group 1 (sporting clubs) is entirely dominated by Nuova Canottieri Olona (see Table 6), a multifunctional
sporting centre offering courses in swimming, fitness, tennis. The centre shows high values of liaison between
group 0 (isolates) and group 5 (educational system), group 0 and group 8 (disabilities centres) and group 2
4 All the services embedded in cliques do have, by definition, symmetric ties within their own group. Thus when they play
representative or gatekeeper roles we have to keep in mind that these roles are counted because they mostly receive or mostly send ties
outside of their groups, while inside of them they both send and receive ties. This is also the reason why apart from isolates (where
services are not embedded in cliques) these structures show very low values in terms of coordination, as in these structure actors are
reciprocated and reciprocally connected to a third part (simmelian ties).
Bellotti / Methodological Innovations Online 4 (2009) 53-73 67
(sporting clubs) and group 0. This means it is in a strategic position from which it can pass information
between isolates, the public educational system and the sector dedicated to handicapped youth. Also, as we
can see from Figure 3, group 1 shares a variable number of cliques only with group 2, as well composed by
sporting clubs. In this case we can suppose that the liaison role between group 2 and group 0 facilitates control
of information, as the group 2 sporting clubs are located very close to Nuova Canottieri Olona (especially
Canottieri Olona, which is in the same street and has a very similar name, thus the two could also be
confused). Here the liaison position allows Nuova Canottieri Olona to gain a strategic advantage over the
other sport services.
Group 2 comprises the swimming pool Solari, which has the highest values on consultancy (between group 0)
and liaison (especially between group 0 and group 1 and group 0 and group 8) and Canottieri Olona, another
sporting club specialised in tennis and rowing which shows high values on gatekeeping with group 0. This
group shares an average of 0.829 cliques with group 1. Here all the roles can be interpreted as controlling the
information flow, especially regarding group 0. The special relationship between group 8 (disability centres)
and all sporting clubs is easily understood as disability centres always offer a sport program to their users, and
chose the sporting centre according to availability and closeness.
The group 3 leader is La Cordata, a solidarity social cooperative born in 1989 from a group of practitioners of
Agesci (a catholic association of boy scouts) dedicated to marginalised youth. It offers many kinds of
activities and structures, from youth and student hostels to family support. It has a consultancy role for group
0 (isolates) and group 5 (educational services), it represents its own group in front of groups 0, 1 and 2
(sporting clubs), 4 (youth clubs) and 5. It is a gatekeeper between groups 0, 4, 5, 6 (drug addiction centre) and
9 (art associations). Therefore it occupies a very strategic position, but due to the non-profit nature of the
service we can possibly interpret its role in terms of increasing collaborations rather than competition.
Group 4 (youth clubs) is dominated by Comunità Nuova, a non-profit association dedicated to drug addicted,
marginalised youth and immigrants. It has high values on consultancy for group 0 and on liaison between
group 0 and other groups, therefore it can potentially increase cohesiveness of the isolates. It is also the
coordinator and the representative of its own group in front of all the other groups except groups 2 and 6. An
advantage of the method presented in this paper is that it is possible to verify if there are other services that
can act as representative for groups that are not connected to the leader. This is the case with Paspartù, ad
educational centre that shows higher values for group 6 and CD Giambellino, a multifunctional youth club
that has higher values in front of group 2. Therefore these are the centres group 4 needs to turn to in order to
gain information on the public service of drug prevention and sporting clubs.
Group 5 is composed by educational institute and the social cooperative A775, dedicated to prevention of
addiction. Here brokerage roles are better distributed, as the gatekeeping is covered by A77, representative
and consultancy by Institute Giorgi and liaison by the high school Marconi, which also shows higher value on
total brokerage score.
In group 6 gatekeeping and consultant roles are taken by Ser.T, the public drug addiction service, while Cedag
Irda, a youth club that offers education and family support shows higher values on representative and liaison
roles. The high indegree value of Ser.T can be explained by the fact that all the other local services address
youth with addiction problem to the public health services, which receives more ties than it sends out.
Within group 7 we find youth club S. Paolino, dedicated to recreational activities and specialised in a
representative role between its group and group 0 and liaison roles between group 0 and group 1 (sporting
clubs), group 0 and group 8 (disability centres), and group 4 (youth clubs) and group 0. We also find the
public library S. Ambrogio, with higher values on gatekeeping and consultancy for group 0. As we can see,
there are many services that can improve the information flow within group 0 and between this group and the
others, thus increasing the connectivity of the whole network.
Group 8 is composed of centres for handicapped people and Il Balzo, a non profit association that offers
courses of art and dance especially for handicapped people. The double vocation of Balzo (art and voluntary
5 A77 is also the research commitment.
Bellotti / Methodological Innovations Online 4 (2009) 53-73 68
work for handicapped people) is expressed by its brokerage role between its group and group 9 composed of
cultural, theatre and art association and dominated by Comuna Baires. This is an Argentinean association that
promotes artistic activities like tango dance, painting and theatre.
Focusing the attention on social services that are able to activate ties outside their own cohesive subgroups
allow us to discuss two different but correlated aspects of social capital. In the quasi-market of Italian welfare
the public, private and non profit services compete against each other for economic funding to invest in
projects and increase newcomers. In this perspective a brokerage role can be an advantage in terms of
controlling information flows from different local resources. Being a gatekeeper, like in the case of Nuova
Canottieri Olona, a private sporting club, can be strategically relevant for an increment of clients, because
when other services need to address their users to a sporting club they will turn to the one they know better.
Here social capital is intended as a strategic resource whose outcome is a private good in terms of higher
profit. Whereas the goal of other public, private, non profit and religious services is not only to increase the
profit through public funding, but also to offer a network of differentiated resources to problematic youth.
They still have to compete against similar services for economic financing, but they also have to activate a
collaborative network to address youth with multiple needs. In this case a general view of the local network of
social and cultural services is essential to transform the awareness of the local offer into possible
collaborations, that can be a valid source of social capital, where here social capital is intended as the product
of collaborative relationships whose effect covers the entire community as the final beneficiaries are youths.
In this perspective a brokerage role does not entail only personal and private advantages, as Burt says, but also
collective benefits, as it produces social capital in terms of public good.
Conclusions
In this paper I analysed the brokerage role of social services that are able to activate different resources from
cohesive subgroups. I combined two well known techniques, clique analysis and brokerage roles, on an
original dataset in order to highlight who, within the network of social services in a local area of Milan, can
count on strategic positions and can activate different resources from the ones embedded within cohesive
subgroups. From a theoretical perspective, we saw how these resources can be used to develop collaborations,
whose effects in terms of social capital are considered public as they spread on the whole community. On the
other hand they can be used for private advantage in competitions for new customers and funding, where the
social capital perspective is the one of Burts, whose effects are interpreted as private and strategic goods.
From a methodological perspective, the strength of the method lies in the fact that brokerage roles are counted
between groups which are formed according on relationships instead of attributes, thus the technique is based
only on structural and relational properties instead of individual properties or attributes.
While the method seems to show some potential, something has to be said on the whole study: the way in
which I collected data does not allow to explore the quality of the ties mapped. Knowing another service, as
well as developing collaborations with it, does not mean that the relationship is positive and can lead to a
stable tie: there could be the case in which two services know each other and already collaborate, but they
might not be satisfied by the reciprocal work. My data do not permit to predict if the ties I found will produce
further contacts, thus we will need longitudinal panels which reveal whose connections within the network are
strong in terms of indicating reciprocal respect and continuous collaborations. This is not a secondary matter,
as dealing with problematic youth needs long lasting interventions and commitment by the services network.
Also, I did not provide a grading scale of the kind of knowledge, thus the ties do not describe only one
specific kind of relation, as they can be intended as superficial knowledge as well as reciprocal deep
awareness.
Moreover, I do not know if brokers are aware of their position and use their strategic resources intentionally:
what needs to be done is to qualitatively explore the self perception of services occupying different positions
in the network, to give an account to the perceived positions and the advantage or constrains they implies.
Further research in these directions could reveal the strength of this method and show how being embedded in
cohesive subgroups and acting as brokers could have different meaning for actors involved.
