Bank Risk Taking and Competition:
Evidence from Regional Banking Markets

Abstract
This study investigates the bank competition-stability nexus using a unique regulatory
dataset provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank over the period 1994 to 2010. First,
we use outright bank defaults as the most direct measure of bank risk available and
contrast the results to weaker forms of bank distress. Second, we control for a wide
array of different time-varying characteristics of banks which are likely to influence the
competition-risk taking channel. Third, we include different measures of competition,
contestability and market power, each corresponding to a different contextual level of
a bank's competitive environment. Our results show that the degree of competition
affects bank risk in different ways; some of them with stability-enhancing effects, but
others apparently not. In a second step, we investigate the role of bank competition in
the transmission of monetary policy to bank risk bank. We show that loose monetary
policy translates into a lower overall probability of bank distress. Banks with a higher
degree of market power measured by the Lerner index are less reactive to monetary policy
shocks. Conversely, the Boone indicator suggests that banks located in markets with less
competitive pressure react stronger to interest rate changes. From a policy perspective,
our findings indicate that competition-reducing regulation does not necessarily enhance
the stability individual banks or the resilience of banks to macroeconomic shocks.

1 Introduction
The effect of bank competition on the risk taking behavior of banks has been at the center of
a discussion among regulators, policy makers and researchers for a long time. Until recently,
the general consensus among policy makers and researchers has been that market power gives
banks proper incentives to behave prudently. The central aim of prudential bank regulation
to reduce banks' risk taking incentives therefore often coincides with restricting competition
among banks. Accordingly, the banking industry has been exempted from competition law
for a long time (Carletti & Vives (2008)). In recent years, however, several theoretical and
empirical studies have challenged the view that monopoly power mitigates bank risk taking,
instead arguing that higher competition among banks leads to lower levels of bank risk.
The recent financial crisis, which has also been triggered by excessive bank risk taking, has
again heightened interest in the relationship between competition among banks, bank market
structure and banking stability.
The competition-bank risk taking nexus has been extensively analyzed in the theoretical
banking literature. The predictions emerging from the theoretical models are ambiguous,
however. Models such as those of Keeley (1990), Allen & Gale (2004), Matutes & Vives
(2000), Hellmann, Murdock & Stiglitz (2000) and Wagner (2010) all predict that fiercer com-
petition among banks will result in higher bank risk taking. The intuition behind the result
is straightforward: High market power at the bank level is associated with high monopoly
rents which the bank manager wants to protect by investing in safe assets. By reversing the
line of argument of the above models, Boyd & De Nicolo (2005) show how higher competi-
tion among banks might lead to a reduction in the overall level of bank risk taking: Higher
competition reduces interest rate costs at the level of the borrowing firm, leading the firm
to choose a safer project which ultimately generates safer banks. Martinez-Miera & Repullo
(2010) build a model which predicts that the effect of bank competition on bank risk taking
is non-linear. Their model shows that under specific circumstances higher bank competition
first increases bank risk taking and then reduces bank risk taking. Their model thus predicts
a reversed u-shaped relationship between bank competition and bank risk taking.
Besides the theoretical literature, there is abundant empirical work examining the effect
of bank competition on stability and bank risk. One strand of empirical research uses large
aggregated cross-country datasets. Beck, Demirguc-Kunt & Levine (2006), using a logit
probability model, find that more concentrated banking systems are less likely to experience
a banking crisis. At the same time, however, more competition also reduces bank risk. In
a similar model, employing the Panzar and Rosse H-statistic as a measure of competition,

Schaeck, Cihak & Wolfe (2009) also find a negative relationship between the likelihood of
a systemic banking crisis and the competitiveness of the banking system. Another set of
research uses (cross-country) bank-level data to examine the relationship between competition
and individual bank risk. Boyd, De Nicolo & Jalal (2007) find that less-concentrated banking
markets are characterized by lower z-scores, an inverse measure of bank risk. Jiménez, Lopez
& Saurina (2007) find no relationship between credit risk and market concentration but a
positive effect of competition on credit risk, supporting the competition-fragility hypothesis.
Schaeck & Cihak (2012) find a positive relationship between higher competition and bank
capital ratios. Inasmuch as better capitalized banks can be considered less risky, these results
confirm the competition-stability hypothesis. Berger, Klapper & Turk-Ariss (2009) find that
competition in the loan market has a mitigating effect on credit risk. They also analyze
the effect of competition on overall bank risk and banks' capital ratios where they find
competition to increase overall bank risk and decrease capital ratios. Finally, Schaeck &
Cihak (forthcoming) find in general a negative effect of competition on bank risk for European
countries.
In this study we aim at adding to the empirical literature analyzing the compe-tition-
/concentration-risk trade-off by using bank-level data for all German banks. One of the key
challenges in the attempt to identify the effect of competition and concentration on bank risk
empirically lies in defining the relevant market for each group of banks. Existing empirical
evidence generally assumes that the relevant market for a particular bank in a given country is
the country itself. This implies that each bank in a given country stands in direct competition
to all other banks in the country. While true for large, multinational banks which compete
directly with one another in many markets, this assumption seems unrealistic for the majority
of banks which operate in regional banking markets.
We improve on the existing literature by allowing competition to affect banks operating in
different markets in distinct ways. We use a total of three concepts to measure competition,
corresponding to three different dimensions at which competition might affect the risk-taking
behavior of banks. First, to approximate the ability of banks to generate rents by pricing
its products over their marginal costs, we compute bank-specific efficiency-adjusted Lerner
indexes. Second, the vast majority of banks in Germany belong either to the cooperative
banks sector or to the savings banks sector. These banks are by law geographically limited in
their scope of activities.1 Our dataset provides us with detailed locational information for all
German banks ("three-pillar system") so that we can exploit this special characteristic of the
German banking industry to clearly define the relevant market for each specific bank in our
sample.2 For each banking market we compute measures of concentration and contestability
of the banking market. It is already a stylized fact that measures of concentration and
competition are distinct features affecting banks in different ways. Third, we compute Boone

of bank headquarters and their branches for all institutions in the German universal system.

indicators for the next contextual level above the relevant market for banks (see also Schaeck
& Cihak 2010). Although most German banks do not run branches outside their home county,
there is nothing stopping a business customer or a depositor from choosing a bank outside
that particular county. The Boone indicator measured at the federal state level captures
exactly this characteristic of bank market competition.
Another important issue in empirical studies analyzing the relation between risk taking
and bank competition is identifying the correct measure of bank risk. Most bank-level studies
proxy bank risk with either some sort of credit risk (i.e., the ratio of non-performing loans
over loans), or by the z-score introduced by Boyd & Runkle (1993). While the z-score
can be interpreted as the number of standard deviations by which a bank is removed from
insolvency, the non-performing loans ratio focuses on credit risk only. However, neither of
these risk indicators considers actual bank distress and bank failure events, which are without
doubt the most appropriate concepts to define bank risk. Our measurement of bank risk is
comprised from the distress database collected by the German central bank. This dataset
contains information on bank-level distress events that range from weak incidences to forced
exit by means of restructuring mergers or bank moratoria. Hence, our measurement of bank
risk directly captures the possibility of outright bank defaults. We are not aware of any study
employing actual failure events as dependent variable to investigate the competition-bank risk
nexus and we believe this is an important step forward toward a better understanding of the
underlying mechanisms.
In a second step, we use our empirical model to shed light on the role of bank competition in
the transmission of monetary policy shock to bank risk. There exists an increasing empirical
literature suggesting that loose monetary policy increases the incentive to engage in riskier
new investment, while at the same time reducing the risk of banks' outstanding investments.
The effects of monetary policy on bank risk seems to depend on the bank characteristics: low
liquid, smaller and less capitalized banks seem to react strongest to changes in the interest
rate. We test for hypothesis that the degree of market power influences the behavior of
banks in response to monetary policy shocks. The model of Dell'Ariccia, Marquez & Laeven
2010, for instance, implies that the effect of monetary policy shocks on bank risk should be
stronger for banks with low market power. Intuitively, a change in the market rate is reflected
stronger in bank interest rates the lower the banks' market power of a specific banks. Hence,
banks with low market power have a stronger incentive to engage in riskier investment after
a reduction in the policy rate.
Our paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we present the data and the methodological
approaches to measuring bank competition at different contextual levels and to analyzing the
bank risk taking-competition nexus. In Section 3 we present the main results of our empirical
model before concluding in Section 4.

2 Methodology and Data
2.1 Data
Our analysis covers the German economy and its banking system over the period 1994 to
2010.3 Bank balance sheet data are collected from the unconsolidated balance sheet and
income statement reports which all banks report to the Bundesbank annually. Our measure
of bank risk is constructed from the confidential distress database. We complement the bank-
level data with macroeconomic data at the county level obtained from the German Federal
Statistical Office. We apply a very thorough merger treatment to the dataset: After the
merger of two banks we artificially create a third bank (for the time after the merger) in the
dataset.4
Measuring Bank Risk
Most existing empirical studies investigating the relationship between bank competition and
financial stability at the microeconomic level focus either on credit risk alone, using some
form of credit risk measure such as non-performing loans, or resort to bank risk measures
constructed from balance sheet information, such as a z-score. Bank risk measures con-
structed from balance sheet information, however, have the disadvantage that they do not
provide information on actual distress events, or even outright failures of banks. Our mea-
sure of bank risk is comprised from the distress database collected by the Bundesbank. This
dataset contains information on bank-level distress events that range from weaker incidences
such as capital support measures by the deposit insurance schemes to outright bank defaults
(i.e., bank moratoria or takeovers in the banking market which are classified by supervisors as
"distressed mergers"). Hence, our measurement of bank risk directly captures the possibility
of banks exiting the market because of distress events. According to Aspachs, Goodhart,
Tsomocos & Zicchino (2007), the probability of distress is a much more appealing bank risk
statistic because, by covering all types of risk, it provides a more exhaustive picture of risk
borne by the banking system.
We consider two different concepts for defining bank distress: first we construct an in-
dicator for broader bank distress events (Bank Distress),5 as well as one more narrowly
defined indicator for banks exiting the market in a distressed merger or in a moratorium
3Note that we lose one year of data by setting the analysis in a forward-looking perspective, that is by
forwarding bank distress and bank default events by one year with respect to the explanatory variables.
4Note that the merger treatment causes the total number of banks in the dataset to exceed the maximum
number of banks in a given time period.
5The indicator comprises (i) capital support measures by the deposit insurance schemes in Germany,
(ii) takeovers classified by the Bundesbank as restructuring mergers, as well as (iii) bank moratoria. Therefore,
the bank distress indicator applied in this study is more narrow (i.e., focusing on more severe distress events)
than, for example, the indicators applied in Kick & Koetter (2007) and Jahn & Kick (2011).

(Bank Default). In order to give the analyses a forward-looking perspective, we forward
bank distress and bank default events by one year with respect to the explanatory variables.
Table 1: Distribution of Bank Distress and Bank Default Events
This table presents descriptive statistics for bank default and bank distress events obtained from the distress database
of the Deutsche Bundesbank. The dummy variable Bank Distress refers to a broad definition of distress (including
banks exiting the market in a distressed merger or in a moratorium, but also capital support measures from the deposit
insurance funds), while the dummy variable Bank Default is an indicator for bank default (only comprising banks
exiting the market in a distressed merger or in a moratorium). The variable z-score is calculated as the ln of the ratio
of Tier 1 capital and operating profits of bank i to the standard deviation of operating profits where each position is
measured relative to total assets. Tier 1 capital and total assets are averaged over two years ("mid-point values"); to
account for changes in the volatility of profits over time the standard deviation of operating profits is calculated over
a window of five years. The sample comprises 37,529 bank-year observations on up to 5,035 banks over the period
1994­2010. Note that the z-score can only be calculated for a sub-sample of bank-years (because of the "mid-point"
calculation and the five-year time window).

Measuring Market Power
Lerner Index
We use the Lerner Index to approximate competition at the bank level. The Lerner Index
represents the markup of prices over marginal cost; as such, the Lerner Index is a direct
indicator of the degree of market power. A general definition of the Lerner index is
Lit =
arit -mcit
arit
, (1)
where arit and mcit represent the average revenues and marginal costs of bank i at time t.
Marginal costs are derived from a translog cost function of the following form:
ln(Cit) = +

m n
mn ln(ymit) ln(ynit)+

k ln(wkit) ln(zit)+ t+vit +ui. (2)

Cit represents the production costs of bank i at time t. We assume that production is based on
the factor inputs funding, labor and fixed capital, represented by w1it, w2it and w3it, for each
bank i and time t. We specify three different types of bank output: customer loans, business
loans and securities, represented by y1it, y2it and y3it. We also include bank equity capital
(zit) as further control variable into the translog cost function. vit represents the model error
term and ui the bank-specific inefficiency term. Additionally we allow the production cost to
contain a deterministic time trend  t to capture general technological change. As usual, we
impose homogeneity of degree one in the input prices by dividing all factor prices and total
production cost by the price of fixed capital. The model is estimated using a stochastic cost
frontier approach.
Using Equation (2), the marginal cost of bank i at time t can be calculated as

Concerning the average revenue, it is common to approximate it by the fraction of total
revenue to total assets. However, unlike most other approaches to studying the relationship
between bank competition and bank (in)stability, we explicitly allow for banks using less-
than-optimal production technology. As argued by Koetter, Kolari & Spierdijk (forthcoming),
ignoring possible inefficiencies in the production process might lead to biased estimates for
the Lerner Index. We follow Koetter, Kolari & Spierdijk (forthcoming) and use the sum of
the predicted values for total cost C from Equation (2) and the predicted profits  derived
from the estimation of a profit function dual to the cost function depicted in Equation (2).
The estimation of the standard stochastic profit function delivers predicted values of profits of
bank i (see Berger & Mester (1997)). These predicted profit values, as well as the predicted
costs of the stochastic cost frontier, are net of any inefficiencies and thus proxy the true
average revenue more reliably. To be specific, the average revenue arit in Equation (1) is
computed as
arit =
C +
Total Assets
.
The evolution of our estimated Lerner Index is shown in Figure 1.
Hereby, the point estimates of the median values for each year and for each of the major
German banking groups are depicted. The figure reveals that savings and cooperative banks,
over time, enjoy a relatively stable market power (with cooperative banks having more market
power), while private banks as well as Landesbanks show substantial fluctuation. Interest-
ingly, big private banks have been gaining market power over time, while Landesbanks were
losing such market power until the financial crisis in 2008 but were able to catch up with the
big private banks later on in 2009. Koetter & Poghosyan (2009) depict a similar evolution
of market power for the German banking system based on latent group-specific Lerner Index
estimates.

County-level measures of concentration and contestability
In our analysis we aim to identify bank concentration in the relevant markets (where we
disaggregate our data all the way down to the regional level). Therefore, we refrain from
measuring concentration based on a bank's total assets or total lending for two reasons.
The first reason concerns data availability, as banks' total assets represent balance sheet
information which is available only at the bank level (but not disaggregated by regions). Also,
data on bank lending can only be traced to certain regions using the Bundesbank's credit
register which, however, has a substantial threshold of 1.5 million e. That is, even the use of
lending data from the credit register would cause a substantial bias in the analysis, especially
for small regional banks (i.e., cooperative banks, savings banks, small private banks).
In order to overcome these data constraints, we measure competition by the availability of
bank branches for private and corporate customers in certain regions. Using information on
the location of branches from all German universal banks we calculate the variable Regional
Geographic Reach as the share of branches a given bank has per county; if a bank does
business in several counties, we assign the average branch share per county (weighted by the
bank's number of branches in each county) to the specific bank. 6
6Note that for the adequate calculation of competition measures banks which are known for operating
extremely small branches (e.g., "one-person counters" in shopping centers), are dropped from the analysis.

The Boone Indicator
The central idea behind the Boone Indicator, as proposed by Boone (2000) and Boone,
van der Wiel & van Ours (2007), is that a more efficient bank is more profitable than less-
efficient banks. That is, markets map efficiency differentials into profit differentials. Boone
(2000) is able to show within a broad set of theoretical models that this mapping of efficiency
differentials into profit differentials becomes steeper as competition increases. That implies
that the more competitive the market, the more harshly a bank is punished for inefficiencies
in terms of relative profits. This last result enables the measurement of competition via the
the response of profits to changes in marginal costs.
The economic argumentation behind the idea of measuring the degree of competition by
analyzing the relationship between profit and efficiency ratios is based on the selection effect
of competition stressed by Vickers (1995). This line of thinking holds that "competition
causes efficient organizations to prosper at the expense of inefficient ones" (Vickers 1995,
p.1). Boone (2000) argues that this selection effect is constituted by the reallocation effect
of competition. A rise in competition reallocates output from less-efficient to more-efficient
banks, measured by marginal costs. Firms with lower marginal costs are able to offer their
product at a lower price. Increasing competition allows efficient banks to use their cost
advantage more aggressively, which draws customers away from banks with higher marginal
costs. This effect increases the output of more-efficient banks. It is this reallocation of output
that raises the profits of efficient banks relative to less efficient competitors.
The above discussion supports the following log-linear relationship between relative profits
and relative efficiency, measured by marginal costs (see also Boone, van der Wiel & van Ours
(2007)):
ln(ijt) = +jt ln(mcijt) (4)
where ijt, mcijt indicate the time t profit and marginal cost of bank i located in federal
state j.7 The Boone Indicator, given by the parameter jt, measures the effect of changes in
marginal costs on profits. The specification in logs allows us to interpret the Boone Indicator
as elasticity. As indicated by the subscript jt, we estimate the above regression separately for
each federal state and for each year. The Boone indicator thus varies between federal states
and over time.
The Boone indicator jt should generally be negative. Regardless of the degree of com-
petition, banks with higher marginal costs are expected to realize relatively lower profits.
Furthermore, changes in competition over time should result in appropriate changes in the
Boone Indicator jt. This means that, according to the idea that the negative relationship
between marginal costs and profit is steeper in more competitive banking markets, the Boone
7Marginal costs are calculated, based on the estimated parameter of the translog cost function given in
Equation (2), as shown in Equation (3).
9
Indicator jt should take on higher values in absolute terms (i.e., more negative values) when
competition increases.
We have argued above that for the majority of German banks the relevant market is indeed
the county the bank is headquartered in. However, although a German savings bank normally
does not run branches outside its county of domicile, there is nothing stopping a customer
or depositor from choosing a bank outside the respective county. Ignoring this manifestation
of bank competition would surely make our approach into the competition-bank risk nexus
unreliable. The Boone indicator measured at the federal state level captures exactly this
characteristic of bank market competition.8
2.2 Methodology
Since our main dependent variable is a binary variable which indicates whether or not a
distress event has occurred, a natural starting point for our analysis is a binary response
model. To analyze the effect of bank competition on bank risk taking, we study binary
response models of the general form
P(yit = 1|xit-1) = G(xit-1)  p(xit-1) (5)
where P(·) is the probability that bank i at time t experiences a default event given the
set of observable covariates xit-1, with  being fixed parameters to be estimated. In order
to assure the exogeneity of the regressors xi and to introduce a forward-looking dimension
into the model, the explanatory variables are all lagged one period relative to the response
variable yi. The function G(·) is a link function mapping the linear index xit-1  to the
response probability with support in the open unit interval. For the majority of the empirical
analysis, we will use the logit model as a special case of the link function G(·). Hence, we
will estimate models of the form:
P(yit = 1|xit-1) = G(xit-1) =
exp(xit-1)
1+exp(xit-1)
. (6)
Model Specification
To determine the effect of the various measures of bank competition and concentration on
banks' probability of experiencing a distress event, we define the following baseline specifica-
tion written in the latent response representation
y
it
= +0 +1 +Control Variablesit-11 +Bank Competitionit-12 +uit. (7)
8It would, of course, be beneficial to estimate Boone indicators at the county level, too. This is, however,
impeded by the fact that for all but the largest counties the number of distinct banks per county-year is too
small to reliably estimate the Boone indicator.
10
The term uit is a continuously distributed variable independent of the regressors and dis-
tributed according to a standard logistic distribution. The population mean is given by ,
while 0 and 1 are stand-ins for full sets of banking group dummy variables and time dummy
variables. The main focus of the empirical analysis will be on the direction of the effect of
the different ways of approximating Bank Competitionit-1. Since the number of potential
bank-specific control variables Control Variablesit-1 to be included in the econometric
model is immense, we orient ourselves to the existing literature, which uses the so-called
CAMEL taxonomy (King et al. (2006)).

3 Results
In this section we present regression results from our empirical models. Hereby, we investigate
the competition-bank risk taking nexus on its own (including robustness with alternative risk
measures), we address potential endogeneity concerns of the Lerner Index, and we examine
the interactions of competition measures with monetary policy.
3.1 Bank Risk and Competition
Column one of Table 3 shows the results of the baseline logit regression. The model specifi-
cation closely follows the standard bank rating model used at the Bundesbank. This model
setup has performed reasonable well (see Kick & Koetter 2007 and Porath 2006). Although
not shown, all regressions include time-specific and banking group dummies for large banks
(i.e., big private), Landesbanks, central cooperative banks, savings banks, and small private
banks (the reference group being cooperative banks) as further controls. We first present
the results without including any measure of competition or concentration in order to see
whether the pure model produces reasonable results.
The results for the CAMEL covariates are in line with the existing literature. The ratio
of bank equity to total assets, and bank reserves to total assets are measures of the degree
of capitalization of banks. As expected, better-capitalized banks have a lower probability
of default (PD) relative to the sample mean. The dummy variable indicating the presence
of hidden liabilities as well as the dummy variable indicating that the bank has reduced its
reserves in the current reporting year have a positive and highly significant coefficient. The
German institutional framework allows banks to build up hidden liabilities in the balance
sheet instead of writing off problem loans. Hidden liabilities thus indicate the existence of
problem loans in the credit portfolio which, in turn, increases the overall riskiness of the bank
as indicated by the positive coefficient. The share of customer loans as well as the sectoral
concentration of the business loan portfolio both have a negative effect on the probability
of experiencing a distress event. We interpret both measures as indicators of the degree of
specialization of a bank. The finding that more specialized banks are on average less risky is in
line with the findings provided by Jahn & Kick (2011). The profitability of banks, measured
by return on equity, reduces the likelihood of a distress event, while the share of fee income
has a risk-increasing effect. The share of fee income is a measure of the engagement of a
bank in non-traditional banking activities. The income generated by non-traditional banking
activities is generally riskier and less stable compared to more traditional types of banking
business. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans is an ex post measure of realized
credit risk. As expected, higher non-performing loans increase PD. We also include the ratio
of off-balance sheet activities to total assets in our baseline specification. Off-balance sheet
items mainly comprise credit commitments, which may bear risks if numerous customers
draw simultaneously on these lines. Indeed, the positive and significant coefficient indicates
12
that higher off-balance sheet activities increase the the likelihood of a experiencing a distress
event.9
In columns two to four we add, one at a time, our indicators of the different dimensions
of market power and market concentration discussed in the previous section, while in column
five we add all the indicators simultaneously.
In column two we add to the baseline specification the Lerner Index which measures the
ability of each single bank to price its products above the marginal costs. The point estimate
of the Lerner Index has a negative and highly significant effect on the distress probability of
banks. Increasing the pricing power of banks (reducing competition) significantly reduces the
likelihood of a distress event. The risk-reducing effect of bank-level market power is thus in
line with the "competition fragility" or "franchise value" view of the competition-bank risk
taking nexus: more intense competition between banks reduces the charter value of banks
and thereby encourages banks to take more risk. This result thus supports the majority of
theoretical studies in the bank competition-stability trade-off literature that predict a risk-
increasing effect of competition (e.g. Keeley 1990, Matutes & Vives 2000, Hellmann, Murdock
& Stiglitz 2000, Allen & Gale 2004 and Wagner 2010).
We want to emphasize that the risk-reducing effect of bank-level pricing power is neither
driven by an efficiency story, nor by a business model or risk-level story. First, we inten-
tionally computed a Lerner Index which takes into account that banks often operate using
less-than-optimal production technology. The Lerner Index is, therefore, not biased by any
inefficiencies at the bank level. Second, our set of exogenous variables controls sufficiently
well for heterogeneity across banks arising from differences in the degree of specialization of
banks. To make this point concrete, if the degree of specialization (or generally the business
model) is not properly accounted for, it is possible that the Lerner Index will capture varia-
tion in the degree of specialization between banks. Banks specializing in providing loans to
a certain group of borrowers might be able to set loan rates at a markup which would result
in a higher Lerner Index. The variable sectoral concentration of credit portfolio controls for
this channel. Finally, we also control for a large array of different risk categories. While the
share of non-performing loans controls well for the ex-post realized risk in the balance sheet,
a reserve reduction and the presence of hidden liabilities control for possible assumed but not
yet fully realized risk. A similar argument applies to the off-balance sheet activities of banks:
a high level of off-balance sheet activity might indicate higher bank risk which is, however,
unobservable when exclusively relying on balance sheet information.
In column three we add the variable Regional Geographic Reach. This variable cor-
responds to a measure for a bank's market power at the regional level. Given that for the
overwhelming majority of banks in Germany the relevant banking market is the county the
bank is located in (either by law or size of the bank) this variable can therefore be interpreted
as direct market-specific indicators of competition. The positive and highly significant co-

efficient on the market share indicator supports the conclusion that a higher market share
of bank branches is positively related to bank instability in the regional market. The risk
increasing effect of a higher market share in the regional market stands in contrast to the
risk reducing effect of higher pricing power at the bank level measured using bank-specific
Lerner Indexes. One possible interpretation of this result is that banks with a large branching
network might be "too-big-to-fail" for this particular regions. Moral hazard issues associated
with the "too-big-to-fail" paradigm might lead those banks to pursue riskier projects. Indeed,
Dam & Koetter (2012) show that there exists a strong moral hazard behavior among German
banks which can be explained by political economy considerations at the regional level.
In column four we add the Boone Indicator of competition. In the way we have calculated
the Boone Indicator, it is a competition measure which varies across the 16 federal states
in Germany. The point estimate of the Boone Indicator variable is positive and highly
significant. Recall that the Boone indicator measures how harshly banks are punished in
terms of profits for being inefficient. Higher values of the Boone Indicator imply that a
specific market allows banks to generate relatively high profits (although being relatively
inefficient), thereby indicating that the market is characterized by a low degree of competitive
pressure. A positive coefficient of the Boone indicator thus implies that banks operating in
low-competition banking markets have a higher probability of experiencing a distress event.
This result is in line with Schaeck & Cihak (2010), who also find that increasing competition,
measured by the Boone Indicator, has a tendency to reduce risk taking at the bank level.
In the last column we add all four distinct measures of competition simultaneously into the
model. Since all of the competition indicators are meant to measure the degree of competition,
the question emerges as to whether they measure the same effects or whether each of these
variables has a direct and independent effect on bank risk-taking. Apparently they do all
have independent effects on bank risk: each of the three variables remains highly significant
and retains its original effect on bank risk-taking.
The result that higher competition, measured using the Boone Indicator, reduces bank
risk might seem to be at odds with the result that higher competition measured using a
bank-specific Lerner Index increases bank risk. However, both indicators are measuring very
different dimensions of bank competition. On the one hand, the (in-)efficiency adjusted
Lerner Index captures reasonably well the possibility of banks to generate profits purely by
extracting monopoly rents. The Boone Indicator, on the other hand, indicates how strongly
the market punishes banks for inefficiencies. This gives rise to a different channel through
which competition affects the probability of default: more competitive banking markets, as
indicated by lower values of the Boone Indicator, are dominated by more efficient banks as
competition drives out the less efficient banks (see also Schaeck & Cihak 2010 and Turk Ariss
2010 for empirical evidence that bank competition increases efficiency in banking). There
exist theoretical arguments as well as empirical evidence that more efficient banks are less
risky. First, Petersen & Rajan (1995) argue that more efficient banks have better screening
and monitoring abilities. At the empirical front, Berger & DeYoung (1997) show that more

efficient banks have lower non-performing loans ratio. Taken together with our finding that
the Boone Indicator has a negative effect on bank risk taking suggests that competition
has a stability enhancing effect via an improvement in bank efficiency, and more specifically
by improving banks' monitoring and screening procedures (see Schaeck & Cihak 2010 for a
similar argument).
Viewed from a more theoretical angle, the result that higher pricing power reduces bank
risk taking supports the idea that higher franchise values mitigate the risk-shifting incentives
of banks, thus contributing to a more stable banking system. Simultaneously, higher bank
competition reduces risk-shifting incentives at the borrower level by forcing banks to develop
more efficient screening and monitoring mechanisms.
15
Robustness with Bank Default and Alternative Risk Measures
Table 4 contains robustness checks of our results against changing the bank distress to a bank
default measure. As explained in greater detail in Section 2, a distress event consists of either
a direct capital injection into the bank, a distressed merger event, or a moratorium. Since the
distressed merger and moratoria events are the strongest default events in our dataset, we
check whether the effect of competition and concentration on the distress probability changes
with the severity of the distress event. One might argue, for instance, that it is especially the
most risky banks which benefit from an increase in their pricing power.
Column one is just a replication of the results of the full benchmark model from Table 3
which we present here for the convenience of the reader. The results presented in column two,
however, indicate that increasing the bank-level pricing power - that is, increasing the Lerner
Index - no longer has a risk-reducing effect when concentrating on the probability of a distress
merger or a moratorium (i.e., focusing the analysis on actual bank defaults). The same holds
for the Boone Indicator. While more competitive behavior in the (more broadly defined)
banking market, i.e. a lower Boone Indicator, has a risk-alleviating effect in the benchmark
regression, the Boone Indicator has no significant effect on the default probability of banks.
In this regression, the sign of the variable Regional Geographical Reach changes, too,
indicating that a higher market share of bank branches reduced the probability of a bank
default (even when it does positively affect weaker forms of bank distress, as shown in the
baseline regressions in Table 3).
In column three we present regression results using the z-score as the dependent variable.
The z-score is a widely used variable in the empirical banking literature to approximate the
overall level of banks. The success of the z-score can mostly be attributed to the fact that
it can be easily calculated from banks' balance sheet information. Although we think that
using actual distress events is more appropriate when trying to study the competition-risk
nexus, we present, for reasons of comparability with the existing literature, the results for
the z-score model in the third column of Table 4.10 In general, the results from the z-score
fixed-effects OLS regressions are qualitatively similar to those of the logit model. Note that,
since the z-score increases with the soundness of banks, a positive coefficient indicates a risk-
reducing effect - in contrast to the logit model where a negative coefficient indicates lower
risk. A few differences are worth noting: First, neither the level of reserves nor the dummy
for hidden liabilities exerts a significant effect on risk. The insignificance of bank reserves and
the hidden liabilities dummy is very counterintuitive given the importance of these variable
10The z-score is calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital and operating profits of bank i to the standard
deviation of operating profits where each position is measured relative to risk weighted total assets. To take
into account that capital and total asset positions are end-of-year figures while profits are within-year flows,
Tier 1 capital and total assets are averaged over two years (i.e., we calculate "mid-point values"). To account
for changes in the volatility of profits over time, the standard deviation of operating profits is calculated over
a window of three years. Taking the natural logarithm of the z-score ensures that results are not driven by
extreme values.
16
in the German banking landscape. However, given the drawbacks of the z-score, we do not
give too much weight to these results.
Finally, the last column in Table 4 contains the results from a model which specifies
the non-performing loans ratio as dependent variable. The non-performing loans ratio is
the single most important determinant of a bank's credit risk. The results of this model
show that higher market power at the bank level reduces bank risk-taking via the credit
portfolio, that is, banks with a higher Lerner Index seem to choose to finance safer projects.
At the same time, and mirror imaging the previous results, competition measured by the
Boone Indicator suggests that lower competition increases credit risk-taking of banks. The
coefficient of our competition measure related to the banks' home county has a negative sign,
indicating that banks with more market power in the relevant banking market take out safer
loans. This is in contrast to the results from the broad distress measure but might help
reconcile the finding that banks with higher regional market power have a lower probability
of outright bank failure. However, the coefficient of the variable Regional Geographic
Reach is not significantly different zero. One possible reason for this finding might be
neglected endogeneity of the Lerner Index with respect to the risk measures used, an issue
which we address next.

Estimation Methods and Endogeneity Issues
A valid concern to the results presented so far is the potential endogeneity of the Lerner
Index. Schaeck & Cihak (2010), for instance, argue that the level of bank risk might also
affect the competitive conduct of banks. Banks facing a high probability of default, in an
attempt to "gamble for resurrection", might try to attract new businesses by aggressively
pricing its products, ultimately affecting measures of bank competition such as the Lerner
Index. One might argue that our modeling approach mitigates endogeneity issues by including
18
the explanatory variables with a lag of one period. However, endogeneity between bank risk
and bank competition might still be an issue if bank managers form expectations about
their default probability and anticipate future distress events. Our strategy to deal with
the endogeneity of the Lerner Index is to instrument the Lerner Index with appropriate
instrumental variables.
Following Koetter, Kolari & Spierdijk (forthcoming) and motivated by the dynamic panel
literature (e.g. Blundell & Bond 1998), our first instrumental variable consists of the lagged
values of the Lerner Index. The second set of instruments consists of the bank's home
counties' ability to bear debt (debt sustainability). The idea behind this instrument is that
German counties rely heavily on (local) banks to cover their (short term) financing need,
with savings banks and Landesbanken having a predominant position in this market. We
reckon that banks located in more indebted counties have different opportunities to exert
pricing power against the public sector. On the other hand, given that German counties
cannot default, there should not be a direct relation between the relative indebtedness of
counties and the probability of default at the bank level. Our final two sets of instruments
consist of the share of bank employees relative to the overall credit portfolio and of the
Herfindahl-Hischmann-Index (HHI) of bank branches at the regional level.11
We present the results from our Instrumental Variables (IV) approach in Table 5. We
use both, a two-step IV-probit approach (column (1) and column (3)) and an IV linear
probability model (column(2) and column(4)). The first two columns correspond to the
model using the broader distress definition as dependent variable (Bank Distress) while
the third and the fourth column use the distress definition taking into account only outright
bank failures (Bank Default). We also estimated our benchmark regressions using simple
linear probability models and probit models (results not shown): the results from these
robustness checks, available upon request, leave the main message of the previous results
unaltered. For completeness we also present the results of the IV regressions of the models
using the z-score and the non-performing loans ratio as dependent variables.
The results of IV-probit regression using the broader distress measure (column (1)) tell the
same story as the simple logit approach of the previous sections: Increasing bank-level pricing
power reduces the probability of experiencing a distress event, providing further support for
the competition-fragility hypothesis. Simultaneously, more concentrated banking markets
are, ceteris paribus, characterized by riskier banks. Finally, banks located in states with
a lower competitive conduct, i.e. higher values for the Boone Indicator, have also higher
distress probabilities. Results are slightly different when applying the IV-linear probability
model. The Lerner Index and the Boone Indicator enter significantly and have their familiar
signs (negative and positive, respectively). In contrast, the variable measuring the market
11Clearly, the HHI index is conceptually similar to the variable Regional Geographic Reach. We therefore
tested the validity of including the HHI in the set of excluded instruments, besides the more formal test
presented below, by including the HHI directly into our benchmark regression. The results support our choice
since the HHI never entered the model with a significant coefficient.
19
contestability/concentration, although still positive, looses its significant effect. Concerning
the results of the IV-regressions employing the narrowly defined distress indicator (column
(3) and column (4)), we again find that all our previous results remain valid when applying
an IV-probit approach (column(3)). The same hold for the IV-linear probability model,
except that the Lerner index remains significant (column(4)). Column (5) and column (6)
present the results from IV regressions when using as dependent variable the z-score and
the non-performing loans ratio, respectively. Again, the findings of the previous sections are
confirmed. Furthermore, the negative coefficient of the Regional Geographic Reach is now
significant at the 10% level.
The lower part of Table 5 presents formal tests on the validity of our IV setup. Note that
we only present results for the test statistics based on the linear probability model simply
because these test are not properly defined in a (non-linear) probit framework. The first
test statistic correspond to the relevance of the instruments, that is whether the instrument
variables are sufficiently correlated with the bank lending rate. We report the Wald F-
statistic based on the Kleinbergen-Paap rk statistic. The results show that the F-statistic is
well above the commonly used critical value of 10 in all model setups. A F-statistic well above
10 is generally viewed as indication that instrument weakness is not a major problem.12 The
Hansen J-test concerns the validity of the instruments; that is, whether they are uncorrelated
with the error term of the main equation. The null hypothesis is that the instruments can
be excluded from the main equation. The result indicates that we can not reject the null
hypothesis in neither one of the regressions but in the regression when using the narrowly
defined distress measure as dependent variable. However, it is also this regression model
where the test on the exogeneity of the Lerner Index cannot be rejected, suggesting that
the Lerner Index can be treated as exogenous to outright bank failures. For all other risk
measures the test on the exogeneity of the Lerner Index is rejected.
12Note that the values of the Kleinbergen-Paap statistic are identical in both IV linear probability models
simply because in both models the first stage regressions are identical.

Table 5: Sensitivity to Estimation Method and Endogeneity Issues
This table shows regression results from IV-probit models and IV-linear-probability-models (IV-LPM): a two-step
IV-probit approach is shown in (column (1) and column (3)) and an IV-LPM in (column (2) and column (4)). The
first two columns correspond to the model using the broader distress definition as dependent variable (Bank Distress)
while the third and the fourth column use the distress definition taking into account only outright bank failures (Bank
Default). Column (5) and column (6) reports results from IV regressions with the z-score and non-performing loans
to total loans (NPL) as dependent variable, respectively. In the instrumental variables regression we instrument the
Lerner Index using the lagged Lerner Index, a bank's home counties' debt sustainability, the share of bank employees
relative to the overall credit portfolio and the Herfindahl-Hischmann-Index (HHI) of bank branches at the regional
level (see the main text for a detailed discussion). *, **, *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, 1% level

3.2 Bank Risk, Competition and Monetary Policy
In this section we investigate how monetary policy shocks interact with the competition-bank
risk nexus. A growing empirical literature on the risk-taking channel of monetary policy
has shown that heterogeneity in the balance sheet health of banks is an important factor
determining the strength of the transmission of monetary policy to bank risk. Specifically,
low capitalized and low liquid banks seem to react strongest to monetary policy shocks. The
role of banks' market power in shaping the response of banks to monetary policy shocks in
terms of bank risk is however largely unexplored. Table 6 show regression results tackling
this issue.
In column (1) in Table 6 we show the results from our benchmark specification estimated
using a linear probability model in which we replace the time dummies with four key macroe-
conomic variables (the first differences of the short term interest rate (IR), real GDP
(GDP), the consumer price index (P) as well as the level of the long rate/short rate
spread).13 The results in column (1) show that loose monetary policy reduces the probabil-
ity of experiencing a distress event. This finding is line De Graeve, Kick & Koetter (2008)
and suggests that expansionary monetary policy improves the financial/economic conditions
of banks existing borrower. This in turn translates into a lower overall probability of bank
distress. Note that this finding is not necessarily inconsistent with the risk taking channel of
monetary policy. Our data does not allow to distinguish banks new business activity from
its outstanding investments. Hence, it is possible that banks shift their new investment into
riskier segments. Instead, our result show that expansionary monetary policy lowers banks'
overall distress probability. In this sense, the risk reducing effect of monetary policy on the
outstanding business of banks seems to outweigh potential negative effects on banks new
activities; see Buch, Eickmeier & Prieto (forthcoming) for a similar finding and discussion.
To investigate the effect of changes in monetary conditions on bank risk through bank
competition and market power we add in column (2) to (7), one at a time, the interaction of
the change in the short term interest rate with the different competition measures. Column
(2) and column (3) show that the positive effect of a higher short term interest rate on banks
distress probability is weakened by higher market power as measured by the Lerner index.
Hence, this finding suggest that banks competitive position is an important feature in the
transmission of monetary policy changes to bank risk. Furthermore, our results are consistent
with the theoretical hypothesis of Dell'Ariccia, Marquez & Laeven (2010) that banks with
more market power change the risk profile of their balance sheet less following a change a
monetary policy. Conversely, as shown in column (6) and column (7) the Boone indicator
suggests that banks located in markets with less competitive pressure react stronger to interest
rate changes. A tentative interpretation of this finding is that a low competitive pressure, as
indicated by a higher Boone indicator, also reflects a low degree of market discipline in these

interaction effects in non-linear regression models such as logit models.

banking markets, in the sense of allowing banks to engage in riskier projects without being
punished by customers.
We performed a number of robustness analysis related to Table 6. First, to make sure
that the change in the short term interest rate is a reasonable good indicator for monetary
policy shocks, we re-estimated the model using a Taylor rule residual as alternative indicator
for monetary policy shocks. The results are very similar. We therefore decided to report only
the results using the change in the short term interest rate because it is the simpler measure.
Furthermore, we also interacted the competition measures with the long-short spread and,
to control for potential correlation of the competition measures with other bank specific
controls, we also included (alongside the competition-interest rate interactions) interaction of
the monetary policy indicator with the equity ratio and bank reserves. The results from these
robustness checks, which are available on request, do not materially alter the main results
presented above.

4 Conclusion
The developments in the banking market leading to the financial crisis in 2008 have once
again heightened interest in the determinants of bank risk. An increasingly competitive envi-
ronment caused by the growing internationalization of financial markets and the emergence
of non-bank players in the market for corporate financing has often been seen as contribut-
ing to increasing banks' incentives to take risks. This perception of the effects of higher
competition on bank risk is confirmed by a large array of theoretical and empirical banking
models. Using unique regulatory data available from the Bundesbank we revisit the bank
competition-stability nexus.
We improve on the existing literature along three crucial dimensions. First, in contrast
to other bank-level studies, we use the most direct measure of bank risk available. Our
measurement of bank-level risk is generated from the distress database collected by the Bun-
desbank. This dataset contains information on bank distress and bank default events (i.e.,
distressed bank mergers and bank moratoria). Hence, our measurement of bank risk directly
captures the possibility of a bank defaulting. We concur with Aspachs, Goodhart, Tsomo-
cos & Zicchino (2007), who correctly state that the probability of bank default is the most
appealing bank risk statistic because, by considering all types of risks, it provides a more
exhaustive picture of risk borne by the banking system.
Second, the richness of our dataset allows us to control for a wide array of different
time-varying characteristics of banks which are likely to influence the competition-risk taking
channel. We control for a number of different dimensions of risk at the bank level while de-
termining the effect of competition on the probability of default. Besides measures of realized
risk, we also have at our disposal measures of potential risks assumed by banks which have,
however, not yet materialized. Furthermore, our dataset contains detailed information on
the business model of banks. Ignoring the time-varying heterogeneity induced by differences
in business model might distort the assessment of the risk taking-competition relationship.
Finally, in an approach to take existing empirical evidence seriously, we allow competition
to affect the probability of default along four different dimensions. We include different
measures of competition, contestability and concentration, each corresponding to a different
contextual level of a bank's competitive environment.
The main messages which emerge from our empirical analysis can be summarized as fol-
lows. An increase in the market power of banks at the level of the individual institution,
measured via (in)efficiency-adjusted Lerner Indexes, tends to reduce the probability of de-
fault of that bank. This result is thus consistent with the majority of theoretical contributions
showing that a reduction in the pricing power of individual banks due to fiercer competition
leads to increasing bank risk. In contrast, our competition measures applying to the level of
the bank market (i.e., measuring competition via geographical reach and the Boone Indica-
tor at the county and federal state level) tend to indicate that a more competitive market
25
environment goes hand in hand with a lower level of bank risk. Thus, when looking upon
competition as altering the working mechanism at the (relevant) market level (which must not
necessarily be a one-to-one mapping to the ability of banks to price products over marginal
costs), our evidence supports the recent theoretical and empirical contributions stressing the
transmission channels which lead to a risk-reducing effect of higher bank competition.
Investigating the competition-bank risk taking nexus we confirm that loose monetary pol-
icy improves the financial/economic conditions of a bank's existing borrower which translates
into a lower overall probability of bank distress. Building on these results we find that a higher
degree of market power measured by the Lerner index reduces the effect of monetary policy
on bank risk which is consistent with the idea that bank with more market power are more
reluctant changing the risk profile of their balance sheet following a change a monetary policy
(simply because their can already extract large rents). Conversely, the Bonne indicator sug-
gests that banks located in markets with less competitive pressure react stronger to interest
rate changes.
From a policy perspective, our results indicate that competition-reducing regulation (e.g.,
artificial entry barriers) does not necessarily enhance the stability of individual banks. In-
stead, our results show that the degree of competition affects bank risk in a manifold number
of ways, some of them with stability-enhancing effects, but others apparently without such
effects.
