Abstract
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating type of stroke characterized by bleeding into the brain parenchyma and
secondary brain injury resulting from strong neuroinflammatory responses to blood components. Production of prostaglan-
din E2
(PGE2
) is significantly upregulated following ICH and contributes to this inflammatory response in part through its E
prostanoid receptor subtype 2 (EP2). Signaling through the EP2 receptor has been shown to affect outcomes of many acute
and chronic neurological disorders; although, not yet explored in the context of ICH. Wildtype (WT) and EP2 receptor
knockout (EP2À/À) mice were subjected to ICH, and various anatomical and functional outcomes were assessed by histology
and neurobehavioral testing, respectively. When compared with age-matched WT controls, EP2À/À mice had 41.9 Æ 4.7%
smaller ICH-induced brain lesions and displayed significantly less ipsilateral hemispheric enlargement and incidence of
intraventricular hemorrhage. Anatomical outcomes correlated with improved functional recovery as identified by neuro-
logical deficit scoring. Histological staining was performed to begin investigating the mechanisms involved in EP2-mediated
neurotoxicity after ICH. EP2À/À mice exhibited 45.5 Æ 5.8% and 41.4 Æ 8.1% less blood and ferric iron accumulation, respect-
ively. Furthermore, significantly less striatal and cortical microgliosis, striatal and cortical astrogliosis, blood­brain barrier
breakdown, and peripheral neutrophil infiltration were seen in EP2À/À mice. This study is the first to suggest a deleterious
role for the PGE2
-EP2 signaling axis in modulating brain injury, inflammation, and functional recovery following ICH. Targeting
the EP2 G protein-coupled receptor may represent a new therapeutic avenue for the treatment of hemorrhagic stroke.

Introduction
Among the various types of stroke, intracerebral hemor-
rhage (ICH) is one of the most disabling and has the
highest mortality rates (van Asch et al., 2010; Gonzalez-
Perez et al., 2013). Further, there are currently no effect-
ive therapies for the treatment of ICH, and the clinical
management of patients focuses on supportive measures
as surgical and medical management approaches have
failed to improve outcomes (Sahni and Weinberger,
2007; Mayer et al., 2008; Rincon and Mayer, 2008;
Crandall et al., 2011). Primary injury after ICH results
from the influx of blood into the brain parenchyma lead-
ing to mass effects, increased local pressure, and
disruption of brain architecture (Aronowski and Zhao,
2011; Mendez et al., 2013). Secondary damage is a
chronic process attributable to the cytotoxicity and
resulting strong inflammatory responses initiated by the

presence of blood components and is the likely culprit of
pervasive, and often irreversible, neurological deficits
(Chen and Regan, 2007; Wang and Dore
´ , 2007b;
Aronowski and Zhao, 2011). Understanding the path-
ways involved during these secondary processes may pro-
vide additional insight into ICH pathophysiology and
uncover new therapeutic targets.
Neuroinflammatory insults lead to increased produc-
tion of prostaglandin E2
(PGE2
), a potent biolipid mes-
senger that plays an important role in many physiological
and pathological conditions in the brain (Jiang and
Dingledine, 2013; Johansson et al., 2013). PGE2
levels
are increased in response to inflammation by cyclooxy-
genase-2 (COX-2), the inducible form of cyclooxygenase,
and a rate-limiting enzyme responsible for formation of
prostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic acid
(Candelario-Jalil et al., 2005; Ahmad et al., 2006b). PGE2
has many diverse actions, with toxic and neuroprotective
effects, as a result of differential activation of mainly four
E prostanoid (EP) receptors, EP1-4 (Manabe et al., 2004;
Pooler et al., 2004; Echeverria et al., 2005; Ahmad et al.,
2010; Jiang et al., 2013). Adding to the complexity, each
of these receptors has their own distinct signaling path-
ways, tissue distribution, and expression profiles
(Candelario-Jalil et al., 2005; Johansson et al., 2013).
Here, we focus on the role of the EP receptor subtype 2
(EP2), a G protein-coupled receptor that stimulates ade-
nylyl cyclase leading to increases in cytosolic cyclic AMP
(cAMP), which in turn engages protein kinase A (PKA)
and the exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac). and
Epac signaling are intimately connected and may result in
synergistic or opposite effects (Bos, 2006). The temporal
gradient of cAMP levels likely determines which pathway
is preferentially activated: with early EP2 activation, and
thus low cAMP, the PKA pathway presumably predom-
inates, given its higher affinity for cAMP, while the Epac
pathway may succeed with continued EP2 activation and
rises in cytosolic cAMP (Jiang and Dingledine, 2013). In
the brain, PGE2
-EP2-cAMP-mediated PKA and Epac
activation is generally associated with neuroprotective
and neurotoxic effects, respectively (McCullough et al.,
2004; Suzuki et al., 2010; Hara et al., 2012; Mohan
et al., 2015).
Using in vitro and in vivo models and genetic and
pharmacologic approaches, the role of the EP2 receptor
in mediating outcomes of various neurological conditions
has been extensively studied. We, and others, have
shown the beneficial effects of EP2 receptor signaling
following transient ischemic stroke, permanent focal
ischemia, and N-Methyl-D-aspartate-induced excitotoxi-
city (McCullough et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2005; Ahmad
et al., 2006b; Ahmad et al., 2010). In contrast, EP2 recep-
tor signaling resulted in worse outcomes, with more oxi-
dative stress and inflammation, in mouse models of
Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD),
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and epilepsy (Liang
et al., 2005; Jin et al., 2007; Liang et al., 2008; Jiang et al.,
2012, 2013). All of these conditions have a considerable
inflammatory component and collectively these studies
suggest that EP2 receptor signaling can have either posi-
tive or negative immunomodulatory effects depending on
the underlying neuropathological process.
Given the importance of PGE2
-EP2 receptor signaling
in a wide range of acute and chronic neurological condi-
tions, we sought to determine the respective and unique
contribution of EP2 in modulating ICH-induced brain
injury and inflammation. We found that genetic deletion
of the EP2 receptor results in improved anatomical and
functional recovery following ICH and is associated with
less blood and ferric iron accumulation, neuroinflamma-
tion, blood­brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, and periph-
eral neutrophil infiltration. The PGE2
EP2 receptor
appears to play an important role in modulating ICH-
induced brain injury and inflammation and could repre-
sent a new therapeutic target for the treatment of this
condition, which currently has no effective therapies.
Materials and Methods
Mice
Studies were performed on 2.5- to 5-month-old male
wildtype (WT, 3.2 Æ 0.8 months, n ¼ 8) and EP2 receptor
knockout (EP2À/À, 4.5 Æ 0.5 months, n ¼ 12) C57BL/6
mice. The EP2À/À mice develop normally, gain weight
at a rate equal to that of WT animals, and have no
gross anatomical or behavioral abnormalities when com-
pared with WT littermates (Hizaki et al., 1999; Ahmad
et al., 2006b). Prior to experiments, the genotype of
EP2À/À mice was confirmed by polymerase chain reac-
tion. Colonies were maintained in our animal facilities
in a temperature-controlled environment (23 Æ 2C) on
a 12 hr reverse dark/light cycle, so behavioral testing
could be performed during the awaken phase. Mice
were allowed ad libitum access to food and water
before and after surgical procedures. The Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of
Florida approved all animal protocols.
ICH Model
ICH was induced in WT and EP2À/À mice as described
previously with modifications (Chen et al., 2011; Singh
et al., 2013). Additional changes were incorporated in
order to avoid needle insertion through the motor
cortex and thus the possibility of confounding results
on behavioral analyses and to improve the modeling of
clinical deep basal ganglia hemorrhages, where concomi-
tant intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is seen in 40% of
nontraumatic ICH cases and is associated with poor
2 ASN Neuro
long-term prognosis (Moradiya et al., 2014; Poon et al.,
2014). Changes were accomplished by modifying the site
and angle of craniotomy/needle insertion and the site of
injection within the striatum. Briefly, stereotactic equip-
ment was first manipulated so the injection could be per-
formed into the left hemisphere at a 40 angle from the
vertical plane. Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane
(4% induction, 1.5­2% maintenance) and immobilized
on a stereotactic frame (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL).
A small left-sided incision in the skin overlying the skull
was made in a coronal plane midway between the left eye
and ear. A craniotomy was performed at an angle match-
ing that of the stereotactic angle at the following coord-
inates: 0.0 mm anteroposterior and 3.8 mm left, relative to
bregma. A syringe with a 26-gauge needle (Hamilton Co.,
Reno, NV) was inserted 3.6 mm ventral from the skull
surface and 0.04 units of collagenase type VII-S (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO) dissolved in 0.40 ml of sterile water was
infused at 0.20 ml/min using an automated injector
(Stoelting). The needle was left in place for 5 min and
then slowly removed over a 15 min period. Rectal tem-
peratures were maintained at 37.0 Æ 0.5C throughout all
surgical procedures and mice were allowed to fully
recover in temperature and humidity-controlled cham-
bers postoperatively.
Determination of Initial Hemorrhage Volume
As different initial hemorrhage volumes in WT and
EP2À/À mice after collagenase-induced ICH could influ-
ence anatomical and functional recovery, we assessed
brain hemoglobin content in both groups 5 hr as we
have described (Wang and Dore
´ , 2007a). Briefly, WT
(n ¼ 3) and EP2À/À (n ¼ 4) mice were deeply anesthetized
and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). After quick removal of the brain, the olfac-
tory bulbs and cerebellum were discarded and the ipsilat-
eral and contralateral hemispheres were separately
snap frozen in 2-methylbutane precooled over dry ice.
Samples were thawed and homogenized for 5 min
in 700 ml of sterile deionized water. After centrifugation
at 14,000 rpm and 4C for 30 min, the supernatant
was used for hemoglobin determination by Drabkin's
method (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). An eight-point stand-
ard curve was generated by spiking 15 ml of lysed cit-
rate anticoagulated blood, collected by intracardial
puncture from control animals, into 135 ml of a pooled
contralateral hemisphere supernatant with twofold
dilutions thereafter. In a 96-well plate, 50 ml of
Drabkin's reagent was added to 50 ml of supernatant.
All samples were run in triplicate. After 15 min incuba-
tion at room temperature, cyanmethemoglobin concen-
tration, reflecting brain hemoglobin content and thus
initial hemorrhage volume, was determined by absorb-
ance at 540 nm.
Functional Outcomes
Functional outcomes were assessed daily post-ICH by
neurological deficit scoring (NDS), accelerating rotarod
performance, and open field locomotor activity. Testing
was performed during the dark cycle (awaken phase) by
investigators blinded to genotype. Each test was per-
formed at the same time of the day and mice were allowed
1 hr of rest in between tests. NDS: two blinded investiga-
tors independently assessed mice for deficits in neuro-
logical functioning as we have described (Glushakov
et al., 2013). Accelerating rotarod performance: mice
were evaluated for motor deficits and coordination,
endurance, and balance using an accelerating rotarod
Rotamex-5 machine and software (Columbus, OH).
Rotational speed started at 4 rpm and ended at 30 rpm,
and the latency to fall was automatically collected by the
software. On the three consecutive days prior to surgery,
mice were trained twice per day (morning and late after-
noon), with three cycles per training period. Average per-
formance on the sixth training period served as baseline
functioning. Post-ICH testing consisted of one testing
period per day with three cycles and data are reported
as the average latency to fall. Open field locomotor activ-
ity: ambulatory distance and stereotypic time were mea-
sured using an automated open field activity monitor and
video tracking interface system (MED associates, St.
Albans, VT). Baseline locomotor activity was assessed
the day prior to surgery, before rotarod training and pre-
testing. Briefly, mice were placed individually in four
transparent acrylic cages and their locomotor activity
was recorded over a 30-min test period. The first 5 min
of recorded data was omitted to exclude for initial anxiety
responses.
Histology
At 72 hr post-ICH, mice were deeply anesthetized and
transcardially perfused with PBS (pH 7.4) followed by
4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were collected and
kept in 4% PFA for at least 24 hr prior to cryopreservation
in a 30% sucrose/PBS solution. Ten sets of 16 sections
equally distributed throughout the entire hematoma and
anteroposterior brain regions were processed at 30 mm and
stored at À80C for later histological procedures. In this
way, for each animal, multiple staining procedures can be
performed and the staining pattern throughout the whole
brain can be analyzed. Cresyl Violet staining was used to
assess lesion volume, ipsilateral hemispheric enlargement,
blood accumulation, and the incidence of IVH (Ahmad
et al., 2006a). To estimate the ferric iron content, Perls'
iron stain was completed by incubating slides in a 1:1 mix
of 2% hydrochloric acid and 2% potassium ferrocyanide
for 20 min, followed by counterstaining with nuclear fast
red. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate
microgliosis, astrogliosis, BBB breakdown, and

neutrophil infiltration using the following primary antibo-
dies: ionized calcium-binding adapter protein 1 (Iba1),
1:1,000 (Wako, Richmond, VA); glial fibrillary acidic pro-
tein (GFAP), 1:1,000 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA); immuno-
globulin G (IgG), 1:300 (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA); and myeloperoxidase (MPO), 1:500
(Pierce, Dallas, TX), respectively. A secondary biotiny-
lated antibody was used for detection (Vector
Laboratories), except for in the case of IgG staining,
which used a biotinylated primary anti-mouse IgG anti-
body. The Vectastain Elite Avidin/biotinylated enzyme
complex and 3,30-diaminobenzidine (DAB) kits (Vector
Laboratories) were used per manufacturer's instructions
for the avidin-peroxidase step and final DAB reaction,
respectively. MPO and IgG slides were counterstained
with Cresyl Violet, while GFAP and Iba1 slides were not
counterstained. After Cresyl violet, Perls' iron, and immu-
nohistochemistry, slides were dehydrated in increasing
concentrations of ethanol and coverslipped with
Permount.
Quantification Procedures
All slides were scanned using a ScanScope CS and ana-
lyzed with ImageScope software (Aperio Technologies,
Inc., Vista, CA). For quantification procedures in which
total brain pathology was analyzed (lesion volume, ipsi-
lateral hemispheric enlargement, blood accumulation,
ferric iron content, BBB breakdown, and peripheral neu-
trophil infiltration), all 16 sections were quantified for each
animal. To assess astrogliosis and microgliosis, the same
four sections representing maximal lesion area for each
animal were analyzed. Lesion volume: injured brain
regions were outlined, areas abstracted from the
ImageScope software, and a volume was calculated using
these areas, known distance between each section, and sec-
tion thickness. Percentage of ipsilateral hemispheric
enlargement: the whole brain and contralateral hemi-
sphere were outlined, volumes determined as described
above, and the percentage of ipsilateral hemispheric
enlargement was calculated by 100 Â [(ipsilateral-contral-
ateral)/contralateral]. IVH: the visual presence of red
blood cells (RBCs) within the lateral ventricles was
counted as IVH. Ferric iron content and immunohisto-
chemical stains: the ImageScope Positive Pixel Count soft-
ware was used for quantification after the appropriate
brain regions were outlined (see below). Algorithms were
developed for each of the stains such that the appropriate
signal and strength of signal were evaluated (e.g. blue
pixels in Perls' stained slides). These algorithms were
tuned so moderate and strongly positive pixels were
detected and weakly positive pixels were excluded as
these could potentially represent nonspecific signal.
Cortical microgliosis was analyzed by placing identically
sized boxes of 1,000 by 1,000 pixels in the ipsilateral and
contralateral motor cortex. Data are presented as the rela-
tive ipsilateral to contralateral signal. Striatal microgliosis
was analyzed by outlining of the ipsilateral and contralat-
eral striatum, excluding the lesion area. Data are presented
as the ipsilateral signal per area quantified, with normal-
ization for the contralateral signal per area quantified.
Cortical astrogliosis and striatal astrogliosis were analyzed
in a similar manner to microgliosis; however, these data
were not normalized for the contralateral equivalent due
to negligible signal in the contralateral cortex and striatum
with the thresholds used here. Blood accumulation, ferric
iron content, and MPO slides were analyzed by circling of
the ipsilateral hemisphere. Whole brain signal was exam-
ined for IgG quantification as staining extended into the
contralateral side in some cases. After all analyses, the
appropriate algorithm was run and signal data were
abstracted from the ImageScope software. As total ferric
iron content, BBB breakdown, and neutrophil infiltration
were analyzed, the values for each animal were individu-
ally corrected for lesion volume such that corrected and
uncorrected data are presented.
Statistics
GraphPad Prism 6 software was used for all statistical
analyses. Differences between two groups were deter-
mined by an unpaired two-tailed parametric Student's t-
test. The incidence rate for IVH was compared using
Fisher's exact test. Behavioral data were analyzed using
a repeated measures two-way analysis of variance and
Newman­Keuls multiple comparisons test. Data are
expressed as mean Æ SEM and p < .05 was considered
statistically significant in all analyses.
Results
Following induction of ICH in WT and EP2À/À
mice, consistent striatal hemorrhages were seen in
both groups at 72 hr postictus and various anatomical and
functional outcomes were evaluated by histology and
neurobehavioral testing, respectively. There were no sig-
nificant differences in percent body weight loss at any
time point post-ICH between the groups. The mortality
rates were 12.5% (1 out of 8) and 8.3% (1 out of 12) for
the WT and EP2À/À mice, respectively.
EP2 Receptor Deletion Reduces Brain Injury
After ICH
When compared with WT controls, EP2À/À mice dis-
played significantly reduced striatal lesions associated
with less blood accumulation and ipsilateral hemispheric
enlargement (Figure 1(a)). Quantification of lesion volume
showed that EP2À/À mice had 41.9 Æ 4.7% smaller lesions
when compared with WT controls (10.4Æ 0.8mm3
4 ASN Neuro
vs. 17.8Æ 2.0mm3, p¼ .0015, Figure 1(b)). As identified by
red/brown positive pixel count, the EP2À/À mice had
45.5 Æ 5.8% less blood accumulation (3.1 Æ 0.3
Â 107 A.U. vs. 5.7Æ 0.8Â 107A.U., p¼ .0032, Figure 1(c)).
EP2À/À mice also displayed 47.4 Æ 6.3% less percent ipsi-
lateral hemispheric enlargement (7.1 Æ 0.9% vs.
13.5 Æ 2.4%, p ¼ .0111, Figure 1(d)). IVH occurred in
53% of the mice, although EP2À/À mice had a significantly
decreased incidence of IVH when compared with WT con-
trols (20% vs. 100%, p ¼ .0023). The presence of IVH was
associated with an enlargement of the lateral ventricles
(Figure 1(a)).
EP2 Receptor Deletion Has No Effect on
Collagenase-Induced Bleeding
Initial brain hemoglobin levels were measured at 5 hr
post-surgery to determine if the improved outcomes in
EP2À/À mice resulted from differences in collagenase-
induced bleeding between the genotypes. Brain hemoglo-
bin content was not significantly different between WT
and EP2À/À mice (EP2À/À: 0.092 Æ 0.010 A.U., WT:
0.102 Æ 0.011 A.U., p ¼ .5142), indicating no differences
in susceptibility to collagenase-induced bleeding and ini-
tial hemorrhage volume.
Effect of EP2 Receptor Deletion on Functional
Outcomes After ICH
Functional outcomes were assessed by several neurobe-
havioral tests performed by investigators blinded to geno-
type at 24, 48, and 72 hr after ICH. For all tests, including
NDS, accelerating rotarod performance, and open field
locomotor activity, we did not find significant differences
between the WT and EP2À/À groups at any time point
post-ICH. WT and EP2À/À mice performed similarly on

baseline testing for rotarod and open field locomotor
activity. At 24, 48, and 72 hr after ICH, both groups per-
formed worse on the rotarod and had reduced ambula-
tory and stereotypic time when compared with baseline
function (p < .0001). EP2À/À mice had less neurologic def-
icits at 48 and 72 hr after ICH, when compared to 24 hr
(p < .05 for both time points), whereas no such improve-
ment was seen in the WT group (Figure 2(a)). Similarly,
the EP2À/À mice performed better on the rotarod at 72 hr
after ICH, when compared to 24 hr (p < .05), whereas no
significant functional differences were seen for the WT
group (Figure 2(b)). WT and EP2À/À mice had similar
open field locomotor activity, where significant improve-
ments in ambulatory distance were seen at 72 hr when
compared to 24 hr (p < .0001 for both WT and EP2À/À)
and 48 hr (WT: p < .01, EP2À/À: p < .001); whereas, no dif-
ferences were seen between 24 and 48 hr (Figure 2(c)).
Likewise, both groups had significant recovery in stereo-
typic time at 72 hr after ICH when compared to 24 hr
(WT: p < .01, EP2À/À: p < .0001) and 48 hr (WT:
p < .05, EP2À/À: p < .001), with no significant differences
between 24 and 48 hr (Figure 2(d)). These results indicate
that more post-ICH recovery in locomotor activity occurs
within the 48- to 72-hr period, with fewer improvements
between 24 and 48 hr.
EP2 Receptor Deletion Reduces Brain Ferric Iron
Content After ICH
In order to start addressing potential mechanisms of
action, Perls' iron staining was performed to evaluate
brain ferric iron content. In both WT and EP2À/À mice,
deposition of ferric iron (blue) was noted primarily in
perihematomal regions (Figure 3(a)). Quantification of

EP2 receptor deletion on functional outcomes after ICH. Neurobehavioral testing of WT and EP2À/À mice was
performed by investigators blinded to genotype at 24, 48, and 72 hr following ICH. (a) At 48 and 72 hr after ICH, EP2À/À mice had

Furthermore, microgliosis was evaluated by immunohis-
tochemistry for Iba1. When compared with WT controls,
EP2À/À mice had less cortical and striatal microglial acti-
vation and morphological changes as a result of the ICH.
Both WT and EP2À/À mice displayed significantly
increased microglial activation and morphological
changes in the ipsilateral cortex (Figure 4(a)) and stri-
atum (Figure 4(b)) compared with the contralateral
equivalent areas. After quantification, EP2À/À mice had
36.1 Æ 7.5% less cortical microgliosis when compared
with WT controls (1.9 Æ 0.2 A.U. vs. 3.0 Æ 0.4 A.U.,
p ¼ .0220, Figure 4(c)). Similarly, EP2À/À mice had
63.6 Æ 5.2% less striatal microgliosis (3.1 Æ 0.4 A.U. vs.
8.4 Æ 2.5 A.U., p ¼ .0244, Figure 4(d)). The increased acti-
vation and morphological changes were considerably
more pronounced in the ipsilateral striatum when com-
pared with the ipsilateral cortex for both groups (EP2À/À:
p ¼ .0143, WT: p ¼ .0491); although, EP2À/À mice experi-
enced less of a relative cortical to striatal increase in
microgliosis compared with WT controls. No significant
differences in microglial activation or morphological
changes were seen between the two genotypes in the
contralateral striatum or cortex.
Astrogliosis was evaluated by immunohistochemistry
for GFAP. When compared with WT controls, EP2À/À
mice had less cortical and striatal astrogliosis as a result
of the ICH. Both WT and EP2À/À mice displayed signifi-
cantly increased astrogliosis in the ipsilateral cortex
(Figure 5(a)) and striatum (Figure 5(b)) compared with
the contralateral equivalent areas. After quantification,
EP2À/À mice had 80.3 Æ 9.3% less cortical astrogliosis
when compared with WT controls (0.0091 Æ 0.0043 A.U.
vs. 0.0465 Æ 0.0112 A.U., p ¼ .0031, Figure 5(c)).
Similarly, EP2À/À mice had 41.8 Æ 7.7% less striatal
astrogliosis (0.0314 Æ 0.0042 A.U. vs. 0.0540 Æ
0.0083 A.U., p ¼ .0181, Figure 5(d)). The increased astro-
gliosis was considerably more pronounced in the ipsilat-
eral striatum when compared with the ipsilateral cortex
for the EP2À/À mice (p ¼ .0016), whereas no significant
difference was seen for the WT controls (p ¼ .5977), given
the relatively strong cortical astrogliosis in this group.
EP2 Receptor Deletion Reduces Peripheral
Neutrophil Infiltration After ICH
In addition, immunohistochemical staining for MPO was
performed to evaluate peripheral neutrophil infiltration.
MPO þ cells were diffusely distributed throughout the
hematoma, with occasional focal sites of concentration
surrounding blood vessels (Figure 6(a)). Quantification
of brown positive pixel count showed that EP2À/À mice
had 46.8 Æ 7.9% less neutrophil infiltration when com-
pared with WT controls (1.9 Æ 0.3 Â 105 A.U. vs.

Effect of EP2 Receptor Deletion on BBB Breakdown
After ICH
Finally, immunohistochemistry for mouse IgG was
performed to evaluate BBB breakdown. WT mice
had a more diffuse staining pattern when compared with
EP2À/À mice (Figure 7(a)). After quantification of whole
brain brown positive pixel count, EP2À/À mice strongly
tended to have reduced BBB breakdown by 26.4 Æ 8.1%
when compared with WT controls (3.7 Æ 0.4 Â 1010 A.U.

unveil that genetic deletion of the EP2 receptor results in
smaller brain lesion volumes associated with less blood
and ferric iron accumulation. EP2À/À mice also displayed
less ipsilateral hemispheric enlargement and incidence of
IVH. With the neurobehavioral tests employed here, no
significant differences were seen when comparing func-
tional outcomes of WT and EP2À/À mice at the same
time point post-ICH; however, EP2À/À mice did display
improved recovery identified by NDS at 48 and 72 hr.
These improvements in anatomical outcomes and func-
tional recovery were accompanied by less cortical and
striatal microgliosis, cortical and striatal astrogliosis,
BBB breakdown, and peripheral neutrophil infiltration.
Together, these data suggest a deleterious role for PGE2
-
EP2 receptor signaling following ICH.
In the brain, the EP2 receptor has been reported to be
highly and broadly expressed by neurons and glia in the
cerebral cortex, striatum, thalamus, and hippocampus of
mice (Zhang and Rivest, 1999; McCullough et al., 2004;
Ahmad et al., 2006b; Jiang and Dingledine, 2013;
Johansson et al., 2013), where it has been shown to
modulate responses to several CNS insults including cere-
bral ischemia, epilepsy, AD, PD, and ALS (Liang et al.,
2005; Liu et al., 2005; Jin et al., 2007; Liang et al., 2008;

Here, reduced lesion volumes, blood accumulation, and
ferric iron content in EP2À/À mice after ICH suggest a
negative role for EP2 receptor signaling in mediating
blood clearance. A few studies have looked into the con-
tribution of EP2 in modulating phagocytosis in the con-
text of AD, PD, and antibacterial defense in the lung.
Deletion or blockade of the EP2 receptor restored alveo-
lar macrophage phagocytic ability of IgG-opsonized
RBCs in response to stimulation with apoptotic cells
(Medeiros et al., 2009). Activation of the EP2 receptor
by PGE2
and butaprost, a selective EP2 agonist, reduced
b-amyloid phagocytosis by cultured rat microglia
(Nagano et al., 2010). In another study, deletion of the
EP2 receptor enhanced microglial clearance of b-amyloid
in human brain sections and reduced microglial-mediated
b-amyloid paracrine neurotoxicity (Shie et al., 2005a).
Similarly, EP2 receptor deletion augmented microglial-
mediated clearance of a-synuclein aggregates in the meso-
cortex of patients with Lewy body disease (Jin et al.,
2007). These studies collectively suggest that signaling
through the EP2 receptor impairs the phagocytic capabil-
ities of macrophages and microglia, both of which are cell
types responsible for clearance of RBCs and debris fol-
lowing ICH. Furthermore, the EP2 receptor is reported
to be the most strongly expressed E prostanoid receptor
on macrophages (Zaslona et al., 2012). Thus, it is possible

that in this study, EP2À/À mice showed smaller ICH-
induced brain lesions with less blood and ferric iron accu-
mulation as a result of enhanced phagocytic capability,
resulting in improved clearance of RBCs and damaged
tissue.
Differences in the vasculature and susceptibility to col-
lagenase-induced bleeding are other possible mechanisms
that could lead to smaller lesion volumes in EP2À/À mice
following ICH. We have previously shown that genetic
deletion of the EP2 receptor does not significantly alter
the gross vascular anatomy of the brain (Ahmad et al.,
2010). Although we cannot exclude that structural differ-
ences exist in the vessels of EP2À/À mice on a microscopic
scale, which could alter ICH outcomes, we have shown
that the initial bleed volume is not significantly different
between the two genotypes. Equivalent initial hemor-
rhage volumes imply that the underlying anatomical
structure of small penetrating striatal vessels is not sig-
nificantly changed with EP2 receptor deletion and that
these mice are equally susceptible to collagenase-induced
bleeding. These findings further point toward a blood
clearance mechanism as the etiology of improved out-
comes in EP2À/À mice after ICH.
The EP2À/À mice also demonstrated reduced ipsilat-
eral hemispheric enlargement and less incidence of IVH,
which both may simply be attributed to smaller lesion
volumes. However, we cannot rule out that the former
may also be a result of EP2-mediated increased neuroin-
flammation and edema formation in WT mice. Although
we have shown the substantially reduced gliosis in
EP2À/À mice after ICH, additional studies would be
needed to determine whether edema is participating in
the increased ipsilateral hemispheric enlargement and
whether this edema was directly as a result of signaling
through the EP2 receptor. Whereas the decreased inci-
dence of IVH in EP2À/À mice is most likely as a result
of smaller lesion volumes and less extension of blood into
the lateral ventricles. It should be noted that the modifi-
cations we incorporated into the commonly used ICH
model employed in this study (see Methods) resulted in
approximately the same overall incidence of IVH after
ICH as is seen clinically (Bhattathiri et al., 2006;
Moradiya et al., 2014; Poon et al., 2014). Furthermore,
the presence of IVH was accompanied by hydrocephalus
(e.g., dilation or enlargement of the lateral ventricles) as
occurs in patients with IVH alone or who have IVH as a
result of a primary ICH or other type of acute brain
damage (Bhattathiri et al., 2006). Therefore, this modified
ICH model offers two advantages: (a) it results in a more
clinically relevant scenario and (b) it avoids any potential
confounding effects on neurobehavioral testing because
the needle used for injection is not inserted through the
motor cortex.
Functional outcomes were not significantly different
between the WT and EP2À/À mice on any of the
neurobehavioral tests when comparing between these
two groups at each testing time point post-ICH. The dis-
crepancy in correlation between anatomical and func-
tional outcomes could be due to the inherent difficulty
of detecting subtle differences in neurological function
in mice. Moreover, differences in functional outcomes
may be exaggerated and easier to detect at later time
points with this ICH model given the extensive damage
produced early on. Under physiological conditions,
PGE2
-EP2 signaling supports hippocampal-dependent
memory formation and synaptic plasticity and EP2À/À
mice have been shown to have impairments in these pro-
cesses (Savonenko et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2009;
Furuyashiki and Narumiya, 2011). Thus, another pos-
sible reason for the discrepancy could be due to impaired
cognition with EP2 receptor deletion, which could negate
the positive effects of absent EP2 signaling on motor
recovery. Nonetheless, EP2À/À mice did display less
neurological deficits at 48 and 72 hr when compared
with their 24 hr functioning as identified by NDS,
whereas the WT mice did not, suggesting that deletion
of the EP2 receptor improves the rate of neurological
recovery.
Microglia and astrocytes are strongly activated follow-
ing ICH, where they dynamically interact to modulate
inflammatory responses and neuronal survival/injury.
For example, astrocytes can directly mediate neuronal
survival through production of neurotrophic and angio-
genic factors, modulation of neuronal sensitivity to glu-
tamate toxicity and oxidative stress, and downregulation
of microglial secretion of proinflammatory mediators and
reactive oxygen species (ROS; Wang and Dore
´ , 2007b).
However, with excessive activation, astrocytes can also
induce edema, provoke inflammation, and release cyto-
toxins after ICH (Munakata et al., 2013). Likewise,
microglia also have dual roles, where they are protective
in their cleanup of RBCs and tissue debris but toxic in
their release of ROS and proinflammatory mediators.
Deletion of the EP2 receptor resulted in significantly
reduced brain gliosis after ICH, with less cortical and
striatal microgliosis and astrogliosis. These results are
consistent with other studies, which have shown that fol-
lowing various CNS insults, presence of the EP2 receptor
contributes to microglial and astrocyte activation and sig-
nificantly increases the levels of many proinflammatory
mediators (Jiang et al., 2013; Johansson et al., 2013;
Quan et al., 2013). Furthermore, in a few models, neuro-
toxicity was associated with microglial-specific EP2
expression (Shie et al., 2005a, 2005b; Johansson et al.,
2013), suggesting that EP2-mediated microglial activation
and release of proinflammatory mediators from these
cells contribute to neuronal injury. An unbiased micro-
array of microglia derived from mice with EP2 condition-
ally deleted on myeloid cells revealed a significant
reduction in the expression of genes associated with
Leclerc et al. 11
cytokine and chemokine signaling, chemotaxis and cell
adhesion, immune cell activation, and cell cycle/mitosis,
implying an overall decreased inflammatory and prolif-
erative state of EP2 conditional knockout microglia
(Johansson et al., 2013). Of note, COX-2 expression
was also highly suppressed. In the context of the current
study, this point would mean a deleterious positive feed-
back loop exists in the WT mice, where EP2 activation
leads to increased COX-2 expression, PGE2
production,
EP2-mediated microglial activation, and proinflamma-
tory responses (Johansson et al., 2013). Collectively,
these results broadly imply that PGE2
signaling through
EP2 receptors promotes brain inflammation, leading to
microglial-mediated neuronal injury and suggests that the
overall reduced activation state in the absence of EP2
may be responsible for the improved ICH outcomes
seen here.
This overall blunted neuroinflammatory response in
EP2À/À mice after ICH could also explain the reduced
BBB breakdown and peripheral neutrophil infiltration.
In addition to COX-2 suppression, IL-1b, CXCR2, and
MMP-9 are some of the most downregulated genes in
myeloid-specific EP2 conditional knockout mice
(Johansson et al., 2013). Also importantly, this condi-
tional knockout has equivalent attenuation of plasma
TNFa and IL-6 levels as seen in the global knockout
(Johansson et al., 2013), further suggesting the import-
ance of myeloid-specific EP2 signaling in promoting the
inflammatory response. CXCR2 is the main receptor
responsible for neutrophil migration to sites of inflamma-
tion. MMP-9 is known to actively participate in BBB
breakdown and increases capillary permeability, thereby
contributing to brain edema secondary to hemorrhagic
brain injury (Wang and Dore
´ , 2007b). The suppressed
MMP-9 expression from microglia devoid of EP2
would also likely be accompanied by less activation of
MMP-9 due to suppression of ROS and protease produc-
tion from reduced numbers of infiltrating neutrophils and
comparatively less activated microglia. Injection of
recombinant IL-1b into the striatum of rats has been
shown to cause a transient neutrophil-dependent increase
in the permeability of the BBB (Blamire et al., 2000).
Collectively, the reduced expression of these proinflam-
matory mediators in EP2À/À mice could explain the
reduced BBB breakdown and peripheral neutrophil infil-
tration. Furthermore, another related neurotoxic positive
feedback mechanism probably exists, in addition to
the one described earlier, as IL-1b is known to
increase COX-2 expression leading to even higher levels
of PGE2
, further potentiating the microglial-mediated
neuronal injury. Moreover, CXCR2 and MMP-9 may
then be upregulated as these are partially controlled by
COX-2.
Given that we analyzed total brain ferric iron content,
BBB breakdown, and neutrophil infiltration in this study,
an attempt was made to determine whether the differ-
ences seen in these parameters between WT and EP2À/À
mice were mediated by EP2 signaling or as a result of
differences in ICH-induced lesion volumes and blood
accumulation. The values obtained for each parameter
and animal were individually normalized to lesion
volume. In this way, uncorrected and corrected results
can be compared between WT and EP2À/À groups,
where if the same trends are seen in both cases, it suggests
a direct effect of EP2 signaling rather than a blood-
mediated event. Here, we have shown that after individ-
ual normalization for lesion volume, ferric iron content,
BBB breakdown, and neutrophil infiltration all became
nonsignificant between WT and EP2À/À groups, implying
that the improved outcomes in EP2À/À mice resulted
from less blood accumulation and associated brain
damage, further suggesting a possible primary role of
EP2 in negatively modulating microglial/macrophage
phagocytosis after ICH. However, additional focused
confirmatory studies would be needed in order to validate
these indirect analyses implying a blood clearance mech-
anism and assess the complex role of inflammatory medi-
ators. These additional studies should also incorporate
several other approaches to further clarify the role of
the PGE2
-EP2 signaling axis in modulating ICH out-
comes and to begin assessing the clinical utility of target-
ing the EP2 receptor as a possible treatment for ICH,
including the following: (a) additional end points,
(b) extension to the autologous blood ICH model to
address the potential contribution of a collagenase-
induced inflammatory response, and (c) pharmacologic
manipulation of the EP2 receptor with the currently
available selective agonists and antagonists. The latter
studies should also assess the safety and efficacy of such
a pharmacologic approach with a comprehensive evalu-
ation of the possible side effects on other organs or find a
clinically relevant way to acutely block EP2 locally within
the brain.
Collectively, this study reveals a likely deleterious role
for the PGE2
-EP2 signaling axis after ICH. We have
shown that genetic deletion of the EP2 receptor results
in an overall improvement in ICH-induced brain injury,
where EP2À/À mice have smaller lesion volumes asso-
ciated with less blood and ferric iron accumulation and
reduced gliosis, BBB breakdown, and peripheral neutro-
phil infiltration. Thus, modulation of the PGE2
-EP2 sig-
naling axis may represent a new therapeutic avenue for
the treatment of ICH.
