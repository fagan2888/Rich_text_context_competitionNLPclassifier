Abstract
Objective: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1 is a receptor that is thought
to improve recognition of patients with true infection. In this study, we investigated whether
Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM-1) is present in urine samples from children
with urinary tract infection (UTI) and in samples from healthy children.
Methods: A total of 128 samples met the inclusion criteria for the study. Urine samples were
processed for culture and urinalysis as a regular protocol for patients with UTI. Samples were
classified according to culture and urinalysis results. TREM-1 protein expression was detected with
flow cytometry and sTREM-1 was assessed by ELISA.
Results: Flow cytometry showed detectable expression of TREM-1 in 100% of samples, UTI and
non-UTI groups (p < 0.001). Mean fluorescence intensity of TREM-1 was different between the
groups (p < 0.001). Levels of sTREM-1 were detected in patients with UTI, but not in non-UTI
patients.
Conclusions: All of our patients (healthy and diseased) showed TREM-1 expression. However,
TREM-1 levels in patients with UTI tend to be higher and are associated with increased neutrophils
and cytokine activity induced by bacteria.

Introduction
The urinary tract represents a formidable
mechanical barrier to infection. Of the
numerous Gram-negative species of bac-
teria that can cause urinary tract infection
(UTI), uropathogenic Escherichia coli is
responsible for >80% of these UTIs in
uncompromised patients.1 UTI constitutes
the second most common infectious disease
in humans, following respiratory tract infec-
tion. The majority of patients with UTI are
females, ranging in age from the early teen
years to older people. A large proportion
(up to 25%) of these patients will subse-
quently be afflicted by reoccurring or per-
sistent infection. The presence of immune
surveillance molecules is critical to any
immune response mounted by the urinary
tract. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family is
the best characterized of these molecules.
TLR4 promotes vigorous cytokine and
chemokine responses in the urinary tract
to Gram- negative bacteria.1 Interestingly,
recent studies have shown that TLR4 plays
a number of additional antimicrobial roles
that appear to be specific for the urinary
tract.2 Polymorphonuclear neutrophil cells
(PMN) play an important role in the pro-
gression of inflammation. They are the first
cells to be recruited to the site of aggression
and become highly activated by a wide
array of ligands. Receptor-activated PMN
release chemokines and cytokines, such as
tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a),
interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-8, macrophage
inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP)-1-a,
and MIP-1b, among others. The products
of activated PMN recruit more cells to the
inflammation site and actively contribute to
modulation of the adaptive immune
response.3 One novel molecule, the human
triggering receptor expressed on myeloid
cells (TREM)-1, is a 30-kDa glycoprotein of
the immunoglobulin superfamily. In vitro
and in vivo studies have shown that
Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid
cells (TREM-1) expression is strongly
upregulated by extracellular bacteria, par-
ticularly the cell wall component, and by
fungi, although not by mycobacteria. In
contrast, TREM-1 is poorly expressed
in noninfectious inflammatory diseases,
such as psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, and
vasculitis, and in granulomatous disorders,
such as tuberculosis (TB) or foreign body
granulomas. A soluble form of TREM-1
(sTREM-1) is released from activated
phagocytes and can be found in body
fluids.4 The role of TREM-1 in UTI has
been defined in some studies, but to the best
of our knowledge, only the soluble form has
been studied.5
We designed this prospective and ana-
lytical study to measure TREM-1 and
sTREM-1 in myeloid cells in urine sediment
to investigate their role in UTI.
Methods
Subjects
Our study comprised patients who were
outpatients during 1 year at the Pediatric
Urology Department of the Pediatric
Hospital, Western National Medical Center,
National Institute of Social Security (IMSS)
in Jalisco, Mexico. The institutional review
board approved the study (number: R-2010-
1205-9). Patients and parents were informed
about the study. Inclusion criteria were as
follows: children between the ages of 1 and 16
years, both sexes, and those with clinical
632 Journal of International Medical Research 45(2)
symptoms of UTI (frequency, dysuria, and
abdominal pain).
Children with the following specific risk
factors for UTI were excluded: vesicoureteral
reflux, urinary tract stone disease, chronic
renal disease, TB, patients on antibiotics
or immunosuppressor drugs (transplanted
patients), and patients with immunological
or neoplastic diseases. Urine samples were
collected for urinalysis and urine culture in all
of the patients. Diagnosis of UTI was per-
formed according to American Academy of
Pediatrics criteria.6,7
Patients were divided into two groups:
UTI and non-UTI. Nearly 70% of children
who were diagnosed UTI presented with
urinary frequency, dysuria, and abdominal
pain. All patients with UTI (>100,000 CFU/
mL; urine cultures with greater than 100,000
colony forming units (CFU)/mL) were man-
aged with antibiotics. Patients with fever
and macroscopic haematuria were not
included in the study. Patients with negative
results were managed symptomatically.
Patients with <100,000 CFU/ml or two or
more different microorganisms were
excluded. None of the patients included in
the study required management as an
inpatient.
Data collection
Demographic and disease data of patients
included, sex, age, clinical history, urinaly-
sis, urine culture, and sTREM-1 and
TREM-1 levels. Results of TREM-1 and
urinalysis were collected on the sampling
day. Urine culture results were collected 72 h
after sampling. With regard to sTREM-1,
the samples were processed as soon as 40 of
these were accumulated for the enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate.
Urine samples
For sampling, all of the patients underwent
genital hygiene with soap and water in the
laboratory. In the majority of patients,
samples were able to be collected during
the urinary midstream. Young children
required placement of a collection bag.
Urinalysis and urine culture samples were
processed and the remainder (5­15 mL) of
the urine was used for the next step
(sTREM-1, TREM-1, and mean fluores-
cence intensity [MFI] measurements).
All samples were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm
during 5 min. After centrifugation, 1 mL of
supernatant was collected and stored at
À80C until assessment of sTREM-1 by
ELISA. The pellet was prepared and we
subsequently analysed TREM-1 expression
by flow cytometry (FC).
Assessment of TREM-1 expression
by flow cytometry
The pellet was washed three times with 2 mL
PBS and resuspended in 100 mL PBS buffer
added to Fc Receptor Blocking Solution
(BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA). The
cells were then incubated with antihuman
TREM-1-phycoerythrin (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) for 30 min at
room temperature. Subsequently, the cells
were washed with PBS, fixed with 1%
paraformaldehyde, and analysed by FC.
An appropriate isotype control was used to
adjust for discarding a non-specific back-
ground signal. The results are reported as
the % of expression or as the geometric
MFI. For each sample, at least 1,000 events
were acquired in an EPICS XL MCL
(Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA).
Data were processed with WimMDI ver. 2.8
free software.
Measurement of sTREM by ELISA
Supernatants from the groups were collected
to determine sTREM-1 levels. The assay was
performed as described by the manufacturer
(QuantikineÕ; R&D Systems). After stop
solution, optical density was determined
Sierra-Diaz et al. 633
using a microplate reader (SynergyTM HT
Multi-Mode Microplate Reader; BioTek
Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA)
that was set at 450 nm with a 570-nm
wavelength correction. The concentration
was expressed in pg/mL.
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as mean Æ standard
deviation (SD). Comparison of mean values
in both groups was conducted using the
Student's t test. The chi-square and Pearson
correlation tests were used to search for
associations among the variables. The
results were considered statistically signifi-
cant if p was <0.05.
Results
Paediatric patients' characteristics
A total of 469 patients with a clinical
diagnosis of UTI were seen by appointment.
Only 128 patients complied with the inclu-
sion criteria. We only included samples with
appropriate characteristics for the study.
Patients with insufficient urine samples
were excluded from the study. The remaining
341 patients were excluded because they had
other aggregated medical problems (infec-
tious, oncological, immunological, cardio-
vascular, gastrointestinal, and endocrine).
The medical centre where the research was
carried out is a national tertiary care centre.
Therefore, UTI associated with other dis-
eases in children is the most common.
The collected samples corresponded to
75 girls (58.59%) and 53 boys (41.40%). The
median age in both groups was 6 years
(range, 1­15 years). Urine culture and urin-
alysis showed 62 (48.43%) cases of UTI and
66 (51.56%) cases of non-UTI. Table 1
shows the demographic characteristics of
the study groups.
Upregulation of TREM-1 expression
in UTI-infected paediatric patients
FC showed detectable TREM-1 expression
in 100% of samples (UTI and non-UTI
groups). Mean TREM-1 expression was
significantly higher in the UTI group
(43.49% Æ 25.76%) than in the non-UTI
group (11.19% Æ 12.31%, p < 0.001).
A total of 92% of patients with UTI had
TREM-1 levels of >10. Table 2 shows the
proportions of patients in terms of TREM-1
cut-off points.
Upregulation of MFI in the UTI group
MIF measurement was performed in all
samples (UTI and non-UTI). Mean MFI
was significantly higher in the UTI group
(45.77 Æ 8.3) than in the non-UTI group
(32.37 Æ 4.5, Student t test, p ¼ 0.0001).
sTREM-1 is secreted in the UTI group
A total of 80 samples were tested with the
ELISA assay (40 patients with UTI and

40 non-UTI patients). Levels of sTREM-1
were not detected in the non-UTI group. In
the UTI group, sTREM-1 levels were only
detected in 10 (25%) samples. The mean
sTREM-1 value in these samples was
140.6 Æ 253 pg/dL (p ¼ 0.007 compared
with the non-UTI group). Only 80 samples
were processed because we encountered a
technical problem during the thawing pro-
cess in the remainder of the samples, which
could alter the outcome.
Discussion
Neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages
are the primary mediators of the innate
immune response to bacterial infection,
promoting the release of proinflammatory
cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-1b. When
these cytokines are produced in excess, they
contribute to end-organ dysfunction and
overwhelming sepsis. TREM-1, which is
part of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is
upregulated in response to bacteria or fungi.
When TREM-1 is bound to a ligand, it
stimulates the release of such cytokines via
the signal transduction molecule DAP12.
The soluble form of TREM-1 is shed from
the membranes of activated phagocytic cells
and can be quantified in human body fluids.8
Several studies have investigated the use
of TREM-1 as a diagnostic biomarker
and have shown it to be more sensitive and
specific than C-reactive protein (CRP) and
procalcitonin (PCT).8 Gibot et al.9 con-
ducted a study in 76 patients in whom
sepsis was suspected. They found that
plasma sTREM-1 levels were highly accurate
(8.6 LR+; sensitivity, 96%; specificity, 89%,
at a cut-off level of Æ60 ng/mL) for distin-
guishing systemic inflammatory response
syndrome (SIRS) from sepsis or septic
shock. The soluble form of TREM-1 was a
superior diagnostic marker to PCT and CRP
in their study. Our study was not designed
with the aim of determining TREM-1 sen-
sitivity and specificity in urine. However, in
urine, we found that 92% of patients with
UTI presented TREM-1 percentages of
>10%, while in the non-infected group,
only 35% presented similar levels. These
data suggest the usefulness of TREM-1 in
urinary sediment cells as a potential diag-
nostic test.
Su and colleagues reported changes in the
dynamics of sCD163, sTREM-1, PCT, and
CRP during the course of sepsis, as well as
their prediction of outcome in a group with
SIRS (30 patients) and in a group with sepsis
(100 patients). Based on 28-day survival,
sepsis was further divided into survivor and
non-survivor groups. Serum markers and
the white blood cell (WBC) count were
examined on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14. On
admission to the intensive care unit (ICU),
the sepsis group showed higher levels of
sTREM-1, sCD163, PTC, and CRP than
did the SIRS group (p < 0.05). Although
PCT and sTREM-1 are good markers for
identifying severity, sTREM-1 is more reli-
able, and it is a risk factor related to sepsis.
During a 14-day observation in previous
studies, sCD163, sTREM-1 levels, PCT
levels, and Sepsis-related Organ Failure
Assessment scores continued to rise among
non-survivors, while their WBC and CRP
levels decreased. The authors concluded that
sTREM-1 is more ideal for diagnosis of
sepsis and determining severity, and consti-
tutes a risk factor.10,11
Van Bremen et al.12 examined the expres-
sion of TREM-1, TLR2, TLR4, CD14,
and human leukocyte antigen-D related in
blood monocytes and neutrophils using FC
in 22 patients with E. coli sepsis and six
healthy controls. The authors found signifi-
cantly higher expression of TREM-1 and
TLR2 in monocytes and neutrophils in
patients compared with the controls.
TREM-1 expression tended to be higher
(p ¼ 0.07) in monocytes and lower in neu-
trophils of patients with severe sepsis com-
pared with controls. TREM-1 expression in
neutrophils was associated with IL-10
Sierra-Diaz et al. 635
(Lipopolysaccharide: r ¼0.61; p < 0.02) and
TNF-a inducibility (Lipopolysaccharide:
r ¼ 0.78; p < 0.002). The authors concluded
that there was an association of TREM-1
expression in neutrophils of patients with
E. coli sepsis.
The diagnostic value of urinary sTREM-
1 was studied by Long and co-workers
in terms of identification of early sepsis,
severity, and prognosis, as well as secondary
acute kidney injury (AKI). The authors
compared sTREM-1 with WBC, CRP,
PCT, urine output, creatinine clearance
(CCr), serum creatinine (SCr), and blood
urea nitrogen (BUN). This study enrolled
104 patients who had been admitted to the
ICU as follows: 16 patients with SIRS,
35 with sepsis, and 53 with severe sepsis.
Results for urinary sTREM-1 levels, WBC
count, serum CRP levels, and PTC levels
were recorded on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and
14. For the 17 patients with sepsis who
were diagnosed with associated AKI, com-
parisons between their urine sTREM-1
levels, urine output, CCr, SCr levels, and
BUN levels at diagnosis and 48 h prior to
diagnosis were carried out. On the day
of admission to the ICU, the sepsis group
had higher urine sTREM-1 levels and Acute
Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health
Evaluation scores compared with the SIRS
group (p < 0.05). The areas under the curve
as determined by the scores were 0.797 (95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 0.711­0.884)
and 0.722 (95% CI, 0.586­0.858), respect-
ively. On days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14, urine
sTREM-1 levels, serum PCT levels, and
the WBC count were higher in the severe
sepsis group compared with the sepsis group
(p < 0.05). Urine sTREM-1 and serum PCT
levels continuously increased among non-
survivors, while the WBC count and serum
CRP levels in both groups declined. For the
17 patients with AKI, urine sTREM-1, SCr,
and BUN levels at 48 h prior to diagnosis of
AKI were higher, and the CCr was lower
than those in non-AKI patients (p < 0.05).
The authors concluded that urine sTREM-1
testing is more sensitive than WBC, and
serum CRP and PCT testing for early diag-
nosis of sepsis, as well as for dynamic
assessment of severity and prognosis.13
Other authors, such as Derive and col-
leagues, consider that urinary sTREM-1
could become a new biomarker for sepsis-
associated AKI.14 We found that sTREM-1
analysed by ELISA had a frequency of 25%
in infected patients and 0% in non-infected
patients. The strength of this study lies in
determination of the TREM-1 fraction,
which is joined with the cellular membrane,
as well as determination of the MFI.
These variables have not been previously
related to urinary infections in the paediatric
population.
A meta-analysis conducted by Jiyong
et al. evaluated the accuracy of sTREM-1
for diagnosis of bacterial infection. Studies
for inclusion in the meta-analysis were
required to report an accepted test for
sTREM-1 (ELISA). The analysis included
13 studies (980 patients: 557 patients with
bacterial infection and 423 with non-bacter-
ial infection). The global prevalence of UTI
was 56.8%. Global sensitivity was 0.82
(95% CI, 0.68­0.90) and specificity was
0.86 (95% CI, 0.77­0.91). The positive like-
lihood ratio was 5.66 (95% CI, 3.41­9.38),
the negative likelihood ratio was 0.21 (95%
CI, 0.12­0.40), and the diagnostic odds
ratio was 26.35 (95% CI, 0.77­0.91), with
a Q point value of 0.84. The sensitivity of the
sTREM-1 assay for diagnosis of UTI was
low (0.18; 95% CI, 0.05­0.51). The authors
concluded that sTREM-1 may be not a
sufficient biological marker for UTI because
of its low sensitivity.15 None of the studies
described in this meta-analysis reported
determination of TREM-1 in urinary sedi-
ment cells or the MFI.
Jiyong et al.15 included only one experi-
ment in which sTREM was measured in
urine. In Determann et al.'s study, urine
samples were collected from patients who
636 Journal of International Medical Research 45(2)
presented at the emergency room with symp-
toms of lower or upper UTI. For inclusion in
the study, infection had to comprise the
presence of leukocytes (>10 leukocytes per
high-power field) and bacteria in the urine
sediment. Samples were centrifuged at
1,500 Â g for 10 min at 4C and the super-
natant was stored at À80C. Levels of
sTREM-1 were measured by ELISA (recov-
ery, 95­100% in urine; detection limit,
20 pg/ml). Samples from 70 patients with
UTI were analysed. Urine samples of
10 healthy controls and of nine patients
with asymptomatic bacteriuria served as
controls. Patients with UTI were 49 Æ 23
years old and 31 (44%) were male. Culture
was performed in 39 (56%) patients and was
positive (!105 colony-forming units per ml)
in all patients. Fifty-five patients presented
with lower UTI and 15 patients with pyelo-
nephritis/urosepsis. Nineteen patients were
immunocompromised because of diabetes
mellitus (n ¼ 5), use of immunosuppres-
sive drugs (n ¼ 15), or haematological dis-
ease (n ¼ 2). Urinary levels of sTREM-1
were detectable only in 8/55 (15%)
patients with lower UTI and in 5/15 (33%)
patients with pyelonephritis/urosepsis.
Levels of sTREM-1 ranged from undetect-
able to 68 pg/ml in patients with upper UTI.
The authors calculated a specificity of 89%
and a positive predictive value of 93% for
discrimination between UTI and asymptom-
atic bacteriuria. However, sensitivity (19%)
and negative predictive value (12%) were
low. sTREM-1 levels did not correlate with
plasma PCR levels, plasma or urine leuko-
cyte counts, or bacterial species cultured
from urine. Five (26%) immunocomprom-
ised patients had detectable sTREM-1
levels, but these levels were not different
when compared with those of non-immuno-
compromised patients (p ¼ 0.13). The
authors concluded that sTREM-1 urine
levels were low to undetectable.15
In our study, notably, measurement of
sTREM-1 was performed in two similar
groups (infected and non-infected). The
mean sTREM-1 level was 140.6 Æ pg/ml
compared with 68 pg/ml reported by
Determann et al.15 The sensitivity in our
study was similar to that found by
Determann et al. 15 (25% vs 19%).
Regarding our results, the probability of
the test correctly identifying noninfected
subjects was 100%. However, our research
has made a very important point. Using FC,
we measured TREM-1 levels and MFI in
urine, and obtained significant differences
(p < 0.001).
Patients with and without UTI have the
presence of TREM-1 in urine. Urine TREM-
1 levels in patients with UTI tend to be higher
than those without UTI. This finding might
be associated with increased neutrophil and
cytokine activity induced by bacteria.
TREM-1 has been studied in several types
of infections to determine its usefulness in
diagnosis and prognosis of UTI. The use of
TREM-1 and MFI as biomarkers in UTI
should be further evaluated in clinical and
experimental studies.
