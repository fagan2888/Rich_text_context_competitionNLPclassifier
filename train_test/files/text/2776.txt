The primary goal of this study was to test how mother and adolescent proficiency in a common language moderates
the link from parenting to adolescent development. A sample of Mexican-origin fifth-grade adolescents (N = 674, 50%
female) was measured longitudinally on self-control and aggression. Mothers were rated on observed positive disci-
pline, warmth, and harsh discipline. Positive discipline and warm parenting predicted increases in self-control and
decreases in aggression, but only among mother­adolescent dyads who were proficient in a common language. Harsh
parenting predicted decreases in self-control and increases in aggression, but only among dyads who were not profi-
cient in a common language. Similar results were found in a conceptual replication among a second sample of 167
Mexican-origin adolescents.
More than 16 million youth in the United States
have at least one immigrant parent, and immigrant
youth are the fastest growing population of chil-
dren in the United States (Hernandez, Denton, &
Macartney, 2008). The growth of this demographic
group is currently the subject of a nationwide dis-
cussion about the needs and challenges facing chil-
dren of immigrants (Marks, Ejesi, & Garc
ia Coll,
2014). Despite decreases in objective risk factors
(e.g., improvements in socioeconomic status and
English proficiency), later immigrant generation
status (or increased acculturation) is positively
associated with substance use, academic problems,
risky sexual behavior, and externalizing problems
(Bacio, Mays, & Lau, 2013; Bui, 2013; Choi, 2008;
Killoren & Deutsch, 2013; McDonald, Manlove, &
Ikramullah, 2009; Raffaelli, Kang, & Guarini, 2012);
especially important, this phenomena is not limited
to immigrants to the United States but is evident in
Europe as well (Van Geel & Vedder, 2010).
Although awareness of immigrant stress is decades
old, very little empirical evidence is available to
explain why it exists or how it begins. What is
known is that the paradox of later generations
underperforming relative to their immigrant par-
ents has been documented across multiple immi-
grant groups (Garc
ia Coll & Marks, 2012). That is,
how immigration affects family dynamics is a very
large, poorly understood phenomenon with mas-
sive social implications. This study is based on the
acknowledgment that parents are the primary
agents who are invested and responsible for an
adolescent's socialization. The primary goal of this
study was to test how mother and adolescent profi-
ciency in a common language moderates the link
from parenting to adolescent development. We
define proficiency in a common language as either
the speaker or the listener reporting their ability to
perform that task (i.e., speaking or understanding)
in that language as "very well" and the other per-
son reporting their ability to perform the comple-
mentary role in that language as "well" or "very
well." That is, one person (either the speaker or lis-
tener) has to perform their role "very well" and the
other has to perform their role at least "well." If
the developmental tasks of adolescence (e.g.,
identity formation, increased autonomy, abstract
reasoning) place increased emphasis on parent­
adolescent discussion and negotiation, yet those
are less available to many children of immigrants
because of language gaps, adolescents would strug-
gle. Given recent commentaries on the importance
of replication in psychology (Simmons, Nelson, &
Simonsohn, 2011), a second goal of this study was
to test this hypothesis across two independent sam-

ples. Our review of the literature includes studies
of children and adolescents, because research in
this area is limited.
Immigrants and their children are frequently not
proficient in a common language. As immigrant
families spend time in a new country, children typ-
ically master the new language faster than their
parents (Hurtado & Vega, 2004; Veltman, 1988).
However, children of immigrants rarely become
proficient in their heritage language; this is referred
to as limited bilingualism (Portes & Rumbaut,
2001). Among a large multiethnic sample of immi-
grants and their children, Portes and Rumbaut
found that almost no first-generation parents met
their criteria for proficiency in English, and almost
no second-generation youth could be considered
proficient in their parents' native language. Sec-
ond-generation youth retained some knowledge of
their parents' language, enough for limited
exchanges at home, while most parents learned at
least some words of English, leading to "con-
strained but not ruptured intergenerational com-
munication" (Portes & Rumbaut, 2001, p. 144).
Adolescents who are proficient in both their par-
ents' heritage language and the language of the set-
tlement society (in this case, English) adjust more
successfully than do those who are not proficient
in both languages (Portes & Rumbaut, 2001; Sam,
Vedder, Ward, & Horenczyk, 2006; Su
arez-Orozco
& Su
arez-Orozco, 2001). Furthermore, parent profi-
ciency in English is associated with more optimal
environments and outcomes for children of immi-
grants (Hernandez, Denton, Macartney, & Blan-
chard, 2012). In sum, immigrant families in the
United States appear to function optimally when
children and adolescents are proficient in the her-
itage language and when parents are proficient in
the host language (i.e., English). Tellingly, both
adolescent proficiency in the heritage language and
parent proficiency in the host language result in a
circumstance wherein parents and adolescents are
proficient in a common language (because parents
are always proficient in the heritage language and
children of immigrants have near universal profi-
ciency in the host language by adolescence).
For a large proportion of immigrant families, the
asynchronous shift in language use and proficiency
disrupts parent­adolescent communication (Kang,
Okazaki, Abelmann, Kim-Prieto, & Lan, 2010;
Tseng & Fuligni, 2000). Across several ethnic
groups, language gaps between parents and ado-
lescents have been associated with lower levels of
parent­adolescent communication about sensitive
topics (Chung et al., 2007; Kim & Ward, 2007), and
with less observed parent­adolescent communica-
tion in general (Schofield et al., 2012). Together,
these results support the premise that the shift in
language use in immigrant families disrupts
parent­adolescent communication (Hwang, 2006).
These studies are limited in that they have only
considered the direct association between language
gaps and communication. However, this disruption
in communication likely changes the effectiveness
of parenting, as successful parenting is built
around adequate communication with the child
(Baumrind, 1971; Clarke-Stewart & Parke, 2011).
The need for effective communication as a compo-
nent of parenting is sometimes unacknowledged
because in most nonimmigrant families, there is no
language barrier between parents and their chil-
dren. Nevertheless, the disruption to communica-
tion caused by lack of a common language or
limited bilingualism in some immigrant families
may decrease the efficacy of positive parenting
behaviors. As children move toward adolescence
and continue to develop reasoning skills, sense of
identity, and desire for independence, the need for
parenting to be accompanied by consistent and
effective parent­child communication increases
(Steinberg & Silk, 2002). This could explain why
the negative link between immigrant status and
developmental outcomes is seen more during sec-
ondary school than elementary school (Crosnoe,
2012). In contrast to previous work that has tested
for a main effect of parent­adolescent language dif-
ferences on adolescent development, this study
addresses the possible moderating effect of these
language differences on the association between
parenting and development from middle childhood
to early adolescence. We focus on two dimensions
of positive parenting associated with developmen-
tal outcomes among Latino families: warmth or
acceptance (Dumka, Roosa, & Jackson, 1997; Hill,
Bush, & Roosa, 2003; Lindsey, Caldera, & Rivera,
2013; Ozer, Flores, Tschann, & Pasch, 2013; Roosa,
Tein, Groppenbacher, Michaels, & Dumka, 1993;
Valiente, Lemery-Chalfant, & Swanson, 2009) and
positive discipline (Coombs & Landsverk, 1988;
Leidy et al., 2011).
In addition to the integral role of parent­adoles-
cent communication in positive parenting (Harley
& Reese, 1999; LaBounty, Wellman, Olson, Lagat-
tuta, & Liu, 2008; Parke et al., 2006; Pratt & Fiese,
2004), such communication may enable parents to
express more authoritarian or harsh discipline
without negatively affecting developmental out-
comes (Ellison, Musick, & Holden, 2011; Rohner,
Bourque, & Elordi, 1996). Consequently, the largest
COMMON LANGUAGE 215
links from harsh parenting to adolescent develop-
ment would be expected among families in which
parents do not communicate or explain their rea-
sons for their harsh parenting. We include harsh or
hostile parenting in this study because it is associ-
ated with negative developmental outcomes among
Latino families (Lindsey et al., 2013; Parke et al.,
2004).
In the current study, we focus on adolescent
self-control which is reflected in low aggression
and externalizing for several reasons. First, self-
control is a fundamental developmental outcome
(Clarke-Stewart & Parke, 2011) that continues to
cohere during adolescence. Second, many of the
negative outcomes experienced by later-generation
children of immigrants suggest underdeveloped
self-control as reflected in higher levels of external-
izing behavior (Bacio et al., 2013; Bui, 2013; Choi,
2008; Killoren & Deutsch, 2013; McDonald et al.,
2009; Raffaelli et al., 2012). Third, although the
developmental period covered by this study is rela-
tively earlier than mid to late adolescence (when
many of the academic and behavioral differences
associated with later-generation status or accultura-
tion are seen), we consider it an ideal time to study
the antecedent of self-control. Considering the evi-
dence supporting self-control as a cause of later
achievement and behavior (Denson, DeWall, & Fin-
kel, 2012; Dent, 2014), changes in self-control
would manifest before the attendant changes in
these other outcomes.
We hypothesize that the expected links between
positive parenting behavior and adolescent out-
comes will be stronger among families where
mother and adolescent are both proficient in a com-
mon language. We also hypothesize that the
expected negative links between harsh parenting
and adolescent outcomes will be stronger among
families where mother and adolescent are not both
proficient in a common language. Based on the
research just reviewed, we expect that both positive
and harsh parenting will be equally predictive of
these adolescent outcomes. The current study
advances literature on the children of immigrants by
testing these hypotheses using a within-subjects,
longitudinal approach (Marks et al., 2014). Second,
we use observation-based measures of parenting.
Parenting behavior in this area is frequently
assessed via self-reports, the limitations of which
could affect reliability, validity, and statistical power
(Bailey, DeOliveira, Wolfe, Evans, & Hartwick, 2012;
Forman, O'Hara, Larsen, Coy, & Gorman, 2003).
Third, in these analyses we control for several
variables that could account for the hypothesized
association between parent behavior and adolescent
outcomes. Parenting behavior and adolescent out-
comes are correlated with socioeconomic status
(Conger & Donnellan, 2007) and family structure
(Amato, 2005), so we include these as control vari-
ables. Finally, language is a carrier of culture, and
shifts in cultural attitudes have been hypothesized
to account for the negative outcomes experienced by
later-generation children of immigrants. Conse-
quently, we also control for cultural beliefs that
could vary across immigrant parents and their chil-
dren. This ensures that any observed moderator
effects are unique to language match, and not due to
broader similarities or differences in cultural values.
STUDY 1: PRIMARY SAMPLE
Method
Participants. Data for the present report come
from the California Families Project, a community
study of Mexican-origin adolescents and their par-
ents. The 674 families (549 two-parent and 125 sin-
gle-mother) were initially recruited via telephone.
If staff were unable to establish contact over the
phone, a staff member went to the family's home
and made face-to-face contact to invite participa-
tion in the study. The focal adolescent in each fam-
ily was selected at random from the cohort of all
fifth-grade students in two cities in northern Cali-
fornia who were enrolled in public schools during
the academic years for 2006­2007 and 2007­2008.
The first criterion for inclusion in the study was
that the adolescent's biological mother lived with
the adolescent and identified herself as Mexican or
Mexican American. Second, we included both sin-
gle-parent and two-parent families, but, if the
father was in the household, he had to be the bio-
logical father and identify as Mexican or Mexican
American. Third, for father-absent households, the
mother had to report that the focal adolescent's
biological father was Mexican or Mexican Ameri-
can. We restricted the sampling frame to Mexican-
origin families because (1) the labels Latino and
Hispanic mask considerable heterogeneity in race,
ethnicity, nationality, and cultural attitudes and
values, and (2) the vast majority of Latinos in the
Northern California area, and California more gen-
erally, are of Mexican origin. Seventy-three percent
of eligible families agreed to participate in the
study, a rate which is similar to recruitment suc-
cess in other community studies that recruit
216 SCHOFIELD, CONGER, ROBINS, COLTRANE, AND PARKE
multiple family members (Capaldi & Patterson,
1987; Conger & Conger, 2002).
Demographic information for this study is pre-
sented on the left side of Table 1. This study
focuses on data from mothers and adolescents,
when the youth were in the fifth and seventh
grades. Data on language proficiency was not
available for 10 families, resulting in a sample size
of 664 for this study. Adolescents were evenly split
across gender (50% female). We found no pro-
nounced differences on demographic indicators
(i.e., education, income) using census data to com-
pare this sample and the surrounding Hispanic
population of Hispanic families.
Procedures. All measures were assessed when
the focal adolescent was in the fifth grade, with
adolescent outcomes assessed a second time dur-
ing the seventh grade. During these assessment
periods, each family was visited twice in their
homes for data collection, usually within a one-
week period. On average, each home visit took
two to three hours. Each participating family
member completed a set of computer-based
interviews focusing on family processes, individ-
ual family member characteristics, and socioeco-
nomic circumstances. Interviews were conducted
in either Spanish or English, depending on the
preference of the participant. All interviewers
were proficient in both Spanish and English, and
most were of Mexican descent. All measures not
already available in Spanish were translated to
Spanish by bilingual staff members and then
back-translated to English by another group of
bilingual staff members to confirm that the origi-
nal meaning remained clear. Parents were each
paid $100 dollars for their participation, and
children were each paid $50 for their participa-
tion.
During one of the fifth-grade home visits, ado-
lescents were video recorded while engaging in a
20-min discussion task with their mother. Inter-
viewers explained the task, gave prompt cards to
mother and adolescent, and then left the room
while the dyad discussed issues such as how the
family spends time together, enjoyable experiences
they have had, and household rules. Although the
prompt cards included both English and Spanish
prompts, and no instructions were given regarding
language use, the task was always completed in
the language the mother preferred. In no case did
the mother communicate in one language and the
adolescent respond in another language. The
mother's behavior during these interactions was
rated using an adapted version of the Iowa Family
Interaction Rating Scales (Melby & Conger, 2001).
Raters were staff members who received several
weeks of training on rating family interactions,
were blind to study hypotheses, and specialized in
coding one of the interaction tasks. The coders
were trained for months on the nuance of applying
the coding system to Mexican-origin families, all of
the coders were completely proficient in Spanish,
and most were of Mexican origin. Before observing
tapes, raters had to independently rate precoded
interaction tasks and achieve at least 90% agree-
ment with the standard. For purposes of assessing
interobserver reliability, 20% of the tasks were
randomly selected to be observed and rated by a
second observer.
Measures. Dyadic proficiency in a shared lan-
guage. Language proficiency was assessed during
the fifth grade by asking each participant (i.e.,

adolescent and mother) "How well do you under-
stand spoken English?" and "How well do you
speak English?" Parallel questions were asked with
regard to Spanish. These four questions were
answered on a 4-point scale (1 = not at all, 2 = not
too well, 3 = pretty well, and 4 = very well) and were
combined for each participant into ratings of profi-
ciency in each language (for English proficiency,
a = .64 for adolescent and .90 for mother; for Span-
ish proficiency, a = .82 for adolescent and .90 for
mother). Self-reported language measures are
indicative of linguistic ability (Bachman & Palmar,
1985; MacIntyre, Noels, & Clement, 1997; Ross,
1998; Shameem, 1998; Stefani, 1994), and in the cur-
rent study, self-reported proficiency was signifi-
cantly correlated with interviewer reports of how
often they had to help participants communicate in
that language during the interview (1 = never to
4 = many times; r = À.26 for mothers, À.20 for ado-
lescents). Average proficiency in English was
higher for adolescents (M = 3.46, SD = .42) than for
mothers (M = 2.56, SD = .93), r = .72, p < .001. In
contrast, average proficiency in Spanish was lower
for adolescents (M = 2.95, SD = .42) than for moth-
ers (M = 3.46, SD = .42), r = .77, p < .001. To be
classified as proficient in a common language,
either the speaker or the listener had to report their
ability to perform that task (i.e., speaking or under-
standing) in that language as 4 = very well and the
other person had to report their ability to perform
the complementary role in that language as
3 = well or 4 = very well. Any family meeting this
criteria in either language (Spanish or English)
were coded as 1, shared language and other families
were coded as 0, no shared language (cutpoint taken
from Portes & Rumbaut, 2001). Only 1.8% of ado-
lescents and 1.1% of mothers who scored above 3.5
on the language in which they competed the inter-
view were reported as needing any help to com-
municate.
Adolescent self-control and aggression. Mothers
reported on their adolescent's self-control and
aggressive temperament using the Early Adoles-
cent Temperament Questionnaire (EATQ-R: Ellis &
Rothbart, 2001) which shows validity in Spanish-
speaking samples (Poch, Carrasco, Moreno, Jane
Ballabriga, & Anzor, 2012). Following Muris, Mees-
ters, and Blijlevens (2007), self-control was assessed
by the 16 EATQ-R items related to Activation Con-
trol (the capacity to perform an action when there
is a strong tendency to avoid it), Attention (the
capacity to focus attention as well as to shift atten-
tion when desired), and Inhibitory Control (the
capacity to plan and to suppress inappropriate
responses). The scale had an alpha reliability of .79
at the first assessment and .81 at the second assess-
ment. Items were combined into a single scale at
each assessment which served as the indicator of a
latent variable called Self-control (std ks > .80). The
EATQ-R includes a 6-item Aggression subscale that
measures hostile and aggressive behaviors includ-
ing hostile reactivity, person- and object-directed
physical violence, and direct and indirect verbal
aggression. Sample items include "If [adolescent's
name] gets mad at someone, he/she might hit
them" and "[Adolescent] tends to be rude to peo-
ple he/she doesn't like." The items were rated on a
scale ranging from 1 (not at all true) to 4 (very true).
The scale had an alpha reliability of .78 at the first
assessment and .78 at the second assessment. Items
were combined into a single scale at each assess-
ment which served as the indicator of a latent vari-
able called Aggression (std ks > .65).
Observed parenting behavior. At the first assess-
ment, trained observers rated the mother's positive
discipline (i.e., inductive reasoning, encouragement
of independence, and offering adolescent-centered
solutions to problems), warmth/support (i.e.,
expressions of care, concern, support, and encour-
agement), and harsh discipline (i.e., responding to
the adolescent's misbehavior or violation of specific
parental standards through severe verbal or physi-
cal disciplinary techniques). Interrater reliability
was .71 for positive discipline, .73 for warmth/sup-
port, and .85 for harsh discipline.
Control variables. We included parent education
level, generational status, years mother had spent
in the United States, family income, and family
structure (549 two-parent and 125 single-mother
families) as controls. To assess parent educational
attainment, we used mother's self-reported years of
schooling completed in single-parent families; in
two-parent families, we used the highest value
from mother's and father's years of schooling com-
pleted. To assess family income, we used mothers'
self-report of income in single-mother households
and the sum of mother and father self-reports in
two-parent families. Income was reported in incre-
ments of $5,000.
Cultural beliefs were assessed using mother and
adolescent reports of the Mexican American Cul-
tural Values Scale (MACVS; Knight et al., 2010).
The MACVS includes 50 items which are com-
prised of six scales assessing Mexican American
values (i.e., familism-support, familism-obligations,
familism-referent, respect, religion, and traditional
gender roles) as well as three scales assessing
mainstream values (i.e., material success,
218 SCHOFIELD, CONGER, ROBINS, COLTRANE, AND PARKE
independence and self-reliance, and competition
and personal achievement). Knight and colleagues
combine these scales into two higher-order com-
posites (i.e., Mexican American values and main-
stream values), and these two composite scales
were included as covariates (a's > .75).
Analyses. Study hypotheses were evaluated
using structural equation models. We assessed
model fit using the standard chi-square index of
statistical fit that is routinely provided under max-
imum-likelihood estimation of parameters. We also
used two indexes of practical model fit, the root
mean square error of approximation (RMSEA;
Browne & Cudeck, 1993) and the Tucker­Lewis
index (TLI; Tucker & Lewis, 1973). RMSEA values
under .06 and TLI values >.90 indicate close fit to
the data (Hu & Bentler, 1999). Family structure,
generational status, time in the United States, and
cultural beliefs were included as covariates, but
none had a unique association with change in
adolescent outcomes and were consequently
excluded from the final analyses reported below.
However, all reported associations remained sig-
nificant when these variables were included in the
models.
Results
We first ran analyses establishing measurement
invariance across groups (i.e., mother­adolescent
dyads with and without a common language), in
order to test whether the latent factors could be
considered equivalent across the two groups. We
used Mplus version 6 (Muth
en & Muth
en, 2006) to
estimate the models using full information maxi-
mum-likelihood estimation. Missingness was
unrelated to the common language grouping vari-
able. We first fit a seven-factor model using parent-
ing behaviors and adolescent outcomes at the fifth
grade, as well as adolescent outcomes at the sev-
enth grade. A series of analyses demonstrated
strong factorial invariance across groups for all
variables (Meredith, 1993; see the appendix). Par-
enting behavior did not show mean-level differ-
ences across the two groups.
Correlations among variables are presented in
Table 2. Both self-control and aggression showed
stability over time (rs > .65). Positive discipline and
warmth were positively correlated (r > .60) and
both were negatively associated with harsh disci-
pline, although these associations were not always
statistically significant.
We regressed adolescent outcomes at the sev-
enth grade onto adolescent outcomes at the fifth
grade, mother observed parenting, parent educa-
tion, and family income. We ran separate models
for each mother parenting behavior. Each model
was fit separately for the two groups (the 413
mother­adolescent dyads which shared a com-
mon language, and the 251 mother­adolescent
dyads which did not share a common language).
We then compared these nonconstrained models
to constrained models in which the path from
mother behavior to change in adolescent out-
comes was equated across groups. In five of six
paths, the coefficient from parenting to change in
adolescent outcomes was significantly different
between the two groups. Figure 1 includes the
standardized coefficients reflecting the association
between observed parenting and relative change
over time in adolescent outcomes (control vari-
ables are omitted from the figure to facilitate pre-
sentation).

We expected positive parenting to be especially
predictive of adolescent outcomes among families
in which the mother and adolescent share a com-
mon language; results supported this hypothesis.
For example, Panel A in Figure 1 contains the
coefficients for the three models predicting rank-
order change in adolescent self-control. The first
model, Model 1, shows mother positive discipline
to predict rank-order increases in adolescent self-
control among mother­adolescent dyads that share
proficiency in a common language (b = .14,
p = .01) but no significant association among par-
ent­adolescent dyads that lack proficiency in a
common language (b = À.07, p = .33). These paths
were significantly different across groups,
Dv2 = 4.91, df = 1, p = .027. Mother warmth
(Model 2) showed a similar difference across
groups. Mother harsh discipline (Model 3) was
not significantly associated with change in adoles-
cent self-control among dyads that shared a com-

in adolescent self-control among mother­adoles-

Panel B in Figure 1 contains the coefficients for
the three models predicting rank-order change in
adolescent aggression. The first model, Model 4,
shows mother positive discipline to predict rank-
order decreases in adolescent aggression among
mother­adolescent dyads that share proficiency in
a common language but no significant association
among mother­adolescent dyads that lack profi-
ciency in a common language. Mother warmth
showed a similar difference across groups (Model
5), but it was only marginally significant. Mother
harsh discipline was not significantly associated
with change in adolescent aggression among dyads
that shared a common language, but predicted
rank-order increases in adolescent aggression
among dyads that lacked a common language. Sen-
sitivity analyses showed that the pattern of results
did not differ between dyads sharing proficiency in
English, Spanish, or both English and Spanish.

STUDY 2: CONCEPTUAL REPLICATION
Method
Participants. The Riverside Economic Stress
Project (RESP) recruited 167 Mexican American (76
boys and 91 girls) families for participation as part
of a larger study (Parke et al., 2004). Family partici-
pants included a target adolescent who was in the
fifth grade at the time of the recruitment. School
districts supplied researchers with a list of all fifth
graders who were identified as either European
American or Mexican American by the school
records. Families of all children on these lists were
selected at random, called by office personnel from
the adolescent's school, and asked to participate if
they fit the following criteria. The first criterion
was that of ethnic homogeneity (i.e., mother, father,
and adolescent were all Mexican American). The
second criterion was that both biological parents
were married or cohabiting at the time of recruit-
ment. The third criterion was that the adolescent
must have attended school in the United States
starting in kindergarten. Participation rate for eligi-
ble families was 80%. Demographic information for
this study is presented on the right side of Table 1.
The current study focuses on data from mothers
and adolescents, when the youth were in the fifth
and sixth grades. We found no pronounced differ-
ences on demographic indicators (i.e., education,
income) using census data to compare this sample
and the surrounding Hispanic population.
Procedures. All measures were assessed when
the focal adolescent was in the fifth grade, and ado-
lescent outcomes were assessed a second time dur-
ing the sixth grade. During these assessment
periods, each family completed surveys at either the
laboratory or an off-campus location selected to be
geographically proximate to the family's residence.
Families were provided with transportation to and
from the visits, as well as childcare during the visit.
On average, each visit took two to three hours. Each
participating family member--mother and focal
adolescent--completed a set of paper-based inter-
views focusing on family processes, individual fam-
ily member characteristics, and socioeconomic
circumstances. Interviews were conducted in either
Spanish or English, depending on the preference of
the participant. All interviewers were proficient in
both Spanish and English, and most were of Mexi-
can descent. All measures not already available in
Spanish were translated to Spanish by bilingual staff
members and then back-translated to English by
another group of bilingual staff members to confirm
that the original meaning remained clear. Families
were paid $200 each year for their participation.
The visit included having each individual com-
plete a short questionnaire designed to identify
issues of concern that prompted disagreements
within the family (e.g., chores, recreation, money).
The family was then videotaped while engaging in
a structured interaction task. To start the process,
interviewers explained the task which involved
resolving disagreement among family members
about issues they had cited as most problematic in
the questionnaire described previously. Then, the
interviewer gave the task cards to a family member
and left the room while the family members
(mother, father, and the target adolescent) dis-
cussed the issues for approximately 10 minutes.
These interactions were scored by raters using an
adapted version of the Iowa Family Interaction Rat-
ing Scales (Melby & Conger, 2001). Some of the cod-
ing dimensions available in Study 1 were not coded
in this sample, so we were limited to the two dimen-
sions that were common. Raters were staff members
who received several weeks of training on rating
family interactions, were blind to study hypotheses,
and specialized in coding one of the interaction
tasks. The coders were trained for weeks on the
nuances of applying the coding system to Mexican-
origin families, all of the coders were completely
proficient in Spanish, and most were of Mexican ori-
gin. Before observing tapes, raters had to indepen-
dently rate precoded interaction tasks and achieve
at least 90% agreement with the standard. For pur-
poses of assessing interobserver reliability, 15% of
the tasks were randomly selected to be observed
and rated by a second observer.
Measures. Dyadic communication in a shared
language. Language preference was assessed dur-
ing the fifth grade by asking the mother the degree
to which she spoke English, answered on a five-
point scale (1 = not at all, 2 = very little, 3 = moder-
ately, 4 = much of the time, and 5 = almost always or
always. A parallel question was asked with regard
to Spanish. Adolescent language preference was
taken from their self-report of the degree to which
they spoke/read each language. Similar to Study 1,
to create match scores any family in which both
adolescent and mother scored above 3.5 in the
same language (either Spanish or English) were
coded as 1, shared language and other families were
coded as 0, no shared language.
Adolescent externalizing problems. The EATQ was
not administered in the RESP, so adolescent
COMMON LANGUAGE 221
externalizing behaviors (a = .84 for mothers, and
.90 for fathers) were assessed using the parent
report versions of the Child Behavior Checklist
(CBCL; Achenbach, 1991) which shows validity in
Spanish-speaking samples (Rubio-Stipec, Bird,
Canino, & Gould, 1990).
Observed parenting behavior. At the fifth-grade
assessment, trained observers rated the mother's
warmth/support and harsh discipline toward the
adolescent during a structured interaction task.
Interrater reliability was .77 for warmth/support
and .86 for harsh discipline.
Control variables. We included parent education,
generational status, years mother had spent in the
United States, and family income as controls.
Results
We ran analyses establishing measurement invari-
ance across groups (i.e., mother­adolescent dyads
with and without a common language), in order to
test whether the latent factors could be considered
equivalent across the two groups. We used Mplus
version 6 (Muth
en & Muth
en, 2006) to estimate the
models using full information maximum-likelihood
estimation. Missingness was unrelated to the
language match grouping variable. We first fit a
four-factor model using mother parenting and
adolescent outcome at the fifth grade, as well as
adolescent outcome at the sixth grade. A series of
analyses demonstrated strong factorial invariance
across groups for all variables (Meredith, 1993).
Mother behavior did not show mean-level differ-
ences across the two groups.
Correlations among variables are presented in
Table 3. Externalizing problems showed significant
stability over time (rs > .70). Observed warm parent-
ing and harsh parenting were negatively correlated.
We regressed adolescent externalizing problems
at the sixth grade onto adolescent externalizing
problems at the fifth grade, mother observed par-
enting, parent education, generational status, years
mother had spent in the United States, and family
income. Each model was fit separately for the two
groups (the 119 mother­adolescent dyads which
shared a common language, and the 48 mother­
adolescent dyads which did not share a common
language). Figure 2 includes the standardized

coefficients reflecting the association between
observed mothering and relative change over time
in adolescent externalizing problems. Control vari-
ables are omitted to facilitate presentation, but
were included in all analyses.
Panel A in Figure 2 contains the coefficients for
the model predicting rank-order change in adoles-
cent externalizing problems from mother warm
parenting. The first model, Model 1, shows mother
warmth to marginally predict rank-order decreases
in adolescent externalizing problems among par-
ent­adolescent dyads that share proficiency in a
common language (b = À.17, p = .08) but not
among parent­adolescent dyads that lack profi-
ciency in a common language (b = .08, p = .51).
These paths were marginally significantly different
across groups, Dv2 = 3.06, df = 1, p = .080, and the
prediction from warmth to change in externalizing,
although larger in magnitude than the comparable
coefficient in Study 1, was only marginally signifi-
cant because of the smaller size of this subgroup
(n = 48). Mother harsh discipline (Panel B) was not
significantly associated with change in adolescent
externalizing problems among dyads that shared a
common language, but did predict rank-order
increases in adolescent externalizing problems
among mother­adolescent dyads that lacked a
common language. This difference was significant
across groups. Sensitivity analyses showed that the
pattern of results did not differ between dyads
sharing proficiency in English, Spanish, or both
English and Spanish.
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we proposed that when immi-
grant mothers and their children are not proficient
in a common language, the attendant communica-
tion difficulties compromise the effectiveness of
parenting behavior. Across two samples, we found
support for this hypothesis. Compared with moth-
ers in our sample who did share a common lan-
guage with their adolescent, mothers who did not
share a common language were no different in
their observed parenting behaviors. Nevertheless,
the same kinds of effective parenting behaviors
that typically predict adaptive changes in adoles-
cents did not do so among families in which
mother and adolescent lacked a common language.
This absence of an association between parenting
and adolescent outcomes among the dyads not
sharing a language is noteworthy because it is
inconsistent with the larger literature on parenting
(Collins, Maccoby, Steinberg, Hetherington, &
Bornstein, 2000) and with evidence supporting the
overall salience of these parenting behaviors for
adolescent development among Latinos (Coombs &
Landsverk, 1988; Dumka et al., 1997; Hill et al.,
2003; Leidy et al., 2011; Lindsey et al., 2013; Ozer
et al., 2013; Parke et al., 2004; Roosa et al., 1993;
Valiente et al., 2009).
These findings have considerable real-world
ramifications for this important demographic
group. First, immigrant mothers who do not share
proficiency in a common language with their ado-
lescent behave similarly during a parenting task to
immigrant mothers who do share proficiency in a
common language with their adolescent. If parents
do not differ in observable parenting behaviors,
what is it about language that is important? One
possibility is that a common language facilitates
intersubjectivity, or the mutual understanding that
people share during communication (Rogoff, 1990;
Rommetveit, 1985). This shared understanding is
what would help adolescents understand and inter-
pret parent behavior as motivated by love and con-
cern instead of parent-centered reasons. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to address the
possible roles of parenting and communication bar-
riers in explaining the immigrant paradox. One
rival for our interpretation that communication bar-
riers are the causal moderator of the link between
observed mother behavior and adolescent develop-
mental outcomes involves cultural values. Famil-
gismo, resp
eto, and other cultural values often vary
between immigrant parents and their offspring.
Differences in these cultural values could also
account for any moderating effects of differences in
language proficiency. However, Study 1 included
assessments of those cultural values, and they
offered no support for this rival hypothesis.
Researchers may wish to consider the inverse of
this rival hypothesis; namely, that intergenerational
differences in language proficiency may account
for main or moderating effects of cultural values
on adolescent development in immigrant families.
It may also be profitable to reconsider our interpre-
tation of the widely reported links between bilin-
gualism and positive developmental outcomes,
considering that fluent bilingualism would guaran-
tee parent­child proficiency in a common language
(and the attendant benefits).
Based on the current results, an increased
emphasis is needed on immigrant parents learning
proficient English, or on children of immigrants
becoming proficient in their parents' language. Pol-
icymakers, advocates, and other stakeholders may
favor one of these foci (i.e., children of immigrants
COMMON LANGUAGE 223
becoming proficient in their parents' language, or
immigrants becoming proficient in English), but
these preferences will be necessarily based on crite-
ria other than their ability to facilitate the link
between parenting and adolescent development. To
achieve that aim, joint proficiency in either English
or Spanish suffices.
This study offers several other implications and
directions for future research. Parents are the pri-
mary agents who are invested and responsible for an
adolescent's socialization. If these proximal, guiding
socializing agents are rendered less effective by lan-
guage barriers, yet the developmental tasks of adoles-
cence (e.g., identity formation, increased autonomy,
abstract reasoning) continue to require from adoles-
cents discussion and negotiation (things that are
potentially less available to many children of immi-
grants), those adolescents would likely struggle. If
language barriers were to thwart the already-compli-
cated process of parent­adolescent communication
about standards, educational and family-related
goals, and identity, children may orient away from
their parents over time. Those conversations about
identity, autonomy, and reasoning would conse-
quently be more likely to happen with peers. Such
peer orientation can become problematic if the peers
are deviant (Fuligni, Eccles, Barber, & Clements,
2001). If this dynamic is playing out among large
numbers of children of immigrants, as they commis-
erate with peers they may conclude that their per-
sonal experience of decreased communication with
parents is normative. Although behavioral changes
due to shifts in the adolescent's perception of the par-
ent­adolescent dynamic may first manifest at home,
they would eventually extend out into other social
domains, including the school (Portes & Rumbaut,
2001; Turney & Kao, 2012). Although additional
research is needed to test these ideas, the current
results demonstrate that language barriers alter the
magnitude of at least one socializing agent, the
mother.
The shift in parent­adolescent dynamics sug-
gested by the current results could affect not only
the children of immigrants, but future generations.
First, beliefs about the role of parents and peers
in adolescence could shift across generations. Chil-
dren of immigrants may conclude that very high
levels of peer orientation in adolescence are nor-
mative and either explicitly or implicitly teach
those beliefs to their children. Second, parenting
behaviors could change, as children of immigrants
who grow to be parents shift their parenting
behaviors to align with their shifted beliefs about
the role of parents in adolescence. Although
additional research is needed to test these ideas, it
is clear that positive parenting behaviors and posi-
tive beliefs about parenting are resources that
families work to maintain across generations
(Schofield, Conger, & Neppl, 2014). If lost, the
process of recovery can be a slow one. In sum,
these resources could be inadvertently lost in a
single generation due to language-related barriers,
and take several generations to rebuild. This may
help explain why historically it takes many fami-
lies several generations to completely recover from
the immigration process.
These findings are based on Mexican-origin
families and should be replicated with other eth-
nic groups. Furthermore, this data is nonexperi-
mental and cannot be used to support strong
causal inference. Findings for effortful control and
the inclusion of cultural values as a covariate
were limited to the California Families Project,
because those constructs were not measured in
the Riverside Economic Stress Project. These two
studies included slightly different samples (demo-
graphically speaking) and did not have identical
measures of parenting or child self-control, which
precluded tests comparing coefficients across stud-
ies. Nevertheless, this sort of conceptual replica-
tion is valuable and supports the generalizability
of these findings (Stroebe & Strack, 2014). The
similarity in findings across these two studies, in
spite of differing measures of the central con-
structs, underscores the robustness of these pat-
terns. Although we assume in the current study
that participants in Study 2 elected to complete
the interview in the language in which they con-
sidered themselves most proficient, this is sup-
ported by the positive correlation between
language preference and language proficiency in
Study 1, as well as the finding that people prefer
to participate in interviews using the language
with which they feel most proficient (Portes &
Rumbaut, 2001). Future research is needed to
more completely test these ideas, yet the current
findings offer a very straightforward explanation
as to why, for some groups, immigration heralds
socioeconomic progress, but social and academic
regress. As a field, it may be important to not
overlook the truth that proficiency in the same
language allows people to communicate, and
without communication, social influence necessar-
ily wanes. Advocates of immigrant families could
facilitate children of immigrants learning to speak
their language of origin proficiently, as well as
helping immigrant parents to learn proficient Eng-
lish.
