Article
The psychiatric literature is replete with experiences of per-
sons who have been placed in restraints and seclusions on
inpatient psychiatric units. Persons exposed to these prac-
tices express a range of negative responses from terror or
rage, to feeling stripped of their humanity and overpowered
(Hamrin, Iennaco, & Olsen, 2009; Kontio et al., 2012; Lebel,
2011; Shattell, Andes, & Thomas, 2008). There is no evi-
dence that the use of restraint and seclusion (RS) offers an
effective treatment strategy for psychiatric health care work-
ers to manage persons hospitalized with severe mental ill-
ness (Muralidharan & Fenton, 2006). Sailas and Fenton
(2012) conclude that no recommendation can be made about
the effectiveness, benefit, or harmfulness of RS use based on
randomized controlled studies, and the use of RS should be
minimized because narrative studies have described adverse
physical and psychological harm to patients and staff.
Fatalities and serious injuries to patients and nursing staff
continue to be attributed to the ongoing use of RS (Ferreira,
2010; Norwood et al., 2011). The human, institutional, and
economic costs associated with RS are sizable and have not
been adequately measured.
Literature Review
Definitions of RS use are imprecise and how interventions are
translated into practice is not universally understood. Some
classify RS as treatment failure, whereas others view RS as
effective tools for averting injuries during crises and emer-
gency situations (Geller & Glazer, 2012). These practices
include various physical holds, leather straps, bed nets,
restraint beds, and isolation rooms. The Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (2006) define restraint as "any man-
ual method, physical or mechanical device, material, or
equipment that immobilizes or reduces the ability of a patient
to move his or her arms, legs, body, or head freely" and
seclusion as the "involuntary confinement of a patient alone
in a room or area which the patient is physically prevented
from leaving" (p. 71380).
It was estimated that the U.S. Mental Health System
spends more than US$375 million yearly on the conse-
quences of conflict and containment on inpatient psychiatric
settings (Flood, Bowers, & Parkin, 2008). As the cost of psy-
chiatric care has shifted largely from the states to the jointly
funded federal-state governmental program of Medicaid, the
distribution of quality psychiatric care and inpatient work
environments has not been adequately tracked or evaluated
(Hanrahan, Aiken, McClaine, & Hanlon, 2010). States cut
US$1.6 billion in non-Medicaid mental health spending from
2009 to 2011. As a result of these cuts, inpatient mental
health care is shifting to community hospitals, which rely
substantially on Medicaid for payment (Honberg, Diehl,
Kimball, Gruttadaro, & Fitzpatrick, 2011). Tovino (2007)

Preventing Restraint and Seclusion: A
Multilevel Grounded Theory Analysis
Kelly Carlson1 and Joanne M. Hall1
Abstract
Evidence does not support the use of restraint and seclusion (RS) to contain patients on psychiatric inpatient units, yet these
practices continue to be used and defended. Use of RS often results in serious injuries to patients and psychiatric health care
workers. Media exposure and legal challenges have led to negative opinions about RS but not their elimination. Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration set a firm goal to permanently eliminate the use of RS, emphasizing
that such practices are non-therapeutic. There is agreement that prevention is central to eliminating RS. The aims of this
grounded theory study were to understand the contextual processes in preventing RS and the facilitators and barriers to
prevention practice. Barriers include lack of resources at the micro-level, mismanaged messages at the institutional level, and,
at the policy level, belief that all simply need a "change of heart." Participants in this study did not think that they had adequate
staffing, facilities, or education to prevent RS. Most were unaware of RS prevention policies.

hypothesized that the use of RS originates in the wider, more
global systemic problems of psychiatric care, finance, and
treatment. Despite widespread interest in the phenomenon,
knowledge deficits related to processes that produce change
or reductions in RS use remain static. Translation of best
practice has been slow, complicated by the complex and
uncontrollable environmental variables inherent in RS use
on inpatient psychiatric units (Johnson, 2010). Public poli-
cies play a critical, but often overlooked role in improving
bedside practices and fidelity of public health interventions
that lead to improved outcomes across all health care treat-
ment settings (Mirvis, 2009). Ideally, inpatient psychiatric
settings provide a safe, structured environment, and nursing
care around the clock for persons who are in need of this
level of treatment (Varcarolis, 2013).
Violence in health care is a serious international chal-
lenge, and in mental health settings violence is considered
endemic (Lebel, 2011). Lebel (2011) characterizes violence
as "the portal" to RS use, while, conversely, RS use contrib-
utes to workplace violence. This tri-directional cycle of vio-
lence occurs on the individual (practice), institutional
(management), and regulatory (public policy) levels. Krug,
Mercy, Dahlberg, and Zwi (2002) argue that violence pre-
vention is within the realm of public health, not only because
of the enormous effect violence has on health and health care
services but also due to the roles public policy and regulation
can play in mitigating the consequences. Social values influ-
encing whether interpersonal violence is endorsed or frowned
upon are expressed in the social and economic policies that
preserve socioeconomic inequality and cultural norms, such
as those associated with male dominance over women,
parental dominance over children, and the acceptance of vio-
lence as a way to deal with conflict. For all types of violence,
prevention efforts need to be tailored to social, cultural, and
economic contexts (Krug et al., 2002). Institutional values
play a key role in the ways in which psychiatric health care
workers and patients treat one another interpersonally, and
influence the everyday social norms and attitudes of the
treatment environment.
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA) set a firm goal to permanently
eliminate the use of RS, emphasizing that such practices are
non-therapeutic. Findings contained in a SAMHSA (2010)
meta-analysis suggest that next step to implementing evi-
dence-based best practices involves understanding the con-
textual factors that contribute to an organization's capacity to
implement prevention strategies. More recently, SAMHSA's
National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices
determined that the clinical model called Six Core Strategies
to Prevent Conflict and Violence: Reducing the Use of
Seclusion and Restraint scored an overall rating of 2.8 on the
readiness for implementation scale, reflecting a value just
below being adequate for dissemination. Reviewers found
the availability of implementation materials and availability
of training and support resources to be lacking (Huckshorn,
2012). This study contributed to the RS prevention science
by identifying contextual variables that modulate facilitators
and barriers to RS prevention practices, and by discovering
new gaps in the translation of national policy and evidence-
based best practices.
Aims
The purpose of this grounded theory method (GTM;
Charmaz, 2006) study was to understand the complex pro-
cesses that psychiatric health care workers engage in to pre-
vent the use of RS within the multidimensional context of the
inpatient psychiatric unit. For this research, psychiatric
health care workers were defined as registered nurses (RNs),
licensed practical nurses (LPNs), nurse managers (NMs),
medical doctors (MDs), nurse practitioners (NPs), mental
health counselors (MHCs), administrators (ADMs), activity
therapists (ATs), and policy makers (PMs). PMs with exper-
tise in RS prevention were also included. Exploring pro-
cesses involved in preventing the use of RS in the
psychiatrically hospitalized population of the Southeastern
United States from the standpoints of psychiatric health care
workers, along with significant gray literature (information
contained in government, academic, or business reports that
lie outside the domains of published books and journals) and
policy texts, provided information about a region that is
mostly overlooked in the literature. Specific aims of this
GTM study were to
1. understand contextual processes in preventing RS,
2. determine how resources are used or not in eliminat-
ing the use of RS,
3. explore the role of prevention policies, and
4. describe the facilitators and barriers to prevention
practice.
For the science of RS prevention, SAMHSA (2010) iden-
tified understanding the contextual factors determining an
organization's capacity to implement effective strategies as a
crucial next step toward elimination.
Method
Theoretical Framework
This study was founded on Bourdieu's (1977) critical theory
of practice. Bourdieu (1977) emphasizes that mastery of the
symbolism of social interaction, and the language and actions
of practical, everyday know-how, occurs through a continu-
ous decoding of the perceived, but not consciously noticed
rules and structures of everyday life and practice. Bourdieu's
(1977) dynamic heuristics of practice, habitus, and field
directed the development of micro-, meso-, and macro-anal-
ysis. The study involved semi-structured interviews with 21
participants, and a specific grounded theory process used
Carlson and Hall 3
was that of (Bryant & Charmaz, 2007; Charmaz, 2006;
Charmaz, 2011).
Human Subjects
Prior to recruitment, the study protocol was approved by the
Institutional Review Board at the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville, TN. Before each interview, elements of informed
consent (IC) were explained and the participant's level of
understanding was assessed. After the oral explanation, par-
ticipants read and signed the IC statement and received a
copy. Data were collected from September 2011 through
March 2012. There were no adverse events during the study
related to rights of participants in research. Participants'
identities were protected and names were altered on all
research data. Researchers and transcribers signed confiden-
tiality forms.
Data Collection
The logic of GTM guided the system of data collection
(Charmaz, 2006). For Charmaz (2005), consequences of
knowledge made available and practices engaged in are
"made real in collective and individual life" (p. 514).
Participants from various health care professions, psychiatric
facilities, and Southeastern states were sought to provide a
rich data source. Interviews were conducted with ADMs,
PMs, and frontline psychiatric care providers. Codes and cat-
egories emerged during the data gathering and concurrent
analysis processes.
Interviews
Time and place were determined by the participant.
Interviews were conducted in library rooms and other private
areas, away from the inpatient environment to ensure confi-
dentiality. Participants were not paid for the interview time
itself but received a US$25 gift card. All psychiatric health
care workers were required to have been employed by a psy-
chiatric health care facility in the Southeastern United States
within the past 5 years, as the regulations governing the use
of RS in psychiatric hospitals in the United States were set
forth by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(2006) in the Final Rule (42 Code of Federal Regulations
[CFR] Part 482). Participants were asked to fill out a demo-
graphic form and a 16-item Life Events Checklist (LEC) fol-
lowing the interview. Interviews lasted 30 to 120 min and
were audio recorded with permission, then transcribed
verbatim.
Participants were asked, "Tell me about a time when you
saw a patient who could potentially be restrained or secluded.
What did you or other staff members do to prevent it?"
Subsequent questions and discussion related to the use of
resources, the awareness of prevention policies, and the
facilitators and barriers to prevention practice.
Policies and laws at the state and national levels were
examined to construct a more accurate account of the phe-
nomenon and to interpret contextually how policies affect or
do not affect practice. Categories of knowledge generated
from the individual (micro), institutional (meso), and organi-
zational (macro) standpoints were compared. Contrasted,
deconstructed, and reconstructed meanings from interview
data were also compared with gray literature.
LEC
Understanding potential traumatizing effects of staff expo-
sure to RS is critical to prevention practice (Stromberg,
2012). The LEC is a 16-item screening tool consisting of
items that ask about exposure to 16 different potentially trau-
matic events known to produce post-traumatic stress disor-
der or other post-traumatic problems. The mean kappa
coefficient for all LEC items is 0.61, and the retest correla-
tion at 1 week is r = .82 (Gray, Litz, Hsu, & Lombardo,
2004). The rationale for LEC use was the importance of trau-
matic exposure to RS use and the subsequent psychiatric
health care workers' effectiveness with patients, and the
association between workplace violence and RS use. It was
administered after the interviews.
Participants
The study participants included eight RNs, one LPN, one
NM, one MD, two NPs, three MHCs, two ADMs, one AT,
and two PMs. A total of 21 participants were interviewed
from the states of Virginia, North Carolina, Florida,
Tennessee, and the District of Columbia. The majority 81%
were from Tennessee. Participants were recruited from com-
munity contacts, educational conferences, and professional
organizations. Flyers were distributed and participants were
contacted via phone and email.
Sixteen participants were female and five were male. The
mean age was 47 years, ranging from 23 to 65 years.
Seventeen were older than 35 years. One participant was
African American. This was an educated group with 16 hav-
ing earned at least a baccalaureate. Two had high school
diplomas, one had a technical school certification, two had
associate's degrees, five had master's degrees, and three held
doctorates.
Data Analysis
Prior research showed that there were differing levels of
awareness regarding how to successfully prevent and elimi-
nate RS, and that prevention policies regulating RS use differ
drastically among states and facilities. Data gathering and
analysis focused on creating a theoretical representation of
how psychiatric health care workers prevent and eliminate
RS from various individual, institutional, and organizational
standpoints. As data gathering and analysis continued,
4 SAGE Open
questions about policy and resources emerged. ADMs and
PMs were recruited. According to Charmaz (2006), GTM
works best when the grounded theorist collects and analyzes
the data, ensuring that nuances of meaning, structure, and
process are explored concurrently. Data analysis was ongo-
ing with the assistance of the University of Tennessee
(Knoxville), College of Nursing Grounded Theory Research
Group.
Theoretical sampling at all phases aided clarification of
categories and concepts (Charmaz, 2005). After completing
five interviews, data were coded and analyzed (Charmaz,
2006). Participants offering a more diverse account of the
phenomenon of RS prevention, such as those working in dif-
ferent types of health care organizations, were recruited. This
data gathering led to a systematic exploration of RS preven-
tion policies and how they are implemented by psychiatric
health care workers from several institutions in a locale.
Theoretical sampling included the use of policy and regu-
latory texts, along with interviews of PMs at the state and
federal levels. Theoretical sensitivity called for a more
organic, emergent process of data collection. This heteroge-
neous sample improved the understanding of process catego-
ries from the individual (micro), institutional (meso), and
organizational (macro) levels.
Categories related to RS prevention practice were devel-
oped. Coding included identification of the language of
action related to the practice of RS prevention. As categories
developed, focused coding was used to find the broader cat-
egories summarizing detailed processes described by partici-
pants. Many of these practice actions could not be explained
without examining how they fit together with other catego-
ries (Saldana, 2009). The completed theory must give a con-
cise understanding of a social world, confronting problems
and processes within it (Charmaz, 2005). Trustworthiness
improved via consulting the University of Tennessee
(Knoxville) Phenomenology Research Group.The University
of Tennessee (Knoxville) Grounded Theory Research Group
assisted in the ongoing analysis process and helped deter-
mine data saturation. Constant comparison was used to
explore categories as they related to individual, institutional,
and organizational levels (Charmaz, 2006).
As collection and analysis progressed, policy implications
at the state and federal levels were explored to interpret how
policies affect or do not affect practice. Categories generated
from individual (micro), institutional (meso), and organiza-
tional (macro) standpoints were developed systematically,
and formed a theoretical analysis of the phenomenon that fit
with Bourdieu's theory of practice (Bourdieu, 1977). NVivo
qualitative data analysis software, QSR International Pty
Ltd. Version 9, 2010, was used to assist with organizing and
coding the transcribed interviews and policy texts, as well as
establishing an audit trail. Initial models for theory develop-
ment and concept analysis were prepared using this
program.
Findings
Findings are organized at the micro-, meso-, and macro-lev-
els corresponding to Bourdieu's triune analytics, arranged
from individual, institutional, and organizational
perspectives.
Micro
On an individual level, facilitators to prevention practice
included personal characteristics such as being respectful,
staying calm, and caring about patients. Barriers were con-
versely identified as being prideful, jumping the gun, and not
understanding mental illness. The individual strengths iden-
tified by participants related to personal attributes of the staff
included believing that RS prevention and elimination is
possible, using humor and focusing on self. Individual weak-
nesses attributed to staff consisted of characteristics such as
being burnt out, lacking patience, having no confidence or
being fearful, and behaviors such as rigidly enforcing rules,
being prideful, exhibiting intolerance, disrespecting patients,
or insisting on maintaining control.
Knowing or not knowing what works.The established civil
rights of psychiatrically hospitalized persons include the
principle that patients have the right to experience the least
restrictive means of treatment. On the surface, this concept
appears straightforward. In practice, "distinguishing among
these interventions on the basis of restrictiveness proves to
be a purely subjective exercise fraught with personal bias"
(Sadock & Sadock, 2007, p. 1376). While definitions are
blurry, processes determining the least restrictive interven-
tions are abstruse. The majority of participants answered the
opening interview question using normalized psychiatric
treatment language such as de-escalating, redirecting, dis-
tracting, talking, removing stimuli, self-regulating, and
listening.
First, I try to go and talk to the patient and see what's going on,
see what their needs are. Maybe if something's bothering them,
or just try to talk and listen. If the patient starts to get aggressive,
then we have an alarm that we can hit for the other staff to come.
(Male, MHC)
Participants expressed tension between knowing what
to do to prevent RS yet always being ready to do it. Four
participants stated unprompted that they would not work
in a facility where the use of RS was not an accepted
option.
Reading the signs.Almost all participants referred to some
way of observing or reading changes that signaled the emer-
gence of a volatile situation, potentially resulting in RS use.
However, not all participants believed that RS prevention
and elimination is possible.
Carlson and Hall 5
Participants described the signs they look for in patients
having a hard time, cueing staff members that there is poten-
tial for RS:
A change, not quite calm, but not yet escalated: a change in tone
of voice. Maybe they are responding to internal stimuli,
sometimes they just get a stare, like they are seeing something
that is not part of what's there or they see right through me.
Maybe they have just thrown a hot drink. Pacing, that's a big
one. (Female, RN)
I'm looking at their facial expressions, their tone of voice,
looking at the escalating kind of things that are going on, their
body movements, just trying to read them that way. Does it look
like they're going to come at me and hit me? Or does it look like
they are open to talking? Do I need to come closer or back away?
(Female, RN)
Kontio et al. (2012) suggest that psychotic behavior is the
Number 1 reason RS are used, whether the behavior is
aggressive or not. According to Sadock and Sadock (2007),
in conditions such as acute schizophrenia, severe agitation
occurs due to frightening hallucinations and delusions which
are made more complicated by a sense of paranoia, which in
turn is made worse when the trauma of RS use is added.
Exhibiting symptoms is a way patients attract attention, let-
ting psychiatric health care workers know that they are strug-
gling emotionally or losing touch with outside reality.
One participant described reading the signs as a form of
gambling, with knowledge of the patient as the unknown
card.
For boys who we kind of knew were posturing, we would
challenge them. I've got in people's faces and said, "Go ahead.
Carry out your threat!" I was gambling and guessing based on
my relationship with them. I'm looking for tension in the
shoulders, the shoulders hunched up, fists clenched, tone of
voice, volume of voice, yelling, the language; are they cursing
versus are they just kind of speaking more normally or pacing,
shadow boxing, feet boxing, punching the air, kicking things on
the ground, stomping. (Male, MHC)
Participants talked about de-escalation training as being
helpful. Some had negative reactions to their coworkers use
of RS, rather than knowingly using skills learned in de-esca-
lation trainings to prevent RS. Reading the signs also per-
tained to coworkers who add to the tension in a pre-crisis
situation, increasing the probability of RS use occurring with
a patient which eventually leads to more work for the staff.
Their [staff] pride gets in the way.And those are the restraints that
make me sick, the ones that occur because of staff. (Male, MHC)
I feel like sometimes it's [RS] used as a punishment. Like,
[whispers: No one will know what I'm saying right?]. Because
afterwards it's, "Ok, they won't mess with us again. They won't
do that again" but you know, "put them in a bed net and we
won't have this problem again." So I think it's used as a
punishment instead of de-escalating a person, which is what the
intent of it [de-escalation training] is. To keep them safe. To
keep us safe. There's a perception that it is less work to do a
restraint or seclusion, even though it is a lot of extra paperwork.
(Female, RN)
Psychiatric health care workers who are educated to read
the signs, with persons who are at risk of becoming aggres-
sive and know how to prevent RS use, are less apt to become
victims of patient assaults (Schwecke, 2007).
There was a staff member that got hurt, busted her ear. She
worked at a prison, and she said, "If I could have just done this
hold [demonstrating], I could have stopped everything. It would
have worked alright! It wouldn't have involved so many people."
We can only do approved holds. There was a basket hold and
then the one where you grab around, but it just depends on the
size of the person. There's a new hold that we're doing where
patients lay on their back, arms out, and then someone curls
around the person's thighs. I could not get my arms around a
girl's thighs! That hold is just horrible. Plus, your face is right
there. It's just--that hold, is just--and the guys have to put their
knees between the person's elbow [laughs]. But, in the meantime,
there's a lot of chaos and these things are hard to do. (Female,
MHC)
Knowing how to prevent RS use can be confusing when
the emphasis is placed on how to use RS instead. Stromberg
(2012) suggested that traditional "de-escalation" trainings
are insufficient to change the kind of normative culture of
care where the use of RS is commonplace.
Facing challenging moments without resources. The vast major-
ity, 19 participants, did not feel that they had the resources to
prevent RS use. Staff shortages, along with a lack of educa-
tion and time, and feeling de-valued by their institutions
were often cited as problems endemic to the workplace. This
was described by health care workers as receiving low pay
and not having the resources to do a good job. The physical
environment, architectural layout, staff time, staffing pat-
terns, institutional culture, and unit space were found to be
deficient.
The staff were upset, so the patients pick up on that. No matter
how hard they [staff] try to hide it, they [patients] pick up on it,
and are a bit more on edge. In my case, the layout of the building
and staff not being able to see me or what was going on was the
reason the assault happened. It could have been lethal. (Male,
MHC)
This staff person has been hit more than once. I've seen the way
this staff has talked to patients and approached patients. Maybe
that could have been prevented. I don't think he got enough
training, because his preceptorship lasted just a few days. I
really don't think they're [administration] allowing new staff to
work with someone long enough. (Female, RN)
6 SAGE Open
If there is a unit that ought to be aesthetically pleasing, positive,
therapeutic, it's ours, but it's not. It looks like a broken down
motel. (Male, MD)
Seeing others hurt, experiencing fear.Patients experiencing
fear are often met by health care workers who are also afraid.
Fear has been identified as a challenging barrier to trans-
forming psychiatric health care workers'orientations to more
recovery-oriented paradigms (Ashcraft & Anthony, 2008).
Almost all the participants had seen patients or other staff
members injured during a restraint or seclusion. Seventeen
participants reported on the LEC that they had themselves
been the victim of a physical assault; for example, being
attacked, hit, slapped, kicked, or beaten up at some point in
their lifetime. Two participants had firsthand knowledge of
patient deaths from asphyxiation that were the result of using
some type of restraint.
Several participants revealed that they had family mem-
bers who had been hospitalized on psychiatric units and felt
that they had a stake in improving the experiences of patients
and families on these units. However, the lack of knowledge-
able staff, resources, time, and support from ADMs left these
participants often at odds with their respective institutions
values and priorities when it came to issues of quality of
patient care and value-based priorities.
Meso
Facilitators to RS prevention identified at the institutional
level were meeting people where they are and attending to
safety risks. Participants viewed education, leadership,
administrative support, and appropriate staffing to be the
value-based priorities that facilitated RS prevention.
Obstacles included the perception of scant resources allo-
cated to specific RS prevention practices, staff not being lis-
tened to or included in policy-making processes or
decision-making; and fearing loss of employment.
Being unaware of prevention policy. More than half, 16 partici-
pants were unaware of any RS prevention policies. All par-
ticipants knew of some policies related to how to use RS, but
few had specific knowledge of institutional prevention poli-
cies. The discussions on policies often centered on policies
that were "passed down" to psychiatric health care workers
from their administration, or from state and federal PMs.
Four participants had participated in the creation of preven-
tion policies.
There are the cattle prods of Joint Commission and CMS, cattle
prods are extremely strong, if you are in administration in a
psychiatric facility. I will say that our leadership, the
administrators of the hospital and other people were all very
focused on restraint and seclusion. These were things that were
recorded at every leadership meeting, probably monthly. We had
extensive data. We wanted to be on the cutting edge of every
new practice or strategy that could happen. It was an absolutely
strong focus at the hospital. Now, whether that translated into
much better results, I don't know right this minute. (Female,
ADM)
The message my staff get from me is that restraints are
considered failure in treatment. So, if you're using restraint,
there's a failure in treatment. When we talk about restraints or
using restrictive interventions, we talk about what we could
have done differently. Could we have maybe got somebody that
knows the patient better to talk with them beforehand, did the
patient meet the criteria for seclusion? So why did the patient go
into restraint, rather than seclusion? Seclusion is least restrictive.
(Female, ADM)
Findings at the meso-level demonstrate that the policy of
RS elimination originates at the federal level. Material con-
tained in the Seclusion and Restraint: National Action Plan
(SAMHSA, 2008) is mismanaged at the intersectional, insti-
tutional level, while participants described a wide range of
misinformation used to justify unclear outcomes. For exam-
ple, ADMs expressed being pushed into compliance by uti-
lizing data without fully comprehending the contextual
nuances that underpin prevention practice and demonstrated
misunderstandings about the use of the least restrictive inter-
ventions. If policies are not well understood at the institu-
tional level, implementation on the practice level is near
impossible.
Macro
According to Tovino (2007), high-quality psychiatric health
care treatment is not distributed evenly, and problems related
to access and finance figure prominently. Policy translation
and implementation are contingent upon what has value to
the society at large, the legislative bodies, the regulatory
agencies, the institutional cultures, and the professional stan-
dards of those engaged in psychiatric practice. People have
better or worse mental health depending on where they live
and how their communities are structured and organized
(McKenzie & Harpham, 2006).
Leveling the playing field. Federal PMs expressed lofty goals
and ideals in contrast to frontline psychiatric health care
workers. Trauma-informed care was identified as a way to
respectfully approach patients and staff to level the playing
field.
So it has to be trauma informed care for everyone, you know, to
level the playing field. Trauma informed care is really about
being respectful, respectful to everyone including staff. I mean it
has to be the direct care staff, you know, that's who needs it most
in the industry. (Female, PM)
Seclusion and restraint, first off, are non-evidence-based,
historical interventions that more mimic assault than they do any
Carlson and Hall 7
kind of clinical therapy. There is no evidence for it that they
have any therapeutic benefit. They generally should only be
used as safety measures of last resort in the face of imminent
danger, but over the last fifty, sixty, seventy years they've
become way overused. They were always fairly unregulated and
have caused not only a lot of emotional trauma to both the
people being restrained and secluded but also to the staff being
asked to do it. They've also caused many accidents, serious
injuries and a multitude of deaths. (Female, PM)
Because as far as private hospitals here, they don't think we
have any business in their business. So it's going to be interesting.
But with the USDOJ kind of quietly in the background, and the
fact that these private hospitals are living on Medicaid clients,
I'm going to try and do it. We're going to fix our regulations this
next year. (Female, PM)
Regulation was identified by one participant as the only
viable route to RS prevention and elimination. Providing
health care workers with adequate support and resources to
prevent RS should be a condition for facilities receiving
Medicare and Medicaid payments.
Bourdieusian Analysis and Core Categories
Because the micro- (practice), meso- (habitus), and macro-
(field) levels were analyzed, three major themes constitute
the core categories of the theory (see Figure 1). The follow-
ing analysis is a sequential synthesis of these multilevel
findings in more abstract and theoretical terms. These are
detailed below. This includes an appraisal of how thoroughly
federal policy has influenced the creation of institutional cul-
tures of RS prevention practice and non-violence in the field
of practice, which are identified as essential to RS prevention
ideology, and how fully psychiatric health care workers have
been involved in implementing evidence-based best prac-
tices with fidelity (Lebel, 2011).
It's Just the Business We Are in
On the individual practice level, there are unseen conse-
quences to the violent encounters experienced by psychiatric
health care workers in environments where the use of RS is
commonly practiced. Health care workers distance them-
selves and react without thinking in response to repeated
exposure to violent and traumatic events. These workers cre-
ate personal meanings based on an evaluation of the level of
threat, harm, or challenge experienced; and, by an evaluation
of their perceived options and abilities to mitigate the effects
of the potentially traumatic situation (Van der Kolk, 1996).
Carlsson, Dahlberg, Lutzen, and Nystrom (2004) suggested
that the way the psychiatric health care worker copes with
and handles his or her sense of fear is a decisive factor in how
a potentially violent encounter will progress. Emotional dis-
connection or distancing is a predictable response to pro-
longed stress or fears. This occurs physiologically, with the
down-regulation of corticotropin-releasing hormone,

decreased adrenocorticotropin-releasing hormone, and
increasing levels of testosterone and estrogen. Successive
and repeated stressors can have cumulative physiological
and psychological effects causing the experiences of hope-
lessness in these trauma-exposed individuals responsible for
caring for this vulnerable population (McFarlane & De
Girolamo, 1996). According to Carlsson et al. (2004), this
repeated level of fear can lead the psychiatric health care
worker into a state of chaos, where uncertainty and anxiety
dominate, contributing to the business as usual status quo:
acting without thinking.
As coding progressed, an in vivo category reemerged that
crystallized the theoretical analysis pertaining to individual
practice. Examining these reemerging codes and categories
related to resources such as staffing patterns, time, and space,
the in vivo quote, "It's just the business we are in," summed
up the tensions between and among (a) the belief in and the
knowledge of the possibility of prevention practice actions
and (b) the acceptance of structurally defined and objectively
imposed limitations on prevention practice.
The in vivo quote, "It's just the business we are in," points
to the objective meaning that this business of RS prevention
has for participants. The more psychiatric health care work-
ers incorporate the language of economics and the metaphor
of business, and accept the hegemonic forces of the market,
the less time and other resources are perceived to be avail-
able to make moral decisions about the human beings in their
care. The more the business model is emphasized in practice,
with a focus on its limited resources, whether it be real or
perceived, the more psychiatric health care workers think
they must act out of necessity, rather than acting out of a
sense of moral freedom, or duty to care for their patients. The
following participant quote depicts what it means to be in the
business we are in:
We don't have the space [to prevent RS], and I think
administration gets frustrated with that too. You know, dealing
with a building that really just, that needs, we need, I mean it's
awful. It's painfully obvious. I even know that engineering gets
frustrated trying to keep up. You know, it's just the business we
are in, but it takes a lot [money] to get a new building. (Female,
NM)
In attempting to reconcile, literally and physically, what
gets in the way of RS prevention practice, this participant
brings up the building she works in. Not only does she reveal
her frustration about the space, she alludes to this lack of
resource as being "painfully obvious." Looking to the future,
she does not have confidence that there will be enough
resources allocated to fix the dilapidated building in which
she works, because it will take a lot of money. Everyone is
frustrated trying to keep up with the physical and structural
deterioration of the building. The aging, outdated building
takes on symbolic meaning and delivers a message that is
unmistakable. It is asking too much to prevent RS use when
the structures around you and your coworkers are decaying.
Fatalistically, she declared, "It's just the business we are in."
In other words, it cannot or will not be changed by those in
higher positions in the organization.
Mismanaging the Message
On the institutional level, definitions of RS are not uniform
across psychiatric facilities and ADMs are not well versed in
the most up-to-date best practices. Another participant did
not believe that there are adequate supplies needed for her to
engage patients in meaningful activities because she works
in mental health. Thus, working in mental health means there
is a natural consequence of going without the resources you
need. At this institutional level, RS prevention is not well
understood or valued as a determining factor in creating an
ethic of care. While finances are perceived to be scarce, the
messages passed down to frontline workers are confusing
and paradoxical, especially when it comes to providing
enough resources to maintain an ethic of care on psychiatric
units, including adequate staffing.
The business of RS prevention includes the way psychiat-
ric health care workers see RS prevention practice in relation
to psychiatric patients, the way the message of RS preven-
tion practice gets managed structurally in institutions, and
the way federal-level policy is interpreted. Participants felt
constrained by their environments, further limiting their abil-
ity to experience their work or RS prevention as important or
worthy of investment. Psychiatrically hospitalized people
and the health care workers caring for them are at the mercy
of the profits of market forces, which ultimately determine
how RS prevention or use is practiced. Psychiatric health
care workers often receive mixed messages from leaders: Do
not use RS, but however, do it with the inadequate resources
you have in terms of buildings, staffing, and assistance.
It's a Change of Heart
In direct contrast to mid-level ADMs and frontline workers,
top-level PMs did not see RS prevention as a costly under-
taking. In practice, psychiatric health care workers expressed
despair describing their surroundings and lack of support and
resources. At the institutional level, there was a mismanag-
ing of the message of RS prevention. PMs at the top of the
field considered RS prevention nothing more than a "change
of heart."
It doesn't really cost any extra money. It's a cultural and
attitudinal shift, it's a change of heart. It doesn't cost anything.
It's a culture. What we do is free, there is no dollar sign attached.
Not only that, to tell you the truth, it would be more cost efficient
[to prevent RS]. I mean look what happens with worker's
compensation, or staff injuries or calling out [sick]. When you
have restraints and seclusions it's as traumatizing to the staff as
it is the patients who are being restrained. So I would have to say
Carlson and Hall 9
that the staff, even if they are not bleeding, what happens to
them psychologically? Because they are in an environment
where--what they are doing to people all the time affects them.
That's the long term effects of violence. There is nothing
therapeutic about that. (Female, PM)
The messages of violence prevention and trauma-
informed care are espoused in the ideological spin off.
However, as the macro message starts in the heart and soul of
culture, where the less visible structures organize practice, it
ends up in the mundane world of business as the message
increases in dross and loses meaning.
While examining meanings, it was important to first see
the social in the individual. What people do and think, and
how they interact at the individual and local levels, informs
their everyday ideologies and determines their paths of par-
ticipation in the social world (Charmaz, 2006). These psychi-
atric ideologies are translated through action into the world
of practice where these ideas are produced and reproduced.
The language of psychiatric care processes takes on the ver-
nacular of business as usual.
The first research question examined practice norms and
actions that psychiatric health care workers perform in their
social worlds to prevent RS use. On the surface, this is a
simple question. However, what participants reveal about
how they view their practice environments, their coworkers,
and their workplace hierarchies shed more light on what is
missing for them in their practice worlds than what steps
they take to prevent RS use. Difficult and complex patient
care decisions concerning RS use are made without support,
in chaotic environments where participants feel rushed to act
out of a habit of necessity, acquiesced to, and justified by a
lack of adequate resources. This reveals a notable gap in the
translation of best practices in the area of RS prevention on
inpatient psychiatric units. The messages of trauma-
informed, patient-centered, strength-based, and family-cen-
tered care in the facilitation of quality preventive care and
treatment are not being adequately translated into practice.
There is a disconnection between the ideal types of care pro-
moted by SAMHSA and real-time practice. Access to quality
care and how care is financed figure prominently in this
equation (Tovino, 2007).
Conclusion
The connections among the micro-, meso-, and macro-level
analysis, in concert with the relational characteristics of
practice (individual), habitus (organizational), and field (pol-
icy), form a complex web of facilitators and barriers influ-
encing RS prevention practice (see Figure 2). At each level
of analysis, the core categories are at cross purposes, while
espousing intent to prevent RS use. Concepts, meanings, and
ideologies are put in motion, reproduced and made to work
in the social world of psychiatric RS prevention and use
(Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992). This was a descriptive study
conducted in one region of the United States, and results may
not be transferable to other regions.
Implications
According to these participants, psychiatric health care
workers are not always prepared to prevent RS due to mul-
tiple barriers, including a lack of resources, time, space, and
education, and (mis)managed policy implementation.
Environments of care are poorly designed. Few strategies for
improvement are given. Only one participant, who worked in
an adolescent facility, described any state-level regulations
or oversight from any state agency. The following describes
some possible solutions to these practice-level barriers.
Policy and Procedure
Involving psychiatric health care workers in the crafting of
RS prevention policy is one low-cost, high-impact interven-
tion that has the potential to increase both patient satisfaction
with psychiatric care and staff members' satisfaction with
their job-lives. Opportunities for nurses, MHCs, and other
direct care staff to offer suggestions and to work interprofes-
sionally on quality improvement projects create positive rela-
tionships that change culture. By engaging direct care workers
in creative projects, organizations invite budgetary savings
related to the use of RS, worker's compensation, liability, and
staff turnover (Lebel, 2011). Investing in this simple interven-
tion makes sense, while raising the consciousness of psychi-
atric workers by helping them reorganize their priorities to
align more closely with the RS prevention agenda, rather than
with the objective finality and economic fatalism invoked by
the business model. However, without the cooperation of
state-level regulators, insisting on this level of quality control,
business as usual will predominate.
Trauma-Informed Care
Trauma-informed care involves a reorganization of ideology,
a paradigmatic shift in thinking that can only occur by chang-
ing the structures of care and caring, both visible and invisi-
ble. This involves translating the message that RS use is
traumatizing to both patients and psychiatric health care
staff, including understanding the roles that violence and vic-
timization play in the lives of psychiatrically hospitalized
persons. This challenges the business as usual model of psy-
chiatric care by transforming the power dynamics among
staff and patients into a more collaborative model of coop-
eration, rather than forced compliance. Trauma-informed
care includes the psychiatric health care workers in the equa-
tion by helping them examine their own vicarious traumas
related to violence on inpatient units (Stromberg, 2012).
According to the LEC, 80% of these participants have been
victims of physical assault, and almost all have seen other
staff members or patients injured during a RS.

Specific Mandates
There are clear and purposeful actions that the psychiatric
health care professions are well situated to carry out, in rela-
tion to the business of preventing RS use. First, the informa-
tion and research forming the growing evidence base that RS
use is dangerous and ineffective needs to be compiled and
widely disseminated through education, and applied in prac-
tice. Second, research is needed to develop a body of alterna-
tive intervention strategies to counter the effects of the
language of business deployed in psychiatric care. Third,
nursing and other disciplines have a duty to join together and
support scholarship that reinforces the ethical argument
against the business model of mental health care that sup-
ports the continued use of RS as a valid treatment interven-
tion. This includes advocating for this vulnerable population
of hospitalized persons at the community, state, and federal
levels to assure that they are being cared for in the most
humane and least restrictive manner possible. The preven-
tion of violence in mental health treatment and the promotion
of healing environments are public health priorities. This
amounts to more than just the business we are in.
