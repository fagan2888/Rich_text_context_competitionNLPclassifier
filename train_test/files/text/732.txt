SUMMARY Data from a representative sample of the U.S. adult population obtained during 1971-
1975 were analyzed to provide a profile of blood pressure (BP) levels and related nutritional and
sociodemographic factors. Older adults (aged 55-74 years) had a twofold greater prevalence of high
BP than younger adults (25--54 years), and older black persons had the highest rates. Isolated systolic
elevation was uncommon under 54 years of age, but occurred in 5% to 10% of adults over 55 years and
was less common than systolic-diastolic elevation. In older adults, body mass (weight/height ) had the
strongest relationship to BPof all the nutritional variables. Alcohol consumption and dietary calcium
and phosphorus were associated with high BP, but dietary sodium and salt use were not. The serum
calcium/phosphorus ratio and serum urate were significantly higher in older adults with high BP. In
general, the variables associated with elevated BP in older adults were similar to those in younger
adults, although the strengths of the associations differed. Associations of factors useful for nonphar-
macologic prevention and management of high BP in older persons were suggested from this survey.

HIGH blood pressure (BP) is a common and
important problem in older Americans, but
relatively few data are available regarding its
prevalence and related demographic and nutritional
factors. High BP in older persons carries an increased
risk of mortality and morbidity from cerebrovascular,
cardiovascular, and renal involvement.1-2 In clinical
trials, successful lowering of BP in older persons has
been accompanied by a favorable change in mortal-
ity.3-4 A recent symposium3 highlighted the important
role of nutrition in BP regulation and indicated its
potential use in preventing and managing high BP.
Despite these important health implications, there is
relatively little information in older persons about fac-
tors correlating with BP that could lead to rational
development of life-style interventions. Yet, nutrition-
al interventions are particularly important in older indi-
viduals because drug therapy is associated with greater
untoward effects than in younger persons. Studies of

BP relationships in adolescents and young adults have
provided a scientific basis for nonpharmacologic inter-
vention, and comparable population-based studies are
needed for older individuals.
The National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey I (NHANES-I) examined a probability sample
of the United States population aged 1 to 74 years.
Results provided a rich data source that characterized
BP levels in a representative sample of North Ameri-
cans. Because a broad range of nutritional, clinical,
and biochemical variables were measured, it has been
possible to explore their joint relationships to BP. Uni-
variate and covariate adjusted associations between BP
and nutritional variables have been presented in a de-
tailed report6 for adults aged 18 to 74 years. Our focus
here is on a comparison between older adults and
younger adults. To take into account the complex in-
teractions among nutritional variables, we used multi-
variable analyses to adjust for the effects of important
nonnutritional variables.
Population and Methods
NHANES I was conducted from 1971 through 1975
on a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized
U.S. population with respect to sex, race, age, socio-
economic status, geographic region, and urban-rural
residence.7 Because of special interest in the health and
nutrition of selected subgroups, there was deliberate
802
BLOOD PRESSURE IN OLDER AMERICANS///ar/an et al. 803
oversampling of lower socioeconomic groups, older
citizens, black persons, and pregnant women. The
general survey examined 20,749 persons aged 1-74
years, who represented an overall response rate of 74%
of those selected for the sample. Prevalence data on BP
and dietary intake utilize data from this survey. In
addition to this general survey, a representative sub-
sample of adults aged 25 to 74 years received special
questionnaires and examinations of the cardiovascular,
pulmonary, and musculoskeletal systems, as well as
additional clinical biochemistry determinations. This
subsample of 3854 persons is referred to as the detailed
sample and is used to examine BP correlates and to
develop predictive models of BP because of the avail-
ability of biochemical measurements.
The survey was conducted in mobile examination
units at locations of the sampled populations. Exami-
nations were performed by specially trained teams of
physicians, nurses, and technicians who used a stan-
dard manual of operations. Dietary intake was deter-
mined through 24-hour dietary recall and 3-month
food frequency records. A computer program was used
to determine nutrient values of food consumed. Partici-
pants aged 12 to 74 years completed a medical history
questionnaire, which requested information on health
habits, general medical status, and known disease con-
ditions and medical treatments.
The BP was recorded in the sitting position near the
beginning of the examination, according to recom-
mendations of the American Heart Association. A cuff
was selected that was at least 20% wider than the
diameter of the arm, and adult (13 cm) and pediatric
(9.5 cm) cuffs were available to examiners. The cuff
was deflated at a rate to 2 mm Hg per heartbeat, and
readings were made to the nearest 2 mm interval on the
scale. Diastolic pressure was taken on cessation of
Korotkoff sounds (Phase V) unless there was no loss of
sounds, in which case, the point of muffling (fourth
phase) was used as diastolic pressure. If the latter situ-
ation obtained, this was recorded. Three determina-
tions of BP were made on subjects in the detailed
sample, but for this analysis we have reported only the
first sitting BP measurements. Although we have not
investigated the variation among multiple BP readings
separately for the older age group, we have reported6
an extensive comparison of single and paired BP read-
ings for the detailed and augmented survey groups
across all ages. These analyses indicated that the initial
and subsequent BP measurements yielded essentially
the same means and marginal distributions of catego-
rized pressures. Body measurements, including
height, weight, and skinfold thickness, were made by
specially trained examiners who used equipment de-
signed for the study that was checked weekly and be-
fore each examination series.7
All respondents underwent laboratory assessments
that included hematologic examinations and nutrition-
al biochemistries on serum and urine specimens. On
the detailed sample only, the following serum bio-
chemistries were performed: total bilirubin, aspartate
aminotransferase (formerly serum glutamic oxaloace-
tic transaminase or SGOT), alkaline phosphatase, cal-
cium, phosphorus, and uric acid.8
All analyses were performed by statistical proce-
dures that incorporated the sample weights and the
complex design effects.9 Consequently, the results re-
ported here can be extrapolated to the target U.S. pop-
ulation. Because dietary and drug treatments for ele-
vated BP might alter the prevalence estimates or
interrelationships among BP and other variables, indi-
viduals reporting therapy were considered separately
in the analysis. For prevalence estimates, treated indi-
viduals were classified as having hypertension regard-
less of the pressure recorded in the survey. In univar-
iate and multivariate analyses, treated persons were
included or excluded from analysis.6 There were no
major changes in the relationships when treated indi-
viduals were included, and the analyses in this report
include treated individuals.
Several analytical approaches were used to investi-
gate the relationships between BP and other variables.
First, BPs were used as continuous dependent varia-
bles in multiple regression models. Then, three clinical
categories of BP were made: 1) systolic-diastolic high
BP (greater than 160 and/or greater than 90 mm Hg); 2)
isolated systolic high BP (greater than 160 and less
than 90 mm Hg); and 3) normal BP (remainder). The
weighted mean values for key variables were among
these three subgroups investigated by analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) tests. Older adults (aged 55-74 years)
were contrasted to younger adults (aged 25-54 years)
by use of multivariable models and clinical categoriza-
tion of BP. Statistical significance was determined for
all these methods with use of the sample weights and
the design effects.9 Both biological and statistical con-
siderations led us to separate the groups at 55 years of
age. After this age, the mean diastolic BP for men
plateaus, rather than increases, and the prevalence of
isolated systolic high BP becomes important.l0 Of less-
er importance was the restricted sample sizes available
for analysis, particularly when race-sex separations
were made for each decade. Sample sizes for each
decade and contingency tables for the variables ana-
lyzed have been provided in a detailed report.6
Results
The prevalence of systolic-diastolic BP elevation
and isolated systolic BP elevation are presented in Fig-
ure 1 for male and female and white and black sub-
jects. The prevalence rate increased with age for sys-
tolic-diastolic high BP, and 30% or more of the older
adults had elevated pressures. At all ages after 25
years, black persons had the higher rates. Systolic-
diastolic BP elevation was more common in young
males than females during younger adult years, but at
65 to 74 years of age, females had a higher prevalence
of high BP. All differences were statistically signifi-
cant, although the large sample sizes vitiated conven-
tional use of statistical comparisons, because even
smaller, and potentially unimportant, differences may
have been significant.

FIGURE I. Prevalence of systolic-diastolic and isolated systolic high blood pressure bv sex and race in the
United States population, 1971-1974 (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I).
Isolated systolic BP was uncommon in subjects un-
der 55 years of age, but was present with increasing
frequency after this age. The prevalence was highest in
women, and there were no major differences between
black and white groups. In subjects over 55 years, the
prevalence of systolic-diastolic BP elevation was
about 2.5 times greater than isolated systolic BP
elevation.
Multiple regression models were used to investigate
the joint relationship between variables found to be
statistically significant singly with either systolic or
diastolic BP in order to assess the relative importance
of these independent relationships.6 Prediction models
were developed for men (Table 1) and women (Table
2). Older persons (55-74 years) were contrasted with
younger persons (25-54 years). With this analytical
procedure we selected first the independent variable
having the strongest association with the dependent
variable and thereafter selected the independent varia-
bles only if they provided increments significant to the
explanation of the residual variance in the dependent
variable. Variable selection was terminated when no
additional variable had a significance level less than
0.05. The variables are listed in the forward stepping
order in which they were selected for the final model.
Standardized beta weights are given so that the relative
contribution made by each independent variable in the
model can be observed.
Although the population was grouped by age, the
first variable selected was generally age, except for
diastolic BP in older men and women. The decreased
association between age and diastolic pressure reflect-
ed the trends found in older persons. In men, it has
been found" that the diastolic BP plateaus or declines
after 55 years and it increases only gradually in women
after this age. We selected body mass index (weight/
height2) as the first or second independent variable for
all groups except systolic BP in older women. We
found that skinfold thickness, which is a measure of
subcutaneous fat thickness, added little to the predic-
tion of high BP except in young males. Pulse rate was
directly related to systolic BP at all ages, but was less
strongly related to diastolic BP in young adults. Socio-
economic status (SES) was inversely related to diastol-
ic BP in older and younger men, but not in women,
who were not greatly represented in the work force at
the time of the survey (1971-1975).
Reported dietary intake and serum biochemistries
made significant, but often inconsistent, contributions
to the explanation of BP variance. Alcohol intake had a
curvilinear relationship with BP; heavy alcohol con-
sumers had the highest pressures, while moderate con-
sumers had the lowest pressures, and abstainers,
slightly higher pressures.6 SGOT was selected as a
predictor of BP in the younger groups and may be a
surrogate for heavy alcohol intake. Dietary salt intake

was not significantly related to BP, although we exam-
ined several assessments of dietary salt intake (salt-
shaker use, salty snacks, and sodium content of food).
The sodium-potassium ratio (Na/K) from the 24-hour
dietary recall was related to systolic and diastolic BP in
younger men. Dietary calcium and phosphorus intake
were inconsistently related to BP. On the other hand,
serum calcium and phosphate were frequently related
to systolic and diastolic BP in younger adults. The
relationship was direct for serum calcium and inverse
for serum phosphate, that is, higher serum calcium and
lower serum phosphate were associated with higher
BP. When the Ca/P ratio was used in the analyses, it
proved to have a more consistent relationship.6 Serum
cholesterol was inversely related to BP in older women
only. Serum uric acid was directly related to BP, but
this variable was not consistently selected. Similarly,
hemoglobin concentration was selected in younger
adults, but in older men it was related to diastolic BP.
Relevant variables in older and younger adults were
contrasted for the BP categories (Table 3). The cutoff
BP levels of the prevalence studies (Figure 1) were
used to define the three groups. Because isolated sys-
tolic high BP was not common in younger persons, this
classification was omitted for this group. The variables
were separated into nutritional (and pulse rate) varia-
bles and serum biochemistries because the data dif-
fered in relation to separate subsurvey populations, the
general survey (nutritional), the detailed survey (se-
rum biochemistries), and the number of examinees.
However, the findings for each category were repre-
sentative of the U.S. population. The findings general-
ly confirmed those obtained when systolic and diastol-
ic BPs were treated as continuous variables in the
multiple regression models. However, comparison of
the mean values across the BP categories did not take
into account the confounding and interaction among
the independent variables. Two sets of contrasts were
evaluated statistically. The mean values across the BP
categories were contrasted within each group of older
and younger adults (the column entitled "ANOVA
P"). Most differences were significant, which indicat-
ed that the means were significantly different among
BP categories within the older adult or younger adult
groups. The BP categories, normal and systolic-dia-
stolic high BP, were contrasted across older and
younger groups, and significant differences have been
noted with an asterisk.
This permitted older adults with normal BP to be
compared to younger adults with normal BP, and like-
wise for systolic-diastolic high BP. Within older and
younger adult groups, significant differences between
normal and high BP were found for all listed variables,
except dietary phosphorous in young adults and serum
cholesterol in older adults.
When older and younger adults with normal BP
were compared (Table 3), there were statistically sig-
nificant differences in most of the nutritional variables,
although the differences in mean values were small.
These differences reflected changing nutritional status
and dietary intake in older persons or possibly a cohort

effect, namely, such that the older persons had differ-
ent dietary patterns that persisted to later life. Similar-
ly, the differences in nutritional varibles between older
and younger persons with systolic-diastolic high BP
were small but significant, except for pulse rate. With
respect to serum biochemistries, there were fewer dif-
ferences between comparable BP categories of older
and younger adults. Calcium/phosphorous and SGOT
were not significantly different. For serum phosphate
and urate, there were age group differences in the nor-
mal BP group, but not in the high BP group.
Older adults with isolated systolic high BP had char-
acteristics similar to older adults with systolic-diastolic
high BP except for ethanol ingestion, SGOT, serum
phosphate, and serum calcium/phosphate. The means
of these variables for the isolated systolic high BP
group were not significantly different from those in the
group with normal BP.
Discussion
This national survey provides a useful and unique
profile of the BP of a representative sample of older
Americans and, specifically, permits comparison of
nutritional relationships in older and younger persons.
The survey includes noninstitutionalized older people
aged 55 to 74 years, a population group that often visits
physicians and hospitals for symptomatic problems but
infrequently is the subject of population studies. The
sampling and analytical approaches make the observa-
tions representative of the adult United States popula-
tion with respect to demographic variables, such as
age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, urban/rural resi-
dence, and geographic region. Therefore, the preva-
lence rates for high BP and the correlates for systolic
and diastolic BP can be assumed to represent contem-
porary characteristics of the United States population.
The age limit for NHANES was 74 years, and, there-
fore, the oldest segment of the population and those
institutionalized were not surveyed.
High BP is common in older adults; the prevalence
of systolic-diastolic BP elevation is higher at succes-
sively older ages through 74 years of age (Figure 1).
The only exceptions are a slight decline in men and in
black persons aged 65 to 74 years. The racial differ-
ences in the rates of high BP are most striking in older
adults, although present in younger adults. Interesting-
ly, these racial differences are not found in similar
surveys of adolescents. '2 The prevalence of high BP is
approximately the same in black and white persons
from childhood through 25 years of age, but thereafter,
the prevalence of systolic-diastolic high BP increases
rapidly in black persons. The rate for blacks over age
55 years is l'/2 to 2 times the rate in whites. This
impressive racial difference cannot be explained by
differences in measured nutritional or physiologic
characteristics, but may relate either to other unmeas-
ured environmental features or to genetic differences,
or to an interaction between them.
BLOOD PRESSURE IN OLDER AMERICANS///ar/a/7 et al. 807
Isolated systolic high BP (greater than 160 mm Hg
systolic, less than 90 mm Hg diastolic) is infrequent
until 55 years of age; then the prevalence reaches 10%
to 12% in those 65 to 75 years of age. This rinding is
more common in women than men, but there are no
important black-white differences. Although there is
considerable interest in this entity, the national preva-
lence data indicate that this situation is found consider-
ably less frequently than systolic-diastolic BP eleva-
tion13- '4 through age 74 years. Systolic BP determines
the risk for subsequent mortality and morbidity as well
or better than diastolic BP, but the benefits of treating
isolated systolic hypertension have not been defined in
a clinical trial as they have for diastolic hypertension.l5
The variables associated with isolated systolic high BP
are similar to those related to systolic-diastolic high BP
(Table 3) except for the lesser alcohol consumption,
lower serum calcium-phosphorous ratio, and higher
serum cholesterol. These observations provide some
help in delineating isolated systolic BP elevation as an
epidemiologically distinct entity, but further informa-
tion on differential prognosis and responses to therapy
would be helpful in this regard.
These prevalence rates should be interpreted with an
appreciation for the variability of BP levels and the
potential misclassification if a BP measurement from a
single examination is used for diagnosis. Because hy-
pertension is defined as a persistent elevation of BP
recorded on several occasions over a period of weeks
to months, we have chosen to use the term "High BP"
rather than "hypertension" when categorizing the sur-
vey data. When we selected the cutoff levels for high
BP we considered the differential variability of systolic
and diastolic BP. Systolic BP is generally more vari-
able than diastolic, and the cutoff point was set at 160
mm Hg.13 The cutoff point for diastolic was set at 90
mm Hg, because of the lesser variability of this pres-
sure and the demonstrated benefits of treatment of
pressures above this level. The prevalence rates for
"high BP" are affected by the cutpoints selected and
by regression toward the mean. In this latter case,
initially high BP levels tend to be lower on repeat
measurement. Modest overestimates of the prevalence
of high BP may result, therefore, from surveys. These
overestimates may be greater in older persons who
have greater day-to-day variability in BP, especially
systolic BP.
However, the relationships between high BP and
other variables were not altered in these analyses by
changing the cutoff level. When systolic and diastolic
BPs were analyzed as continuous variables in the mul-
tiple regression models (Tables 1 and 2), the associ-
ations were the same as when the BP categories were
used (Table 3). The multiple regression model tested
for correlations throughout the entire range of BP val-
ues and was not influenced by the cutoff levels. More-
over, in these multiple regression models, variables
were selected only if they made independent contribu-
tions to the prediction of BP not made by previously
selected variables. Categorical analyses were used to
complement the regression model by placing the ob-
servations in a clinical context and by indicating the
magnitude of difference in the variables associated
with selected BP categories.
In general, factors selected in the regression models
were also significantly related to high BP levels, and
the two approaches to the analyses were concordant.
The variables related to systolic and diastolic BP levels
in older adults (55-74 years of age) were similar to
those in younger adults (25--54 years of age). Howev-
er, the explanation of BP variance was less for older
adults; the variance explained (r2) ranged from 0.08 to
0.20 for the older group and 0.22 to 0.24 for the
younger group. Age and body mass were the most
important determinants of BP levels. Even within the
two broad age groups developed for this analysis, age
remained an important correlate for systolic BP but not
for diastolic BP in older men or women. This reflected
the trend of systolic BP to increase throughout adult
life and diastolic BP to plateau or decline."
Another important correlate of BP was adiposity or
body mass, and several lines of evidence10 have sug-
gested that age and body mass have independent,
thought potentially confounding, effects on BP. Body
mass index (weight/height2) was directly related to BP
and was the strongest nutritional correlate selected in
all comparisons except for systolic BP in older men.
This variable provides a crude assessment of weight
for volume and, in older adults, increased body mass
primarily reflects accumulation of adipose tissue. With
aging, the major changes in body mass are increases in
adipose tissue and losses in muscle mass and bone
density.16 In the United States, adiposity increases
through mid-adulthood and then plateaus for men
while continuing to increase in women.l0 Although this
is a cross-sectional survey, a similar association be-
tween body mass changes and BP have been found in a
longitudinal study of adult men.l7 This association has
obvious implications for prevention through weight
reduction and maintenance of leaness. Because the
relationship is similar in older and younger adults, the
benefits of having lean body weight in maintaining
normal BP should be as great in older adults as in
younger adults.
Relatively few dietary constituents have consistent
relationships to BP, and we have presented only those
with significant relationships. A complete assessment
is available.6 These dietary relationships differ some-
what in older persons. The sodium-potassium ratio of
reported food intake was an important predictor in
younger men but not in older men or women (Table 1).
This perhaps reflects, in part, the lower mean sodium
intake of older persons in the United States when com-
pared with the intake in late adolescence and early
adulthood. In fact, if salt use and BP are correlated
across the entire adult age range, the relationship is
inverse because older individuals have lower reported
salt intake and higher BP.6 This survey is cross-sec-
tional and reflects only current measures of nutritional
and health status and does not disclose prior dietary
intake that may have been different or may have acted
as an initiating but not maintaining agent in the genesis
808 HYPERTENSION VOL 6, No 6, NOVEMBER-DECEMBER 1984
of high BP. Moreover, there are problems in reliably
quantifying even current intake, and population sur-
veys cannot delilneate a "salt-sensitive" segment of
the population. Nevertheless, this survey indicates
that, within the range of sodium intake of the older
contemporary U.S. population, there is no significant
correlation beween sodium or sodium-potassium in-
take and BP. Such a relationship can be demonstrated
in cross-cultural comparisons of populations with
marked divergence in salt intake, but rarely within
populations with relatively homogeneous salt use.
A significant, direct relationship is present between
alcohol consumption and high BP in both older and
younger adults, although the reported alcohol con-
sumption of older persons regardless of BP status is
less than that for younger persons. The differential in
alcohol intake between normal and high BP groups is
significantly greater in younger adults, but the rela-
tionship remains significant in older persons. The ef-
fect of alcohol on BP is modified by age, but the
heaviest consumers have high BP regardless of age.
Serum aspartate aminotransferase levels are consis-
tently related to systolic and diastolic BP and to BP
categories. This relationship may reflect excessive al-
cohol consumption and its toxic effect on the liver and
perhaps a pharmacologic effect on BP.
Serum urate is significantly higher in those with
high BP, and the difference is present in older and
younger adults. This association is independent of
body mass (or adiposity), although both BP and urate
levels relate to body mass.6 A previous study" has
suggested that the elevation of urate found in high BP
was related to vascular changes in the kidneys. How-
ever, the similar findings in older and younger men
argue against this explanation, since higher urate lev-
els would be expected in older persons who have more
extensive vascular disease.18
Provocative relationships are present between BP
and serum levels of calcium and phosphorous. Serum
calcium was directly related and serum phosphorous
inversely related to systolic and diastolic BP. The most
pedictive variable was the serum calcium/phosphorous
ratio, which combined the independent relationships
of each. No significant differences were found be-
tween older and younger groups in comparable hyper-
tensive categories. These findings agree with those of
other epidemiological studies of non-U.S. popula-
tions. In Belgian military personnel (mean age, 39 ±
11.5 years), Kesteloot and Geboers19 found serum and
urinary calcium levels to be significantly and inde-
pendently related to BP. Other studies20 2I have con-
firmed the direct relationships to serum calcium.
Moreover, serum phosphorous has been found to be
inversely related to BP in a survey of Swedish men
aged 49 to 50 years, although no relationship was
found for serum calcium.22 Thus, studies of other pop-
ulations support the relationships found in the U.S.
survey, but these findings are counter to studies in
animals and selected patient groups. In the spontane-
ously hypertensive rat, low serum calcium is associat-
ed with higher pressures, and calcium feeding lowers
pressure.23 McCarron and colleagues2425 have found
lower serum calcium and a decrease in the ionized
fraction in hypertensive patients. Reasons for these
discordant findings are not apparent, but they may
relate to dietary preparation and patient selection. Prior
therapy with thiazide diuretics is apparently not re-
sponsible.
In contrast to the conflicting human and animal data
on serum calcium, there is general agreement that cal-
cium intake is lower in those with elevated BP. This
NHANES-1 analysis, a survey of Puerto Ricans,26 and
the findings of McCarron et al.23 indicate a significant-
ly lower dietary calcium intake in persons with high
BP. It is not clear why the directional effects of dietary
intake and serum levels are contrary to each other, and
how survey findings may relate to physiologic regula-
tion of BPby calcium and phosphorous. Several expla-
nations are possible. First, there may be a direct effect
of calcium and phosphorous on vascular tone, and such
a direct action has been demonstrated in physiologic
studies. Cellular calcium flux is linked to membrane
stability and vascular tone, and it has been suggested27
that calcium can increase vascular resistance by mod-
erating the interaction between calcium and sodium
fluxes. The relatively small differences in dietary and
serum calcium and their contrary effects would argue
against a direct relationship to cellular fluxes in BP.
A second possibility is that a hormonal response
could explain the countervailing relationships of di-
etary and serum levels and secondarily influence BP.
A third possibility is that the measured calcium levels
in diet and blood reflect the action or interaction with
other divalent cations. Lead and magnesium are possi-
ble candidates. Magnesium was measured in this sur-
vey and had no consistent relationship to BP.6 Lead has
a direct effect on BP in toxic amounts and the appropri-
ate interactions with dietary and serum calcium, but
blood lead was not measured in NHANES-I. The
mechanism of serum calcium effect on BP cannot be
resolved by a survey approach. Nevertheless, the clini-
cal implications of the calcium/phosphorous relation-
ship and BP are of particular interest because of the
lowering effect of nifedipine on BP, which is a cal-
cium-entry-blocking agent.2* This affords further epi-
demiologic support for the relationship between cal-
cium and hypertension, but does not afford further
leads about the mechanism underlying this relation-
ship.
These analyses have focused on contrasts between
older and younger adults with respect to sociodemo-
graphic and nutritional variables related to BP. The
pathogenesis of BP may differ considerably between
older and younger groups, and many of the aspects on
which they differ were not measured in this survey,
which had a primary focus on nutritional and clinical
features. For example, the relative importance of reno-
vascular hypertension in older individuals was not as-
sessed in NHANES-I nor was the contribution of ar-
terial rigidity to elevation of systolic BP in older
persons. Therefore, while the analyses indicate simi-
larities between older and younger adults in the nutri-
BLOOD PRESSURE IN OLDER AMERICANS///arto« et al. 809
tional correlates to systolic and diastolic BP, there may
be differences in physiologic and biochemical param-
eters that were not (and cannot be) assessed in a large
national survey.
This survey establishes a useful perspective on po-
tential approaches to the prevention and management
of high BP in older individuals. Nutritional factors are
important and, in general, are similar to those in
younger adults. Excessive weight has as prominent an
influence on BP in older adults as in younger adults or
adolescents. Because of the parallel age trends in adi-
posity and BP, much of the increasing incidence of
hypertension at older ages, particularly in women,
might be ascribed to weight gain after 40 years of
age.l0 The data from this survey and similar studies of
nutritionally homogeneous populations do not support
a robust relationship between sodium intake and BP
within the usual range of intake in this country. This
does not infer that restricted sodium intake (below 75-
100 mEq/day) will not lower BP, but it does suggest
that modest changes in salt use may have little effect.
Finally, the potentially important effect of dietary cal-
cium and phosphorous on BP and the reverse relation-
ships of serum levels deserve considerable attention,
especially in older persons who have a lower dietary
calcium intake and who may benefit from calcium
supplementation as a prophylaxis for osteoporosis.
