Abstract
Objective: To investigate cardiac structural changes in elderly patients with obstructive sleep
apnoea­hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) and the impact on left ventricular systolic and diastolic
function.
Methods: The study enrolled elderly patients with OSAHS and age-matched healthy control
subjects. Cardiac structure, left ventricular diastolic function and left ventricular systolic function
were measured using a Doppler ultrasound scanner and compared between the two groups.
Results: The study included 136 patients with OSAHS and 50 healthy control subjects. There
were significant differences in the echocardiography indicators that reflect cardiac structure,
including interventricular septum, left ventricle posterior wall thickness, and left ventricular mass
and mass index between the two groups. There were significant differences between the two
groups in the ventricular septal early diastolic myocardial peak velocity/late diastolic myocardial
peak velocity (Em/Am), mitral annulus Em/Am, and left ventricle posterior wall Em/Am. There
were also significant differences in the indicators of interventricular septum, mitral annulus and left
ventricular posterior wall systolic peak velocity between the two groups.
Conclusion: Elderly patients with OSAHS demonstrated cardiac structural changes and their left
ventricular diastolic and systolic functions were significantly diminished.

Introduction
Obstructive sleep apnoea­hypopnoea syn-
drome (OSAHS) is a common but serious
sleep respiratory disease that can impair the
function of the cardiovascular system. For
example, OSAHS affects cardiac function
and output in many ways, and is associated
with hypertension,1 pulmonary hyperten-
sion,2 vascular endothelial injury, tissue
ischaemia,3 systolic and diastolic dysfunc-
tion, and arrhythmias.4,5 OSAHS is closely
related to the incidence and mortality of
cardiovascular disease, especially in the eld-
erly population.6,7 As the symptoms of
OSAHS are not very specific and the devel-
opment complications is usually occult and
gradual, many patients do not get an accur-
ate clinical assessment and guided treat-
ment. Consequently, their primary diseases
and complications are aggravated and,
ultimately, change from functional disorders
to organic diseases.8 For that reason, the
early detection, diagnosis, treatment and
prevention of the complications associated
with OSAHS are clinically important goals.9
As a result of its rapid development, non-
invasive approach, standardized procedure
and repeatability features, echocardiog-
raphy has been widely used in the clinical
evaluation of cardiac structure and func-
tional changes. It thus makes the early
detection of OSAHS and the relevant car-
diac diseases possible.10
The purpose of this present study was to
investigate cardiac structural changes in
patients with OSAHS and to determine the
impact that OSAHS has on left ventricular
systolic and diastolic function.
Patients and methods
Participants
This prospective study enrolled consecutive
patients with OSAHS who visited the
Key Laboratory of Otorhinolaryngology of
the Health Ministry, Department of
Otorhinolaryngology, Qilu Hospital,
Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong
Province, China, between January 2006
and December 2012. Patients with OSAHS
were diagnosed following a 32-lead
twin polysomnography (PSG) assessment
(Respironics, Murrysville, PA, USA). The
apnoea­hypopnoea index (AHI) was defined
as the total number of apnoea and hypop-
noea episodes per hour of sleep.11 AHI and
lowest oxygen saturation were recorded
during PSG monitoring as described below.
OSAHS was defined as an AHI !5 obstruct-
ive events per hour of sleep.12 Patients with
OSAHS did not receive any specific treat-
ment for OSAHS prior to inclusion in the
study. Exclusion criteria included coronary
heart disease, hypertension, obstructive pul-
monary disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
The control group consisted of healthy
subjects selected from patients who visited
the Cardiovascular Colour Ultrasound
Centre at Qilu Hospital for physical exam-
ination. The control subjects did not have
OSAHS, as confirmed by PSG assessment.
The control subjects also had no history of
hypertension, snoring, sleep apnoea or day-
time sleepiness. Relatives of the healthy
control subjects also provided confirmation
that the control subjects did not snore or
have sleep apnoea. As for the patient group,
control subjects with type 2 diabetes,

coronary heart disease, hypertension or
obstructive pulmonary disease were
excluded. In addition to routine clinical
and laboratory examinations, all study par-
ticipants completed the Epworth Sleepiness
Scale (ESS), which scores the likelihood of
dozing in eight situations (0, no likelihood;
1, slight likelihood; 2, moderate likelihood;
3, high likelihood), giving a maximum score
of 24.13 The age, weight, height and body
mass index (BMI) of all study participants
were recorded.
The study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of Qilu Hospital (No. 9205).
Verbal informed consent was obtained from
all study participants.
Polysomnography assessment of sleep
apnoea
A 32-lead twin PSG monitor (Respironics)
was used to measure various physiological
functions during the stages of sleep in
patients with OSAHS and the control sub-
jects. Polysmith sleep analysis software ver-
sion 10.0 (Neurotronics, Gainesville, FL,
USA) was used to monitor 10 indicators,
including electroencephalogram, subman-
dibular electromyography, eye movement
electronystagmogram, muzzle airflow, chest
and abdominal movement, oxygen satur-
ation, electrocardiogram, leg movements,
body position and snoring. Sleep stages
were scored in 30-s epochs using standard
criteria. Apnoea was defined as the absence
of airflow for !10 s.14 Hypopnoea was
defined as a significant reduction in airflow
(>50%) for !10 s or a moderate reduction in
airflow for !10 s together with an arousal or
oxygen desaturation (!4%).15 The muzzle
airflow was monitored by the triple therm-
ometer; chest and abdominal movement was
monitored by the thoracic/abdominal strain
gauge; oxygen saturation was monitored by
the pulse oximeter; and posture was moni-
tored by a sleep position indicator sensor
(Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands).
Echocardiography
Echocardiography was conducted using GE
Vivid 7 ultrasound diagnostic apparatus
(GE Healthcare Biosciences, Piscataway,
NJ, USA), which includes both a tissue
Doppler imaging (TDI) system and trad-
itional ultrasound functions, and can auto-
matically record each set of test results. The
participants were in the left lateral decubitus
position when their cardiac structures were
monitored using a 2.5­4.0 MHz probe and
conventional transthoracic echocardiog-
raphy (M-mode, two dimension, colour
Doppler) as previously described.16 The
main indicators included left ventricular
diastolic diameter (LV), left atrium diastolic
diameter (LA), right ventricular diastolic
diameter (RV), right atrium diastolic diam-
eter, arteriae aorta diameter (AO), pulmon-
ary artery diameter, interventricular septum
(IVS), left ventricle posterior wall (LVPW)
and body surface area (BSA). The Devereux
formula was used to calculate the left ven-
tricular mass (LVM) (g) ¼ 0.8 Â 1.04 [(IVS þ
LVPW þ LV) 3 À LV3] þ 0.6 and the left
ventricular mass index (LVMI) ¼ LVM/
BSA, where BSA (m2) ¼ 0.006 Â height
(cm) þ 0.013 Â body weight (kg) À 0.153.17
In order to conduct the measurements
effectively, the system was switched to the
TDI speed mode, the filter was set to the
minimum, and the Doppler gain was
reduced appropriately. The sample volume
was placed on the cross of the anterior
mitral valve annulus to measure the mitral
annulus; on the IVS muscular segment to
measure IVS; and on the papillary muscle
short axis to measure LVPW. The systolic
myocardial peak velocity (Sm), early dia-
stolic myocardial peak velocity (Em) and
late diastolic myocardial peak velocity (Am)
were measured separately. All of the images
of mitral early diastolic velocity (E), mitral
late diastolic in velocity (A), cardiac output
(CO), left ventricular ejection fraction (EF),
left ventricular shortening fraction (FS) and
Sun et al. 397
stroke volume (SV) were recorded and
stored. Once recorded, off-line analyses
were conducted to calculate the mean
values for three continuous cardiac cycles.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 11.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Data are presented as
mean Æ SD. The mean values of the two
groups were compared using Student's t-
test. The correlations between BMI and the
main echocardiography indicators were cal-
culated using Spearman's correlation coeffi-
cient because OSAHS is related to
weight.18,19 A P-value <0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
A total of 136 patients with OSAHS were
diagnosed following a PSG assessment (89
male and 47 female; mean age 63.3 Æ 10.6
years; range 50­82 years). The control group
(n ¼ 50) included 37 men and 13 women with
a mean age of 62.2 Æ 10.8 years (range 50­76
years).
The general, hemodynamic, biological,
respiratory characteristics and results of
the cardiac structure echocardiography for
both groups are shown in Table 1. The clinic
SBP and DBP of OSAHS group were higher
than those of the controls. All of the echo-
cardiographic indicators of the cardiac
structure were significantly greater in the
OSAHS group compared with the control
group (P < 0.05 for each indicator).
The Em and Am of the IVS, mitral
annulus and LVPW were compared to
determine the diastolic function of the left
ventricle. The main indicators of the left
ventricular diastolic function are shown in
Table 2. The differences between the two
groups regarding the Em/Am, IVS Em/Am,
mitral annulus Em/Am, and LVPW Em/Am
were all statistically significant (P < 0.05 for
each indicator).
To compare the left ventricular systolic
function between the two groups, CO, SV,
EF, FS and IVS Sm, mitral annulus Sm and
LVPW Sm were measured (Table 3). CO
and SV showed no significant differences
between the OSAHS group and the control
group. However, EF, FS, IVS Sm, mitral
annulus Sm and LVPW Sm showed signifi-
cant differences between the two groups
(P < 0.05 for each indicator).
There was no significant difference in the
BMI between the OSAHS and control
groups. In terms of the cardiac structure,
the BMI of patients with OSAHS was
significantly related to the LV (r ¼ 0.40,
P ¼ 0.028), AO (r ¼ 0.39, P ¼ 0.026), LVM
(r ¼ 0.47, P ¼ 0.031) and LVMI (r ¼ À 0.25,
P ¼ 0.023). The BMI of the control subjects
was significantly related only to RV
(r ¼ 0.51, P ¼ 0.039) and IVS (r ¼ 0.47,
P ¼ 0.041). In terms of the left ventricular
diastolic and systolic function, the BMI of
patients with OSAHS was significantly
related to Em (r ¼ 0.42, P ¼ 0.033), Em/Am
(r ¼ 0.37, P ¼ 0.026), mitral annulus Am
(r ¼ 0.53, P ¼ 0.042), mitral annulus Em/
Am (r ¼ 0.29, P ¼ 0.016), LVPW Em
(r ¼ 0.27, P ¼ 0.023), LVPW Am (r ¼ 0.32,
P ¼ 0.027) and LVPW Em/Am (r ¼ À0.29,
P ¼ 0.018). The BMI of control subjects was
significantly related to the mitral annulus
Em (r ¼ 0.38, P ¼ 0.042) and LVPW Am
(r ¼ 0.52, P ¼ 0.037).
Conversely, the AHI of patients with
OSAHS was significantly related to LV
(r ¼ 0.37, P ¼ 0.021), LA (r ¼ 0.43,
P ¼ 0.041), RA (r ¼ 0.53, P ¼ 0.049), LVM
(r ¼ 0.31, P ¼ 0.042) and LVMI (r ¼ À0.25,
P ¼ 0.023). The AHI of the control subjects
was not significantly related to these vari-
ables. In terms of the left ventricular dia-
stolic and systolic function, the AHI of
patients with OSAHS was significantly
related to Em (r ¼ 0.56, P ¼ 0.025), Em/Am
398 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
(r ¼ 0.41, P ¼ 0.032), IVS Em (r ¼ 0.61,
P ¼ 0.047), IVS Em/Am (r ¼ 0.51,
P ¼ 0.029), mitral annulus Em/Am
(r ¼ 0.24, P ¼ 0.019), LVPW Em (r ¼ 0.31,
P ¼ 0.029), LVPW Am (r ¼ 0.45, P ¼ 0.033)
and LVPW Em/Am (r ¼ À0.26, P ¼ 0.037).
The AHI of control subjects was not signifi-
cantly related to left ventricular diastolic
and systolic function.
Discussion
Three physiological mechanisms associated
with OSAHS are generally considered to
cause left ventricular hypertrophy: (i) the
increased haemodynamic load that results
from the increased blood pressure that is
often observed in patients with OSAHS,
which rises continually and does not drop
down at night, causing the left ventricle to

patients with OSAHS.24 Endothelin is
involved in cardiac hypertrophy through
several mechanisms of action. First,
endothelin has powerful vasoconstrictor
effects.24 Endothelin induces the prolifer-
ation and hypertrophy of vascular smooth
muscle cells, narrows the vascular lumen,
thickens the vascular wall and increases
peripheral resistance, which results in an
increase in the cardiac afterload.24 Secondly,
endothelin increases mitosis in cardiomyo-
cytes and fibroblasts, thus causing cell pro-
liferation, intracellular calcium overload
and proto-oncogene expression, which pro-
motes DNA and protein synthesis, and in
turn eventually increases cardiac hypertro-
phy.24 Thirdly, endothelin and angiotensin
II promote the expression of each other's
encoding gene in a positive feedback
manner.25,26 This present study found sig-
nificant differences in IVS, LVPW, LVM
and LVMI between the OSAHS group and
the control group.
When a patient with OSAHS is in
apnoea, the formation of an extreme
intrathoracic negative pressure causes rapid
changes in the ventricular transmural pres-
sure, which results in an increased myocar-
dial wall pressure and afterload.27 In
addition, the apnoea causes hypoxaemia
and hypercapnia, which lead to pulmonary
vasoconstriction, pulmonary pressure and
increased right ventricular afterload.27
When coupled with the increased intrathor-
acic pressure and returned blood volume,
the right ventricular volume is overloaded
and becomes an easy trigger for right heart
failure.28,29 Moreover, as a result of the
ventricular interdependence mechanism, the
IVS shifts to the left, which reduces the
compliance, capacity and pump output of
the left ventricle.30 As a result of the
endothelium-dependent diastolic dysfunc-
tion, large amounts of endothelin and cat-
echolamine are generated, and this results in
increased blood pressure during sleep and
daytime hypertension.31 This increase in
blood pressure increases cardiac load and
LVMI, and causes ventricular hypertrophy,
cardiac remodelling and structural abnorm-
alities.32 All of these physiological changes
inevitably lead to myocardial systolic and
diastolic dysfunction.33,34
Tissue Doppler imaging technology has
been used to examine right ventricular func-
tion in patients with OSAHS, and it was
found that patients with OSAHS had differ-
ent degrees of right ventricular dysfunction
regardless of whether they had concomitant
hypertension or not.35,36 The TDI myocar-
dial performance indicator is one of the
most important indicators that reflect the
relationship between the degree of OSAHS
and right ventricular subclinical dysfunc-
tion.35,36 The study conducted by Ferrier
et al.37 in patients with OSAHS and left
ventricular dysfunction showed that, after
treatment, the LVEF returned to a normal
value, suggesting that OSAHS may cause
left ventricular systolic dysfunction during
the daytime. Therefore, improving sleep
apnoea can improve left ventricular systolic
function. The present study also found that
elderly patients with OSAHS showed sig-
nificant left ventricular diastolic dysfunc-
tion. The mitral inflow Em/Am was
significantly different between the OSAHS
group and the control group; so were the
mitral annulus Em, mitral annulus Em/Am,
LVPW Em, LVPW Am, LVPW Em/Am,
IVS Em, IVS Am and IVS Em/Am. These
findings suggested that OSAHS might cause
haemodynamic changes, increase afterload
and thicken the LVPW.
This present study found that there were
no significant differences between the two
indicators of left ventricular systolic func-
tion, CO and SV in OSAHS group and the
control group. However, there were statis-
tically significant differences for the indica-
tors FS and EF had between the two groups,
as well as for IVS Sm, mitral annulus Sm
and LVPW Sm. These findings indicated
that the myocardial systolic function of the
Sun et al. 401
patients with OSAHS was significantly
impaired. This finding was consistent
with that of a previous study that used
multigated radionuclide ventriculography to
measure EF.38
Obesity has been linked to specific car-
diovascular outcomes such as hypertension,
stroke, myocardial ischaemia and arrhyth-
mias, and it is also related to OSAHS.39 The
relationship between obesity, OSAHS and
heart disease has become an important area
of research. Animal research suggests that
forced inspiration-induced acute LA disten-
sion related to diastolic dysfunction may be
an important component of the arrhythmo-
genic substrate for atrial fibrillation during
sleep apnoea episodes in obese patients.40 In
the diseased cardiac patient, the severity of
obstructive sleep apnoea was associated
with an increased risk of death and risk
stratification based on obstructive sleep
apnoea severity was shown to be relevant.41
In this present study, obesity, as determined
by the BMI, in patients with OSAHS was
associated with more damage to the cardiac
structure and left ventricular diastolic and
systolic dysfunction than was observed in
the control patients with similar levels of
obesity.
There are some limitations to this study.
Because of insufficient follow-up time, we
were not able to observe the effects of long-
term continuous positive airway pressure
therapy or surgical treatment on cardiac
structure and function in patients with
OSAHS. Future studies should focus
on this.
In conclusion, this present study demon-
strated that the cardiac structure was altered
in elderly patients with OSAHS, which was
characterized by concentric hypertrophy,
while their left ventricular diastolic and sys-
tolic functions were significantly diminished
compared with control subjects. Obesity
appeared to participate in the damage to
the cardiac structure and left ventricular
diastolic and systolic dysfunction in patients
with OSAHS. Echocardiography, especially
TDI technology, might make the early
diagnosis of OSAHS in elderly patients
possible, which should help in the preven-
tion of future pathological changes to the
heart.
