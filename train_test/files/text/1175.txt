Objective: To investigate ecological correlates of the development of overweight in a multisite study sample of children
followed from age 2 to 12.
Design: Longitudinal examination of covariates of overweight status throughout childhood, with covariates drawn from three
ecological levels: sociocultural or demographic, quality of the child's home environment, and proximal child experience that
could directly affect the balance between energy intake and energy expenditure.
Subjects: A total of 960 children participating in a long-term longitudinal study provided growth data at least once; 653 of the
children had complete data on covariates.
Measurements: Height and weight measured seven times between ages 2 and 12 were converted to a body mass index (BMI)
and entered into a latent transition analysis to identify patterns of overweight across childhood. Ecological correlates measured
longitudinally included demographic characteristics obtained by maternal report, home environment quality obtained by
observation and maternal report, and proximal child experience factors obtained by observation, maternal report and child
report.
Results: Four patterns of overweight were found: never overweight, overweight beginning at preschool age, overweight
beginning in elementary school, and return to normal weight after being overweight at preschool age. The weight status groups
differed on home environment quality and proximal child experience factors but not on demographics. Children overweight at
preschool had less sensitive mothers than never overweight children. Children overweight at school age had fewer opportunities
for productive activity at home than did never overweight children. School-age overweight children also watched the most TV
after school. Multivariate logistic regression analyses further indicated the significance to children's weight status of proximal
child experience variables. Less physically active children and those who watched more television after school were more likely
to become overweight. Results did not vary by child sex.
Conclusion: The results support the idea that childhood overweight is multiply determined. The one potentially important and
changeable factor identified as a target for intervention centers on how children spend their time, especially their after-school
time. Children who are more physically active and spend less time watching TV after school are less likely to become overweight
by age 12.

Introduction
Concern over the rapid increase in childhood obesity in the
US has been widely expressed in the medical literature,1,2 the
social policy arena3,4 and the popular press.5,6 The rapidity
with which overweight has become a major health concern
suggests that the driving factors are environmental and
behavioral as well as genetic.1 A constellation of social

changes, including the rise in the use of preprepared and fast
food7,8 as well as soft drinks,7 the decline in everyday activity
such as walking to school,9 the extensive availability of
computers and videogames,10,11 and increased amount of
television viewing,12 has been linked to the increase in
obesity among children and youth. It is also known,
however, that family demographic factors such as ethnicity
and income are related to overweight in both children and
adults13 and that children who receive less positive parent-
ing are more likely to become overweight.14­16
The NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Devel-
opment (SECCYD) is one of very few longitudinal databases
available that allow examination of the large number of
demographic, family and environmental factors that have
been proposed as influences on the development of obesity
in children and adolescents. The children in the NICHD
SECCYD study cohort (n ¼ 1364), recruited from 10 different
locations across the country, were born in 1991. Thus, they
have grown up during a period of time that has been termed
an `obesity epidemic'17 when the prevalence of obesity in US
children has nearly tripled.13,18 Furthermore, growth data have
been collected on this cohort from birth through age 12, and
extensive observational and questionnaire data are available
to be examined as potential correlates of patterns of growth.
Therefore, this cohort provides us with an opportunity to
examine demographic, family and experiential correlates of
patterns of development of overweight over time.
Childhood obesity is defined by age, height and gender
percentile distributions that were developed during the 1970s,
well before the onset of increasing rates of obesity in US
children.19 According to the standards of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and terminology
proposed by the Institute of Medicine,2 children are considered
at risk for obesity if their body mass index (BMI) is equal to or
greater than the 85th percentile and obese if their BMI is equal
to or greater than the 95th percentile. Data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Studies (NHANES) from
the 1970s through 2002 show that the proportion of obese
children remained fairly stable at around 5% from the early
1970s to the mid-1980s but increased to nearly 10 to 15% from
1988 to 1994 and from 1999 to 2002.3
In the present study, we use an ecological framework based
on the model described by Sallis and Owen20 to investigate
correlates of overweight in childhood. From an ecological
perspective, health-related behavior is seen to be influenced
by factors operating concurrently at different levels: socio-
cultural, intra- and inter-personal and environmental. The
sociocultural level is represented in the present analyses by
demographic factors ­ family income, education levels,
ethnicity, family structure and child sex. The intra- and
inter-personal level is represented by aspects of the child's
home environment that are known to relate broadly to
overall well-being ­ maternal psychological health and
parenting quality. The environmental level is represented
by proximal factors in the child's past or current experience
that have the potential to link directly to the balance
between energy intake and energy expenditure ­ center-based
child care, level of physical activity, time spent watching
television, and the safety of the child's neighborhood.
By including all these aspects in a single study, it is possible
to examine the relative importance of each ecological level.
For example, sociocultural or demographic characteristics of
families that have been linked to childhood obesity may, in
fact, operate through family processes or through the day-
to-day experiences of children. It may also be that family
processes or environments that tend to lead to overweight in
one group of children ­ boys, for example ­ may not play the
same role for another group ­ in this case, girls.
The primary goal of the study was to examine links
between these three levels of ecological covariates and
patterns of growth indexed by BMI measured from age 2 to
age 12. Both prior research on the development of obesity21
and a previous report of children's growth in this study
cohort22 suggest that children who become overweight during
the preschool period are at particular risk for obesity through-
out childhood. Thus, we divided the total study sample into
overweight pattern groups based on the age at which children
moved above the 85% percentile cutoff for overweight and the
persistence of overweight after that time. We then examined
demographic characteristics of children and their families, the
quality of children's home environments, and more proximal
child experience factors expected to be related to energy
expenditure in order to identify variables that differentiated
these groups. Of particular interest from the viewpoint of
potential intervention approaches were comparisons between
children who never became overweight and children who did,
as these can suggest contextual factors that may help to
prevent weight gain in childhood.
Our hypotheses, based on prior literature, were: (a)
children from ethnic minority families, single-parent
families, and families with low education levels will be more
heavily represented in the overweight groups rather than the
always normal weight group; (b) with demographic factors
controlled, children whose mothers are less sensitive and
more strict and controlling and whose homes provide less
cognitive stimulation and opportunities for positive, pro-
ductive activity are more likely to become overweight; and
(c) proximal child experiences ­ especially those involving
more physical activity and less sedentary activity ­ are linked
to a lower likelihood of becoming overweight. To determine
whether covariates of weight status groups differed by
gender, we also examined interactions between child sex
and the parenting and proximal child experience factors.
Method
Participants
Participants for the study were recruited in 1991 from
designated hospitals at 10 data collection sites: Little Rock,
AR; Irvine, CA; Lawrence, KS; Boston, MA; Philadelphia and

Pittsburgh, PA; Charlottesville, VA; Seattle, WA; Hickory and
Morganton, NC; and Madison, WI. A total of 1364 families
with healthy newborns were enrolled. Recruitment and
selection procedures are described in detail in several
publications23 and on the study website (http://secc.rti.org).
Of the initial pool of 3015 eligible mothers contacted at 2
weeks for participation, 1364 (45%) completed the 1-month
home visit and became study participants. These 1364
families were very similar to the eligible hospital sample on
major demographic characteristics (years of maternal educa-
tion, ethnicity and presence of partner in home). The
resulting sample was diverse, including 24% ethnic minority
children (13% African American, 6% Hispanic, 2% Asian or
Native American, and 3% who reported Other), 11% mothers
who had not completed high school, and 14% single-parent
mothers. Mothers had an average of 14.4 years of education,
and 51.7% of the children were boys. Eligibility require-
ments specified that mothers be 18 years or older, English-
speaking, and not have known or acknowledged substance
abuse, and that infants not be hospitalized at birth for more
than 7 days nor have any obvious disabilities. This had the
effect of screening out very low birth weight, premature or
sick infants.
After 13 years of study, 1042 of the children (76.4%) have
been retained in the sample. In the analyses describing
longitudinal patterns of growth, 960 children who had
height and weight data at any point between 2 and 12 years
were included. The participants did not differ from those
not included (n ¼ 404) in child gender (w2 (1, 1364) ¼ 0.07,
P ¼ 0.080) or ethnicity (white vs nonwhite, w2 (1,
1364) ¼ 0.05, P ¼ 0.082), but were more likely to have two
parents in the home at the time of birth (w2 (1, 1364) ¼ 4.33,
P ¼ 0.004) and to have mothers with more education (F (1,
1362) ¼ 6.82, P ¼ 0.001). The analyses of covariates of weight
patterns include 653 children with complete data on all
variables; these participants did not differ from those in the
earlier analyses in child sex (w2 (1, 960) ¼ 1.56, P ¼ 0.021, but
were more likely to be white (w2 (1, 960) ¼ 14.17, Po0.001),
to be from two-parent families (w2 (1, 960) ¼ 15.68,
Po0.001), and to have mothers with more education (w2
(1, 960) ¼ 10.52, P ¼ 0.0001).
Overview of data collection
Children at 10 different geographic sites were followed from
birth to sixth grade. Mothers were interviewed at home
when infants were 1 month-old. When children were 6, 15,
24, 36 and 54 months old and in first, third and fifth grade,
we assessed the home and family environment, and begin-
ning at 15 months we also brought children to the lab where
measures of height and weight were collected along with
other observational and questionnaire measures. At each age
before school entry, we observed children's child care
environments and obtained data on their hours in non-
maternal care, and in grades 1, 3 and 5 we observed children
at school. When children were in grades 3, 5 and 6, their
physical activity was monitored for 1 week. Complete
descriptions of the data collection procedures used can be
found in the Manuals of Operation for the NICHD Study of
Early Child Care, which are available at http://secc.rti.org.
Measures
Height and weight. Standardized procedures were used to
measure height and weight at 24, 36 and 54 months, and
when children were in first, third, fifth and sixth grades.
Height was measured with children standing with shoes off,
feet together, and their backs to a calibrated 7-foot measur-
ing stick fastened to a wall. Height was measured to the
nearest 1/8 inch (0.32 cm) and recorded two times. If the
first two height measures differed by more than 1/4 inch
(0.64 cm), two more height measurements were taken.
Weight was measured using a physician's two-beam scale.
Scales were calibrated monthly using certified calibration
weights. Weight was measured with children in minimal
clothing (i.e., no shoes, no outer layers of clothing and other
items that could add weight such as belts, keys or watches).
As with height, weight was measured twice, each time to the
nearest 1/4 pound (0.1 kg). If the two weight measurements
differed by more than 4 ounces, two more measurements
were taken. BMI was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by
height (m) squared.
Demographic characteristics. Child gender and ethnicity
were recorded at 1 month. In this study, ethnicity was
recoded as white/nonwhite because the numbers within
individual ethnic minority groups were not large enough to
allow analyses of the groups separately. Maternal education
in years was obtained by interview at 1 month. Family
income was reported by mothers at each major data
collection time point, and an income-to-needs ratio was
calculated by dividing income by the poverty level for that
family size. The average family income-to-needs ratio from
6 months after the child's birth through either 54 months
or sixth grade was used in analyses. Partner status (resident
husband or partner vs no resident partner) was obtained by
maternal interview during telephone calls or in-person
interviews at every age; the proportion of times the child
was living in a two-parent home was used in analyses.
Home environment characteristics. The quality of children's
home environments was indexed by maternal psychological
well-being and observed and reported parenting practices.
Mean scores across relevant time periods were used in
analyses.
Maternal depression Maternal depressive symptoms were
measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies ­
Depression Scale (CES-D)24 at 6, 15, 24, 36 and 54 months
and at first, third, fifth and sixth grades. The CES-D provides
an index of depressive symptoms and is appropriate for use
in a nonclinical population (a ranged from 0.90 to 0.91).

Correlations across adjacent time points ranged from 0.46 to
0.58.
Opportunities for productive activity A subset of items from
the Home Observation for the Measurement of the Environ-
ment (HOME) Inventory25 were used at 6, 15, 36 and 54
months and in third and fifth grades to measure the quality
of the home environment in terms of the opportunities
provided for children to be engaged with and learn from
their environment. Items included the availability to the
child of books, games and sports equipment and whether the
child has been to a museum, a performance or a sports event
in the last year. The HOME Inventory is an observational and
interview measure that captures a picture of the child's
experiences at home. Observers were trained and certified
on the use of the measure by experienced interviewers at
one site. The subscale included 20 items at 6 and 15 months,
a ¼ 0.67 at 6 months and 0.73 at 15 months; 23 items at 36
and 54 months, a ¼ 0.82 at 36 months and 0.73 at 54
months; 21 items at grade 3, a ¼ 0.72; and 18 items at grade
5, a ¼ 0.77.
Maternal sensitivity Mother­child interaction was video-
taped in semistructured 15-min observations using age-
appropriate toys and activities at 6, 15, 24, 36 and 54
months and at first, third and fifth grades.26 Videotapes were
coded by raters who were unaware of other information
about the families. Inter-coder reliability was determined by
independent coding of 20% of the tapes at each assessment
period. Inter-coder reliability was calculated as the intraclass
correlation27 and ranged from 0.84 to 0.91 for the maternal
sensitivity ratings used in the present study. A maternal
sensitivity composite variable was constructed at each age.
At 6, 15 and 24 months, maternal sensitivity was calculated
as the sum of four-point ratings of sensitivity to non-distress,
positive regard and intrusiveness (reversed). At 36 and 54
months and at first, third and fifth grade, seven-point ratings
of supportive presence, respect for autonomy and hostility
(reversed) were combined (a40.70 at every age). Total scores
were transformed into z-scores for analysis. Correlations
across adjacent time points ranged from 0.40 to 0.51.
Controlling parenting At 54 months and again at first and
third grade, mothers completed the Raising Children Check-
list,28 which assesses three types of parenting strategies
controlling, responsive and lax. Only the controlling-
parenting score is used in this report. The items in this scale
include indicators of parental expectations for obedience
and respect for parental authority (`Do you expect your child
to obey the first time you say something?'). At 54 months
and first grade, the scores were the mean of responses to six
items on the questionnaire, with higher scores reflecting
greater parental control. Internal reliability (Cronbach's a)
was 0.71 at 54 months and 0.69 at first grade. At third grade,
the measure was the mean of responses to nine items,
proportionally weighted and somewhat overlapping with
items included at earlier ages (Cronbach's a ¼ 0.075). Corre-
lations across time ranged from 0.68 to 0.75.
Proximal child experience factors. Characteristics of the
children's experiences that could potentially directly affect
the balance between energy intake and energy expenditure
included type of child care, reported and measured activity,
time spent in active and sedentary pursuits, and neighbor-
hood safety. When measures were administered at more than
one time point, the mean across time was used in analyses.
Child care history Almost all the children in the sample
experienced some non-parental child care before starting
school. Because center-based child care is the type of care
that is most different from at-home care, and because it is
likely that larger groups of children are more active than
children playing alone or in dyads, we used the proportion
of time children spent in center-based care to examine the
potential relation between child care experience and the
development of obesity. At 3- to 6-month intervals from 6 to
54 months, mothers were asked about the type of child care
their child was receiving. The proportion of time points (out
of 16) the mother reported the child to be attending center-
based care was used in analyses.
Reported activity level in the preschool period At 54 months,
mothers completed a reduced version of the Child Behavior
Questionnaire,29 a parent-report measure of child tempera-
ment. The 10-item activity level subscale (Cronbach's
a ¼ 0.070) was used in this study; higher scores indicate
higher levels of gross motor activity.
Monitored physical activity The amount of physical activity
each child engaged in across a typical week was measured
when the children were in third, fifth and sixth grades using
an accelerometer (Computer Science Application ­ The CSA
accelerometer Computer Science and Applications, Inc.,
Shalimar, FL, USA) that provides a continuous recording of
minute-by-minute movement counts. Participants were
asked to wear the monitor on a belt around the waist during
waking hours for 7 days, including both two weekends and
five weekdays, excluding showering, bathing, water sports or
contact sports, in order to obtain as reliable an estimate of
usual physical activity as possible. Following earlier research
on monitored physical activity,30 the index of activity used
in the present study was the mean percentage of time
children spent in moderate or vigorous physical activity
(MVPA). Correlations across time points ranged from 0.35 to
0.52.
Time in school physical education classes At third, fourth,
fifth and sixth grades, teachers were asked to report the
weekly minutes children spent in physical education (PE)
classes. Correlations across grades ranged from 0.14 to 0.51.

After-school activities At third, fourth and fifth grades
children were interviewed by phone using a guided recall
format31 to describe their activities from school dismissal
until 1800 in 15-min intervals. Data were scaled to 12
intervals per interview to obtain comparable time estimates
for all children. From these interviews, the number of after-
school intervals children spent engaged in physical activities
or sports was obtained. Interviewer reliability was assessed
by calculating agreement between interviewers and a master
coder for audiotaped interviews; agreement on coding
categories for children's activities ranged from 91 to 100%.
Correlations across time points ranged from 0.17 to 0.23.
Television watching Two different measures of children's
time spent watching television were used. At 36 months,
mothers completed a Television Viewing Questionnaire
developed for this study in which they estimated the amount
of time children were awake and in a room where the
television was turned on for two weekdays and both
weekend days in a typical week. The average for the two
weekdays was multiplied by 3 and added to the total
reported time to obtain a measure of the hours per week a
child was exposed to television. At third, fourth and fifth
grades the after-school activities interview (described above)
was used to obtain the child's own report of television
watching after school. Correlations of the number of
intervals spent watching TV across time points ranged from
0.24 to 0.30.
Neighborhood safety At first, third and fifth grades,
mothers completed the Neighborhood Questionnaire32 in-
cluding five items describing their perceptions of the safety
of the neighborhood in which the family lived. Cronbach's a
values were 0.74 at first grade, 0.76 at third grade and 0.77 at
fifth grade. Correlations ranged from 0.57 to 0.68.
Analyses
Latent transition analysis (LTA)33,34 was used to define
patterns of moving into and out of overweight status
(BMIX85%) between ages 2 and 12 years. After groups were
created, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was
used to examine differences across all four groups, and a
series of logistic regression analyses were conducted to
identify covariates from three levels of analysis ­ demo-
graphic characteristics, quality of parenting, and proximal
environmental factors ­ that discriminated between specific
weight status groups.
Results
Patterns of overweight
The proportion of the sample that was overweight
(BMI485%) increased with child age. At 24 months, approxi-
mately 15% of the sample was considered overweight; this
percentage increased to 18% at 36 months, 25% at 54
months, 26% at first grade, 31% at third grade and 34%
at fifth and sixth grades.
For the LTA defining groups based on patterns of the
development of overweight, children who had data at any of
the data collection points (n ¼ 960) were included, and the
analysis controlled for whether or not children had entered
puberty at age 11 or 12. This analysis initially resulted in
30 groups varying in size from 1 to 573. These groups were
further collapsed by age periods to create five groups: (a) the
`never overweight' group (n ¼ 573, 59.7%) had BMIs o85%
at all ages; (b) the `preschool overweight' group (n ¼ 183,
19.1%) became overweight at 24, 36 or 54 months of age and
remained overweight; (c) the `elementary overweight' group
(n ¼ 98, 10.2%) became overweight after age 54 months
and remained overweight; (d) the `return to normal weight'
group (n ¼ 71, 7.4%) experienced at least one overweight
period between 24 and 54 months, but then returned to a
normal weight status and remained so for at least three
measurement periods; and (e) the `variable' group (n ¼ 35,
3.6%) moved between normal and overweight status in
no discernable pattern. These `variable' children were not
included in any additional analyses.
Before conducting analyses to address the key questions
of interest, we examined whether there were differences in
weight status group membership as a function of data
collection site and child sex. No differences were found,
and therefore analyses include both boys and girls.
Descriptive data on group differences
Means for demographic characteristics, home environment
variables and proximal child experience factors by weight
status group are shown in Table 1. Multivariate analysis of
each set of variables showed significant weight status group
differences for home environment variables (F (12,
1944) ¼ 2.23, P ¼ 0.009) and proximal child experience
factors (F (24, 1932) ¼ 1.57, P ¼ 0.04), but not for demo-
graphics.
Within the set of home environment variables, univariate
analyses indicated that both the Opportunities for Produc-
tive Activity subscale from the HOME (F (3, 653) ¼ 3.78,
P ¼ 0.01) and maternal sensitivity (F (3, 653) ¼ 4.47,
P ¼ 0.004) differed significantly by group. Children who first
became overweight in elementary school had fewer oppor-
tunities for productive activity at home than did children
who were never overweight, and children who first became
overweight at preschool age and remained overweight
thereafter had less sensitive mothers than the children who
were never overweight. There were no group differences
in maternal depressive symptoms or mothers' reported con-
trolling parenting. Within the set of child experience factors
thought to have relatively direct effects on children's weight,
only time spent watching television after school significantly
differed by weight status group (F (3, 653) ¼ 4.74, P ¼ 0.003).
Children who became overweight in elementary school

watched more TV during their after-school time than the
children who never became overweight.
Differentiating weight status groups
Logistic regression analyses were used for multivariate
examination of covariates in three planned comparisons:
never vs ever overweight, never vs elementary overweight
and never vs preschool overweight. (The return to normal
and variable groups were too small to be included in these
analyses.) For each comparison, hierarchical models were
tested in which demographic characteristics were entered in
the first block, home environment variables in the second
block, and proximal child experience factors in the third
block. To determine whether covariates of overweight group
status differed for boys and girls in the sample, we
also entered interactions between child sex and each of the
home environment and child experience covariates. Of
the 36 interactions tested, only two were significant
(Po0.05) and one was marginally significant (Po0.10), and
these few interactions reflected no consistent pattern. Given
the low frequency of significant results relative to the
number of tests run, the interactions were not interpreted
further. Results of the logistic regression analyses are shown
in Tables 2 and 3.
Never overweight vs ever overweight Results of the analysis
comparing children who were never overweight vs those
who became overweight at any point and remained so until
age 12 indicated that the block of proximal child experience
variables significantly differentiated the groups above and
beyond demographic characteristics and home environment
factors. As shown in Table 2, the amount of physical activity
children engaged in and the time they spent watching
television after school were the factors that differentiated the
children who became overweight at any point from those
who did not. Children who were more active between third
and sixth grade were more likely to be in the `never
overweight' weight status group, whereas children who
watched more TV after school between third and sixth grade
were more likely to be in the `overweight' group. The full
model accounted for approximately 6% of the total variance.
Never overweight vs elementary overweight Results of the
analysis comparing children who were never overweight
with those who first became overweight in the elementary
school years (Table 2) showed a marginally significant effect
for the block of variables representing the home environ-
ment. Within that block, maternal reports of controlling
parenting practices differentiated the children who became
overweight from those who did not. For every one-
point increase in mothers' reported controlling parenting,
children were 2.6 times more likely to become overweight.
The block of proximal child experience variables also
significantly differentiated these groups. Child-reported TV
watching after school was the single factor that most clearly
separated the groups, with children watching more TV being
significantly more likely to be in the overweight group.

The full model accounted for approximately 7% of the total
variance.
Never overweight vs preschool overweight The analysis
comparing the never overweight children with those who
became overweight during the preschool period and
remained overweight examined only the contextual factors
measured during the preschool period (Table 3). None of the
covariate blocks contributed significantly to differentiating
the groups, and the overall model accounted for only 3% of
the total variance.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to examine, concurrently, a
range of ecologically relevant factors that have been
proposed to relate to excessive weight gain in childhood.
The longitudinal nature of the data available allowed us
to make comparisons across four groups of children: those
who were never overweight up to age 12, those who became
overweight during the preschool years and remained so to
age 12, those who first became overweight in the elementary
school years, and those who were overweight before school
age but returned to normal weight thereafter.
When these four groups were compared on demographic,
home environment, and proximal child experience factors,
home environment and proximal child experience factors
both differentiated the groups. Follow-up univariate tests
indicated that children who first became overweight in
preschool differed from the never overweight group in the
amount of sensitivity their mothers showed in interaction
with them. Observed sensitivity in interaction with the child
may be a marker for mothers who are also more involved
with their preschool-age children, engage in activities with
them, and eat meals together as a family, thus promoting
children's overall health and well-being. Sensitivity may
also be a characteristic of mothers who are more attuned to
children's nutritional needs and more likely to provide a
healthful diet during the preschool period, when children
are not yet selecting their own snack foods.
Children who first became overweight during the elemen-
tary school years differed from other groups in two respects.
Their home environments provided fewer opportunities for
productive activity than the `never overweight' group, and
they spent more of their after-school time watching
television. These findings suggest the possibility of a pattern
in which children who have few toys or adult-structured
activities to engage them at home tend to rely on television
to fill their time, and such a pattern would be highly likely to
result in an overweight child.
The fact that the groups did not differ on demographic
variables contrasts with other research on childhood over-
weight,3 indicating that family background characteristics
such as ethnicity and income tend to be linked to overweight

status. Perhaps childhood overweight has become more
pervasive and now affects all social classes. Further research
is needed to examine the distribution of overweight
in children nationally and temporal changes in that
distribution.
The overweight groups were also compared with the never
overweight group using logistic regression analyses that
allowed a multivariate approach. Although the factors
examined in these analyses are those highlighted by many
other researchers as important in the development of
childhood obesity,33,35,36 we did not find that the full model
accounted for much of the variance between groups. Some
sets of variables appeared to be more important in differ-
entiating certain groups. Proximal child experience factors ­
especially activity and TV watching ­ reliably differentiated
children who were never overweight from those who became
overweight at some point before age 12. It is not surprising to
find that children who are more active and who watch less
television are also less likely to be overweight; however, prior
results examining these factors have not yielded consistent
findings.3 Thus, these results add to the growing literature
supporting a focus on the balance between active and
sedentary pursuits in interventions designed to prevent
overweight in childhood (e.g., 37,38).
By contrast, the quality of the child's home environment,
particularly the presence of controlling parents, differen-
tiated the children who became overweight in elementary
school from those who did not. In an earlier study using the
NICHD SECCYD data set, Rhee et al.39 reported a link
between parenting style in the preschool years and child
overweight status at first grade. Mothers who were highly
sensitive and who held high expectations for child self-
control were least likely to have overweight children 2 years
later. These earlier findings, specific to the preschool-first
grade period, show results similar to those found in the
present study across a longer time frame. The results of both
studies indicate the need for more research into family
processes associated with childhood obesity.
One strength of the present study is the wide range of
ecologically relevant variables studied over time in terms of
family, school and after-school characteristics. The study is
unique in that it includes children from 10 locations around
the US growing up in the early 1990s, at the beginning of the
rise in childhood obesity. In addition, the findings are based
on longitudinal data, with height and weight measured
frequently across the children's first 12 years. The limitations
of the study include the fact that ethnic minority groups are
not well enough represented in the sample to allow separate
analyses for African American or Hispanic children. Sec-
ondly, although growth was thoroughly studied, no other
anthropometric measures of adiposity, such as skin-fold
measurements or waist circumference, were obtained at all
data points. As BMI does not directly measure body fat, it is
recognized as a practical surrogate for adiposity.40 We did not
have access to parental weight data or to dietary intake of the
children; thus, neither genetic factors nor the role of energy
intake could be examined. Finally, the measure of physical
activity excluded periods of time when children participated
in highly active sports or swimming and therefore under-
estimated activity in some children.
The results of this study support the idea that overweight
is multiply determined. We did not find one single factor
that was consistently linked to overweight status. This result
is not surprising given the many societal and life-style
changes that have occurred during the period of increasing
obesity in the US population. The present study is correla-
tional in nature and therefore the factors identified as related
to overweight cannot be interpreted as causal. The results

do suggest one potentially important and changeable factor
that might usefully be examined in further research using
intervention approaches: how children spend their time,
especially their after-school time. Children who were more
physically active and spent less time watching TV after
school were less likely to be overweight by age 12. From our
results, it is not possible to determine the direction of this
effect; overweight children may prefer more sedentary
activity. Still, these findings suggest that parents might
consider the nature of the after-school arrangements they
make for their children and select those that emphasize
active play and exercise rather than sedentary activity.
Furthermore, educators and recreation specialists who
organize and manage after-school programs might take note
of these results in selecting activities.
It is clear from the patterns of overweight among children
in this sample that intervention to prevent obesity needs to
begin early. More than twice as many overweight preschoo-
lers remained in that category until age 12 as returned to
normal weight once they reached school age. These findings
support and extend those from an earlier study with this
same sample showing that the risk of overweight at age 12
was increased fivefold for children who attained the 85th
percentile for BMI during the preschool period compared to
children who never crossed into the `at-risk' BMI category
in preschool.22 Even though effect sizes of the covariates
studied are relatively small, these small effects, noted among
families who were not selected because of their involvement
in intervention programs, suggest that the contextual
factors examined here may be contributing to a population
shift in body weight. Professionals and parents who are
aware of the likely persistence of overweight from early
childhood onward would do well to take steps to reduce
energy intake and increase energy output in all young
children, and especially when children show disproportional
gains in weight. Efforts to keep children's weight within
normal limits need to be maintained throughout children's
growing years.
