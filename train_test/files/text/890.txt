This article presents a demographic profile of grandparents, using the National Survey of
Families and Households. Specific dimensions of grandparenthood addressed include
grandparents' survival, the timing of grandparenthood, grandparents' involvement in other
roles, surrogate parenting, and stepgrandparents. The data indicate considerable
heterogeneity among grandparents of different genders and races or ethnicities. They also
suggest modifications in previous descriptions of modern grandparenthood.

Grandparents Today: A Demographic Profile1
Maximiliane E. Szinovacz, PhD2
Several researchers contend that demographic and
social changes have significantly altered the experi-
ence of grandparenthood during this century (Cher-
lin & Furstenberg, 1986; George & Gold, 1991; Hages-
tad, 1988; Wilk, 1993). However, evidence for this
assertion is limited. Past studies either refer to gen-
eral population trends (census) among the elderly or
rely on mostly small or nonrepresentative samples of
grandparents (Aldous, 1995; Robertson, 1995). Esti-
mates based on census data are questionable for sev-
eral reasons. First, grandparenthood constitutes a
countertransition; that is, a transition determined not
only by the grandparent's own characteristics and
life choices but also by those of his or her children
and grandchildren (Hagestad, 1988; Sprey & Mat-
thews, 1982; Troll, 1985). Consequently, trends in the
experience of grandparenthood reflect not only pop-
ulation trends in at least two generations but also be-
havioral dispositions within families. For example,
age of transition to grandparenthood is contingent
on the timing of births among the grandparents as
well as their children, and specific fertility patterns
such as teenage pregnancy are known to recur
within families over several generations. Trends in
grandparenthood thus reflect complex generational
and intrafamilial behavior patterns, which are diffi-
cult to capture with census data. Furthermore, the
onset of grandparenthood varies considerably. Thus,
specific characteristics of grandparents, such as their
involvement in other roles, cannot be derived from
data on specific age groups. Also, census reports on
surrogate parenting are limited to "current" house-

holds among the population at large, leading to po-
tential underestimates of this phenomenon.
Studies on grandparents, on the other hand, rarely
provide generalizable data. Even the few large-scale
investigations of grandparenthood performed during
the past decade are not truly representative. For
example, both Cherlin and Furstenberg (1986) and
King and Elder's (1995) studies focused exclusively on
grandparents of teenagers or adolescents, and
Bengtson and Harootyan (1994) referred only to
grandparents of adult grandchildren. Much of the
grandparent research further contains a gender
and/or race basis: Studies often neglect grandfathers
and address only specific racial/ethnic groups. In ad-
dition, both census estimates and grandparent stud-
ies often fail to consider that selected grandparent
characteristics (e.g., survival or involvement in other
roles) vary for different grandchildren. For instance,
grandparents may survive well into the adulthood of
their first-born but not their last-born grandchild.
Because of these limitations, we lack even a basic
demographic characterization of grandparents in
general and of specific aspects of current grandpar-
enthood (e.g., timing, divorce, household composi-
tion) in particular. As Aldous (1995) noted, such infor-
mation is essential to assess grandparents' ability to
provide support when needed, to estimate the po-
tential of multiple care needs in families (e.g., frail
grandparents and great-grandparents), or to deter-
mine the prevalence of disrupted grandparent-
grandchild relations due to divorce. Demographic in-
formation on grandparents also is sought by market
researchers as grandparents constitute an important
and growing target for businesses selling merchan-
dise for children and adolescents (Schlosberg, 1990;
Schwartz & Waldrop, 1992).
The purpose of this article is to provide a nation-
ally representative demographic profile of grand-
parents that addresses some of the most important
characteristics of current grandparenthood, namely,
prevalence, survival, timing, divorce, surrogate par-
enting, and grandparents' other roles. Demographic
trends in grandparenthood identified in earlier stud-

ies are presented first and then contrasted with data
on current grandparents from a nationally represen-
tative survey, the National Survey of Families and
Households (NSFH). Whenever sample size permits,
these data are presented by gender and race, thus
paying tribute to the heterogeneity among today's
grandparents. A detailed discussion of grandpar-
ent-grandchild relationships would go beyond the
demographic emphasis of this article.
Literature Review
Prevalence, Survival, and Timing
How many individuals eventually experience grand-
parenthood depends on longevity and their own and
their children's fertility and timing of parenthood.
Life expectancy--both at birth and at typical child-
bearing age --increased dramatically during this cen-
tury (Watkins, Menken, & Bongaarts, 1987). Most in-
dividuals in industrialized societies now survive well
beyond the usual age of becoming a grandparent;
that is, their 40s or 50s (Cherlin & Furstenberg, 1986;
Uhlenberg, 1980, 1996), and a considerable number
survive to become great-grandparents (Farkas &
Hogan, 1995). Thus, both the likelihood of surviving
to grandparenthood and the duration of grandpar-
enthood increased during this century (Cherlin &
Furstenberg, 1986; Hagestad & Burton, 1986). This im-
plies that most of today's grandchildren will have all
or most of their grandparents survive at least during
part of their childhood and adolescence, and many
will have surviving grandparents well into their adult
years. Uhlenberg (1996) estimated, for example, that
by the year 2000 over one third of grandchildren will
have all of their grandparents survive to age 10, and
that three quarters will have at least one surviving
grandparent at age 30.
Estimates of fertility for two successive generations
are not readily available. Uhlenberg and Kirby (in
press) estimated that the peak fertility during the
baby boom will lead to particularly low rates of
grandchildlessness during the last two decades of
this century, whereas declining fertility for more re-
cent cohorts is likely to result in increased propor-
tions of grandchildless individuals after the turn of
this century.
Median age of first parenthood underwent only
relatively minor changes during this century.
Stevens' (1990) estimates from census data indicated
that except for the baby boom period (when median
age at first parenthood was 21-22 years), women's
median age at the birth of their first child remained
relatively stable between 23-24 years from 1890 to
1980. However, both the relatively large number of
teenage births in the later part of this century and the
more recent simultaneous trend toward delayed par-
enthood (Bumpass, 1990; George & Cold, 1991) are
likely to result in greater heterogeneity in the onset
and duration of grandparenthood.
How many and how long their grandparents sur-
vive also is contingent on grandchildren's birth order
as well as on the birth order of their parents. Obvi-
ously, first-born children of first-born parents will
enjoy surviving grandparents longer than children of
any other birth order combination. Due primarily to
the sharp decline in number of births per woman
during this century (with some increases during the
baby boom), the interval between first and last births
is now much smaller than it was at the beginning of
the century (Spanier & Click, 1980), so that differ-
ences in grandparents' survival between first-born
and last-born grandchildren are minimized.
The reduction in fertility and in the interval be-
tween first and last births during this century led
some researchers to assert that today's grandparents
will have launched their own children by the time
they become grandparents; that is, active parent-
hood (children under 18 in the household) and
grandparenthood are seen as sequential rather than
overlapping life phases (Hagestad, 1988; Hagestad &
Burton, 1986). The only exception to this trend is
noted for parents of teenage parents and associated
with perceptions of "off-time" grandparenthood
(Burton, 1987).
Increased life expectancy and reduced fertility led
to the characterization of today's families as bean-
pole families, a term reflecting the expanding ver-
tical and declining horizontal extension of families
(Bengtson, Rosenthal, & Burton, 1990; George &
Cold, 1991). The validity of this characterization for
today's and future families remains debated (Farkas
& Hogan, 1995; Treas, 1995; Uhlenberg, 1995). Where-
as more individuals than in the past may survive to
great-grandparenthood, the duration of great-grand-
parenthood and the prevalence of four-generation
families is not known. Also, grandparents of the baby
boom cohorts will have several siblings and cousins
throughout most of their lives.
Although increases in life expectancy during this
century cut across all population groups, pronounced
gender and racial or ethnic differences in life ex-
pectancy remain (Markides & Black, 1995; Moen,
1995). The gender gap in life expectancy increased
during this century, leading to sometimes pro-
nounced discrepancies in the survival of grandmoth-
ers and grandfathers (Baranowski, 1985; Kinsella,
1995). The effects of continued lower life expectancy
among racial or ethnic minorities, on the other hand,
may be partially offset by earlier childbearing among
these groups (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1990). In
addition, age differences between spouses often
lead to discrepancies in the survival of maternal and
paternal grandparents. Age heterogeneity between
spouses declined during this century from about 4
years in 1900 to 2 years in 1993 (Saluter, 1994). Be-
cause two generations are involved, this means that
age differences between maternal grandmothers and
paternal grandfathers will have declined on average
from 8 to 4 years since the beginning of this century.
Also, large age differences between spouses (10
years or more) were much more common at the be-
ginning of this century than they are today, as were
marriages in which husbands were younger than
their wives (Atkinson & Glass, 1985). Consequently,
today's grandchildren will be more likely than grand-
38 The Gerontologist
children in the past to have grandparents who are
similar in age and less likely to have grandfathers
who are younger than grandmothers or who survive
grandmothers.
Overall, this research implies that today's grand-
parents will spend several decades as grandparents
and will share their role as grandparents with other
grandparents (both their own spouse and the grand-
parents from the other lineage). Similarly, grandchil-
dren will have more surviving grandparents and will
have grandparents who survive for a longer time.
Trends in fertility and the timing of marriage and par-
enthood further suggest greater homogeneity in
grandparents' ages and in siblings' access to grand-
parents and a separation of parent and grandparent
roles during the life course. Declines in fertility cou-
pled with increased life expectancy are likely to lead
to increased verticalization of families. However,
teenage births and delays of parenthood in recent
cohorts, as well as gender and racial or ethnic differ-
ences in life expectancy, will account for some het-
erogeneity both in the onset and duration of grand-
parenthood among diverse population groups.
Grandparenthood and Life Course Transitions
Changes in the timing and duration of grandpar-
enthood have important implications not only for the
experience of grandparenthood itself but also for its
intersection with other life events and transitions,
both grandparents' and grandchildren's. As several
authors note (Hagestad & Burton, 1986; Troll, 1985),
grandparent-grandchild relationships are at least
partially contingent on grandparents' and grandchil-
dren's roles in other life spheres (e.g., marriage, par-
enthood, labor force participation) and on the se-
quencing of life transitions in each of these domains.
Generally, the onset of grandparenthood occurs in
midlife when involvement in other roles is at its peak
(Adelmann, 1994; Hagestad, 1988). Consideration of
intersecting life transitions has become increasingly
important with the prolonged duration of grandpar-
enthood (i.e., both grandparents and grandchildren
will undergo more life transitions as the duration
of grandparenthood and the number of surviving
grandparents increase).
As far as marriage is concerned, several fundamen-
tal changes in sequencing occurred during this cen-
tury. Increases in longevity most likely led to a rever-
sal in the timing of grandparenthood and
widow(er)hood. Whereas early in this century wid-
owhood often preceded the launching of the last
child or occurred shortly thereafter, today's parents
typically enjoy a lengthy empty-nest period together
before one partner dies (Spanier & Click, 1980; Uh-
lenberg, 1980). Thus, today's grandparents are likely
to experience the death of their partner well after
they become grandparents. Recent delays in parent-
hood are likely to decrease the interval between
grandparenthood and widowhood but unlikely to
fully reverse this trend.
However, the postponement of widowhood into
later life does not necessarily mean that today's
grandparents will be significantly more likely to be
married (and especially married to each other) than
grandparents in the past. Rising divorce rates during
this century and the gender differences in remar-
riage (Bumpass, 1990) suggest that more grandmoth-
ers will enter grandparenthood as divorcees and
more grandparents of either sex will be married to
partners other than the grandchildren's biological
grandparents.
In addition, more grandparents than in the past
will experience the occurrence of divorce and step-
families among their adult children. Glick (1989) esti-
mated that close to one quarter of all children under
18 live with single parents and an additional 14% live
with stepparents. Because stepgrandparenthood re-
sults from both grandparents' and their adult chil-
dren's divorces, the proportion of stepgrandparents
most likely exceeds the proportion of divorcees with
children in either generation.
Changes in labor force participation during this
century also have major implications for the experi-
ence of grandparenthood. Three trends are particu-
larly significant; namely, the increased labor force
participation of women (including women in their
40s and 50s), the institutionalization of retirement,
and the decline in retirement age (Szinovacz & Ek-
erdt, 1995). The increased labor force participation
among middle-aged women implies that many of
today's grandmothers will be employed (especially
when their grandchildren are still relatively young)
and thus less available to care for grandchildren dur-
ing work hours. The institutionalization of retirement
and reduction in retirement age mean, first, that
grandfathers will be more available for their grand-
children. During the first half of this century many
men either did not retire at all (i.e., death occurred at
a time when they were still in the labor force) or sur-
vived their retirement by only a short time, often ill
or frail (Atchley, 1976; Haber & Gratton, 1994). The
implementation of Social Security and pension plans
as well as economic pressures led to a steady decline
in men's retirement age at least since the 1950s (Szi-
novacz & Ekerdt, 1995). Thus, a larger proportion of
today's men will spend close to a decade as grandfa-
thers and retirees. Similarly, few women are em-
ployed beyond their mid-60s and many leave the
labor force in their early 60s or even in their late 50s
(Szinovacz & Ekerdt, 1995). Thus, grandmothers of
older children are unlikely to be in the labor force,
but in contrast to grandmothers in the past they are
more likely to be retirees rather than long-term
housewives.
In general, then, today's grandparents are not nec-
essarily occupying more roles than grandparents in
the past (e.g., grandmothers are more likely to be
employed but less likely to be active parents). Rather,
they are prone to undergo more life transitions dur-
ing grandparenthood. In addition, the rising divorce
rate during this century has contributed to increas-
ingly complex family structures. It also implies that
grandparent-grandchild relationships can be dis-
rupted not only by death but also by divorce in
either the parents' or the grandparents' generation.

Household Extension and Surrogate Parenting
In assessing trends in household extension, it is
important to distinguish between upward and down-
ward extension; that is, whether adult children take
in their parent(s) (upward extension) or whether
adult children and their children reside in their par-
ents' household (downward extension), and whether
both, one, or neither of the grandchildren's parents
live in the household (Burton, Dilworth-Anderson, &
Merriwether-deVries, 1995; Gratton, 1987; Szinovacz,
1996). The distinction between upward and down-
ward extension typically (though not always) indi-
cates whether the extended household is maintained
to serve the grandparents' or the adult children's and
the grandchildren's needs (Aquilino, 1990; Lee &
Dwyer, 1996; Szinovacz, 1996). The presence of grand-
children's parent(s) offers rough estimates concern-
ing grandparents' responsibility for the grandchil-
dren (i.e., whether they have full responsibility for
the grandchildren or function more as co-parents or
helpers to the grandchildren's own parents).
Some evidence concerning trends in extended
households and surrogate parenting is available from
census data. The proportion of grandchildren core-
siding with grandparents (in both upward and down-
ward extended households) increased slightly be-
tween 1940 (10.3% White, 16.0% Black) and 1950
(10.6% White, 18.5% Black), then it declined steadily
until 1980 (4.8% White and 12.2% Black) and rose
slightly in the 1990s (5.3% White, 14.9% Black; Her-
nandez & Myers, 1993; Uhlenberg & Kirby, in press).
This general pattern varies by family structure and
race. The strongest decline in coresidence with
grandparents since the middle of this century oc-
curred among two parent families suggesting that
traditional extended households (children remaining
in parents' household after their marriage and par-
enthood) and/or adult children taking elderly parents
into their homes are becoming increasingly rare
(Hernandez & Myers, 1993; Uhlenberg & Kirby, in
press). This conclusion is supported by other census
analyses, which indicate a decline since mid-century
in the proportion of elderly parents living with their
adult children (Ruggles, 1994; Saluter, 1992). In con-
trast, the proportion of White grandchildren living
with single or no parents and grandparents declined
slightly from 1940 to 1970 (3.1% to 2.1%) and then
rose to 2.5% in 1980 (Hernandez & Myers, 1993).
Among Blacks, the proportion of grandchildren liv-
ing with neither parent and grandparents declined
from 7.6% in 1940 to 4.8% in 1980, whereas the pro-
portion of grandchildren living with single parents
and grandparents increased from 3.1% to 5.7% dur-
ing the same time period (Hernandez & Myers, 1993).
Additional census data indicate that less than 10%
of children lived at any one point in time in house-
holds headed by grandparents since the middle of
this century. The proportion of children exposed to
such living arrangements was highest in 1950 (5.8%),
then it decreased during the 1960s (4.0%) and 1970s
(3.2%), and started to rise again since the late 1980s
(5.6% in 1995). Throughout this century, Whites were
much less likely than other racial or ethnic groups to
live in grandparent-headed households. For exam-
ple, in 1993 only 3.7% of White but 12.1% of Black
children lived in grandparents' households (Saluter,
1996; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1953,1964,1973).
Assessments of current household structure may
considerably underestimate lifetime exposure to ex-
tended households. Earlier analyses of data from the
first wave of the NSFH indicate that 18% of Blacks
and 9% of Whites have ever lived in the household
of a grandparent, whereas 11% of Blacks and 19% of
Whites had a grandparent live with their family (Szi-
novacz, 1996). Thus, well over one quarter of the
NSFH respondents experienced coresidence with
grandparents sometime during their childhood or
adolescence, a percentage considerably higher than
that captured by the census data (see also Hernan-
dez & Myers, 1993).
Expected Trends
The purpose of this article is to assess whether
prevailing depictions of grandparenthood are accu-
rate. The preceding literature review suggests the
following characterization of today's grandparents:
1. Most individuals will experience grandparent-
hood.
2. The onset of grandparenthood typically occurs
during middle age. However, there will be some
heterogeneity in the timing of grandparenthood.
Specifically, minorities and women will experi-
ence grandparenthood earlier than Whites and
men.
3. Grandparents typically survive beyond their grand-
children's adolescence, and grandchildren have
several surviving grandparents by the time they
reach adulthood (age 18). This trend should apply
regardless of grandchildren's birth order.
4. Because of gender differences in life expectancy
and age differences between spouses, grandchil-
dren should be most likely to have surviving ma-
ternal grandmothers and least likely to have sur-
viving paternal grandfathers.
5. The concept of the beanpole family suggests that
the majority of families will have a surviving
great-grandparent or four living generations (or
that grandparents will have a surviving parent at
least while their grandchildren are still young).
6. Grandparenthood and active parenthood have
become sequential life phases. Thus, at the onset
of grandparenthood most individuals will no
longer have dependent children in the house-
hold.
7. Widow(er)hood will typically follow rather than
precede the transition to grandparenthood. Con-
sequently, only a minority of grandparents with
young grandchildren will be widowed.
8. Between 20% and 25% of grandparents will be
stepgrandparents either through their own or
through their adult children's divorces and re-
marriages.
9. The majority of grandparents (both male and
female) with young grandchildren will be em-
40 The Gerontologist
ployed. The majority of older grandparents (age
60 and over) or of grandparents with older grand-
children will not be employed.
10. Because the census data refer to living arrange-
ments of children rather than grandparents, it
is difficult to estimate how many grandparents
live in extended households. The census data
would suggest that less than 10% of grandparents
will reside with grandchildren at any one point in
time, but a considerably higher proportion (20%
or more) should have ever lived with grandchil-
dren. Upward extended households should pre-
vail among Whites, whereas downward extended
households should be more common among
Blacks.
Methods
Sample
This study relies on Wave 2 of the NSFH, which
was conducted from 1992 to 1994 (N = 10,008). The
NSFH is based on a multistage area probability sam-
ple, which was augmented by oversampling of mi-
norities, one-parent families, families with stepchil-
dren, cohabitors, and recently married persons. The
oversample was achieved by doubling the number of
targeted households. The original sample (including
the oversample) consisted of 33,869 addresses. These
addresses were first screened, and successfully
screened households were approached for inter-
views. Data for the first wave were collected from a
randomly selected household member age 19 or
more, his/her spouse, and a tertiary household mem-
ber (if the respondent was a child or other relative of
the householder). First wave interview response
rates for the successfully screened households were
73.5% for the main sample and 76.8% for the over-
sample, resulting in a total sample of 13,017 respon-
dents. The response rate for spouses was 83.2%.
Most respondents (n = 10,008) completed the Wave 2
interviews, representing an attrition rate of 23.2%. To
restore the representativeness of the Wave 2 data,
weights adjust for sampling and response rates at
Time 1 as well as attrition in Wave 2. (For a detailed
description of the study design and sample, see
Sweet, Bumpass, & Call, 1988).
All data presented here (except for those based on
grandchildren's responses) are weighted to adjust
for oversampling of selected population groups as
well as refusals and attrition. Because the grandchil-
dren data rely on responses from "focal" children
(one child age 9 or over was randomly selected to be
interviewed), they are not comparable to the total
sample. Therefore, use of overall weights would be
inappropriate, and special weights for the focal chil-
dren are not available. The analyses presented below
rely on different subsamples, contingent on the "at-
risk" population. For example, analyses of specific
characteristics of grandparents are based on the sub-
sample of current grandparents. The subsample sizes
for these groups are shown in the tables.
Measures
Data on the prevalence of grandparenthood rely
on two sources: respondents' own reports and inter-
views with focal children age 9 to 26. Respondents
were asked whether and how many grandchildren
they have and how old their youngest and oldest
grandchild is. In addition, they completed household
rosters both for all current household members as
well as for children and spouse's children living out-
side the household. The current household roster in-
cludes information on all household members' rela-
tionship to the respondent (including children,
stepchildren, and grandchildren). Furthermore, re-
spondents were asked to complete a series of ques-
tions about children (own and stepchildren) both in-
side and outside the household, including their ages,
and for children age 16 and over, the respondents
were asked to answer questions about marital status,
number of children, and whether the child has
stepchildren. Existence and number of grandchildren
for respondents was derived from both the direct
questions about grandparenthood as well as the
household rosters. Comparisons of both measures
not only serve validation purposes but can also pro-
vide some preliminary assessment on whether self-
defined grandparenthood differs from strictly biolog-
ical grandparenthood. Self-defined grandparenthood
may include stepgrandchildren as well as "fictive
grandchildren" who may have any blood or other re-
lationship to the respondent. Grandchildren's re-
sponses are based on questions about whether each
of their grandparents is currently alive.
To estimate duration of grandparents' survival, the
timing of grandparenthood, as well as the prevalence
of three- and four-generation families, the analyses
further rely on questions about respondents' par-
ents. Specifically, respondents were asked whether
their parents are still alive and, if alive, how old their
parents are. If parents had died, information was ob-
tained on the year of death and parents' age at the
time of their deaths. By converting all age data (e.g.,
birth of first child, birth of last grandchild, death of
parent) to calendar years, it was possible to calculate
parents' survival for specific grandparent transitions
(e.g., birth of their first grandchild or great-grand-
child). It should be noted that nonresponses were
relatively high for these questions especially when
parents had died a long time ago. Furthermore, some
responses were clearly invalid (e.g., age at birth of
children or grandchildren was biologically impossi-
ble or highly unlikely). Because the validity of re-
sponses about parents is sometimes ambiguous (for
example, men may have children late in life), births
prior to age 12 and after age 49 were treated as miss-
ing, yielding altogether 5% missing responses for
mothers and 14% missing responses for fathers. Cal-
culations of respondents' own timing of parenthood
and grandparenthood were based on responses con-
cerning their own ages, the ages of their children,
and the ages of their youngest and oldest grandchild.
To assess the prevalence of stepgrandparenthood,
it is necessary to combine information on children
Vol. 38, No. 1,1998 41
and stepchildren with information on divorce in fam-
ilies. Stepgrandparenthood occurs when (a) individu-
als with children have living stepparents, (b) individ-
uals with stepchildren have living parents or
individuals with children from another person than
the current spouse have living parents-in-law, (c)
when individuals' own children or their partners'
children have stepchildren, or (d) when individuals
or their partners' stepchildren have children. These
different types of stepgrandparenthood were de-
rived from data on respondents' and their partners'
children (based on the household and child rosters)
as well as from information on the survival and mari-
tal status of their parents and parents-in-law. The
household and child rosters yield the necessary data
on whether or not respondents' own or their part-
ners' children have children or stepchildren, whether
respondents' children are offspring of their current
partners, and whether respondents have stepchil-
dren. Because data on ex-spouses' children (who are
not respondents' own children) are fragmentary and
ex-stepchildren may not be defined as relatives, most
of the analyses rely on married respondents and
stepchildren from their current partners.
The analyses on stepparents rely exclusively on
stepparents who are currently married to respon-
dents' parents. This relatively narrow definition of
stepparents seems warranted for both data availabil-
ity and conceptual reasons. Although the NSFH does
contain information on stepparents during respon-
dents' childhood, no information is available on step-
parents acquired after childhood but who are no
longer married to respondents' parents. From a con-
ceptual standpoint it also is not clear whether step-
parents are still considered as such once their mar-
riages to respondents' parents are dissolved by death
or divorce. The overall prevalence of stepgrandpar-
enthood was assessed by determining whether any
of the relationships described under (a) through (d)
above was present for either spouse.
The analyses on household extension and surro-
gate parenting rely mostly on information from the
household rosters. Respondents indicated whether
grandchildren or children (their own, their spouses',
or in-laws) with children reside in the household. On
the basis of these data as well as on information con-
cerning children's marital status, it was determined
whether grandchildren are in the household with or
without their parents. Because coresidence with
grandchildren is not always indicative of grandpar-
ents' surrogate parenting, especially if the grandpar-
ent is not the householder, separate analyses were
performed for grandparents who are and those who
are not household heads or spouses of household
heads. The interviews further contained the question
"Did you ever have primary responsibility for your
grandchild(ren) for more than six months?" Those
answering "yes" were classified as having been sur-
rogate parents, regardless of whether or not they are
currently surrogate parents. Analyses referring to this
question thus represent lifetime experiences of sur-
rogate parenting among today's grandparents. Fuller-
Thomson, Minkler, and Driver's (1997) analyses of
the NSFH data offer more detailed analyses of the
composition of surrogate grandparents. However,
their analyses focus on those grandparents who
were surrogate parents during the 1990s. They thus
exclude those grandparents who stopped their sur-
rogate roles prior to 1990.
Assessment of the prevalence of three-generation
households also relies on the household rosters.
Three-generation households were defined as house-
holds that include either a household member of the
parent generation (respondents' own parent, step-
parent, or parent-in-law) and respondents' children
(including children-in-law and stepchildren) or
households that include children (including stepchil-
dren and children-in-law) and grandchildren or step-
grandchildren.
To arrive at estimates of grandparents' other re-
sponsibilities, we considered their involvement in
other family roles as well as their employment status.
Family responsibilities refer to the presence of a liv-
ing parent (in this case, only respondents' own par-
ents were counted), of dependent children (age 18
or under) in the household, and of a spouse. Respon-
dents were deemed full-time employed if they
worked 30 h or more per week. Because involvement
in such roles may change during grandparenthood,
the data are presented separately for all grandpar-
ents and for those with grandchildren age 5 or
under.
Results
Prevalence
As shown in Table 1, between one third and two
fifths of all NSFH respondents are grandparents. This
proportion increases to about two thirds when only
individuals "at risk" of grandparenthood (i.e., those
with children of childbearing age) are considered.
Eventually, though, very few individuals remain
grandchildless: Among those with children aged 40
years and over, close to 95% are grandparents. On
average, grandparents have five to six grandchildren.
The data further indicate that over 80% of today's
families contain three generations, and 16% have
four or more living generations. It should be noted
that the estimates of three- and four-generation
families shown here are likely underestimates. Be-
cause the NSFH does not contain information on the
survival of respondents' grandparents or the exis-
tence of great-grandchildren, only adjacent genera-
tions and grandchildren could be considered in the
calculations.
Prevalence and number of grandchildren vary by
both gender and race or ethnicity. Generally, His-
panic men report grandparent status somewhat less
frequently than other men and women. A similar
trend is apparent for Black men whose children are
age 40 and over.
Because the onset of grandparenthood occurs ear-
lier for Blacks (both men and women) as well as for
Hispanic women, well over one half of Black women
but only one third of White women under age 55 are

bSelf-defined grandparenthood reflects "yes" responses to the question whether respondent has any grandchildren. Children's chil-
dren refers to an assessment of grandparenthood based on whether respondent reports that his/her children have themselves children
using the household rosters. Unless otherwise indicated, self-defined grandparenthood is used in the analyses.

grandmothers. The earlier onset of grandparenthood
among Blacks also enhances the proportion with
four-generation families: Compared to under 20%
for all other groups, about 25% of Black women aged
35 and over have living parents, children, and grand-
children.
Comparisons between self-defined and biological
(children's children) grandparenthood reveal some
ambiguity in the definition of grandparenthood.
Generally, both figures for prevalence and number
of grandchildren are somewhat higher for self-de-
fined than biological grandparenthood. Apart from
reporting errors (some grandparents have over 20
grandchildren and may very well have given incon-
sistent answers because of the large number of
grandchildren), the acknowledgment of stepgrand-
children as grandchildren or the incorporation of
"fictive" grandchildren into one's kin network may
account for these discrepancies. Because the dis-
crepancies are most pronounced for Black and His-
panic women who are more prone than other groups
to adopt fictive kin (Scott & Black, 1994; Stack, 1974)
or to have stepgrandchildren (see below), the results
probably reflect real differences and not only mea-
surement error. Black men are the only grandparents
who report fewer self-defined than biological grand-
children.
Survival
The analyses relying on reports of grandchildren
(Table 2) confirm both gender and lineage effects in
grandparents' survival: Maternal grandmothers are
most likely to survive into grandchildren's adult
years, followed by paternal grandmothers, maternal
grandfathers, and paternal grandfathers. In addition,
there are significant race differences in the survival
of grandparents for the young children (age 9 to 18).
White grandchildren are more likely to report that
any of their grandparents are alive than are Hispanic
and Black grandchildren. These differences are par-
ticularly pronounced for grandfathers (both maternal
and paternal). Except for maternal grandmothers
who tend to be the youngest grandparent, similar
race differences do not occur for older grandchil-
dren (age 19 to 26), perhaps as a consequence of the
mortality crossover in old age (Markides & Black,
1995; Markides & Machalek, 1991). The data further
show that most grandchildren will experience the
death of one or more grandparents during adoles-
cence and early adulthood. Even by age 12, only one
third of grandchildren have four living grandparents.
This proportion declines to fewer than 10% for
grandchildren in their mid-20s. Nevertheless, the
majority of grandchildren (about 70%) have more
than two living grandparents by the time they reach
adulthood.
For the most part, data based on respondents' re-
ports confirm these trends (see Table 3). Respon-
dents' parents typically survived past the births of re-
spondents' first- and last-born children, and close to
two thirds of respondents' mothers and about 40%
of their fathers survived the birth of respondents' first
grandchild (or the parents' first great-grandchild).

aData for "young" (9-18) and "old" (19-26) children are contained in two separate data files. Significance tests for age differences are,
therefore, presented separately for each group of children.
Significance tests for the first four columns indicate whether grandparents' survival differs by children's age and race. Significance
tests for the last five columns indicate whether number of living grandparents differs by children's age and race.
However, fewer than 30% of respondents' mothers
and fewer than 15% of their fathers survived to the
birth of their last great-grandchild. By the time re-
spondents' children reach early middle age (age 30
or over) or their oldest grandchild reaches school
age, the majority of respondents' parents (80% of
mothers and 90% of fathers) are no longer alive.
Gender and lineage effects are again evident. Re-
spondents' mothers are more likely to survive grand-
children's and especially great-grandchildren's births,
and women's parents survive longer than men's.
However, the race effects differ from those shown
for grandchildren's reports. The longer survival of
White grandparents shown in the grandchildren's re-
ports is not upheld by respondents' data, and race
differences vary depending on the specific survival
date (e.g., birth of first or last child or grandchild)
under consideration. This discrepancy between
grandchildren's and respondents' reports may occur
because grandchildren's birth order is not controlled
in the data relying on grandchildren's report.
Timing of Grandparenthood
As expected, the transition to grandparenthood
occurs during middle age (under age 50), whereas
the transition to great-grandparenthood typically hap-
pens in young-old age (age 60 to 65). This trend ap-
plies to both respondents as well as to their parents
and to both male and female grandparents (Table 4).
However, close to a third of respondents experience
grandparenthood off-time, either before age 40 or
after age 60 (data not shown in the table).
The onset of grandparenthood and great-grand-
parenthood varies by gender and race. Minorities
and especially Blacks experience grandparenthood
and great-grandparenthood earlier than Whites, and
women experience these transitions earlier than
men. The cumulative effects of both race and gender
can lead to substantial differences in the timing of
grandparenthood. For example, on average White
men make the transition to grandparenthood about
9 years later than Black women and Whites start
great-grandparenthood about 5 years later than
Blacks. There also are pronounced race and gender
differences in the experience of off-time grandpar-
enthood. Black women are particularly prone to
enter grandparenthood early; that is, before age 40
(37.6% of Black women compared to 16% of White
women), whereas both White (16%) and Black men
(16.8%) make the transition at age 60 or later. Be-
cause some Black women (13.6%) also experience
grandparenthood late, this means that the majority
of Black women (51.2%) enter grandparenthood off-
time, compared to 27.9% of White and 34.1% of His-
panic women. Similarly, 38.2% of Black men but only
23.5% of White and 21.4% of Hispanic men enter
grandparenthood either early or late.
The interval between the births of the first and last
grandchild is quite long; on average it is a decade
and close to 15 years for Blacks. On the other hand,
the interval between the births of respondents' last
child and their first grandchild is typically less than 18
years, so that the majority (62%) experience some
overlap of active parenthood and grandparenthood.
Overlapping experiences of active parenthood and
grandparenthood are particularly common among
Blacks (close to 80%) but much less prevalent among
Whites (less than 60%).

ferent roles. Thus, it is not surprising that the great
majority of grandparents have roles other than
grandparenthood (see Table 5). Except for Black
women, the majority of grandparents are married,
about one third still have at least one living parent,
and about a third are full-time employed. In addition,
10% of all grandparents and over one quarter of mi-
nority grandparents have dependent children in
their households. These numbers increase some-
what when only grandparents with preschool-age
grandchildren are considered. About one half of
these grandparents have three or more competing
roles. Primarily due to their higher labor force partic-
ipation rates, grandfathers are somewhat more likely
than grandmothers to have multiple roles. Minorities
(especially Blacks) tend to have more roles than

Whites, because of their higher involvement in all
roles (employment, active parenting, living parents)
except marriage. On the other hand, about one quar-
ter of female grandparents of all races report no in-
volvement in any of the roles under consideration.
Divorce
The data on stepgrandparenthood are presented
separately by age of respondents' children (Table 6).
For respondents with children under 18, stepgrand-
parenthood occurs either through the divorce of
their parents or parents-in-law or through respon-
dents' own divorce. Stepgrandparenthood through
divorce in respondents' parents' generation is rela-
tively rare (less than 10% except for Black men). In
contrast, between 15 and 30% of married individuals
have stepchildren and living parents and between
one quarter and one half of couples have stepchil-
dren and surviving parents. These proportions are
even higher when stepgrandparents from several
generations are considered. The prevalence of step-
grandparents in families differs by race: Black fami-
lies are much more likely to include stepgrandpar-
ents than either Whites or Hispanics.
As far as respondents with adult children are con-
cerned, about one quarter become stepgrandparents
through their own or their spouse's divorce. How-
ever, close to 10% derive their stepgrandparent status
through their children's divorces. Considering the
prevalence of divorce in all generations and by both
current spouses results in much higher proportions:
Close to two fifths of couples with adult children
have at least one stepgrandparent relationship in
their family. As in the case of individuals with young
children, race differences are pronounced: Over 55%
of Black couple families contain stepgrandparents
compared to less than 40% of Whites and Hispanics.
These data demonstrate that stepgrandparenthood
is becoming a widespread phenomenon among fam-
ilies of all races and characterizes the majority of
Black couples. It should also be noted that the partic-
ularly complex family structures created by multiple
divorces involving children are becoming more com-
mon. Whereas fewer than 5% of couples report step-
grandparent relations in more than one generation,
between 10% and 33% of couples report more than
two divorces (e.g., both spouses, parent and spouse,
etc.) involving children in their families (data not
shown). Multiple divorces also vary by race: 32.5% of
Black couples with children over 18 and 24.9% of
Black couples with children under 18 report multiple
divorces involving children, compared to, respec-
tively, 18.5% and 10.8% of Whites, and 20.2% and
13.7% of Hispanics.

Surrogate Parenting and Household Extension
The data on household composition are shown in
Table 7. Overall, 3.3% of respondents live in house-
holds with grandchildren and 4.7% live in house-
holds with three or more generations. These propor-
tions are considerably higher when grandparents are
used as the sample basis and vary significantly by
race and gender: Twenty-six percent of Black and
close to 23% of Hispanic grandmothers live in house-
holds with grandchildren, compared to only 7% of
White grandmothers and 4% of White grandfathers.
Well over one quarter of Black but only 12% of White
grandmothers were surrogate parents for grandchil-
dren sometime during their lives.
Most households with grandchildren are down-
ward extended (i.e., the grandparent is the house-
holder). This applies especially to minorities (89% of
Blacks and 90% of Hispanics), whereas close to 18%
of White grandparents living with grandchildren are
not householders. Furthermore, among grandpar-
ents in upward extended households, White grand-
parents typically live with married children and their
children, whereas Black grandparents live either
with a single parent (usually a daughter) and her
children or with relatives other than the grandchil-
dren's parents.
When grandparents are the householders, the
household rarely includes both of grandchildren's
parents. Prevalent in this situation are households in-
cluding the grandchildren's single mother, but grand-
parent-headed households with neither of grandchil-
dren's parents also are relatively common. Sons with
children only rarely reside with their parents.
Summary and Discussion
The main objective of this article was to present a
representative demographic profile of today's grand-
parents and to contrast it with prevalent descriptions
of demographic trends in the grandparenthood ex-
perience. Generally, the profile of grandparents
evolving from the NSFH data is consistent with many
of the trends noted in earlier research. Nevertheless,
some modifications in earlier depictions of grandpar-
enthood seem warranted.
The data confirm that grandparenthood is a near

universal experience. In addition, most grandparents
have multiple (on average, 5 to 6) grandchildren.
However, about 15% of Black and Hispanic men re-
port that they are not grandparents. Two factors may
account for the lower proportion of grandparents
among minority men: immigration (for Hispanics)
and nonmarital parenthood or divorce among re-
spondents' children. Especially older Hispanic men
who immigrated during midlife may have lost con-
tact with their adult children and thus may not know
whether or not they have grandchildren. Similarly,
the greater prevalence of mother-headed families
among both Blacks and Hispanics (Hernandez &
Myers, 1993) may isolate older men from their kin
(Cooney & Uhlenberg, 1990) and thus reduce their
awareness of existing grandchildren. The data also
indicate that it may be quite misleading to infer
grandparent status from individuals' ages. Even
though age and grandparent status are highly corre-
lated, they are by no means identical. For example,
81% of individuals age 65 and over are grandparents
compared to close to 95% of respondents with chil-
dren beyond childbearing age. These discrepancies
reflect individual, generational, as well as cohort dif-
ferences in both childlessness and timing of grand-
parenthood.
Earlier descriptions of grandparenthood as a mid-
life transition (Cherlin & Furstenberg, 1986; Uhlen-
berg, 1980) also are essentially correct, but they
detract attention from the considerable extent of
"off-time" grandparenthood especially among Black
women. Because the majority of Black women make
the transition to grandparenthood either before age
40 or after age 60, timing standards derived from
Whites may be inapplicable to this group. Thus, what
may be defined as "off-time" grandparenthood
among Whites may very well constitute "on-time"
grandparenthood for many Black women. These dis-
crepancies are, however, consistent with claims that
there is considerable heterogeneity in the experi-
ence of grandparenthood among diverse population
subgroups (Bengtson, 1985).
As suggested by numerous authors (George &
Gold, 1991; Uhlenberg, 1996), the extension of
longevity enhanced the duration of grandparent-
hood. The data support assertions about grandpar-
ents' survival into grandchildren's adulthood to
some extent and also confirm gender and lineage ef-
fects reported in earlier studies. The majority of
grandmothers typically survive well into the adult-
hood at least of their oldest grandchild, and close to
two thirds of women experience the birth of great-
grandchildren. Men, on the other hand, are unlikely
to survive to their grandchildren's adulthood or to
the birth of their first great-grandchild. In contrast to
earlier claims that grandchildren will have multiple
surviving grandparents well into their adulthood, the
data indicate that the majority of grandchildren expe-
rience deaths of one or more grandparents well be-
fore they reach adulthood, and the majority have
only one surviving grandparent by the time they
reach their late twenties.
Two reasons could account for the discrepancies
between earlier estimates of grandparents' survival
and the trends revealed in the NSFH data. First,
prevalent generalizations about grandparents' sur-
vival in the literature apparently underestimate the
combined effects of grandfathers' later transition to
grandparenthood and the increased gender gap in
life expectancy. Second, little attention has been paid
to intrafamilial variations in grandparents' and grand-
children's experiences. The data show that the inter-
val between the births of the first and last grandchild
is quite long. This implies that grandparents' survival
and grandchildren's exposure to grandparents of dif-
ferent ages vary considerably, depending on cumula-
tive effects of grandparents' gender and lineage and
grandchildren's birth order. Because of birth order
effects, characterizations applicable to first grandpar-
enthood may not be valid for later born grandchil-
dren. For example, grandparents will typically have
reached late middle age or early old age by the time
their last grandchild is born and a considerable pro-
portion will not survive beyond their youngest grand-
child's adolescence. Similarly, children within the
same family may experience grandparents' deaths at
quite different ages. Furthermore, it might be more
appropriate to conceive the transition to grandpar-
enthood as a process. Whereas the initial transition
to grandparenthood (i.e., the birth of the first grand-
child) may be especially important (Cunningham-
Burley, 1986; Fischer, 1983), additional births of grand-
children occur over a prolonged time period. This
means that grandparents have access to young grand-
children for a considerable time. Thus, the period of
active parenting may have shrunk considerably dur-
ing this century, but many individuals today will be
involved in some child care activities throughout
most of their adult years, first for their own children
and then for their grandchildren.
There also seems to be some validity to criticisms
of the beanpole family concept (Treas, 1995; Uhlen-
berg, 1995). Whereas the majority of families experi-
ence four living generations at some point in time,
the duration of four-generation families is typically
quite short. Thus, the concept of the beanpole fam-
ily--at least as an enduring characteristic of today's
families--may be premature (Farkas & Hogan, 1995).
Claims that parenthood and grandparenthood
now constitute sequential rather than concurrent
roles (Hagestad, 1988; Hagestad & Burton, 1986) also
require some modification. The data suggest, how-
ever, that for the majority of grandparents there is
some overlap of active parenthood and grandparent-
hood and, of course, both roles typically continue si-
multaneously until grandparents'/parents' deaths.
This overlap of active parenthood and grandparent-
hood is particularly common and also of longer dura-
tion among minorities, suggesting that earlier charac-
terizations in the literature may have been racially
and ethnically biased.
As noted previously (Hagestad & Burton, 1986;

each other, as well as the potential for role conflict.
Because today's grandparents survive longer, grand-
parenthood is likely to intersect with multiple life
transitions, and both grandparents' and grandchil-
dren's involvement in other roles will vary consider-
ably over time, introducing even greater hetero-
geneity into the grandparent experience. The data
confirm this depiction in several ways. First, the ini-
tial transition to grandparenthood may be marked by
considerable role overlap and perhaps role conflict.
At the onset of grandparenthood, grandparents are
typically married and employed. Thus, both retire-
ment and widowhood typically occur after the transi-
tion to grandparenthood. Also, whereas much atten-
tion has focused on "sandwiched" caregivers (i.e.,
individuals with dependent children and care re-
sponsibilities for parents), conflicting demands for
the care of older parents and grandchildren are typi-
cally overlooked. The NSFH data indicate, however,
that a considerable proportion of grandparents (and
especially of grandparents with young grandchil-
dren) still have living parents and may very well have
to balance care responsibilities for parents and
grandchildren. Although not explicitly addressed
here, the data on the timing of grandparenthood and
survival into great-grandparenthood further suggest
that many grandchildren (and especially first-born
grandchildren) may experience conflicting role de-
mands from their own families of procreation and
not only their parents but also their grandparents
and great-grandparents. Some of the age differences
in grandparent contacts documented in earlier re-
search (Hodgson, 1992) may very well stem from
older grandchildren's involvement first in mate se-
lection and then in family-of-procreation activities. In
addition, most grandchildren will be exposed to both
grandparents' and great-grandparents' frailty and
eventual deaths.
The NSFH data certainly validate recent research
emphases on divorce and stepgrandparenting (John-
son, 1988; Trygstad & Sanders, 1989). A considerable
proportion of families now include stepgrandpar-
ents. It also is clear, however, that the nearly exclu-
sive focus on divorce in the middle generation is
questionable. In many cases the stepgrandparent re-
lationship is brought about by divorce in the grand-
parents' generation. Furthermore, major studies on
grandparenthood and divorce rely on White samples
(Johnson, 1988). This racial bias in existing research is
particularly troubling because Black families are sig-
nificantly more likely than Whites to include step-
grandparents.
Likewise, the NSFH data attest to the fact that a
considerable proportion, especially of Black grand-
mothers, assume primary responsibility for grand-
children at some point in their lives. This phe-
nomenon is less common among Whites who, on
the other hand, are more likely to have upward ex-
tended households. The fact that lifetime estimates
of surrogate parenting exceed census estimates
based on current household composition was ex-
pected. However, the NSFH data also reveal consid-
erably higher rates of current surrogate parenting
when grandparents are used as sample basis. This
suggests that census data of the total population
considerably underestimate the prevalence of surro-
gate parenting by grandparents.
Conclusion
Despite their simplicity, the data presented here
suggest several directions for future research on
grandparenthood. The data indicate great variability
in the availability of specific grandparents, in the du-
ration of specific grandparent-grandchild relations,
as well as in the number of available grandparents
and grandchildren. This suggests, first, that the em-
phasis on dyadic grandparent-grandchild relations
as well as the rather static approach that permeates
much current grandparent research may be prob-
lematic and lead to biased results. We need to pay
much more attention to the composition of the avail-
able group of grandparents at any one point in time,
as well as to the effect of changes in the composition
of accessible grandparents on relationships between
individual grandparents and grandchildren. The birth
of a new grandchild may alter grandparents' contacts
with other, older grandchildren. Similarly, deaths of
grandparents, acquisition of stepgrandparents, or the
births of siblings or cousins may alter grandchil-
dren's relationships with any one grandparent. We
also need to go further in considering the kin rela-
tionship context of grandparenthood. Although
some studies on the bridge generation exist, more
research is needed on the effects of relationships be-
tween maternal and paternal grandparents as well as
among the sibling group of adult children (the
grandchildren's parents) and among grandchildren
(especially from different adult children).
Second, given the longer duration of grandparent-
hood and the considerable time span between the
births of the first and last grandchild, we need to
consider much more closely contextual factors that
may impinge on grandparent-grandchild relation-
ships, including changes in marital status, health, or
employment status. For example, we should raise
such questions as: How does widowhood of the
grandparent or dating, marriage, and parenthood of
grandchildren affect grandparent-grandchild rela-
tionships? What happens when the "active, fun-seek-
ing" grandparent becomes seriously ill and a care re-
cipient in the family? Or how do grandparents'
retirement and grandchildren's beginning careers
impinge on grandparent-grandchild relationships?
Such attention to contextual factors also is essential
for the interpretation of data on the support func-
tions of the kinship network. Before we come to con-
clusions about lack of instrumental supports be-
tween adult children and their parents--or between
grandparents and grandchildren--we need to take
into account competing obligations and geographi-
cal availability of grandparents/grandchildren, as well
as each generation's need for and ability to provide
supports (see also Eggebeen, 1992a, 1992b).
Third, research on grandparenthood and divorce
needs to be expanded in several ways. It is essential
50 The Gerontologist
to conduct more investigations on divorce and
grandparenthood among minorities and especially
Black families and to examine and compare effects of
divorce in the grandparent and in the adult child
generation on grandparent-grandchild relationships.
Further, stepgrandparent relationships (either
stepchildren's children or children's stepchildren)
require much more research: Are stepgrandchildren
defined as grandchildren? Are there differences in
relationships to stepchildren's children and to chil-
dren's stepchildren? Are meaning and frequency of
contact with stepgrandchildren contingent on the
presence or accessibility of biological grandchildren?
What happens to such relationships if the parent's or
grandparent's marriage is dissolved?
Fourth, research on surrogate parenting needs to
go beyond small, nonrepresentative studies. As
shown here, the phenomenon is sufficiently com-
mon especially among minority families to obtain
larger and more representative samples. Further,
other types of households including grandparents
deserve more attention. Specifically, more research
is needed on intergenerational and grandparent-
grandchild relationships in grandparent- or parent-
headed households with single parents as well as on
the effects on grandchildren when a frail grandpar-
ent moves into the household.
Finally, the NSFH data further attest to consider-
able diversity in the grandparent experience and in
grandparent-grandchild relationships among differ-
ent population groups, ranging from the timing of
grandparenthood and the number of grandchildren
to experiences of divorce or surrogate parenting.
The prevalence of specific grandparenthood charac-
teristics within subpopulations may very well alter
their meaning and impact. For example, the conse-
quences of "early" grandparenthood or surrogate
parenting may differ for subpopulations in which
these phenomena are common (e.g., Blacks) or are
relatively rare (e.g., Whites). In addition, subcultural
norms are likely to affect the meaning of grandpar-
ent-grandchild relationships in general and the ef-
fects of specific grandparent-grandchild roles and
experiences in particular. We thus need more re-
search that contrasts the meaning and impact of spe-
cific grandparent experiences by gender, race and
ethnicity, or urban versus rural residence (see King &
Elder, 1995). In addition, heterogeneity within popu-
lation subgroups requires more research. For exam-
ple, we have learned a good deal about Black grand-
mothers who are surrogate parents but we still know
relatively little about the majority of Black grand-
mothers who are not. Indeed, an increased emphasis
on atypical grandparent experiences such as delayed
grandparenthood among Blacks or surrogate parent-
ing among Whites may prove especially beneficial
for theory development.
