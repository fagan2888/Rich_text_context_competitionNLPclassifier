Introduction
A "deluge of data" is a common theme across contemporary
business and consumer cultures in the United States. Digital
technologies allow those with resources and know-how to
create, track, and sort enormous sets of data whether they be
global trends on heart disease or the "cacophony of short-
burst" communications that define the social media platform
Twitter (Carr, 2010). We see the emergence of products like
Google Glass, eyeglasses that overlay data on top of our
daily experiences. Through the glasses, we can video chat
with friends, interface with Google maps, or have updates
pushed to us about, for instance, suspended subway services.
A likely fix in a world full of data: more data to solve prob-
lems of more data.
Data are ubiquitous in IBM's "Smarter Planet" advertise-
ments about the coming "tsunami of information"--Radio-
Frequency Identification (RFID) chip transmissions, store
transactions, medical records, emails, photos, videos, blogs,
traffic patterns, and so on. One of the commercials in the
series asks, "What if technology could capture all this infor-
mation and turn it into intelligence?" IBM could help you
identify patterns faster and "pull insights from the noise."
The company could help organizations "manage their peo-
ple" and "mitigate risk." And, most importantly, they can
help you "convert data into action" (infoondemand, 2009).
Charles Duhigg's (2012) New York Times Magazine piece
"How Companies Learn Your Secrets" offers us another look
into the mysterious world of data. Duhigg tells the tale of
how Target uses data science to better understand its custom-
ers. One of the more humorous and alarming examples is
how Target cross-references purchases to figure out when a
family is pregnant, even though they have not told Target.
Because these algorithmic calculations are based on shop-
ping data, Target can better target ads and discounts more
strategically to these families.
These are just a few examples of the way our everyday
lives are being translated into data. On one hand, access to
data is cast as a coping mechanism for a world overrun with
data. On the other hand, these data are cast as a treasure trove
for businesses seeking audience attention. This emphasis on
creating, managing, and utilizing data falls under the buzz
phrase "Big Data"--data sets too large for traditional com-
putation, and the technologies, engineers, and statisticians
who support it.
Television companies are also experimenting with lever-
aging Big Data as a way to understand audiences and man-
age risk in a data-rich digital media landscape. One of the

Everyday Life as a Text: Soft Control,
Television, and Twitter
Michael Lahey1
Abstract
This article explores how audience data are utilized in the tentative partnerships created between television and social
media companies. Specially, it looks at the mutually beneficial relationship formed between the social media platform Twitter
and television. It calls attention to how audience data are utilized as a way for the television industry to map itself onto the
everyday lives of digital media audiences. I argue that the data-intensive monitoring of everyday life offers some measure of
soft control over audiences in a digital media landscape. To do this, I explore "Social TV"--the relationships created between
social media technologies and television--before explaining how Twitter leverages user data into partnerships with various
television companies. Finally, the article explains what is fruitful about understanding the Twitter­television relationship as a
form of soft control.

reasons the television industry wants to understand its audi-
ences better is because it is increasingly difficult to dictate
when and where audiences will watch (Kastelein, 2013). The
possibilities opened up by a digital media environment for
businesses and audiences alike directly trouble the industry's
ability to dictate clearly windows of distribution. This is a
problem for an industry that has historically been understood
as a "fundamentally scarce service" (Sterne, 1999, p. 506).
On one hand, television companies fight against the prob-
lems present in this type of environment through hard coding
digital rights management into web browser screens and uti-
lize copyright laws to slow down illegal content uses (Moody,
2013).1 On the other hand, some television companies also
actively seek to understand networked digital environments
in terms of the information about audiences that it can pro-
vide. Television companies hope to leverage this knowledge
of audience behaviors in various ways to tame problems of
attention. A key way this happens is through how television
companies use social media for audience information.
This article explores how data are utilized in the tentative
partnerships created between television and social media
companies. Specially, I look to the mutually beneficial rela-
tionship formed between television companies and
Twitter--a social media platform that allows users to send
either single photos, 6 s or less video clips via their Vine app,
or 140 character bursts of communication known as tweets.
Investigating the Twitter­television relationship is not about
any single television program as Twitter's presence in the
social media efforts of virtually all television shows is ubiq-
uitous. Nor is this article about how television companies
might use Twitter to directly engage audience attention.
Rather, it is about how Twitter shares complex analyses of
user behavior with television companies. They call this work
the "TV Genome," and Twitter does this by creating algo-
rithms that connect tweets to television content with very
few context clues.All the user has to do is use Twitter and the
work happens in the background.
In this light, I want to call attention to how audience data
are utilized as a way for the television industry to map itself
onto the everyday lives of contemporary audiences. An
emphasis on everyday life is important because it is at the
level of the everyday, as understood by Henri Lefebvre,
where the materialization of attention and monetization takes
place. In addition, everyday life, as Rita Felski (1999) argues,
is understood as the space and time where we become "accli-
matized to assumptions, behaviors and practices" (p. 31).
While our habitual practices may be processes that we do not
think about too much, I guarantee you that the television
industry charts them in great detail.
The television industry has historically been more or less
interested in consumer data gleaned from viewer rating sys-
tems and focus groups. What is different about data collected
from social media platforms is that it is "wild," collected
from everyday utterances and not within a structured research
scenario (C. Ang, Bobrowicz, Schiano, & Nardi, 2013). This
"wild data" allows television companies access to a broader
spectrum of consumer information in an open-ended format
that allows for more careful tracking of changes in consumer
sentiment over time.
Thus, I want to argue that the data-intensive monitoring of
everyday life offers some measure of soft control over audi-
ences in a digital media landscape. Borrowing from the work
of Gilles Deleuze (1992), Henri Lefebvre (1984), James
Beniger (1986), and Tiziana Terranova (2004), I use the
phrase soft control to define the purposeful actions of the
television industry to shape audience attention toward prede-
termined goals. These interactions between television com-
panies and audiences develop autonomously over time while
often being interjected with prompts and run through differ-
ent iterations. The data collection that happens on Twitter
can be seen as a soft control practice that works in the back-
ground to funnel information about audiences to television
companies. This happens because Twitter gives television
companies in-depth access to unstructured utterances from
the everyday life of the Twitter user. The data that are pro-
duced in this instance occur because people are simply using
Twitter the way it is supposed to be used. Twitter's algorith-
mic scripts have data to parse because, well, we do the work.
They are there to track, atomize, and tabulate us. By looking
specifically at the role Twitter plays in harnessing knowledge
about audience behaviors and practices, I will show how
algorithmic scripts are put into action for the television
industry and how the logic of soft control helps strengthen
various television companies' position in a digital media
environment.
This is not to suggest that television companies can deter-
mine audiences in the strictest sense--that would clearly be
false. Any investigation into "Social TV"--the relationships
created between social media technologies and television--
will quickly uncover that audience attention is not something
that is easily taken for granted. In fact, this process of captur-
ing eyeballs is never fully complete and always in flux.2 But
this does not mean that television companies are not finding
uses of social media to manage the terms of the industry­
audience relationship. The amount of data we pump into this
social feedback loop is astounding and points to the unequal
dynamic between producers and audiences. Thus, even in a
media environment that ostensibly gives more control to the
audience, an uneven playing field exists.
Television, Social Media, and Data
Before moving on to explaining Twitter and the TV Genome,
I want to briefly situate this discussion against the burgeoning
importance of social media to the television industry in terms
of direct engagement and, more importantly, data collection.
And there is a lot of chatter these days about the relationship
of social and traditional media. Twitter is the first thing star
reporter/TV-hostAnderson Cooper reportedly checks when he
wakes up (Anderson, 2011). Advertising Age sees the
Lahey 3
integration of social media into traditional media as producing
a new type of hybrid media (Rubel, 2011). Gail Becker, global
head of Edelman's Digital Media, who counsels the National
Association of Broadcasters, says that we have "officially
entered into an era of social entertainment" when people are
beginning to expect to interact with the entertainment they
consume (Value, Engagement, 2011). Relatedly, in an Edelman
survey of media consumers, 57% of "general consumers 18-54
in the United States" consider social networking as a form of
entertainment, the number jumping to 70% among 18- to
29-year-olds (Value, Engagements, 2011).
Social media are, perhaps obviously, built around the con-
cept of sharing, which is materialized in the ubiquity of
"share" buttons across the Internet. These buttons allow you
to share content across a variety of platforms and socially
enabled sites. This web application programming interface
(API)-enabled form of communication is hybrid from top to
bottom. While some platforms like Facebook started ostensi-
bly as a way to allow friends to communicate, consumer- and
media-oriented companies have flooded this space as a way
to reach out to their customers wherever they are. This mix-
ture of consumer, personal, and interpersonal messages is
precisely what these companies are after--"a superior align-
ment of commercial, consumer, and wider public interests"
(Spurgeon, 2008, p. 113).
It is clear that there is a burgeoning connection between
television and social media. According to Lost Remote, a
blog about Social TV, "Facebook is [now] a huge distribution
and promotional platform for TV shows" (Bergman, 2012).
As of May of 2011, 275 million Facebook users had liked
television shows 1.65 billion times, and television shows are
always well represented during the evenings on Twitter's top
10 trending words (Bergman, 2012). In hoping to reproduce
the so-called "water cooler effect" through social media,
television companies believe they have to remap their prod-
ucts onto the times and spaces of contemporary consumers
(Stelter, 2011).
Television companies use social media platforms like
Facebook and Twitter for what we could call direct audience
engagement. These instances can be mundane, like when
Nina Dobrev, an actress formerly of the CW's The Vampire
Diaries, tweets out to fans:
Feeling soooooo much love from the Teens!!! Thank you for
nominating me--you guys are amazing! <3 you!!!! @
teenchoicenews
This tweet is retweeted by The Vampire Diaries' official
Twitter account, creating more circulation. A "perhaps-fan"
(we really do not know about much about "her"--if she is a
bot, corporate account, etc.) like @dobrevselenas can
respond to the tweet with "@ninadobrev you deserve it baby,
i love you more <3."
There are also award-winning (or at least nominated) uses
of social media. The Shorty Awards gives annual recognition
to the best uses of social media by television companies.
TNT's Legends was nominated in 2015 for best use of a
Twitter hashtag with #DontKillSeanBean, capitalizing on the
popularity of the pop culture meme that questions why Sean
Bean, the main actor in Legends, dies in everything. BBC
America's Orphan Black was also nominated in 2015 for its
use of social media--Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter--to create
content for the #CloneClub, a group of passionate fans
labeled after the show's central theme of genetic cloning
("Best in Television," 2015). HBO was nominated in 2014
for its work with 360i, a digital marketing agency, on Game
of Thrones to create #ROASTJOFFREY, a 48-hr, crowd-
sourced social media comedy roast of King Joffrey, a reviled
character on the show ("Best Use of Social Media for
Television," 2014).
Although these examples are worthy of investigation in
their own right, for the purposes of this article, an important
way to understand the burgeoning relationship between
social media and the television industry is through the types
of partnerships that occur in the process of building and shar-
ing data sets on potential audiences.
Television's contemporary interest in mining social
media platforms for user data parallels their interest in direct
audience engagement through social media campaigns, and
the two are often intertwined. Television companies look to
partner with data-rich companies like Google, Facebook,
Twitter, Acxiom, and BlueKai that offer more data on cus-
tomers than the television industry could collect alone.3
These are what Joseph Turow (2006) would call "permis-
sion-based" databases that collect data to analyze consumer
behavior (p. 88).
There are many reasons--including improving program-
ming and digital ad targeting--behind this push into Big
Data. For instance, all the major networks--ABC, CBS, and
NBC--have set up their own analytics companies that mix
first- and third-party data as a way to handle the flood of data
from social media and traditional data sources (Thielman,
2015a, 2015b). Black Entertainment Television (BET) part-
nered with Adobe Social to create a social listening cam-
paign to shift how it marketed the hit show Being Mary Jane
(Enright-Schulz, 2014). Similarly, HBO partnered with
Arktan SocialTrends and Facebook to mine user data as a
way to shape promotion for the final season of True Blood
(Aggarwal, 2014). In addition, Time Warner Cable utilizes
user data to "target customers with the same advertising
campaign simultaneously in cable television, mobile devices,
the web, social media advertising, and other platforms"
(Ungerleider, 2013). In doing so, Time Warner creates data
profiles by combining viewing habits with information that
data management companies collect such as voter registra-
tion records and real estate records. All these data create a
very specific profile of who a user is or could potentially be.
This personalization can then be fed back into the many
interconnected platforms and technologies, creating slight
differences in approach for each individual.

Let us turn now to Twitter for a more in-depth example of
how data are used to shape the industry­audience relation-
ship before explaining how we can view this as a form of soft
control.
Twitter and the TV Genome
On June 4, 2013, @bobbychiu wrote "My expression after
watching Game of Thrones this week . . . Omg" which was
paired with a picture of a rabbit emerging from a hole, ears
perked, face wide with terror.
The most interesting thing about this tweet is that it has no
direct connection to the HBO show Game of Thrones. This
user is not trying to talk back to Game of Thrones; he or she
is merely sharing his opinion with a range of his followers
and using Twitter the way it is supposed to be used. Thus,
this individual is just tweeting about what is happening in his
or her everyday life. It just happens that this expression is
hosted on a platform that catalogs this sentiment and algo-
rithmically aggregates it with the other tweets connected to
Game of Thrones.
As one person, @bobbychiu's comments are fun but once
aggregated have the potential to paint a picture of broader
consumer sentiment. It makes sense that television compa-
nies would want access to Twitter's data as evidence sug-
gests that Twitter usage portrays a different picture of the
popularity of shows than traditional Nielsen ratings do (Amol
& Vranica, 2013). In addition, Twitter has been leveraging its
relationship with television in an attempt to monetize the
platform. As Sarah Perez of TechCrunch says, Twitter is
"betting big on being the TV companion app" (Perez, 2013).
To better understand how these data are aggregated, let us
look at Bluefin Labs, one of many companies (Radian6,
General Sentiment, Sysomos, Converseon, and Trendrr) in
the growing field of Social TV analytics. According to
Bluefin Labs, their clients include 40 of the largest TV net-
works in the US (Conyers, 2012). Founded in 2008, Bluefin
was purchased by Twitter in February of 2013 to shore up a
relationship to television companies (MacMillan, 2013).
Bluefin calls its work in Social TV analytics the "TV
Genome." This "genome" is created by cross-referencing
comments made on Twitter with program guide information,
the names of characters and actors, closed-captioning text,
demographic information about who is commenting, along
with an advertising schedule that Bluefin created. The
"genome" works in two tiers, one tied into those watching
within a 3-hr window of the show and another focusing on
the 90 days after a show's premiere to catch time-shifted
viewing.4
This is a data-driven approach that uses tweets as data
points in conjunction with the unstructured data of television
video feeds. To create something like a "graph" of television,
Bluefin records linear television streams and turns these
feeds into data. Data are not just something that exist.
Everything in our world only has the potential to become
datum and only does so when it is translated into a "unit or
morsel" of information (Gitelman & Jackson, 2013, p. 1). To
put it another way, this video is just a feed full of potential
data until it translated into mapped data. Bluefin has experi-
ence in trying to map video data; Michael Fleischman, the
chief technology officer of Bluefin, actually worked to help
machines recognize home runs by watching Boston Red Sox
game broadcasts (Graham-Rowe, 2007).
When a video feed is translated into data, it would first be
broken down into still images, or frames, and then stored into
something like an Apache HBase--a Big Data file system
where you can store images. The images are stored as raster
images (as pixels with discrete number values for color) or
vector images (color-annotated polygons). The images are
then broken down into particular features based on pixel
placement, luminance, color, patterns of pixel movement
(including camera movement), and so on. Once the video
image is broken down into discrete units, it is available as
data. An algorithm can then be taught to recognize what is
happening on the screen based on how it cross-references
pixel or polygon movement and audio wavelengths as visual
data are connected with automatic speech recognition sys-
tems to improve accuracy. Thus, for instance, Twitter's algo-
rithms know when King Joffrey from Game of Thrones is
doing something sadistic or when Detective Linden from
AMC's The Killing is having a bad day. This ability to break
the image down into readable data allows every channel that
Bluefin monitors to be precisely mapped.
The semantic analysis that Bluefin does for specific chan-
nels­including shows, advertisements, interstitials­is made
meaningful for television companies when combined with an
analysis of tweets. This allows Bluefin to have a very spe-
cific knowledge of when conversations about a television
program are occurring. To more precisely catalog what the
folks on Twitter think of particular shows, Bluefin breaks the
language of tweets down into categories that are more
sophisticated than good or bad--"vulgar or polite, serious or
amused, calm or excited" (Talbot, 2011). Thus, Bluefin utli-
ziies deep machine learning algorthims that are utlizied to
give order and meaning to comments pulled from social
media.
While Twitter also uses Bluefin to target advertisements
at particular tweeters, the use of tweets to create a map of
human behavior is another animal altogether (Lunden, 2013).
This map ingests data from a variety of places we can be in
our everyday lives--at work, home, at a friend's house, or a
bar. As long as we have a smartphone and a Twitter app (or
on another app running Twitter's API), we can do the things
we may normally do: respond to a tweet by a friend, com-
ment about the role of nudity in HBO programming, pro-
claim excitement over the trajectory of a particular character
arc, or any other example from the vast array of choices that
constitute our everyday lives. Translating the playing we do
on Twitter into data, Bluefin atomizes our tweets and reas-
sembles them into larger identified data trends that look
Lahey 5
something like water cooler "talk." In this way, the social
media we may create--in this instance, a tweet--becomes
the data for television companies to better understand how
we feel about television.
How are the things that occur in the Twitter-TV partner-
ship any different from a longer history of companies trying
to understand their audiences? According to James Beniger
(1986), the technologies "for collecting and processing all
these types of information" appear in the late 1910s and
develop through the 1930s (p. 378). Yet this was still a rela-
tively unsophisticated process at the time, as Karen Buzzard
(2012) notes,
Prior to the 1930s, knowledge of media audiences consisted
primarily of subjective impressions such as anecdotes, postcards
mailed in by the audiences, and other schemes conceived by
advertisers. (p. 2)
Since that time, audience research has grown into a robust
industry supporting a range of other media industries as they
tried to control the "reciprocal flow of information from the
mass audience back to the media writers and programmers"
with the goal of closing the gap between ideal behavior (what
they wanted) and real behavior (what actually happened;
Beniger, 1986, p. 276). By the 1960s,
the expansion of the research community also made the social
scientist a common figure in marketing circles, and introduced
social science terminology into marketing and advertising
jargon. The result was a pressure to generate more detailed and
deeper descriptions of consumer behavior. (Arvidsson, 2011,
p. 277)
In relation to television, by the end of the 1960s, Nielsen
Media Reach became a monopoly provider for audience
information to the television industry. Nielsen's methods
have, over time, become more sophisticated, moving from
diary usage where a statistically meaningful range of indi-
viduals self-reported behavior to, since 1984, the use of the
People Meter to technologically track viewing habits
(Buzzard, 2012).
The point of this brief historical tour is to situate practices
of trying to understand audiences with a longer tradition. As
Mark Andrejevic (2009) says, contemporary efforts "to track
the behavior of viewers can trace their lineage back to the
efforts of early audience rating researchers to find a two-way
channel for monitoring the audience" (pp. 33-34). This
means that the technological methods offered by social
media platforms are "amplified or supercharged" versions of
audience research and not completely different (Deuze,
2009, p. 144). Thus, what makes social media compelling for
media companies is the sheer amount of potentially usable
data that these data-rich environments foster. Surveys and
diaries are a voluntary form of engagement, whereas social
media data are often referred to as "wild." This means it is
not based on surveys, diaries, or viewing logs collected from
a small sample of TV viewers but rather these data simply
exist as a function of the way the Internet and social media
technologies work. For instance, we simply have to log on to
Facebook, click through some links, and chat with some
friends, or post our opinion about a TV show on Twitter. This
is a key feature to how soft control works now; we simply
have to live and let the background scripts do their algorith-
mic parsing.
Soft Control and Everyday Life
How can Twitter's TV Genome be seen as a form of soft
control in the dynamics created in industry­audience rela-
tionships? To explain this, I need to fully define soft control.
By all means, control is a scary word. For me, it conjures up
old fears of subliminal advertising, that is, this message
made me do that specific thing, but I am unaware of the
cause of my behavior.5 Although this looming, sinister form
of control is a very popular usage of the term, it is but one of
the many ways control has been imagined academically.
In The Control Revolution, a sweeping rereading of
Earth's history through the framework of informational con-
trol, James Beniger (1986) offers a good starting point to
understand how the term can be used. Beniger explains con-
trol using a range of definitions from determination to influ-
ence. He refers to these as existing on a continuum between
stronger and softer forms of control. The only thing that
encapsulates these different definitions is the notion of a
"predetermined goal." Thus, to Beniger (1986), "all control
is thus programmed" (p. 40).
Focusing on the role technology and the economy play, he
looks at how public institutions dealt with social control in a
19th- and 20th-century industrial world increasing in size
and speed. Beniger (1986) points to the concepts of informa-
tion and feedback as central to understanding control. This
means that since the 1840s, long before the "Information
Age," social organizations needed to be able to utilize infor-
mation as quickly and efficiently as they did material energy
resources. Simply, if the world was moving faster, more
information was needed to shape the direction of that world.
Looking at the rise of the advertising industry as a
"nascent infrastructure for control of consumption," Beniger
(1986) points to the long list of innovations in the industry--
newspaper distribution numbers, coupon reinforcement, the
scientific methods of audience investigation by advertisers
like Claude Hopkins--as proof of this desire for control.
This information was used as a feedback technology to gain
a better understanding of the audience and how to reach it.
Beniger clearly is indebted to the work of cybernetics and
information theory as seen through his citations of luminar-
ies like Claude Shannon and Norbert Wiener, two founding
figures in the study of information. Wiener (1948) defines
cybernetics as the science of control and communication
across a range of biological and man-made machines.6 The
focus of cybernetics, as W. Ross Ashby (1957) says in An
6 SAGE Open
Introduction to Cybernetics, was to understand the behavior
of machines as far as they were "regular, or determinate, or
reproducible" (p. 1). This study of behavior wants to identify
the range of possibilities of action as a way to chart and pre-
dict results in complex systems. In these complex systems,
the concept of difference--or the change from one state to
the next--was important, because it offered a way to plot,
predict, and program change mathematically.
Henri Lefebvre analyzes the relationship of feedback tech-
nologies to control in the way cybernetic systems are utilized
to shape human communication in a "bureaucratic society of
controlled consumption." The idea of bureaucratically con-
trolled consumption is most clearly articulated in Lefebvre's
Everyday Life in the Modern World. He argues that society
and its various "sub-systems" are functionally organized and
rationalized, and produced and reproduced though program-
ming, obsolescence, and management via cybernetic systems.
It is our everyday lives where this control, in the form of pro-
gramming, takes place (Lefebvre, 1984). An important take-
away from this is thinking about how cybernetic systems
have the potential to produce as much control as they do free-
dom. This view of societal control exists in the intense amount
of data that cybernetic systems collect and that human statisti-
cians and computer-based algorithms interpret, which has
become a central force in how media industries understand
and shape their relationship to audiences.
To Gilles Deleuze, the networked nature of audiences and
contemporary media does not work against a society of con-
trol, but rather is a chief feature of a control society. In his
short work, "Postscript on the Societies of Control," Deleuze
discusses the transition from a disciplinary society built on
enclosure--as you move from the hospital, to the factory, to
the school--to a control society built on more open-ended
forms of continuous control where technology interlinks all
these previously separate domains. In this formulation, the
modes of a control society are not unyielding but flexible--
something Lev Manovich (2002) would call "modular"
(p. 28). These systems of control are at the crux of a contra-
diction where freedom of spatial movement is paired with
constant monitoring, auditing, and adjustment. As Gilles
Deleuze (1992) says, a society of control is one where the
"controls are a modulation" (p. 3). In other words, this logic
of control is flexible, reconfigurable, and fast. "Control is
about the constant subtle structuring of social life, the ways
that we are sorted, tracked, cajoled, and tempted" (Wise,
2011, p. 162).
With all these data--credit scores, faces, passports, driv-
er's licenses, search patterns, website visited--we have per-
haps transitioned from the individuals of the disciplinary
societies to the "dividuals" of the control society (Deleuze,
1992, p. 5). To Deleuze, "dividuals" are not us, per se; they
"can be seen as those data that are aggregated to form unified
subjects" (Cheney-Lippold, 2011, p. 169). In this way, there
is a constant feedback loop between how we imagine our-
selves and the categories created for us by all these data.
John Cheney-Lippold (2011) sees the "digital construction of
categories of identity" as a new axis of soft control where
"control can be enacted through a series of guiding, deter-
mining, and persuasive mechanisms" (p. 169).
Applying Tiziana Terranova's (2004) ideas about soft
control is also instructive here because how television com-
panies use social media to collect and map audience data acts
like the open environment "biological computing" systems
she identifies in Network Culture.7 To Terranova, these envi-
ronments are characterized by potentially enormous produc-
tivity; their difficulty to control; "nonlinear interactions,
feedback loops, and mutations"; and a central designer that
wishes to produce an "emergent behavior" out of other actors
(pp. 104-105).
For Terranova (2004), "biological computing models"
have a moment of construction, then a positioning of con-
straints, and, finally, the "moment of emergence of a useful
or pleasing form" (p. 118). Control is implemented in the
beginning (founding the model) and the end (the survival of
the most "useful or pleasing variations") (Terranova, 2004,
p. 118). If no "pleasing variations are found, then the model
is fine-tuned" and sent through another modeling run
(Terranova, 2004, p. 119).
Imagine biological computing on a much larger scale and
you get close to conceptualizing what television companies
are doing. Twitter's TV Genome allows looks like an open-
ended biological computing model. For instance, let us say
Twitter analyzes the responses to an episode of The New
Girl. The data sets are theoretically open as tweets only trig-
ger algorithms when certain parameters are met. The actors
here--the tweeters--are given relative autonomy. They are
not told their data are being used and whether Twitter
"ingests" this tweet or not does not affect the tweet. This
ingested tweet is paired with a range of other tweets to create
data for the Fox Network to view via Bluefin's Signals
App--an application that aggregates and displays the infor-
mation from the TV Genome specific to that client. And like
a biological model, it is open to change depending on when,
where, and what people tweet. Thus, it is open ended; the TV
Genome is always transforming. This mode of open-ended
control works because it does not "require an absolute and
total knowledge of all the states of each single component of
the system" (Terranova, 2004, p. 119). As more people tweet
and as Twitter tweaks its algorithms, the analysis of these
tweets has the potential to gain in complexity.
According to Madeline Akrich (1992), "a large part of the
work of innovators is that of inscribing this vision of (or pre-
diction about) the world in the technical content of a new
object" (p. 208, emphasis added). In this way, designers
attempt to "define a framework" for how audiences will
engage a particular object. Of course, no audience may come
forth or they may do something radically different from the
intended use, as was the case in how photoelectric light kits
made in France were actually used in ancillary markets in
Africa (Akrich, 1992). The failure of a particular object to be
Lahey 7
"correct" for an audience does not signify the end of the road
per se. Rather, the experience translates into data to be fed
back into the design process where designers redefine "actors
with specific tastes, competences, motives, aspirations, polit-
ical prejudices, and the rest" (Akrich, 1992, p. 208).
In the process of inscribing an object with particular uses,
designers "script" potential outcomes. If we focus on the
design of an object like a short promotional video, then we
get a certain orientation to what design can be. We may think
about lighting, actors, editing, rhetorical appeals present via
dialogue, and so on. Talking about designer scripts that work
in the background forces us to take a different approach.
When I talk about background designer scripts in the Twitter­
television relationship, I am referring to how user data are
ingested, mapped, reduced, and made actionable through
various audience retention strategies. Thus, in a sense, these
scripts, that is, algorithms, lay dormant, waiting for users to
do the work. Background design scripts may best be seen as
proto-design, running as a parallel process to the creation of
design objects, services, and environments.
The data that algorithms behind the TV Genome collect
are used to shape the direction of television companies as
they come to grips with an environment that works against
dictating windows of distribution. The background algo-
rithms are used to create the structured tracking, personaliza-
tion, and responsiveness that are becoming an important part
of how television relates to digital media environments.
Furthermore, the collection of data allows television a richer
picture of the rhythms, places, and practices of the everyday
lives of audience members. That these data are dynamic
offers the potential for an even more complex rendering of
our everyday lives as companies "measure" and "adjust"
their relationship to audiences. Thus, the moment data are
mapped, reduced, and fed back into audience retention strat-
egies is when we can see a logic soft control.
Conclusion
I have been looking at the role of data as a background script
in designing soft control into the relationship of television to
the everyday lives of digitally enabled audiences. On one
hand, it is frustrating that we cannot know more; no company
is going to share its proprietary algorithms or tell you specifi-
cally how data become actionable. On the other hand, there
are still some important lessons to glean from an acknowl-
edgment these background scripts are in place.
First, the feedback loop between tweets, the TV Genome,
and television industry practices is significantly sustained
through the role algorithms play in shaping our everyday
life. While I have been looking at the role algorithms play in
extending the scope of industrial data collection, according
to Tarleton Gillespie (2012), "algorithms play an increas-
ingly important role in selecting what information is consid-
ered most relevant to us, a crucial feature of our participation
in public life" (p. 1). Thus, we have algorithms that read
tweets as data on one end, and algorithms that suggest search
engine results on Google on the other end.
The important point to note here is how these algorithms
work in our everyday life not by hailing us--calling for any
particular mode of address--but my working in the back-
ground to collect "wild" data from our experiences of being
alive and communicating. Eli Parsier (2012), in The Filter
Bubble, says we tell ourselves a reassuring story. In a broad-
cast society, editors largely had control of the flow of infor-
mation. They could tell us when, where, and how. The
Internet ostensibly swept these structures away. But rather
than the baton of control being passed to us, it has been
passed from industrial gatekeepers to algorithmic ones.
Second, I want to point out that the amount of data col-
lected by a company like Twitter (and, remember, they are but
one player in this larger field of data collection) helps identify
logics of soft control by reinforcing an asymmetry of informa-
tion between those who hold data and those who do not. The
"information flow" goes from our social media work to their
databases and not the other way around (Solove, 2004, p. 162).
In the amount of knowable things circulating today--the
texts of our everyday lives, or at least the information traces
these texts leave behind--we can start to see the way
Deleuze's society of control might work. As entities like the
television industry create more sophisticated portraits of
whom we are, they arguably gain the upper hand in pattern-
ing their practices toward our digital habits. As a nod to
Pierre Bourdieu, these corporations know my habitus per-
haps better than I do.

5. See Stephen Fox (1977), The Mirror Makers. In this book on
the history of creativity and research in the formation of the
advertising industry, Fox retells the tale of market researcher
James Vicary's claim that he significantly raised sales of Coke
and popcorn by slipping subliminal messages into movies.
This claim turned out, surprisingly, not to be true. Also see
Charles Acland's (2011) Swift Viewing, where he positions
popular understandings of subliminal influence as a way of
coming to grips with social change in consumer society, and
later in the information age.
6. Note that cybernetics'view of machinery is much broader than
its popular usage. A machine is anything that can interact and
change whether metal or biological.
