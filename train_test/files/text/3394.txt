Introduction
An efficient and effective health care system significantly
contributes to a higher quality of life and a higher level of
human development. The effects of a good health care sys-
tem can be observed in the productivity of the workforce,
which in turn contributes to higher economic growth.
Therefore, the assurance of a successful health care system
should be a priority in any country. Health care expenditures
in developed countries comprise 8% to 16% of GDP, whereas
employees in the health and social work sector account for
6% to 20% of all employees (Organization for Economic
Co-Operation and Development, 2014). The health care sys-
tems in the majority of European countries are designed so
that the largest portion, in terms of both health service pro-
viders and funding, remains within the public sector
(Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development,
2014). The state should use its powers to ensure public sector
organizations (including health care organizations) operate
in an efficient and effective manner. One of the characteris-
tics of the majority of public sector organizations is that their
performance greatly depends on the successful management
of human resources.
Employee performance appraisals (PA) can support a
wide range of human resource decision-making activities
including pay raise, promotion, demotion, termination, and
training of employees (Osman, Berbary, Sidani, Al-Ayoubi,
& Emrouznejad, 2011). Well-designed and properly used
appraisal systems are essential for effective functioning of
organizations (Manoharan, Muralidharan, & Deshmukh,
2009).
Research on PA has evolved from a pure focus on how to
measure performance to examining the social context where
performance appraisal takes place (Prasad, Suar, & Taraban,
2014; Zheng, Zhang, & Li, 2012). Evaluating and ranking
the employees working in organizations are challenging
tasks involving several factors. Each employee achieves cer-
tain performance levels in various factors, and the resulting
information can be overwhelming (Manoharan et al., 2009).
The development of PA system is especially important for
leaders. Leaders can affect organization performance in differ-
ent ways. Devising more effective ways of managing the per-
formance of managers and leaders has become a cornerstone of
organizational and leadership development in recent years
(Cheng, Dainty, & Moore, 2005). Effective management and

Three-Stage Data Envelopment Analysis
as a Tool for Nurse Leader Performance
Appraisals: Case Study
Janko Seljak1 and Andreja Kvas1
Abstract
As in other sectors, increasingly higher performance and efficiency are also being required from health care employees. To
achieve this goal, every health care organization should have a suitable human resource management system. The selection,
education, training, effective performance appraisal, and evaluation of leaders are particularly of key importance for every
organization. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used in this study to develop a model of practice outputs and inputs to help
identify the most efficient nurse leaders. The employees' performance appraisals are often closely related to their specific
organizations. As leaders' behaviors are also influenced by external, non-discretionary factors, the three-stage DEA was used
to include inputs not controlled by individual leaders. This article proposes a performance appraisal based on competency
models of leadership for a larger professional group working across several different organizations, yet in similar professional
and institutional environments. The empirical data in this article are based on two surveys that were conducted in 15
Slovenian public hospitals.

leadership are critical aspects of well-performing organiza-
tions and programs.
One of the most frequently used new approaches in human
resources management is the study of competencies and
competency models (Cappellen & Janssens, 2008; Wu,
2013). A competence is an action that can be monitored,
evaluated, and whose efficiency can be measured. On that
basis, we can define a leadership competence model as a sys-
tem of key competences, designed based on research of key
indicators of effective behavior of leaders (Kvas, Seljak, &
Stare, 2013). Competencies can only be defined on the basis
of observation of the behavior of the individual (actions in
real situations; Stare & Seljak, 2013). They have become an
important tool for introducing changes in organizations and
in changing the behavior of the individual (Plessius &
Ravesteyn, 2010).
In the competency approach, we compare employees'
performance against performance standards or desired
behaviors (Cheng et al., 2005). Competency based PAs have
been seen as a powerful tool to underpin many human
resource management activities also in healthcare organiza-
tions (Osman et al., 2011; Rosenfeld, Pyc, Rosati, & Marren,
2012). Such assessments can help to define job characteris-
tics and desired levels of performance and hence, can pro-
vide a basis for many aspects of the human resource
management in health care (Cheng et al., 2005).
Nurse leaders need to be familiar with the operation of the
health care system, possess knowledge and skills from the
areas of leadership, communication, and employee motiva-
tion, and possess the ability to work in a team, ability to solve
complex problems, and ability to work with health and other
institutions. They usually perform a dual role--a profes-
sional and a leadership role, which require additional knowl-
edge and skills (Hogan & Nickitas, 2009; Yoder-Wise,
2011b).
A relatively long chain of leadership hierarchy has been
forged in professional groups such as nursing: ranging from
the nursing director, leaders of wards, clinics, and sectors at
the top level to the charge nurse and team leader on the first-
line management level. Not only are people in top positions
(top managers and leaders) important in the organization
here, but also the entire hierarchical management structure
within it (Kvas & Seljak, 2013b; Twedell & Jackson Gray,
2007).
The competency model of leadership in nursing emerged
in Slovenia between 2009 and 2011 (Kvas & Seljak, 2011;
Kvas et al., 2013). It consists of generic leadership compe-
tencies (behaviors or actions) that show the characteristics of
all leaders and role-specific competencies that are consid-
ered to be characteristic of leaders in nursing. Generic com-
petencies comprise flexibility at work, creativity, leadership,
organizational climate, organization, networking/influence,
and realization skills.
Based on analysis of the theory of nursing, leadership,
and competency models (Biesma et al., 2008; International
Council of Nurses, 2012; Yoder-Wise, 2011b), three groups
of role-specific competencies were selected:
·
· Ethics: competencies demonstrating the ethical or
non-ethical conduct of nurses in leadership positions
·
· Interprofessional relationships: competencies demon-
strating correct understanding of the position of nurses
in the health care system and their relationships to
doctors
·
· A positive attitude toward knowledge and education:
competencies demonstrating the attitude of nurses in
leadership positions toward their own and their subor-
dinates' education
A PA can only be successful if it includes as many differ-
ent aspects and results of employees' work as possible.
Leadership outputs in particular should cover a wide range of
performance measures (Osman et al., 2011). The complex
nature of the relationship between multiple inputs and mul-
tiple outputs involved must be taken into account when
developing and applying competency models. The main
research problem of our study was how to incorporate a large
number of different aspects and results of nurse leaders'
work into a unified system that enables consistent classifica-
tion. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a method that has
often been used for performance appraisals based on a large
number of inputs and outputs.
The main aim of this study is to assess leader performance
in nursing care using a competency-based PA. DEA will be
used to
·
· identify the leaders with the highest and lowest per-
formance appraisals,
·
· identify peers for leaders with the lowest performance
appraisals,
·
· identify what areas leaders with the lowest appraisals
should improve performance and quantify the perfor-
mance improvement required in these areas, and
·
· compare leadership performance among the 15 hospi-
tals that participated in the study.
Method
Basic DEA
DEA was proposed by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978),
as a non-parametric method of efficiency analysis to com-
pare the relative performance of units relative to their best
peers (efficient frontier) rather than average performers, and
to identify benchmarks for inefficient units. The virtual pro-
ductivity ratio * o o
= u Y v X
r i
* *
/ is maximized subject to the
condition that the virtual ratio  of any unit j does not exceed
1, and all the weights are strictly positive. This non-linear
model can then be rewritten more explicitly in a linear for-
mat as follows (Osman et al., 2011):

th decision-making unit
(DMU) being assessed in the set of j = 1, . . ., n DMUs,
 is a non-Archimedean value to enforce strict positivity of
the weights,
yrj is the observed amount of rth output produced by
DMU j,
xij is the quantity of ith input used by DMU j,
ur is the weight given to output r as determined by the linear
programming, and
vi is the weight given to input i as determined by the linear
programming.
Originally, DEA was designed to empirically measure
productive efficiency of homogeneous DMUs. When
expanding the use of DEA to other areas (public administra-
tion, measuring employee efficiency in various organiza-
tions, etc.), one should ensure that the precondition of
homogeneity of the DMU is met. The efficiency of a DMU is
usually influenced by a variety of factors that are difficult to
define with a small number of inputs.
DEA is most commonly used for assessing the efficiency
of organizations and individuals. The most commonly
assessed organizations include banks (Jablonsky, 2012),
police departments (Aristovnik, Seljak, & Mencinger, 2013),
physician practices (Rosenman & Friesner, 2004), hospitals
(Pham, 2011), and nursing homes (Garavaglia, Lettieri,
Agasisti, & Lopez, 2011).
DEA-based employee PA or efficiency assessments are
used for employees in industry (Tao, 2012), physicians
(Chilingerian & Sherman, 2011), and nurses (Osman et al.,
2011). Most of these studies assessed efficiency within a single
organization or in similar cultural or working environments. To
compare employees in different organizations and at different
levels of leadership, the analysis must include additional vari-
ables to offset the influence of elements outside the control of
an individual (or the organization that employs them).
DEA With Non-Discretionary or External Inputs
The basic DEA models assumed that all inputs were discretion-
ary. However, in practice, the results of production processes
also depend on the effect of another type of variables that are
beyond the DMU control (Cordero, Pedraja, & Santín, 2009).
These non-discretionary or external inputs affect the trans-
formation of discretionary inputs into outputs (Ruggiero,
1998). Therefore, the only way the DMU can correctly be
evaluated is by taking into account the influence of those
external variables on efficiency scores, so that they can be
interpreted as an appropriate measure of their performance.
This approach in the first stage estimates efficiency scores
with basic DEA program using only the discretionary inputs.
This produces a measure of the total inefficiency for the dif-
ferent DMUs comprising contributions both from the non-
discretionary variables and non-measurable DMU
inefficiency. Subsequently, a regression analysis is used in
the second stage to decompose both of them. Therefore,
exogenous variables (z
j
) are explanatory variables, and the
dependent variable is the first-stage efficiency score ( 
 j
;
Cordero et al., 2009):
  µ
 j j j
f z
= ( )+
, .
This regression can be estimated by ordinary least squares,
although the use of a Tobit regression is more widespread
(Deyneli, 2011). Tobit regression is often used for data that
are censored or truncated. Censored data occur when the val-
ues of the data are clustered around some threshold, either
lower (left-censored) or upper (right-censored; Walker &
Maddan, 2008). From the value of estimated coefficients, it
is possible to identify the influential variables and their sign
(positive or negative) and also to weigh the importance of
each external variable in the efficiency estimate (Cordero et
al., 2009).
In the third stage, DEA will be conducted using the dis-
cretionary and non-discretionary input variables. The newly
obtained values are introduced to the original DEA frame-
work as an input, adjusting for the uncontrollable environ-
mentalfactorsthroughtheuseofacombinednon-discretionary
input. This model restricts the comparison set by removing
from the potential reference set any DMU that has a more
favorable environment than the unit under analysis.
There has been a growing interest in the literature to study
how the effect of exogenous variables can be included in
efficiency measures in such different sectors as education,
banking, or sports (Cordero et al., 2009). We can find articles
that have addressed this issue also in the health sector. DEAs
with non-discretionary inputs are used to compare nursing
homes (Fizel & Nunnikhoven, 1992), hospitals (Chilingerian
& Sherman, 2011), or dialysis facilities (Kontodimopoulos,
Papathanasiou, Flokou, Tountas, & Niakas, 2011).
Research Design and Participants
The study was part of a larger research project titled "Leaders
in Health Care." Following a literature review and input
from an expert group, two questionnaires were designed spe-
cifically for the purposes of the research. In the first
4 SAGE Open
questionnaire, subordinates assessed the levels of 95 actions
of their leaders. In the second questionnaire, leaders assessed
what traits and characteristics they possess. Two surveys
were conducted within a research project carried out from
May 18, 2010, to April 30, 2011.
The survey was conducted in 13 greatest Slovenian gen-
eral and special hospitals and 2 university medical centers
that account for 87% of all hospital health care employees in
Slovenia.
The sample from the first survey included 1,311 health
care professionals who assessed the level of competencies of
their immediate superiors. Of the 1,311 health care profes-
sionals, 84.3% were female. The average age of subordinates
was 38.5 years; 59.2% had a secondary education, 34.4%
postsecondary or professional college, 2.7% bachelor's
degree or higher.
The sample from the second survey included 236 nurse
leaders, who were asked to provide information regarding
their education and job experience, and assess their knowl-
edge, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and lev-
els of interpersonal and interprofessional relationships. The
data from second survey were used as discretionary inputs.
Of the 236 nurse leaders, 7.2% were men. The average age of
subordinates was 42.3 years. Those who had a postsecondary
education or professional college comprised 88.6%, and
those with a bachelor's degree or higher comprised 11.4%.
The interconnection of the data from first and second sur-
veys was ensured with a coding system. The data for non-
discretionary inputs were obtained from hospital records.
Data
DEA can incorporate various types of data. Our study com-
bined interval and ordinal data. Although interval data have
been used for DEA since it was developed, the use of ordinal
data has become more frequent only recently. Many authors
utilized a 5-point Likert-type scale to convert qualitative data
into quantitative data for use in evaluations of performance
using DEA (Manoharan et al., 2009).
Our study used data from various sources and aspects;
therefore, we also needed to prevent a possible data imbal-
ance. One of the best ways of making sure there is not much
imbalance in the data sets is to have them at the same or simi-
lar magnitude. A way of making sure the data are of the same
or similar magnitude across and within data sets is to mean
normalize the data. The process to mean normalize is taken
in two simple steps. First step is to find the mean of the data
set for each input and output. The second step is to divide
each input or output by the mean for that specific factor
(Sarkis, 2007). Mean normalization was used to normalize
data for outputs and discretionary inputs.
Outputs.The focus of our model is to enhance the output,
rather than decrease the inputs. The outputs for evaluation
that can be controlled by the entities are important, because
it is generally not very informative or motivating to be judged
on the basis of factors that you cannot control (Bogetoft &
Otto, 2011). On the output side, it is important that the speci-
fication encompasses the full range of leaders' behaviors.
The competency models are based on the assessment of
behavior in actual situations. Contrary to the prevailing
method of self-evaluation in measuring leadership behavior,
we propose subordinates evaluation. The most reliable
assessments of leaders are provided by people who are most
familiar with their work--their immediate subordinates.
Subordinates assessed 95 actions of their leaders, which
were divided into four groups of competencies. This resulted
in four outputs: (a) generic competencies of leaders in public
sector, (b) ethical competencies, (c) interprofessional rela-
tionship, and (d) positive attitude toward knowledge and
education (Kvas et al., 2013). Each of the groups of compe-
tencies was used as a single output variable, representing an
aggregate performance indicator of the level of leadership in
a specific area (Table 1).
Assessments of each leader and their behavior provided
us with information regarding the degree to which they meet
the norm defined in the competency profile. The assessed
level of competencies of each nurse leader was compared
with leadership competency profiles developed within the
research of the leadership competency model in nursing care
(Kvas & Seljak, 2011).
The relationship between the output variables was esti-
mated using the Pearson's coefficient. Pearson's coefficients
among the output variables scored between 0.789 and 0.876,
p < .01 (Table 2), which means they were lower than the
maximum threshold, which in DEAstudies was 0.95 (García-
Sánchez, 2009). Therefore, all four were included in the
analysis.
Discretionary inputs. All discretionary inputs are (or could be)
influenced by individual leaders. Input data were obtained
from a survey submitted to leaders. We defined six indica-
tors, which indicate what traits and characteristics leaders
possess and which they presumably utilized for efficient
leadership: (a) level of formal education, (b) skills and expe-
rience (total years of employment), (c) self-assessment of
knowledge, (d) job satisfaction, (e) communication and
interpersonal relationships, and (f) organizational culture and
commitment to the profession (Hogan & Nickitas, 2009;
Kvas & Seljak, 2013a; Westover, Westover, & Westover,
2009).
Pearson's coefficients among the output variables scored
between 0.09 and 0.35. Therefore, all six indicators were
included in the analysis.
Non-discretionary inputs.The second phase of the DEA
includes non-discretionary inputs that influence leadership
performance, but are not directly related to the leader. There-
fore, influences not directly linked to an individual but rather
to the characteristics of the hospital and their job position
Seljak and Kvas 5
needed to be excluded from the first phase of DEA. Non-
discretionary inputs represent characteristics of the leader's
job position or the leader's organization: (a) the type (level)
of leadership position, (b) number of subordinates, (c) type
of hospital, and (d) number of health care employees.
The correlation between the non-discretionary inputs was
low. The only statistically significant correlation arose
between the number of health care employees and the type of
hospital (r = .737, p < .01). The analysis therefore includes
all four variables.

Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed using Frontier analyst 4.1.0 and
SPSS 19.0. Output-oriented DEA model with constant
returns to scale is used in this study. Relationships between
variables were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. A signifi-
cance level of alpha = .05 was used for all statistical tests.
Results
Leaders with an efficiency score of 100 are efficient, and less
than that value are categorized as inefficient (Table 3). This
efficiency is a relative term, and it is related with a subgroup of
individuals with whom the examined DMU is best compared.
A total of 203 (86%) leaders could improve their leader-
ship performance based on their potential. The average age
of inefficient leaders is 42.9 years. Seventeen of 203 (8.4%)
are men. Thirty-three leaders achieved an efficiency score of
100 and represent a role model for peers displaying lower
assessments.
Table 4 shows the basic demographic data and leadership
performance appraisals of the two lowest scoring leaders.
The performance appraisal values achieved by leaders and
possibilities for improvement are shown for each of the four
groups of competencies (outputs). The assessment shows the
degree to which they would need to improve, based on exist-
ing inputs to achieve the performance level of their role
model. Similar representations can be compiled for each of
the 203 leaders performing below requirements.
Leader 1 achieved a relatively high score in ethics, but
scored significantly lower in other areas. This leader has a
peer within the same hospital with whom to compare himself
or herself against and learn from and exchange experience
with.

One of the major advantages of DEA is its ability to show
the improvements necessary to achieve efficiency. In the
comparison with the peer, Leader 1's greatest potential for
improvement lies in the area of generic competencies. This
illustration shows that an increase in outputs does not depend
merely on the absolute values of outputs of an individual
leader but also on peers in their organization. The logic
behind this example is that the improvement process begins
with an exchange between higher and lower scoring leaders
within an organization.
The second poorest score was achieved by a leader whose
assessment showed the lowest results in ethics and attitude
toward education. Leader 2 also has a peer within his or her
hospital who could help improve Leader 2's outputs.
We then prepared an overview of leadership performance
in all 15 hospitals within the scope of the final research ques-
tion of the analysis (Table 5). It is in the interest of hospitals
to use their leaders as efficiently as possible, for the perfor-
mance of health care organizations, particularly in the public
sector, greatly depends on the efficiency of their leaders.
This overview shows that eight hospitals employ efficient
leaders who could serve as role models for their peers.
Hospitals 6, 8, 9, and 12 employed more than 20 % of effi-
cient leaders. The average efficiency score exceeded 80 in
only 3 hospitals. In comparison, the two ranking orders of
hospital scores show certain differences. Although the hospi-
tal with the highest score, Hospital 10, has no efficient lead-
ers, Hospital 12, with 27.8% of all highest scoring leaders,
only has an average performance score of 79.9, ranking
fourth among all hospitals.
The ANOVA analysis reveals that arithmetic means of
efficiency score of hospitals do not show any statistically
significant differences. Therefore, we also used the post­ad
hoc analysis. The lowest-ranking hospital, Hospital 4, shows
statistically significant differences from Hospitals 8 (p =
.021), 10 (p = .041), and 12 (p = .020). The highest ranking
hospital shows statistically significant differences from
Hospitals 2 (p = .049), 4 (p = .030), and 7 (p = .045). Based
on these results, Hospital 4 could cooperate with Hospital 8,
10, or 12, and attempt to improve performance by exchang-
ing good practices with them. Similarly, the top-ranking
three hospitals could work together and organize leadership
seminars or workshops.
Table 5 shows the necessary percentages of improvement
for the four groups of competencies. The improvements are
necessary in the areas of competencies related to interprofes-
sional relationships (Hospitals 7, 10, and 13) and generic
competencies (all remaining hospitals).
Discussion
The poorest score was achieved in the competence area of
generic competencies. The lack of generic leadership compe-
tencies and the importance of their development in nurse
leaders have also been shown in other studies. To achieve
better leadership, in the future, nurse leaders will require a

higher level of competencies in the areas of strategic think-
ing, use of financial/quantitative data, quality commitment
(Bradley, Maddox, & Spears, 2008), leadership, strategic
view (Furukawa & Cunha, 2011), and job planning and
assignment and goal setting (Lin, Wu, & White, 2005).
Nurse leaders view nursing care as empathetic and caring
work (Boeck, 2014) rather than as a rational decision-mak-
ing process required from leaders and managers. They are
not prepared to fully accept the role of leaders. The problem
of role transition has also appeared in other research (Twedell
& Jackson Gray, 2007). Nurse leaders even at the lowest
leadership level should be aware of the importance of their
role as leaders and become active in developing and chang-
ing health care practices and leadership (Currie, Tolson, &
Booth, 2007). A survey of nurse leaders in Slovenia showed
that nurse leaders were aware that they did not have enough
management and leadership knowledge--generic leadership
competencies (Lorber & Skela Savic, 2011). This indicates
that the work of nurse leaders requires new knowledge that
expands beyond the borders of specific professional fields.
Most continuing education programs for nurses are orga-
nized for narrow professional fields of nurses'work (cardiol-
ogy, psychology, etc.). In addition to field-specific
professional knowledge, other programs also need to be
organized that would focus not only on a single topic or field
but also on comprehensive education (Yoder-Wise, 2011a).
One such area is leadership as it incorporates different scien-
tific fields (human resources management, sociology, psy-
chology, economics, etc.)
The second poorest score was achieved in the competence
area of interprofessional cooperation. Leadership in nursing
depends on relationships within the professional group of
nurses as well as relationships with other professions in the
health care sector. These relationships depend on the role of
the medical profession in society and the state's approach to
health and health care. In the past, the role of leader in the
health care team was assumed by the physician (Hall, 2005).
However, nowadays, the successful implementation of team
work can only be carried out through equal participation of
all professions working in the field of health care in the form
of interprofessional and trans-professional teams (Thylefors,
Persson, & Hellstrom, 2005).
Nurse leaders would above all focus on interpersonal rela-
tionships between nurses and other members of the health
care team (West & Lyubovnikova, 2013). Communications
of nurse leaders with other leaders are frequent both inside
and outside the organization. Best practices in health care
teams should therefore comprise good interpersonal and
interprofessional relationships (Furukawa & Cunha, 2011;
Spicer et al., 2011) that incorporate respect for the work of
other team members. A study of other professional groups
also showed appropriate communication between team
members (and with other stakeholders) to be an important
component of team success, being even more important than
experience, work history, and education (Stevenson &
Starkweather, 2010).
The analysis based on our research provides important
information for three groups of stakeholders:
·
· Nurse leaders can use the analysis results as a guide-
line for which areas they need to improve their com-
petencies. During their studies, nurses adopt
professional values and accept learning and training
as an integral part of their profession. Based on the
PAs, individual leaders can find peers within the orga-
nization to serve as role models. The assessment also
shows the degree to which they would need to improve
to achieve the performance level of their role model.
·
· Less efficient leaders and their role models (or "nurse
trainers") could form study groups in which they
could exchange ideas and learn. The highest manage-
ment structures of hospitals have the task of ensuring
the appropriate conditions for nurses to become and
remain good leaders. Hospital managers need to
ensure that potential of nurse leaders is realized in the
form of better leadership and a higher quality of health
care.
·
· National Health Service managers: All 15 participat-
ing hospitals are included in the public health care
system and are, thereby, a part of the public sector.
The state as the owner of all public organizations
should understand these results as an indication that
certain differences in leadership performance exist.
Differences exist both among leaders and among hos-
pitals. The state should promote better leadership in
nursing care through its representatives in hospital
management. The state should also, within its compe-
tencies, organize training for nurse leaders in areas
showing poorer scores and promote exchanges of
good practices among hospitals.
In future, it would be worthwhile conducting the surveys
in all Slovenian health care organizations. The study included
only nurse leaders in Slovenian public hospitals. Conditions
are probably different in smaller health care organizations
(health centers or nursing homes) and in private hospitals. A
larger sample of leaders would also allow for the inclusion of
additional inputs in the DEA.
Further research would also be required in assessing the
level of competencies. Assessment of the competencies of
leaders by subordinates was used in this study. The ratings
would have been different if assessments of superiors or
leader self-assessments had been used. Some studies suggest
that these estimates could differ significantly (Kvas & Seljak,
2013b). In the future, surveys should be carried out among
all three groups and the evaluations compared.
Conclusion
Tasks performed by nurse leaders are similar, as are their cul-
tural and working environments. Nurses are a professional
group, and a characteristic of professional groups is that one
Seljak and Kvas 9
does not become a member solely on the basis of education
and training but also by sharing the values of the professional
group. The employees' PAs are often closely related to their
specific organizations. This article proposes a PA based on
competency models of leadership for a larger professional
group working across several different organizations, yet in
similar professional and institutional environments.
Leaders' PAs are also influenced by the characteristics of
the job position and organization. By including non-discre-
tionary inputs, the analysis also takes into account these
additional factors. To assess the PA, this research used the
three-stage DEA, which incorporated both discretionary
inputs--inputs related to leaders' characteristics, which they
can influence--and non-discretionary inputs on which lead-
ers have no influence, at least not in the short term. This
enabled us to ensure better comparability among leaders
employed in different organizations and improved the homo-
geneity of the DMU. The calculated values of leadership per-
formance allow comparisons among leaders employed in
different organizations.
